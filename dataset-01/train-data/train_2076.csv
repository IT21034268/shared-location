4,"Good toy, but my 4 month old doesn't like it much","This toy has crinkle sounds on the wings, a mirror, a squeaky button, a fuzzy ball for baby to touch, a teether, rings at the bottom and lastly the center 'body' rattles. Perhaps when my baby is bigger he will appreciate the diversity of features on this toy, but for now he just wants to put it in his mouth and he gets frustrated that it's too big. The sounds do seems to capture his interest a bit. Like the concept but I think it's overrated personally. It is a good toy, just maybe better for an older baby."
3,It is colorful toy but not worth of its price,"when I ordered I liked because it is very colorful and has few things on it which should be good on the go , but found it is little big for small hands and rest of the features(tether , mirror etc) are not much useful . It is little expensive for its worth.It is ok to have but can explore more options."
3,It's ok,"We have three of these toys and this one is kind of in the middle between moose and peacock. My daughter 4,5 month is interested in it when she sees it for a few minutes. However, wings are not really comfortable for her to pull into her mouth and she loses her interest pretty quick."
4,The Chosen One is beautifully written-,I am the manager of a bookstore and have read a good chunk of the books out there. I was approached by Maria and was inspired to read her story. This story is true and very heartwarming. It is a quick read & well worth the time. This is a perfect gift for someone who was adopted & looking for their biological parents or for someone who needs to be inspired. The only critisism I have is that I wish it didn't end so soon. Maria Mourning Dove thank you for sharing your story with the world!
3,Good Value,"For the price you should add this book to your collection. There are quite a few nice color pictures in the book, but there are also a few errors in some of the stats and photos. There isn't much detail or statistics for the researcher. It is organized by decades and not all models are covered. Photos are worth it- put it on your coffee table!"
3,Just ok!,Video was just ok. Would of liked more footage of accommodation and eateries! Video lacked pertinent information to assist with planning our trip.
1,Camino de Santiago a walkers guide.,"This fuzzy, amateur DVD totally missed the point of walking the Camino.There was no interest in anything spiritual or generous and the camera-man was amazingly intrusive and insensitive to the feelings of the other travellers when filming them. I would hate to meet people like this on the pilgrimage. No! I would hate to meet people like this anywhere! They are just too shallow. And they make us pay for their poor quality work too. Enough! Anthony Morris"
3,Good for indoors but not great outside,"Robeez are great for new walkers because experts recommend a flexible shoe that's as close to barefoot as possible. But suede bottoms are not good for playgrounds, and toddlers don't need shoes indoors. So we go barefoot inside and get a similar shoe with a thin rubber sole for outside. The Robeez are cute, but I really wish they had a better sole for walkers."
3,Go to Target for the off-brand and save yourself lots of $$,"I do really like the Robeez for my baby, but you can buy shoes that are styled very VERY similarly (leather and soft-soled, even look just like Robeez) for half the price at Target. Unless you just *must* have that tiny tag that says ""Robeez"" on it, save yourself the $$ and go to Target."
5,Nice Baton and Comes with Plastic Case!,"I am absolutely no expert on conducting batons, but I am happy with this purchase for my conducting class. I have small to medium hands, and the end fits nicely in the palm of my hand. It comes in a sturdy plastic case, an important consideration that is not mentioned in the description."
5,Excellent Quality,"I bought this for my son's saxophone as he has been taking the sax at school. He had another mouthpiece saver that he had purchased from the band instructor at school. The one we paid for from the school was flimsy and cheap plastic and was about the same price as this one I purchased from Amazon.I am very impressed with the quality of this product and the durability of the design. Since it is being used by my son, I wanted something that would not break, would serve the purpose and would protect our investment in the saxophone. Well, this is a great product and I strongly reccomend it to anyone that is looking for quality and durable design at a reasonable price.Very good product and design! 5-stars!!!"
3,Somewhat interesting scholarly study,"This book details Castro's use of Marti, the Cuban patriot, in his speeches and his rhetoric to try to legitimize his regime. It would have been nice to compare this to how the Cuban-Americans in Miami also claim Marti as supporting their views but Rice's study prefers to focus on Fidel's speeches. A rare balanced book on Cuban affairs. Unfortunately, a very dry account as well."
1,RETURN,"The thermometer I received had a fatal flaw: the clip is made of aluminum, a soft metal.When you clip the thermometer to the pot, the aluminum bends open. The sensing part of the thermometer then slides to and touches the edge of the pot.Since the pot is hotter than the liquid inside, the thermometer indicates the liquid is 5 to 10 degrees hotter it actually is, even after calibrating the thermometer."
4,"Fairly accurate, not too slow","I have three glass candy thermometers and this is the best of the bunch. They are all a little slow to respond but this one is actually pretty good. Nice big size, clear and easy to read. Good clip that holds reasonably. None of these clips are ideal, they never are but what are you gonna do? The Polder one I have has a real flimsy clip and the Taylor one I have is too slow. I would go with this one as far as the cheaper glass thermometers go."
1,Nearly Useless,"Too difficult to read where 'soft ball' might be for making fudge, etc. I wanted this for the next generation to be able to make old family recipes that they love, but this won't work for them (nor for me)."
2,Not accurate enough,"I use a thermometer mostly for jam and jelly making. This one is not accurate enough and I ended up with several batches of over-set jam.The interior calibration is on a strip of paper which became wavy the first time I used it, perhaps from condensation admitted though a pressure relief opening.This is also difficult to read through the steam of cooking fruit. I will get a top read next time."
2,Broke first time using it,Finally decided to use my thermometer to make some fudge. First time using it the bulb broke when inserting into the liquid. The thermometer was room temp going into boiling liquid (probably around 200 deg).It does have a lifetime warranty but not worth the $6 I spent to chase down some company for a new one. Purchased a digital insta-read candy thermometer instead.
1,Glass Candy and Deep Fry Thermometer,This thermometer broke the first time I used it leaving glass in the bread dough.
4,pretty neat,Really is identical to a Dr. Pepper can. Has a good weight to it as well. I think my nephew will like it.
3,Damaged,"I was quite excited to get this. When it arrived, the top was actually dented in all around, and it made it hard to get the top back on. Poor quality control. I'm going to replace it, possibly with another company's product."
4,Does what it has to do,"I have many family members with ""sticky fingers""... and this pretty much does the trick... no one will ever know that its not a soda and its identical to the real dr pepper soda can. im satisfied"
1,poorly made,"when i received this in the mail, i was instantly upset. not made very professionally. also not as much room as other soda cans I've previously owned."
1,Other diversion safes from southwest specialty are MUCH better,"The walls of the soda can are just too thin so they had to reinforce with plaster inside, taking up most of the storage space. I bought 6 different safes as christmas gifts, this one was by far the worst and i returned it, all the others are great though. The overall feel and construction of this one just doesnt compare to the quality of others."
3,It's a good gag gift.,"Bought this for a co-worker's birthday that loves Dr. Pepper. Overall, cute gag gift. If you want to use as a safe...the space is very limited in the can. You can hide change or small wad of bills. The can I got had a small dent, but didn't have time to return it."
3,"Great buy, however...","This item is the ideal product to hide anything you have that you do not want anyone to find. However a couple of the six cans I order did come defected and had large dents in them making them not very convincing. However, if you do buy these cans I advise you buy a couple cases of Dr.Pepper so you look more legit."
1,CRAP,I should have trusted the other reviews. You get what you pay for. This item is absolutely crap. Dented-in can that once the top came off it was off for good. I will be returning this P.O.S immediately. DO NOT BUT THIS!! Go for the other options available on this website. You will regret your decision if you purchase this piece of junk can. I sure did. What a piece of CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,TERRIBLE. DO NOT BUY,"I've ordered other diversion cans before this one and they have all worked out great. This one, however, is terrible. It is like it is an empty can with a piece of concrete inside of it. Awfully made. Don't buy this product."
4,Seems really worth it,"The can is great, looks real, only had a small dent in it. What I didn't know buying it was that there is something around the insde container that makes the can feel like an actual soda. The storage space inside the can is small, but you can fit plnty of things in there. I honestly don't see how mold could grow in there with the cement/weight thing taking up a lot of space. Also, shipping was very fast."
2,Ok.....,"OK so i just bought this today, and it does its job, it hides money jewelry etc, but the top already broke off... i just used some hot glue to glue it back on and now its OK, and also they got the plaster thing in the container... luckily it's dried so it wont get on any bills or anything. So overall a poor job.but it does do what its said to do"
3,almost perfect,"When i received the can i had to return it because the glue had become unstuck from the top.New can came in, same problem. Im not going to return it again, i will figure out how to repair it myself.ProsLooks and feels just like a real can of Dr. Pepper."
3,"Cool case, but no room","I purchased this a couple months ago. I kept it inside a glove box so that it would not fly all over my car and get dented. But this can dents way too easily. Obviously there's a reason you have a dented up warm can of dr. pepper in your car. This dented after about two months. I'm kind of sad.. but it's a cheap item so it's not that much of a loss. I just wish this thing was a little more durable. Also, there's limited room inside. I would compare the amount of space to a large round glue stick. I do like this item, but i'm going to have to buy a new one every few months."
3,"Loved it, but... Mold?.","I got this as a gift and loved it. Like most of the other reviews, there is no way to tell the difference between this can and a ""real"" can of DP. However, after 2 months of owning it, I started to notice mold growing under the lip of the plastic tube inside the can. Thinking it might be moisture from the dollar bills I had in the can, I cleaned it off with bleach and added a little rice to the bottom of the can. A week later, the mold was back with a vengeance. After more bleach cleaning and almost a week of no lid on, I tossed out. I will be getting another again. I'm hoping I just got a bad can. I kept it on the shelf in my pantry with a few other cans of soda."
2,"not a good idea, amigos!","I love a diversion safe as much as the next guy, but let me tell you -- consumables dont' make a good place to stash your cash.ex; I once had a mountain Dew bottle diversion safe. kept it in the fridge, looked the part. However, I soon found it to be nearly worthless after witnessing more than one friend make a grab for it when they were thirsty!Imagine having about a dozen or so 100 dollar bills stashed ""in plain sight"" , only to find that someone took it when they're thirsty or hungry! Do yourself a favor and get something less appealing to impulse.I add this to help, but also in the hope that the manufacturers would take note. Perhaps stop producing diversion safes from the food/beverage industry's packaging?Use cleaning products or something, brake cleaner, anything but munchies!I know this Dr Pepper Can is a good buy, but please think about what your intended purpose is before you ""add to cart""."
2,Poor quality,"Super cool concept, but poor construction. I bought this can safe for my Mom, and it broke the first time she opened it."
1,cheaply crafted product..,"damaged product, very cheaply made compared to competitor products. I thought this was a good deal but I was wrong. Should have paid $18 for the real thing because this is not worth a penny."
1,Dammaged,"three damaged spots on the top lid, had to return it back. but the product it self looked great. poor quality control."
3,Dented can,"i ordered four of the cans for presents and three of them were dented. although i like the can-safe, i am disappointed about the dents."
5,Perfect...,"This cutlery tray set is a great solution for any cluttered drawer. Installing did require a few tools (the back of the drawer needs to have a section removed so that the upper tray can ""get out of the way"" of the lower tray). With the appropriate tools this took about 30 minutes. Trimming the base tray was simple and the results are just great. The upper tray slides nicely and hasn't ever jumped it's tracks. While this wasn't a cheap tray, it does the job well and really solved a difficult storage problem. Highly recommend this product..."
5,incredible recordings to be treasured,"John Cerminaro is easily the most underrated horn player of his generation. These recordings are absolute gems and do a fantastic job of showcasing his intense artistry, virtuosic technique, and signature sound.Unfortunately, the recording quality of the Strauss is not the best. But every piece on this album is epic in intensity and brimming with the palpable anticipation of a live performance. This one is a must-have."
4,Talkin' Bout' Swamp Country!!!,"Both these movies are very fun and entertaining if you like these kind of B to C grade 70's fare. These are like exploitation light...for they are in no way soft core or very violent or profanity ridden. The short subject ""Swamp Virgin"" is actually better than either film. The whole package goes to together very very well!!"
3,Reprint of 'NFL: 75 Seasons' with updated 1990's chapter.,"If you don't own or haven't read 'NFL: 75 Seasons' printed in 1994 then you will enjoy this book. This book literally is 'NFL: 75 Seasons' with added text in the '90s chapter covering the period 1994-1998. This book highlights the NFL from it's birth to present day. The only qualm I have with the book is that *none* of the sidebar charts and lists showing records, super bowl champions, etc., were updated from the original printing of 'NFL: 75 Seasons'. Everything still ends in 1994. Had the editors updated these important sidebar items the book would have rated higher."
5,Most beautiful jasmine scent,This is very high quailty soap. It is french triple milled-which makes a very creamy lather and a nice hard bar of soap. It will last a long time and doesn't soften up and 'melt' as others do. But don't buy it because of that-buy it because it's the best damn smelling jasmine soap I've ever had the pleasure to sniff. ...
4,Good for you and fun too,These are so fun to make! There are a few ingrediants used in some of these you might not have laying around the house but they can easily be exchanged with something else.Overall a great bunch of good for you smoothies
2,Disappointed in the blender isle,"I purchased Dana Carpender's book 500 Low-Carb Recipes and was disappointed in the recipes and the ingredients. This book was no different. After reading the carb counts on her smoothies recipes as well as the ingredients she call for, they are not what I would consider low-carb."
3,Ronin is great; Young Savages is not convincing,"Ronin - Great film. Enough said.The Train is a good film. A bit dated, but still entertaining.The Young Savages expresses the ""it's society's fault"" thinking of the early sixties. Very dated, not convincing, and could have been alot better."
4,Intense!,"This video changed my perception of Bob. I was always on the fence, always liking him and digging his music but when I saw him doing ""It's alright ma (I'm only bleeding)"" on this video I finally ""got it"". An intense, tight and inspired performance. Tom and The Heartbreakers are perfect for the job as a back up band too. The duet with Bob and Tom singing ""Like A Rolling Stone"" is amazing. This is a must for any fan of popular music."
5,"A must for any true Dylan ""freak""! Buy it when you find it.","I have had this video for years....average watching it a couple of times a month...will be seeing him in Atlanta in September....my first grandchild will be born in November....the first song his mom, my oldest daughter, heard @ home was Dylan's ""Forever Young""( on original vinyl). She grew up hearing his music all her life...guess what my grandson's name is gonna be?"
1,Waste of time,"This has to be one of the most irritating books that I have ever read. The author spends an excrutiating amount of time going over trivial details. This book could be half of it's legnth if he didn't use this poor writing style.The material itself is very scant, and there are many better negotiating books available. If this is your first Negotiation book then it may be useful, however if you are a professional in the field or intend on gaining some new insights from this book you will be greatly disapointed. This problem is made worse by the fact that, the author constantly promises to introduce new tactics 'later' in the book - many of which he only spends a line or two on.In short, the author promises a great deal on the back cover and introduction, but fails to deliver on most of them. After reading this book, I felt like I wasted the last few hours. Now who do I negotiate with to get that time of my life back?"
3,Goes out with a fizzle...,"I am a HUGE fan of the quest for glory series, in fact I still play quest for glory I-IV. But quest for glory V was seriously lacking. It seemed to be tacked on and quickly thrown together. If your a fan on QfG get this just to fifnish the series but be prepared to be disapointed. The only thing improved would be the graphics. The plot and humor that made I-IV what they were just doesn't seem to be in QfG5. My adviice, buy the QfG anthology I-IV are defiantly better even if there are in VGA (and worse) graphics."
3,Not at all like the rest of Quest for Glory,"If you are a fan of the Quest for Glory series, you might want to buy this just to round out the collection. Fair warning though... if you loved Q4G for the fun and spoofs, they are strangely absent in this volume. For some reason Sierra dropped the spoofs and comedy to make a King's Quest clone instead of a spoof.The play is pretty smooth but the interface will drive you nuts until you get used to it."
2,What happened to the Quest for Glory series?,"Quest for Glory V: Dragon Fire is one of the most cold and heartless games even Sierra has managed to produce. The game doesn't even attempt to maintain the barest vestiges of a connection to the earlier--and much better--games in the series. It pays lip service to certain characters that appeared in other games, but has no real regard as to whether the inclusion of those characters is truly appropriate or not. In what was once an incredible series with all the promise in the world, Quest for Glory V has dropped and demonstrated--through its graphics, sound, and production, but absolutely nothing else--why no one should bother with games beyond the first two in the series."
5,Worth Buying...,"Throughout the years, I have played all the Quest for Glory games and really enjoyed them. This latest one, Dragon Fire, is just as good if not better than the earlier releases. According to today's technology, the graphics are a little cartoony, but it is still a wonderful adventure game. So many times you get games with excellent graphics, but rotten storylines. This isn't the case here. You get to customize your character and the neat thing is, your actions determine what happens to you. You can play the game over several times and not experience the same things. It is also neat that characters from past games appear throughout your journey, but it doesn't affect your gaming experience if you've never played the Quest series. I think these days you can find Dragon Fire in bargain bins, and of course here on Amazon, and it is well-worth spending a few dollars on."
1,completely useless,"I installed it on 4 different computers. The advertising material claims that it writes to both the DVD-RW and DVD+RW (as well as CD) formats, but Windows (as well as the sticker on the back of the unit) insists that it's compatible only with CD/DVD-.The incompatibility issue ultimately didn't matter to me, because it didn't write to or read from ANY format on ANY of the 4 computers. It also caused problems with pre-existing CD/CVD drives.Garbage."
2,For non-golfers,"Provides the golfing novice with the history/background of the Ryder Cup, but not much else. Lacked emotion and not very well written."
2,Suitable for non-golfers.,"Unfortunately for this book it has to stand against previous works by John Feinstein and Tim Rosaforte about the Ryder Cup. It fails to pick up the excitement and intimacy that ""A Good Walk Spoiled,"" and ""Heartbreak Hill"" have by a good margin. Its a decent pedestrian walk through Ryder Cup history for the non-golfer, but if you've read Feinstein or Rosaforte, give it a pass."
2,Only if you are new to the Ryder Cup.,"Since I'm an avid golfer, reader, and long-time fan of the Ryder Cup you might be able to appreciate my enthusiasm when I first came across this book. However, it's poorly written, edited, and boring. It may be worthwhile if you are totally unfamiliar with the Ryder Cup."
5,Girls Like It Too!,"I picked up this book while staying at a friend's house, and I was hooked! (No pun intended.) I had no idea what the Ryder Cup was, and am not a huge golf fanatic, but the history of the game, the way in which even the best players compete -- not for a lot of money, but simply for the sport of it -- made this an exciting read. I would highly recommend this, not only for the golfer in your family, but as a really interesting way of becoming acquainted with one of the oldest and most international ""gentlemanly"" competitions around."
5,the definitive work,"This is a great book about golf's best event. It reads with humor, drama and a wonderful command of the facts and history of this most unique and compelling competition. Bubka and Clavin have captured the history and spirit of the Ryder Cup by talking to those who were there, both past and present, and packing the volume with the sort of records and facts that will compel readers to keep this book handy for years to come, both to re-read before the next match, and to peruse in spare moments. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,Great Proudct!!!,I love this card! I love being able to take more pictures without having to upload to a computer. I would recommend this card to anyone that is looking to increase their memory card size. Kingston makes their products right! I support them fully!
5,Excellent deal,"An inexpensive and reliable way to save all your important files and documents...I use this mostly for my digital camera and, depending on the quality of picture I save, this little card can hold between 600 to over 1,000 pictures at a time. I never have to worry about running out of space while taking pictures on vacation. It is also useful to save or transfer files from your computer."
4,Great product,"For the price, this product works well. Read and write fast enough. I have it in my 5MP camera and it is wotking fine."
4,I RECOMEND,"this Kingston Flash Card memory is very versatil since you take it where you want, You have a fast access to your data mp3 and photos.I use it with my camara, my pocket pc and i can carrie evrywhere in my pocket."
1,Defeated and no more Kingston's card,"After 327 MB images loaded in the 1GB card, it showed full. It's defeated product, and won't buy Kinston's card anymore. I'm going to throw away the card incase caused more troubles later. Never had any problems with SanDisk card and I should stay with it. You thought you saved money from Kinston but guess it's not always."
3,Kingston 1GB SD flash card,"Have only had it a month, and it hasn't failed or caused any problems. Not much else to say. Wish Amazon would ask for reviews of things like this after a year, when more history was known."
1,Poor performance on 1GB SD,"Wanted to back up my GPS maps which on 1GB SD card with the Kingston version, however unable to load last few files, so it does not take the 1GB as advertised."
4,kinsgton SD card,"That card works like similar SD card from other brands, but acceptable price is big plus. Good product"
4,New Vista OS,There is a new thing in MS Vista OS where you can add memory to your PC via memory cards (assueming you have the proper slots) so i added 1G cheap and it runs just a bit faster...
5,Great bargin,"I bought this to go in the camera I purchased for my young grandson. Since we are not really ""techies"" this should do the job perfectly fine!!! It's a bargin for sure! I have never had any problems with the Kingston brand."
3,"Good price, but slow","These were a really good deal, but in comparison to other SD cards I have used they are slow."
3,Must be refomatted from FAT to FAT32 format,"Not bad for the money. However, the cards come FAT formatted. If you need to add over 350 files/pictures, the card needs to formatted in the FAT32 format"
4,"it's a memory stick, it works... that is all","what else do you need to know? it works, it was on sale, I bought one"
3,"Works good, no problems.","Didn't have any problems with this chip, transfer rate was reasonable, and the price was right."
5,Works well. Excellent Amazon customer service!,"My initial shipment of this card was defective and I was obtaining a lot of errors reading the data on it. I submitted an exchange request to Amazon and they promptly provided me return shipping back to them of the defective item and at the same time shipped me a new replacement. I now have no issues with the replacement card and it works well. More importantly, it was a pleasure doing business with Amazon knowing that I'm protected as a consumer by a company that treats customers right."
2,Slow Write Time,"The write time for this card is very slow. I have another canon with a different card manufacturer and its much faster. Beware of the cheap SD cards, you will pay for it in the end."
5,Just what my camera needed,"Why pay more? Ordered this to go with HP Photosmart camera, which will only store 10 pictures in internal memory. Popped the new card in and camera now says it can store 1,100 more. Kingston makes a dependable product; no need to pay for a name brand that has the same great quality."
4,Good value.,"I have this SD card for more than 6 months now, and am still using it. It is pretty reliable so far. I have reformatted it several times already and it's still going strong, even though it is one of the cheapest SD card on sale. Good value and good price."
4,Works fine,Works fine with my Nikon Coolpix camera as well as my Garmin Street pilot C550 nagivation device. No problems so far.
1,wrong product,I did not receive what I ordered. They send a different size which does not work in my camera.They did not have the item I ordered! They were willing to refund my money. I sold the cards to a friend. I still have not been able to buy 1 GB memory cards! It took 17 days to receive the order. I will not order from them again.
5,Amazing,1 GB for less than 20 bucks? How can you go wrong?Works great in both my Kodak and Canon digitals. Pop it right into my HP laptop's SD media slot and it uploads pics automatically.
5,Can remember a better memory card,"Like a battery, your memory card should:1. Last2. Not be seen3. Not give complaints.This is the reason I purchased this card and have no regrets."
5,"Works fine, great for the price.","Works fine, great for the price. Don't see why you'd need to spend more. Works great in my digital camera and has worked in other products as well."
5,"Kingston, the brand (as I've said before)","Yup, reliable as per usual with Kingston.Dont know what else to say...Works well in both cameras i've tried it in, and in my card reader...."
4,Just in time but good deal,"this product showed up on the very last day shipping was promised and everything else I have bought from amazon has been earlier than promised or in the first day or two, but I've been having tons of fun with it and its sooooooo much easier to fill one of these cards then to have to switch between lower mb cards and then try to remember which picture are on which card. so I love having the 1GB next will be the 2GB just so I can take longer and more videos ;-)"
5,It's a memory card. What else can I say.,"It works great in my Palm Treo. It stores photos, varios dictionaries and several translations of the Holy Bible with reference materials. It still has several hundred meg's free!"
4,Read the book in one night...,"Of course it took all night and I called in sick the next day.It was terrific. A refreshingly scientific approach --by a real scientist no less -- to the big ""What if?"" without requiring the reader to have a desk reference handy. Pickover manages to get the point across in a logical yet entertaining style that should keep most people glued to the pages. Sure, he makes a couple of leaps, but hey, we're talking about ALIENS.This was my first exposure to Pickover. It will definately not be my last.If you like the subject matter but are tired of all the self-published kooks out there then this is your book."
5,Woderful :),"I thouroughly enjoyed this book. The author seems to know what he is talking about, though some things in it are a bit fantastic. All in all it was a good book. I hope to hear more on this subject though from other authors in the near future."
3,fair,I think these bulbs are a fair price for what they are. They do shine a purplish tint but they are not very bright in my 94 honda civic. I like them a lot but probably be changing them out soon.
3,Parts are very good,"but parts are tedious. He makes some good points and the writing is rather entertaining in parts, but as a whole it seems to keep bogging down and becomes a difficult read. It starts with his early life which is rather fun to read but progresses to a series of lectures on the relationship between reality and theology. Although some of his points are good, others seem to get lost on tangents. I am glad I read it, but doubt I will pick it up again or recommend it to a friend."
2,T50 is not correct,I bought this set specifically for the T50 socket. My brake caliper uses T50 mounting bolts and I didn't have any torx sockets at all so I thought this would be a good deal. The T50 socket is not the correct size. I bought a T50 socket from the local auto parts store and it does the trick. All in all I am going to keep the rest of the sockets in case the error was with the specific socket and not the set in general. Judging by the lack of other complaints of the same issue I am going to guess this is isolated. I will update this review when/if I use the other sockets to tell you how the rest match up.
3,quality product?,"item came in a case that does not exude quality. i really cannot tell right now if the items will last. as we all know there are cheap and the good tools, i just hope this is a good tool that will last"
5,prompt shipping and great value,received this about three days after ordering - great set of torx bits that I used immediately! These are the most common sizes so should fit 99% of my torx needs.
3,Could have been happier,"I bought this product for quick clean-ups - to use rather than dragging out and plugging in the vaccuum cleaner. It eventually does the job, but you often have to go over a piece of dirt many times to pick it up."
3,Carpet sweeper,"This is a replacement for one I had years ago. Unfortunately the quality is not as good as the handle comes in segments and is not as sturdy, the clip on brush cleaner does not stay clipped on and is easy to lose, and the pick up does not seem quite as good. I would probably not buy this brand again but might try out another brand."
3,"A great, but VERY SMALL sweeper","This manual carpet sweeper picks up hair and dust better than any I've ever had. HOWEVER, it is *very* small, so many more strokes are required to get the job done. I was surprised at the small size, and wish a larger model was available, but I'm glad I have this one."
5,Wonderful small sweeper,This is a tiny easy to handle floor and carpet sweeper. Does a great job. I like it more than the battery opearted sweepeers I have bought.
1,Don't buy this product!,"It's a totally useless piece of junk that picks up nothing on carpet - nothing! For $15 I guess you can't expect much, even from a name like Fuller. It isn't even worth returning."
4,Works beautifully....,"The only quibble I have is with the handle, which is a series of screw-in tubes. They loosen up and flex too easily, so I have to tighten them every time I sweep. If I get too enthusiastic, there's a significant bow."
4,NIFTY LITTLE SWEEPER,"This little guy (the sweeping box only measures 6""x9"", which should be included in the product description) is amazing. Even though I read all of the reviews, I was surprised by how small it is. After putting it right to work, the diminutive size and light weight is actually an asset. In moves easily around furniture legs and beneath chairs. I have hardwood floors with area rugs, tile and linoleum in my house. It does and excellent job on the rugs; and, much to my surprise, picked up dust off of the floors. Even though it isn't as wonderful at picking up bird seed as my Dyson, it works much better than my electric broom, which tends to spit out small, hard particles. For fast and easy clean-ups, this is my new go-to appliance. It will have paid for itself in no time- in time saved."
5,Electrostatic,"I had an old one of these that finally fell apart, so I ordered another. This carpet sweeper is more effective at getting up dog hair than a shop vac!"
2,No pets,A few problems with this little sweeper:1. Too tiny to be of real use.2. It has an aversion to pet hair and refuses to injest it.3. Handle is flimsy and is likely to collapse in all directions.4. Way over-priced for what one gets.
4,Nifty little carpet sweeper that does a good job,"I bought this carpet sweeper based on the reviews it got and I like it! Works great as a quick picker-upper on carpet or rugs. When I received the box I thought something must be missing due to the small size of the package. Turns out you just plug a couple of sections together and you're ready to go. Assembly took all of 15 seconds at most. Seller shipped quickly, packaged well, and a good deal. Downside to the sweeper is that it doesn't pick up crumbs from a hardwood floor, but then again, it's a carpet sweeper so not a big deal."
4,carpet sweeper surprise!,"very lightweight,easy to use...great on pet hair! Worked much better than others in the past...great for everyday use..easy to move from floor to floor and fits easily in closet."
4,LIKE!!!,"I like this sweeper...it picks up almost everything and it's not noisey like a vaccum cleaner can be, so you can clean up while the little ones are napping.When I said ""almost everything"" it's because I had a problem picking up tiny bugs like Ants(if you have any). For this reason I gave the sweeper a 4 star review. Overall it is great for quick easy clean ups and the sweeper was delivered really fast, no where near the expected delivery date!!"
2,Doesn't Work on Dog Toy Fluff,"I have two very destructive rat terriers who enjoy ripping their toys to shreds. The also like rolling around in dry grass and leaves, then coming in the house and rolling around on the rug. I ordered this carpet sweeper to supplement my daily vacuuming, and it worked fine on the grass and leaf bits, but it actually made the toy stuffing worse. It would get caught in the brush and then spread the fibers in a thinner coating all over the place. I had to return it. Sigh."
2,Disappointing and Small,"The head of this sweeper is smaller than any I have had in the past which meant I had to go over the floor almost twice as many times since it only picked up a few inches at a time. In addition to that, I had to really push down to get it to pick up anything on hard wood floors. It worked marginally on industrial carpet and not at all on a rug with a pile. Very limited use. I sent it back before I measured it, but I think it couldn't have been more than 7-8 inches in width. Amazon was very prompt with a full refund."
1,Stanley carpet sweeper fuller brush,"The sweeper is very small and take a lot of effort to to get anything of the carpet and when u do you have to keep emptying it !the compartment doesn't hold hardly anything ,if you don't empty the dirt comes back out. Not worth the money at all . No were near our grandmothers sweepers . I sent mine back!"
2,disapointed,"i have used non electric sweepers years ago this one is just so little, like make for kids to play house"
1,Carpet sweeper breakdown,"I bought the Electrostatic Carpet Sweeper from a Fuller Brush salesman about 5 years ago. We used it in the kitchen area and on some carpets with good results. However, the rubber covers on all four wheels split and fell apart in the last six months. I kept the sweeper inside, at room temperature, since buying it. It was not exposed to harsh chemicals.I contacted Fuller Bursh and they told me that since it was only guarenteed one year, they would not repair or replace it. I felt like I was buying quality and that they would stand behind their product. I expected better from Fuller Brush and have purchased my last product from them.I also followed up with an email, throught their website, and received no reply. Very poor customer relations!"
4,Love this Video!,"One of the cheesiest movies of all times. BUT I LOVE IT!!! If you like real characters and ballroom dancing, this movie should be part of your collection.DVD came in great condition and shipped earlier than expected. Overall, very satisfied with the service I received from Amazon."
3,why no Region A/1 release???,"5 stars for the movie. No stars for no Region A/1 release. Hopefully there will be Region A/1 release soon so I can upgrade the rating to match the movie,"
5,The best dance/romatic comedy EVER,"Wow...this movie is breathtaking...sure it might be a little kooky and over-the-top at times...but that's what makes it so great, loveable, funny, and re-watchable. The dancing is spectacular when it needs to be and highly sensual and romantic when the script calls for it.This is a movie that stirs up genuine emotions for me. The ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"" by Doris Day scene is simply inspired. The cast is fabulous...especially Paul Mercurio (lead character, Scott), as well has his love interest Fran (played by Tara Morice). I also give special note to Scott's mother, and his initial dance partner, Liz. The romance is impossibly sweet, and also very believable.Very funny...one of my all-time favourites. For people who like to escape and be taken on a fabulous journey when watching their movies :) This movie is pure HOTNESS."
5,Sexy and Sweet,"This has to be my all-time favorite movie! Paul Mercurio is really hot, in that Medeterranian sort of way, dark skin, dark hair, and those swiveling hips, yum. Well, the movie is so funny, and the way Fran, the ugly beginner, turns into be somewhat pretty is actually believable! I love it!"
5,My go-to feel-good movie,"Everybody has one! this is mine. ALWAYS makes me feel better. Lighthearted, loveable charicatures, delivers an improtant message: A life lived in fear is a life half-lived!"
4,You'll like this even if you don't like Ballroom Dancing,"Great retelling of the old, old Romeo and Juliet story. Australian films and actors just have a real charm about them. There is a lot of magic in this story, in the filming, and in the actors. Enjoy this!"
5,been wanting this movie,"Hubby saw this movie years ago, loved it, got me to watch it, liked it as well, so had to finally get it"
3,Some spectacular dance scenes,"I've never really been a great fan of Baz Luhrmann's. Moulin Rouge was also a 3 out of 5 rating, in my opinion. I think it must be his style of cinematography - its neither theatre nor film, its halfway in-between... but I'm like this : If I watch a film I want to see a film, and if I want to watch a musical, I go to the theatre. Still, I gave this a shot after reading lots of glimmering reviews about it here. What I can say is this : the dancing was spectacular, and I love dancing, so that was why I gave this movie 3 stars. Apart from that, its just a run-of-the-mill love story... The lush prop sets and costumes might be a main attraction for some who loved this film enough to give it 5 out of 5, but I tend to look for something original and a bit different in a movie, and this just wasn't it."
3,Just a warning,"NOT what I expected. The first few minutes left me feeling disjointed and confused with its rapid-paced asides to the audience, but it calms down a bit into general kookiness. A satire mocking the professional dancing profession, it presents sometimes shocking extremes. I agree with other reviewers about the charm, and certain scenes are undeniably stirring, but they are mixed in with some unsettling hooplah. This is actually not a movie I plan to go back to."
3,A life lived in fear is a life half lived,"At first glance, this movie is cheap idealistic shine, but it does have a deeper message. ""A life lived in fear is a life half lived"" is the films motto, and they advertise this at every opportunity.The motto refers especially to Scott, a young dancer who wishes to dance his own moves, but on closer examination, aslo refers to many other characters (Doug, Fran, and Barry Fife.)A must see if you liked cinderella, dirty dancing, or fame."
2,Good dancing,"I will say this movie had good dancing and at times was very sweet with the love story, but that's about it. I guess it's the cinamatography that I really don't like, the way it is filmed feels almost unprofessional.The acting is over the top at times and it seems like the people acting are forced and not natural. There is almost no back story to the whole plot, it barely touches on the past of this dance foundation or whatever it's called.This could have been much better. It was nice to watch once, but I don't need to see it again. I'd say rent it from your library."
2,Old and Lame,"I saw the number of stars and thought I had purchased a great movie, but I did not enjoy it because it was old and seemed second rate.Sorry!"
5,Well Worth the $ to Buy and Keep,"I owned this when it came out in VHS; time to upgrade and hopefully the new format will be viable for my kids, two and four years old, to watch and enjoy at some point in the future.I kid you not, I have no clue how many times I've watched this movie, I love it that much. Everytime I've seen it I come away with something different, find myself enchanted by the characters all over again, with their quirks, their humanity, their ""bigger-than-lifeness"", and who can't love a movie where the main character unravels and embraces the super-macho bullfighter's dance, the Paso Doble, with a freight train suddenly taking over the screen - how Freudian can you get?I cannot provide enough superlatives to attribute to this film, it's that good. Simple, sweet, lovely, and a sheer joy to watch. The dancing is wonderful - if you have a scintilla of appreciation for being able to move to music then watch this movie and wish you were Paul Mercurio."
4,Lesson in Oppression,"I watched this film for a graduate level class on dysfunctional/oppressive relationships. The character development is excellent as are the role structures of the characters. The film has a good plot, denouement and finish. I would recommend this film for those interested in a good story about rising from oppression from the judgement of others (including family and community). Kinda has a ""B"" feel to it, but it is a good movie!"
5,Cinderella and Cinderfella,"What a WONDERFUL, funny, movie with a profound message about being vulnerable and willing to take chances. Scott takes a chance on new dance steps. Fran takes a chance on being rejected. Dad takes a chance to ""bend yer ear for a tic."" What is SO liberating is how each character grows from their willingness to take a chance and how even the weak characters, terrified of change, find themselves redeemed and enlarged--beginning principally with Fran's courage enabling Scott to stop being a ""selfish"" dancer. I watch this movie at least 2 or 3 times a year. ""A life lived in fear is a life half lived."""
4,Very Funny!,"If you like dry satire and are a fan of Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, don't let the title scare you off. I love how colorful and fun the movie is in addition to the humor and music."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Both a sweet little movie in its own right and a sly, tongue-in-cheek play on formulaic dance movies/ugly duckling pictures, Strictly Ballroom is an amusing and entertaining romp that will win over even the more hardened cynics--it did me, after all."
5,Fabulous flic!,"This is not your average ""dancing"" or ""Cinderella"" chick flic. The characters are finely drawn and the dancing complements the story line. I saw the movie by chance - didn't have anything better to do - and rushed to purchase my own copy ASAP. Highly recommended!"
4,Just for fun,I only had the videotape and now also the DVD. I had to change the regioncode of my DVD player and I did watch the movie again. It was nice to see it again.
4,One of the best movis I have seen in a long time.,It had all the right stuff just like Dirty Danceing. Paul Mercuruo is so fine he makes you want to get up and dance.
4,Gift for someone,This was a gift purchase. I do know she loves the movie and watches it over and over!!
4,Before Dancing With the Stars,This is a great movie with some wonderful dancing. It was early in the career for Baz but definatly has his trademark movie making style.
3,Those Blasted Ballroom Dancing Rules!,"Here's a different kind of story: mocking the ultra-seriousness of ballroom dancing, at least among people in Australia, where the film was made. The strict rules, perhaps, are mocked as much as the people involved.Once again, it's the clichéd story of a rebel who is the good guy and the establishment who are the bad people. (Will filmmakers ever get themselves out of the 1960s?)Add some stupid humor, a very annoying lead woman (the mother of the star dancer), and a predictable storyline and you have another overrated critics' favorite, although it's still worth a rental. The good parts of the film are the colorful dancers and general cinematography. The dancing is excellent, too. For all the latter, I give it three stars."
5,"I've got my happy face on today, Les!","One of the most egregious and unforgiveable DVD absences is set right at long last. There are no tech details listed yet, so I can only hope the studio intends to handle this release like the jewel it should be -- including background on the original stage production and giving the film itself the full-tilt digital treatment.If you're a 'Moulin Rouge' fan who's not yet experienced the gleefully malfeasant, candy-colored universe of the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Amateur Championships, you're in for a fabulous treat. If, like me, you've been anticipating this DVD release above many others, go us!! No, it's not cinematic rocket science or brain surgery or even really a gourmet meal, but from the opening 'documentary' to the final steps, unless your curmudgeon status is chronic and immutable, it's simply not possible to maintain a bad mood while viewing. For a movie like this, that's all you really need to know."
5,One of my favorite movies.,"For anyone who likes ""Dancing with the Stars"", this movie is a serious but romantic look at the world of competitive dancing. If you think politics have a lot to do with the outcome of the television show, you have not seen anything to compare with what actually occurs during these competitions. The dancing and story line are just super! I think that anyone would LOVE this movie."
4,Enjoyment,"When I realized this was the movie that I had seen some few years ago, I had to have it. It arrived in great fashion and it was just as enjoyable as the first time that I had watched it with my little sister. I am glad that I was able to find it and would certainly look for others in the same genre."
5,great shoes,"They're unbelievably comfortable, especially compared to the leather top-siders. I've gotten a lot of complements with the white shoes. I'll definitely buy these again."
4,interesting,"I got this book from the library and I am not sure, if I am going to buy it. These project are not to my taste at all, but the author does show some interesting techniques that I was not familiar with. The faux tortoise shell pattern does not look like tortoise at all, but it is an interesting and attractive pattern that I would consider using for various projects. Her Mokume Gane construction is the simplest I have seen so far. The faux faberge pill box is one of her more attractive ideas and this is the first time I have seen embossing powder used as an enamel-like glaze. All in all, as with her other book ""Polymer Clay Extravaganza"", I was intrigued with the techniques, but not really interested in any of the the projects she presented. Some items were pretty good, just not my style - others were simply cheap and cheesy looking."
1,Not Recommended - Beware of Hard Seams,"Terrible design. I purchased these and paid $23 rush ship for them. They looked great from description and pictures. However, in reality they are constructed of several panels of very thick fluffy stuffed material each sewn together with a very tough stitching. I have soft, ulcer prone tissue on my heel back. There are seams running down the center of the foot and up the middle of the heel through the achilles. So, despite all the padding the heavy stitching presses sharply into my delicate skin. Cannot use these and will be returning. Too bad because if they'd use wider cloth panels and had thought intelligently about where to place stitching would be a very useful product. Extremely disappointing."
4,Both for class teaching and self-study,"This book provides good insight into how L1, L2, etc. are learned. It might benefit from more in the way of case studies. It's however a very good book, useful for class teaching and also self-study."
3,Review,The book is good but somebody who is specializing in Linguistics will additional textbook with this book. Not all languages equal in terms of learning as a second language. There are hypothesis that Professors who have lived and taught in third world countries will disagree with.
3,No title,"It would have been nice if the seller would have informed the buyer (in this case, me!) that it was marked with highlighting and underlining. Definitely wasn't in as great of shape as stated."
1,late item,i did not recive this book unile now after two monthes i'll never never pay another thing from this place.
4,Book for ELL Class,This book is easy to read and has a lot of important details about the process of language acquisition. The book gives great detail about theories of language acquisition without influencing your opinion.
4,Great introduction,"This is not meant to be a definitive work or Language acquisition research, but as other pieces of work in this series, serves as a great and clear introduction to some of the mos important topics for language educators.I consider this book, together with ""Explaining English Grammar"" by George Yule from the same collection, ""The English Verb"" by Michael Lewis and ""The Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English"" essential materials for any TESOL."
4,"Strong, stylised classic","Gavin Bishop, pre-eminent New Zealand illustrator, gives a strong portrayal of Maui, the trickster archetype in a legendary battle to order the universe. A story from the well-spring of Maori myth this is a book to treasure within a family library and as part of a comprehension collection of heroic tales in public libraries. Tama Nui te Ra, the sun, is personified in the tale and the illustrative style is an inspiration to teachers and students of the language arts."
4,"Absorbing, makes you think.","Similar to the film ""Agnes of God"", but a more satisfying plot and character motivation. Critical of Roman Catholicism, particularly among the lower class, and of the Church's tendency to close ranks when nuns and priests commit crimes. Was the nun in question ""sane""? Is the Church above the law? Should punishment of the religious be left to the internal affairs section of the Roman Catholic Church? The reader must decide."
1,Won't play even pristine discs without skips or lock-ups.,Total Jucking Funk. I've suffered through this player for almost a year; it's getting noticeably worse as the time drags on.Brand new discs without visible flaws won't play without lock-ups; I'm sick of this player and can hardly wait to get a different one.My biggest concern is getting one that's actually BETTER. I'm scared they're all this bad.Yamaha--like Sony--USED to be a good brand name that deserved some respect. Both companies now seem to churn out Communist Chinese GARBAGE that barely functions.
2,Good for more practice but some irritating flaws,"I've used many Schaum's books before, and most of them were very good because they were well written and explained concepts and techniques clearly. ""Beginning Linear Algebra,"" however, was not as good as most of the other books in the series. It suffers from long chapter outlines, poor explanations, and many errors both in the explanations and answers to problems. Nevertheless, this book does provide a lot of good practice problems with answers. So I would recommend this book as a supplement to a regular text and not as a primary source of information about linear algebra."
1,What a ...!!,I bought this cd hoping to listen again the fabulous album issued by Magnet Records many years ago. But I only found seven songs and only the title track is the only link to that old long play. Maybe one day I will find the original cd...maybe!
1,Buy the the Original,"You can now buy the original on CD reference Raucous RecordsRef RAUCD 081. Happy listening. I was an original groupie of Matchbox in the late seventies, Graham Fenton attended my wedding and was nearly my brother in law. Buy it, I might as I no longer have the vinyl."
4,A fun read,"If you pick up this book expecting a history of the War of the Triple Alliance (Paraguayan War), you will be disappointed. If you want to spend a few evenings with an entertaining, opinionated companion regaling you with his tales of exotic travel, you can hardly do better than Sir Richard Burton. This is Victorian travel writing at the hands of the master. Amusing, erudite and filled with English prejudice."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,Dayle Hinman has zero charisma and is a horrible screen presence. The investigative work is almost nil and the episodes are dull and void of suspense.
1,jaw set,You don't get what is in the picture only 4 jaws. The jaws are worthless without the rest of it. Tried to get the rest of it but no luck.
2,"Very good testor, however the testing leads are very cheap","The tester works good is an reliably accurate however, the testing leads are the cheapest ever, after some use the ends will fall off the wires."
4,Great for Middle School Math Class,I use this book to introduce proportional reasoning. I've created activities that extend the ideas. Great book...even for older kids.
5,Nice plush loon with realistic sound,I've given this loon as a gift before and met with good results. I know my friends will enjoy them this year and be reminded of these wonderful birds.
1,Very disappointing item.,"This was a VERY disappointing item. I have a similar item and was so happy to fine this on line. However upon receiving it, the quality is far, far substandard to the one I already have. The call only works some time and when it does work, it is so soft you have to hold it up to your ear to hear anything. I would not recomend this item to anyone!"
5,AWESOME!~,"The little loon is awesome. Has great sounds and looks amazingly lifelike. Bought as a gag gift for my son, he was chased by a loon on a lake. He cracked up laughing and loves it."
5,A Great Addition to the Series!,"Ever since this series started I was impressed with the message and the content that the show provided, as it encouraged kids to be active learners and this DVD was no different. While there was only one episode on this DVD, it followed a similar format to some of the shows that are on PBS, though it was extended (being 45 minutes long). I knew this going in so I was not surprised that there was not more on the DVD (though I would have loved more). The DVD itself was filled with some great music and I loved seeing the interaction between Sid and his Dad, as a positive relationship between father and son is always a good thing to see on television. All-in-all I was impressed with the DVD and will say that anyone that loves Sid the Science Kid will enjoy this. If you have never seen this series, you should as it teaches kids so much about the world around them, but also about friendship, self-esteem and individuality."
1,Only ONE episode!,"This is a show, but the DVD is only one episode. Even $5 is too much for one episode. Thanks"
3,only one episode,"this DVD only has one episode, nice one but not enough. I like the other ones that have more than one."
2,Not much Beck...,"There is not much actual Beck on this cd. About every 5 or 10 mintues there is a one or two sentence quote from Beck, the rest is mostly a narrator telling Beck's history. Some facts are wrong."
4,Good book.,This book was hard to put down. I found myself at my subway stop before I knew it. I look forward to the next book by this author.
2,Not for beginners,"I wish Suhaila had explained the various movements in more detail for those of us that can't just look at a dancer and follow what she's doing. She uses terms like ""releve""(?) and ""grapevine"" and I have no idea what she is talking about. I love dancing but I've never taken a dance class, so I need more help picking up steps than this video provides.I wouldn't recommend this tape for bellydancing novices like myself."
2,belly dance DVD,"This DVD is okay. Not what I expected but at least it loaded and played without freezing, skipping, etc. It had some steps that didn't seem to be for beginners. A little faster than I would have liked."
3,Bellydance for beginners,"I like the moves that Suhaila has and shows but this is not for beginners. I had a tough time keeping up and knowing what she was talking about. A little slower and less intense to begin with would have been nice. Oh, and explain the moves."
2,disappointed...,"I like excercising with DVD regularly. I tried many DVDs - aerobics, yoga, jazzercise, stretching, etc. I learned a lot from each one of them and I've never had any problem to follow cues and instructions. Unfortunately, this DVD was not for me. Like another viewer pointed out, Suhaila does not explain the routine movement clearly so that Bellydance beginners can understand. Every movement goes too fast, I can barely catch up. Plus, sorry to say this, but instructors are not very attractive. This DVD did not inspire me."
3,NOT ONE OF MR. CHRISTIANSEN'S BEST,"Having read about a half dozen of the author's usually fine & practical books,I have to say there's far too much ""New Age"" & ""Ying Yang"" nonsense for my liking in this one. In fairness,it does improve after the first chapter or two,but compared to either of his FIGHTER'S FACT BOOK(s),it leaves a feeling of disappointment."
2,nice effort,I can only say that the effort was obvious but the information was hard to use.The research was solid but lacked common usage for slugs like me.
2,Worst from the best,I have all four of Lurrie Bell's Delmark recordings and this is my least favorite.Try Blues had a baby or Sweet kiss of the blues and you won't be disappointed.
5,Surprised how good this is . . .,"Just caught a bit of Lurrie Bell on a blues radio show the other night, and was intrigued enough to buy this disk. Great, great stuff. Bell's guitar work is awesome and he's got a haunting, hypnotic singing voice. Steve Cushing's songwriting is just great also - who knew? Just a great listen all around."
3,"Great for big pieces of meat, not so much for anything else","This is a simple no nonsense thermometer for big pieces of meat like a turkey, a whole chicken or a big roast. It doesn't work very well for steak or anything thin. It's also best to ignore the temperature suggestions since they are way too high. A rare steak at 140 degrees? Try about 20 degrees cooler."
1,Not dishwasher safe,"I only bought this one because the description says dishwasher safe, but the packaging clearly states do not immerse in water and do not put in dishwasher."
3,GrammaJules,"It works, but the little arrow that moves kind of rusted up from the dishwasher and there was fog on the inside after that too."
2,Rarely to Steven King stories get well adapted to the screen,"For some reasons, very few Steven King stories get well translated to the screen.The BEST is probably SHAWSHANk REDEMPTION by farGreat movie !!!But almost every other King story that gets turned into a movie (including this one) simply fail.Could not make it to the end.Just did not hold our attention at all."
1,"A waste of talent and of my time, I thought.","The movie holds your interest up to a point, but after watching it to the very end, I felt that I hadjust wasted my time. At the end of the film, it's watching a so-so actor together with Christian Slater, who hams it up, and overacts. Slater is talented, butthis was a waste of his talent. Maybe it was just a case of bad direction. I thought the story was paper thin, and the acting also thin and unimpressive, all the way through, with clichés.Showing the wife now and then, the way the director did, was a tired cliché,I thought. I wouldn't recommend this filmto anybody. I do like Christian Slater, when the material is good."
5,True Steven King,"I thought twice about checking out this movie, but so glad that I did. Slater plays a rather narcissistic slave trader with an invincable fortress in the form of a custom built Caddilac SUV. Bullet proof and loaded with electronics he's always safe in it.When a school teacher on horseback sees him murder some truck drivers for damaging his ""product"", she decides to testify against him. After her obvious demise, her husband ""another teacher"", has to devise a way to get his revenge. Story line is great, odd characters throughout the story adds to the entertainment and the ending keeps you wondering about the outcome to the last moment053803 Life at Fifteen."
2,Dolan's Cadillac [Blu-ray],I guess the film It's ok but when I bought this item they said it have spanish subtitles but It won't I felt desapoiment from this
3,What would I do for payback ?,"I love a good revenge flick and I think this one holds up pretty well. I love the fact that nothing comes easy for our boy Robinson (Wes Bentley) . Look at the trials and tribulations this dude go's through to avenge his poor brides demise. This is not really a spoiler as this can be figured out by looking at the DVD art. Robinson makes his way through the whole movie with this really ticked off look on his face and I can see why, not much is going his way. Christian Slater is at the top of his fast speaking smart alec game and spews out some top notch dialogue . I see Stephen King wrote the original story and this plays out like I think a Stephen King story would , but in a good way.It's all over the top and well worth your time. Side note to Christian Slater fans , this is the best thing our old buddy C.S. has done in a while, maybe there is still hope for him."
3,Sadistic teacher,"When an unwitting witness of a gangster brutality was exterminated, a husband-teacher of a horse-riding wife-in-expectancy murdered had taken justice in own hands and achieved goals even more brutally than these criminals did.A work belongs to movies where none is positive."
2,Goofy and ridiculous,"Christian Slater's character was a bit much to watch. He had Robinson's (Wes Bentley) wife Elizabeth, assassinated before she could testify witnessing him killing some ""coyote's."" Way over the top and exaggerated performance by Slater as Jimmy Dolan - a trafficker of women in the sex trade. I was glad when Wes Bentley's character finally buried him alive (on a highway) at the end. The scenes leading up to Slater's demise were the only good parts of the movie. Robinson really tortures Dolan psychologically before finishing him off."
3,where's the math?,"I'm studying out of this book for my intermediate micro course. Simply put, the text is good (but unremarkable) for what it is: a no-nonsense bridge between the usual undergraduate principles course and graduate course in microeconomic theory. However, I can't help but feel that Frank skims off too much math in the name of accessibility. This won't help the reader looking to go further in the subject, i.e., grad or b-school. This would be okay if the appendices packed the math, but this isn't the case: the appendices are on-line at the publisher's web site, which pretty much means if you want to follow the math, you need to be near a computer. A somewhat ""mathier"" text, that I highly recommend, is the latest edition of Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics."
4,Learn Japanese Cooking with Detail Instructions,"I took cooking course when I was in high school and I like this book because it is easy to follow. I also have the related training in college since some of my courses are Fermentation Engineering are related with Food Engineering.First, the author introduced a list of Japanese Ingredients, which are the different raw materials that to be used in Japanese cooking.For these materials, he shows a photo of them. He also tells you how to find them. He even suggested several brands for the rice.Second, Clear writing. For each menu, there are four photos to show different steps and all the raw materials you need. For each entree, there is a suggestion for how many eaters to serve.Third, this book covers dessert, soup, entree, sushi, rice balls, etc. After reading this book, I made a three-courses dinner without much difficulties."
3,"Pro-S Reid Brown, DJ V.i.P. Better Than Yours Productions",The Pro-S is an ok Catridge. Any cartridge with a built in headshell is going to require alot of weight to be able to stay in the groove such as the Pro-S. I tried these carriages and sent them back because they didn't have the wight I needed to pull of explosive scratching.
3,"First one died, second one great","It worked well for a bit, but now I get ""Memeory Card Error"" messages. Amazon has been great in exchanging it though. I may have just gotten a bad one.UPDATE: I've had the new one for 6 months now, and it works great! I'd be at 5 stars if not for the prob with the first one, but it won't let me change it to 4 now."
1,Off-brand is unreliable. Do not risk losing your digital pictures.,"When shopping for a larger memory card for my digital camera, I thought all SD cards were created equally. So, I chose this cheaper product from a off-brand manufacturer. The money I saved sure wasn't worth the 100's of pictures I lost when this card failed. Of course, the card had to fail on vacation, after we had taken many pictures. It was less than 2 weeks old when it failed, so I didn't even get much use out of it at all. I promptly returned it to Amazon when I got back from my vacation, but that won't replace my missing pictures. Don't take a chance with your memories because you want to save a few dollars. It isn't worth it."
4,Kingston 512MB Elite Pro Secure Digital Memory Card,"Works well with my Navigation system, I have not had any problem with it."
3,Wait till it gets cheaper,Ok first off as some other people said it has very akward controls. Second the online multiplayer is terrible no matter how much memory you have. And third is that it just didnt live up to what it was supposed to be. It wasnt an absolute failure but it wasnt great. It has some awesome weapons and the numbers and amimatronic stuff when you enter a level is pretty cool. So unless you absolutely need a shooter on the psp get this but there are some better ones out there. I say wait until the price goes down then the game will be worth every penny.
3,An encouraging first try,"First off, I think this is definetly a rental, not a buy. I liked this game. Didn't love it, liked it. Evertones complaints are valid; repetetive, awkward controls, lcak of animation. I rented this knowing the controls would be awkward because its a handhels, but after a while I got good at it. I also rented it to see what a fps on the small screen was like. I was prepared to be dissapointed, but I was very pleased. I was pleased that this, being the first fps on the psp, was a pretty good first try, and as game developers go along, the fps on psp is only going to get better."
2,not a really good game,"a decent 1stps, it only needs a few tweaks to make it better if they decide to make a similar game. The graphics a really good for a psp game, but it is really repetitive and you arent really doing different thing besides boss things. it would be cooler if it had a mode where you can have a deathmatch w/o having any people over. the psp is still a baby and isn't really recognized by the people like the consoles or the gba, but the games will get better like this one should of been"
4,"Good and Fun, but Repetitive","The basic plot of this game is to blast away anything and everything in sight. If you like this concept, buy the game. However I feel that it lacks certain elements such as a basic story line (which bothers me since there is not a single cut scene in the entire game), and even though it claims that the environments change every time you play, they all seem like big rooms connected by hallways with a few elevators here and there. There are a lot of weapons but several look exactly the same (such as Inferno, Judgement, and Onslaught which all have different attributes, but look like RPG launcher.) Final Verdict: In more ways than one this game is very repetitive, but if you like blowing away through clips of ammo like never before on a hand held, this game is worth every penny."
4,Good Game,"This game is really good,if u like FPS games u will like this one. The controls take some time to get used to. The main part of this game is really short u could beat it in a day or two. But there is a mode that u unlock that goes on forever. This game is really hard too, and if u dont like restarting the level over and over again this game isnt for u."
1,Coded Arms,"this is a fun game and all, but it did not come with the manual or even cd case(which i would think it should state that. just thrown in a paper envelope. such poor care and poor respect"
1,Rotten FPS,Buy this only if you're crazy for FPS gameplay and can't live without it for PSP. Awkward controls (no matter how they're configured) and difficult but incredibly repetative game play make this a loser. Wait for Doom or another well-done game.
2,disappointing....,"this is NOT a guitarist's record. it's got a lot of acoustic oriented tunes, plus jeff sings on a couple of them. let's put it this way, eddie van halen sang on a track on the last VH record, and if you've heard that, you understand why guitarists get vocalists!!seriously, i am a big jeff fan, he is a great player, and a good writer...i just don't recommend this if you're looking for some guitar fire, there's barely a spark on this."
1,Do NOT buy for International Use,I bought this item for international use and it sucked. It sucked in Germany. It sucked in Italy. It sucked in Austria. It sucked on wireless line. It sucked on DSL. It sucked on wire connection.
4,Nice and handy,"Nice and handy. I took this India when I was travelling and could make calls to US from whereever there is a machine with USB port and broadband internet connectivity. Its very easy to use - just plug and play. Only thing you need to ensure is if there are any proxies blocking the required ports. I found that issue only once (Internet Service Provider specific issue), but usually it is not the case."
2,Decent phone service - terrible customer service,"The service itself works well. However, in order to get you to sign up, they will tell you anything and make any promise it takes. When it comes time to deliver, they deny ever claiming the service has that particular feature or they inform you that the feature is extra. Their terrible customer service destroys any value their product has."
2,Too big.,"I have a Garmin Edge 705 and this is the only case that Garmin lists for it. You could easily fit four Edge 705's in it, maybe more. It's too short to hold the HRM strap without sharply bending the sensor part (probably not a good idea). I don't see how this case is a good idea. I can throw a number of other random things in there but this is really not what I was looking for in a case for my 705."
3,Nothing Special Nothing Bad,This is about what I expected based on the reviews. It's nothing special but it does what I need it to do. I did have my Edge 705 get turned on somehow while in the case and I typically careful about closing it and making sure it's not hitting anything else. I wish there was a better way to secure the actual GPS in this. What would be great would be a case that has a molded foam that the GPS could sit in and that had specific compartments for the other items. I'm thinking this cost about $2 to manufacture so the $25 + that most pay is hard to swallow.
4,garmin gps carrying case review,Case is sturdy enough to protect the contents and there's plenty of room for the garmin forerunner 305 and chest strap. Too bad you have to store the chest strap with the ends curled over; otherwise the case would have to be several inches longer.
3,cautionCAUTIONcaution,"I bought this to carry my Garmin Forerunner 305 (the BEST) I give it 5 ***** for carrying the watch, the usb cord, the wall connection..... but DO NOT PUT YOUR HEART RATE strap in this case. It took a day or two for my strap to function properly. 0 * for HRM strap carrying Average 3 (actually 2 1/2)"
5,Perfect,"When I first received this in the mail, I thought it was a little bulky for what I needed. I quickly learned that it holes everything I need to bring with me without having to carry anything in my hand. It's the perfect carryalong pouch that holds small items you will need."
2,Overpriced considering the alternatives,"This contains two fantastic documentaries that profile the two best teams in Denver Broncos history. The content is great and the production is top notch.That said, considering that you can purchase these through video download services for $2 for each season ($4 total) makes this quite a bit overpriced. It's interesting that these two programs cost more at Amazon.com than the 3 greatest games set for the Denver Broncos.Great product, poor price."
2,Did You Declare the Corpse?,"This is not the author's best work. It plods on and on, this way and that way. The characters seem to overlap and get confused. Two couples especially get confused with each other at times. Then, as it races to conclude, some characters change identity."
2,Disappointing and Tedious,"I truly enjoy this series but this effort was boring and tedious. It took effort to convince myself to finish the book. It drives me crazy when plots end up in loose ends that are not only never discussed again but are ignored at the denoument. Hopefully, the series will get back on track...""Bless her heart""."
5,Intelligently Written and Satisfying Cozy Mystery Series!,"I really enjoy this series and also Patricia Sprinkle's genealogical series, so much so that I have found them all in large=print for my older sister in Florida. Read my full review of her book ""Guess Who's Coming to Die"" for more information. That review applies to all the books in this down-home Georgia series."
2,dull,"This is a mystery that starts at one time, then jumps back to the past. It's a technique that can work--but only if you give the reader a reason to care, to wonder how and why the character(s) got into the predicament you first see them in.In this case, it begins with a mystery about coffins delivered to the wrong chapel that nobody apparently ordered, and a body found in one of them, but we don't know who.Then it jumps back in time to tell us all the details of a tour to Scotland, complete with accents: a Canadian woman who ends every statement with ""eh?"" and the Scottish characters all find reason to say ""fit ye deein'"" at least once in every conversation.The tour is dull, the characters unlikeable, crimes that are eventually uncovered are just ignored at the end, and the mystery that starts the book, the coffins being delivered to the wrong chapel, is solved, but makes no sense."
1,Picture,"The image shows the ligature and the cap. I did not pay attention to that. The ligature was the most important item, but I ended up purchasing only the cap.Please change the image so it doesn't happen to anyone else!"
5,Equus 5568 Timing Light,"Great product! worked flawlessly right out of the box. Instructions are easy to understand and read. Recommend to anyone who works on cars, engines, etc. Dial in advance feature works great and makes timing much much easier."
2,Poor Customer Service,"The unit I received from Amazon had a defective Xenon light. After only 5 minutes on the phone, a tech support individual agreed it was defective and gave me a return authorization number and shipping instructions.I shipped the unit to Innova Electronics, Fountain Valley, CA on 8/1/2011. As of 8/26/2011 I'm still waiting for a replacement. The response to my email request for shipper and tracking information was, ""We use FedEx."" Period.I found out on my own that this item is back ordered on their web site. I don't mind waiting but would appreciate some customer service. My gut feeling is that I'm out of luck on this purchase.I'm sure this item is a treat to use. So long as it's not defective.Update: 9/10/2011. After 41 days, I received a replacement unit. Best of all, it works! I tested it on my 1967 VW bus with stock 1/4"" (6.35mm) plug wires and it worked fine."
3,Equus Timing Light?,"Greetings, I read one review here that says this light does not work well on the 8mm or 8.5mm wires. Well this is what I use, for wires, so before I buy is there more then one person who knows if this works with these 8 and 8.5MM wires? I tried several times to get a response from the Equus web sight but of course they never returned my email. And, the phone numbers are not working. Thanks friends. Mike"
3,Great Timing Light but....,"My wife purchased this Timing Light for me as a Christmas gift and it has some of the nicest features you could imagine. Only one problem though, it does not function with any vehicle that has an aftermarket MSD or Mallory ignition system installed. It functions sporadically when these type of ignition system are installed on your vehicle and the MSD website confirms this as well. Many timing lights have trouble reading the MSD's capacitive discharge multiple sparks. Dial back timing lights are not recommended either.Very disappointing that I must send back this full featured Timing Light because it simply does not work with MSD (Multiple Spark Discharge) ignition systems."
5,"Works Great & it is a ""Dial Back Timing Light""","It does not state it anywhere in the desciption on Amazon, but I figured it had to have this feature because it was a feature rich time light. On the C3 Corvette fouum all they talk about is a dial back timing light and how helpful they are setting up the vaccume and mechanical advance on older cars. After purchasing this light to replace the 50 year old timing light used by my day I must say I agree. The 5568 had no problem picking up the spark from the 8 mm plug wires I am using like some others stated, the manual says ti works up to 10 mm."
1,Racist Humor Lives,"If you like racist humor and have no regard for what is right or wrong, and have interest in perpetuating the ignorance that is responsible for thousands of deaths and injuries, than this book is for you. It is distasteful, irresponsible and reprehensible. Of course if you are a person who actually cares about the future and our children, you would agree that this book could be classified as a hate crime. And I don't want to hear any whining about the First Amendment: you can't yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater because of the potential harm it could cause. This is the same. Don't buy this book! I am only sorry that to be allowed to rate this book I had to give it a one, instead of the total ZERO that it is."
3,Understanding genius,"There never has been a genius who was not also quirky, it seems. Wallace's work, as most educated people will already know, paralleled that of his contemporary, Darwin, to whom Wallace humbly and rightly subordinated himself intellectually (no disgrace there). Wallace was, however, much more intrepid than Darwin, risking life and limb in the Malay Archipelago (his accounts of which themselves make great reading, and more interesting than this bio). From Raby's book we learn much about Wallace that is merely the composite drabness of which lives are inevitably composed -- factual, but not fascinating. That Wallace's acute powers of reason somehow coexisted with an incredible belief in the possibility of communicating with the dead is an eye-opener, and very difficult to understand. So, a true genius, but truly eccentric."
4,Excellent African adventure,"An enjoyable read about Zimbabwe. Anyone who has ever lived there or visted there should read it. You can almost smell that unique smell of Kariba, or hear the cry of the fish eagle with the descriptions laid out in the book. The cultural anecdotes or references are a real treat! Excellent descriptive writing with a story you will want to know the end of once you start the book. Well worth reading."
5,A Great Book for any Kappa Simga,"First thing is first. If you are a Kappa Sigma and want this book, PLEASE DO NOT BUY IT HERE. [...]Second, this book tells the coming of age of the newly founded American fraternity in 1869 and contintues until 1929. If you are a Kappa Sig, and a history buff, then this is the book for you! I have read it twice and loved every minute of it. Definitely a way to increase you fraternal knowledge"
4,MP3 1GB plus expansion card,"This is a great MP3 player for an even better price. Stores about 200 plus songs and has room for an expansion card with unlimited amount of additional storage! Tells the name, title of songs. Looking at buying more for friends."
1,Obsolete and poorly designed MP3 player,"This player doesn't even have the feature that ALL other, even the least expensive, players have - it does not resume. When you turn off the player it loses the position in the file and starts from the beginning. I called RCA/Thomson help desk and they blithely explained to me that this how they designed it."
1,Into the trash bin it goes...ooops!,"Good grief, they call this music? Someone gave me this CD, and I gave it as a donation to a thrift store, but regret not tossing it in the trash. This floozy named Britney Spears and her musical style is for the immature and morally vacant and is so lacking in content and class. Sorry, I can't stand this gal's music (good grief I said that word again...THIS IS NOT MUSIC, IT'S GARBAGE). Worth ZERO stars, but I regretfully am forced to rank it with a minimum of 1 star....ISH!"
3,First recordings of a future great band,"This album is of great interest for collectors. This band has recorded very few things, and here is their first contribution to the History of Blues. You'll hear first versions of tunes they recorded later in London, and it is very interesting to compare the different versions, if you are a good guitar player or a blues addict, which I am both. Buy this album, and buy McKenna Mendelson Mainline as well : the two go together, the second one being the achievement of the first one."
2,Ehhhh.,"Cute pictures. But that's about it. I found nothing usefull for me in the book. The best thing I ever learned about Chihuahua's is they are dramatic. My other dog snapped at her and made a bump on her head from doing that, I thought I was going to loose her for sure. She's fine, happy and healthy as ever and I don't over react when she squeeks out when she's hurt."
4,Chihuahuas Complete Pet Owners Manual,This book was purchased to find out more on Chi's I am in the process of purchasing a female to potentially show and breed. General info was good but was disappointed that there was not much info on breeding and colour with a little on genetics and pedigree info etc.Overall good book if you have no prior research onboard and I think it is good to have on your shelf as a general reference.
4,Must have for a chi,I really enjoyed this book because it really focuses on the breed. Other books I got were too general. I finished this one in 2-3 days because it was right on target. Pictures are varied and appropriate. I would definitely recommend this book.
5,Easy Read/ Good Information,I am very pleased with this little book. It is an easy read with lots of good information. I read it from cover to cover in less than an hour. Love the pictures. I am about to pick up my new pup and there was lots of good advice between the covers.
5,Not much of a sequel but more fun than the last one,"I got this game few days ago. Still being an old school gamer, I picked this game up for $5 at some store. It was like a destiny calling out to me! Ive been a huge fan of the first master of spirits, and when I started playing second one, I was hooked even more. The game follows up a different storyline unlike the first game (thats why I don't consider it a complete sequel), but as far as the quality of the game and the gameplay of the game are the same as the last one. This game is really fun, and I promise you that you will be addicted to it. If you're still unsure about buying this game, look up the gameplays on the YOUTUBE and see how much fun it is! THIS IS A GAME THAT YOU MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION, SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND READING THESE REVIEWS AND, GO AND JUST BUY IT ALREADY!! (With amazons cheap prices you cannot miss out on this game)."
2,"Big ear, Little ear......???","The send and respond sound quality seems to be ok, but it doesn't seem to hang on my ear SECURELY......don't know if that's because I have small ears......? Also the boom mic doesn't seem to want to stay by your mouth where it would be advantagous to have it located!?!?!Wouldn't buy this style again. I think the style with the over the head band would be my style of choice.......life is full of lessons."
5,IN DEFENCE OF DAVIS GAINES,"What's up with those reviewers who have given a ""serve"" to Davis Gaines?. I bought this version of ""Sweeney Todd"" expecting to see and hear a sub-standard performance by Davis Gaines. I believed every action, word and note from Mr Gaines and I'm glad that I'm now able to put a face to the name on a number of my favourite CD booklets.I believe that every member of the cast deserves the highest praise. This is an exceptional performance of Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece. Just listening to the way the cast, chorus and orchestra handle the difficult score fills me with awe.On my scale this rates 99/100. One point off for the shaving competion scene that has never worked in any performance I've ever seen, nor in this version."
3,Sweeney Todd in Concert,"I love this musical and have copies of all of the productions that are available. In this case, I was present for the concert and had fabulous seats. I enjoyed it then but didn't enjoy watching again. The reason for that was the artifically young look of George Hearn. Between his face lift and orange hair he looks like a bad copy of himself. The singing is great, but I would recommend the original verson or the new movie over this one."
2,Not the Best,"I really don't know why I bought this, as it isn't nearly as enjoyable as the TV version with the same Sweeny and Angela Lansbury. Neil Patrick Harris is surprisingly good, though."
5,I was there...,"I saw this very performance live, and saw the broadcast of it on PBS as well. It is FAR superior to the New York Philharmonic version available on CD. Although Patti LuPone still hams it up, she's calmed it down a bit in this performance. George Hearn is phenomenally great in his performance of Sweeny Todd--much richer and devastating than when he did it in 1979. Neil Patrick Harris, who I've seen in his role of Tobias 3 times, was never better than here. Victoria Clark as Johanna is sparkling. The only drawback is Davis Gaines, who's whinnying voice is just plain annoying. If he was a better actor, it might be fine. But he's just not a very good actor. Still, the show is terrific. Let's just hope they someday release the original show on DVD."
4,Not as good as original,"As much as I hate to say it, I think Ms. Lupone is the one thing I don't like about this production. While I recognize that her voice is powerful, I truly think that her acting range is limited. What I loved about Angela Landsbury's performance is that her ditziness made her loveable. In my opinion (my aplogies to the Lupone fans reading this) I think Lupone's choice of making the character more worldly comes across as evil instead of charming. I liked her rendition of ""Priest,"" but overall, I didn't like the quality she brought to Lovett. I had the same problem with her as Fosca in the recent Lincoln Center production of Passion. I think she is great when she plays someone like Evita, (strong, ballsy characters) but frail, cute, or sweet are not really her strong suit.It is still a very good production. Hearn is amazing, as are Harris, and Clark. The singing is fantastic, the concert setting really suits the show, not to mention it is one of the best musicals ever written."
1,Returned item,"I did not like the look and fit of this item so I returned it. I was however, very pleased with the return and refund process."
2,Sound OK - small ear fit terrible,"I'm a small male (5'4"" - 125lbs). I've tried for some time to use the Motorola Over-the-Ear technology for some time with no success. The oval shaped plastic cannot be adjusted for ears below a certain size and those without the requisate lobe geometry. I only use it on my cordless at home. In the car, it's actually more of a distraction than holding the phone to my ear because it just sort of dangles from the top half of the ear clip part.The sound quality is OK (caller and callee)."
2,Item received was not what I ordered,"The earpiece on the headset I received was not the same as in the picture. Rather than slipping over the ear, my headset was open at one end so it didn't grasp the ear well. It was reversible so it could be used on either ear but didn't stay on well. Also, the boom didn't have the windscreen pictured, and it was not adjustable. I returned the item and will try to find another."
3,Much too highly adapted,"The illustrations are okay, but this adaptation strays too far from the original story. She gives the dwarves silly names, worse than Disney, Fred and Ted--good grief. And naming the dwarves serves no purpose. The ending is totally made up. In Snow White, there is no shattered mirror, no enchanter who reclaims it, if you want to write your own story do so--why muck with the fairy tales."
3,"Horribly overpriced, not that comfortable, but it helps.","First off the price is absurd. It's worth about $10. It's not that wide, and I can feel the edges cutting into my back. It's not that thick. And they were chintzy on details, such as the strap that goes around the seat. I have it on my car's bucket seat, and it doesn't reach all the way around. Plus the friction buckle the strap feeds through slips,and so you can't even pull it tight.Second, it's memory concrete, not foam, when the temperature drops below freezing, which it does for a whole lot of the country during winter months. It softens up slowly as the car warms, but the key word is slowly. Till it does, your back is up against a rock.It's value is that it seems to be helping my back. It does offer lumbar support, and that's what I bought it for.But the rave reviews above are not what I've found."
5,Favourite bedtime story,"It's not easy to find a book to please twin toddler boys, but this one is definitely a hit in our house. The pictures are original and very detailed, making it a great book to read over and over again as the kids point out familiar-looking objects. The story itself has a nice repetitive quality and a great twist on the classic tale. This is the *only* book in our vast library that must be read every night, and I'm not tired of it yet! Enjoy!"
4,"Pretty cute book, needs thought out though a little more","This is a cute book - and is very detailed on the makings of a pizza. But when the hen asks for the help of her friends many, many times, she's turned down each time but still offers them some pizza in the end. Supposedly because it was too large for her to eat alone. However, the friends do clean up in the end but I think they shouldn't have been offered the pizza at all or she should have invited the other folks that helped her, i.e. the store clerk, to eat the pizza with her friends looking on drooling. It isn't a good idea to teach children that it is okay to not do anything yet expect everything from others. Where's the character building in that one?"
4,Beautiful Illustrations,"A wonderfully written retelling/sequel to the classic Little Red Hen story. This time, the Little Red Hen makes that kid-pleaser, a pizza.What really makes this a must-have is the incredibly detailed collage-style illustrations. Kids can look at this book over and over and find something new on each page every time. What are the 'other things' Little Red Hen brings home from her shopping expeditions? What other project does she do that day, besides make a pizza? Look at the illustrations to find out."
3,A moral story with a new moral,"I read this book to a student during some volunteer work. While I liked the way the classic story had been made more urban in order to be more associational for many readers, I was disappointed in two places.The first is a little trivial, when the Hen needs cheese, it mentions all the cheese she has, including string cheese, but no mozzarella. Unfortunately, string cheese is mozzarella.But my real problem is that the original moral of the story, that the lazy animals do not benefit from the Hen's hard work. Instead they all get some pizza and are guilt-tripped into helping clean up.While I can accept the change in scenery (and pizza instead of bread), I have a hard time accepting that the moral has been changed."
3,very cute - but I have mixed feelings about change in moral,"I checked this out of the library thinking it would be an update of the classic tale. I loved the colorful illustrations and my daughter did enjoy the book. However, I had been expecting the typical story -- where those that didn't participate in helping didn't get to share the product. I was surprised that after all the rounds of ""not I"" the other animals did eat the pizza. I'm not sure what the moral is supposed to be, or if it is one that I want for my daughter. Sure, I would like her to be generous and share, so if she models herself after the hen, great. But I don't want her to mimic the other animals attitudes toward helping out. The others do help with the dishes at the end, but still.... you just need to be aware of the change before you bring the book home."
4,"nice Video Camera, poor picture camera...","I check on Amazon what was the better camera, both price and quality, and this looks like a simple, yet reliable camera, and to be honest, it is. I'm not a pro, I will not claim to be one, but it is very simple to use and even more to ""finish"" the DVD once is full.But it has some details:a) the still camera (picture) is very very poor, and of course, if you want nice quality pictures, you should get a real camera (my old olympus D540 of 3.2 is by far better).b) the microphone of the camera is on top of the lens, so this fades the voices of the target, which happen to be in front of the camera.But... overall is good.Good luck..."
3,Nice camera with one huge flaw,"This is a great camcorder but Sony has ruined it by having a warning pop-up every time you turn the camera on saying that ""Sony discs are recommended"". I dont want to pay premium prices for Sony discs, and I want to be able to turn the camera on and begin filming right away. Unfortunately, I can't do this because of the warning and there is no way to disable it."
1,Extremely disappointed - died after a year only used 3 times,"I had always been a Sony fan. But no more.I only used this handycam 3 times.When I went to use it the 4th time the LCD malfunctioned and recorded jibberish. Of course it was just after the year warrantee expired.I contacted Sony and was told it was outside of the warrantee period so it was my problem.No more Sony products for our family.We were going to buy a Sony vaio laptop for our college freshman but bought a Dell instead after this experience.My husband wanted a Sony Bravia HDTV, but we bought an LG instead.If you buy this, make sure you buy an extended warrantee as Sony will not stand behind their product."
1,Movie Recording Disabled,Product was ok for about a year. Just got a message that the sony handycam movie recorder is disabled and now I can't finalize the disk. Great. Just lost the last half of my son's last basketball game.Also displeased with this camera's ability to only record 30 minutes of video at a time.I have a friend who owns another brand mini dvd camera and he is constantly having trouble with bad discs.Stay away from the mini dvd platform completely!
3,Average performer,"This was not as easy to operate as I had hoped. Finalization was sometimes difficult to manoeuver. Some good features, but on the whole, I would rate it just average."
3,"Works as advertised, but have problem with shipping",The camcorder works just fine and I am relieved that it does because it arrived in a large shipping box with no packing material inside. The box that the camcorder comes in (the Sony box) was bounced around in the shipping box during transport. I am surprised that there is no apparent damage. (so far)
1,NOT COMPATIBLE W/APPLE'S iMOVIE,I bought this camera to do video-blogging and to record special events with the intent to edit them in iMovie. Then I learned that Sony is a slave to Windows and isn't compatible with Macs. I was hugely disappointed and plan on returning it to get a Mac-compatible Canon.
1,Sad experience,"There are two major problems with this camcorder. It's incompatible with mac and the quality of still-image is extremely low.1. If you are mac user, as I am: don't bother buying. Sony is a slave to Microsoft, so the output files (vob file format) are basically useless. Not only you can't import them to iMovie, but also you can't PLAY your footage on your Mac. Unless you download semi-legal software, rip the file (30min process), and are ready to sacrifice audio, the camcorder will be useless. This is a huge disappointment.2. Still-image function is a joke. I first jumped on this option (we spent 2 months traveling in Europe this summer), because the perspective of carrying camcorder and camera at the same time was unpleasant. I downloaded the pics onto the computer only to learn, that I captured our beautiful memories with cell phone like quality pictures.This equipment was nothing but a sad experience. I will never buy anything by Sony again."
3,Handycam Review,I used the camara on my trip to Maui and was very satisfied with the ease of handleing as a user.
1,Handycam Camcorder,I purchase a Sony Handycam Camcorder as a christmas gift. It arrived minus the small DVD disc totally spoiling the gift for my friend who wanted to take movies of the family. Shame on you!
3,Okay but...,"For general things this video camera was just okay. The quality was not what I thought it would be and it is difficult to transfer video to an editing software and then onto a DVD. Many times my video file will say it's corrupt. One thing I noticed in multiple reviews is the camera saying the disc is unreadable or whatnot. I learned early on if you stop recording and then start recording again before the disc at the top right of your screen stops spinning, it will corrupt the disc. Several times of doing this on one disc and you will lose all footage. I learned this while videoing in Europe. A hard lesson to learn. Just be sure to wait until the disc stops spinning before turning off the camera and before recording again. Bottom line, we bought this several years ago, now there are equal quality cameras for much cheaper."
2,Not computer friendly.,Hard to find the right software to view on my computer. Hard to edit also. Hard to find sleeves for these small discs. Discs don't hold much info either. Other than that a pretty cool cam.
4,Sony DCR-DVD 108,"This is an easy to use little camera with a great zoom. The color and definition is far better than I thought, in well lit areas. In lower lighting the color is flat, the picture is darker than the surroundings and not real clear. For outside, daytime, or well lit rooms, it is perfect."
4,great buy-,"This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. Its easy to use, the quality of the picture is great for the price, and its small enough to bring anywhere. FYI it does not come with any of the discs."
4,Good value for the price paid,Good DVD camcorder . Powerful 40x zoom. Great Deal. Does not come with statrup Mini DVD or Memorystick. So Buy that seperately.
5,the best,"this sony video camera is the best, take pictures and videos, is small and very beautifull....the image is very clear but the best is the price, i always check other stores before i buy something and it cost so much in other stores that i was very happy with the price....is a very nice gift for christmas..my wife love it....."
3,I have a big issue with this camera,It does everything it promises but it has a major (in my opinion) problem. It records on the mini DVDs and they only come in 30 min or 60 min recording time.The problem is you have to stop every 30 minutes to change or flip the disc. In my experience this is damn inconvenient. I never realized how short 30 minutes can be. And all those discs! I have only had the camera since just before Christmas and have already amassed 7 discs. That's just three and a half hours.Otherwise it is a good video camera.JewelHouston
2,Amateurs beware!,"It's a splendid camcorder, but it's quite a trick to copy your videos over to a computer and then edit them. The camcorder records in a special format, then you need to find and download a ""codec"" for your computer to read the files, and then I've still had all kinds of compatibility problems. The software that comes with the camcorder really isn't much help. Be prepared for a major project in figuring out how to make it all work."
3,Image quality less than expected,"The quality of the image created by this camera is somewhat less than what I had expected. The final product results in a large number of horizontal/interlaced lines, especially if the camera is panning, or the subject is moving. Also, the microphone picks up considerable noise, especially wind noise, or the noise of the camera being handled. Otherwise...many features and options. Good optical zoom. I dislike the mini DVD format...only 30 minutes of recording.My previous video camera, the Sony DCR-TRV320 produced an excellent image...practically professional quality, and it recorded on DV tape. It is a much heavier and larger camera. This small camera will fit in your pocket!"
5,Outstanding Amazon.com Customer Service,"I agree with all the reviews that am extremely happy with the camcorder. It is perfect in every way.What I'm really commenting on, however, is the one reviewer that rated Amazon.com's Customer Service as ""one star"". I cannot disagree more with that rating. I've ordered hundreds of products from Amazon.com and without exception, service has been stellar! I've had several dealings with Customer Service and they have always been responsive and courteous! I have NEVER has a bad experience! Amazon.com has earned my confidence and respect.For the record: I am not associated with Amazon.com in anyway other than a customer."
5,Very good camcorder,"I used the camcorder to record my entire Hawaii trip with my family. This is very handy, easy to use. I used -RW 's from Sony. Also I used dual layer RW's from JVC. They work great. Dual layer is better, because you can record upto 1 hour in standard mode. This is my second sony camcorder after 11 years and I love it. Finalizing the DVD is very easy, except that you get a warning not to vibrate the camcorder. I could connect the camcorder to both TV as well as my notebook. Haven't done any editing on the recorded movie."
4,Buen producto - Good product,"Otro producto sony que complace al comprador funciona muy bien solo deberian de optimizar el sistema para abrir la tapa del dvd es un poco complicado y desesperante, presionas el boton y no sabes cuando se abrira"
4,Great Product,"This is a great camera, esp. if you are like me and just need family video in an easy format. I love that it records straight to dvd and that I can finalize the disc right in the camera. Everything is very easy to do too, it is all touch screen and so simple. Quality is decent, just don't move around too much while recording. Definitely a great product and Amazon has the best price!"
2,Don't buy this camera,"Although this product did have good zoom and sound quality, the picture quality was horrible. The colors were very dull and dark. It was not cooperative when opening the disk compartment and it was very small to hold. You need to use a tripod or get sick while watching your video. You also have to use the touch screen to do most tasks and that sucks down the small amount of battery life they provide you with."
3,O.K. Camcorder,This camera has nice features and a cool touchscreen but the video quality is not great. When your watching the movie back it looks a little shaky even if the camera is held still. The video quality outdoors is better but it does not have a wind cut setting so it sounds like you are in a hurricane. I do like the fact that I don't have to re-record from a tape to dvd with the chance of accidently erasing something important.
1,Very Sad:(,"Same disappointing problem as a lot of people. ""movie recording disabled"" This is the forth time it has happened. After going through tech support and getting no answers it is time to get a new camera that is not Sony!! So disappointed...many family memories erased."
1,Broke after a year of limited use,"This camcorder was fine until it turned a year old and went kaput! And we didn't use it that much. Screen just went static, then blank. Now, it just won't go on. Sony's Help desk couldn't figure it out over phone, so we've got to send it back for a $160+ repair. I've tossed it and am looking for a new one. What a waste."
1,"No service, warranty is a Sham!","The unit workered fine until the LCD screen failed. The camcorder was still under warranty for parts and labor. (90 days) I only got the run-around from Sony. They had me send it to the repair center at my cost to reair it. After numerous phone calls, they refused to fix it under warranty. They thought it was damaged by being dropped. All I did was turn it on and it failed without physical damage. That was their out and wanted to charge me $211 for labor. I will never buy from Sony again because of their lack of service and warranty."
1,Hard to use,"Takes nice pictures but it is a pain to get from the camera into a computer where you can actually edit the footage. I have had nothing but trouble when it comes to this step, usually because the computer will not recognize the disc, and will not pull up the file when it is connected to the camera direcly. Overall I like Sony equipment but I don't think this is a great product, and I would not recommend it.Why would you sell a camera that won't load it's information into a computer ? I am running Vista on my newest computer (like we have a choice?)and still have an XP computer so I am going to try that to see if it works any better."
3,ok for the price,ok camcorder for the price but quality is not overwelming. I would have expected something better from Sony.
5,Purchased as a gift,"Purchased the camera as a gift for our daughter and family. Very well satisfied with our purchases from Amazon.As for the camera, we will find out after our daughter uses it for awhile."
2,Not Mac compatible,I returned the product after one use because I'm a Mac user and it is not compatible with I-MovieThe camera seemed ok but I was disappointed.
2,Almost - but where was the service?,"I like the camera and it is easy to use once you have the required recording devices. I received the camera at my vacation destination (poor prior planning on my part). Other such equipment always arrives with all the necessary equipment to begin use immediately. This camera did not. I had to find a store with compatible recording disks, which was not all that easy. I could only find a disk for the movie application but not the still/digital camera. Also the formatting for the downloading is quite involved and not really intuitive. Downloading the applet also called for me to remove my CD burner applet - not a happy camper on that since I have not found a way to burn CD's again without reloading my burner applet, which may impact the movie capability.Good camera - poor planning!"
5,Camcorder,I got this camcorder for a graduation gift and it was huge hit. The touch screen is awesome and it is very simple to use. The battery life is two hours long. Good deal!!
2,MoneysWorth,"The camcorder does a decent job of recording, the 30 minute disk limits what can be done with the camcorder. It's fine for family gatherings, etc. The software that comes with the camera was a real disapointment, I have not been able to combine disks to put on a regular dvd. I guess it is good for the money you pay for it. The 40X zoom is a plus, it allows a good picture from farther away. Betty Haith"
4,Great camcorder for the price,"So far, this has proven to be a good buy. The image stabilization worked even better than I expected and I have not had any issues in low light conditions despite there being no built-in light. If you want to record long sessions, you may want to pre-format your mini-DVDs or spring for a media card because it takes several minutes to swap out unformatted media. My only serious complaint is inconvenient battery charging. The only way to charge the battery without buying an overpriced charger is to plug the included charger directly into the camcorder. The location of the plug is very bad. I'll probably break either the plug or the socket if I don't spring for the external charger."
5,Little powerhouse,"I bought this camera last fall, I have been without a video camera for a few years and was missing out on a lot of our kids' lives. I used this to tape my kids' christmas concerts and was sitting on the other side of a dark gym and was able to zero in on my childs face and get a great shot.The battery holds a decent size charge.I found the camera super easy to figure out and the discs go right into my computer CD drive and I was easily able to download and edit them in my computer. I am not super computer knowledgable either.My one complaint is that I can't find DVD's large enough to record more than 30 minutes at a time, usually 30 minutes would be plenty but for my daughters gymnastics recital it wasn't enough time and we are going on vacation and I would rather not have to take a bunch of discs with me."
4,Lou Rawls' Grand Finale Album: Christmas,"Lou Rawls' didn't sound sick on this album at all and truly brought emphasis to Jazz/R&B for the Christmas sound. He really did justice for the majority of the holiday songs on the album and for me personally, it was an extraordinary purchase, one that I don't regret. It's a must have for anyone that wants to add to the Christmas cheer."
2,A real no-no,"I love and respect Lou Rawls and his music. But I wish I had never bought this particular CD. His illness translated to and through his music. It was so depressing to me, I had to stop playing it and decided never to play it again. I give him three cheers for issuing this. It's just that I wish I hadn't played it."
3,I really Love Lou,but to be truthful I ordered that wrong album and I didnt like this as much as I had thought i would . So Christmas is over and I might get the one I really wanted next year
4,Let the transmitting EP,"This is Sikth's first real release and its absolutely blinding starting with the phenomenal track 'Such The Fool' a dark chaotic melee of harsh vocals and soaring gituars. 'If you weren't so perfect' leads nicely into the staccato 'Hold my finger' which is a crisp, refeshing song full of unexpected time changes and breakdowns.Overall a good picture of Sikth before their recent 'Trees are dead' album."
4,Bruce Shelley knows his readers.,"The subtitle is quite accurate. Shelley tells the reader in the first few pages that he is not a theologian, but he is a professor of religion and Christian history. He has answered students' questions for many years. He uses the language of the lay person and tells us what we need to know. This is a good book for the Christian reader or someone thinking about Christianity."
1,Good for temporaray use only.,"I wouldn't call this an urn - it's a temp. receptacle for ashes - they are plastic,not beautiful and very impersonal. You wouldn't want to put this out, and I doubt you would want to be put in a plastic container."
1,Poor quality,Cheap looking plastic. Picture is deceiving. Could not lay my cat of 18 years in this. Had to reorder from somewhere else.
4,more hot full length exclusive mixes!!!,"Although I think volume one better overall, this one gets marks for exclusive remixes of artists like Softcell, Whitney Houston and Pink. But overall, the remixes and remakes on volume one are better. This one becomes very commercial and routine. These are not beat mixed, and all full length extended remixes on 2 discs. pretty hot."
3,Hard workout!,"I liked several aspects about this workout video. First of all, the warm-up and cool-down routines are GREAT. So many workout videos barely spend any time on either which can cause pulled muscles. Also I found this workout to be fun, but very strenuous at times.The first two aerobic segments are effective and fun, and really get your blood pumping. The first strength workout is GREAT and really works all the areas of your upper body that many other workouts don't even address.The third aerobic segment is a little strange, it includes moves that are physically awkward and don't clearly work any of your muscle groups. The second strength segment is awkward and seems arbitrarily thrown together, similar to the third aerobic segment.Finally on a personal note, I cannot stand the woman who leads this workout. Her peppy cheerleader attitude got on my nerves after a few workouts.."
2,"Good workout, terrible music","I agree with another reviewer - great cardio toning exercises and routines, but if you have any sense of rhythm whatsoever, this workout will drive you insane. It sort of feels like a foreign movie with voices dubbed - like they recorded the workout session first and then superimposed the boring music in the background. The second time I did this routine, I decided to set it to mute and found my own electronica music that would fit. But this proved frustrating as well because it was hard to find my own music that worked. To a person like me who is inspired by the music in step classes and aerobics classes to push him / herself, this workout was very disappointing."
3,knowledgeable if unremarkable novel,"In the English countryside, a scientific team testing a new biological radar (a system that can detect biological organisms in an environment) locks horns with a local coven of witches practising Black Magick. Fortunately, some of the members of the scientific team are psychics who know a thing or two about White Magick. Thus, their advanced technology can do little but record psychic fields as the forces of Good and Evil battle it out.Author Stewart Farrar was the High Priest of a white witch coven, so this mildly entertaining novel is more of interest for its knowledge of occult ritual (it helps for the reader to have some basic familiarity with modern witchcraft) than it is for any thrills, especially for readers more attuned to violence and gore than more reasoned examinations of the occult. A little atmosphere would have gone a long way toward making this novel more memorable, but it's not bad for those who enjoy this kind of thing."

1,Awful is the word,Just awful! It had velcrow strap that would flip around and the glitter fell off. Not what was picutred at all! I cryed after I saw this. I could have made my own for less then $40. Bad quality and poorly made. Im just so upset after getting my hopes up for a very glamourous dress for cheap. It also didn't fit in the bust and im a size 14!
3,inconsistent writing style,"Although it does give good coverage of 4.4 BSD, I was surprised to see that both reviewers gave it 5 stars. A number of the chapters are very tedious to read and don't explain things as well as they should. I would recommend it only after the reader had read Vahalia's and Bach's books."
3,"packed with facts, however there is little joy","If you are already a BSD kernel expert you might use this as a reference. If you're an advanced ""userland"" programmer who wants to start learning about kernel internels, this is one way to proceed but, it is very, very difficult.I wish Kirk had decided to show us more of the joy of programming the kernel. If he had, the book would have been worth at least twice it's current price."
2,Repackaged DVDs,"This set contains ""U2: An Unforgettable Journey"" and ""Bono: God's Favourite Son,"" both of which are previously released; unfortunately, the outer packaging and the Amazon listing don't mention this. If you already have them, you may want to think twice about purchasing this."
1,Take Note: This is an UNAUTHORISED documentary,I was truly looking forward to receiving this DVD from reading the description. The photo of the DVD does show all of the print on the item but I didn't bother to enlarge the image and read it. BEWARE: This is an unauthorised documentary and DOES NOT contain any original U2 music. Really a disappointment. Some of the footage was new and interesting but most things I had already seen or read in U2 books.
1,What a disappointment,"I thought this would be a videography of the band U2. Well - it's about U2, but there is NO U2 anywhere (well - maybe some pictures) on this DVD and worse yet, no U2 music. Which you do not know until you put in the DVD and the disclaimer comes up that this is only about U2, U2 did not authorize any of this and no music of U2 would be presented on this DVD.So if you want to watch 90 boring minutes of people who do know U2 and talk endlessly about them, then this DVD is for you. It is NOT Rattle and Hum, it is HoHum. I couldn't send it back to amazon because the return date came and went, but I actually sent the DVD's back to the studio in England who made it and told them what a worthless piece of crap they are selling to an unsuspecting U2 fan base.Don't waste your money."
2,U2 collector's box set.,"Do not let the cover of this set fool you....what the cover says is absolutely a falsehood of what the contents actually are. The DVD's in this set are ""UNAUTHORIZED"" Biographies which does not include any of U2's music (due to copyright laws)or actual interviews conducted by the media company that put the DVD together. The interviews or any footage of U2 in these DVD's are from clips of old news shows, talkshows, etc. but are very, very brief and sometimes repetetive!There are also interviews mostly from people who knew the band, wrote about them or were aquainted with them in some way.If you are a big U2 fan as I am and are looking for an in depth biography about U2 from the beginnings until now, interesting interviews, U2's music and the like you will be very dissapointed with this set. I think Larry, Bono, Adam and Edge should find out who made this set and kick the crap out of them."
3,Music,"The Item arrived on time, in new condition--however I either misread description or it was vague, I was under the impression this was a history of band with music, not just music"
5,Problem solved!,"This works very well! I used to rip my letters apart when I opened them with a tool from Office Max, but now the letters just slide out so easily.I hoped this review helped you!"
5,The Power of a Praying Woman,"I found this book quite by accident. I had already bought too many books on the subject of marriage, but this one was different. I thought my marriage was perfect.. so that is where the enemy attacked. It was so easy before, now I see it is something we always need to work on.. like in a beautiful garden, there is always work to do. The more time you spend on a garden the more beautiful it becomes..marriage can be the same! I know now I need to pray for my marriage and especially for my husband. Like the author, I had already been praying for my children. This book not only helped me with how to pray for my husband, but it convicted me in areas I was completly unaware of. I cried. This book is a much needed tool for all marriages, and I wish I had read it even before I met my husband."
1,DONT BUY THEM ITS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! ! DONT BUY!!,They picture shows a bullet shaped speaker an modern looking. Well.... you get a square almost speaker outta the 80s. There ugly an nothing close to what picture shows! DO NOT BUY!! Plus the shipping is very slow. I love amazon an nvr any problems til this an very disappointed
2,Wake Board Speakers???? REALLY!!!!!!!,"Don't but these unless you are expecting just a box speaker. I bought these to use on my pontoon boat. They are not what the picture looks like! I ended up using them having to build my on mounting enclosure. All in all, don't sound half bad for the price."
3,Speaker sounded pretty good but pic on add was wrong,Bought these because price and they were addvertized as fitting a wake board structure. They were not as pictured but hooked them up to our outside RV Stereo and they sounded pretty good so kept them.
1,Doesn't work,"Unfortunately, this device looks pretty, and that's about it. I, like the person above me, get the ""Hub as exceeded power requirements"" and this was on a full blown PC, not just a laptop. I have a Targus ultra mini hub plugged into the same USB port, and it didn't have any problems.Targus ACH74US Ultra Mini USB 2.0 4-Port HubThe targus is a much better product."
1,so sad,"Like f. welsh i have collected slim's songs since the 50's. Have loved all his songs, but I must say this is the worst cd of slims songs that I have heard The recording is horrible.the re-mastering terrible.So sad the the very first song by slim is treated this way....soooo sad."
4,For Those Who Enjoy Cultural Anthropology,"I wish I had taken more cultural anthropology classes in college, but reading a book like Unity of the Heart is like taking a course you would pay thousands of dollars for today with rising tuition costs. It is a shame the authors have not published more, because I really enjoyed their research on the people of Tuvalu. A must read for anyone who is interested in Pacific cultures."
5,The best lotus book so far.,"This book is simply a work of art. 256 pages in full color about all lotus cars past and present, how did I miss the first edition? Each car has at least 4 photographs: side-on, front, back and three-quarter. Some even have historical photos attached! Each car also has a detailed chart outlining more technical details than you'll ever want to know. Cars included start with the lotus 7, 9 and 11 road cars and include every type of racing machinery imaginable. Everything from the rear-engine type 18 to the glorious and historical type 49 can be found. This, of course, means that every lotus, road going and otherwise is included in the book. Also included are pictures of pit passes, driving suits, drivers, and even a prototype carbon-fiber bicycle. The total tally is 389 color portraits and 734 smaller images. No other lotus book I have read so far compares with this one."
5,loved it!!!!,I've always loved dark shadows... I remember running home from school to watch it and seeing the first vampire that I fell in love with.....
4,Good Classic,"I bought this album because it was recommended to me by a friend. It is a good addition to my collection. The album may become hard to get in the future, so if you are serious about your Latin music, get a copy now. Good album I give it 4 out of 5. Track number 8; Yambu (Ave Maria Morena); is a great song and worth buying for that one song; but the rest are enjoyable too."
3,Best Of??,"How can this be a Best Of without "" No Second Chance"" ?? What does Charlie have to do with Prism???"
1,Beware of Renaissance Records!,"One thing is for sure - you know what you get when you order from Renaissance Records: CRAP!This collection is certainly no exception, and how Amazon can collaborate with them is beyond my comprehension...Charlie was a really great band, and should be remembered with proper CD reissues and collections - NOT these CD's from the worst CD-reissue company ever!"
4,Charlie needs no second chance,"This album propelled them into the future, their sound was ahead of it time. Although they never really made the charts, this album is full of hits."
4,"Good basics, but no real step by step for beginners","This book provides excellent background and general information for someone starting out in bonsai. The photos are excellent and a wide variety of types are shown. However, I was expecting more of a guide on how to actually start growing a bonsai. There are a lot of references to finding ""a local club"" which would of course be helpful, but if you're just starting out (like me) and don't have a nearby bonsai club, you'll probably want additional books to guide you through getting started."
5,"My Alphabetics for ""Take Joy""......B for Buy The Book, You'll Be Glad You Did!","Checked this out from the library, and it wasn't far in reading that I realized that I had to get my own copy. This is a book that you will want to underline, highlight and keep out on your desk to refer to often!My personal collection of books on writing is small. I read all I can about writing (the how-to's, the work, the life, etc.) but most all of my reading material is from the library, and I am choosy about what books I buy. This book is a must have to my personal library, and tops on my favorites list!This is a book from a woman who LIVES writing. She has written over 250+ books! WOW! Her advice is Inspirational,Obviously Experienced, Honest, and Funny.Great book for writers!"
4,Teaching Tool,"Jane Yolen's book, TAKE JOY, was a delightful read. Peppered with charming vignettes, this book on writing has many uses as a ""teacher's guide."" There are a number of sections that can be adapted to the classroom (most appropriate for secondary school). For creative writing teachers in want of additional ideas, this slim, easy-to-read work would be a good investment."
4,YOU'LL LOVE IT OR HATE IT,vampirella is a shlocky b grade movie.she's played by a hot actress. she's very good...at times.roger daltrey is dracula(!)... who comes from space(!)... and is a rock star too(!)!i'm not making any of this up!vampirella is an alien vampire too and they all come from draculon! the tall man from phantasm is vampirella's dad and he says draculon's got blood fountains or some such thing. it's all natural blood that just comes out of the bleeding planet!daltrey/dracula escapes the planet and vampirella chases but gets stuck on mars where john landis (!) finds her and brings her to earth. she then has to stop daltrey/dracula from using a device in space to block out the sun so the vampires can make all humans vampires...and then they can all starve to death i guess!
3,pure cheese,"if you like pure cheesiness in movies this is one for you. horrible acting, horrible script. total waste of time. but if that's your thing then go for it."
2,could not watch. campy. am a huge fan of the franchise too,"Even with the names involved and the inclusion of Talisa Soto as the lead, not even mentioned as a major contributor here oddly and former PMOY Corinna Hanley received more credit, and Roger Daltery as Vlad could not help me finish this. I had the film on for maybe fifteen minutes and could not watch anymore. Huge fan of the comic books, from Warren to Dark Horse to Harris pub, and happy to call many involved in creatives my friends I could not bear the campy feel; and I think that's bad considering I watch many B movies and Toho Studios offerings. For the true fan at heart I guess and will try again to see if my opinion changes."
2,".....well,it is a B movie after all.....",It's everything one would expect from a B movie : bad special effects and horrible acting. Some of the minor characters did pretty good acting wise but unless one is a fan of Talisa Soto or Roger Daltrey or just vampires this is probably not the movie for you.
1,Read the comic instead.,"I rented this movie and it was a total mistake. I've seen cheesier flicks put out with bigger budgets. The character of Vampirella does not come across as so patsy in the comic series. It's a classic, this is not. Nice try, though."
1,The absoloute worst movie I have ever seen and ever will see,"This is without a doubt the dumbest movie to ever be allowed to hit store shelves. What a waste of anybody's time.Drakulon? You have got to be kidding me. And don't get me started on the camera work.The scene where the truck drives off the road, is the most horrible cinematics I have ever seen.My friends and I spent half an hour rewinding that and laughing at how cheaply that was done. And at the end where the villain is struck by lightning, you can see the protective gear he was wearing. If you put the scene where they transform into a bat in slow motion you can see that the bat is mearly a squiggly line. This movie simply shows that I could pull any idea out of my rearend and turn it into a movie no matter what the idea was. I have never seen such a bad movie in my life."
3,FUNNY TRASH,"Yes,there's not the standart of Marvel-Movies.Why?It's a B-Picture!It's cheap!!When you got this point and you are a fan from Vampirella-comics,dig that funny trash!Talisa Soto & Roger Daltrey are not so bad.Enjoy it with friends,chips & beer!"
1,Wampirella,I would personally like to thank Roger D head Corman for making sure a REAL Vampirella movie NEVER makes it to the silver screen after this debaucleAND had Hammer NOT shown Natashia Kinski nude at 16 we would have a real Vampi flickAnd WHAT is up with that costume?? Jeez boby paint with rubber prothestics it DOESN'T have to be an all in one suit peopleAND this was directed by Jim Wynorski of Deathstalker 2 fame--Talisa ('Tell Lisa') Is frikkin hot
2,Ain't What It Used to Be,"I used to look forward to each issue of Threads. There were always features that took sewing beyond the basics. They showed new creative ways to use fabrics and stitching. And there were articles on refined finishing techniques and pattern fitting.Well, Threads just is not what it used to be. I no longer subscribe. I flip through an issue when i see it at a newstand, but now i just shrug and put it back.This used to be a 5, but hasn't been for years, alas."
5,Great cooler!,"I've bought 2 of these coolers. Fit my 98 & 07 Corvettes perfectly. High quality and great price. No more worrying about overheating the trans while racing. On the 07 I installed it after the OEM cooler which is located inside the radiator. This allows the OEM ""cooler"" to actually heat the fluid on cold days. If you take the OEM out of the loop it'll be difficult to get the trans up to operating temp."
4,A Business Traveler,"I was amazed with the product quality and clarity. I have had 2 cars with traditional hands free systems and the quality this system is every bit as good.The system has worked well when traveling and using rental cars.The speaker and microphone sensitivity is very good. If you have problems with the speaker and microphone, you can plug your own in.The holders are a bit cumbersome however, having tested the plug-in chargers, this system is better.Time will tell on the reliability and durability."
2,What???!!!,"WHAT??? That's what you'll be saying more than anything else if you buy this item. You have to shout to be heard, and the frustration that this product generates negates any safety benefit gained from using hands-free. My advice: stay away and wait for the next generation models."
1,Cheap? That's just what you'll get here.,"Do you have any idea what "" I.O. couplings on straight end for positive seal"" means? I sure don't. No. they're not ""specially compounded to resist hot water 'softening' action."" Gimmee a break!"" That's just ad hype. Usually, when ""specifications"" are written by non professionals trying to impress, use terms like ""embrittle"", not ""softening."" Both are wrong, by the way. As for the burst pressure being 800 pounds ( of what?), substandard hoses have burst pressures of 1,100 p.s.i., which really isn't at all important. Highest quality, they say? Gimmee another break! Check out Floodchek."
2,Not for anyone who is unsure about dentists...,"This book describes pulling a tooth pretty graphically (complete with blood dripping off the tooth) and then the dentist tricks his fox patient by telling him what is really glue is a treatment to prevent toothaches.I'm sure older kids who are already familiar with their dentist would like this book, but it is NOT for small children or the faint of heart."
4,A book about trusting your enemies but not being foolish,An interesting kids book about serving those in need but not being foolish with their devious desires and safeguarding yourself.
4,Dr. DeSoto was a pretty good book.,"I liked this book because the pictures were well drawn. Also, my teacher recomended it to me because it was on of her favorites."
5,Simply Amazing!,"Jon's music is simply amazing and can change a person's mood very quickly. One of my favorites and recommended songs is waterfall! I love it! He is very entertaining also if you can ever make it to a live concert of his, I highly recommend it!"
4,great for decompressing your day,I really enjoy listening to August End when I need to decompress from a stressful day at work. I recently added this cd to my laptop media player so that I can now listen during the middle of a stressful day too. Truly enjoyable music!
4,and the story continues,"I didn't really like the SS series, actually like the original the best (hope they eventually come out with an uncut version of it on dvd), but this has been an interesting series as opposed to watching it on CN. In this one you get to see that fish-eye was actually a guy, and on the last episode of the disk, get to see the other scouts go super. It was an ok disk, but mostly just got it for collection purposes. Now if they would only release stars on to dvd."
1,"Cute, but that's all","I am a HUGE fan of Sailor Moon and I have to say that I was utterly disappointed when I got this. I received this, as well as Sailor Moon SuperS Pegasus Collections 1, 2, and 5 for Christmas of 2002.I had high expectations for the series at first, but those high expectations suddenly turned to low ones.This has to be the worst Sailor Moon season by far.It is completely boring and focuses mainly on Chibiusa and Pegasus.If you want to watch a good Sailor Moon season, watch either the first season (Sailor Moon) or the third (S)."
1,do not get this Dvd i repeat do not do not do not!!,I love Sailor Moon Super S but you know all you people are wrong about this dvd it contains phornography Don't buy it i was so shocked too now i can't return it either if your a kid or a adult do not get this you want your kids watcing Sailor Nude? fish eye takes off her shirt in the episode Love those minis!The fashionable soldiers i hate this i used to love sailor moon and now i hate it get cut because it doesn't even have anything in it that's bad ..........I'm a Christian i don't want to see images of cartoons that are Nude!
5,Pegasus Collection 3,"This is a great DVD and any sailor Moon fan should get it!There are 6 uncut eps1.Love Those Minis!The fashionable Soldiers2.Storm of love!Minako's(Mina's)Grand 2 Timing Plan3.Mansion of Secrets!The Menu of Love 2 U4.Time 2 Believe the Pegasus!The Super Transformations of the 4 Soldiers5.Sparkling Summer Days!Ami(Amy)the Girl in the Ocean Breeze6.Aim 4 the Prima!Usagi's(Serena's)BalletThese r some of the funniest eps in the season.U also find out out(the dub can't hide it)that Fish Eye is a man.But I'd stick with the sub.(I don't have much of a problem with the dub,but the sub is a lot better.)This is a great DVD and anyone should buy it! ^^"
2,Old and out of date,The print is very small for older eyes and the book was written many years ago. The blueing and browning techniques of today are far easier and simpler to use.I would not recomend this book for reblueing modern firearms.
5,top notch,"Having had this book for a while, I made my own hot tank, and have successfully blued and sold several firearms"
3,'Must read' for the gun enthusiast.,Good information on many recipes for do it yourself blueing and browning that is hard to find.
1,"Makes things shiny, but doesn't really remove tarnish.","Purchased this to remove tarnish from my brass wood burning stove door. It made the brass shiny, but really didn't remove much tarnish. This is one of the few things I have returned to Amazon."
5,A Literary Treat You Don't Want To Miss!!,"Poetry that amazes, startles and opens us to the pain, joy, and delight of this young poet's own reflections. Jimmy Autrey's thought provoking collection delves beneath the surface of his own life experiences. You will be mesmerized by his sometimes tender and often profound verse."
5,Easy to understand and good reference.,"Besides the summary of harmful ingredients in food, I really appreciated the chapter on detoxifying your bathroom. It's given me a tool in deciding what personal products to use on my body. We spend so much money on good nutrition so why poison the body by using toxic grooming products. This book is definetely an add to your reference library."
4,Suzanne has done it again!,"What a way to start (or finish) each day of the year 2000! I bought it for that purpose but could not wait to see what was in store, so I confess I have peaked at several days! Each time I found inspiration, comfort and tender words from the heart! She (Suzanne) has lived and survived more than any human should have to endure with beauty, grace and sheer will. What an inspiration to those of us who are 'survivors' --and aren't we all survivors of something! Thank you Suzanne--I'll enjoy spending a bit of each day in 2000 with you!"
5,Worth Buying,"After reading most of Suzanne Somers books, I've come to the conclusion that she has alot to offer us as readers. I am never disappointed with anything she has produced. I feel she puts her all into her projects, and there is obvious quality to this book. There is an honesty to Suzanne. She may not be a doctor or nutrition specialist, but she is honest and she is just offering ideas to us. Whether they work for us or not isn't the point. I think we need a shift in our thinking in today's society or this world is in deep trouble. This book suggests to us to think on a higher level and to go back to old fashioned values. We need more kindness and less animosity. I cannot understand why anyone would write a malicious or rude comment about this book. Why so much anger in the previous reviews? To me, I felt like reading this book was similar to talking to a good friend."
3,Nice costume sword,"This is a perfect costume sword. While I painted over the Zorro, this sword is great for anyone who wants a realistic adult size rapier, but still very much a plastic toy."
1,not that great...,The Product got here in good time. But the box was slightly coming apart and the third disc is so scratched i need to get it re-serviced because it wont play through.
2,price!,"The size is right. The info is OK, but the price is way over the top for its content. Look further."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!,"This was NOT the banner that I received! I ordered this one exactly, but I got just a plain blue banner with Detroit ""D"" logo. VERY DISAPOINTED!!"
2,poorly packed,"model was wrapped in one flimsy layer of tissue, so despite the double cardboard box, it naturally arrived damaged. Key card advertised was not in the package."
5,Top Chicago Doo Wop!,"As a collector of classic R&B; from the '50s and '60s I had to have this CD. Just about every track is a killer soulful Chicago Doo Wop. I had been looking for this CD for a while and I'm glad I found it. The Danderliers are awesome, except for ""Chop Chop Boom"" I had never heard any of their songs in digital remastered sound and I must say The Danderliers are right up with The Moonglows, The Flamingos and The Impressions as one the most talented groups to ever come out of Chicago. The Hornets, The Strollers, The Drakes, The Palms and one of my personal favorite obscure groups The Five Chances all delivered some excellent jams. 1 thru 24 an excellent CD!I highly recommend """"Bang Goes My Heart"" The Moroccos and other great groups on United""."
4,Creative and colorful,"I got this book for my four month old daughter and she (the true critic here) likes it. This is a rather small and short popup book that contains 6 popups of various endangered North American species. The popups are not interactive -- that is, you only have to open the page to make them pop up -- but are clever and filled with bright colors. My daughter seems mesmerized as we turn the pages, and the book holds her attention well. Her reaction is usually something like ""aaaaAAAAAAAHGGGGghhhoooOOOOAAaaa!"" said with a smile. A sign of a hit! And it's inexpensive to boot.The last part of the book is for adults, and contains suggestions on how to help protect our endangered wildlife."
3,"Great price, great gift, a little on the short side though",Bought as a gift and it wasn't quite long enough to keep feet warm but good for walking around and keeping warm. My Uncle loves it. Can't beat the price.
2,"Great Design, Poor Quality","This shirt is one of a kind. It was the only dark navy shirt with a large Chicago Bears logo on it that I could find. It was a little large for me, but looked great the first time I wore it. However, after just one wash, some of the logo started peeling off! I can't imagine what this shirt will look like after next season, probably will just be a navy long sleeve shirt...buy this shirt with caution!"
1,Junk T-shirt,"Reebok t-shirts are junk!!! This shirt was of very poor quality. Doesn't hold up and after the first wash the C was hardly legible. I ordered a Large as that is the size of shirt I wear and I don't know what Reebok was thinking, but this Large should be called a triple X. The tag on mine said Large, but this thing was HUGE. My shirt also came with a hole in the arm. Even as a Bears fan I would not recommend this shirt to anyone. Reebok needs to pull their heads from their butts and start making a quality t-shirt that IS what they say it IS! Until then, JUNK!!!"
3,Not bad,"The material was a little thinner that I would have liked, and the decal has a tendency to attract lint and other fuzzy things. Overall build quality is good, with no torn seems or hanging threads."
2,Does not live up to billing,We have had this device for over a week. On the ultrasonic setting can not tell whether or not it is working. Silent to us and the dogs continue to bark when someone comes to the door. On the audible setting now we have both the barking dogs and this hi pierced shrill when some one comes in the house. the dogs don't bark as long but it goes off for the slightest of loud noises in the house. Next option is to try a shock collar but I think I will get resistance from my daughters
2,Disenchanted,"They promised me up to 12 hours of run time per charge and I ended up only getting about a little over 4 hours of run time. It was a real let down for my kids and I because I bought it to help keep them quiet and entertained on a couple of long plane trips. Also, it didn't take very long (less than 30 days) for the unit to stop functioning altogether. I ended up returning it for my money back before I decided to pick up a BG 9-12-60 battery which has consistently been giving me no problems with 7+ hours of run time per charge on my 9V portable DVD player."
5,Inuyasha's complete movie box,I am so pleased I could find this box set at such a low price and came to me in less than a week. The condition of the box was excellent. My best friend is going to flip when she opens her Christmas present. I already bought all 4 movies before the box set came out but if I ever need to replace them. I know where to find the box set!
5,love it,Now rewatching all the seasons and extras from beggining to end up to the new seasons. Love it and so happy to own.
5,Practical Parenting,This is the book I would give to any new parent. I would also give it to any parent or teacher who would like to understand a child better. The author talks about what a child needs most and demonstrates how life changing - to the adult and to the child - it can be when it is provided. I found it opened my eyes to treasures I had right in front of me and took away some fears I had about relating to my children. It actually made parenting more of an adventure for me - what a priceless gift.
2,Not enough stars,"Poor production, poor dialogue, poor filming. The actors are good though but the script did not help. Watch only if you have nothing else to do."
2,Sanyo battery pack DB-L20 for Xacti camcorder,"I was really unhappy that this battery doesn't last as long as the original that it is supposed to be the same as (and it looks exactly the same). However it's a little better than the no-name batteries I bought in 2009, since it lasts longer than them, tho' the ratio of time the battery lasts/price paid is the same. For the price, this isn't very good!!! This is the 21st century - why can't we have better batteries (and not so many different ones - different kinds for each device - that aren't interchangeable)!"
5,It's a battery,"Not much to say about this product, it's a battery and it holds a charge. With my waterproof Sanyo Xacti, I am able to record video for about 1 hour continously."
1,THis is A Ripoff!,PAY ATTENTION!You can get batteries like this for $10 if you shop around!Don't pay these outragious prices!Simple.......right?
1,Don't be Fooled,"I read the good reviews, and was badly fooled. I like Fatboy Slim very much, but this was one of the most tedious albums I have ever purchased. The voice of Linda Lewis is very nice, but the first ten tracks nearly put me to sleep. ""Lazy - X Press 2"" is the first barely-tasty track (#11) but wasn't nearly enough to rescue this disc from my trade-in pile.I think you had to be there."
1,Horrible!,This is not like the DVD at all.This is a totally different. Some of the tracks are the same but mixed in the wrong order. I would not not buy this CD. I loved the DVD and have watched it many times - the CD is not the same and you will be disapointed. I wish I had better news.
3,Only for die-hard fans....,"If you're a die-hard Redwall fan then you'll really love this kit; otherwise you may wish to pass.It's simple to assemble and takes about an hour in all. The some detail is quite good, but the ""true"" detail is lacking. (Redwall is home to many creatures, yet there is only about 4 bedrooms.) I'd recommend some Scotch invisible tape to go along with this kit as it is very unstable but otherwise the kit in general is so-so.The story/riddle book that comes with it is better and some of the cut out characters are cute, appart from Matthias, he looked rather stoned.The price isn't really worth the kit, and in all I think it could've been done much, much better. Truly for die-hard Redwall fans."
3,A Little Scotch Tape helps!,"Having a Redwall Abbey in the house is a real treat. However, it's very tedious to put together. I cheated and used a bit of tape here and there.I've read all of the Redwall books out loud to my two older children and am now starting the whole cycle again to my third (and much younger) child. It's a great excuse to read them all again!Be sure to have read several of the books before buying this one. My top four (in no particular order): Mossflower, Salamandastron, Martin the Warrior, & Mariel of Redwall."
1,Much too flimsy,"We bought this several years ago. The design and illustrations and detail are wonderful, but the abbey and characters are printed on the flimsiest of board. Put together, the abbey won't stand up. Any humidity at all makes the walls curve and fall. You can't mount it on sturdier board, because, of course, both sides are printed. It's a beautiful design, but we were so disappointed that it's printed on such thin poster board and isn't practical to set up. A real disappointment."
3,"good, but not great","I bought this last year and thought it would be a great decoration for my room. The finished product looks great and it includes a cool little short story, but the durability is very, very poor. The walls aren't very strong, they keep sagging inwards, making the abbey look as if it is going to collapse. you also need to sellotape some parts during construction. the abbey keeps moving around on the plastic 'playmat' and the little paper figures look quite ridiculous. I would not reccomend this to a little toddler, maybe some between 4-7 years of age."
2,Could have been better...,"I was excited by the idea of a glueless assembly, but the paper construction design is horrible. I didn't want to touch it for fear it would fall over, it was so unstable. The illustrations were really nice, and the included tale ""The Warriors Code"" was very nice, but the construction design was really bad. I wouldn't pay the money for this product."
4,Certainly an Entertaining Read,"This was certainly an entertaining read. The concept of duals is quite interesting and well done here. However, it seemed quite a lot of emotion evolved in the relationships in such a short time that it was somewhat unrealistic. It was even commented on in the book, but no real substance supported why it happened or why the reader should buy in that it was true love. That was my one complaint though and I could certainly look past it when considering how well the story was told. I certainly recommend it."
1,Waste of money,"Don't waste your money on this ""second room"" wireless speaker. The signal barely reached into the second room and then it was weak and flickered on and off. I tried to return it but Panasonic wouldn't take it back."
1,Don't bother.,"I bought this to use as another set of speakers when playing mps cds. It won't get a clear signal halfway through the house (maybe 25ft). Basically it only works when it's so close that you can hear the other speakers clearly...whats the point. Nice idea, poor product."
3,Not Just for Kennan Fans,"Not only students of Kennan's foreign policy writings will get something out of this book. The topics are wide-ranging, and the observations are thought-provoking. I especially enjoyed his thoughts on our addiction to automobiles. One criticism is the writing style, which is generally stuffy and verbose. (For example: ""But what, to me, distinguishes this Spirit from the all-powerful Deity of established Christian doctrine is precisely the fact that the Spirit bears, in my view, no responsibility for the natural order of things in which the human individual is compelled to live."") Nevertheless this is a worthwhile book."
5,The Wisdom of Age,"George Kennan is a legendary historical character about whom one could have strong political opinions. This book was written in his latter years (I think he lived to 97!) and it provides fascinating ruminations on life, living and the world in which we live. His perspective could be claimed by many different political stripes but ultimately he is a ""gentleman"" and there aren't many of those left."
1,dumb idea,"If your going wear this stuck to your upper arm, tell me how your going to see or navigate your ipod. You can't, without cranking your neck at a very radical angle. The solution is the standard waist-band clip ipod holder---common sense rules!"
4,"A very good book, shallow attacks notwithstanding","This book is a serious attempt to see the tradition of Taoism in all itsglory through Christian eyes, a very worthwhile effort indeed. The book is especially helpful to thoughtful Christians who have little or no idea what Taoism is, or was, or could be. This book attempts to avoid misrepresentation of both faith traditions and to foster understanding, and by and large it succeeds gracefully.Taoism isn't about being self-sufficient. It is about grounding in the Tao, that which is, the divine--which is as much to say the ordinary. If you understand that, you'll understand this book."
1,"A book that is for the christian,,,Not the Taoistl","I read as much of this book as I was able to without losing my dinner. I did replace it back on the shelf at the bookstore... Eastern thought cannot be compared to primitive christian thought and I find it quite obnoxious and amusing that this author has tried to relate Taoist thought with inferior and primitve chistian belief systems...I must admit though, if your a Taoist, this book will provide some humor as the ingorance is quite humerous."
5,Ambient Ease,I play this to start a class. I play it at dinner time for friends. I play it when I need to unwind but want something of substance as well. This does it all with good taste.
2,Gently plodding,"2 1/2The pastoral sounds emanating from Frayne's hypnotic strumming is, at best a glowing pulse of subtle melodic flux, and at worst a deadened, repetitious bore. Most of this album unfortunately carries both extremes. Lanterna certainly appreciate the intricacies needed to pull this sort of introspective songwriting off, though certainly coasts by with a luke-warm predictability as well."
5,Hilarious and suspenseful - I couldn't put it down.,"The most fun I've ever had reading a suspense novel. Dark twisted humor mixed with a smart, unpredictable plot. Can't wait for the next book from Ms. Sacks."
3,Fun wild ride.,"This is a short, fast paced and fun book. The act of killing is a metaphor for any weakness you personally may have. So it may even teach you a thing or two about yourself. Not one of the greatest novels of our times but definately a fun read on a rainy day !"
2,"An interesting idea, but fell short","When I read what this book was about, I knew it was something I had to read. This idea had enormous potential to be a great read, but I felt that the story just fell flat."
3,"""Nice"" is the perfect word to describe this book...","...although I enjoyed it, I find myself unable to be as enthusiastic about it as the other reviewers. Entertaining, but if you are looking for depth, look elsewhere. Maybe I couldn't relate as well because I live in a much smaller city than NY, but I found some of the things Grace did (ex cowboy boot incident) somewhat extreme, although I am woman and occasional victim of similar harrassment. Still, it was a fun book."
2,"Not so ""Nice""","When I read the premise of ""Nice"" I knew I had to read it -- a girl who is too nice to dump her boyfriends so she kills them instead. It sounded wicked and funny but instead it was just...dull."
5,Miami Dolphins,This is another DVD covering my teams greastest moments.. Price was good and shipping quick. I would recommend this Seller
5,Love the scent.,My whole family loves this soap. Almond is our favorite. It smells great and makes us all feel clean. We highly recommend it.
1,What a soap burner!,I have sensitive skin.The soap start burning my skin after 20 minutes. I do not recommend it for people with sentive skin.
2,Bar of soap too big to handle!,"I bought this soap as the scent was nice. However, the bar itself is soo big to make it difficult to use & I cut the bar of soap in 1/2!J.L.F."
3,the print is flawed but the movie is great silly fun,first off the print looks kind of bad(maybe because of the age and the lack of care)so don't expect a great print.now if 50's space cheese is your thing this silly but fun trip to mars is just what you want. set in the year 2000(but still very 50's)this flight finds life and air on mars. the life forms are human and of corse they want to invade earth. you don't find cheese much better than this. sit back and enjoy!!!
4,Flight To Mars,"Was (is) exactly what I thought it would be, almost a comedy. Have watched it several times already and enjoyed it every time. I have always liked these old sifi stuff, the cornery it is the better. Very good service, delivery quite fast."
3,Funny stuff,"Having grown up with this stuff I really enjoyed the nostalgia, Many funny moments, sexy Martian women and great props. a little disapointed in the video and audio breakups, but just happy they could recover what they could."
3,Good fantasy Sci-Fi......Old style,"I don't know why, but I just like this movie. Most people would probably start snoozing after the first 10 minutes. The thing I like about this flick is it shows us how man in the mid-20th century believed space travel would be like. Their ""space suits"" are surplus WWII high altitude bomber clothing and oxygen masks. The martian suits appear to be left over from 'Destination Moon'. And this is the first space film that I've seen that the crew doesn't take any kind of weapon to protect themselves from the unknown. The film is kind of bland at times, but it does have its moments, especially the mini-skirts the martian gals wear (va-va-va voom). I've seen worse films, and I wish that MST3K would've done a lampoon."
4,Marguerite Chapman!!!!,"Some astronauts in WWII outfits crash-land on Mars after being knocked off course by a meteor shower. They find a race of beings who seem nice, but are actually bent on our extinction. Then, .... Ah, who am I kidding?? The only reason I like this movie is Marguerite Chapman (The Amazing Transparent Man) and her ten-foot long legs! My goodness gracious! She gets to strut about Mars in her blue mini-dress, causing me to stare transfixed at her every move! Praise the Lord! Ms. Chapman is a true wonder of nature! Had I been one of the earthlings, I'd have fallen at her martian high-heels and...., well, you get the picture. Is it hot in here??..."
3,Wouldn't purchase this again,"Video quality fairly poor, with artifacts in the image and less than terrific overall image quality. There is a ""blob"" in the middle of the image that comes and goes."
1,The Shield Brain Storm,"'Okaaay guys, great work so far. Time for a recap. Now, we've got the male protagonist: Dirty Harry-meets-Mussolini, we've got the Ambitious Latino Police Captain, the Righteous African-American Detective (civil rights background: maybe the dad??? ) and we've got the Big Idea.' 'Yeah Steve, go ahead'. 'Okay... I say, let's put in a cop named 'Dutch' (laughter) 'Sorry Steve, I don't think we will get away with that'. 'Well, maybe we can get Harrison Ford?' 'Steve...Steve, please, lay off the booze man... Now stay focused people: we're talking Blood, Lots of Blood, Violence in the Streets, Fascist Dirty Cops.. ideas anyone? Steve? 'Well, uh...Sex?' 'Good one Steve! Great come-back there!'"
4,Great Show/Great Service,"The TV series ""The Shield"" was great. I ordered season 3 from Amazon and received the DVD set in a few days at a great price. Couldn't be happier.The Shield - Season 3"
5,Perhaps one of the greatest police dramas ever!,Perhaps one of the greatest police dramas ever! I'm actually saddened that this great show is no longer on the air. The Shield is a gritty police drama with lots of realism.
5,Excellent series,The Shield is a great series where you'll soon find yourself supporting the bad guys
4,The Shield: the complete 3rd Season,"I feel weird reviewing each season of this TV series individually. This third season obviously made me want to continue watching the series, always introducing new characters and situations of each. As usual for this series, the way you feel about each character may change surprising you. But none of the episodes are dull, thats for sure."
4,Another Hardcore Season!!!,"The Shield keeps getting darker and better. Every character has personal problems as they must also do their job at The Barn. Vic Mackey is having problems with his family. Captain Aceveda will become scarred for life, there is a lot of tension between Tavon and Shane. Dutch tries to find a rapist who picks elderly women, and much more. After the Strike Team stole the Armenian mob money, they try to hide it and keep it secret from everybody. When some of the money is stolen, they all suspect each other. I highly recommend THE SHIELD: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON!!!"
3,violent police drama,"The first 2 seasons were reasonably engaging because the characters were complex, doing some self-dealing while catching bad guys. This season there are more insonsitencies in the stories and it seems more violent just for the sake of being violent, not to advance any story-line. If police drama's are your thing you will enjoy this, but it is dark and disturbing."
3,Loved I & II but III is Disappointing!,"The Shield is by far the best show on TV and I loved Season I and II but as I watched Season III, I kept waiting for those ""moments"" that only the Shield can deliver. Each time an episode ended, I waited for the great drama. Sadly, they only came once or twice.I watched the season finale for Season II probably 50 times because it was that good. I hoped that the finale for Season III would make up for the less than spectacular previous 14 episodes. I was disappointed! What was the finale? Vic and Shane having an argument. Extremely disappointing finale and season!"
5,The Best Cop Drama Ever,I recieved my order in a timely manner. It was securley packaged and in Great condition
5,"Superb and engrossig ""guerilla"" filmmaking - not to be missed!","The very best in edgy, dramatic tv that creates a ""world"" cast with utterly believable characters played by actors so damn good that you suspend disbelief virtually immediately and do so for the entire 6 seasons!I enjoyed this series more than any other (including ""The Sopranos"" and ""The Wire""!)I watched all of the episodes from all 6 seasons over a period of about 3 months and this concentration without commercials undoubtedly added to my enjoyment - but make no mistake this is a series that takes edgy turns that challenge us constantly!It is a brilliant piece of work!"
5,Still the Best,"The Shield is by far and away the best cop show on TV, if not the best overall show on TV. Tough, gritty, shocking and powerful, my only regret is that this is not a 22 episode show. 13 episodes a season just doesn't cut it."
4,This is no ordinary police drama,"'The Shield' is easily one of the best shows on TV. The characters are not polarized into good and bad, everyone seems to just be a different shade of gray. The plots have a clever way of putting you in the position where you ask yourself ""what would I do?"", with many complex moral questions and dilemmas for the characters. The only negative about this collection is that it has been presented in Full Screen aspect ratio and the picture quality on the region 1 is not a clean as my local region 4, which was in Wide Screen, but only seasons 1&2 have been released here in Australia on DVD. To my knowledge all the episodes have been filmed Wide Screen so I'm not sure why it's in Full Screen on this collection, but that is how they were originally aired by FX."
4,I like the slogan......' Contience is a killer',"I first started watching The Shield from Series 3. Critics have said this was the weakest one of all, But it was good enough to get me hooked! I was sold on the series after just a few episodes, I then had to get series 1 & 2 as well! Its a good series to have with a few episodes more than the other series. I would suggest getting it, I doubt if there would be a few people who regret it."
5,Each season gets a little more complex,"I have yet to see The Wire, but of the little television I do watch- The Shield seems closest to the spirit of Homicide: Life On The Street. Each season slows down a little and gets that much more complex. Definitely worth a look.That said, I'm only coming out of review retirement to mention that the DVDs are intentionally kept in full screen format. Shawn Ryan, the creator, mentions in one of the DVD commentaries that wide screen would make the show look more like film and less like television, and as such feels it would distance the viewer from action. You know, we might notice how dead brilliant the camera work on the show is, instead of just being swept along by the story. Even though the show is initially shot in wide screen, Ryan approves of the chop ups. So you may not like it, but the full screen format we get in the US is how the creator wants the show to be seen. Wow, that took way too long to write."
5,The Shield an Irish view.,"The only way to view this or most good tv series is by dvd box set because as they say on the pringles adverts ""once you start you cant stop"" More mayhem from vic and his motley crew although vic this time seems to be more like a policeman than a gangster, at last. There are loads and loads of shocks and twists along the way. Fantastic but totally unbelieveable in my opinion but then I live in Dublin and our police are not armed but that said, It is utterly brilliant television, great stories, superb acting and direction and excellent value for money also if you have not seen it buy The Wire also, another great police drama."
1,Sorry I bought it from TigerDirect,I got a fine picture but no sound on my desktop XP machine.I tried all the tweeks I could find on the Internet.Unable to download drivers from Leadtek website. Got nothing but voicemail at Leadtek with no response to the messages I left and no response to my email.Can't return it to the vendor(TigerDirect)without defective confirmation code from Leadtek. It pays to buy directly from Amazon.
1,Did I get bad unit?,"I purchased the USB version for my notebook, and based my decision on the other reviews that were good. However, I did not have the same experience. I am an advanced computer guy who was building computers in 1990, so I know how to follow directions. I also have a Gateway with a P4 2.13, and 1 Gig of Ram. I had to reload the program at least 4 times, and do a system restore. Then the TV would work, but not the FM. Tech Support was Ok. They gave me an update to download, and it fixed the problem. The next day, when I tried to record TV, after about 20 seconds the computer froze, and the program did not work again after many trials. Also, the mini-plug they put in the box, did not stay in the jack. I am sending it back, and have ordered a Hauppauge 1020 WinTV USB. A little simpler, and hpefully less buggy. I just want to watch TV on my computer and record a little."
2,It worked fine only if you never touch it,"This deluxe worked perfectly until one day, you accidentlyunpluged the usb cable, and plug in a different port.Then a lot of things broke. no matter how you tweak, the soundwill never be the same. it will produce noise, or be totallymute. This is an EXTERNAL device, so it's very possible youplug it in a different port. went to their website, they seemeven remove the link to download driver. My only solution tothe sound problem was a completely clean reinstall of windowsXP! after several times frustration, I have not been using itfor quite a while. bad investiment.UPDATE:GOT MY NEW COMPUTER WITH GEFORCE GRAPHIC CARD, THIS BOXWORKS WITH GEFORCE PERFECTLY. VERY SATISFIED WITH THE VIDEOQUALITY. MY PREVIOUS ATI CARD DIDNOT PRODUCE AS GOOD QUALITY IMAGEAS THIS GEFORCE CARD"
3,USB still not great for video capture,"It's ok, offers alot of capture options. Whatever codecs you have installed on your computer you can capture to.For just watching TV it is fine... but the captures are not up to par.Drops frames on anything higher than 320x240 resolution.I would get a PCI version instead for capture."
2,too bad...,"okay.. I liked ""Holy Target"" just as the next death/black metal fan did, but this? nah.. not quite for me. I mean I can only assume these guys were extremely bored and felt like goofing off when they recorded this stuff. musically, it isn't half bad, but sounds very 80s-retro-riff-...to me, but so many bands do that these days... The lyrics though... my god... they are some of the cheesiest most ridiculous you could ever hear. And, unfortunately, since the vocalist is rather coherent with his Mille Petrozza-like vocal style, you actually will hear them... I can only assume that they MEANT to sound this cheesy... Maybe just for fun, but nonetheless, I advise you to skip this goof-ball release and buy ""Holy Target"" if you want to sample this band."
3,Is this the same band?,"I don't know what these guys are trying to do.""Holy target"" is a death-black metal machine. Considered the new Dissection by their laber Nuclear Blast. It's incredible how strong these guys sounded in their first effort. Now, they still sound strong. But they change the blood, malevolence, high-speed-black metal songs for leather, steel, girls(see the cover), and Manowar-like compositions(I love Manowar, but they never changed).It's OK for a band to change. But not like this. You'll find fast songs like ""Not dead yet"", but forget to find something as wild, savage, brutal as ""Raise the devil"", ""Holy Target"" or ""Superior Powers""; you'll also find the semi-ballad ""Devilyn"". The only positive thing I've found are the vocals. This dude sounds as Mille Petrozza. So be aware!If you like death-black metal get ""Holy Target"". If you like Manowar or the new Megadeth get ""Not dead yet"" It's a shame what these folks did. They could have been great!!"
1,Sorry I bought it,"I have been to Corsica several times and wanted to buy a DVD that captured this island's beauty, but this DVD doesn't do this. First of all, it's like an amateur video that focuses most of the time in Ian Wright and not in the beautiful places that Corsica has to offer. Second, for someone who has never travel to Corsica it would offer no insight into the island. If I had the opportunity I would return it because we didn't even finish looking at it.On the other hand, I also bought and would much better recommend: Corsica: Ile de Beauté which gives you the images you expect in a travel video."
3,Globe trekker,Not bad if you are interested in this region. We were only interested in Sicily and it is only a very small part of this video.
3,Double Meaning,"A rather comedy is of a Japanese teens' quest for the ping-pong champion title, incorporating too much double-meaning while showing funny young-young-young male characters interacting and their single partner-short coaches.Too much drama round a ping-pong table surely."
1,Buyer beware,"I was totally shocked when my package arrived in the mail. It was a box that was at least 4 feet tall. Imagine my surprise when what I found in the box was long sheets that needed to be cut to size. This is not what was represented on the Amazon web site. I returned the product, but had to pay S&H. OVIS, the company that sent me this product told me that they do not refund S&H when they shipped what was ordered. Too bad they don't make it clear that the product comes in sheets that have to be cut down to fit your drawers."
4,good quality,"the 51"" spice rack is good quality and durable. It works well in my spice drawer. We didn't know that it comes in a very large box as one large piece. So we had a 51"" piece of plastic sitting in our garage until we could find the right tool to cut it and sand it. But it's perfect now and we still have some left over for another drawer. Just beware that this is not an expandable spice rack and you WILL have to cut it yourself, no tools included."
1,Drivers impossible to obtain,"They send the drivers on this unusable media that people quit using 10+ years ago (3.5"" disk)useless paperweight without the drivers on some type of readable media"
5,fianlly a Franklin doll!!!,"My two daughters are BIG Franklin fans. We started with the books and then beagan enjoying the animated series on Nickolodian. Now, Franklin's popularity has been somewhat replaced by Dora and Spongebob so the Franklin show has been moved to Noggin. I have been looking for a stuffed Franklin doll for three years - and finally we found one. This doll is well-made, looks just like the character, and will be a perfect addition to any family with fans of Franklin. I only wish we could have found it sooner! He's adorable and worth the price."
3,deceptive ad,"I now notice I am not the first to be taken in by this ad.. expecting a 14"" toy..it arrives in a little envelop. dimensions should be put in a location near the picture, not buried way way down under the books and other stuff. these little ones sell for $6.95 brand new rertail, and I paid $10 plus $3.99 shipping, so I paid twice what I should have for the same item. Not a good deal. $10 is a reasonable price for a 14"" toy and thats what anyone would expect. but he is still cute, and not worth the cost and hassle of returning it. and thats probably exactly what the seller is counting on.. By placing the size way down under ads for books she tricks buyers into paying way too much and not getting what they expect. The dimensions she refers to are actually listed as dimensions for the books."
3,Turtle franklin,This toys is nice for my 5 yrs old but i thought was more big dont mention it in the description but still a cute turtle.
1,Sleazy & Cheap,"I bought this pantsuit for a disco party and it was waaaay to trashy to wear in public. Not only was it see-through, but the fabric was really cheap and it hung poorly. It fit NOTHING like the picture.I think these are stripper clothes because that is the only way this outfit could be a viable or functional piece of clothing. Needless to say, I returned it."
3,Kidsongs-Very Silly Songs,This dvd is ok. Certainly not one of our favorites. My 12-month old son is crazy about all The Babysong dvd's by Hap Palmer. This one does not seem to engage him as much. Too many advertisements at the beginning which requires constant FF.
3,outstanding,My two year old boy enjoys watching it. He learns a variety of silly yet educational songs:)please continue your excellent service. There's no hassle on the shipping I received it in good condition.
5,Reliving the splendor,"The Roof is a darkly sensual song that finds Mariah reminiscing about a long ago encounter with a past lover on a rainy rooftop. ""Everytime I feel the need/I envision you caressing me/And go back in time/To relive the splendor of you and I/On the rooftop that rainy night"" is sung beautifully in MC's breathy whisper. Mobb Depp's The Shook Ones is sampled and they also rap on the extended mix. The Full Crew Mix is even better with a bit more bounce and a twinkly atmosphere. Love it!"
4,Excellent,"Well-written, well researched book on Seven Years War in a ""war and society"" type of format. Good military history, without getting bogged down in too much detail."
5,"Essentials of Stem Cell Biology, First Edition",The best for Stem Cell Biology for student or for someone who like to learn new things.
5,Excellent place to start,"This book is an excellent place to start if you're interested in stem cells. It covers just about all areas of research and is authoritatively authored by serveral experts in the field. The only caveat is that the field is changing so rapidly that some of the information in the book is a bit outdated (and of course, that's true of just about science text). However, you can quickly supplement the information in this book by getting more current research papers off pubmed or elsewhere. All in all, I think this book does provide an excellent foundation for getting into the field and understanding the basic science and its potential promise."
5,Excellent resource,I bought this book for a class I was taking and now find myself using it on a weekly basis as a resource for my job. It has all the update information you could possibly need to know about stem cell biology.
3,Required for Stem Cell graduate class at IUPUI,"Brand new condition! No problems with seller. Book was required for a class, but the text is slightly difficult to understand. Since it's an overview of concepts, the authors don't go into detail making the topics hard to understand on your own. However, the chapters are very short for a quick read!"
4,Good enough!,"Carlos Ponce is a good latin POP artist. I'd rather hear his music than Ricky Martin's, Luis Fonsi's and even Enrique Iglesias'!Not only is he a GREAT lookin' guy but he's just good at what he does musically.This is a complete compilation of his music. Highlights include Escuchame (with some flamenco guitars thrown in for good measure), Busco una mujer (a tropical song a la albita style), mujer con pantalones, and recuerdo.Worth checking out if you're into good latin pop music."
5,This book was in excellent condition!,"I actually purchased it for a friend, he wasn't sure wether to get it in school or online. I finally convinced him to get it online and he was facinated at the prices and the condition it was in! Great book."
4,Good Camera,"a good camera with a good wide angle lens. very good choice to spend your money on. pictures come out ""picture perfect!"""
3,Alma Mater!,"I was amazed they have this movie! First off when I first saw it I wasn't impressed because I'm not into horror. But what no one knows is that it was filmed in Willoughby Ohio, where The Andrews School For Girls, a boarding school which I went to and graduated in '78 the same time this movie was done, is! I believe one of our teachers,(which I didn't have) an art teacher(Mr. Kelly) was one of the extras.None of the outside did I recognize as my old campus but perhaps it was filmed on a part of the campus I never frequented. Perhaps any other Andrews Alumnus is out there who remembers this movie?"
5,Top Notch thriller,"Stop looking for the complete mini series, as it was never released on video. Yes this was a mini series, and I originally saw this when it aired on TV back in the late 70's. I have also seen the full 2-hour version which is the only version released by MCA for VHS.I don't understand all the negativity. This movie is fine in the 2 hour release. Take a look at the number of people buying it, and see the price at which it sellers. In my opinion, there were somethings that could have been edited out anyway. If you never saw the miniseries, you will never know what it was. In the 2-hour version, the story has continuity & is definitely enjoyable.I just recently purchased this, and am very satisfied with it. Don't hesitate to buy this video!"
2,This was a bad representation of Paganism,While I am a huge horror fan I did not like this movie. They took what is a beautiful Pagan ceremony and turned it into something ugly. I would like to just once see a movie that correctly represents what Paganism is.
5,"Now this is my favorite movie, and favorite version","As my title indicates, this version is easier to watch than the mini series version(which is not available anywhere).BESIDES WHO WANTS TO SIT THRU A MOVIE 4-5 HOURS LONG?This is exactly what this movie needed. Condensed into a a one-time viewing length movie. Having seen both versions, I can attest that the movie continuity flows coherently, minus the extraneous peripheral incidents.I prefer this version.-CDW"
4,Wish this was available on DVD,"Actually, I was so irate at the editing for the VHS version that I wrote to the studio years ago to find out why they cut so much out of it and was told that if an actor doesn't sign on to allow for certain advertisement, everything in the movie that they were in has to be cut out, which is why the entire story about the daughter's bf was chopped out. He doesn't appear in the VHS version at all. I still gave it 4 stars for the story itself."
2,CUT TO SHORT,I would rate it a five (5) if the entire 4 hours was on the tape. This version had to much cut out of it. Maybe if it is released on DVD we can get the whole version.
1,Wait for the DVD,"This is the worst editing job ever. The movie makes no sense. Rosanna Arquette's part was practically cut out. Michael O'keefe's character was totally cut out. As a result of this hack job, the relationships between the characters are non-existent. I hope whoever decides what to put on DVD listens and brings this out uncut as it should be seen. I live close to the town where all the scenes on the common where filmed and remember when they made this movie. This version does it no justice."
3,A LITTLE DISSAPOINTED,"WELL, HAVING SEEN THE MINI-SERIES AND READ THE BOOK, I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO OWNING THIS TRULY CHILLING STORY. ALAS, IT WAS ALSO THE VERY WATERED-DOWN VERSION,,,GOOD CHARACTERS MISSING,LEADING UP TO A DO-ABLE BUT UTTERLY SUB-STANDARD CONCLUSION. CONSIDERING THE AUTHOR IS DEAD, I AM SURE HE IS TURNING IN HE GRAVE AT THE INJUSTICE TO HIS WONDERFUL STORY. I CAN ONLY COMPARE IT TO ""THE SHINING"",,MOVIE VERSION OF STEPHAN KING'S WONDERFUL BOOK HOLLYWOOD RUINED. GREAT ACTORS THOUGH. SO THEN WHAT DID THEY DO? A GOOD MINI-SERIES WITH MEDIOCRE ACTORS. FOR ALL THEIR MONEY AND KNOW-HOW, ONE WOULD THINK THEY COULD GET IT RIGHT.FOR MY MONEY, I RECOMMEND ""LADY IN WHITE"", AND ""THE CHANGELING""ENJOY!SHARON GIBBS"
2,Quality requires time!,"The purpose of mini-series is to develope plot, characterzation, setting, etc. It is understandable that one should not attempt to watch a series in an evening. Having been a religion specialist & cult consultant for over 25 years, my special interest in Dark secret of harvest home is its trememdous religious background, unquestioned belief systems, the charismatic widow Fortune, the slow insidious breakdown of family unity until the full acceptance of the Religion of the corn! Weird & fun! But only the uncut version will do justice to the film. PLEASE....MAKE IT UVAILABLE ON DVD!!! RJ"
1,"Ruined, ruined, ruined!!!","This was such a scary, creepy movie. I saw it when I was in my early teens. (Spoiler) I thought a real scary scene was when Nick goes to see the sick Jack Stump, then finds out his tongue was cut off by the Widow Fortune as punishment. I had nightmares for days. So many important scenes are missing. Heck, half of the story is missing. A waste of time and money."
1,Read the book instead,"I was very disapointed with this movie. They took a 4-6 hour miniseries and chopped it into a 2 hour movie. They cut the whole daughter story line out, which took out half of the plot and made what was left a pale and poorly made farce of the books story. With half of the plot gone it makes it very confusing and unenjoyable.I recorded this movie/miniseries off of the TV years ago and was glad to get a prerecorded version. Well I hope my recorded version lasts a long time.I hope they release it on DVD, but as the complete item and not this butcher job."
1,"""Where's the beef?""",Why would you take a fine eerie mini-series like this and cut it in half and think that it would hold together as a story or that people wouldn't be upset by it. This cries out for a DVD release and i'll give it a proper review of it then. Till then skip this poor stepchild.
2,Needs to be on DVD,"I watched this movie when I was 13yrs. old, when it came on T.V. I would really like to purchase it on DVD. Please consider releasing it on DVD.The whole mini-series not just bits and pieces of it. Betty Davis is Excellent in this movie. You would really have a lot of people interested in owning this on DVD. I definitely would purchase if on DVD.Thank-you,Scarlet Hogue"
4,needs to be on DVD,I agree.This would sell on DVD. It is a classic.Very creepy.Scared me to death!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,The dark secrets of Harvest Home,This is a movie that I really like and I have seen the entire movie several times in the past. In the movie that you sent to me there are vital parts that are cut out of the movie. For instance the part where Tamar tempts the womans husband and rolls around in the mud. That part is cut out of your movie and there is no real understanding why the wife doesn't like Tamar. Also there is no understanding why the husband avoids Tamars little daughter because the parts where the child plays finger string with him and the other part about the child screaming are cut out of your movie. I know that there is a copy of the full version of this movie and I was hoping that you had it since your movie cost me $50.00 some dollars. If you have the full version of The dark secrets of Harvest Home please send it to me and I will return the movie that you sent to me back to you.
2,PLease restore the Full Mini-series,"Please, dear powers that be, restore this cult classic to it's full lenght and release it on DVD.It was a great book, a great mini-series and one of Bettie Davis' last great performances."
3,dark secret of harvest,cut alot out of this movie on video.was much better on tv.amount of money spent on this video felt cheated.
2,Dark Secret of Harvest Home.,"This product was badly packed. Shabbily sent in a reinforced envelope. Quality of DVD was poor, and practically unwatchable.Seller notified, and offered to send me another DVD, free of charge, from a list he sent me.I declined, as this movie was one I selected, and had no interest in his other suggestions.Regards,Andy Bowman"
1,Do NOT buy this movie!,"This wonderful 1978 TV mini-series is an all-around classic on many levels. It is not only a time-capsule of 1970's TV film-making, but it is an excellent adaption of Thomas Tyron's book. If you remember watching this movie on TV around the fall as a child, you will be terribly disappointed by the hatchet job done to this movie on the video store version. Not only have great scenes been cut out, but so much has been chopped the story is intelligible. Here's what the video is like:Wow! Look at those people in old fashioned clothes farming!Wow! Let's buy an old house here!Hey! I don't think I like it here very much. Let's move!No! This is where I am staying!Wait! Stop! No! Please no!The end.Roll credits.Hideous. If you honestly want this movie, I suggest going to horror conventions and/or keeping an eye out at online auctions. The full 185 minute version can be found there ranging in price.... Pricey yes, but it is a true find for the die-hard horror collector."
1,A Great MiniSeries Ruined By the Editing,"A Great, suspenseful and very interesting miniseries, completely ruined by the editing and the moron ""Ce"" who thought it was good would also like to see the one hour version of Gone With The Wind!There is no way to cut Harvest Home and make it play smoothly and with effectiveness. The entire subplot of the new Harvest Lord was edited out of this cut. That took the heart and much of the suspense and evil out of the movie. As the other reviewers with some brains, I await the full , uncut version. The uncut version would be a very high quality collector's edition. It is the only one worth buying.This cut version is too poorly edited to send out for free."
2,THIS IS A FIVE STARS MINI SERIE,"I purchased the VHS version and was extremely disappointed by the extensive cuts performed on the tape. Where is the Worthy story, he is an integral part of the story....what was left wasnot worth watching. I only watched the tape once, when I received it. Bring the entire story on DVD"
2,How Disappointing,"I have been reading the reviews and have chosen not to buy this ""edited"" version based on reader reviews. This was a TV mini-series that my siblings and I loved as a child. We are huge Bette Davis fans and loved this ""original"" and clever mystery/horror made-for-TV movie. I cannot imagine why anyone would have cut it up. But if it ever does go on DVD in it's full uncut glory, please e-mail me!! I'll definitely buy it then."
2,Cut up too badly!!,"I saw this movie on tv years ago and even though I had to sit through the commercials, the film was shown in in full. Not cut to pieces like this VHS version. This movie should be released on a double DVD version so as to not cut all the meaning out of it. Betty Davis would roll over in her grave if she saw this version of the movie."
1,Will not get Harvest Home -cut and on VHS,I just read all the reviews and will not purchase Dark Secrets of Harvest Home. I read the book a few times and watched the series on TV-it was fantastic. Like all your reviewers I hope someone out there will put the whole series on DVD. I will be waiting. I am going to purchase the book again from one of your sellers on Amazon-as I lent it to someone years ago and (of course) they never returned it.Hey a lot of fans would really really like to see this series uncut and on DVD. We are waiting.
3,Dark Secret of Harvest Home,"I saw the mini-series way back, but have never seen a rerun on TV. I think it is about time to release an uncut version of this. I remember it as being very good, compared to the horrible Wicker Man that was recently released and is a joke, laughable, and is poorly acted, directed, and scripted. It was such a ridiculous copy of Harvest Home (the book and the mini-series) with none of the intricacies."
1,dark secret of harvest home vhs,"i was very disappointed in this product. the movie was not complete, there were important characters cut out and 2 hours cut out of the oridinal movie"
4,Great sound,"Great sound, for the price! No complaints on the seller. I WISH however that it would CHARGE your i-pod, but no such luck. And, as others have mentioned, the ""craddle"" (holder) for the i-pod is a waste of plastic, really.I took back a 40.00 system that sounded HORRIBLE, and ordered this instead. (My son got his @ Wal-mart, but I could never did them there)"
2,Very difficult to turn on and off,"What I hate about these speakers is that you can't turn them on and off from your desk. The switch is awkwardly placed behind the subwoofer which they suggest putting under your desk. Everyday I have to crawl under my desk, then feel behind the subwoofer for a switch I can't even see. Other Altec Lansing speakers have an on off switch on the actual speakers so I don't know why they did this. I wish I had bought different speakers it such a pain turning them on and off."
4,$29.99 for easier to hold footed dishes,"As the summer approaches, we are eating more berries with gelatin and it is easier to hold a footed dish in one hand and the spoon in the other than to use a bowl and spoon. These are not very big."
4,Informative and Accurate Account of Politcal Journalism,"Fallows does a great job of using simple language to convey the complex issues that introduce themself in political journalism. He is surely looking out for the best interests of the public and the values of American democracy in this text. Reading this book will make you a more conscientious citizen, voter, and newspaper reader. The facts that he reveals about journalism should be known by all, and he writes with genuine concern for the state of a fragile American democracy and tainted political journalism. I would reccomend it for both academic and entertainment purposes."
4,Interesting New Take on Something We Already Know,"The author has done a superb job of researching this treatise on a media out of control. Many we illustrative examples are given to prove the author's point and the writing style is good as well.Between what is presented here and listening to the pundits who spout at the mouth along their own agendas in the radio, it is difficult for anybody to ever figure out what is fact and what is what someone wants things to be. Very thought provoking!"
3,An apposite book for contemporary news and information.,"The book is both absorbing with nice bits of relevant information and thin with anecdotes that do not support or follow his thesis. It's good for bedtime reading and water cooler talk (such as how CNN's Crossfire and the McLaughlin Group are staged to create conflict; or how the integrity of the journalistic elite should be questioned). In addition, Fallows' message could have been expressed in half the number of pages. The irony of his book is that he censures the media et al. for lack of substance and flippant attitudes, but his book does not have any more or less substance than the medium he's criticizing."
3,good book but not his best work,"Fallows is very smart and an excellent writer. This book is very good but I do not believe it to be his best work. However, this is an important part of any survey or recent books on the large problems within the US media."
5,Among the clearest stitch diagrams,"Pauline Brown is a real expert on needlework and you can't go wrong with this book. Her chapters include: Surface embroidery, Needlepoint, Counted thread embroidery, Metal thread, Machine embroidery, Appliqué, Quilting and Other Techniques. In all, I think there are more than 100 different stitches. I included a picture of the back cover, an example of how clear the directions are (with knotted insertion stitches) and the inside front title page.I have hundreds of needlework books and other encyclopedias or dictionaries I find useful include:Mary Thomas's Dictionary of Embroidery StitchesThe New Dictionary of Counted-Thread Embroidery StitchesEncyclopedia of Embroidery Stitches, Including Crewel (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)Stitch Sampler: The Ultimate Visual Dictionary to Over 200 Classic Stitches"
4,Necessary study for Calvinists,The Westminister Confession of Faith is one of the rocks that support Calvinist based denominations. For it's time period the English is very easy to understand. I like to read a selection every day along with my other devotionals. All of it is tied to scripture thus affirming its validity.
4,A good book for a high school student,"Jay Parini's book is a good book for a high school student. The wide array of examples and explanations help guide a beginning poetry reader through the jargon in a clear and conise way. The book can be useful as a reference or to read through back-to-back. I consider it a good ""textbook"" for getting to know what poetry is about."
3,Pay attention to the dimensions,"I have not yet put this to use outdoors yet, but need to comment on the size. If you plan on using this with a cot, be aware that it is basically the dimensions as a standard cot. Whether you build a pvc frame or tie it off from trees/posts, when you sit on the edge of your cot you will be right up against it. Keep in mind that if it is a little windy, the net will blow into you and minimize the effective space even more.No knee space so to speak of. It seems to be a well made product and will try to remember to post an update once it is actually used outdoors (2 more weeks). Mainly, pay attention to the dimensions and compare with whatever you are going to be sleeping in or on.. My preference, is to buy the double size for a few bucks more and be more comfortable. Happy Camping !!!"
4,"i ordered the wrong size, but no problem returning","The product looked totally fine, but I ordered the wrong size and had to return. Wanted to post a review b/c the customer service at Kegworks was great and they processed my return in a timely fashion."
4,Works Fine Easy to program,No problem with installation. I use it in a refinished attic that does not need to be heated or cooled at night.Flat flush mounting looks good.
3,"Battery hog, not reliable","I love the idea of this thing. But it chews through batteries regularly, and one of the two I have will not open/close reliably."
2,Extremely displeased,I am an American In Ireland. If I wanted a long winded interview about the Giants I can watch the BBC. They're great at it.
2,very surprising 2 set,I didn't read the ad carefully and found it was the 1986 and 1990 superbowl and not superbowl XLII. Wasted my money.
4,A good source,"This volume is a good introduction into the complex issue of aquaculture sustainability. It is an important reference to have. It covers many different topic areas, and does a fairly good job at that. The one drawback it it is already becoming dated - at only 5 years! Well worth the read."
1,Don't do it!,"Don't buy this product. It sucks. You have to be less than two feet from the stereo for it to work without having noisy static, and the music overpowers the vocals that you are trying to belt out!"
1,Karaoke mike for iPhone,Not too good. Sounds like someone is way off in the distance trying to sing over your voice.
3,"Good, but voice cancelling could be improved","This is a good, fun device that allows for a lot of fun with the whole family! The only problem is that it could do better at cancelling the regular singers voice and making yours louder."
1,Useless,Do not buy this product. It does not work as advertised. If I could only get my money back on this I would.I already lost it because it would not work so I set it aside. Do not waste your money on this one. I would noteven take this one if it was given to me.
3,misleading,this is a little misleading...it makes u think u can do this right from your ipod but it goues through a stero system...daughter was disappointed
3,It's best when using real karaoke files,"I'm using kJames on my Mac to convert mp3/cdg files to Quicktime mp4 files. With that and a video iPod, I get a true karaoke experience and the iKaraoke works great. In my experience, vocal cancelling never really works so I expected nothing more from this. However with true karaoke files, I think you'll be pleased. We used the iKaraoke on a car trip today, and it was a blast. I only wish there were built-in mic level controls on the microphone."
1,Be Wary...Doesn't work with iPod Touch even tho others buy together,"Griffin made two versions of this both ending in 9757. The first version DOES NOT work with the Touch--in the packaging the connector is facing left toward the microphone. The second version DOES work with the Touch and is searchable on Griffin's website:[...]. The packaging shows the connector facing right away from the microphone and has a yellow label in the upper left corner. It also displays the Touch on the back for compatibility. I also verified with Griffin support that this earlier model does not work with the Touch.So even though you see both listed on this link and that people have bought the items together, they do not work together."
1,Very limited in its performance,It suppresses vocals but not completely. On some songs it suppresses upto 80% but on most of the songs its not even 25%. It feels as if it dims the vocals and amplifies the music a little bit but this product is USELESS to be used for karaoke. The worst part is I can't even return it. I already paid 4.99 for shipping and I will have to pay pretty much the same amount to return it.
2,Narrow Ipod,It can't be used for Iphone Itouch and my newest nano... it is just fir for Ipod Nano first and second generation... I need to re-buy a nano for this pen!!!!!
2,No FM Transmission,"I bought this mainly for the FM transmission function, b/c my car audio is too old to plug-in an ipod. Even though the item page specifically says, and I quote, ""Send audio from your iPod to your stereo in either of the two different ways:wirelessly via FM transmission or through standard audio cables"". Well, there's only one option, an 12-ft audio cable."
1,Total crap!,"I purchased this (thankfully!) on the discount rack at our local superstore. I paid $12 for it - and I paid $10 too much. The reverb on it is distracting, the microphone gives poor sound quality and the jack doesn't stay in the iPod correctly and moves around. And it doesn't tell you that in order to actually HEAR music & record (at the same time) on your iPod - you have to hook up a speaker as well. Don't waste your money - invest in a crap quality karaoke machine with a jack you can hook up your iPod to...."
1,Do NOT Buy!,This product sucks. I got it for christmas and struggled to get it to work. It would not work with my itouch. Finally i got it hooked up to an iphone. However the home screens described in the instructions would never come up. I hooked it up to my stereo and eventually it worked a little. The ikaraoke did a terrible job of masking almost all songs i tried. It ended up making alien sounds for most of the songs. Talking into the microphone didn't even sound good on my stereo. Extremely disappointed and you can't even return it! For 40 bucks this product is a waste of money!
3,Good for price,"Like others have said, this doesn't really work well with songs that do not have the vocals on a different layer of the track; more often than not it would just dim the entire song and make the entire song sound fuzzy. I prefer to use it purely as a mike since its fun to sing along with songs too. This is great for the price, didn't really expect much more. The FM transmitter came as a surprise to me, even though I haven't tried it out yet. This is probably one of the cheapest FM transmitters you will come across. Great for road trips."
1,Do Not Buy,"I thought this was going to be a really awesome gift for my niece, but turns out the product would not work on any of the Apple products it said it would work on. Tried troubleshooting on many websites, but still could not figure it out...I do not recommend buying this product at all! It was just a fail and a waste of money!"
2,Worst product from Griffin EVER,"The problem is that the microphone is WAY too sensitive...no...wait a minute...the problem is that the music that passes through it is horribly distorted... no... wait a minute.... the problem is that the controls are high, medium and low for reverb...and music... no wait a minute...the problem is that the feedback from the over sensitive microphone is nearly impossible to eliminate...no... wait a minute...oh hell...forget it...If you buy this product you will be VERY sorry. Griffin should pull this off the shelf immediately or risk never selling ANY other Griffin branded product. I'm quite certain that I won't be doing so."
1,WHOOPSI,"Dang. I Googled ""PC MIC ECHO REVERB"", wanting a microphone with echo chamber for my PC. Nothing came up but this. Being human, when I quickly scanned the overview, while pulling out my credit card, I saw qualities I wanted. I bought. It arrived.A microphone for an iPod, which I don't happen to own, nor do I need.Called Radio Shack. Can I get cables to link this up to my PC? Nope.Ah well.........guess the Grandson has a new toy."
3,iKaraoke,"This is not a bad little tech product to add to you list. It's fun to use; my wife and I sung songs in the car while going somewhere.The product is cool. The only negative, I see is that it doesn't fully mute the original singers voice. That's okay to me because, I probably need the original singer as my back up.The cost was not that much, so I didn't expect that I was actually get a Karaoke machine.On the other hand there's really no reason why they couldn't make the original singer voice muted, with todays technology."
3,ikareoke,"I like the thought of this item. It pretty much does what it says. The radio frequency is a little challenging to get good quality sound. When it ""minimizes"" the lead vocals, it minimizes everything making it harder to hear. I like it and will use it again, but I think there is room for improvement."
2,Good idea but needs work,"It's a great idea by Griffin but it doesn't really work that well. Your voice doesn't come out that well, and depending on where you live limits you to finding an fm channel (I live in Philly)"
3,Nothing Spectacular,"I'm sure there are a lot of awesome karaoke products out there, this is not one of them.I got this for my sister's birthday because we both love karaoke and it seemed like a cute idea. Sadly, it didn't work with half the songs... However, the songs it did work with worked good.I don't think I'd buy this again as a gift, but its fun to mess around with."
2,Only one boat,"This boat, not the collection of boats shown in the picture, is small and takes on water and begins to sink. Motor doesn't really propel it much and is hard for young kids to operate. I would not recommend this toy."
2,Not great at floating...,"So, it doesn't really float well and the propeller doesn't move the boat so well....So, can't recommend these boats Bought them because I had them as a kid. Thought they worked better back then. Wishful thinking..."
1,Don't buy it. Bad designing,"This toy does not work.. The water is too strong for the propellar to work. and the bottom is so shallow that it easily takes on water and sinks. My boy was soooo excited to see it and wanted to play, then was quite disappointed when it wouldn't work. It immediately went into the trash."
2,"To Little, To Expensive",I thought I was getting a more than just one of these little boats for $8. Not worth the price but is an ok toy. a $2 boat from Wal-Mart is just as good. The propeller barely moves the boat and it's hard for my 2 and 5 year old to wind it up without it going on hi before it hits the water. .
2,Mighty motor boat not so mighty,"What a disappointment! This was one of (3) new bath toys that I purchased for my five year old for tub time. All three were basically junk. In this case, the motor boat begins to sink as soon as it is in the water, and the wind up motor cannot propel the waterlogged boat forward...at all!"
5,yes yes very good,"Yeah i agree with all the other reviews this set is very good well explained and Master Sexton is really good teacher,this 3 dvd set is great value the teqniques a very good,and theres loads of them for the price its selling for.Anyone who buys this dvd set will love itGary Buontempo"
5,Worth The Money,"In this information he breaks down everything in a simple to follow format.It would be well worth the money.It did bring back memories of visiting master Steve Sexton's Hapkido school in Canoga Park CA In the early 80's. To watch him move and teach, It was very moving,and powerful, at the time Fariborz Azhakh was an assistant instructor.Devin Willis"
3,Not helpful,"I'm sure the instructor is quite good, and the techniques are fine. It's just impossible to practice hapkido on your own. If you want to learn it, great, but go to a school that teaches it. The DVDs aren't cheap, he does do a thorough job of explanation, sometimes too thorough, repitition is great for actual practice, but not while watching a DVD, one slow motion and one real speed would have been better. It's not like you can't replay it."
5,Unbelievable,We enjoyed this picture-story of a mother hummingbird. Excellent photographs and clear text. A book every (humming)birdlover will enjoy.
5,excellent,another great book to learn the habits of the hummingbirds though the are tiny they are toughj and do not seem fragile at all
3,new age,"The more I read this book, the more I realized that I was reading a book that gives more credence and power to angels than to God who created angels. I didn't finish reading it."
2,who says it works?,the smell is horrible and i do not feel any results of no pain. it does not work for me.
1,Product description not specific enough.,This product does not work on my computer that runs on Windows XP. The description should have mentioned that this product will not work on a Windows XP operating system. I just wasted my money since it doesn't even play.
3,Another Jimmy Morello Production.,"Can you play an instrument and sing but only have two or three songs to your name and no band? No problem! Just call producer/musician/songwritter/mixer Jimmy Morello at JSP.On this CD, Morello pens 8 of the 11 originals performed by Boals and assembles his usual cast of talented musicians to form a solid rhythm section supporting Boals.Th CD covers the blues gammet from straight blues to swing to jazz blues.Boals has produced four earlier CD's on his own label--Growlin Bare prior to his collaboration with Morello. All of these CD's are available here at Amazon. If you want to hear what a difference the talented Morello makes, pick up one of Boals self produced CD's and compare for yourself. As I have stated before, you usually get a fine CD from Morello/JSP and this disc is no exception."
5,A superb office tool,"This specialized label printer is simple to set up, easy to use, and takes up very little space on the desk - highly recommended.A few cautionary notes:1. when printing from Outlook the program only recognizes business addresses2. the thermal printing labels you must use with this printer aren't exactly cheap3. the template provided for use in Word reinstalls itself by modifying the default document template each time you open Word, which is annoying if you have Word set to notify you before saving the default template.Otherwise I am completely satisfied with this printer and expect to use it for many years."
5,Great on OSX,"Hi,I have a Powermac G4 and a powerbook + an airport express.This thing is great, it is plugged into the powermac. I just selected ""share printers"" from the System Settings menu.When we want to print a label we can do it from either computer in seconds. The Dymo software works well on the mac and we can print directly from address book."
5,Best little Label Printer in Texas (or anywhere),Easy to set-up and useGreat quality and speedvery flexible
3,Cute printer - Crappy software - Crappy help,Cute printer - Crappy software - Crappy help.That about sums it up. If they didn't screw their customers with crappy software and help one could recommend it without qualification.I'm on a Mac too and I'm also having trouble saving an address. Obviously the software is defective and Dymo has no problem selling defective products.Aggravating.
3,Not so fast... Incorrect product description.,"Quote from the product description: ""The LW330 also conveniently prints Internet postage with stamps.com.""Umm, not for Macintosh users it doesn't. Last I checked postage.com was Windoze only. Please correct the product description."
2,Enjoyable but a little too predictable,"I read this book, the 2nd in the series I think, after I'd read the first 'The Dream Catcher' and the third 'Enchanted By You'. I was very impressed by the first and liked the third one, but I was pretty disappointed with this one. The main female character was a little too vapid & annoying - could never make up her mind among other things. The plot was a bit too formulatic and didn't captivate my interest like the other books in the series. It would be better if you read the other two - I highly recommend them."
1,Not compatible with my printer,"This product was not compatible with my HP LaserJet 1000. There is no compatability list anywhere, even though it's referenced in the manual. This further reinforces my belief that Belkin products are not worth the time, money, nor effort."
3,As promised,"Limited knowledge, very good pics, accurate, useful. Don't spend but a couple of bucks for it since most other books contain more writing. Carry in the car."
1,eurotrashy,"a quite typical travel guide for the eurotrash tourist, pulls all the stops for parties, multicutural experiences, politically correct blabber, and little or no geology, science, history."
5,Excellent Concert,"This is a brilliant Concert by Carman. Excellent songs, dances and exciting messages and GOD Almighty gets all the glory too. Been watching this superb DVD again and again. Don't miss this gem of a DVD. Highly recomanded to Christians and non-Christians alike. You will love this."
5,Mary's Review,"I enjoyed Carman's style of music, which is several styles. I purchase this DVD a month ago. I have watched it several times since. I often watches his video's on YouTube. He is one of my favorite Artist. I can feel the sincerety throught his Arts and music. He is also very anonited, I can discern that through his speaking and singing when he is in the spirit when watching his performance on stage in his videos."
4,A big chunk of funny!,"Nobody told me how funny this guy was until I actually viewed this concert on DVD. I hadn't seen him in person before so I didn't realize how much time he spent chatting between songs. He's quite funny. In fact when he recounted the George Carlin joke about ""Yogurt"" I just almost sprayed yogurt through my nose I laughed so hard. He's quite the comedian this Carman fellow."
5,Smart Attack,"Bought this for a long car trip in hopes the kids would be partially entertained. I have twins aged 7 and needed lots of activities to keep them amused. Smart Attack did the job, the kids loved the trivia and dad (me) was happy to have a few hours where I didn't have to be screaming at them to keep their hands off one another. This is a simple but effective idea for kids in elementary grades. Thanks!"
5,Wow.,"I heard Mr. Brook on Weekend Edition, thought he sounded like a great guy and I wanted to support him and his new album he spoke so eloquently about. RPS, as I call it now, came a couple days ago, and this might be a bit cheesy, but I believe this album to be magical. Somewhat a musician myself I am amazed at the seamlessness and gorgeousness of transitions every time I listen to any piece on this record. Brook very masterfully goes from electric guitar to an orchestra to a Bulgarian choir and it's so great that 1. I wish I had written it and 2. why doesn't everyone put a Bulgarian choir on their album!? It's just really beautiful. I can't even pick my favorite piece because honestly my answer changes every time I listen to it.Supposedly this new album is a slight departure from previous works, if other online reviews are to be believed, and if it is, it is a departure to beauty and lushiness and exquisite detail that is so very worth listening to."
3,Not Michael's best,"Overall RPS is a good listen but it is not Michael's high water mark. For my taste Mr. Brook excels in the cerebral atmospheres he creates and the fertile ground he lays for other artists to play in. The lyrics for the title cut, which to me is the low point on the disc, are nothing short of puerile and the Resurrection of Nusrat Fateh Ali Kahn for some background vocals is dubious at best."
4,Fungus Among Us,"Once more we are in Ambergris. Siblings Janice and Duncan Shriek are the prime movers of this tale of above- and below- ground unreality. The book does not ever resolve fact from fiction - or whether either term has meaning in this constructed world. But, the book is about the cracks in reality.Readers of VanderMeer are well aware that he cannot use fifty words instead of three times that many to describe anything. There were many times when I suffered a whiplash from 'haven't I already read that paragraph?'. Sure enough, I had (almost) many times. But, that is the method of telling this story; linear has a slightly less than real meaning, too.The author is inventive, clever and witty. The story is a mixture of genres, so rather than trying to categorize it, I'll just file it under 'different'. This is not a good starting place for VanderMeer. I'd recommend starting with 'City of Saints & Madmen""."
1,Uck! With a capital U,"I'm not a squeamish person. I often enjoy dark fiction and seldom read anything other than SF. BUT, I found this book repelent. I've tried to read it 2 or 3 times but it makes my skin crawl and not in a good way. I've never gotten beyond the first few chapters. If you decked to read it, good luck."
1,Good book for insomniacs,"I've been racking my brain to try and remember if I ever read a book more boring than this one. Nope. I had to put it down after slogging through 100 pages, and it took me a week to get that far because I would fall asleep after 10 minutes of reading. Lately I've been reading some really good books by George Alec Effinger, Jonathan Carroll, and Kage Baker among others. Reading the reviews this book seemed in the same vein, so I ordered it. I'm really glad it cost less than $3, since I am going to burn it to keep it from harming anyone. May cause drowsiness, do not read while operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle."
3,Lack luster book,"I find it hard to explain why I was so disappointed in this book. Perhaps it is the redundancy of subjects(cherries), yet the cherry part was interesting in the fact that it compared a same subject with different techniques. Still it lacks something.The other examples of pictures that were in the book were overwhelming for me. It is as if I were already expected to know how to draw the pictures. I did not find there to be enough step by step instruction.I also have another book by Gary Greene- Textures. That book is far more inspiring and instructional than this one is.This book just does not whet my appetite for watercolor pencils enough to make me want to race to my pencils and start drawing right away. Instead, it just makes me sigh, and put the tin away for yet another day.This topic could be covered in a far more inspirational and effective way than was done in this book. And the examples should be more exciting and motivating than they are."
4,A 'One of a Kind' Book!,"If you've been digging around for any tips and techniques on Watercolor (water soluble) pencils, look no further! The market needed a book on this 'hidden treasure' medium and this is it. This book is very thorough, beginning with the different qualities of each watercolor pencil brand, step-by-step directions on 13 different techniques, concluded with demonstrations of these techniques by numerous watercolor pencil artists. Have fun with this medium (and this book)!"
1,enough with the cherries,I purchased this book expecting challenging and wide ranging examples of this medium. What I got was endless pages of 2 cherries done over and over when these samples exploring technique could have fit on 2 pages and given room for more challenging examples. This book is a bust.
3,Not quite,"Not quite what I was looking for. As an absolute beginner in this medium, it is not quite inspiring and I am still lost. It says apply derwent deep, madder carmine and geranium lake...how do I apply? It does not say one colour first, then add next colour on top. This happens throughout the book. Maybe when I have gotten real instructions on ""how to..."" then I will be able to appreciate this book."
4,Smooth and Chocolatey,"I used to drink over 4 cups of coffee a day but not anymore! For the past 6mnths, I drink a cup of yerba mate tea in the morning & I feel great. I don't miss the burning stomach or the edginess from coffee. I highly recommend that you give it a try."
5,Wonderful Tea,"I was a little skeptical of a chocolate tea, but having started a diet I thought I'd give it a try. This tastes great with a little added sweetener. Doesn't make up for not having the real thing, but I liked it so much I just ordered the 6 pack box!"
5,Something that tastes good that is good for you!,"The first time I made Pixie mate chocolate mate solstice I used water, microwaved it and didn't like it much. Then I decided to make the tea following directions on a Chia tea box, letting it steep 10-15 minutes. I made it with rice milk and sweetened it with Stevia and a little maple syrup. It was DELICIOUS! Friends gave me this tea so i googled it to find out where to buy it."
3,"You have to read it, to believe it","The Hunt for Zero Point takes you on a journalists' quest to find truth in a matter that could change the world. Nick Cook explains his informational journey through the past and present knowledge of anti-gravity technology and Z.P.E. The book gets its' suspense from the ever nearing date of Nick's sabotage in the journalist world, or his silencing by the government. Even with the suspense, drama, dialogue, and the threat of failure removed the data alone would prove Nick's point, and the point of many who walked the lines as he did. Wrestling with the past while fighting the future Nick goes from a nose-dive to a perfect landing in his wonderful story of de-classification and realization of the many unknown technologies of the present."
1,Thanks for the Warning,"OK, I got to page 40 and decidecd it was time to check and see if it was worth continuing. Guess not! I was hoping to learn about past research into anti-gravity, regardless of its outcomes, but it was looking more and more like a ""Gummamint K-O-N-spiracy"" book with each passing page. Glad I borrowed it from the library! It's too bad, it could have been interesting. As far as I know, the scientists still have no real model for gravity (gravitons? superstrings? c'mon, maybe it's just ether on the grassy knoll)."
1,"Lots of blah, blah, blah, blah....",How can you write 300+ pages and not say anything?That is this book summed up.I kept thinking he has to reveal something soon and then the book was over with nothing really being said.
1,Reader Beware,This could have been a great book but the author and/or publisher seem to have chosen to use it as an exercise in how much profanity and how many obscienities they could get away with in a book of this type before someone complains. This rendered the book unreadable for me. I don't appreciate being treated like a dungbug. Even people interested in such things as anti-gravity still have some moral standards. There are other authors out there who still have some respect for their readers values and give virtually the same information in their books even though they didn't work for Jane's. The only reason this review has a rating of 1 is that's the lowest rating Amazon will allow. I'm returning my copy of this book and spending my money elsewhere. (publisher's please note)
5,Very interesting,"It's a very interesting reading, actually almost a thriller. The author provides a lot of historical facts, his own adventures, thoughts, investigations - however, most of the questions he poses still remain unanswered after you close the back cover of the book, but nevertheless, it's enjoyng to read the book!"
4,A Military Pilots Perspective,"My father was the first Chief Test Pilot for the Navy, at the first commissioned flight test facility at Trenton Naval Air Station, in New Jersey during WWII. He taught me how to fly. I flew helicopters with the Army for several years. I have seen an unidentifiable object move through the air with such maneuverability and acceleration to know it was not flying by any conventional means I was aware of. After reading Nick' s book, my perspective has been broaden, and feel better having a more terrestrial explanation for my observation. I am not a scientist, so I have the leisure to make myself feel more secure. I was hoping for a more definitive conclusion to the Zero Point question. I think what was presented leaves me solidly between beyond a reasonable doubt and 100% certainty."
5,Good,"It seems the author is an authorized journalist on the aerospacial industry. Even though he wrote like a personal journey towards the truth, the book gives real clues on secret but real technology wich, if used, would change the society. One must think a lot after reading. Very good information."
3,The hunt was almost successful,"You will enjoy this book if you:(1) have considered becoming an investigative journalist. Nick Cook provides a close up view of what an investigative journalist does -- including satisfactions and disappointments.(2) are fascinated by World War 2.(3) would like to get a feel for how governments manage, protect, and pursue top secret advanced technology innovation.You will be disappointed in this book if you:(1) prefer to see endings where a quest is achieved.(2) expect to learn many insider secrets about exotic new energy breakthroughs.(3) already know all you want to know about WW2.If learning more about breakthrough energy technology itself is your main interest, then you're better of to use an Internet search engine with the phrase ""zero point""."
3,It could have been much better.,"Nick Cook who writes and edits for Jane's Defence had a good premise for this book. Has anyone discovered Zero Point Energy and its offshoot, anti-gravity? Ultimately, Cook doesn't really prove anything. He covers the history of the Nazi's secret technology projects during WWII at some length. It becomes clear that the US government had obtained this information and has since buried it away in numerous black projects. The one item that sticks in my mind is how Cook was so close minded about the technology he was seeking. His take was if it didn't show up in a technical journal, then the technology was highly suspect to him. He changes his tune towards the end of the book, but his mantra throughout the book is if anyone brings up the term ""anti-gravity"", they should be questioned for their sanity. The book should be read as a story about how our government operates in secrecy and we can never know the full truth about anything they might tell us."
2,Not very good,"Having a great beginning, my expectations were high above this book. As an investigating journalist, he should have went much deeper, ...or tell us so. It has no place in your favorite 1000 books collection. Prefer authors like Jim Marrs, Ryan Wood, Tim Good, Stanton Friedman."
3,Great fiction!,"I'm giving this book three points, but only for the author's considerable skills as a writer. The book is interesting and enjoyable, but the reader should understand up-front that it is purely speculative. If jumping to conclusions were an Olympic event, this book would surely take the gold. An enjoyable read, nevertheless."
4,An excellent book,"This book is written in the style of a novel and it works. There is no shortage of specific information about past and present scientific experiments involving zero point energy and 'gravity sheilding'. Many important people and corporations are named and the principals important to understanding this amazing area of energy research are explained clearly and accurately. Occasionally one wishes to 'get to the science' as the book gets started, but it ends up being a terrific read, an invaluable study and a resouce of names, dates, people, places and corporations making waves in this field. Very highly recomended!"
1,Worthless Nonsense,"I am glad that I borrowed this book from the library rather than buying it. This book stinks of pseudo-science, crackpottery, charlatanry, and conspiracy-mongering. Read the review in the online magazine _Salon_. A measure of the Nick Cook's judgement is that he respectfully cites Thomas Bearden of Huntsville, Alabama, from where I am writing, as an authority. However, Cook does not mention that Bearden promotes more forms of wackiness -- Soviet weather control! Perpetual motion! Cattle mutilations as Soviet deep propaganda! -- than you can shake a stick at. Check Tom Bearden out on the Web or in the book _How_to_Build_a_Flying_Saucer_."
3,So What Really Happened?,"This book promises a lot of answers and delivers a lot of disjointed ""facts."" Were Nazi flying saucer experiments responsible for the ""foo-fighters"" reported by Allied planes? Did these become the stuff of which post-Roswell (or is it Rosewell?) sightings were made. Did that Russian and nutty Canadian really defy gravity? After reading this, I still don't know. Still, a diverting read if you are looking for something lightweight."
3,50 years? Why isn't this out yet?,"I haven't read this book, but I have read the interview with Nick Cook at the Atlantic Unbound website, the new story at Jane's about antigravity and Boeing, and the reviews and summaries here at Amazon. This all leads me to one big question- if the Nazis had this technology close to working more than 50 years ago, then why isn't this working yet? You'd think, and I think, that if it was possible to get this technology to work, that in after 60 years and after spending billions they would have done it. This makes me think that either the whole idea of anti-gravity and zero-point energy is completely bogus, or that while the anti-gravity effect is real it isn't practically possible to implement it in a working useful device."
2,Puhhlease,"Mr. Cook feeds our society's insatiable appetite for pseudo-science with a follow-up to his previous book on the same topic. Research on an anti-gravity machine has been going on for far longer than even Mr. Cook demonstrates. Those who are amazed at how seriously this has been taken by nations and corporations should not be. Indeed history is replete with man's attempt to get a free lunch out of the universe - at first with perpetual motion machines and now with anti-gravity ""technology"". ""Zero Point Energy"" is nothing more than the latest technical sounding buzzword for this kind of nonsense. Thank god for Boltzman's Second Law of Thermodynmaics which once and for all put an end to the futile and wasteful quest for a machine one could get more energy out of than was put into. If only we had such a genius to put these modern excuses for scientists out of their jobs we would be most obliged."
1,No Credibility,"For an author with reportedly good credentials, his scientific understanding is low. More than speculation, this book is utter fantasy. Statements that the B-2 bomber has an antigravity device, that a U.S. ship teleported itself in WWII, and that the Germans may have had antigravity flying saucers are for the gullible.Speculation is fine, but THE HUNT FOR ZERO POINT is so far off the reservation that it is silly. Readers interested in historic high-technology efforts in space and aviation may want to check out something like ""Project Orion"" instead."
4,Very interesting read,"All in all I thought this book was very well written and quite entertaining. Unfortunately, like other books dealing with similar subject matter. In the end I was left wanting. The information presented is great but doesn't answer the questions one might buy a book like this to have answered. That being said I would recommend this book, it is well worth the price in entertainment value alone. You may even find some avenues for further independent research. Just be careful ""THEY"" may be watching and listening!"
5,hunt for zero point evaluation,"Easy to read and held my interest; written for everyone, not just the nuclear scientist and intellectual geeks!great photos of the apparatus and interesting stories of the personnel involved.mr cook does an outstanding job in this book. i have bought and read others on the subject that are dull but not this one. the reader will most probably read it in one or two sittings.i have given it to several friends as well.highly recommended reading for those with an inquisitive mind and a bit of scientific interest."
4,A Mystery Yet to Be Solved,"Very interesting information presented in the format of a mystery novel. Excellent historical information on the German secret weapons program of WWII and the U.S. program of the 1950s. Yet there are still many unanswered questions that I had hoped the author would have been able to address more thoroughly. Perhaps the needed information is just not availble. The epilogue refers to a recent revolutionary invention called the Motionless Magnetic Generator which was patented in 2002 that utilizes many cocepts discussed in the book. Perhaps if this product is brought into production, remaining questions will be answered."
2,A journey of sorts,"First off, to be honest, with the mans credentials I expected something more cutting edge and titillating to my curiosity. It took a great deal of effort to keep reading the book hoping it would get on to something that was so far at least hidden from public view. The writing style is good but IMHO there was no real meat to it. I don't mean to dis' the man's journey of discovery, but it's a well known tale about where many have gone before and a story worn thin in the telling."
1,If only I could give it 0 stars...,"This is really, really bad. It pains me to say so, as I'm a big fan of all three of these artists, especially Peter Blegvad. I really wish I could recommend it, as I would almost everything else I've heard from all three, going back to the early Slapp Happy albums and the demo, ""Alcohol"" they made when they first approached Henry Cow to do a collaboration. That union in itself produced one brilliant album (Desperate Straights) and one brilliant cut off an otherwise so-so album (""War"", off of ""In Praise of Learning"") but ended up splintering Slapp Happy until their reunion for ""Ca Va"" (which I like) and this howler. I don't remember hearing anything this bad since I saw the totally forgettable Philip Glass opera (I can't even remember the name!) based on a Grimms' fairy tale, with the immortal line, ""This soup is good!"" Or John Adams' ""Nixon in China"". I guess not everything was meant to be sung."
1,lasted one use,product promptly broke as its not entirely sealed - motor got wet - straight in the bin - here are some extra words for the quota
5,Carole Berry is the best!,"Being an Administrative Assistant I can identify a lot with some of the job situations Bonnie Indermill finds herself in. It's fun to read a book where the main character does the same kind of work you do. Carole Berry's books are the greatest in that they offer humor and a good mystery at the same time. I don't even have to read what the book is about, if it was written by Carole Berry then you know you are in for an enjoyable time. I would highly recommend all of her books."
2,GET CHARGED!,"By the looks of the website, this beverage is endorsed by the likes of Johnny Cage and Raiden.This long lasting energy elixir tastes like someone head-butted my taste buds and put my brain in a half-nelson.I'm going to try and drink an entire case and see if I grow a sweet pony tail and start fighting terrorists on a train.On the negative side, I got so pumped drinking this long lasting energy elixir that I head-butted my computer screen and broke it. Don't know how I'll explain that to the people at work. I'll probably just drink some more and head-butt them in their stupid faces!"
3,an honest review,"i had heards some bad stuff about Steven Seagal's Lightning Drink, but when i saw some at my local 7-11, i decided to try one anyway. Honestly it was not that bad. No, it did not make me want to fight ninjas or give me amazing akido skills when i drank it. It didn't make me want to throw up or anything like that either. It was probably the best tasting Energy drink i've had.Red Bull tastes like Chuck Norris' Urine, Monster tastes like total crap. People tell me i'm a picky person, and if i like it, it must be at the very least, decent."
4,Love and Beverages,Killed a man one time. Energy drink hopped me up so high I thought the checkout clerk was a ninja assassin. Least that's what I told the judge.
3,My order was received damaged,"The energy drinks were purchased as a present, I did not unwrap the box as it was large and awkward, I presented it with a bow and when opened by my son 5 of the cans were smashed and the fluid had evaporated. We were all very disappointed"
5,Ignore the official 'review' - this is a classic VH-1 specia,"Matchbox 20 have proven that they are one of the best bands of modern times with an unbeatable combination of clever lyrics and catchy tunes. Frontman Rob Thomas was the only reason Santana finally received any awards - lets face it, 'Smooth' would have been a Matchbox20 hit if the guitar was performed by the backing band. Their debut album ""Yourself or someone like you"" spawned a number of hit singles plus numerous music videos.Matchbox 20 live are a refreshing change from numerous modern bands who can perform in the studio but not infront of an audience. Both 'Live in Australia' and this new VH-1 edition show a group a the top of their game with the slick teamwork that comes from a group who spend a great deal of time touring."
2,Too much talk talk talk,I would have rather watched a regular concert DVD. All the talk drove me crazy.
3,Fair,"It's a good book; well organized, informative, comprehensive. But it lacks the straight forward sharing of knowledge that a good instructional book needs. It romanticized the topic a bit much and the extensive nature of the book leaves the reader wanting for the tips and tricks we all hope to find as we grow our skill set. It is without a doubt a good addition to a brewing library but, don't rely on this book alone to get you through your cider."
3,hard cider,There is some info on cider sweet a lot more on hard cider.It was informative on how to make a press but they did not give away theircider recipe oh well
3,Too much broad information on growing apples and not enough specifically about cider,"This book seems most appropriate for someone who wants to have their own orchard AND make cider. A lot of the information is all about planting and establishing an orchard leaving little real estate to actually talk about making cider. It was a little disapointing to me because I was expecting it to be the cider equivalent ofHome Cheese Making: Recipes for 75 Delicious CheesesorCharcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking, and Curing, which talk about how to make these products in an artisanal fashion but not about the raising of the animals.The bottom line is this, if you're interested in opening your own orchard and going through the whole process from seed to bottle this could be valuable. However, if you're only interested in cidermaking you will find that a lot of the book is dedicated to growing apple trees and not specifically to making great cider."
1,Cheaply made product...,"After purchasing these chrome handles cover and putting them on my truck they looked very nice. But, they have a tendency to scratch easily, and after having them about 9 months with spring here. I have noticed that the winter was very hard on them, or they're just cheaply made. I say this because they look very bad, pitted, and the chrome looks like crinkled tin foil. I wish I would have never bought them. Now, I am in the process of trying to get them to honor their warranty. Which I feel is going to be a very long process with little results."
3,great,it was great.kinda slow being as we live in the state..but i did appreciate her concern for my item and the emails that let me know the progess on the purchase.. great sealer
5,Don't Leave Home Without It,This book is a must for any boater interested in exploring the West Coast of Vancouver Island. The anchorages identified are wonderful and the warnings should be heeded. This book has been our bible on 5 trips to Barkley Sound and it has never been wrong. We have also used the book to explore remote anchoages further up the coast. The book will not only help you enjoy one of the most beautiful boating destinations on earth but help you navigate these dangerous waters with safety and confidence
5,great workout,I highly recommend this video for the new to experienced exerciser. Linda Shelton is an excellent teacher. This video is safe and effective!
5,This was GREAT!,"Well, When I first picked this book up, I was a little hesatent. But after getting into the entire journey and suspense of it all,I WAS AMAZED! Read this book, it's a MUST!"
1,I think that it was pathetic and uninteresting.,"The book was very slow to start and it didn't get much better later on. It was very hard to undrestand, especially when they used the patwa talk. I think that is what made it uninteresting. Not much immagination has gone into the set-up of the galaxarena and the things on the ""spaceship"". Gillian Rubinstein could have tried to make it more appealing to the young teens age."
4,Good Book For Good Readers,I like Galax-Arena because of how the kids are captured by a man from a planet in a system called Cygni system where Vexak is. I thought that this book was good because it was like me. I love gymnastics. These children meet other kids who are acrobats. Two other kids Liane and Peter know how to perform but Joella doesn't and has a major bad future. The part that I think was bad was the kids killed someone and blood was pouring everywhere.
5,Galax-Arena,"This is a book about Joella, her sister Liaine, and her brother Peter. They are kidnaped from Earth to preform for the alien race, the Vexa. There they find twenty other children who call themselves the ""peb"". They are forced to preform death defying gymnastic stunts for the Vexa who thrive off of their fear and espically their death. But Joella is no Gymnast and is sent to be a pet for one of the Vexa. There she discovers the terrible truth about the Vexa. I liked the way that Ms. Rubinstein explained the emotioans and the thoughts of the characters. The only thing that was a bit hard to follow was the language the Peb spoke. Other than that I thought it was a marvolus book and would recomend it to anyone who likes Si-fi or action."
4,One of the best science-fiction books I have read!,"Gilligan Rubenstein is an amazing writer. It's been quite come time since I've read ""Galax-Arena"", but I can still recall a whole lot of details, just because the writing was so well done. The plot and ending was really great (but I won't reveal it ^_~). I would definitely reccomend this book to other readers!"
1,trojan horse virus l software,"I was extremely disappointed with this WOF software. I purchased it from Amazon, from one of your sellers CDROMUSA. After I received it I tried installing it on my computer. Next I received a message from my security service that a Trojan Horse virus had started installing. Needless to say, I removed the CD from my computer's cd rom drive and I pray that my computer was not compromised. Of course, I immediately got in touch with Amazon and they informed me to get in touch with CDROM USA and explain the problem. The seller apologized and offered to refund my money. I returned the virus laden software and I am now waiting for my refund.I will NOT buy again from AMAZON!!!"
2,bad for window 7,"loaded on my computer - you can play but all options do not work with window 7, cannot exit from program without shutting down computer. i went to the web site for help and what they told me to do did not work either. i have given up on it."
1,Same puzzles over and over,"I don't know if I have played this exact game, but by reading the reviews it appears that I have. The puzzles are all the same: WILL YOU MARRY ME; ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATIONS; BABE RUTH; ETC. Also, as another reviewer remarked, you have to hurry to type in the answer when you're ready to solve - how quickly can you type ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATIONS? I hated this game."
5,Fun Word Game,Wheel of Fortune is an all time favorite. Now I can play it any time of of the day. What a great stress reliever!
2,WHEEL PROBLEMS,After the first wasost in transit. the second was installed with a few issues that were resolved. We had install a flash player program off the internet to get the disc to work
1,Hangs up on XP and Vista,"This game appears to have several bugs that cause it to hang up. I tried installing it on two different PCs; one with XP PRO and another brand new machine with VISTA. In both cases the game would install and play but then you could not exit the game. I've subsequently read about this same problem in other web reviews of the software. You need to terminate the game using the Windows Task Manager. It also does not remember your ""avatar"" when you re-launch the game. I tried to uninstall and re-install several times and got the same problems.As a test I uninstalled this CD version and downloaded the game from the Sony (Wheel of Fortune) game website. The downloaded version behaved the same way.It's too bad because it is a fun game. I am returning this game and would not recommend it."
1,A Waste of Money!,"This is the worst piece of software I have ever seen. What is even more amazing is that there are reviews with a 5 star rating! Where is the difference?? Every time the game starts, you must solve the same puzzles, in the same order, until you finally get to a new puzzle. I have to re-boot the computer to exit the game. Other than those 2 problems, it's fine. Can I give it a 0.01 star rating? Save you money!Amazon should do its customers a favor and remove this version from its shelves."
2,DISAPPOINTED,Wheel Of Fortune DeluxeI am very dissappointed because you have to start over at the very begining each time you play. You already know the answers to each game and it takes too long to get to a new 'board' because of this flaw. Being able to jump to a new board would make the game more fun.
1,Don't Buy This!,"I am so sorry I purchased this game! Although it boasts that is has 2,000 puzzles, it continually starts again at the beginning of the game each time you load it. It starts with *the same* puzzles each time you start the game. In addition, the ""high score"" board doesn't reflect any scores. And to top it all off, the only way I can exit out of the program is to shut down my computer! At first I thought I had a bad copy, but when I went to Encore's ""technical support"" page I was told they are aware of the problem but there is no fix available yet. This was in December 2007, 7 months ago! No fix yet? Nevertheless, they continue to sell this product. I am sooooo incredibly frustrated, and feel like I threw my money away."
1,MAD!!,"I HATE this game, it is no fun at all. I didn't know it was one player until I tried to play it. And yes, it does hang up on XP Pro, found that out too. What a ripoff!"
2,Couldn't get to Work...,"I have Vista and my Mom has Window 7... It didn't work on either PC..It just hung. You can play the game, but you can't get out of it."
5,Great pads,"I installed them on existing old rotors, and the blue abrasive does what it claims to, cleans the surface of the rotors (my rotors were in very good shape and I don't believe they are meant to resurface and clean the rotor) and prepares them for the pads to bite in. Excellent performance. No grabbing, smooth braking, like the originals that came on my Toyota Sequoia 2003."
1,122 Songs from 11 Classic Musicals,Very misleading!! Your info said it was a paperback and it was a CD. I wanted the music book!! False advertising. It was returned and another book ordered.
3,"Pretty good introduction, but needs a second edition","Easy to read, yet covers everything from the simplest electronic concepts and mathematics, up to some useful active filters and digital filters. However, the most useful filters are rushed through in the last 40 or so pages of the book (so some popular filter circuits are skipped, some details to make circuits work well are missing, and there is little explanation of why some circuits aren't as good as others in some situations). Plus, it does contain significant errors (e.g Figure 8.15 is totally wrong and needs Vout, a resistor and a capacitor moved to work as described. There doesn't seem to have been a revision of the book since the original in 1996, and really could do with an update to fix errors and catch up a little with modern developments. It is basically a good book (despite the errors), not too large, not too simple, and deserves another edition."
1,These fences are NOT square!,"BEWARE! Notice that the description of this fence indicates that it is ""L shaped"" and ""straight"". It does NOT state that the two surfaces are square to one another. Do NOT assume they are. The one I received is NOT square, and is therefore useless as a fence."
2,Booty shaking of some unattractive women..,"Definitly not Alabama's finest (believe me).., Most of the dancers could use lotion & Jenny Craig.., Their body parts have more mileage than my 1988 expedition.. The local womens prison ""work release"" program must have in affect during the shooting of this video. And these are my positive comments. After the cover-girl, you'll regurgitate your lunch repeatedly for the rest of the video, Dinner will be out the question.."
3,Give it a rest!,"Restless souls is the story of 'erotic possession'. A young married couple are lured by strange circumstance to an abandoned hotel.The 'virginal' bride, petit as she is, has the most faked boobs - probably a wedding-present from the in-laws. She is seduced by an evil spirt - some kind of throwback from the US Civil War. She vanishes, and her hubby calls in a team of ghostbusters to rescue her... only they all have sex a lot as well.Very little plot, saved only by some nice looking nude women - but not worth the purchase price."
3,"Come on, it's funny!","We all know this movie isn't going to win any awards but come on! Lighten up! We all know why we watch these kinds of movies...and it isn't for special effects. haha. If you like cheesy movies with a good amount of sex in it, you'll like this one. If nothing else, you'll get a good laugh."
2,Pair of Aces,"Western murder mystery is pretty easy to solve but serves as an agreeable vehicle for an amiably cool Dean. And when Mitchum dons clerical black you know there'll be some fun. Otherwise, this is pretty tame fare and the DVD hasn't been restored. (Good luck getting Dean's title song out of your head for days after.)"
5,love this movie!,Dean Marin is a favorite actor and I enjoyed this movie very much! Robert Mitchum iand Doddy McDowell are very believable as the bad guys. gives a glimpse of the old west.
1,It is all wrong,advertised as having an anti-drain check valve....it does NOT! Even on teh Orbit website it doesn't say it has one but the website I ordered it from said it did. As a regular pop-up sprinkler it may be fine but certainly not as a check valve sprinkler
5,Awesome Book,"Bought this book for my mother, her Therapist recommended this book over 20 other books, Highly Recommended, for stretching excercises"
2,gratuite,"After reading the other reviews I was rather disapointed in this book. It sums up a lot of exercises a therapeut might prescribe and one could do with (or without) a swiss ball. Purpose and description of each exercise is very brief, making it easy to follow and easy to use wrong without proper guidance. This book does not advise exercises for any conditions, nor give therapeutic background to the exercises mentioned. So in the end it is only a set of 250 handouts a therapist might give as a reminder to patients."
4,A Very Helpful Strategy Guide,"I bought this Strategy Guide along with the game and it helped me get through the game in a week. It shows the cast of characters, gives general strategies for things like Stealth, Rolling, Gangsters, and Partners in the game. It gives very good Strategy's for all 24 missions which can help because the game itself doesn't help much because it's trying to be real. It also gives a list of all the weapons and how to use them, a list and pictures of all the licensed cars and how to use them, and even a list of where al the secret cars(There's a golf cart hidden in Hyde Park.)There's even a large poster of the cover of the game. So overall, it's a very helpful Strategy Guide worth purchase."
4,Great Documentary on Our Planet,"I knew prior to ordering this set, sight unseen, that it would be very good but it surpassed my expectations. The BBC is probably the foremost producer of outstanding nature documentaries and in this series lies the proof. The BBC Atlas explores how geology, and human history among other factors formed the Continents as we know them today. It covers how humans altered and adapted to life in Africa and Europe with fabulous visuals and amazing photography. Ranging from pre-history right up to the 21st century we see how man and animals have co-existed through the ages and adapted to the environment as it has gone thru various changes. All the various narrators of segments are excellent, especially Sir David Attenborough. I highly recommend both sets."
1,Be Wary of this Book,"Be warned, this book is very dark and disturbing and I'm not sure it would really do anybody any good to read. It does have its interesting points. But it is an independently published book which means sparce editing and radical content. Before you by this or any other idependently published book, you should make sure you know what you're getting into...."
2,"Dont bother, if you like London and the Caribbean","Oh, what a sad and depressing book! And poor Anna was so stupid that it was frustrating to follow her bad choices.The only reason that I was able to finish it, was that it was short, and I wanted to see what it was like for her and the other characters, to see how they ended up.Poor Anna, quite an awful existence, too bad she didn't even try to get home to her island.I am not fond of this kind of writing, but it seemed to fit this book anyway.Im not going to bother to read her other books. I love the Caribbean and love London, and thats enough for me.Though it was educational for me to read, to learn about the dark side of life. Makes you think of what could have been very different for Anna, and sad to see how she spiraled into her abyss."
1,Beware of seller,"They have bad communication and I never received my product. I actually paid extra for it to be shipped quickly. when I emailed them, they said they will refund my money, but they never did,"
3,Well written but uninteresting.,"It could be because I'm male, but I didn't really get into this book. The writing was good but not so incredibly poetic as to interest me on its own. And the characters were uninspiring. I know that it's more realistic to have characters that cannot overcome their problems because most people in real life are like that as well, but I have a hard time dealing with those people so I certainly have little sympathy for a fictional character that is weak and pathetic. I've been told by others that have read this book that I missed the point, and if that's the case I don't mind being educated in my misperceptions but as it stands I can't really recommend this book. However I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either."
2,Not accurate enough to be worthwhile,"I am disappointed with this compass. The directions for calibrating it are ambiguous, and it took me several tries to get it to agree that it was calibrated. That having been done, it seems to display ""distortion"" and incorrect heading information about 20% of the time. Further, even when it thinks it is accurate, it is often at odds with what I know to be the accurate direction -- not totally off, but showing W when we are going almost directly NW, for example. And it has no provision for accuracy beyond the eight directions that it can show with two letters. I will be replacing this with something else."
2,Keep your receipt if you buy this!,"I found this compass fairly easy to calibrate (2 attempts the first time) and it displayed the direction with moderate accuracy for 3 months. Then one day as I pushed a button it sprang out of its windshield mount and landed softly on the carpeted floor of my car. It worked for a short while thereafter, and then just started displaying ""E"", ""N"", or ""NE"" whatever direction I was pointed in - as if only half the sensor circuitry were active.So be warned about spotty quality and/or poor durability of this compass - keep your receipt if you buy it!!!"
1,"Useless, Rubbish, Poor Quality","I was bought this as a present. After spending some time getting it calibrated it worked for about a week, then went off the rails. Now, the odd times when it does actually display something, it doesn't provide any kind of useful information, with the direction displayed being completely inaccurate. DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,Best Auto Compass I Have Found,"The V100 is a great buy. It was easy to set up and calibrate, and gives consistently accurate readings. It stays securely attached to my windshield. The overall design is well thought out.I have tried many conventional compasses for my car, and they have never seem to work right. This one fills my needs, and at a very reasonable price."
2,PNI V100 Digital Vehicle Compass,"Nice idea and this is a good looking unit, and not terribly bad for the money, but its ability to maintain directional accuracy is of questionable quality. Compass seems to drift regardless of where mounted and requires recalibration quite often. I suspect compass has the same degree of accuracy as does the digital clock that loses 30 seconds per day. Electronics today should be more dependable than this unit."
1,Don't Risk It...,"This product never worked -- buttons were defective, it wouldn't stay on, it wouldn't calibrate. The seller - Sky Box USA - wouldn't exchange or refund because I was outside of the ""30 day window"" (this was a Christmas present, and a very disappointing one at that). You'll want to look elsewhere for technology that should be as reliable as a Casio watch."
1,PNI V100,"This was the first of three different PNI compass models I have bought through Amazon, and I would not recommend any of them. If they worked right, I would love them. But all three of them will not stay on. It says they will stay on unless no change in the magnetic direction is for ten minutes. This simply is not true as all three of mine that I have bought shut off all the time, even if I just drive around the block all day."
1,Useless,The motion sensor wouldn't turn it on. It does not maintain calibration. Cold weather numbs it. I'm tossing it out.
3,PNI V100 Digital Vehicle Compass,"Product looks like it would function well, mounts well, easy to read, easy to calibrate. However, there is too much interference so we always get an interference message. Each time we calibrate the compass it works for a minute then the compass readings are all wrong. Not good for our SUV."
1,Can it actually be useful?,The steel in the vehicle is gonna throw this thing off six ways to Sunday. It's too cheap to have compensation built in. Not to mention magnetic declination.<C>heap <U>seless <G>arbage.
1,"Doesn't stick, not accurate, don't buy it!","Minor changes in the temparature of your windshield are enough to send the compass flying off, usually while driving. Additionally, it needs to be mounted at least 5 inches from a speaker or it wont work, which in my vehicle is nearly impossible. Nice idea but not worth the effort..."
4,"Digital Compass-Passes, but not without sticking issues","This little wonder does exactly what it's supposed to do. It tells you in what direction you're driving. That's what it does well. What it doesn't do as well is stick to your windshield. Even though it has three suction cups, it still has trouble staying where you put it.But, aside from that issue, it works as advertised."
1,never received it,I have never received this item...and I can't find anyone to speak to at amazon about it.PLEASE CONTACT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,love my knives!,"I am so pleased with the 5"" and 7"" Cuisinarat knives. They are excellent quality and very sharp. easy to hold and handle. I must admit I was surprised because of the low cost. They are wonderful."
2,Found it to be lacking...,"Bought this because it was cheap and I didn't have a knife specifically for chopping and cutting veggies. I don't find that this knife does any better than the random knife I would pull out of our knife block.Admittedly, I'm an amateur in the kitchen, but have spent a lot of time learning and experimenting recently and I just was not that impressed. The two major issues I have with this are:1. Weight - This is a very light knife. I expected it to be a tad heavier for chopping duty but it is paper light.2. Food Sticking - I had been under the impression that with a Santoku knife that food was less likely to stick to the blade while cutting. This is not the case, at least with the zucchini I had prepared recently with this.Its a cheap knife so I don't regret the purchase, I would just definitely have spent a bit more on a better knife had I known."
3,Heirlooms in Needlepoint,"This was quite a surprise for the price. I am quite picky with my needlepoint books and what I bother to purchase. This was done differently than any other of them I own. Usually there is discussion for inspiration and the chart. The entire book may have the similar theme, page after page. This book by Sue Hawkins is really interesting in that it covers various themes- Tudor, Tunisian, Victorian, Shakespearian, Orient, 16th century, patchwork, and even a bargello. There are photographs of the items as usual, but often instead of only charting the needlepoint, there are actual full sized drawings to transfer to canvas easily so that is very neat I think! I bought this sight unseen- a dangerous practice indeed- but am very happy to own it."
5,JIMMY AT HIS BEST - Vol. 2,"Jimmy Durante had a long, unblemished career in show busines. (Just TRY to find negative articles about this sweet man.) Much of his musical and movie output was loud, raucus comedy. Late in his career, he put out three albums of standards backed by big band arrangements and full chorus. The 1964 collection ""Hello Young Lovers"" (The first 10 songs on this double album CD) was the second of the three albums. The other two were 1962's ""September Song"" and 1965's ""Jimy Durante's Way of Life"". You will find on these albums some of the same songs used so effectively in movies such as ""It Could Happen To You"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"". Sentimental, a little sappy, but so beautiful. Jimmy Durante's musical maturity shines in these recordings. GET ALL THREE."
3,Great idea but,"This product is very useful but unfortunately they are using cast metal with the grabber and it easily deforms and after a little time it bends out of shape and is less useful opening doors, though still great turning on or off a faucet. For the germaphobe it is a great idea, but the product is not very durable."
3,Wonderful - but flawed,"In one respect this is a wonderful collection of the Jacksons' pre-Motown work. The studio recorded material - basically the first half of the disc - is presented in the best quality possible, and thankfully NOT overdubbed with new instrumentation as has happened on a number of other discs where this material has been collected. Sadly though the disc is flawed, as the rehearsal taped material on the second half of it DOES suffer from the overdubbing problem. It is actually quite hard to find this material in its original, pristine state - I have come across it on only two or three occasions on budget European releases - and it is sad that this collection falls down here, despite the contrary claim on the rather misleading sleeve note!"
1,Never recibe,"Hello. I bought some time ago the cd and i never recibe the item, now i am waiting yet recibe the cd. I hope recibe quickly."
3,Dragons of Chaos is just like the other anthologies.,"Dragons of Chaos is the same as the other anthologies in the fact that some stories are great and others are truly terrible. This collection of short stories by various authors of the Dragonlance saga has some very good stories. Knaak's Son of Huma is great and so is the Dragon's Eye. But there are others that are simply boring and make you say ""I wish I skipped that one."" And most of the stories take place either after or before the Chaos war, not during it. But I have to say that Roger Moore's ""There is Another Shore..."" is probably the best story. It tells of two men who are whisked into a parallel dimension where the Cataclysm never happened! This was an awesome story and should have been a book. It deserves 5 stars itself. So pick up this anthology if just to read Moore's great short story."
5,The ongoing battle continues...,"I really like the way this series is going, and The Dragons of Chaos is no exception. There is lots of action, character development, twists in the plot, and finishing the book makes you anxiously wanting the next book of the series to come out.Weis and Hickman give us just enough information on certain characters and events to get your mind thinking on what could happen - and then when it finally happens, it's very different than what you expected.I have found Weis and Hickman to be consistently excellent writers, and I've read most of their other books. I felt it would be hard to come close to the success of their first Dragons series, but with such an excellent storyline, it will be close.I definately suggest reading this anthology. What are you waiting for? Get it!"
4,It was exciting to find out some of the Dragonlace History.,The short stories in this book were very entertaining. They showed some of the things that I wanted to know after reading the chronicles and the legends. If anyone reads Dragonlance that wants to E-mail me go for it!!
3,Looks chic and Good value for money,the leather strap is better than metallic; this at least will not leave black traces on your wrist.
5,Fossil Watch,Beatiful watch. It's worth the price and then some. You can wear it with White or Yellow gold. It's great for Dress-up or casual. Great price.
3,Chain Maille review,"This book is strictly for the person wishing to make chain maille garments. I had hoped to find some jewelry instructions - not so. Oh, well - not all books suit one's purpose."
4,"Four first are good, can't wait for the others...","I was hugely disappointed when Fox decided to replace The Ripping Friends with more Pokemon-esque cartoons. I'm relieved though, that they at least released these episodes on video/dvd. Unfortunately, this collection only has the first four episodes out of thirteen or so (The Ripping Friends were aired for only one season).Extras on the DVD include a preview and some storyboards with the animation sequence they illustrated. I wish they had an interview with the genius behind the madness, John K., who is also the creator of Ren and Stimpy.I think kids won't find the show as entertaining as kitsch/nostalga loving teens and adults. Some of the jokes are actually pretty ""mature"" ... .Wish I could give the collection 5 stars, but the lack of special features and being only 4 episodes (total of 80 minutes) is a definite minus."
5,A GREAT PLACE TO START LISTENING TO CHICAGO BLUES,"The track listing wont tell you, but this isnt just Little Walter on his own. The first eleven tracks are by him and are all VERY strong early sides including the fabulous ""Too Late"" and ""Juke"", his big hit. But you also get to hear him backing up Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, John Brim, Floyd Jones, Memphis Minnie and Johnny Shines. ALL this stuff is classic 1950's, ALL of it is straight out of the great Chess studios and it ALL rocks! - add to that great sound and beautiful packaging, and you've got a winner. New to vintage Chicago Blues? start here!"
5,Finally the DVD and the Concert Version!,"I have been blessed with being in the right place and time to be able to partake or 2 versions this week. As a writer for the [...] Arts section I was able to scoop 'em all and get my double review in, which I hope you all read and put me in my place in the comment section:))The piece - Sondhiem Times 2 - Evening Primrose In Concert and on DVD:) by Melody Breyer-GrellWell no that I plugged it to no end, I do think it was a reason it was made for a screen special and although I was overjoyed to see it live -- the DVD it the thing:)Looking forward to all your opinions on the peice.MBG"
2,Where are the bonus features?,I enjoyed the video and was looking forward to the extra bonus features but my husband and I tried every way possible to find them on the disc but could not find them. Can anyone help me find the bonus features? I would appreciate any help!!1
4,Charming!,"I just got my copy and, as soon as the kids were in bed, I watched it. It was CHARMING! I've long wanted to see this program and I'm so thrilled that this has been released. The story is great and the songs are among Sondheim's best. I love the longing of ""When"" and ""Take me to the World"". The picture quality could be better...that's the only reason that I docked it a star...but the work itself deserves the highest accolades!"
2,Extremely poor picture quality,"Extremely poor picture quality, just about impossible to adjust the color quality on this tv. Totally disappointed with my purchase of this TV."
5,Missing sister,What a well written story. My heart goes out to the family of Fran and Janice. It's sad that in today's society that there is still such an injustice. People can be so cruel. I applaud all the hard work put in to writing this story.
1,Disappointing,"I like 90% of LTJ Bukem's music and compilations, but was very disappointed with Studio X."
3,Gotta love babes behind bars.,"I confess, I am a huge fan of WIP (Women in Prison) movies. Is it the sweaty stains that reveal pert nipples on their jailhouse duds? The fact that no matter how degraded or disgusting their surroundings, these gals still wear make up fit for a Cosmo shoot? Is it the repressed lesbian lusts of the guards and the warden? Or is it all these things, stirred to boil, and strained to make a fine tea of sex and violence (and naked showering)? This film does the genre proud, replete with lesbo warden, lesbo bitch rapist, running around the jungle bare foot, and sleazy straight sex. I mean, whaddya expecting here, War and Peace?"
4,"wow, the scene with the head matron was pretty hot","OK, maybe I liked the film because I didn't expect much but it was actually very intertaining to watch. And as the title for my review says,..the scene with the head matron was actually very hot which I didn't expect. If you can buy the movie for under $10 it is worth it."
3,Not really that good!,Ok there are a couple of good scenes here but not worth buying - trust me I did and I regret it!The towel scene is very good and so is the lesbo scene with the warden but way to much story line!
2,"Stick with the Shore, Sitch","I hope you like hearing the word ""situation"" about 75 million times, b/c you will when you buy this DVD. I'm embarrassed for Mike Sorrentino.....ugh, enough already.Most of the workout is Beginner friendly. What I love (big surprise here...) are the ab segments. Good stuff there! I do them together, and I work up a bit of a sweat. They are the only reason I haven't chucked the DVD (I'm not new to weight training, and the other segments are too short and too easy.)I just play my own music to drown out Mike.Love Jersey shore though..."
1,Not A Good Situation,"Is this a joke? Seriously this needs to be in the trash. The moves were easy enough for aa toddler to do. I get more of a workout going up and down my stairs, one of them was less than 10 minutes and the other was about 14. The main dialogue in the DVD is him bragging about himself and how to get ""the situation"". If you want a 30 something year old guy who makes money off of being drunk and being on a show with no moral and very little value to tell you how to get the ""situation"" abs and talk about himself the majority of the time then this dvd is perfect for you! But if you actually want to get abs and look good then save your money."
1,Best Drinking Game Ever!!!!,"This is by far the best drinking game of all time. All you have to do is take a drink everytime this toolbox says the word ""situation."" For more expirienced drinkers take a drink everytime he says the word ""okay"" By the end of the workout you will be drunk.This dumbass had me in tears because I was laughing so hard at his dialogue and his workout that is in his opinion ""No Joke"". Trust me this is very entertaining and will get you feeling drunk faster than a power hour.As for this being a good work out? Your better off watching Helen Keller read a Stucko wall."
3,The stupid workout,I can't handle Mikes personality. He is very annoying. I think if you follow it i believe you'll see results. Its not a fast pass overwhelming workout but a good one. I recommend watching it with the volume all the way down.
2,Weak,"The workout is not what I thought it would be. His workout video is not very professional, I get the vibe this guy got all his friends together and just put something together. Nice try but would only reccomend for serious people who workout."
1,Not real exercise instruction - for entertainment purposes only (comedy),"This is utterly stupid. While these types of workouts would no doubt produce some degree of results if done consistently, the few exercises shown in the video preview are both poor choices and demonstrate very poor form. This guy is a celebrity, not a fitness expert, and this video should be considered for entertainment purposes only (comedy, specifically).If someone is interested in developing their best possible physique there are hundreds of books and videos vastly superior to this."
2,This is definely just for entertainment.,"I've never watched JS. From what I do know about that show is from clips from other shows and SNL skits. Anyway, I bought this DVD since Sitch does have a great body and I was looking for a new workout DVD.He can't even count (""we have 10 or 15 seconds left"") and admits he's not a fitness expert. He doesn't have proper form most of the time and his other 2 helpers had different form than he had in some of the segments.The ab exercises, some I'd never heard of before & that was a good thing."
5,Great for White Elephant Exchange,"I purchased this DVD for a White Elephant exchange and it was a hit! We later popped it in and laughed until we cried. As far as a true workout video, I don't think I could take this guy seriously. But it was worth the money just for the laughs."
5,Much more challenging than I thought.,"Yes, just turn down the localized Jersey rhetoric and after that the user has five workouts that have a varying degree of difficulty depending upon the age and the condition of the participant.I work out every day, but I must state that the legs and abs 15 minute segments were very challenging to me.Overall, I like the option of doing one 15 minute segment in the morning before work and one 15 minute segment in the evening after work.Naturally, the intensity of this workout will vary as well depending upon what weight of dumbbell is being used. I use the 15 # dumbbells and hope to start using 20# bells next.I can tell that I am getting stronger by using this DVD."
4,Chicken Fried Fun!,"If you are looking for a collection of silly, country novelty songs - this one's for you! Truly the silliest of the silly, this really is great for a few laughs."
5,Wonderful,My grandaughter really loves this book. The story is great. This is her favorite so far of the step into reading books.
3,Expected More,"When Music was released last September I rushed out, and I bought the original version and this limited edition. There is not much difference: same amount of tracks as original version, a few more pages in the booklet, a book type case and a metal belt buckle with MUSIC embedded into it, which is embedded into the cover. After a wonderful limited edition version of Ray Of Light, which was spectacular, one would expect more when spending this much on a Limited Edition version of an album."
3,Hmmm?,"It seems the book was written in haste?. Two instances of this that easily come to mind are these: On the back flap (as well as in the editorial reviews here) it states that the author spent three years as an FO in Vietnam. According to the author (in the book)he spent three years in the Army and 11 months as an FO in Vietnam.Secondly, In the last story he talks about his friend that was killed in 1969 and reflecting on their youth at the funeral that they were both only 19. But in the beginning of the book he says he joined the service one year out of high school in 1966 and did three years. The numbers don't match.Things like this along with every poular cliche associated with the Vietnam experience being included in the book lead me to believe that this book is perhaps a non-fiction intertwined with a creatively abstract writers flare.It leaves you quite unable to take it to heart."
4,Illuminating!,"I never thought that I would read a military book, but on the suggestion of my fathr I picked up a copy of INTO THE GREEN and was blown away! The honest details about Cherokee McDonald's experience in Vietnam, while gory, helped me understand what a generation of men dealt with and what I will clearly never fully understand. Short and concise, this book is a must read for all young Americans who want to really know what fighting a war is all about."
1,twice is enuff,"have had two toshiba 27"" tv's in last 2 years-took the first one back because of wavering/swaying picture quality on several stations, returned second for same problem but on only one station-it happened to be our super bowl station! bought them because of outstanding consumer report reviews-sorry but i will never buy one again, just another reminder that these reports are no bible."
5,Great Gift,I cannot recommend these Schott's books enough. They are fabulous gifts because they're just so entertaining.
3,At least it works,I would be hesitant to purchase again from this retailer. The gun is VERY worn and the photo mis represented the product I recieved. I know the product was used but it was very rusty and in rough shape. I cleaned it up and at least it works for the flooring project I had too do.
3,Emerald Walnuts Subscription,"I originally signed up for double shipment every month of Emerald's Glazed walnuts and was very happy. Then, they cancelled me for no reason. Said they couldn't get the product. Only, then I saw it back on Amazon but at a higher price. Again, I signed up only now they KEEP raising the prices almost every shipment is higher and higher. Pretty soon, it's going to be higher than the grocery stores and I won't need Amazon anymore. What's the purpose of signing up for the subscriptions again? Thought it was to have a price advantage."
5,Delicious walnuts,These glazed walnuts are really tasty. I mix them with regular un-glazed walnuts to cut the sweetness factor a bit. Walnuts are so good for your health but I had trouble enjoying them plain. This helps me get my nutrition and satisfies as a sweet treat.
1,Very disappointed,I purchased these for Xmas gifts for my bowling team and I was lvery disappointed in the craftmanship of this product. I had to make several repairs to them so that I could still give them as gifts. The string that the fake lights were on was broken so I had to remove them. I also had to reglue the Santa in several places.
2,Not very accurate,"I had difficulty calibrating this in my car: it took three tries (i.e., six circles of a parking lot). It is mounted slightly above the dashboard in the center of the window. I have compared its reading with a GPS receiver in the car. Sometimes it is pretty accurate, but other times it shows ""distortion"" warning when remote from any possible sources of interference. Sometimes, but not always, driving down a perfectly straight road the compass heading will vary as much as 60 degrees, then jump back to the correct course. Other times it will be consistently 15 to 30 degrees either left or right of the true course. Maybe it is problem with my car, but if so, then this device is not really suitable for cars."
1,Junk,"To be honest, based on my experience, I wouldn't waste your money. I have never got the unit to work properly. On top of which, it was very difficult to even get the unit open to install the batteries. Look elsewhere."
1,Hard to Calibrate and died...,"I agree that its tough to calibrate... Took me about a month to get it right... when it worked it worked fine. then after 2 months, it just went blank... nada... nothing on the screen."
2,Works only for a short time,"I had this unit for three months before it stopped working. It worked well until then, now it just gives out incorrect readings and sometimes error messages.I liked using it, otherwise. Having a vehicle compass is really nice in a car; it helps out a lot in a new area just to get oriented."
1,calibration?,"I tried to calibrate it several times, but it never did have a north on it. Not sure if I was doing it wrong, or product was defective. Mounts easily to glass only, and seemed to hold pretty well with the suction cups."
2,When it works,"I've tried a number of automobile compasses but they invariably were affected by my vehicle's and environmental factors. Then I purchased the PNI V600 and was in Columbus heaven. Both the car and hand-held appeared to function within a very reasonable level of accuracy. I mounted it a little below my driving line-of-sight which was great.Then after about 6 months, the suction cups gave out at inconsistent intervals. So after each mishap, I'd do my circles,set the buttons and explain to our local law enformance why I was driving in circles. The recalibration usually worked on the first merry-go-round about 4 of 5 times. My most recent attempts were unsuccessful so I'm trying to schedule a fourth try.Nice tool but I feel like a fool-ish gadget lover always headed in the wrong direction."
1,These Suck,These compasses are not even worth using...You might just as well navigate using the sun and the stars.
3,Nice compass,"I've been using this compass for a few months now. It wasn't easy setting it up since you have to drive in circles really slowly to get it calibrated. Once it is on, however, it does its job well."
3,"Relatively consistent, but never the right direction","The mounting instructions for the compass require that you line it up in exactly the right direction relative to your car. If I put the compass in the one spot on my car that would allow that, it would impair the visibility through the windshield. As it is, the location it should be placed in the car causes the compass to be consistenly 15 degrees off because the windshield isn't flat."
1,Will Not Mount To Car,"Calibrating the compass had to be done several times, and even then it would not show a correct reading. Even after calibration, distortion would appear on the screen often. Then, on top of all of that, it would not even mount to ANY part of my car. The windshield, dashboard, or the area next to the control panel. Granted, it was cold outside, but we get cold weather a lot in New York, and once the weather turned for the worst, it would probably fall off the windshield anyway. I would not recommend this to anybody looking for a compass for their car."
5,This vid rocks,"If u love the black album then u will love this. It covers the bands tour of the black album plus sad + roam videos. Also live performances of for whom the bell tolls and harvester of sorrow,sad, sandman (twice !), and nothing else matters. Also backstage at the grammys.i got it 3 months ago and have wathched it 20 times since."
3,Mostly OK but...,I would have enjoyed this DVD more if there were more concert footage. The behind-the-scenes coverage just makes Lars look like a mentally deficient jerk who didn't get his ass beat enough as a kid. The Sandman and Unforgiven video clips and sound are very good.
4,Year and A Half is pretty good,"The great part about this DVD is that it really gets across the genuine nature of Metallica as a band. They work very hard, and are dedicated to their music. If it isn't apparent in any of their albums or concerts, it is in this DVD. It was extremely interesting seeing the details of one of the longest metal tours ever, and watching the recording was fun and interesting. Some drawbacks include: lack of special features (not-a-one!), copious amounts of horse-play by the band and every other loser that knows their on camera, and Lars Ulrich. Another thing that was dissapointing was the concerts, which I felt were a little boring."
3,self-serving doctors write book,Why their way is the best way. I suggest you read What your doctor Won't Tell You. This is a gutsy non self-serving and tell all book that will help you get through our terrible health system
2,hospitalists are horrible for your care,obviously these two work for a large hospital; one that believes it is better for their doctors to stay at the clinic rather than see their patients at the hospital-if they are admitted. The idea that these two tell us that hospitalists are better for us than our own doctor tells me they have their own agenda. Be careful of what you read.
1,50% Chance of product working,I purchased two (2) of these switches. Installed the first one and the toggle glowed but did not turn the lights on or off let alone function as a dimmer. The second switch works fine. The dang shipping cost is not worth returning the first switch. Word to the wise... DONT BUY THEM...but if you must get two and you'll have a 50% chance like myself.
5,A very good television documentary.,"If you want to know how Mick Jagger works when he's surrounded by great artists, then this is the best documentary."
5,Being Mick-something I always wanted to see!,"For any Rolling Stones or Mick Jagger fan, this is a must! It is always enjoyable to see how the ""other half"" lives including Rock Royalty such a Sir Mick. He is a musical genius and the glimpse into his life is quite interesting as we see Mick as the family man and the musician. Being from Florida, I especially enjoyed the scene from Miami where Mick goes on an airboat looking for gators, I assume in his offtime from working with Lenny Kravitz. Overall very interesting and something I thought I would never get to see....a candid glimpse of a musical icon! I've watched it so many times and it is a necessary collector's item for the Stones fan!"
5,The book to own for anyone interested in Limoges porcelain!,"This is the perfect book for the person wanting to know about Limoges porcelain. From Limoges Boxes to specific manufactures of all different types of pieces, it's all in here! The pictures are beautiful! The backmarks and values make it a great tool for anyone wanting to collect Limoges."
3,Too much NEW Limoges,I purchased this book based on these reviews and I was disappointed. I am interested in ANTIQUE Limoges vs newer pieces of Limoges and new boxes from retail shops. Love Schiffer books and I highly recommend Antique Limoges at Home.
4,Almost as good as Finnish ones,"I am really pleased with these, although my comparison is to the non-retractable Finnish Exels that I normally use and that is why I give a 4. The rubber shock absorbers have taken well to the concrete pathways I frequent and I'm happy to see that after several hours use they don't yet show much sign of wear and tear. I have yet to try them on a tarmac surface and see if they do as well. The only drawback on this model has been the lack of hold on wet concrete and the need to make sure the poles are screwed tightly to the desired length and don't suddenly retract. Otherwise the fact that they are retractable makes them easy to travel with. They were however too long to fit into my suitcase, so don't count of stowing them in there when travelling by air. A good buy, but much pricier than in Finland."
4,Awesome Customer Service,"I love the dress. It is perfect for a casual beach wedding. Elegant yet practical. The neck line in the back is closed, which is what I wanted so that I could wear a bra. The online sizing chart is spot on. Mine fits like it was custom tailored for me. Most of all, I was very happy with the service. After I placed the order on Amazon, I called the company direct to confirm. I was in need of the dress asap. I recieved it in two days (I did pay for express shipping). Awesome, considering the company is in Hawaii and I am in Michigan. Thank you Maui Shirts!"
1,"a boring movie ,trying to be sophisticated and falling short","i so wanted this to be one of the really interesting, but it did not even come close. boring, boring, boring. absolutely, nothing interesting. i thought that it would be alot more sophisticated due to it's subject matter and actors. sad but true."
1,RIP OFF,"WOW.. this is such a rip off. Who put this out , why? This is not even a Game album. I dont usualy throw a CD out of car window. WOW what a rip off"
4,ignore everyone below me,"I just bought this cd, and it's definately worth the money. Who cares that JT is in most of some of the tracks he's in? that was the case with 50 in Documentary. The fact is this cd is bangin, an I'm glad I bought it.I'd say rather than hating it for featuring JT, y'all should listen to him, cuz this guy is talented."
1,word to my bloods,The game copies peoples work I have been writing lyrics for him for years now none of this is original if you want an album try lil weezy he's on top of the game in a couple of his songs peace homies
3,not a bad effort,"this cd is not a bad effort,but i dont really dig jt the bigga figga or his taste in beats,so this does have a bearing on a album bank rolled by jt,sometimes game gets to break loss but jt keeps turning the spotlight back onto himself,but you do get a cool poster with the cd too"
5,Great,Received as advertised in perfect unopened condition. Easy to install with really great graphics. A great gift for the gamers out there.
2,Many problems with the locking mechanism,I have been Nordic walking (really hiking up and down mountains) for nearly 4 years.I used to love these poles. They are carbon and don't vibrate like aluminum poles. And they are light.However I continually have issues with the locking mechanism not locking. I have sent the poles back once. Leki has a lifetime guarantee. They sent out repaired poles. But I have failures again.However... having the locking mechanism fail (will not lock at all) is terrible. Once I had to use the poles at their shortest size since I couldn't lock them. Another time I had to abandon the trip.I have Leki traveler poles I use when traveling by air and have had no problems with them.I have given up on these an have just ordered some SWIX fixed length carbon poles.
5,Found it by happenstance online.....,"I'm a big fan of foreign music, stuff that's not available in the USA. I was perusing another website to expand my library and stumbled upon Maia. This girl's Swedish (and half-Japanese), and has a GREAT sound! Her style (and singing) is very reminiscent of Regina Spektor (if you don't know who she is, check her out, too). Breathy voice, primarily piano, interesting uses of harmony, some backup singers/choirs, very unique and unpredictable. Certainly not ""pop"" music in the American sense, and highly recommended."
1,Overpriced!,"Target and ToysRUs sell these sets for more than 1/3 of this price and it's barely worth that. The dresses are very hard for little hands to put on the little dolls, nevermind the miniature shoes (at least until they get lost.) I can tell the dresses won't last long, since they are rubber and will probably rip soon. My daughter is 3 and gave up playing with this quickly. We'll be looking for something larger and easier for her to dress until she's older. But I won't be buying it from this overpriced retailer, that's for sure. I shop Amazon all the time, but I am weary of their partner retailers..."
1,Great product -- until it dies.,"I've owned this machine for less than six months, and it's gone through TWO laser pickups. With only a skimpy 90-day warranty on laber, this DVD player has so far cost me! There's either a terrible design flaw, or I've been unlucky enough to receive two bad laser assemblies. Personally, I think there's a design or manufacturing flaw involved. There's no reason why I went through two lasers in screening somewhere between 30 and 40 movies, between March 13 and July 25, 2001. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MODEL!!"
2,"Good machine, horrible warranty","I bought this machine when it was a little more expensive and I am generally happy with the features and capabilities. This is also the second Toshiba DVD player that I have owned. The only thing that is a drawback (and it's a big one)is the warranty service. The machine' remote suffered a melt-down after being used for two months. After conferring with Toshiba's customer service about warranty support for the remote I brought it to their designated service center in my area. -Remotes are not serviced, they are just replaced.- After replacing the remote (under warranty) Toshiba changed the text of their warranty and decided that they weren't going to honor their previous warranty and had the service center bill me (...) Beware the service and get their promises of support in writing. If you never use the equipment, it will never need service."
1,Died after three movies,It worked fine for the three DVD's I was able to watch before it died. Approxiamately two weeks after the warranty expired. The authorized repair people said the repair would be about $230. Just what I paid for it! This may be the exception but I thought that I should warn others of my experience. Good luck!
1,Broken in 2 years,Worked great until it decided to no longer play anything. 2 years old. $400 at the time of purchase. Great.
5,Easy to use,"I bought this last weekend, and I'm very happy with the picture quality, the ease of use, and the feel of the remote control. A couple notes of caution. First, if you're planning on using this with a TV with S video input, beware that the S video cable is not included.Secondly, I am not using this machine to play audio CDs, so I cannot comment on the ease of playing audio CDs or CDRWs."
5,The Shroud of Turin,"It's called hoax bcs the Italian scientists took the samples from its edges as it's the only site tht allowed by the Vatican. Hwvr, accorind to other docs, around 1400 AD, the shroud was always displayed in public. People were allowed to touch it and mostly they touched the edges. Hwvr, I watched from other DVD: ""THE REAL FACE OF JESUS"" about some computer imaging scientis tried to get more details about the image from the shroud using latest computer technologies. Also how tht man left a mystery tht made them headache. Finally they found it ! One of them almost cried to be realised & how ths man suffered from Roman's tortured."
5,Generalize vector calculus for general relativity,"This book covers the basic math behind the ""geometric approach"" to tensor calculus. The math required is not heavy, but it requires some considerable mathematical maturity. If talk of ""the boundary of a boundary is zero"" or ""exterior derivative"" confuses you, this is a good book. An intuitive approach, not a sea of indices. If you want really heavy stuff then Bishop & Goldberg is good.Most Dover math books are first rate. This one is."
5,Perfect Match,"My late mother always has the silverwares in 12's so I got the 20 piece one to complete my dozen. This set has a solid feel and a very unique pattern. Bamboo design is a little easy to match withCorelle Bamboo Leaf Square Round 16-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 4. The bonus serving set is a real treat too. The end set-up just looks classy. I'm enjoying it a lot but I guess it's because i'm older now."
1,Caught fire,DO NOT BUY THIS TV. I bought a Vizio 26inch and it caught fire. Thankfully I was standing right there when it erupted into flames and was able to put it out.
1,Vizio crashes and burns-out,"I seem to be a LUCKY one, owning this tv for 1.75 years. In that time, it served me as a TV. It costs on the low end for this type of TV, but the price is competitive, and you don't get the same value. I have worked as a Sony Rep in the past, and I will never pay for Vizio again EVER. I WILL PAY MORE NEXT TIME so I can have a TV that will last for at least a few years rather this notorious failure of a VIZIO excuse for an LCD TV."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I bought this TV in March of last year for my bedroom. I wound up using it very little. In October I couldn't get it to turn on anymore. So it went on the blink with minimal use. My husband said the problem seemed to be in the power supply. I looked online about customer service and found lots of bad reviews which said good luck with getting these things fixed. I decided not to fool with getting a repair because of those reviews, and returned it to the store for a full refund. Don't waste your money on this cheap brand, it's not worth the hassle."
4,very nice for the money,This TV has a very nice picture for standard analog channels and a stunning HD picture. DVD's are very crisp as well. I have no complaints...I called customer service a few times with some questions..they were helpful.
2,Video broke within a year,"For a fairly expensive item, I would have expected the VCR portion to work longer than it did. We only used this TV for long car rides, so it was used maybe 10 times before it broke. With only a 90 day warranty, we got very little use out of it and are out of luck. Would not recommend buying this product."
3,"Liaisons Dangeureuses, Korean style","Personnally, I didn't care bout the mandarin or cantonese languages... I always prefer to watch actors speaking in their mother tongue anyway.Although I don't understand Korean, I enjoyed watching the movie very much (not to mention the hottest erotic scenes between the lovers!!)""Menage a trois"" or adultery is not a very original subject in the industry. As a result, it makes the attempt of any director to make it captivating and intriguing very difficult.The success of this movie lays more in the way it is beautifully and romantically filmed, and the way it is spontaneoulsy and well acted, rather than in the story itself. The spectator will like each caracter, because one can easily relate to each of them. They are just ""every day"", working, middle-class people, otherwise very sensible and likeable, who are caught in a dangerous path which they didn't choose. None wants to act soon enough and escape from this path, until it is too late."
4,"video quality 3 stars, audio 2 star, the story not bad","this is a korean movie and it is somewhat mysterious why its audio track is in cantonese and mandarin dubbing only... the dubbing usually need to match with the lip movement and therefore it is hard to match the original script. that said, the mandarin dubbing is not bad. if it can have the original korean audio track, would be one more option for the viewer.for the video, it kind of feels like a VHS to DVD-R transfer work.this movie has quite a bit of suspense and the details are quite nicely filmed... a bit grotesque kind of movie but if you like story with original plot and don't mind grotesque movies then you may like it."
2,A simple story of deceit and murder.,"The movie picks some momentum during the first half, but runs out of puff during the second and culminates with a fairly dull end. It is essentially a 'a day in the life of' kind of a movie. Lots of movie time has been spent shwoing people chopping vegetables, working in office, driving to work and watching TV instead developing the characters and making the simple story a wee bit interesting.The DVD quality and the dubbing is poor."
3,Tivoli's stained image?,"Love the Audio quality...Tivoli has this down. Nice lows. Now externally, the Cherry finish on my ""Model 3"" speaker just doesn't match in the least my Tivoli Model 3 Clock radio. When there are side x side, which unfortuantly they are, it looks as if I'm the one aesthetically challanged. I have to say to myself ""well at least it sounds good"" Tivoli, oh Tivoli..."
5,Great knife for delicate foods,Great for cutting tomatoes and other delicate fruits and vegetables. Also great for cutting the skin off delicate veggies like tomatoes.
5,The reviews were right,I researched this class of speakers for quite a while before finally making a decision. The reviews rated these speakers as excellent and indeed they turned out to be.
3,Okay for a small room,"These were my first polk speakers. I use them as sides along with a csi3 center, fxi3 backs, and a velodyne sub. They're okay, but in a medium-sized room, they definitely need the help of a sub (and I'm not the type who needs wall-shaking sound). Otherwise, they don't produce much bass and the sound is kind of hollow. These aren't bad, but maybe my expectations were too high."
4,Only In Your Arms,"Definitely a great book. It kept my interest from page one. I have to rank it in her top four best novels she wrote, which is high praise since she's one of the best authors I have read so far (and I have read ALOT of books)."
2,Disappointing for a Lisa Kleypas book,"I was very disappointed in 'Only in your arms'. The reason was... it had a shallow plot and the characters all lacked depth. I saw nothing in the personality of Lysette to draw the eye of Jaded men, to love her. She was just too flat! And Maximillien supposedly put off by any love relationship... because of his cheating dead wife fell for Lysette with no effort, sweetness or even a personality, on Lysette's part. Her personally was wishy washy with no real strength and depth to her character! And Maximilillen's sons held no charisma for me either, like most children in a book do! Also, Maximilliens Mother was a colorless character, as was every other character in this book. They are all very unmemorable, as is the plot! Don't judge Lisa Kleypas's other books by this poor effort, she has some very good reads out there."
5,Excellent,"I like most of Lisa Kleypas's books, but this one was exceptionally good. I liked the characters and made me want to go back to 1805 New Orleans. I loved it!"
1,Are We Reviewing The Same Book?,"I am puzzled to the good reviews for this book. I read half of the book and decided to forgo finishing it. I didn't care for either character and the plot was just plain stupid. I was suckered into buying this book because I liked her other book "" Someone To Watch Over Me."" Save your money and pass on this book."
3,Very loose,"A pretty bracelet that would go with most dresses or suits due to the various colors in it. I thought it would be snug as it's ""stretchy"", but it's not a tight fit. Slides up and down your arm."
4,A review of the Author more than the Book,"I studied under Dr. Santy at the University of Texas Medical Branch around the time the book came out. She is an excellent instructior who could make dry facts come to life. She did not require us to buy her book, for which I am eternally grateful being a poor student at that time. She did review much of the information with us in her lectures. Having that view of the subject and knowing her style, I am sure it is an excellent reference for anyone involved with that field.Steven Wilson MD UTMB Class of 1977"
5,Loved it !,"Yes there was a lot of filler in the book however the information that i needed was available.All that really matters to me is can I apply these ""Switch words"" in my life.That is what makes the book worthy."
2,teh Secret of Perfect Living,The book was bound incorrectly for the first two chapters. this should have been told to the consumer to make an informed choice to purchase.
5,"Incredible, never would have figured out myself","Just great, I enjoyed it,at first I was skeptical but it works.The author has key elements in playI recommend it highly"
4,A find for devoted Free fans,"This lavish five-disc box set is mainly for serious Free fans. It does include most of the band's best known songs, but only a few of them are in their original album version.Listeners who are less than totally devoted to Free will find that ""Songs Of Yesterday"" is sort of an alternate version of the band's legacy, and those fans would be better off with ""Molten Gold - The Free Anthology"". But those who already own Free's original albums will find this box set to be a treasure trove.Most of these 80 tracks are alternate takes, remixes, or live recordings which weren't used on ""Free Live"", offering a wealth of interesting material as well as a fresh look at Free's music. A very nice purchase for diehard Free fans, but not quite right for most other listeners, since it doesn't work as a proper hits collection (and the price is _very_ steep for an 80-song set)."
4,Free Fans Only,This set is loaded with great stuff for the Paul Rodgers and Free fans. My favorite disc is the live disc. The others are loaded with all sorts of alternate versions and singles verions etc. Good stuff if you already have all of the Free CDs which I do. If you don't then I recommend them over this set. I enjoy listening to the originals in order of release and hearing the evolution of the band as they morphed into more of Bad Company sound.
1,Unsupported card,"xgi got sold to ati in march.A lot of vendors are selling this card quite cheaply andplacing links to older reviews.But ATI wont continue with this chipset.will drivers for vista be available no one knows?A risky thing to buy if you are going to upgrade to vistaIt works OK on my XP machine, nothing great...But the bummer is that its a 128MB card and i have to spendsame amount when vista comes out later"
2,don't waste your money,"By the time I got to the bottom of the bottle, I had lost count of all of the tablets that were broken up inside. It's obvious these are not inspected before or during packaging. These tablets are very hard, so to be broken up, they had to have been broken before they were put in the bottle. Also, this was not the case for only one bottle, but several bottles."
3,An interesting 1977-1983 overview,"As strange as it may initially seem, this is an ideal compilation for fans of Tangerine Dream's early period: very few tracks are taken from pre-1976 albums (causing few overlaps for those who already own the 1970-1975 recordings), and its 1977-1983 overview is interesting in its own right, but not quite impressive enough to warrant the purchase of the individual 1977-1983 albums themselves. In other words, both its strengths and weaknesses make it a solid stand-alone double album. The music on this compilation bears the mark of Tangerine Dream's post-Rubycon (1975) aesthetic, as they gradually leaned away from the vast, evocative and free soundscapes of their early work towards a more structured, mainstream and altogether predictable approach. If you are new to Tangerine Dream, I'd suggest getting the early albums first (Phaedra [1974] being arguably the best entry point); this compilation can then cover their later, somewhat less memorable period."
4,Good Overview,"I had only heard a few Tangerine Dreams tracks over the years. I don't think I ever listened to an entire album by them. But I do like some of the electronic music from the 70s and 80s, particularly Jean Michel Jarre, so I thought I'd give this compilation a chance. Very glad I did. There are really imaginative tracks on here. The music that Tangerine Dream composes can be meditative, inspirational, uplifting, or just plain soothing. Relax and dream, and enjoy."
1,Be sure to ask about the bottle....,"The one I received was not the one in picture...if you are wanting this fragrance in part because of the bottle, make sure to contact the company and see if you are getting the correct (ornate) bottle, otherwise you will received on without the silver leaf accents on the top. The fragrance itself was pretty enough, but I was just as impressed by the bottle design...so don't end up disappointed like me...and get the wrong bottle. After researching, I ""think"" the pretty design is only on the 1.7 oz bottles and bigger...not totally sure though, so be sure to check if it's the bottle design you love. This fragrance is VERY sweet, so if you're not into sweet fragrances you won't like it."
2,nuts to you,mixed nuts are way too saltycashews are too bland and tastelessnot really a bargain price either
3,wtf amazon?,"Why are all the releases' comments in the same window? This makes no sense. The first two WuTang Clan Kung Fu dvd sets are similarly bunched together, even tho they are totally different sets.I rated this a 3 because some of the releases here deserve a 5, and some a 1, but acording to Amazon, it's all the same.Amazon, if you want us to buy from you with confidence, you have to stop listing every dvd release of every film with the same comments. This is totally unprofessional and inexcusable.Every release is *not* the same. Especially when it comes to films that weren't mass-reproduced in either english or widescreen."
1,Not as advertized,"This book is no longer available as advertized.The book is a paperback with no color at all. Supposedly, the online version or a downloadable pdf version (as earlier buyers remarked) is in color. Following the instructions printed on the book cover, you can go to the website of the publisher, where you find that you must provide proof of purchase to receive user and password info. I did that, but I have not yet received even an acknowledgment that my e-mail was read, as I requested (although I received an automatically created delivery receipt, so my e-mail went somewhere). I have sent two e-mails so far.If you decide to buy the book from the listed sellers, may be you should inquire in advance whether they will provide the login information or whether they can e-mail you the color pdf version, especially since the sellers' prices are much higher than the price listed in the publisher's website."
3,What color is that?,"If you're expecting to see color images in what is considered to be the ""bible"" of astrophotography, you'll be disappointed. Don't even look for them in the 40+ page chapter on (get this) Color Imaging. Not sure what the reasoning is behind that choice, but Mr. Wodaski could have served the readers better by provided some color images so we could better understand the color processing techniques described."
5,The CCD Bible!,"From a beginner's perspective, if you are attempting DSO astrophotography on a shoestring budget this book will break your heart! But it speaks the cold hard truth in that astrophotography and shoestring budget in the same sentence is an oxymoron! It does however contain fundamental and valuable information for anyone getting into CCD imaging and is an excellent reference to keep on hand. Love the website and the electronic version of the book is very convenient, just a computer away if I need it. Wodaski's new book has recently been released and I look forward to that purchase also."
3,not a great buy,"I found a couple of things odd about this combo which made me return it -I noticed that the picture tube of this model of toshiba is a little bent on one edge, I went back to the dealer, and all the other TV's of this model had the same problem,(you can easily notice this problem when you are say viewing a horizontal bar over the screen). picture quality of this TV is good (once again, not great!)Also, the buttons on the remote (especially the volume/channel) are very small, also the maximum sound volume on this TV is not much - infact its less , and for those looking an regular TV, size does matter and a 20"" definitely looks smaller on this. The VCR of the system works fine."
2,Not impressed,"Im using this TV for my dorm room and it's probably the worst TV i've seen in years. The pixels are huge and the image is grainy. The colors are okay, but color convergence and moire are pretty prominent making the picture look pretty bad overall. DVD's play okay when a player is hooked up, but the image is still pretty blah overall.The flat screen was nice for about 5 minutes, and then I realized that a regular ""bubble tube"" CRT television actually has a sharper and more well defined picture than flat screen. You don't notice the size of the pixels as much and colors seem to come out better in a bubble tube TV.Again, I urge you to look elsewhere and avoid this Toshiba Flat-screen TV. The only flat-screen TVs I would seriously recommend are Sony Trinitrons which are excellent quality."
2,Disappointing,"This book does not always distinguish between major and minor chords. An F major chord and an F minor chord are both notated as simply ""F"" in Lullaby of Birdland, for example. A major disappointment and oversight. Some songs do distinguish, as can be seen in the ""look inside"" preview. But many do not."
1,unsuited for gigs,"Due the slow index, multi-line titles, and a search method that results in anything but what you wanted, the kindle version is terrible for use on gigs. It takes forever to get a song up and once you do it opens to an empty page except for the copyright notice. You must then turn the page to get to the song. The design for kindle is a complete failure, stick with the paper version (preferably the old 5th edition). For kindle I suggest making your own charts and loading them into your kindle as pdf documents. It's worked great for me. Shame on Hal Leonard for such a poorly designed product."
2,Missing tunes and wrong chords -- find an older edition if you can,"This edition is missing some songs from older editions, and there are also incorrect chords here and there. I've checked, and previous versions of this book have the correct chords. I recommend looking for an earlier edition. Here's hoping that the publisher does a little more quality assurance for the next version!"
3,missing some tunes,"This has a lot of what the illegal real book has but is missing some tunes that really make it frustrating - more semi-recent stuff like Chick Corea ""Spain"" just aren't in it (I learned this at a gig when a tune I didn't know that was missing was called.) If you are hoping that this will serve as a replacement for the illegal version, you are wrong - but it does have the VAST majority of the tunes."
5,excellent resource,This book contains a wide variety of songs from a diverse range of musical periods. The arrangement is easy to follow and is most helpful to any musician.
4,Great for the rising generation! Is going to be the new standard.,"This ""Real Book 6th"" edition is going to be the new standard. ""The Real Book 5th edition"" is difficult to find and it costs more than the legal version. Even though the song selection is very similar, it is different. The purpose of this is to replace all the 5th edition real books; it is not here to replicate it. The reason I give this four stars is because gigging musicians who need to replace a worn out 5th edition cannot go to this book as a replacement. (Even though most gigging musicians should know someone who sells the 5th edition)"
4,Excellent Jazz Fake Book,"For those of you familiar with the original Real Books, you know they are both illegal and replete with errors. With this series, Hal Leonard has obtained the proper permissions for the standards all jazz students need to study. He has also supposedly corrected the transcription errors of the original Real Books and added a few tunes that weren't in them. However, though I am far from an expert, it is my opinion that certain errors appear in this book as well, though they are few and far between. I subtracted a star for that reason. This particular book is the pocket sized version of the full sized Real Book by the same company and has all the same tunes in it. I own both. The smaller one is, however, highly readable and a lot more portable. The truth be told, you can do with just this one without owning the full sized one too."
4,"great fakebook, but missing tons of standards","a great recreation of the original (illegal, ""underground"") Real Book. the lead sheets have clear, bold notes, and the pages are never crowded. the tunes are in alphabetical order, and all fit one to a page (or, in the case of longer ones, on facing pages). essential riffs are written out (like in ""Seven Steps to Heaven"").good selection of standards, but for every commonly played tune they include, you could name two or three equally well-known tunes that are missing. this is a pity, as you'd love to make this the only fake book you'll ever need."
2,Read the titles before buying,"There are a number of editions of The Real Book. The Sixth Edition contains less familiar tunes and jazz standards. If you are looking for a fake book with less familiar tunes, this might be what you're looking for. If you like more familiar tunes look for the Second Edition."
4,The power is in the ubiquity,"This collection of tunes may only have 20-40% that you recognize but it is still a powerful resource. I use it two ways: one is as a practice source where I essentially randomly open it and then page through sequentially playing tunes for 20-30 pages and marking (by turning down the page corner) those that I like the most - after a while I just move to the previously marked pages for further practice emphasizing tone and interpretation. The second use is related to the ubiquity of it in that many small ensemble players have the version for the key of their instrument and it can be valuable using it as a base when small ensembles are forming. Personally I like to have C, Bb & Eb versions available, in part because I'm a doubler, but also for more spontaneous settings."
2,Missing important tunes..,This is not like the old fake books.. Many important jazz tunes missing. Newer crap tunes instead.. that I would never play.Great price .. but lacking.
3,Not for me,"A very well copied book, just not for me..the songs are too old for me to know. I was hoping to see Pop Tunes turned in Jazz or light jazz. This isn't it."
1,Kindle Edition???,The kindle edition is selling for ten dollars MORE than the paper book? That's outrageous. Talk about a rip off.
5,A Necessity for Jazz Musicians,"Put simply, if you want to play jazz, you need to know the tunes in this book. My guitar teachers have given mixed reviews of some of the arrangements of the tunes, but nonetheless, the Real Book is a must-have for any serious jazz musician."
3,Avoid the Kindle edition!,"I bought this hoping to leave my badly beaten 5th Edition at home and just bring my iPad to gigs. Without going into things like missing songs and strange chords on Blue Bossa, which I was prepared for, I ran into a HUGE problem with the Kindle edition. All of the 2 page songs require a PAGE TURN. The lack of page turns was a selling point in the Real Book so much that it's mentioned in the introduction. So now I've invested just shy of twenty bucks in a book I can't reliably use on jobs. DON'T BUY IT. On the Kindle. The paper version is fine as long as you correct some chords and just learn to live without the songs in the 5th edition."
5,great collection!,"This really offers a great collection of jazz songs from the classics to the more modern songs. It features some tunes from cool jazz, be-bop, California, East coast, as well as some much earlier creations."
4,Book Review,"Great Book!!!It has great standards, easy to use and well indexed.I am having so much fun. A great exchange for the price.I wish they had words for the lyrics but that would make the book thicker."
1,SONG LIST,"I would very much like to know the names of all the songs contained in this book BEFORE I decide to buy it.How may I access the ""contents"" page listing all the songs in this book?PETER de NIESE"
3,the real book sixth edition,"In general most of the music arrangements were fine. I found that a numbersuggested ""solos"" and inferred it meant solos from other instruments to be performed, and I play professionally SOLO."
5,Very useful,"A must for all musicians, very useful tool for budding artists.of all the music my eyes been squinting at, this is likeputting on shades. eyes are like "" ahhh! "" I can READ! with you-tuber & Panda Oraas your guide, one can go to music collage for under $30 -...sorta...kinda. the rest is, how bad you want it :) so get back to work!"
3,Fragile,It falls apart very easly but other than that its good. I just wish it was more durable for every day use
4,One of the coolest 3D puzzles I've assembled very challenging.,This puzzle was very fun to assemble.Hard to find a good place to store it because it's so tall.But it glows in the dark as promised.
4,Intriguing Book about Commanders-in-Chief,"Bob Greene has penned a very readable work about five past Presidents: Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush I. Instead of asking them the age old questions, he asks them things like: ""what is your favorite movie?"" and ""do you shop for clothes like a normal person does?"" I sensed he took them by surprise with many of his questions. You get to see a side of these men you have never seen. The saddest part of the book comes when he goes to interview Reagan right after he has made his Alzheimer's announcement."
2,"Good picture, but apparent quality control problems...","We received our Toshiba 36A40 shortly before the holidays. After spending most of the day on the phone trying to get through to Toshiba, a technician will be coming to pick it up from our house this afternoon. An overall beautiful picture is marred by several ""dead"" pixels and a strange, persistent ripple effect in two areas of the screen that are distracting during bright scenes. I'm not too thrilled, since moving this VERY heavy monstrosity in and out of the entertainment center causes damage to the wood each time. The service center says they've had several of these units come in over the past several weeks...and it will be a few weeks before we get the TV back, depending on parts availablity. Ugh."
1,says pack of four,"the title of product clearly states pack of four, but only received only one. The deceptive wording makes this a horrible review"
5,Belly Dance Basics,"This is one of the few Belly Dance videos that worked very well for me as a beginner. I was looking for something to teach me the movements in a way that is easy to understand, and Amira did a great job.She breaks the movements down for you so you follow along, then you put it altogether. The pace was perfect in terms of my trying to learn how to do belly dance.She has a good personality and makes you feel like you can do this as she brings you along. Really nice set and music. If you are a beginner, this one really works."
5,Great beginner's bellydance!,"I love this DVD! I had been wanting to learn bellydance and also hopefully trim my waistline. I am so glad I found this DVD on Amazon. Amira is a great instructor, the routines are easy to follow, and you really get a good workout! There is so much more to the movements in bellydance than I had ever thought. There are subtleties of movement that make all the difference, and let me tell you, you will find muscles in your waist, stomach, back and hips that you didn't even know were there. All the movements are extremely controlled too, so you end up keeping your muscles tight and drawn in at all times, which helps with toning. Plus, the workouts are fun, and you get to shake your hips and feel a little sexy! I highly recommend this DVD!"
1,no good,i bought this for my girlfriend as a gift because i knew she was interested in belly dancing and had always wanted to try it. unfortunately she thought this dvd was useless in really learning how to dance. i feel bad for even getting it for her now because she was so disappointed. i'm going to see about selling it and try to find a better one.
3,Basic,"I'm not terribly experienced with bellydancing, so this video was good just as a reminder of some basics. However I will say that if you have any passionate interest in learning bellydancing that you will lose interest quickly with this DVD. The bonus live performance is probaly the worst I've ever seen especially by someone that has their own DVD for bellydancing. Very beginner-ish. VERY. It inspires no creativity."
5,Absolutely great buy!,I'm very new in the world of bellydance and I truly needed something which would make me continue what I started a little while ago- learn how to belly dance. I took couple of classes and it got very confusing with the end result of belly dancing being too hard and unreachable for me. Then my husband got me this DVD trying to help my dream come true. I was amazed how well and in a sweet simple manner Amira tells you exactly what and how to do and also what not to do. Plus I was surprised how good of a workout I got! With the help of this insturctional DVD I got back my desire to really learn the magic of this dance style! Thank You!
5,Evaluation of Writing Fiction from Gotham Writers' Workshop,"This is an excellent book. I find the information useful in writing my first novel. Currently I am concentrating on forming and acquainting myself with my main character, and this book is outstanding in this element of writing a novel. I am even considering taking some online classes offered by Gotham Writers."
4,Practical Inspiration from Gotham Writer's Workshop,100 Ways to Improve Your Writing (Mentor)This is a well written and easy to follow guide to writing fiction. Starting from the very beginning of learning to write fiction the book provides simple exercises and thought provoking techniques which will help you unleash the writer within.
3,OK but not a text,"The Gotham Writers Workshop: Writing Fiction is alright. There is quite a bit of useful information in it, but it is not a text book. There are chapters on all aspects of writing fiction from characters to plot to POV and more. Each chapter is written by an instructor at the school, presumably in his or her area of special interest. If you have a comprehensive text on writing fiction, the thing to do is write the tips you get from this book in the margins of the text, where you can easily find it."
5,Book helpful; classes not so much,"An excellent primer to hone your writing skills. The short story offered, Cathedral by Raymond Carver, seemed to me a weak and amateurish example to hold up, but the advice is very sound and practical. Teachers of the Gotham Writers' Workshop trade off in each chapter, expounding by turns on their areas of expertise. They address common problems for beginning writers and offer practical help for resolving those problems. I found the chapter on Theme particularly useful (it is provided by Terry Bain). The book concludes with a useful cheat sheet to help focus the novice writer's work. My only experience with the Gotham Writers' Workshop was overpriced and offered little to no practical help or feedback on my writing examples. So I can't recommend them based on my experience -- just get the book and work on your own is my advice."
2,New Writers Look No Further!,"This superb collection of fiction how to's developed out of a series of writers' workshops that started small, grew and expanded into a full-fledged writer's program. Terrific and detailed chapters on plot, structure, dialogue, characters and more give you the bare bones of learning how to write great fiction. Gives lots of examples from great works of fiction, as well as writer's prompts. I have read and taken notes on all areas, and it has been like having a group of personal mentors! Great investment."
2,Champions Now and forever,This tape documents Duke's dream run threw the 2001 NCAA tournament. This route was in fact the same route taken in 1992 when they won it all that year. This video does an excellent job of giving a complete summary of the two final four games and the championship game pitting Duke agaisnt Arizona. Still I found this video to be a let down due to the fact it does not show the complete NCAA championship game. This video is over seventeen dollars but is only fifty four minutes. If it had shown the entire championship game it would of been worth the cost but it did not. If you want to see championship game worth your time and money get ESPN classic.
4,Decent,"This is an album that you would rather choose certain songs from. There are very good songs but not every one is that great. I highly recommend, Hide Away, Sacrifice, Watch Dem Roll, and Sticky. But that's about it..."
2,Excellent compilation - What happened to the VIDEOS??!!,"As a fervent Dancehall and Reggae fan, this series has been on my must buy list for several years, even though I often already have all the tracks from purchasing other VP Records releases earlier in the year.I was very disappointed that the videos of these songs, so many of which have benefitted from the recent wave of inexpensive video technology and look so good, were omitted from this compilation. Yes! There is a DVD included, but NOT ONE MUSIC VIDEO, which over the last couple issues has become a coveted part of the collection. In fact, this is the only reason why someone as avid a collector as I am would pick it up.I love the music, but if you're getting this for the vids, STOP right now."
2,Not impressed!,"I was very disappointed in the CD. When I ordered a Reggae CD, I was hoping for actual Reggae. This CD is more of a hip hop CD, so if you are a single guy and like to throw parties in hopes that everyone will shake their bootie, this is a perfect CD, but if you are actually interested in reggae, I would look for another CD."
5,coolremixes,wow all the remixes are great.The feeling so good are okay but these are just awesome.buy it now
3,Okay I guess.,"Book was informative of birth in forign cultures, so at least I got something out of it. It was by no means a nail biter though."
1,Double Trouble!!,I have now returned two of these thinking the first one was defective. Well I now think they all are. The second one went to lockup quicker than the first one. I got so I'd carry two compasses to check this thing out and - please take my word - don't trust this thing unless you have a cell phone to call for help. DO NOT BUY!
4,Hell's own collection of rare tracks and live performances,"Although this 1990 collection has been updated by the two-disc set from 2002 (""Time""), it's still a good deal: live Voidoid performances, studio tracks recorded in New Orleans, and rare Heartbreakers material. The well-crafted studio tunes are as close to pop as Hell's unique vocals will allow, and his version of Dylan's ""Going Going Gone"" is an unexpectedly great cover. The live Heartbreakers material is marginal quality at best, but historically their inclusion is beyond question; the only difference from the first disc of ""Time"" is that you won't get Hell and Thunders blistering through ""Chinese Rocks"" here. Otherwise, this collection is a blast from start to finish."
4,Works fine,I was under the assumption this had a batter back up in it. So I was a little disappointed when I got it. Then I reread about it and realized it was my bad on that. But other than that it seems to work? Its one of those things that is hard to tell if it is really doing anything for you?
5,Great starting point for a new Home Theater,"The H10 Power Conditioner came in pronto from Beach Audio.Well packed and in perfect shape. Hooked it up to a new LCD HDTV, AV receiver, Blu-Ray player, DVD/VCR combo, cable set top box, and a CD player. It handled all this equipment without even a hint of an overload. Don't know if it shows video/audio improvement over a std powerstrip (no comparison done on the new setup), but I like that my stuff is protected by the H10.The picture and sound are great btw.Pretty blue lights on the H10 too ;)"
4,APC AV H10BLK review,"APC AV H10BLK Power conditionerGenerally the product operates very well,however there is a great deal of faith required. The indicators tell you very little about problems that the product has detected.It would be nice if there were trouble codes to tell the userwhat event specifically happened and why. This would give theuser a much better idea if they have a line problem that shouldbe looked into or, if there is a problem with the unit itself.My unit for instance keeps going into a ""trim"" mode. I think I know what this is but HOW MUCH is the unit trimming and why??Again the system seems to be working correctly if one puts their faith in ""idiot"" lights.APC AV H10BLK Home Theater 1000VA Power Filter and Conditioner (BLACK)"
2,lens clear,gpt items on time but way to much on price i thoughti was getting 5 but only got one..i can buy them locally for 1.26 a piece
4,$30 and a DREAM...,"$30 Film School is, quite simply, a MUST READ for any novice or amateur contemplating making a film. Especially artists' with little or no money who have no where to start from. This book is a great and AFFORDABLE springboard to launch from. Why? It contains a lot of information(Technical, Artisticaly,and Movie Biz-wise), provides a step-by-step overview of the whole filmaking process, and kicks you the REAL DEAL about the challenges you may face on your journey. Most importantly, it offers creative solutions to get around those challenges.Personally, what I liked most about $30 Film School was it's fiercely independent attitude and ""Do-It-Yourself"" resourcefulness.Filmaking and creating art in general may not always be a glamorous endeavor but the useful info., tips and insight provided in $30 Film School will help you better navigate though it, and ultimately, get your ""art"" into the WORLD!"
5,Outstanding Motivation to get that film Done!,"First let me say that Michael W. Dean's book ""$30 Film School"" was the inspiration I needed to finishing my film ""Deadly Obsessions"". Michael puts it ALL together in his book and tells you that YOU can make a movie and get it seen by many, and not bankrupt your savings in the process. How Michael descibes marketing your films is simple and to the point. In essence he cuts throught the crap, and gets real. Had this book came out before I started shooting my film I would have saved myself much time, grief, and money. Even if you've shot your film already Michael explains the DIY method of marketing that anyone can understand. Buy this book and take it to the next level you won't regret it."
2,"Some good info, but...","I just purchased this book as a primer for a high school video production class that I will be teaching this fall. It has some great, basic information on lighting, camera angles, etc., but there is far too much useless information in this text. Do we REALLY need to see screen shots of the .mp3's the author has on his hard drive? Earlier in the book he writes a paragraph about the fibonacci sequence, after which he writes, ""Nothing in the preceding paragraph was important, but it was fun."" Wow.Those things, plus the advice on how to buy a computer, what to do about spam (????), and constant name-dropping make this book overly long and tiresome to read. It would've been much better to leave this stuff out and charge $15."
1,i'll never get those minutes back...,"and not to waste too many more minutes on it, suffice to say this book left me unimpressed; poorly written and poorly executed. there was nothing of value in this book to me. do not waste your money."
5,Everything You'd Want To Know For Only $30,"I bought this book, not really knowing whether I could even spare $30. But I held a copy of ""Filmmaking for Dummies"" in one hand, and ""$30 Film School"" in the other at a local bookstore, and made a valuable decision... $30 Film School it is! I have since bought ""Filmmaking for Dummies,"" and Dean's book is 100x better.He clearly, yet humorously conveys just about everything you'd want to know about filmmaking, and I only had one question that I didn't find in the book, and when I asked him, he pointed out that it was in the book, but I had just missed it. So don't skim any pages, it's all good.This is a ""must buy"" book for any aspiring filmmaker."
5,A must for film makers,"I co-own a film company, 4 Horsemen Films, LLC and Michael Dean's book has been a godsend. It is incredibly indepth from start to finish, through all aspects of film making: from writing and producing through exhibition and distribution. This is a must have for any film maker at any skill level. The book encourages great art and cements digital film making as the ""new folk music"" for our times. The included CD ROM is loaded with useful information including videos, sample budgets and even contracts that you can copy and use! I recommend this book to any and all film makers as an essential tool to help you make great movies."
4,Good Ideas,This book is good if you already know some of the basics of film making. It was worth the price and inspired me to do more work.
5,A Fire Re-ignited,"I started collegeto study film and got discouraged and didn't go back....at least not for film. I changed my focus tobusiness studies and have been a banker for 16 years,but I've never been satisfied. When my kids found outwhat my original course of study was they chided mefor abandoning that pursuit. I recently took mydaughter to the library and while she was gettingbooks for her lit class I found this book. It's almost like having a revelation! I am now anxious to start my first video project in 20 years! Michael Dean's book is the catalyst. It's well written and very informative, not to mention entertaining. I have no idea how my project will turn out, but I can guarantee you that had I not read this book, my video would have never been undertaken.A MUST READ for anyone who thinks you have to belong to the club before you play golf."
3,Wow...,"I bought this book...for...30 dollars and now i want it back! Dean really isnt that great of a writer...Not to mention the simple fact that if Hollywood never excisted we wouldnt like films...I dont understand why everything has to be so Hollywood Bashing these days. Dean is a prime example of one of these types, if he wasnt lauding himself for his ""DIY"" tactics he was talking about about how ""Punk Rock"" he is or even ""Those Hollywood rats..."". i honestly think that Hollywood rejected him...so now he vents his anger through the book.Sad."
3,Cheerleader on Acid,"Though this book is self-promotional of Dean's one solid film credit, is a pulpit for his opinions and you will still need a book on filming techniques afterwards, it over-doses on his gusto and enthusiam for art -- Enough so that you too will want to grab a camera when finished. Also, it does a competent job of an overview and does give several tips that I haven't seen before.If you're looking for a technical book on cameras and advanced filming, this isn't your book. If you need inspiration and motivation, then buy it."
5,Buy this book...,"Buy this book... If you can, buy two or three and pass them out to your friends. I have never - I repeat, NEVER - read any book as fast and as thoroughly as I have with Dean's ""$30 film school."" He proves that art is in the desire to create, not in how rich or influential you are.Dean writes from the heart, in this humorous, pleasurable, and uber-informative book. If you've just started learning about film-making, buy this book. If you've been doing it forever, buy this book. If you like movies and have a camcorder, buy... well, you get the point.I can't recommend this book enough. If I could give ""$30 Film School"" more than 5 stars out of 5, I would. So, seriously... buy this book, get out there and create art."
4,Good Price for Children Who Will Play with It,Bought this for my nephew- within a few hours his siblings had the top busted right off- it's plastic so not very durable at all. The rest of the tractor is metal so that's good!! Very good price for the value.
3,Found a solution for the #1 problem,"This phone system is not bad for the price and the fact that installation and complex wiring is completely unnecessary. A voice mail alone for a phone system can run $1000 to $5000 alone. The voice mail in this system is not the greatest but beats a regular answering machine in many ways. The biggest problem with these phones is the keypad. It goes bad in the phones after a few years depending on usage. You have to find a replacement, have yours fixed, or purchase an entirely new system. Look for a repair company that installs an improved keypad NOT the original because Panasonic still to this day sells the same keypad with the same problem. Unfortunately there are a lot of companies perfectly happy to repair your phone with known defective parts just to save a little money."
3,"Good phone, Poor battery life-replacement.","This Panasonic Cordless Phone has many great features. The only down side is battery life and finding a battery replacement. My 1st battery expired within warranty time and Panasonic replaced it, took them about 2 months to get the replacement. Now my 2nd handset battery has expired and a replacement cannot be found. Panasonic will not even take an order for their HHR-P506A battery nor is it available through their retailers. This could be a 5 star item if not for the battery life and replacement. Stay away from this phone until batteries are available. Without the battery this phone is unuseable."
2,"Issues, issues!","I've had this phone system for about 2 years. I first purchased the base unit and one additional handset. I had to exchange the handset right away because it wasn't working properly, the base unit didn't recocnize it. After that issue was resolved everything worked fine, other than the slight annoyance that you can't turn the ringer off.....About 6 months ago the #1 stopped working on the handset which is more than just annoying it makes the handset virtually unusable, except when answering calls. I've resorted to using the caller ID/redial feature to make calls to phone #'s with the #1 in them...I can see now from reading other people's reviews that this is not a unique problem & is obviously an engineering flaw. I'm going to contact Panasonic Customer Service & see where that gets me (hahaha). Overall, I would not reccommend this phone system, for the high price (I paid over $450 for the base unit & 1 handheld unit) and all the problems I've had....don't bother!"
3,Great Phone BUT.....................,After searching for a replacement handset thinking that my kids broke the phone. (the #1 does not work on two out of 5 phones!!!) I am now learning that this is unfortunatly common.
3,Phone life,I have had many problems with my phone. I have only had it for 1.5 years and no one can hear me. I have to reset the system each time this happens. Has anyone else run into this problem?hipcheckjeep@yahoo.com
5,The people are so friendly Maun!!,Hello Maun! Hows It going Maun! is the greetings this country offers and the kids walk so far to go to school but the hike up the mountain and the view are awesome.
3,Decent,"We were tryingto replicate a family handme down. It did the job, but wish they were a little cuter."
3,Not bad but not great,"I was looking for a good Santoku knife to add to my collection and after reading a few reviews and looking at a few different knives I decided upon this one.Well the knife its self isn't really that bad. It has good balance and feels fairly comfortable in my hand, always a plus. The handle all though very comfortable and easy to grip has a very cheap look and feel. The knife was definitely not as sharp as I like my knives to be so I had to sharpen it. A big negative in my mind!Overall I'd say for the $19.99 price tag its not a bad knife just don't expect greatness."
5,Great speakers for the price,"I've been listening to these speakers for over a week and am highly pleased. My previous system was a sony stereo system 120 watts per channel. Not only do these speakers have better quality, but they are louder.I don't normally write reviews for products that I purchase online, but I figured since I was so pleased I should share my experience. Definitely use good wires to hook these babies up or you wont exploit their full potential. The RTi's have good bass but I feel like I need to add a sub to feel lower frequencies. When I turn the bass up it's too straining on the speakers, hence a sub.Can't wait to add a sub to this banging setup! No regrets!"
5,Very nice sound for small speaker !!!!,"I was replacing my old school Technics cabinet speakers with these. I heard them in the store and found them very impressive. Once I connected them to my Sony receiver I was totally amazed. These speakers are WELL worth the money and can be mounted right on the wall. Reggae and Metal sound really good, with very good surprising bass response. I am very happy and would recommend these speakers to anyone."
3,They're good,"I wanted to get speakers that would blow me away and these did not. They sound good don't get me wrong but I guess for $150 nothing will blow you away. My expectations may have been too high and that is not the speaker's fault, that's mine.I paired these up with an Onkyo tx-609n. This is better than buying an HT-in-a-box system though and you don't NEED a sub with these..really you don't. You may WANT one...hell, I want one but I have tenants in the basement and the speakers are ""decent enough"" in the bass area especially if you're sitting in the sweet spot. What I mean by this is they may not rock your world with bass but they can suprisingly pound for what they are.Would I recommend buying these for someone who wants cheap speakers that sound great? YES i would."
4,Good mid range but less bass,"You get what you pay. For the price, this is the best. However if you are music lover, buy the one with more bass or a subwoofer."
5,I loved this book,"I loved both of these characters. Lindsay was introduced in ""Secrets of Midnight"". SHe goes to London for her Season and meets the dashing Jared. Well, I won't write what the book is about but I loved these two characters. Lindsay is a naive, sheltered girl and she believes everything Jared says. SHe believes he is a spy for England but she finds out he isn't and she still won't give up on him. I thought Jared was a beautiful man, with a torturous past. I recommend this book. I believe you should read ""SEcrets of Midnight"". Even though they are both stand alone books. Corie and Donovan make an appearance in this book and I always love to read books where you can revisit the characters from previous novels."
4,Good Read,This was a light and enjoyable read. I read the first book in this series...Secrets of Midnight...and was interested in reading Lindsay's story. The first story introduces the Lindsay character and she seemed so sweet that I wanted to read her story. It was worth the read.
4,Great Quality,"Jon Schmidt draws the listener in with his very intimate style on this latest release.He displays an intuitive sense throughout this album that is always sensitive but never overly sentimental; dramatic but always exuding warmth.There is a reflective quality in Schmidt's performance of his own melodic compositions like ""Longing,"" ""Solace,"" and ""Big Sky Sunset."""
2,Too expensive? Don't waste your money!,"FYI: This same movie is available far, far cheaper under its pseudonym title ""Dragon from Shaolin"" here:Dragon From ShaolinThis movie, originally from 1973 (and also know as ""Survival of the Dragon""), stars Li Chin-Kun as the main character, and Bolo Yeung as one of the bad guys (who gets the stuffing kicked out of him!It is a pretty bad kung fu movie - below average in my opinion - with lots of annoying close-ups, but it does have several scenes of pretty good kung fu fighting. The never-ending final scene (which does not have Bolo Yeung in it) gets to be too much, though; we have two guys pounding and pounding on each other and just continuing forever without sustaining much damage - it actually becomes really tedious.Li Chin-Kun is a highly capable fighter, though, and worth a look for the dedicated kung fu aficionado. Another of his movies, ""Chinese Tiger"" (available cheaply at Amazon.com), should be really good."
1,Unable to get clear focus with this lens,"I have tried every possibility of camera settings, tripod, remote camera release, automatic focus, manual focus, varying focus settings and have been unable to achieve any results worth even keeping. I do better using the built in camera lens and enlarging the photo.I'd be very interested to talk with anyone who has been successful with a Panasonic camera and this lens."
1,Too Much Tool,"This was purchased as an additional wood hook, to compliment two others I use for my personal firewood work. I bought my other wood hooks in Maine (they are almost as common as candy at the grocery checkout), but could not find them here in Maryland.The Northern Industrial Log Hook is a quality product, but it is about twice as heavy as each of my others, longer, and cost about twice as much.I returned it because it was simply too much tool for my application."
3,OK - but definitely not worth the money! buy something else,"I just bought this case on sale for about $18. I haven't had any problems with the Tungsten falling out, and I also find it easy to open up the Tungsten using the opening on the back of the case. However, I would never pay full price for it, and wished I had bought something else.SBK"
1,terrible,"did they actually put the pda in the case when they designed it? terrible! continously falling out. i'm not really fussed about all theresulting scratches my T3 now has, more about the fact that some idiot designer probably got paid to design it!"
1,Bad Design,"I am very disappointed with this case. After having a tight-fitting case for my old Handspring, I expected nothing but the best for my new T3.The Palm doesn't stay tight in the case and thus, half the time it falls out in my purse or briefcase.I will be looking for somethine else."
2,Not so tough!,"This hard case for the new Tungsten T3 is not as tough as it looks! Yes it is sleek and attractive, and it will protect your Palm from inadvertant key strokes, scratches and light wear and tear. It has two downsides: 1) despite little latches to hold the Palm in place inside the cover, the pda pops loose rather too readily. I generally carry my pda in its case inside a purse, briefcase or tote; as a result of normal jostling of these items, I often open the hard case to find the Palm ""floating loose"" inside. This has forced me to make some rather atheletic ""saves"" as I open the case and the Palm starts to slide out and fall. 2)The case itself doesn't have a secure closing. I discovered this when it fell from my desk, popped open and I watched my pda slide across the carpet (thank goodness it wasn't asphalt!)So this case gets high marks for style but low for substance. Let me know when Palm comes out with a case that will afford real protection."
1,"I wish you had a ""zero star"" category","This case has been discussed at great length over on the user forum on the PalmOne website. It all boils down to one thing: the case does NOT protect your T3. In fact, it won't hold it in at all. You can try to bend up the springs a bit, but this doesn't solve the problem entirely and eventually the springs will break. I'm really surprised that this got by their quality assurance testing."
1,Very poor design,"The design of this case is nothing short of terrible. As all other reviewers have noted - and as all other users have no doubt experienced - the case does not securely hold the T3 and it allows the unit to slide from the case and onto the carpet - or cement - or car floor. In short, it is a piece of useless junk that an interested user should walk away from quickly.Other design faults - such as the nearly impossible way in which you must slide open the T3 to access the graffiti area - are merely irritants when compared to the fact that the case fails to fulfill its main function (that is to protect the T3)."
1,Palm Can Pop Out Easily,"I agree with most of what the other reviewers wrote with one exception. My case has a very secure cover latch. It is spring loaded and closes nicely. I don't even mind the large cut-out. The T3 is held in place by a leaf spring on the bottom of the case that pushes up VERY GENTLY on the palm and allows the two plastic hooks on the back of the case to engage in the mating slots on the back of the palm. In my opinion, there simply isn't enough pressure to keep the T3 secure. It frequently pops out, making the case a temporary solution until I find a better one. I rate myself 1 star for not reading the reviews, like you just did."
1,I have to agree--a turkey.,"Cheesy looking faux plastic, instantly waiting to spring-eject your palm through its humongous top maw.I would like to add that it is also very difficult to open the T3 up to full-size with this case: You have to dedicate one hand entirely (typically the left hand if you are right handed) just to holding it in (I should say ""on"") the case, and the other to gingerly extending it out without unseating the device from the case.A disgrace."
1,Waste of $$$,"Jeez, what a waste of money. I have to mirror the other reviews (and I wish I would've read them before I bought this piece of crap): The case rarely holds my T3, it's flimsy and badly made, and, frankly, I doubt it would protect my T3 if it were dropped on a pillow. Pass on this one."
4,Fats was a rare talent,I read this and thought of our stays in Harlem. We were at a BnB on Garvey Park but walked to some of Fat's haunts. The book captures the era and vibrancy of his work and his rather careless lifestyle. Very well done.
5,A MUST have for any art fan,"I recently purchased Spectrum 9, 10, and 11. These books are absolutely wonderful, and I would recommend them to any artist or fan of fantasy/sci fi art. They are extremely well put together, of high quality (reproduction wise), have a large number and variety of artists, and contain some of the most beautiful works of art I have seen. Some of the subject matter can be disturbing or somewhat sexual in nature (certainly nothing explicit, but not exactly innocent either), so I wouldn't recomend them for the very young (12 or under?) if you are a parent. These books are worth every penny and highly recommended."
5,A real treasure,"If you love Hawaiian music, then this film will touch your heart. It traces the history of the Sons of Hawai'i, but more importantly brings to light why Gabby Pahinui and Eddie Kamae are so important to the culture, but in different ways. You get to see indepth interviews with Moe Keale and Joe Marshall, both now gone, and so many great stories about the Sons, of kupuna who helped save the music and memories of Gabby.Mahalo nui loa to Uncle Eddie for producing it and for releasing at an affordable price."
1,Liar,"Kelly Flinn was not ""forced"" to resign, she accepted a resignation because she knew she would be convicted. Her crime was not ""falling love with the wrong man,"" her crime (in addition to adultery) was disobeying a lawful order to cease the relationship. Kelly Flinn and the feminists who love her saw her case as another example of an out of touch military hell bent on railroading her promising career. Hogwash. The reality is that she was given several opportunities to end the relationship. She instead chose to disobey direct orders. Rather comforting knowing that she was piloting nuclear capable aircraft. She played the media card and boo-hooed on 60 minutes. The Air Force, in an effort to protect HER privacy, kept quiet. It cost them in the PR battle, but they won the war, because Flinn no longer wears the uniform. This book is spin at its ugliest, don't waste your money."
1,What a joke,"You've got to be kidding me. The Air force entrusted this woman to fly nuclear bombers, she stole an enlisted girls husband, lied about it, cried on national TV, and now she's a hero? Whoever believes that she is a victim has no idea of the facts in this case."
3,Flinn got a Raw Deal After all was said and done.,Flinn did not deserve the treatment she received based on the recent exploits of the Commander in Chief. It would only be fair to say that the Commander in Chief receive the same treatment for sexual misconduct as his underlings. Flinn a highly trained pilot became a role model for women in and for those thinking about joining the Air Force. Often finding herself alone in a highly charged sexual enviornment she made a few mistakes that thousands of others have not paid the price for. She was singled out for extremely harsh treatment - she should have received compassion and perhaps some counseling. In any event she should have been allowed to continue flying for the Air Force in the USAFR or the Air National Guard. What a waste of a great talent. Just think she could have been dropping bombs on Yugoslavia or whoever needed bombs dropped on them as dictated by the Commander In Chief.
5,Powerful and Revealing,I found myself drawn in by Kelly's writings. She has gone through hell and come out stronger. All women considering the military should read this book. I found her writing to be quite professional and was surprised there was no co-author.
4,"It's Not the Adultery, Stupid","Even though it's written by Kelly Flinn, the book raises other important issues. This book should be used as a guideline not for raising questions about the Flinn or similar cases, but for analyzing the support structure of the military. Liike the odd suggestion of the counselor Flinn talked to at the Air Force Academy."
5,I was surprised ...,"I started taking niacinamide because of a claim that it could help with memory. Though I noticed no effect on my memory a number of very troublesome arthritic symptoms disappeared. Quite surprising to me and quite dramatic.Now I find claims of naicinamide helping with arthritis are common on the Web. If you bop around on the Web a bit you can find quite different ideas about dosage. This product exactly fits my needs and corresponds well to the regime suggest by some on the Web. Since when I started out the timed release version was not generally available I was having to approximate the effect by taking smaller doses many times a day. So grateful for the timed release version. I now only take 2 tablets a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. There's another company that sells a 1000 mg timed release tablet here on Amazon, but then I'd have to take 3 a day. I wish Amazon would add it to their free shipping and ship it at regular intervals."
1,Usless,"Notwithstanding the suggestion that this basket is by or for Mr. Coffee, it does not fit in my Mr. Coffee machine. It is, therefore, useless."
1,not as advertised,"The filter I received was different than the one in the picture. The box says ""Mr. Coffee"" however inside you find a filter which is same as the one sold at Walmart (another brand, but exactly the same item) for almost half of the price."
5,Excellent fit in my Black and Decker!,No more paper taste!This is a good investment to improve the quality of your coffee!Paper is stupid!Buy one.
2,disappointed,i have used a similar type of filter in the past that i was happy with-this one is to small and the coffee grinds will overflow while the coffee is brewingneeds to be a larger and higher on the sides
3,Mr. Coffee Permanent Basket,The basket is okay. Permanent makes you think that it does not have to be replaced. Wrong. The recommended use is 30 days.
3,Okay,"I love not having to use paper filters. However this particular model has a full, hard plastic bottom (no filter). This causes our Mr. Coffee machine to back up a little and sometimes overflow. I'm getting a new one that has a filtered bottom. I also couldn't find the dimensions of this product, so I measured myself. It is about 4.5"" x 2.5""."
1,Lets grounds get through,grounds in the coffee when done! The filter let grounds into the the canister. We had to go back to the paper ones.
2,not totally happy,"I purchased this because it seemed like a good idea -- some folks claim better flavor and of course there is the ecological reason. However, those reasons will not keep me from going back to my brown paper filters. We did not like the grit left at the bottom of the pot using this filter, and we didn't like the oils we could see on top of each pour. Maybe this makes coffee taste better, but I guess we thought it was fine before. I'll use this only if I accidentally run out of paper filters."
4,Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-style Gold Tone Permanent Filter,"The filter arrived, as promised, and in good working order. I'm happy with the current construction of this filter, even with it's plastic bottom; it does the job well and appears durable. Only time and usage will tell, of course."
1,Dont Buy This - waste of money!,"AS other reviewers said, this has a solid plastic bottom which causes the grounds to flood over into the coffee pot. I have been using it a week and every pot of coffee has a number of grounds in it. I make 8 cups every day, today was the worst as the entire bottom of the pot was covered in a thick layer of grounds. I had one of these 15 years ago and loved it, so I thought I would purchase another one. The old one has a mesh bottom and I never had an issue with it. What a waste of time and money!"
2,Permanent Filter - hmmmm,"The product I received is NOT what is pictured. there is no handle and it is very messy to remove this basket from the coffee maker. Also, a lot of silt passes through and you get a mud puddle in the bottom of your mug. I have to use a paper filter as well just to keep my coffee drinkable."
3,Does what it is supposed to do,"I bought this because a review of the coffeemaker I was buying said that sometimes the paper filters collapse and grounds go down into the coffee. This product keeps that from happening, which is what I was looking for. Also, this product will save money in the long run since I would not have to keep buying paper filters.However, I don't like the taste of the coffee when using this basket as much as I like the coffee made with paper filters. That's why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars."
1,"Poor Product, Not Original or Clean and Doesn't Fit","This product was only a couple of bucks, so my review seems like much ado about nothing. Except, the product was not as advertised. It was advertised as ""Mr. Coffee GTF2-1..."". It is NOT a genuine Mr. Coffee product. It arrived as a loose item, stuffed into a bubble-wrapped envelope. There was no product packaging at all. For a product supposed to be used with something I drink, it's lack of individual packaging was downright unsanitary. And, on top of that, it didn't appear to be clean; there was some sort of small spot on the basket when I held it up to the light.And, maybe worst of all, it didn't fit my brand new Mr. Coffee coffee maker."
3,Plus and minus,"I like that one does not have to have to buy paper filters that often allowed some grinds to overflow. However, the downside is that the permanent filter is a pain to clean out. All in all, I prefer the permanent one."
4,Doesnt spill over. Works great!,"I was worried about the solid plastic bottom causing spill overs because of the other reviewers complaints, but we have had no problems. Our Mr. Coffee maker is over 5 years old and I rarely do a thorough job cleaning it so spill overs caused by poor maintence shouldnt be a question really. The reusable filter fits like a glove, so if yours doesnt fit perfectly there might be reason for problems. The entire filter feels flimsy especially the handle but it is easy enough to just rise off and place back so I'm not really concerned that it will fall apart anytime soon. I wish I had bought one of these sooner, because the paper filters would fold over leaking grinds in almost every morning. This will save money in the long run and it's much more environmentally friendly."
5,Coffee filter,This is EXACTLY what I needed. No more paper filters that leave a residue taste in the brew. Highly recommended for any coffee lover who has a machine which accommodates this basket-style filter. DWRumsey
4,Decent Filter,"I'm happy with this filter - it does the job it's supposed to do and the price is fair. It would be better if it had a mesh bottom, and it takes some rinsing to get all the grounds out after use, but it works just fine for me. To be fair, I don't use it daily... probably more like 1-2 times each week. Overall, a decent product that saves me from wasting paper."
1,Makes awful coffee,"The price was great, the shipping wonderful - the product itself is worthless! I have used it numerous times, scrubbed it, ran it through the dishwasher, and it still leaves a cloudy residue in the coffee pot - not grounds as I first suspected, but just a residue - yuck! I won't use it any more."
1,Mr. Coffee 4 cup permanent filter did not fit,The Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter did not fit into my Mr. Coffee 4 cup coffee basket. The filter is cone shaped whereas the coffee maker's basket has straight sides. One would think that a small Mr. Coffee filter would fit a small Mr. Coffee coffee maker. But that was just not the case. I have yet to find a permanent filter for the small coffee maker.
1,Terrible terrible terrible,"If you'd like a duct collector you've come to the right place. If you want something to make coffee with then click away, now, seriously don't buy it."
1,Tried to go green but...,"I was excited to get this little basket so that I didn't have to use filters anymore. When it arrived I immediately washed it out and made a pot of coffee. When I went to get a cup I discovered it had overflowed all over the place and worse yet, I had coffee grounds from here to kindgom come. I had to throw away the coffee because a lot of the grounds got into it, clean and wash the coffee pot, the coffee maker, my kitchen counter and the floor...not what I had anticipated...I just wanted a cup of coffee...not to go on an unneeded cleaning spree in the kitchen that I had just cleaned earlier that day! I washed it and packed it right back up and gave it to the UPS man when he arrived the next day to deliver a package for me!!! I'm now back to my paper filters...so sorry trees, I tried!"
1,"Not good, unless you like coffee grounds in your coffee cup!!!!!!!","If you only brew 8 cups in a ten cup coffee maker your coffee will be mostly grounds free. However, if you proceed to push your luck with the engineered full 10 cup capacity of your 10 cup coffee maker you will be greeted with coffee grounds in your coffee pot + 2 cups of coffee and grounds on your counter top!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm just guessing mind you, but I would say brewing the extra 20%, which is pot capacity, is spoiling my whole pot of coffee plus I get to clean up the mess on the wife's counter top. this not a win win situation for me and my new Mister Coffee maker plus Gold Tone Permanent Filter.Mistercoffee GTF2-1 Basket-style Gold Tone Permanent Filter sucks!Unhappy +VirgPS Your Mistercoffee Maker is Pretty though."
1,careful you purchase the correct size!,I had no idea that the sizes were different. This is too small for a Black & Decker.
2,Design problems,"Our previous coffee maker, a Cuisinart Model DCC-1200 series, let us use both the paper coffee filter and the gold basket coffee filter. This made it easy to grab the paper coffee with the used grounds and put the grounds in the garbage without spillage. We liked having the procedure of using both the gold basket and the paper coffee filters to minimize dropping coffee grounds on the counter or floor. The designer should have been requiredto use the coffee maker and a competitors coffee maker."
3,"""Fits most"" -- but not Cuisinart","I'm sure it's a fine filter --but those considering this item for a Cuisinart Grind & Brew coffeemaker should be aware that it will not fit those machines. You must buy the Cuisinart gold tone filter instead (diameter of the Cuisinart item is somewhat smaller, and bottom is mesh which is necessary for the grind/brew to function properly). Just a word from experience here--I bought this one first, because it's a few bucks cheaper, but had to return and buy the other instead...."
5,Great coffee Filter,"I use these Filters in my Camper, Home and furnished rental homes. Empty, rinse in hot water and use over and over. Less mess than paper filters and no Grinds in my coffee.Works with most brands of coffee makers too. Try them you will not go back to paper filters. I also use it to brew tea."
5,Works,"What's better than an everlasting coffee filter? Fits great into the unit, no hassle. Easy, simple, lasting. I recommend this product!"
3,"Expensive, but go the job done.",New coffee pot = $25replace lost filter = $13 + $5 shippingBarely worth it.
3,it works but is hard to clean,it filters the coffee well but it is hard to clean out after using it...it arrived with the handle half on and half off one side was off and it was very difficult to attach it. I thought this would be a great way to avoid wasting all that paper with filters but you need to clean it out with something to get all the grounds out so using more paper with paper towels...anyone who knows an easy way to clean this item please let me know.
2,Not so good!,"Well, I got a new coffee maker and they ""suggested"" the permanenet filter.. So I ordered two (one for reserve).It looks nice and it's handy but.. frankly, the holes in the filter are too big. They don't look big but they let the water thru to quickly and my coffee comes out pretty weak. I compared the taste with the paper filter and with the permanent filter a few times and paper blows it away! I love good coffe and don't like the permanent filter at all. However, it is handy to strain small amounts of veggies at supper time :-)"
3,review,It is a great product. The only problem is that you should wash it several times until it gets clean.
2,Mr. Coffee GTF2 Filter Basket,"I bought this permanent filter to go with my new Mr. Coffee BVMC-SJX33GT. It is about 1/4 inch smaller than should be and the water filter that comes with the coffee maker barely fits. I had to take the handle off of it. Not worth sending back so I am keeping it. If you want a permanent filter, I suggest that you try and find one that is a little larger.Mr. Coffee GTF2-1 Basket-Style Gold Tone Permanent Filter"
2,Mr Coffee Filter,I just purchased a new Mr. Coffee maker that came with a flimsy coffee filter. I purchased this one which says it is a Mr Coffee filter and shows a Mr Coffee box it comes in. What you really receive is a filter that is not in a Mr Coffee box and has no reference to the Mr Coffee brand. The water filter cartridges that came with my new Mr Coffee maker would not fit in this smaller version filter. I had to remove the handle on the new filter just to get the water filters to kind of fit. Not happy that the pictures on Amazon don't match what you actually get but I was not expecting a lot for less than 6 bucks.
1,Not a bargain.,"I have to use twice the grounds to make my regular portion of coffee. If the bottom of the filter was wire mesh instead of solid plastic, the filter would probably work as well as a paper one."
1,GUNK!,"I purchased 2 of these Mr. Coffee permanent filters as ""stocking stuffers"" to go with the same brand coffee makers for Christmas. I was tired of the paper filters occasionally collapsing, so I thought this might be a good alternative. I was wrong!When we started using these a few days ago, the coffee that brewed through them contained a thick sediment that collected at the bottom of the coffee decanters. This happened no matter which type of coffee that was brewed. The filters are not filtering this gunk out of the grounds and is instead depositing it in the coffee!"
3,Filter basket so-so as filter,"This basket lets a fine residue through, and I'd rather be able to drink my entire pot. Cleaning is simple, but unlike the quick toss away of a paper filter, it must be rinsed clean after each use. After a week, I went back to paper filters."
4,Coffee filter,"Works well, easy to clean.I dont like using paper filters because you lose some of the important coffe essence."
2,Does not fit GE coffeemaker,"It did not fit my GE 12-cup coffeemaker. It was much too shallow for the basket cavity in the coffeemaker. I don't see how this item has sufficient volume to handle 12 cups of coffee. As others have remarked, the bottom is solid plastic, which would tend to impede the outflow rate of the brewed liquid."
5,Exactly what we needed.,This filter is a universal filter and fit my coffee maker. I no longer need to use paper filters. It arrived promptly.
1,"Do not like, always get coffee grounds in my coffee","Thought this would save me some money on filters, but each time I have used it I have had coffee grounds in my coffee. I do not advise you to purchase this item, continue to use the cheap paper filters."
5,Lifesaver!,"So happy I don't have to remember to buy filters anymore, I would always forget right when I needed them!"
3,CAVEAT EMPTOR!!! NOT completely universal!!!!,We bought this from a local retail store that rhymes with Target to fit our Hamilton Beach Brew Station and it does not fit. SO make sure your particular coffee maker will work with this or else its a late night trip to the 24 hour convenience store when you are jonesin' for that late night cup to allow you to go to sleep...or maybe that's just MY problem!Couldnt really give it one star since I couldnt truly review the product but dont want my fellow Amazoners to fall into this and have to ship it back.Cheers!Joe
2,Know your needs first,"This ""Gold Tone"" filter is OK for some people I suppose. Since one would have to wash it in the disahwasher or by hand, everyday coffee drinkers might want 2 so that when 1 is dirty the 2nd can be used. It was unusuable for us though. It will not take fine ground coffee without leaving sediment in the pot and therefore in your cup. The instructions say coarse ground coffee should be used but you don't know that before you buy and until you read them! Paper filters are inexpensive and work well."
3,Not what I had hoped for,"Because of the occasional mess from collapsing paper filters, I purchased the GTF2 Filter. It does NOT filter fine particles and you are left with an unpleasant sludge in every pot. Changed the grind twice, but to no avail. I went back to paper filters. I'll now use the GTF2 to strain paint so all is not lost."
2,Mr Coffee basket,We have had other baskets for other Mr. Coffee makers but this one is only 2 weeks old and the lining is ripping along the side. My other basket was cone shaped in my old coffee maker and was a year old before the coffee maker broke. I may give it another try but I am going to look around for another brand first to try.
3,mr coffee gold tone,"The service was good, prompt and communication was also good about the shipping. The filter works well. we were hoping for a filter that had mesh on the bottom of the filter as well as the sides. We couldn't tell from the photo if that was the case. The filter does have a solid plastic bottom so we were a bit disappointed. The filter does fit our Mr Coffee coffee maker and that is the important piece. We are satisfied with our purchase though not delighted."
1,Solid Plastic Bottom Causes Flooding!,"Thought this would work properly in my Mr. Coffee coffee maker, but I was wrong! The basket, due to its solid plastic bottom, can't filter fast enough to keep up with the incoming hot water, so the coffee grounds float over the top and go unfiltered into the coffee pot, and the kitchen counter. What a mess!"
3,Nothing special,There's nothing special about a permanent coffee filter. It works and it works the way it is supposed to. I would recommend.
1,Not the right filter!,Do NOT order this for a Mr Coffee or any REGULAR coffee maker! Amazon should not say that it goes with these products. It is MUCH too small! It appears to be for 6 cup coffee maker.
4,What I wanted,"This is just what I ordered and it is fine. But next time, I will order a basket with more spines to lessen denting the mesh."
5,No more paper filters,"This is a great product if you are trying to lower your carbon footprint in the world. It has saved me money and is easy to clean, and it is universal no matter what brand of coffee maker you have as long as it is has a basket and not a cone shape. I highly recommend you get one. I got two."
2,This filter is not 100% effective,"Having purchased this permanent filter with a new coffee maker only three days ago, we were immediately disappointed with it because of an oily film-residue appearing with every cup of coffee. It wasn't until less than an hour ago we discovered that this film-residue problem was directly related to this filter. One writer put it this way: ""The metal filters don't trap the fine residue found in ground coffee as well as paper filters."" We tested this by pouring 4 cups of recently brewed coffee directly into and through a paper filter. Voila! No oily residue in the cup, but the paper filter was black with the oily debris."
3,Great Unsung Group From Chi-town,"Finally, a CD of Artistics sides. Since I wore out the vinyl albums these songs first appeared on this CD is greatly appreciated. It's nice to hear a good vocal group singing to good rhythm tracks and not much else. The sparseness makes their soulful vocal blend stand out even more. A few of the songs do have strings including the standard ""With These Hands"" and the Chi-lites sounding ""Just Another Heartache"" which Chi-lite lead singer Eugene Record wrote with Barbara ""Love Makes A Woman"" Acklin. If some of the Artistics Okeh sides had been included this would be a five star special."
3,Coughlin's sources,As the manager of [...] and writer for other sites on Iraq I can say that Coughlin is well connected in the Middle East and his views are worth hearing.
1,Terrifically biased,"Well, someone had to justify the almost totally unjustifiable (ie a 'liberation mission' for the Iraqis ends up killing over a million, producing mass homelessness and poverty, food and power shortages, etc) Iraq War. Coughlin attempts so here, portraying Saddam as a man just as draconian as Hitler and Stalin, claiming he funded and organised a large part of al-Qaeda and saying a load of other made-up rubbish with the intention of shocking the reader to the degree they would support the Iraq War. Don't read this."
3,medium service,"I would like to review this transaction. This transaction was the change of the first transaction, as the first transaction was not successful with the reason out of stock and difficulty to contact the seller.So, with the feeling of not so happy, I made another transaction, and this was the transaction.Fortunately, this transaction was working well, so it could fullfil my transaction.finally, thank you for the service."
5,perfect!,I was very satisified with this cd. It was just what i ordered. I've listened to it several times. Thanks!
5,Terrific,"Great, great music that you can sing along too. Joyfully passes the time in traffic or at home relaxing. I received it on time and it was well-packaged. It was a great bargain!"
4,Air Supply,This is a very good music cd. Air Supply has some very good songs and this cd contains many of them. If you are into soft rock then this is a good buy.
5,JZ,What a great bunch of songs. These were great songs then and are still now if you are a fan of Air Supply during the 80's.
2,Poor sound for good songs,"Air Supply, The Best of Air Supply, contains most of their popular hits, but the sound quality is poor. I don't claim to know how CD's are mass produced, but this one sounds like it was burned on someone's inexpensive home computer. It sounds thin and tinny. If fact, it sounds just like a few CD's I burned years ago with an inexpensive home computer."
2,Be careful.,This DVD player doesn't play VCDs. SD 1200 does play VCDs. I am wondering why Toshiba doesn't make the SD 1600 to play VCDs. I'll have to return it.
1,Warning! Does not play CD-R!,"This is a great machine, though please don't make the same mistake I did. I didn't read the fine print before ordering. If I had, I would've learned that this machine IS NOT compatible with CD-R. That is unfortunate since it is a new machine (shame on Toshiba). I gave one star so people would notice these comments before ordering. Otherwise it is a 5 star machine.You have been forewarned!"
4,Very reliable DVD player.,"This DVD player is very reliable, and very easy to use. It is perfect for me, and I love it. The audio and graphics are perfect for what I need. It's a very good choice for the money. The one thing that I would've liked that it doesn't have would be arrows on the front so that I didn't have to have the remote (which I always lose) to easily start a movie without having to go to the menu, then stop, then play, and so I could also navigate the menus. But, if you can keep a remote, and you would like a good, [reasonably priced] DVD player, this is for you."
3,Mixed Feelings,"This is a great player, it's got everything a dvd beginner needs. The zoom feature is great, the picture is outstanding, decent connections, multiple advance speeds and decent restart speed, but... I can't stand the way it sometimes freezes. It may only be for a split second but, the picture holds for a split second too long. This happens about once every five movies. It's not the end of the world, actually a lot of people don't even notice it at first, but if you want an awesome machine, don't get this one. If you're a beginner and want a decent machine to watch dvd's while you save up your money for the HDTV and a premium system, this is the player for you."
3,"Good for the price, can be better","I bought this DVD player from Amazon some months ago. I was able to connect it to my TV and receiver in few minutes without any problem. It's working very well since the first moment. The only problem I found is when I jump from one part to the other of the DVD: it's very slow. For example, it takes 10-15 seconds just to start a new DVD, and if I want to jump to a different item of the DVD menu I have to wait 10-20 seconds. Also, if you plan to use it to play CD, as I do, you have to know that it will not recognize sub-index entries (used in some classical music CD) and you will miss a random play mode."
2,Nice starter but missing a few things,"This unit does not play VCD's and for some reason it's kind of slow loading up certain DVD's. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. Not a bad beginner system, but after a few months, you're going to wish you spent just a bit more to get more."
3,Does not work with CR-R or RW format,The 1600 works great unless you want to use it for video formated CD's and recorded CD's.
4,Toshiba SD-1600 DVD video player,Someone said that it didn't keep the last spot viewed for more than 20 minutes in a review I read. It was my experience that after stopping the DVD & coming back 3 hours later all I had to do was hit play & it started from the last place viewed. The key is to only hit stop once. If you hit stop twice then it'll reset to the beginning. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because this was my first DVD player. It definately was easy to hook up & they supply all you need to hook up. I preferred the smaller remote that fits snugly in your hand. I am recommending this item to friends & would buy their products.
4,does not include dolby digital decoding,"My receiver has 5.1 audio inputs for dolby pro-logic but I couldn't use this DVD player with it because it doesn't include a ""decoder"" which would provide the 6 audio outputs you need. I'm upgrading to the sony that includes the decoder. Otherwise it seemed like a good unit. The dolby digital systems are incredibly confusing and not explained very well on amazon."
1,Dissapointed,"Features are sub-standard, many of the good reviews are obviously first time DVD owners that don't realize the full potential of other comparable DVD players. This player also doesn't play ""home-made"" VCDs on CD-R's. With the capabilities available today to make VCDs of home video or photo-cd type disks, this is an important feature that was left out. I would suggest looking at alternate players if you want to make your own CD-Rs to play."
3,Things to keep in mind.,"The unit works great, but there are three things to keep in mind:Doesn't play CDRsDoesn't have an optical outMade in china"
1,Garbage,Remote control only works within a couple feet of the machine. The unit is not compatible with my Sony universal remote. Perhaps just mine is a lemon.
2,Read this before buying a Toshiba SD-1600 DVD player.,"I bought the Toshiba SD-1600 DVD player for Christmas. We rented the Art of War (a new release with Wesley Snipes) and the disc could not be read by the machine. I called Toshiba and they told me that I would have to send my machine in for an upgrade because for some reason this model can not read this movie. This is just something I think you all should know as consumers, because who knows if it will have problems with other movies as well."
3,Decent Unit,"Overall this is a nicely finished entry level DVD player. There was one quality control issue: when I unboxed the unit and started to use it, the music CD I was playing started to skip like crazy. I ejected the disc and few a huge glop of white grease on the cd!The ability to enhance the black level is a nice feature. I am bummed that it won't play CDR's but that would be my only real complaint. There isn't an optical output on the machine, something that would be nice to have as my receiver has more optical inputs than coaxial. I rent DVD's from Netflix and there are times that the player gets so locked up I have to literally reboot it (and skip over the troubled section)...I imagine that any DVD would do that, but it is frustrating none the less.In closing, you might want to consider the Apex DVD player which is able to play all sorts of discs. I have several friends who have been extremely pleased whith their players. One super nice feature on the Apex is the built in MP3 decoder!"
3,Disappointed Texan,"I read the reviews and bought this Toshiba SD-1600 DVD player rather than Sony. I am disappointed and would return it if I still could. I can hear the motor during silent parts of the movies, and the zoom is not very advanced compared to newer models from other manufacturers. Also, this player doesn't seem to handle transitions of layers very well. There is always a very noticeable pause. I also had problems watching 'For Love of the Game' (no scratches) as the player just stalled on one scene toward the end and would not advance no matter what I did. I ended up having to restart the movie, and watch it from the next scene onward. I haven't tried 'The Matrix' yet, but understand that it gives DVD players a good workout. Thinking about the Toshiba SD-1600? Think again and buy the Sony or another maker."
4,I've been very happy with this DVD player!,"I bought this DVD Player last Christmas. I'm not technically knowledgeable about what all is available in DVD technology. I did some research, liked what this model offered, and purchased it. Being not technically knowledgeable, I appreciated the ease of set-up and use. I have been using it for 7 months now and am very happy with it. I've read comments about some people being unhappy with the noise the player makes, but I have not noticed any such noise. The unit is quiet and easy to operate."
3,"completely in French, as advertised","What you're looking at here is a made-for-TV movie, an Italian-German coproduction that aired in 2003.Anne Valle stars as Princess Soraya Esfandiari, the Lady Di of pre-Revolutionary Iran. The movie has nothing to do with ""Soraya,"" the Columbian-American singer who died of breast cancer in 2006.The title you see above is accurate: there are no English options. All of the audio on the DVD being sold here in French, and there are no subtitle options in any language. I have no idea where this comes from, or why an English-language version has never been available."
5,Kenshin Strikes Again,"As any one out there who has seen Kenshin before knows, this series is great. This movie is no different from the rest of them. I love the series and the plot contiuation in these episodes is great. If you haven't seen Kenshin before, you don't know what you're missing. It is excellent animation with a winning plot line. Don't take my word for it. Buy the first video 'The legendary swordsman' and see for your self."
4,Slowing of the plot,"Kenshin has an excellent plot line all throughout the episodes, regardless of this particular video. I enjoyed this set of episodes, but the plot begins to stretch out in a style that is more reminicent of Dragon Ball Z (my least favorite film). It is for this reason that I cannot give this episode set a 5-star rating. Otherwise, the plot line stays in tact and the action begins to get better. Unfortunantly it takes more episodes than any dubbed Kenshin movie so far."
4,A must-have for southwestern travellers,"I used this guide in my trip 12 years ago, and it was very helpful, before and after the trip."
3,this set hasn't aged well!,I have had my set for five or six years and the tube is going wrong. for a $600 tv that is $100 per year. I remember sets when I was young would last forever.
4,review,"If you have plans to take a walk through the golden fields of Apollo, this might be good music to put on your ipod. `Soundtracks for Sunrise' is an epic voyage through a dreamy world of psychedelic folk and ambient electronic humming. Imagine that The Flaming Lips died from a tragic acid overdose and Paul Simon and DJ Shadow were in charge of the funeral music. Now imagine that, in the middle of the funeral, The Flaming Lips got up out of their coffins, set up their instruments, and began to play an improvised set of joyous celebration. If Paul Simon and DJ Shadow joined in, this album might have been born. Luckily, Mr. Winston Giles saved everyone the trouble and just made it himself. The native of Melbourne is rumored to enjoy red wine, sunshine and most other things that make people happy. This album is for sunny days of all seasons."
1,Not even worth the money,"Considering this was a rather cheap item...it was still not worth it at all. The receiver malfunctions approximately half the time I use it. The keyboard functions about half the time, and the mouse is just terrible. When by some miracle it functions, it is not accurate at all. Also, the GearHead customer service is ATROCIOUS. I would not recommend this product at all."
1,**** DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! ****,"You get what you pay for was my experience! Worked for 1.5 days and then just died! A ""0"" star rating would have been more appropriate but wasn't an option."
1,Mouse is a big problem,"The keyboard is working fine but mouse is a big problem. It says that laser mouse is 35 times more accurate than optical mouse. I have not seen such a bad mouse (optical or trackball one). There are no CD with drivers. Their support site has a button for downloading drivers, which does not function.Hopefully somebody from GearHead would read this review and take some action."
2,it's true you get what you pay for,"I would not recomend this product at all. my problems with it are as follows.1. very noisy to type with (advertised as extra quiet)2. my right arrow key has stuck from day one so i cant playquake on it unless i change from the keys im used too.3. I bought this for use with my tv room computer but the mouse will not respond if more then 3 feet from the reciever.4. I have to press the reconnect button for the mouse everytime i power up the computer, keyboard always stays working though. i have noticed others have complained about this too.i would not recomend this at all. logitechs have always been good to me i would go with them."
3,Good value,"This is basic Ibuprofen, works good. It is hard to beat the price offered for this item at any local store."
4,med review,"Bargain price for the product - unfortunately with the company's expensive shipping, any savings was lost."
3,"SOLID PERFORMANCES, POOR PRODUCTION","I am a Wagner traditionalist, so I prefer my Wagner operas in their proper context; with correct sets, costumes, etc. I suppose it is to Wagner's credit that his operas can be as altered as they are, but it is not my preference - especially for a DVD.This production is set in the eighteenth or ninetheenth century, it seems, based on the clothes and stage props. I think this significantly detracts from the original medieval Nurnberg setting and its relevant aspects of that caste society, guilds, etc.The NY Met performance with Siegfried Jerusalem remains my favorite."
4,holy rolly guacamole!,"I could not believe my eyes when I saw this. I purchased it almost the second I came across it, I bought it instantly!It got to me in THE MAIL like 2 days later!!! I was so thrilled I thought the thing would contain tacos! I was upset wedidn't get to make tacos though :("
3,FAIR BOOK,"I was disappointed in the miniscule amount of information provided in this book. There are hundreds of marks, but almost no information that is helpful. With that said, I am a beginner, so my opinion might not be the best to rely on, but I would certainly not recommend this book for beginners like myself."
4,A great dance tune,"Coco's voice is powerful, especially track 2, the remix is incrediable, one mind to remind you, she's not the second M. Carey and the way she pesents is totally different. Buy this record and enjoy yrself!"
3,Good reference,"I found this book useful, especially if the reader has some knowledge of the French language. It is best used a reference. It is not a book on medical French."
4,"Clean and light, long lasting","I received this item as a birthday gift. I'm very picky about fragrance, and I prefer a subtle, clean and natural hint of aroma to overwhelming ""perfumy"" smells. I wasn't too happy with the way this smelled when I first sprayed it on, as the immediate effect was a bit artificial and strong for my taste, but I was pleasantly surprised that it settled down into a nice clean and light scent after a few minutes. I can barely detect it myself (as it should be!); it reminds me more of that fresh out of the shower feeling, but my husband still noticed that I was wearing a new scent right away, and he liked it so much he couldn't stop nuzzling my neck! It lasts all day without having to re-apply."
2,questionable sale,"First off I ordered two. Was charged for two, but only recieved one. Called and was told the other was on back order. Then why was I billed for it? I cancelled the second one and I am waiting to see how long it will take to charge back the other $44. Second, the description says for dragging and carrying logs. On the box and on the tongs themselves it says not to be used for carrying. Hmmm, false advertising on Amazon?"
4,Filling a Slot,"This season i order was to fill a slot for the show, couldn't find it anywhere in the place i live, got a band new copy here and it was exactly the way they said it was and the shipping was on time. Glad things worked out so well more so sense it was cheaper then they normaly are also"
3,Not worth the price.,"I love Inuyasha, but this is ridiculous, even with Miroku's prayer beads.How can you justify paying over one hundred dollars for some cardboard, plastic, and less than 20 episodes?"
4,INUYASHA SEASON 4 BOX SET,"THE ITEM ARRIVED DAYS BEFORE I EXPECTED IT, IT WAS IN GREAT SHAPE EXCEPT FOR THE PACKAGE, WHICH WAS STRICTLY THE US POSTAL SERVICE'S FAULT FOR FORCING IT INTO A MAILBOX WITH TONS OF OTHER THINGS WHICH CAUSED TO PACKAGE TO CRINKLE AND RIP BUT AS FAR AS AMAZON AND THE COMPANY THE SHIPMENT CAME FROM I was very pleased. THANK YOU!!!"
4,Ive Always Loved It,"This series was full of heart, full of mystery, full of action and adventure. The anime is wonderfully written and the soundtrack is superb. The manga is powerful. It contains alot of things the anime wasnt able to give you. There is alot more detail and alot more character elements in the manga. That being said every single piece of this wonderful series is worth buying and Amazon offers one of the best prices youll find to collect it without going bankrupt."
5,Inuyasha Season 4,It was in excellent condition when I got it and I was very please with it coming before the promised date.
3,InuYasha Season 4,I ordered this product from Amazon but then found the same one at Walmart for $50.00 less. I returned the one I bought and they refunded my money.I bought the one from Walmart.Inu Yasha: Season 4 box set
3,Great Show but too expensive for 18 episodes,"This is what your going to get with the box set, 18 episodes, most of the episodes will be comedy based and love based, don't expect much action with this one but you will still enjoy it, you will just have to be ready to spend 75 dollars for 18 25 minute episodes, is it worth it? You decide.Episode content: 4/5Price for content:2/5overall: 3.2/5"
3,"I enjoy the series emensly, but......","I am also concerned about the number of episodes, and that Viz decided to cut the season short by two episodes. The price got my attention also though I suppose they have to make their money."
2,Not too pleased either,"I am not too pleased. This product is overpriced for the amount of episodes. Don't waste seventy dollars buying this - take your money to Wal-Mart where they have it for forty. The episodes are good, but the price is too high. I'll save some money and shop somewhere else."
2,Totally disapointed!,"I was not impressed with this book.I was looking for descriptions of old traditions.The book is more of a calendar. From 1940! It gives very vague descriptions, just enough to tantalize, and then says the last time the custom was observed was in 1940 something...Does include actual photos.This might be useful for a master's thesis on parade practices, but is not of much use to someone wanting to learn about old traditions."
4,A bucket of laughs--if you're mormon.,"BY THE WAY, the movie was PG (as Amazon has it as unrated). The movie is about two LDS singles trying to hook it up with special appearances from nearly every prominent Mormon you can think of. They take every single Mormon stereotype, quark, etc., and exploit it to the fullest to leave your sides aching, if you're Mormon. That's the only real problem for the movie, is unless you make up a part of that 2% of the U.S. population, you're probably not going to get. It does go over the top on its jokes occasionally, but sit back and enjoy the flick! It's worth your while."
4,Singles Ward,My family and I enjoyed it too. For those who are not Mormons: It is a bit like Revenge of the Nerds -- but without the sex and violence!
5,A great mormon movie.,First off if you're not mormon then you probably won't get all the jokes. But it is so funny. I recommend no matter what religion. I think that it does give a good depiction of some of the stereo-types and misconceptions about mormons. If you'd like to see a little about what the mormons believe and have some fun doing I suggest this movie. I loved it.
5,Our favorite LDS comedy for 10 years now,"Still the best LDS comedy ever made - genuinely funny, original, touching and just downright hilarious entertainment. We have watched this one many times over the years and it's one we still dig out when we need a laugh. Still thoroughly enjoying, still makes us laugh all these years later."
2,Had Good Parts,"This movie was better than ""The Home Teachers"" but not nearly as good as ""The RM"". Good sterotypes and some funny scenes, but I saw ""The RM"" first and expected the same enjoyment out of this movie and it was lacking. See if your library has it. I wouldn't spend much money buying a copy."
3,"Okay, not that great","I tried to read this book. It has a lot of good information. I found A J Drew's and Patricia Telesco's styles too different to go back and forth between them, like this book does - a chapter on a god, a chapter on a goddess, and so forth. I got tired of this and gave up."
4,Not a time travel!,"Part of a series dealing with either paranormal activity or time travel, this book brings back characters from Gordon's previous Runaway books. Despite what the editorial review on this site says, this book is not about time travel, but is about magic. Strong characters, interesting settings, and some highly charged sexual politics make for a solidly good read. I welcome the next book in the series - bring on Shelby's story!"
3,I just love the witty characters,"""Sukey,"" as Suannah is called she the funniest, beginning witch, I ever had the chance to read about. How one of her spell crate something entriely different, in what she had in mind. Trying to get a student back into her school, but Luke wasn't very reasonable, as she calls it, for Sukey was talking about his two children.Using her power to make him reconciler. Finally when she won, she had to reverse to spell she place on Luke.Trying to reverse the spell, but the entities, humorist as they are, love to make mortals ""proform"" for them. This is all twisted with Luke's history and all these deaths, which seem the happen when he's near by. Stuck with trickery and Chinese's surrounding, theses two were force to play lusting lovers and end up loving each other. Strange things happens during this story, but truely wonderful."
2,"Bower, not Tiffen","This was supposed to be a Tiffen adapter ring, but it's a Bower. Watch out if you care what brand it is."
2,Not for a beginner.,"Look elsewhere for a beginning point in gaelic. This course seems to be okay for a person that has some gaelic understanding. A beginner starts like a child learning names of things and people and then basic adjectives. The basic verbs come next and then more sophisticated conjugations.The tapes do follow the book but they go too quick driving me crazy pushing ""stop, rewind and play"" to repeat the word. The book gives the sounds of the vowels and consonants but many of the words heard on the tape defy any attempt to construct the same word phonetically as found in print. If you have an apptitude in languages then you could try this method of learning but if you are like most of us - don't! I have studied other languages but nothing like this ancient Gaelic, it has only 16 letters in its alphabet."
4,easy to read but difficuilt to master,"There's a long preamble, the pronunciation is very accurately explained, it runs later.If you have some knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, it can be useful to have a rehearsal in little time; gaelic songs and crosswords are unvaluable.Well, it's everything but an introduction to the language; I would be curious to know someone that has really become proficient only with the aid of that book.If you don't want to forget your Gaelic, try it"
3,Very interesting,"I enjoyed the DVD. I found the host to be a bit annoying, as he seemed to make every effort to be funny, which was not necessary. However, I also found the information he imparted to be interesting and quite helpful for someone planning to visit Moscow and St. Petersburg. It gives a taste of life in those cities, including the local people, food, and places they frequent, along with the normal tourist places you would want to see."
3,Some good basic information,"Having been to St. Petersburg I think some things could have been added about the city and added some more historical places such as Yusopov Palace and Catherines Palace at Pushkin just to name a couple. But at a high level this video was good and the places that were visited were a good choice and the video footage of them were very well done. If you are looking just to get some basic exposure to Russia and little about Russian Culture, then this video is for you. If you have travelled to Russia before and taking in a new city. It is just enough to give you some good sights to see your first few days."
3,RUSSIA DVD,I saw this a couple of days ago. and it was pretty good if you are into the country gave intresting facts and the host is enjoyable. I personally Love the series(globe trekker) they relly give you a feel of how the country is like
2,Entertainment not practical on any level,"The host was annoying, worked way too hard to be ""funny"". Most of his humor fell totally flat. Perhaps the European English speaking market would find him ""funny"". For a host in a foreign country, Ian has a thick local dialectal accent, uses too many colonialisms and non standard words, and speaks too fast. However with that said, there were a few moments that were amusing, and at the end Ian did take a swim in the ice water. If he came off as a goofball, at least he wasn't the ugly demanding arrogant tourist.After watching 4 globe trekkers there is nothing educational about them, there is no way anyone would plan a trip or learn enough about the countries to gain practical advice. If you want to watch a standard plan your travel tv show watch the series Travel With Rick Steves available on Amazon."
4,Midsized Powerhouse,This television offers one of the best feature packages in a midsized tv. If you do not have the space for a larger (more expensive) tv but want the options that the larger sets offer this is a good choice. With the component input you will get the best picture quality possible. Hook this set up to a DVD or Satellite system with either s-video or the component input and you will have yourself one powerhouse of a home video system. If you have a surround sound system you have the option of allowing the audio output to be fixed or variable. This means that you can control the voulme with either your TV remote (variable output) or your surround sound remote. All in all it is a good choice for a mid sized set.
4,Yamaha YZF600R Repair Manual,"I bought a used copy because it was cheaper. Being a repair manual it didn't matter if it was dirty/marked-up, as long as there are no pages missing. Overall I'm happy with the manual, but it took forever to get here coming from the UK."
5,The best part of Kenshin,"If you are looking for the darkness of Rurouni Kenshin's OVAs (Samurai X by ADV) then the series nor the movie will have it; however, Kenshin's battle with Shishio is about the most exciting part of the entire series which spans 90+ episodes. Composing of a good portion of the episodes (i forgot exactly how many), Kenshin's battle with Shishio begunning with the ""Shadow of the Wolf"" and is continued through this DVD, is awesome. It is definitly worth seeing, and the only part i suggest WORTH collecting, but you will not have some of the background of the characters that Kenshin meet during the series such as Sanosuke, Anji, and the rest. So, to get a good view, watch some of the first three DVDs to get a general background on everything and you should be good to go."
5,A new legend is born from the past,"Forget about Marvel, DC or Image comics. Forget about these people with superpowers from an X-gene or coming from outerspace. Legends are born from this world's own history. History made by normal people with amazing skills. This series is the best I've seen since Robotech. Kenshin has a great storyline, fast-paced, with little love stories. Instead of having your DBZ earth special forces, we've got our Tokyo special forces (a legendary hero, a renegade/thug, a medic, a female fencing instructor, and a boy in training). If you like Jackie Chan and Mortal Kombat (the way it's supposed to be), you'll die for Rurouni Kenshin."
2,Did not like,I did not enjoy this product at all. It looks somewhat on the cheep side and I could have gone without the silky look of the pink. That kind of helped with the cheep look.
5,Works great!,Got new laptop with no serial port. Ordered this adapter and its just what I needed. Setup was easy and product works as advertised.
5,Excelent!,Works fine in Window XP and Windows Vista. On Windows 7 i have a little problem solved this way: social.technet.microsoft.com /Forums/en-US/posready/thread/79e08f57-1af4-4281-a448-7dece26cf638/I recommend this product
4,Manhattan USB to RS232 converter - Serial adapter - USB - RS-232,Very handy usb to RS232 converter. It works well with our laptop and boating navigation system.
4,Does the job,Comes with software drivers and with some tweaking it did the job. Well constructed fairly sturdy. I am using it on a daily basis
2,could have been so much more,"Being a fan of Hong Kong cinema, I must admit I bought this dvd with a certain amount of trepidation. This is because it broke new territory - and I must admit the special effects are really impressive. However, the most serious flaw is that the movie never seemed to combine the special effects with the kung-fu action, which I was screaming for all the way through. What a wasted opportunity! There is too much boy meets girl type nonsense going on for my liking. Maybe if they had a Jet li or a Donnie Yen on board they could have done something with this, but I doubt it. Perhaps in a few years time they might get the combination just about right. Until then its The Story of Ricky for me!"
4,"Don't expect Tekken, just fun!","Avenging Fist is the Tekken movie that was never allowed to be a Tekken movie. Namco said no to Andy Lau, so he went ahead and made one anyway.The plotline is neither deep or flourishing, but just adequate for what the movie wants to achieve. This movie is trying to do 2 things, first to show Hollywood that Hong Kong can do excellent special effects, and provide some great action sequences. This it achieves very well, the effects at times seem to go too far, but then when has that ever stopped the gaming industry. The fights are great, although there is obvious use of wires, the action is more punching than kung fu.Do not expect Tekken and you may well be suprised what Hong Kong can do. If you are not a fan of Hong Kong movies, and don't appreciate their cinema then this may not be the title for you."
1,Utter crap,"Ugh. My friend bought this on dvd the other day at a used video store. Why did he buy it? I have no idea. I knew it was gonna be bad news. So anyways, after playing some video games we decided to pop it in and give it a shot. I will regret that moment forever.This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I used to talk about how much crap there is in American cinema, but after watching a few Hong Kong movies, there'e quite a bit of crap there too. This movie was plain AWFUL. Glossed over special effects which were ridiculous and pointless, stupid fight scenes, idiotic camera tricks, and a plot that was made up by a 4-year old. Don't buy this. Don't watch it. Stop reading this review and find something better to do."
5,Excellent Information,The rationale behind a plant based diet is explained in a way that is new to me. It brings many ideas together and the concept of veganism is clearly a healthy and healthful diet. Excellent book.
5,Wake up call,"Wonderful advice, this book can save your life. The true cause of heart disease are trans fats, meat, dairy and processed foods. Stay out of the hospital, lose weight, feel great using this advice. Get this book for someone you love, even yourself. It got my friend off diabetes medicine in two weeks and my doctor lost 40 lbs on The Anti-Inflammation Diet."
5,I lost a lot of weight using this book.,"I lost a lot of weight using the Fleming Program. I'm at my lowest weight in 28 years. It was easy for me to basically follow because a person can eat a large volume of food and not go hungry. The person just has to eat the right foods. The loss came at a rate of about a pound a week. I also lowered my blood pressure, cholesterol and pulse rate. I believe the Fleming Program is the healthiest program out there.I don't usually cook and eat out. I modified the program slightly to fit my needs. The Phase I was quite strict and I cheated on it a little and still lost a lot of weight.Typical eat-out meals that fit some of the program:Veggies with tofu from a Chinese take-out place.Vegetable chop suey.Vegetarian chili.A vegetable burrito bowl with beans.Apples twice a day.Going to a buffet and eating vegetables (except rice, potato and bread.)A veggie delight sandwich from a sandwich chain after Phase I."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I have a friend who swears by this diet, so I thought I'd buy the book and check it out. It will certainly result in weight loss (and the associated benefits of a healthy diet and ideal weight), but, my gosh, 35 servings of fruits and vegetables a day - you've got to be kidding! After I read about carrots being a ""comfort"" food (""Honey, I had a horrid day at work - how about a cup of carrots?!""), I realized this wasn't the diet for me. The book does contain some valuable nutritional information and some healthy lifestyle exercise and dietary suggestions, but I'm not convinced this particular type diet has anything over any other well-balanced diet supplemented with exercise. Good luck with feeling good - however you figure out how to do it."
5,Worked great,"I Used this to coat two tanks for two different 200cc bikes.I did use muriatic acid to clean both tanks before using what was included in the kit.They provided plenty of the sealer, after coating both tanks and letting the extra drip back into the can there was over half left over.It's been a year since I sealed the tanks and one has had gas sitting in it and the other is waiting on me to finish the bike rebuild. Both tanks still look like they did when the sealer cured with no sign of rust.I Highly recommend this kit. Just take into account if your tanks are very crudded up on the inside you might want to pre-clean before using this kit."
3,does charlie need a holiday?,"perhaps not charlie at his best, good beginning and end, lost it a bit in the middle. got to go bombgrade calls"
3,does charlie need a holiday?,"perhaps not charlie at his best, good beginning and end, lost it a bit in the middle."
2,Slow and Old,"Some of his other work is much better. This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters. Because of the light development it does not hold your attention. I just did not believe the characters. I kept waiting for it to get better which is why I toughed it out to the end, but I was disappointed overall."
2,My Review,I didnt think that this book was as good as most . Seemed slowwer paced than most of her other books
4,A Really Good Medieval,I enjoyed this book as it is a very well written story and draws the reader in quickly. The Amazon summary is pretty good but I will add to it by saying that there wasn't too much angst and the relationship between the H and h develops nicely. I liked the side story of the natural parents of the h. The evil plot against the H is interesting. Overall this was a good read that I can recommend.

1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION,"If you're studying Uonamuno for a class, don't buy this edition - you need a critical edition.Furthermore, this edition was totally messed up when it came. They print the book the day you order, so mistakes are made. By page 40 I realized that all the pages afterward were completely out of order... And some are just missing.Spend the extra few bucks on a critical edition - you'll get much more out of it."
2,Not credible,"The O'Brien's Atlas would seem superior, if not for the disqualifying incompetence of rendering Poland reformed & not Catholic; it cannot be trusted. The Hammond Atlas is a reprint of The Times one. The simplistic Atlas of World History by John Haywood comprises 6 parts with a 4-page introduction & 28 double-spread maps each (180 spreads/360 pages in total) in addition to acknowledgments & index. After the original publishing in 1997 by Sharpe, as a 3-volume set (ISBN: 1563248549), it was reprinted not only in full in 1 volume by Weidenfeld in the Cassell's series (ISBN: 030435757X) on 384 pages available to be seen inside at Amazon UK, but also abbreviated in 1 shorter volume with only 121 double-page spreads in color by Barnes & Noble (ISBN: 0760706875) & MetroBooks (ISBN: 1586630997), as well as in full in separate 1-/2-part volumes (some with encyclopedic dictionary spreads)."
1,Disapointing,"This book is a total disapointment to say the least!I'm not interested in farming & agriculture 2500 years ago, I'm interested in historical facts such as wars, kings, quuens, tyrants etc.I wish I could get my money back!"
5,"Not only are the songs Academy Award winners, so is Chacksfield!","If you're looking for some relaxing ""listening"" music, look no further! Beautiful melodies, beautiful arrangements, and beautiful memories! A real treasure! On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this a 12!!"
5,Great CD for Chacksfield fans,"I bought this CD as a gift for my mother who had a number of Frank Chacksfield LPs back in the day. She is delighted with the CD! The Technical quality is superb and the rich, thick tones for which Chacksfield was known come through very nicely."
2,Hard to Recommend,"Though a captivating read, and intensely provocative; I find it hard to recommend the piece as otherwise uplifting and it is hardly appropriate as its content is often lewd and graphic."
4,"Tough Product, Fresh Scent...","I usually pick up this product from the local 'mart, but getting the 3-pack for a better price here was very appealing. This product has multiple uses for the kitchen and bathroom and is a really good cleaner for dirt and grime. It's also great for getting soap scum off that can deposit over time in the bathroom, it's better than most of the other 'scrubbing' products I have used. There 24 ounce bottles are a lot of product for an average sized family. As prices often fluctuate, always shop around to find the best price but this product is certainly worth trying; tough on dirt and leaves a fresh scent behind, what more could you want?"
4,For a survey of World Religions,"Kingley's videos are a good survey of world religions for the middle school or high School level. They are not highly informative and not comprehensive or comparative. But are good, well produced and solid in the information they contain. They are the best available for the middle school level instruction."
4,Joshi does it again.,"For those interested in the details of Lovecraft's work, or those who want an introduction to the Master of the Weird, this is the book for you. Joshi continues the superb work begun in The Annotated H.P. Lovecraft in this volume, though it is not without its faults. While More Annotated contains some of Lovecraft's finest works, there are several of H.P.L.'s weaker stories included. The serious Lovecraft scholar might haved hoped that the space would have been better used. With luck a third volume will issued with those stories that deserve a closer look. Still, this is an execellent book, well worthy of the price."
1,Not very shimmery,"Lotion itself is OK, but if you're looking for shimmer, you're not going to find it here. There is a SUBTLE glow, when you're looking at your skin in the sunlight. Other than that, I did not see any shimmer/radiant glow. I was hoping to find a replacement for the Nivera Shimmer Lotion, and this is not it."
1,Not as expected.,"I was looking for a bronzing or self tanning lotion and this product popped up. I had used a Dove self tanner before but could not find it at the local stores. I was excited to find this product but was very, very disappointed after using it. No bronzer or tanning at all! Smell of product is not plesant at all. I feel I was sold a terrible product. Buyer beware!"
3,Good anime,"This is a decent series if you don't mind not knowing who wins in the end, or even who survives. This sort of makes it more interesting, but did annoy me a bit at first. In fairness, I haven't watched it in subtitles yet and that often makes a big difference. The story is good and an interesting concept, but not absolutely original. There are some thought provoking ideas, but it also has light entertainment, some comedy, and fan service. It is mostly sci-fi based. I would recommend it as a good series for a short evening, as there are only 3 episodes. I do not regret picking it up at all."
1,Worst ever!,"This series popped up under a hetai search. Not one singlr scene is adult! Well, I watched it anyway since i bought it, and as expected, I was very disappointed!"
3,Nice but...,"I got a random call from someone who sounded like they spoke very little English, finally her explained to me that the locket was only available in red but since I had already paid for it and it was a christmas gift I had no choice, then when I got the lockett it was not only a lot smaller than it looks on here but it also came without a chain and the little connecter for the chain. I would have sent it back but my girlfriend had a chain for it and really liked it. I liked it to but I dont think it was worth the money"
3,Lots of the same,"I knew going into this I might not enjoy it. It was written in Fisher's later years and is basically the same story told in earlier books. However, without any of the emotion or beauty of her earlier works."
1,Good for insomnia!,"This book is truly awful! It is a rambling, unedited, boring ""memoir"" that reads like a bad diary. The author comes across as an unlikeable snob. While she is writing about her new husband and talking about her love for him, she throws in a mention of her second husband and later says she was widowed three times and divorced twice. Please! I would give this book zero stars if I could. Unfortunately, I had to read it for one of my book groups!"
1,Piece of crap!,"Not only is this picture of the product horrible and misleading because it looks nothing like it, it also breaks and the jeweles in it fall off. So basically, I paid $10 plus shipping for a piece of crap! I thought it looked really good in the picture, but it looks nothing like it because the picture is alot darker, making the colors misleading."
