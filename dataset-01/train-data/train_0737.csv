5,Joy of Rock,This DVD captures Bruce and the E Street Band going full tilt. I got this for Christmas and spend a very enjoyable 3 hours watching & listening while my kids and wife played with their new Kindles.
3,Camera angles,"I was really disappointed that the camera people spent so much of their time focusing on Bruce. Of course he is the star of the show but the rest of the members of his E Street Band were pretty much overlooked, just a second or two on individual members most of the time. Where would Bruce be without his lifelong friends of the E Street Band?"
1,never mind,"Sure would like to buy and listen to this concert, but of late I've been subjected over and over again to Springsteen's political drivel and have become suspicious of being lectured to. I guess I'll pass a go back and listen to some old stuff he performed before he was convinced that his politics matter."
5,An excellent book for further PowerBuilder learning,"The intro book was excellent, so it was a no-brainer getting the advanced book. The advanced book provided excellent help for me as a new PowerBuilder user. As soon as you open the book, you're already learning plenty of tips that will help you later. Yes, this info is in PowerBuilder help, but here it's all in a nice, consise 'get-to-the-point' format. This book is used in the company's actual advanced class, so you also get a disk with exercises and solutions. The price may seem a little much for some, but for someone having to learn this quickly, which makes sense economically - 1)spend a couple of thousand in some 3 day 'quick' class or 2)spend a couple of hundred and get what you need without leaving your desk? This book is definitely worth it. The chapters on the datawindow report presentation styles (tabular, grid, etc) are excellent!"
1,defective,"This padfolio is a piece of junk.Flimsy, the card hole ripped when I tried to very gently open it.JUNK!"
2,Cheap & it Feels It.,Still it is just a folder and not a Swiss watch. Just don't take it to an interview. Unless the interview is at K Mart.
4,There's an Owl in the Shower review,"Hi, I am 11 years old and I read the book There's an Owl in the Shower. This book is about a boy named Borden who hates spotted owls because his dad, Leon, lost his job as a logger. Borden found a baby owl, and thinking that the owlet was a barred owl Borden took him home. His dad at first wanted Borden to shot the owlet. But then Leon started to love the owlet. What Borden didn't know was that the owl was a spotted owl. If you read this book you are sure to enjoy it."
5,This is a wonderful book for a geography class,"This delightful story focuses on an environmental issue between the spotted owls and the loggers in the Northwest United States. As a geography teacher I used this story to study that part of the United States. The characters are realistic and my students became very involved along with being able to look at more than one side of an issue. Jean Craighead George took a real problem and placed it in a context that students could understand. The geography is described well along with great descriptions of the characters. This story came highly recommended by the National Council of the Social Studies and is one well worth using in the Social Studies classrom, but the story is so delightful that children enjoy it because of the pacing and the believable characters."
3,There's an owl in the shower,"This was a very interesting book, it was about a boy named Borden who finds a stray owl and takes it home to raise it. As Borden raises the owl, his dad has to get along with it since he's an owl hater and they teach it to fly. I think it is a sad book."
3,I guess it's okay,"I bought this book for my younger sister for christmas who loves animals.I looked at the cover and the picture of the owl was adorible!But later when my sister read the book, she said that Borden's father kept saying that he was going to kill the bird.Well at the end of the book he doesn't kill the bird but just before the end it is really sad what happens to Bardy.To find out what happens, just read the end of the book."
1,There Is An Owl In The Shower,My opinion on this book is this. My opinion on this is that I did not care for this book that much. Because I did not think that the plot or ending was that good. It's because I like books that make you hanging because of the ending. So if you are like me I wouldn't recommand this book!By:Ricky Clark P.S. Have a nice Day!
4,My Favorite Animal!,"I like this book There is an Owl in the Shower. What I liked about your book was that it had something to do with my Mom's favorite animal, an owl. I think this book was really funny, but also it is kind of sad. I liked it because it had an owl in it."
3,Hmm...,"I didn't particularly like The Border. However, the second story was interesting. Debray certainly makes you think. His characters are detached in a way that we all feel at certain times in our life."
4,This CD Rocks!,"I like this CD. The music is lively and fun to listen to outside of the movie context. However, I was disappointed because some of the great musical moments in the movie are not on the CD. The end credits, the popular songs (like ""I can see clearly now."") are not there, and the reference to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" that you can hear during the magnifying glass sequence is not present on the soundtrack."
3,It did not meet all of my criteria.,"It failed to include all of the popular ""ant"" altered songs that I enjoyed so much and laughed so hard about in the movie. Other than that, great music!!!"
2,Disappointing at best,"Ordered 12 & at least 1/2 were already scratched upon arrival, which was really upsetting since shipping them was expensive, & thus not worth the price. Then I had to chop about an 1/8in off each picture just to get it to fit as best as it could. Bought them to display photos in my work office, but if perfect pictures represent professionality, these frames will leave you short. Not worth ordering since you can find slightly better contructed frames of this type in any craft store without getting it shipped."
1,first clue of bad seller,Looking for this frame and of course the first place I look is of course Amazon.found the frame for 10.00 with prime shipping which I am a member. Clicked on it and the price changed. was not longer a prime and wanted 9.50 for shipping and of course no gareentee that you will get it in time unless you wanted to pay another 20.00.After reading the reviews I realize everything happens for a reason so If it had free shipping I probably would have ordered it and gotten a damaged frame.. buyers beware
5,Esy display for Children's Artwork,"This is a great way to display the newest art work that comes home from school. I have one for each child and it is easy to change when a new piece of 'Artwork"" walks in the door. Also great for calendars that you want to look more like a work of art than a just a 'hang up' calendar."
5,Excellent Bonsai,Beautifully pruned tree. Picture does not do the plant justice. Care was taken in shipping the item. Shipping was quick. Instructions are included. I will happily order from Brussel's again.
2,tree-by-mail still ahead of its time ?,"received promptly & very well packed... looked good upon arrival -- albeit younger, smaller, & scawnier than advertised/pictured... but suddenly turned brown and started losing leaves within the first 24 hours... dehydrated or frozen in transit ? soil seemed poor -- maybe too *much* drainage ? seemed hydrophobic and disinclined to wet... also, leaf and bark seemed uncharacteristic for a black olive, but that is probably just my ignorance showing... shipping right to our front door was great, but having to ship it back involved some hassle... Amazon was exceptionally good about processing the return"
1,I'm not sure whats wrong?,"This is a beautiful tree. Perfect limbs, perfect trunk to height ratio, even had 3 bunches of olives on it, they died within a day, still its a very nice tree. Only problem is that it had lost lots of leaves during transit and continues to lose around 20 leaves every day. I have only had it for about a week or so and it will most likely be dead within the next week or so. Its sad, because it was such a nice little tree."
2,not as advertised,"I was so excited to receive my bonsai. it took over 2 weeks to receive, which was very disappointing. When i finally got it, it was packed very well, but that is where the good news ends. my bonsai is about 7-8 inches high, including the pot, not 10-14 as stated in the decription. i was also disappointed with the pot it was grown in, not the beautiful turquoise one in the picture. too expensive for what i received. you need to update the description so people do not think they are getting something they are not.I will not purchase from this seller again.giving this 2 stars is generous. i could have baught this bonsai locally."
2,More Geek than Evil,"Aimed squarely at the computer-guy type it's totally a bore for this car-guy. The actual projects were kind of interesting but too many of them had the same formula:Buy a kit, read instructions and install according to instructions. If you can buy a kit, read instructions and install something, you don't need this book. If you feel that buying a kit, reading instructions, and installing something is hard for you, here is the advice from the book.... Buy a kit, read instructions and install according to instructions.The paper even felt cheap.Also, instead of finding illustrations or pictures of the projects actually built and installed in a car, there were a few totally blank pages. Publishing error? I hope so."
2,Not what I was expecting,The other two star review was the most truthfull about this book. Most of the projects don't give you a step by step for completing the project. Most of the projects just tell you too buy a kit and follow the directions. It gives the electrical skematics but if you have no electrical experience this does you no good. The only thing good it does is give you ideas on what to install on your car.
3,Good book...but not what I was expecting.,"The book does give some really good ideas to what you can do with your car, but it did not go as in depth as I was expecting. I was thinking it would show you how to build all the projects yourself and install them, not tell you to buy a certain product from a company and install it according to the manufacturer's instructions."
5,Outstanding Read - Truely Sensational,"All i can say, is WHOA! This book absouteloutely blew me away, this guy really knows what he's talking about - i couldn't put it down. I read it as soon as I had got it, the projects were very interesting and original, i recommend it highly. and as for the previous comment, the paper DID NOT feel cheap!thanks"
5,SIMPLY GENIUS,I got this book as a christmas present and the first thing i thought was this is exactly what i need. my life long search for a book that covers all of the subjects which i have wanted to know about since the day i was born. i would have been satisfied if this was the only present i got but none compared to this book. i would gladly trade in my ipod for this book if thats what it had to take to get one. This book deserves to be nominated for the times book of the year!! but dont just take my word for it go and buy it now and i promise you wont regret it
4,Darnley,"I bought this book mainly to read the background information about Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox (Darnley's mother). The book held my interest beyond Margaret's story in that it told a familiar tale from an unfamiliar point of view. Any student of Tudor and Stuart history knows the story of Darnley's murder - but usually events unfold from the point of view of Mary, Queen of Scots. Here, events are finally seen from Darnley's perspective. He still comes across as a thoroughly unpleasant fellow, but the reader can, at least, get an inkling of why he was what he was. I orignally considered this a throw away title, but it has earned a place in my Tudor library."
4,Troublesome Darnley,"Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, murdered King of Scotland may have had few qualities that in our modern society would be perceived as admirable. However, he was of great royal birth, intelligent, charming and the victim of his own circumstances. Like his wife, Mary, Queen of Scots, he lived the life he was given to the fullest, making poor and unfortunate choices. He was arrogant and trusting, his two greatest weaknesses. This book gives an excellent background to an often forgotten King."
4,A Nice Latin Change Of Pace,"probably in an effort to differentiate the latin bit from the masses of latin and bossa nova records that were coming out at the time, grant green decidedly shunned most of the more polished latin jazz hits that were being recorded, and focused on some rawer, lesser known tunes. probably the most well known tune on the release is ""mambo inn"", made famous by george shearing quintet a few years earlier. while johnny acea's piano playing is similar to shearing's, green's excellent, and long, guitar solo gives the track its own uniqueness. also included is a samba version of charlie parker's, ""my little suede shoes"". again, green takes control of the song, with a few excellent and creative solos. but, while green's nimble and relaxed guitar playing give the lp a spark, it's the backing band that keeps it fresh. willie bobo keeps everything steady on the drums, while potato valdez on the congas and carvin masseaux on the chekere make the music sound less americanized."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was so excited when I saw this item and I placed it on my wish list for Christmas. My husband purchased it for me and when I took it out to assemble it the paint was all peeling off and the holes do not match up when putting it together. I will be returning if it isn't too much of a hassle. It's a shame becuase it's a great concept but very poorly designed. Sadly, I would not recommend it."
1,Dont buy!,"Do not waste your money! I was so excited to use this in my classroom but it is horrible. It came with faulty pieces and it said new and it was not. To prove that it wasnt new the zip ties were already cut. My boyfriend had to drill in holes to the faulty piece. The screws were stripped also and the file folders were crappy. You can not find them anywhere to buy more and they are an odd size. Worst product ever, I got ripped off!!"
5,"Emaue, Aun Asi","This band is great. The album has an array of different genres which gives the band a unique flavor. The whole album has a groove. This is one of those albums you leave in your cd player for days and you dont get tired of listening to it. I highly recomend this album to those interested in expanding their rock en espanol, latin rock archive. Good music, great band, good cd."
4,Great Music,"This cd and along with the band are super unique.It has a great sound, I cant Stop listening to it or dancing to it! its adicting! You Got to own it..."
5,The Perfect Solution,My son has several autographed baseball hats that I wanted to display for him but didn't want dust all over them. These display holders look so nice and make just the perfect cover for the hats. You can still clearly see the autographs. We are very pleased and highly recommend these!
3,Bulky has hole at bottom,"Flimsy bottom, piece of thin very thin plastic with a hole at the bottom. I suppose the hole serves the purpose of popping out the bottom. Very bulky display cover. Works though, nothing fancy or anything. I just got it to protect some championship hats that are white from the dust. Works great for that, but if you wanted to display something really nice then you may not want this it all depends. For the price it's better than I thought it was going to be. Very thick and durable plastic, but still bulky as in any case or cover. So, totally up to what you want."
4,Hat display,"Not what I expected from the product, it's comes in two parts, the top is transparent and durable, used to protect and display the cap, but the bottom is a thin material that does not fit good in the top, also brings a small hole that allows the dust."
2,Not as described,It doesn't fit a typical baseball hat. Seems like it is made for a baseball helmet because the hate will bend out of shape if you try to squeeze it in there. Just shipped it back for return.
4,Fits my needs perfectly,"I am a merchandiser for a greeting card company. I use a utility knife to open boxes of new product to put out and I carry it in my apron. All the others I tried were so heavy. This one is nice and light and it is still a utility knife, not one of the snap aways.I could not find one anywhere in our area. I looked at 7 or 8 big box stores and they did not carry this. It was worth it to me to pay the shipping to have a nice light knife."
5,These guys used to attack the audience with raw meat!,"I saw this band two or three times, and I owned this Album (the LP version). They are very funny, and they rock! If you like this Search out and find The Cherry Bomb Club. It was founded by one of the X-Pinchers. It's a different style of music. Kinda like when Weller left the Jam and formed Style Council."
4,Good old school!!,"I used to listen to this when I was a lot younger and I love it more and more every time I listen to it. Morrisey Rides a Cockhorse is the best song. I has it's dirty points, but if you like good music, it doesn't matter."
2,Repetitively boring,"I bought this book because I already knew what Jose had to say, but wanted to hear what Jessica had say. The 1st half of the book she said absolutely nothing except repeat how she would catch Jose cheating, they would fight, break up, and get back together again. In fact she just repeats this throughout the whole book. How many times can you read the same story before you get bored?? You really get to the point where you just want to slap her and knock some sense into her for being so stupid.I really dont know why I kept reading this book. I kept hoping something eventfull would happen, but it never really did. I wouldnt recommend this book unless you want to hear an ex-wifes story about how her husband cheats on her and abuses her in a never ending cycle of 230+ pages"
1,Shameless Self-Promotion,"First of all, I think this book can be read in one hour because it's about on a fourth grade reading level. I think Jessica was trying to get readers to feel sorry for her..FOR WHAT?? Being a gold digger?? She is more stuck on herself than Jose is. Many references to the way she feels she is ""hot"" and Sexy. She admits that even as a teenager she was only attracted to guys who were ""buff"" and gorgeous. Well, DUH!! What did we expect her to say' ""I really wanted to marry a guy who is 130lbs soaking wet in his clothes, has tape on his horn-rimmed glasses, and wears a pocket protector."" Please give me a break! And to think this woman is a mother?? Of course some famous guy is going to take you to bed if you throw yourself at them enough. I'm sorry but the whole time I was reading I was on Jose's side completely. Glad he came to his senses and let her go!!"
1,"Oh, please","You can put your clothes back on now, Jessica. Also, just wondering why you didn't retain your maiden name. Maybe you wouldn't have sold any books?"
1,how spouses of celebrities get even,"After the media coverage of Jose Canseco's whistle blowing on steroid users, I had to read his wife's tell all. Of course I wouldn't pay for it; it took me about an hour to read it in the bookstore. Jessica reveals herself to be the female version of her celebrity husband: egocentric, two-dimensional, silly cheerleader type who has nothing to offer but what's only on the outside. She has a penchant for using the ""F"" word and talks about their screaming sessions which I'm sure often took place in front of their daughter. What a good mom, what a good dad. This book should cause her nothing but shame and embarrassment, but laughably she says she is mentally well. Mentally well people don't live the shallow, meaningless life she did and then brag about most of it. What a dope."
3,Media Class,"I am writing this review for my media class at Oklahoma State University. I read Juicy when I was still in high school and I loved it. I think this book really makes you think. For my friends and I growing up our dream was to date all the good looking athletes. I think this book shows that its not always the best think dating a rich powerful athlete. But overall, I thought this book was very interesting and a good read!"
1,canseco's world,"The book is easy to read but if I had the oportunity to live her life I would not spend my time degrading myself like she is doing in this book. Specially when you are involved with a celebrity that is orfan of a mother, she needs to replace the sexual love that she gives into a little bit of maternal love and sexual love. When I read the book i felt very sorry for her way of expressing herself. In 1994 I met her in person in her house and she look fantastic but it seems that jose is those types of men that destroyes the fisical and external beauty of any woman because probably he wants more and more of.....in a sexual relation. Today is 8/3/2009 and Jessica is marry to a profesional and I hope it works for her because every one deserve a good life in this small world, Thanks and God bless you all the fans."
1,WHAT A BORE,"I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE PUBLISHER ALLOWED THIS PIECE OF S___ TO BE PRINTED. BOTH THE CANSECO'S ARE EGO TRIPS AND SHALLOW AS A TEASPOON OF WATER. ALL THIS WOMAN DOES IS TELL US TO FEEL SORRY FOR HER. HER MARRIAGE TO ARROGANT JOSE CONSISTS OF FIGHTING, CHEATING BY JOSE, SHOPPING AND SPENDING LOADS OF MONEY ON CARS AND EXOTIC ANIMALS. SHE CRYS ON THE PHONE TO HER MOTHER, GIVES US SOME DIRT ABOUT HER LIFE IN THE BEDROOM AND THE STEROIDS USAGE OF HUMBLE JOSE. THIS BOOK IS SO BORING AND REPETITIVE IT SHOULD BE USED AS A DOOR STOP OR USED AS A SEDATIVE. POOR JESSICA IS TRYING TO BE SUCH A GOOD MOTHER THAT SHE POSED NUDE. WHAT A GREAT EXAMPLE THIS STUPID B___ IS FOR HER DAUGHTER. JOSE AND JESSICA DESERVE EACH OTHER. THIS WOMAN SHOULD BE B____ SLAPPED."
4,Good for twelve bucks,"First of all let me tell you that this trimmer is tiny at only 5 inches long. If you plan to shave large areas find something bigger or just use regular hair clippers.Overall I like this product, and think it does a decent good job. The blades cut well, but don't bite into your skin and the adjustements work fine. The adjustment wheel is a little hard to turn, but not a big deal. The shaver didn't work for me, but then again no electric shaver ever has. The fact that you can take it in the shower is a plus and it comes with a nice brush and decent sized oil bottle.For twelve bucks it's great - if the price were higher though I'd look for something else."
2,Okay as a clipper - horrible for a clean shave - doesn't work wet,"This product works okay as a dry clipper for those places where you just want to trim. However, it doesn't work wet as advertised - the hair gets matted and the combs don't catch it. For anywhere you want a clean shave (chest, back, etc), the foil doesn't work AT ALL, wet or dry. It doesn't remove any hair the length that the shortest comb leaves. Also, the pop-up trimmer (which I used for my neckline and sideburns) gets rid of hair, but it irritates, and can even draw blood. Overall, a pretty junky product."
1,Significant loss of blood...,"I've used a Philips Bodygroom for years without any problem, but I wanted give something else a try. I won't go into detail, but even used very carefully, this thing caused numerous cuts and significant loss of blood in an area that a man really does not want to see any blood. On other parts of the body it's just OK. I will be going back to the Bodygroom, and throwing this thing in the trash."
3,good but be careful,i like the itemfirst off i bought it to shave excess body hairit works great - but it is a bit sharp - so u need to be careful with it as u can cut yourselfclearly a HQ item at a very reasonable pricebe careful when you're using it
2,Not as advertised,"This is one of the worst products I've purchased in memory. As one of the other reviewers said it does not work at all if the objective is to get a clean shave, as opposed to buying this as a trimmer. If you want the trimmer option as your main feature then this will do you fine.The shaver does not work unless you run it over that ""body zone"" an unbelievable amount of times."
1,Bad trimmer,This body hair trimmer is really bad quality.The hair starts flying around after they're cut making a huge mess.The dial has only 5 settings.My previous trimmer from Panasonics was much better.
4,"Great Body Hair Trimmer, not the best Face Shaver....","For trimming Body Hair the Remington BHT-2000 does a fine job, but using the Shaver head to Shave one's Face is another story, since the head is quite small, shaving takes a long time and it is easy to ""miss a spot'. Even with that drawback I am very happy with my purchase as it is a great value, and compact enough for travel."
3,Decent Champions Resource,"This supplement has a lot of interesting information and some decent characters; the bits about British culture are particularly useful. There are some downsides, however. First, the writers apparently based this on a magic-free (or magic-lite)campaign, and explain away all of the King Arthur mythos with high-tech, alien technology. This meshes poorly with other supplements and most superhero campaigns; it's a fine decision for a single campaign, but it limits this supplement's usefulness. Second, in an attempt to save space, the authors used condensed stat blocks for many of the characters. It takes a lot of work just to get a character sheet for one of them to introduce in an adventure. The book could have used less emphasis on the cultural information and more space to detail these characters. Still, it's an enjoyable read."
3,Fair value for price,"I really liked this book, the source material was good, the art was not so good, however, and aside from a truly stunning cover, I was really let down here. However, I found the characters on the whole to be well thought out, and not too ""hackneyed""."
5,The Queen of Bel Canto,"Lucia Aliberti is recognized as ""The Queen of BelCanto"" in Italy and Germany. She is sought afterfor operas and recitals in those countries and alsoin Japan.Unfortuately, for reasons I cannot understand,Aliberti's art is neglected in North America.You may not get the opportunity to hear Mme.Aliberti in person. Instead, you may have tobe content with this wonderful CD. [In fact,Mme. Aliberti has completed two new CD's--Viva!Belcanto (BMG/RCA 74321 74380 2) and A Portrait(BMG/RCA 74321 57436 2Mme. Aliberti's total mastery of the Bel Cantorepetory, her incredible vocal technique,and hersoaring upper register are unmatched in today'sopera world.Mme. is not a generalist. She is a Bel Cantosoprano. Her instrument is made for thismusic, and it would appear that this music wasmeant for her instrument.Buy this CD! (Then track down the two new ones.)Arnold H. Matlin, M.D."
3,Cools our bedroom. Found a solution for the leaking.,"Our bedroom is roughly 14x16 ft with an 8 ft ceiling. This thing cools that space nicely at night. Yes, it's noisy, but we've learned to live with the sound of it kicking on and off. We have it venting in a heating vent in our floor. It leaked all over the floor a couple times which prompted me to hit the local Home Depot for one of those trays you put under a hot water heater. Works great. Got a PVC pipe fitting to plug the drain hole in the tray and that was that. So Cal is pretty dry, so I don't have the humidity-related issues some people are describing.Recently the fan inside has started making a terrible chirping sound after a few minutes of turning the AC on. I took the back panel off and cleaned the build up of dust and fuzz on the radiator fins but it doesn't look like I'm capable of going in any further. Perhaps this falls under routine AC maintenance after a couple seasons of use. To the local repair center for a check up, I guess."
1,bad quality or packing,Item was broken when delivered so we did not have a chance to test it out. we returned it and got another AC
2,"Weak, noisy, and poorly designed - Do Not Buy","The unit is weaker than a regular fan in terms of cold air output. It's a joke. I gave it two stars for the free shipping and price before I tested it and compared to other units that my friends have. It really should be zero-star.The vent flap is of a flawed design, so semi-cool air you get drops right down to the ground regardless of flap position.The temp sensor was defective on my unit, automatically dropping as the unit ran, even as the actual room temp stayed the same. It was quite comical to have the unit tell me the room was 70 degrees when it was 92.The unit is noisier (air speed noise) than I would expect though to be fair it probably is as loud as the specs indicate.It did leak on me once, but only a tiny bit. Clearly it overflows before shutting off. I probably would have had more leaks if it had been working right and actually producing cold air (and therefore condensation).Do not buy this unit. Read the reviews and go elsewhere."
1,Horrible - not self evaporating,"I've had mine for a couple of years and use it in my bedroom. It fills with water ever 2 hours when it's really hot, and the plug is at the bottom of the tank. It's messy and difficult to drain, and of course, when you're sleeping, its like taking care of a toddler - getting up every 1.5 to 2 hours to drain the water out. I completely regret this purchase and would never ever ever buy this again. Completely pointless."
5,"Great scholarship, illuminating narrative","This book is a must read. It's well-written, deeply researched, short and eye-opening. Balmer shows how Dutch Reformed religion faced pressure from within and without that led to assimilation to English culture, which meant a turn to revivalist evangelicalism or the Church of England. How this developed, from the 1660s to the 1780s, is what Balmer tells in this book. It deserves a place on the shelf of everyone interested in religion in America and who is concerned about retaining a confessional tradition. One may find Darryl Hart's The Lost Soul a good way to follow A Perfect Babel."
4,Best Item packed in a smaller size,I purchased this product last month and it sure lived up to its hype. I use to see alot of dust flying around in my house. I'm glad to say now its disappeared. My house is more fresher and more alive now more than ever Thanks to the Ionic Pro Therapure 100 now i just keep it near my computer.
3,Less efficiency,The product is too small to purify air for a small size room. So we had to buy a HEPA air purifier.
2,no ionic technology,"For filtering, it only has a little foam filter. Luckily my problem was mainly one of mold, so it mostly does the trick. The product description and name are quite misleading."
5,Most of you missed the point,"It must be discouraging to Mamet to have so many completely miss the point of this movie. This movie is not about ""right"" or ""justice"" or ""honor"" or ""perseverance"" or any of the stuff mentioned by many other reviewers (at least the several that I read). It is about epigamic differentiation, a biological phenomenon known to most of you as ""love at first sight"". It is a romance, completely and entirely, between Pidgeon's character (Catherine) and Northam's (Sir Robert). It is all there, but disguised by the apparent story about a boy falsely accused of cheating at school, or whatever. Sir Robert falls in love with Catherine on first seeing her in his office and all his actions from then on are driven by it. She does not catch on until the last scene. It is delicious."
4,Great film; terrible DVD transfer,"It appears that the other reviewers have neglected to remark on the video transfer quality of this wonderful film. It is, in a word, dreadful. Anyone watching this DVD on a widescreen monitor--even a computer monitor--will notice that it appears to have been transferred from an out-of-focus, low quality original print. Such a pity! The subtle visual nuances of the original film are obscured; the gross imperfections are very distracting."
4,Fascinating snapshot of an English family and their politics,"Sometimes the silences in movies are as important as the dialogue. Mamet uses both brilliantly and deliberately in this intriguing film.Jeremy Northam finally gets to use his intelligence and acting skill in this film, so for all you Northam fans this movie is a must-see. The rest of the actors are fine as well, especially Mamet's wife Rebecca Pidgeon. I haven't liked many of her previous roles in his films, but she is well-matched to Northam and really shines here.The music, cinematography, and set design are all excellent."
5,A perfect film !,"The honor in the actual times seems to have become a devaluated coin . Words such as Aristos , friendship , honor , have taken a slow boat to China .Nevertheless there are people in the world who still are guided for an ethics inscribed in the cosmos ; souls who never crossed the Lethes (The forgetful river according to Plato) .The astonishing mind of this notable screen player and director David Mamet shone with eloquent brightness in this European stylized movie about a debt of honor for a family .The dramatis personae will seduce you from beginning to end .Tastefully artistic direction and very well written script make of this film one of the hidden treasures of this year."
5,Best Film of 1999!,"Quite simply, this is an overlooked masterpiece. A highly literate movie that really speaks to ""family values."" Brilliant dialogue (what else would you expect from David Mamet), superior acting and one of the most affecting (and understated) love stories of recent years. The ending is priceless. Although rated ""G"" it really isn't a movie for children since it so understated (and admittedly wordy, but in the very best sense).As an aside, this is a remake of a film made in 1948 starring Robert Donat as Sir Robert, a young Margaret Leighton as the sister and Cedric Hardwicke as the father. The original film is equally brilliant, with great acting particularly by Donat, but the plot is somewhat more filled out. If you loved the Mamat version you need to see the original as well. Alas, it is only available in VHS and is somewhat difficult to find!"
3,visual quality not enhanced by DVD format: I am chocked.,"I saw this movie 6 months ago in a theater and was awed by its quality: not just the unfolding of the story, the crisp dialog, the restrain and efficiency of means, but also the great visual beauty of it, sharpness of details, etc. This DVD, though, looks like a cheap VHS tape visually: what happened? I am awfully disappointed. Somebody, tell me who bungled this gorgeous movie's DVD transfer?"
4,The Winslow Boy,"I am a big indie movie fan....Great stories without the big Hollywood spin. I loved The Winslow Boy the first time I saw it, but I could never find it for sale in the stores. If you enjoy period pieces, great acting and a somewhat sentimental story, you will love The Winslow Boy!"
4,"A Little Of This, A Little Of That","This is an interesting book for a person to learn a little bit about everything connected with pro cyclists, the Tour de France and particularly Lance Armstrong. Regarding the latter, I expected a biased account but the author was good at just giving us information and having us make up our own mind about the famous athlete. However one feels about Lance, this book gives us a good insight on what it's like to be him. It's pretty amazing.Interesting insights on other riders, the crowds, directors, doctors, bike and fitness maintenance, Sheryl Crow.....it's all here, and with a touch of humor here and there, too. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is some agenda items author Daniel Coyle needlessly injects in the story on occasion (i.e. like Armstrong, he has little use for religion but why would I care what the author thinks on the topic?)Still, this is a good read whatever your knowledge of cycling."
5,"Loed it, couldn't put it down.",I wish i had gotten around to reading this earlier. Easily one of the best if not the best books i have ever read on cycling and that covers a lot of ground. once you start you can't stop reading it until you are done. I'm hoping to see more books by Daniel Coyle.
4,"Not All About Lance, Good Insight into Pro Racing","I just got into cycling last year. I learned a lot about the pro racing scene from this book. There are a lot of details you wouldn't expect, and it both humanized and glorified Lance. While it seemed factual and unbiased, it did seem a little vague about Lance's tainted blood tests. Obviously there is no hard proof or he would have been found guilty.Anyhow regardless of whether or not he did dope, which everyone seems to think all pro cyclists do or did, he still had to ride hard and ran a tight ship w/ the team. The organization necessary to run a team is amazing and outlined in this book. It is easy to read and entertaining."
2,Success and testosterone,"I don't know the specifics of Lance Armstrong's cancer. However, I assume that he became hypogonadal after treatment for his testicular cancer and is taking testosterone, which is an anabolic steroid. The average young male has a serum testosterone concentration between 300 and 1200 ng/dl. Most average around 500. If Armstrong were to take enough testosterone to keep his testosterone level at the upper end of the normal range he would, potentially, have a physical advantage over his competitors. He would also test negative for synthetic steroids. It would be interesting to know what his serum testosterone is."
1,"Lance Armstrong's War:One Man's Battle Against Fate, Fame, Love, Death, Schandal, and a Few Other Rivals on the Road to the Tour",I believe the book is insinuating that all Tour de France members use drugs.including Lance Armstrong. His book is fat in size but needs more conclusive evidence before hinting that Lance is using drugs. Lance Armstrong is so pissed at the French for the drug allegations that he wants to race the Tour de France an eighth time. Shame on the author for not giving Lance more credit. Further shame on him for not making Lance Armstrong the great American hero. I do not recommend this book to anyone. I'm sorry I bought it. --Tania Cole
1,Arrogant Armstong,"I have a hard time reading anything about Lance Armstong being a hero. No real man, let alone a 'hero', leaves his wife and 3 young children to pursue a life more in line with superstardom. Here is a man who when he is not on his bike is up-and-about with Sheryl Crow... You have to ask yourself, when is he fathering his children? Some battle!"
4,Another victory on Planet Lance,"An excellent book written from a refreshing perspective, that being one other then Lance himself. In reading what he goes through to achieve his goals from an outsider's point of view, makes his story that much more incredible. It also allows the reader to get an idea of what is happening all around Planet Lance, which is what sets it apart from the previous autobiographical books."
4,Lance Armstrong's war.....,Interesting in depth account on the trials and tribulations of a cycling star.
3,review,"Not an in-depth review of lances life, but a really good look into the world of cycling and the teams competing on the tour. Really fascinating to find the ins and outs of how the cycling world works and the mentality of armstrong and his team which has seen him reach the top."
3,A Notable Effort,"The first thing you think of is, ""Oh great, another book about Lance Armstrong."" But you buy it anyway, since, at the time we were still riding the long coattails of Lancemania.I agree with another reviewer who said that he kept waiting for something concrete about the famous rider, but, I think, Coyle actually met Armstrong only once, and then only briefly.It is a good book in many respects, talking about cycling, cyclists, and the psychology of racing -- but there's little if anything about the Texan that we haven't heard before. Maybe it should have been called The Pro Cycling War."
5,Very funny and affectionate look at pro cycling,"Mr. Coyle has given us and his subjects (including the elusive Mr. Armstrong) a great gift. His funny, beautiful prose was in perfect juxaposition with the essence of the sport he covered with much affection. Do sane people ride nearly naked (Lycra!) at 60 mph down twisting, narrow mountain roads (in the rain!)? We can only look on in wonder at their courageous, graceful, crazy, difficult, ""cut of coffee short"" careers. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading."
5,A Different Side of the Story?,"I was expecting this to be another story TOLD by Lance, but it was not. I found this to be a more refreshing view on Lance and the Doping Scandles that encircled his Tour De France days.No matter what my opinion is on Lance and the doping, I found this to be a great read. I learned about some of the ""players"" in the Cycling media community that are attacking lance's position and character (justified or not), and how the Team operates around the Cycling legend."
5,Fantastic book,Well written and engaging. Good info on the world of cycling. You do not need to be a hard core cyclist to enjoy this book.
4,Easy Read,"I read this book while on vacation. I found it easy to read, flowed nicely between chapters and helped give the reader insight to the inner workings of Lance and professional cycling."
2,Pages out of order,"I was disappointed in the product because the pages were out of order. I don't have the book with me now, but it started around page 30 and went thru page 50, then began page 1."
2,Where is Lance? Where is War?,"This is not a terrible book per se. I enjoyed author's clinical and humorous take on Planet Lance, and professional cycling by and large. The bit on Dr. Ferrari testing LA for power/weigh ratio is particularly tasty.Why then only 2 stars? It is because of its misleading title.With a title like ""Lance Armstrong's War..."" one would expect juicy insider details on LA's training leading upto his 6th Tour title, and battling media on a host of hot button issues such as doping allegations, divorce, high profile law suits and etc. Instead, half of the book focuses on TdF's top contenders--Vino, Tyler, Ullrich and Mayo. I welcome these chapters, although they do not serve the main theme of the book. The other half feels like a collection of newspaper and web articles.The author/publisher must have put ""War"" in the title because it helps sell the book. This is disgraceful sloppy journalism. Fellow readers/cycling fans, don't be fooled !"
5,Track listing,1.Sleepwalk2.Batstein3.Daylight Fades4.Wonderful World5.Falling Away6.The Beginning & End7.In Isolation8.More Than Meets the Eye9.No Sacrifice10.Holding Your Breath
4,Premier Agnelli & Nelson,"If you're the beginning trance listener like me, you may have bought the classic Tranceport I, mixed by the legendary Paul Oakenfold. And like me, you may have listened to the classic Agnelli & Nelson track on the album ""El Nino"" and thought, ""how boring."" (Or not.) But anyways, Hudson Street is an awesome track. The New York Mix, especially, has a huge, anthemic build up. If you want more of this stuff, check out A&N's other import single, ""Embrace"", which actually has mixes of two excellent singles, ""Embrace"" and ""Everyday."" Superb stuff...4 stars"
5,"not quite Harmony Row, but pretty fine","I still don't quite ""get"" the opening song, which is complicated and instrumentally too busy. But the other seven songs were up to Jack's standard. More personal lyrics, too, about time, separation, and the perils of showbiz life. And Jack Bruce was still at his singing peak on this release. The Andy Johns production hasn't dated all that well.This was the record that convinced Mick Taylor to quit the Rolling Stones for a job in Jack's band. Sadly they didn't keep up for long. Still making up my mind about the sound versus the no longer available 1988 transfer (does it really matter?). Of the bonus tracks, only one seemed really interesting: Keep on Wondering, which made me think of Stevie Wonder, who was influencing a lot of musicians in 1974. Ironically I hear Wonder even though Jack dropped his harmonica solo for some nice guitar from session mate Steve Hunter (who Jack must have met while making Lou Reed's Berlin)."
4,Almost ... ALMOST perfect,"I grew up with this music , fantastic to finally have it on cd. It would have been perfect if it weren't for 2 songs on disc 2 that have been remade without the Eve Graham / Lyn Paul mixture.No need to identify them cause if you don't know after listening to them , then maybe it won't matter to you . Please please please release all (Original) New Seekers albums on cd. They were the vocal group of the seventies , none better ..Accept no other combination . Peter ,Paul, Marty, Eve, and Lyn ."
5,Excellent collection of The New Seekers songs,This album had all of the New Seekers best music from thier classic albums. I really enjoyed listening to all their songs again. I would highly recommend this collection if you like the New Seekers.
3,The Cult Classic Movie with a Cult Classic Soundtrack,"The Cult film of 1986 came to cinemas, crawled about a bit and then skulked off to video, where it revived itself and attained its status. The soundtrack has been doing much the same thing. Mark Isham's haunting themes have been a draw to me for a long time. His main theme is unsettling and atmospheric, which strikes a pattern for the soundtrack as a whole. At times the faster paced tracks reek of the 1980's synthesizer soundtrack - a little uneven, and of course wholely accompanying the action on screen. By themselves the tracks sometimes grate a little, leaving this soundtrack with a lower overall rating. However, in the looming, haunting singular tracks there is a stroke of genius which cannot help to impress and you may find echoed today by the likes of Hans Zimmer, Brian Eno and Yani. For these tracks, the sountrack lives and is remembered. If you like these modern composers then you are sure to enjoy the unsung talents of Mark Isham."
1,Cintre SATA,"The seller is outstanding in service, delivery and technical assistance. However neither the original item that was shipped or the replacement unit functioned. I own three other Cintre eide hard drive enclosures that work well. The SATA units apparently have a problem."
5,Takfarinas has a new fan!,"I rarely find a CD that I enjoy listening to in entirety, and this is one of them! I went looking for some Arabic music for the first time and I'm very happy I chose this one because now I'm ready for more! The enjoyment is so multi-layered: the music, the melodies, the voice, the lyrics. Every track is memorable even without my understanding the language. The variety of rhythms and moods range from ecstatic to mourning, from patriotic to dance. Traditional yet very contemporary at the same time.My only regret is that I have to tediously translate the French translation to understand even the gist of the lyrics. Even in this, however, there are intriguing surprises. My favorite track, ""Lounes"", turned out to be a tribute to Mahoub Lounes, a singer who was recently assassinated. The already moving tune became even MORE so, understanding the actual lyrics! What a pity they didn't include an English translation so more of us can learn the sentiments of the talented Takfarinas!"
2,Hmm,Well..its cinnamon. Thats really all. I dont know howthey are considered stix cause its more like a flat pieceof bark. I cant use it for what i needed to.
3,Small,"These sticks are pretty small. Maybe a couple inches long, thin and you'll get about 15 of them per package."
1,Showing its age,Perhaps the best that can be expected of a program that has been around as the Tomb Raider series. Doesn't lend itself to Nintendo as much as many other games.
3,"Fun, but too simple at times!","I'm a die hard Tomb Raider fan, and have been buying the games since they came out, so I was very thrilled to find out that they were going to release a TR game on DS, which meant that I could now take it on the go, and play it anywhere I go.And while this game has got the basics, it is too easy. Unlike the normal PC version, you are given no choice of what to do. Basically, there is only one road to go, and the controls are so limiting that even if you want to go the other way, and see if that way is the way to go, you won't be able to do so as you'll be blocked by an invisible wall.The controls are good, though. You will be able to play in no time. Overall, if you are a TR fan, and you don't mind that it is a bit too easy, you will enjoy this game."
2,frustrating,"I got this game because I used to play tomb raider for the PC. Tomb Raider for DS is totally different. For one thing when you need to shoot someone your guns don't automatically lock on the target. You have to use your touch screen to guide where you shoot. Its not that bad but I would prefer it to be automatic. Also, there is no look feature for this game. There is one part in the 1st level where you have to jump onto a ledge but the ledge isn't really in the screen so you don't know where your jumping to. I had to go through it 20 times just to get the jump right because I couldn't see what the hell I was jumping onto. I haven't played this game very much because I get more frustration than enjoyment out of it."
4,Classic game; linear platformer on DS,"Happy to have this classic game on my DS. Disappointed that you cannot have a training session in the mansion, as on other versions of the game (on other consols).But a good introduction to the Tomb Raider series, and it will re-awaken interest in the others of the series that I have."
3,It's A Legend,I like this game. Tomb Raider has always been a legend. I finished the whole game and wish there was more. Nintendo DS should use better graphics in this game to make it more realistic though like the Playstation.
3,Not what I expected...,"Mister Tolkien is one of my favorite authors, and I love all of his works. I enjoyed this book because it contains all of the poems and some original artwork of Tolkien's, but I was slightly disappointed by the size. I was surprised at just how 'pocket size' it really was - almost a miniature book, you could say. It is a cute and witty addition to any Tolkien collection, but, like I said, not what I expected."
3,It's tiny,"I bought it as a gift. I really like it, but it is rather small. I thought it would be a little bigger."
2,"The Book is a ""POCKET BOOK""","Need a magnifying glass to read. The book measurements are 3""x3.5"" (inches)If the book had been a normal sized book, I would have given it positive review."
2,"Good or Bad, Depending on its intended use","The title pretty much sums it up. I bought the pen because I was tired of spending hours each week typing up my notes (that I took in class). The problem with the pen (why I returned it) is that the handwriting recognition is a DISASTER. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I have the best handwriting in the world, but it takes some serious coding errors to interpret ""this is a test"" as ""~de93, h;02"". If you are someone in my position, I would recommend that you snub the IO2 for now and try out some digital scanners (btw, they are much cheaper)."
4,Logitech IO2 Review,"The pen is easy to set up and use. It has a nice feel in your hand. Software is an easy install. The handwriting conversion could be better, and the training takes quite some time to finish. I'm not sure if the device ""learns"" as it continues, but that would be nice.It does work and you do at least get a nice image of your notes. My only complaint is that it is tightly integrated to Microsoft Office documents; ok, it does Word, Outlook, Onenote, etc. But it would be nice if you could get a generic data output (even, say, a text file) so that you could convert your handwriting over to other applications.The hardware appears to be rock solid. The cradle works well, and the pen writes well as just an ink pen. Overall, it isn't a product that will work well for everyone; but if you take a lot of notes, and you have nice printing, this might be for you."
5,"Excellent Design, Great Features, Fun & Practical","The pen is stylish and ergonomic. It is a little bigger than a regular pen but not too big to carry in a shirt pocket. Fits in the hand nicely with a good ergonomic feel. The cradle folds cleverly into a small, compact form and plugs in via USB. Installation on Windows XP was a little problematic. Although it doesn't say that it requires a reboot, it actually took several before the installation completed successfully. Some work is definitely needed to make the install more friendly. The software itself, however is very user friendly. The handwriting recognition works very well without any training.Overall the product is feature rich and represents a new way to capture your thoughts electronically. If you like to write and keep a notebook close by all the time then you will really like this product. The benefit of taking only a notebook with you and not having to take a notebook computer with you all the time is worth it."
2,"OK for XP, no good for Vista","This digital pen worked pretty good while using Microsoft Windows XP. After changing to a Windows Vista computer it hasn't worked at all.If you are using the Vista OS, stay away from this until they have provided a program that will work with your OS."
4,Memory Small,"This is a great product for those who probably don't write too much. As an engineering student, I found the incapability of this product to interpret greek letters and equations quite understandable - however, it maxed out at 6 pages and that is just too little for even an hour or note taking in a tough class. Plus, It would be nice to be able to turn off the pen occasionally."
4,"a new way to capture meeting notes, etc.","this review is probably a bit premature. have only used it for 6 or 8 sheets of paper. it's not perfect, but then neither is my printing. all things considered, i like it and recommend it. faithfully captures all that is written on digital paper (required), looks like a scanned image. with simple encode, will convert image to text into a ms one note or ms word doc. fair to good. other conversions are available, limited recognition of indented outlining. the pen itself is a bit fat, but easily used. you will have to decide which digital paper to buy. at this time, the A5 tablets seem best buy. with a paper cutter and punch, pages fit nicely in a half size (5"" x 8"")'day timer' type loose leaf binder. the 8.5"" x 11"" digital book style item is supremely over priced. finally, this IO2 from all i can find out is a leap over IO1. when is IO3? unless you know, i say get IO2."
1,NO LONGER SUPPORTED,Just opened as a Christmas present and went to Logitech website for some info - NO LONGER BEING SUPPORTED !! Paper only available UNTIL SUPPLY RUNS OUT!!
4,Nu-metal thats actually good?,"Cold falls under the same category as Limp Bizkit, Staind, andall the other nu-metal stuff, but there is one difference. Every song flows with melodic intensity (especially Just Got Wicked), and once you listen to it for the first time, you'll love it."
4,I like this album.,"I have both COLD albums and I think this one is the better of the two. If you like ""Just Got Wicked"" then get the album. There are other good songs on it too."
4,Colds Best so FAR!!!,"This is a pretty good cd and i didnt even hear the whole cd yet the songs i heard were just got wicked, she said, end of the world, send in the clowns and its all good and just those songs were wicked cool. This band kinda sounds like staind and creed put together with their own sound but i have to admit i have the first cold cd but this one is way better buy this cd and you will not be disappointed.thanx---MaTT"
4,extremely cold,"I am not a big metal fan, and usually prefer down to earth rock, but I make an exception for this excellent album. Cold manage to overcome a problem many metal groups have, which is unoriginal chords and manuevers, and manage to have powerful instrumental accompaniment that doesn't get in the way of the powerful vocal abilities that Cold displays here. And anyway, it's not ""pure"" metal.... loved it."
5,The best CD i have ever bought,I have been a music fan for a long time. I have purchased many excellent albums over those years. Little did I know that the best CD ever made was by a band so few have heard about. I am very picky about my CD's and I can say for sure this is the best CD I have ever bought. Scooter Ward has the best voice I have ever heard. The only person that can rival him is Aaron Lewis from Staind and even he can't come close.
4,"Finally, a new band that doesn't need to scream","Believe it or not, it is a band that doesn't have a persistent scream fronting the band. Instead, this band comes up with beautiful melodies from the front man, Scooter, and incorporates electronics and electronic guitars in too. Cold, is also a great band to see live, as I did with Marilyn Manson, and Godhead. This cd is very good, too bad it was produced by the moron Fred Durst. I like the singer's voice, although it sounds a lot like Gavin Rossdale from Bush. The first song, ""Just Got Wicked"" is my favorite on the album, and really shows that this is a talented band, and the interlude is heavy enough for all you nu-metal freaks. Those looking for a slipknot/screaming band, won't find it here, since these guys actually use in-depth melodies in their songs. Great cd; the only thing is that many songs sound a lot alike. oh well."
4,"love it, but....","Alright, basically the whole album is basically kick .... However, i didn't like how the singer sings about rape in almost every other song. If there is a good reason for it, i don't know...but i still don't like it all the rape stuff. favorite songs are no one, witch, send in the clowns, and bleed (which is a must listen, very melodic, makes me cry!!!) hopefully, you will enjoy this album as much as i do!"
3,"Chilling, but somewhat amateur-ish","This is a relatively ok cd, by a band that really hasn't yet grown up musically. Tracks 3 and 4 are worth the price of the album alone... _this_ is what you hoped the 2nd Creed cd would sound like.Otherwise, the disc is a patchwork of sound, and often not a very interesting one. Sometimes they diverge into an Alice in Chains sound, just because they can (which is the motive of all AIC sound-alikes). Most irritating is the senseless insertions of swear words and copycat phrases by the band's vocalist... you would swear that Scooter Ward is using this album simply to set up five or six moments on stage where he gets to mimic his favorites: Korn, Pantera, Metallica, etc.No doubt this band has one good cd in them, but we haven't seen it yet."
4,"No rain songs, but great music","I love this band, they do great dark, depressing music, perfect for a rainy day, but there's no actual songs about the rain! I love songs like ""She Said"", ""No One"", ""End of the World"", and ""Confession"", but being such a huge fan of the rain, I would like to hear some stuff that has to do with rain. Guys, for your next album, please write a rain song just for me, then you'll be perfect. But hey, you're doing pretty good!"
4,Impressive nu-metal debut,"I got this CD basically because it was 7 bucks at Best Buy and I had a feeling it would be good. It was a well spent 7 bucks. This CD is one of the better nu-metal debuts of 2000-2001. The singers lyrics makes this band somewhat more special than bands like Limp Bizkit (who found this band and signed them, which is the best thing Fred's done in a while). A very good debut, I highly recommend it.Favorite songs: Just Got Wicked, She Said, No One, End of the World, Confession, Send in the Clowns"
3,FYI: This is NOT a live recording,"The title at the top says this is a ""live"" CD. It isn't. They are all studio cuts."
5,Musical Masterpiece,"This cd is one big masterpiece. Wheher its the extremely clean and slightly distorted guitars that does it for you or the extrmem emotional lyrics I totally reccomend this cd. There is not one bad song on it. At first you might not like it all that much but when you hear it more and more this cd becomes apart of your life. Just buy this cd, dont even listen to it to see if your remotely interested."
5,"Its Dark, But I Like It!","I bought this album because i heard the end of the world on the radio and loved it. the cd was only like 12 bucks so i decided to pick it up. after looking at the cd's flipbook, i realized cold is a dark and twisted group. when i first listened to the whole album i couldn't understand i word the lead singer was saying. i thought i bought a pretty bad cd. but after reading the lyrics and listening to it more, i began to understand the words and now i love the cd. i can totally relate to a lot of the songs. my favorite tracks are 4,5,6,8,9,11, and 13 (the slower songs are my favorite). this album is a great buy for people you like staind and other bands like them. now i want to get their first cd and their newest single ""gone away"" which i have seen on mtv."
5,This is a must have CD,This is one of the best CD's I have heard. I first heard/saw Cold at a concert where they opened for Staind. They were great onstage so I bought the CD. Every song on here is great. I absolutely love the last track. But every song on here is absolutely great.
4,DAMN GOOD,"I Like many others had only heard 'Just got Wicked', which is such a top tune. I therefore expected similar tracks on this album but on the first listening, all the other tracks sounded mediocre and none stood out. After 5 listen's the individual tracks started gaining their own individual personality and the album stopped sounding same-ish. I now view track 11 as better than 'Just got Wicked', and have found another 6 very good tracks.Just Got Wicked (JGW) isn't representative of this album. The album isn't as heavy as JGW, its more melodic with some great gitaur and similar to Staind in many ways. I've heard many people class this album as soft nu-metal but i feel rock with a dashing of metal, is a better description."
5,great album,Cold is defintely one of the best new bands I have heard. I saw them live when the opening up for Staind/Godsmack in the spring of 2001. I had never heard of cold before then and they really blew me away. I was amazed by their music and lyrics. I got 13 ways to bleed on stage to see how I would like it. I was not disappointed. The album definetely rock. It's nice to have a really good heavy metal that has a high level of emotion like with cold. Bleed with aaron lewis of staind at the end of the albums is the perfect way to end the album.
4,Likeable Metal for Those Who Aren't Even Into Metal,"I don't listen to much thrash metal, because at some point it becomes simply a noise. After hearing the song ""Just Got Wicked"" on MTV2, I didn't think twice about it. Just another Linkin Park, Powerman 5000, or some other novelty one-hit wonder. If Cold never releases another single I will be glad I bought this album, and I won't sell or trade it in (like Candlebox back in 96) when they die away. This album has mediocre lyrics. They still fall in the post-teenage angst category. But the album, while not as lyrically beautiful as Mer de Noms, does have grandiose thick melodic riffs as does the debut of A Perfect Circle. Rap-metal? You won't find it here. Thank Goodness. Just straight-up metal straight up your arse!"
1,Not nearly what I expected.,"Sorry, Cold. This album just does NOT cut it because I unfortunately bought THIS version instead of the explicit.When you're listening to the songs, you just can't help but notice the irritating edits they do on the cuss words. This was a total waste of my [money]. The ONLY songs I like are ""Just Got Wicked"", ""She Said"", No One, and ""Witch"". The rest all [are bad]!If you're into REAL hard rock, look to [other bands]."
1,I don't know what people here are talking about...,"...this band sounds like a million other bands out there, and they don't even excel in the clone arena. Listen to the clips and see for yourself.I bought it because I thought it was a cool title. It makes it seem like it's a heavy album or at least a rocker, but this is wussy rock at its worst."
1,this is pretty bad..ahahaha,"ok..This is funny..way to funny. I love wanna be goth bands..they ammuse me. As for this music...i thought it was horrid..not only is the music cheesy..they look cheesy. What is with the pathetic spider they have everywhere..lol. For me i think the music is very very hmmmm how can i put this into the right words...ummmm boring! And if the music is'nt bad enough..the videos are even worse! ahahaha And please to the person that put them into a ""depressed"" music zone..and compared them with Nine Inch Nails...don't ever do that..NIN is the best band ever! Not cheesy ""goth"" ... like you get with cold..i am 24..and lemme tell you..Cold is bad. I have heard some bad music..but they take the cake..Way to go cold!! Keep up the horrid work..and oh so predictable lyrics...i hate cheesy lyrics too. This cd will provide you with cheesy lyrics...so much ""goth"" wannabe ......and enough cheesy spider to keep you busy for awhile..what a waste of money..i could of bought some eye liner!"
3,It works....,"I purchased at $44 and soon found out the punch plate is not included. It's a rip, and Hitachi should be forced to suck the pipe for trying to bleed more money from their own consumers. It's not a good way to build brand loyalty. Nevertheless they'll not get a punch plate sale from me I simply punched out the holes in my sheet paper with a small piece of aluminum tubing. The sander itself is a pretty good quality unit. Slightly heavier than my Skil but a bit more aggressive. The grip takes a bit to get used to, but seems normal to me now. My advise, check similar priced sanders and purchase one with a punch plate included."
3,can't really use the sander out of the box,The sander looks like it is well built but the dust bag that is supplied with it is no good. The zipper will not stay ziped and I thought I could get it started the sew it at the start but it will open anywhere along the length of it after it is ziped. I agree with the previous review also that I should be able to punch the holes without spending $19 more.
4,perfect little sander,"Works great. I have owned this sander for a little over 3 years. I have abused it, dropped it and even used it as a hammer and it still works like the day I got it. The only issue I have had was the dust bag falling off. I have taken it off."
3,Not top notch,"I was thinking this would be a little more beefy than it is. Quite a good bit of plastic. It's lighter than what I'm used to. My biggest aggravation is that the clamps BARELY are able to grab a 1/4 sheet of sandpaper. If you miss cut that 1/4 sheet by 1/4"", you'll not be able to use this sander. Even if it is the right size exactly, it's still hard to put into the clamps. I would go for another brand if I were to do it again."
3,"A Long Time Coming, I think","I thought this book was a long time in coming, but think that it could have been done better. It does seem at times that the author just read a few DL books to bone up on Dalamar, especially (unless this is an editing error) when the author refers to Kitiara's last name as Majere, not Uth Matar. This idea for Dalamar could have probably been made into a trilogy, giving Dalamar's very early days and ending with the following of the Chaos war. This character was crammed into one book. The book is a fair read."
1,Stay away from this book!,I have long been a fan of Dragonlance novels but this is the worst one yet. Berberick does a good job of letting you get to know Dalamar and how he thinks but spends too much time doing it. I found myself skipping entire pages of rhetoric just to keep from falling asleep.
4,book,building my collection - thanks for helping - the rest of thsi is filler because of the darn minimum requirements - why do they do dumb stuff like this?
2,"Badly edited, slow paced, uneventful","The whole book is riddled with editorial errors. The errors are so obvious however, you would expect an author to know the simple facts Berberick stuffed up on. For example, Kitiara's surname is Uth Matar, not Majere. Several references in the war of the lance are incorrect also. That aside, Dalamar wasn't developed throughout the book at all. He was the same character from start to finish. All the battle scenes were boring to say the least. I felt none of the tension I usually do when reading a decent dragonlance book. Overall, it was a huge letdown. WotC should have got one of their more competant authors to write the story about one of Krynns favorites. Berberick was involved with desecrating Cryssania's name in ""Tears of the Night Sky"". She has done it again with ""Dalamar the Dark""."
1,Phewwwww...,"I don't remeber much of this book because it's been awhile since I read it, and because I dind'tenjoyed it. I bought it and was happy to have a book about Dalamar, who I liked so much in ""Legends"", but the book was a huge disappointment. Boring and repetitive, and when it began to be addictive is when Dalamar goes to Raistlin's Tower... where the book ends.Don't waste your money on it unless you're a really HUUUUGELY ADDICTED fan of the Dragonlance series."
3,Good if you have read all the others,"To anyone looking at buying this book, it is well-written by a good author in a great series, but if you are ""erked"" by errors relating to the other books in this series, you're gonna hate this one. There are many errors, but the one that gets me the most is the near complete push-over of Kitiara and the creation of a never-before heard of Highlord in her spot, who goes on to rampage over Solamnia until being stopped at the High Clerist's Tower. Also, if you thrive on battle sequences, you're looking at the wrong book. For any elf-lovers like me, this is the best elf-book since the Puppet King. But, like I said, the errors in the chronology and characters of the world of Krynn can get to you after awhile."
5,Inspirational in a strange way,"Am I the only person that was inspired by this book? Dalamar starts off being a servent and ends up being the apprentice to the most powerful mage that ever lives. I thought the story was great, even the parts that weren't about Dalamar. The way he found his new name and his pledge to the god of black magic, Nuitari, was really cool. I definatly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of dark magic. No matter what other people say about this book, it is really good."
2,Leaves Dalamar fans wanting more,"I found this book to be a good source of information concerning Lorac's nightmare and nothing more. This book titled 'Dalamar the dark' centered more on the events transpiring around him than it did on Dalamar himself. As a long time Dalamar fan I found it very disappointing, it left me knowing little more about the mysterious elf than I had known before. A lot of things about this book disappoint me, but all that really needs to be said is..Dalamar deserves far better. Am I the only one that thinks that picture of Dalamar looks more human than elven, besides the ears of course ;)"
2,Not very accurate,"This is just another tale pumped out by TSR to make as much money from the dragonlance stories, the story does no justice to dalmar who is an iteresting character in the DL saga,the author wrote about him it seems after reading a review of of the DL books. To me its just seems like this book was written just to squeeze out my 6 bucks."
4,Above Average,While it had a few flaws this was in the long run a pretty good book. The fact that the point of view was almost compleatly from the point of view of a evil character is a good twist from common novels. Also the story while a touch slow at time is well written as to the history of Dalamar.
4,Dalamar: the Early Years,"This Dragonlance Classics book tells the story of Dalamar's youth in Silvanesti and his eventual calling to the dark arts. He is cast out of his Elven home and left on his own to pursue his fate. He goes to the Tower to be tested, and is willingly used by the leadership of the Tower to complete a task that would allow more than one person the revenge they seek. Berberick's telling is good although her characterization of Dalamar falls slightly short of his personality from what we know of him from other stories. Her perspective of the fall of Silvanost and Lorac's Nightmare is insightful and well written, and ties well into the Chronicles storyline. This is a good book for someone who has already read the core books of the Dragonlance series."
4,Very informative and entertaining,"While this wasnt a book that I couldnt put down. It was still a very good story. It revealed a lot about where exactly Dalamar came from and what I liked most was we saw the war of the lance through his eyes. Considering he wasn't in the storylines until the legends trilogy. Anyway, good tie-ins to the main dragonlance story and the book also gives us another good view of how the conclave works, and what the test is like (i've only seen what it was like for Raistlin)."
4,Gatt,"I found this book to be very well written. It does a good job of explaining why Dalamar chose the path he did. There are a few errors, but most are just minor like the Majere, Uth Matar error mentioned above, this happened even in Dragons of Summer Flame where Usha is called Jenna, typos nothing more. The majority is set in War of the Lance as it must, and does an extremely good job of describing Lorac's choice as well the forces that pushed Dalamar to the Dark. Overall a very good book."
4,Dalamar not all bad!,"I have loved Dalamar (almost as much as his Shalafi) ever since he first walked onto the pages of the Legends trilogy. I've walked the dark shadows and lived in the obsidian glory of his black magick, and I've lived to tell the tale. I've used him in many of my own campaigns, and I can never cease to adore this wonderous Dark Elf. To say that his tale was badly written is by far an injustice of our over-expectant society. While they spent far too much time telling us about what was going on in elven society, it was much needed and very helpful. Since reading this wonderous novel my own campaigns have become much more colorful and very spicy. I was given insight on the wonders of the mage-hood, as well as the ways of the elves, beliefs, the caste-system. Not to mention insight on this glorious man, his thoughts, feelings, emotions; things I never would have considered before. I'm more in love with him now then ever I was when first our eyes met......"
1,The most disappointing book I've ever bought.,"If you're a deer hunter who actually enjoys watching late night infomercials, have I got a book for you! John Weiss' ""The Advanced Deer Hunter's Bible"" is 190 pages of commercial endorsements thinly disguised as a book about deer hunting. Weiss doesn't even camoflage the advertisements with the old ""I used Dr. Zook's Buck Dee-See-Ver and shot the biggest buck of my life!"" Instead he ""proves"" the value of the products by quoting ""experts"" who just happen to work for the company that makes the stuff. There may be valuable information in there somewhere, but I was too disgusted to find it after wading through ten separate Name-Brand endorsements in the first eleven pages of text. My advice is to save your $10.36 plus shipping and handling or spend it on three issues of ""Outdoor Life"". That way, the advertisements are labeled and if you don't learn anything useful you can still read Pat McManus. I give this book one star only because zero isn't an option."
3,Informative and helpful tool for hunting the Whitetale Deer,"The first, second, and third chapters are very important to any serious deer hunter. Weiss has shown great insight on what keeps this animal alive. Keen eye's can spot any movement, a nose that can pick up sent 10,000 times greater than man's, and ears that can detect and pin point sound from any direction. Weiss has also given helpful information concerning maps, and were to purchase them so you can focus on food sources, traveling patterns, and bedding areas for whitetale deer. However I must add this personal note: I have found a more informative book for hunting, using scents, and scouting deer habitat. (Southern Deer & Deer Hunting, by Dr. Larry Weishuhn & Bill Bynum.)"
2,It's heavy,"On ""Angry machine"", Dio is mainly going for the heavy (and slow), sometimes rather similar to the style on ""Strange highway"". Of course, Ronnie James Dio is a great singer and that is what saves many of the songs on this uneven effort. Everything isn't slow and heavy - there's a couple of speedy songs included and they are absolutely the better ones. This album doesn't have any song with so called hit potential, like ""Rainbow in the dark"", but it contains a more or less traditional ballad, ""This is your life"" (something Dio hasn't done since the Rainbow days) on which Dio is singing beautifully. Dedicated Dio fans will certainly find pleasure in this album, but the casual listener should get ""Holy diver"", ""The last in line"" or ""Killing the dragon"" instead."
2,Not the mans best work...,"This record isn't ""bad"" per say. It's simply very confused. I remember an Rolling Stone article in which they spoke to him on the issue and it was clear that he didn't want to give up metal, but he seemed confused as to what metal was at the time.This is the poor mans ""Dehumanizer"". Socially concious lyrics filled with bleak imagry and anger but lacking in something purely emotional at the same time. The riffs are heavy but plodding and few songs catch the mind. (""Double Monday"" and ""Big Sister"" manage to be fun at times though...)This CD is pretty much a decent but forgettable effort from a man losing his direction. Not a great CD...but a bit more original for the man than his attempts to reclaim the fantasy realm on ""Magica""."
1,I don't know....,"How amazon knew I had this one... one of the worst things RJD has done, nothing really good to say about it. I much prefer Strange highways and Heaven and Hell to this one, and to further drive the point home, well, put it this way.... I've copied every Dio CD to tape, so I could listen to them on the tape decks in my truck and my boat.... except this one. I gave it one star only because it is Ronnie James, after all."
1,What? PIANOS?,This is Ronnie James Dio? What is this piano [stuff]? There isn't a single song on this entire CD worthy of any kind of Dio compilation CD. Stinks.
1,Save your money,"This disk had two major problems. When the menu comes up, you cannot choose any of the items. Frankly I don't know what I did that made the dvd start, and when I tried to do it again, failed. The second problem is that even though there is only 1 and 1/2 hours of material on the disk, they used extreme compression, making the fast movements virtually unwatchable. Compression should never be used in sports or other fast moving subjects, as it obliterates any details. The ""birth of an axe murderer"" fight with Vanderlei Silva was very good to watch though, earning the disk a star."
2,Another 'formula' book on India's stereotypes,"Just as there are formula Bollywood movies, now there is formula 'literature' written about India, in which one of the common and over-done themes is about abused Indian woman. Bad mother-in-law, abusive husband, dowry and maybe even death, superstitious and backward Hindu practices and beliefs, poverty and pollution (viewed as a sort of chronic feature that was always part of India), and general social backwardness - in other words, badly in need of being rescued. Of course, the cure to this plight is held by one or more of the following privileged groups: Western Feminists; 'South Asians' since they already escaped into Westernization; and Proselytizers."
3,"Taste of India, Thin Plot","The prose of this book is beautiful and quite evocative of India even down to the fractured English used by the Indians , unfortunately there is little plot for the beautiful word smithing to hang on to. The characters for the most part seem shallow and poorly drawn as well. If you like to read beautiful prose without much of a plot this book is for you but if you are looking for plot and character development you'll be bored."
5,sister india,"This novel provides an extraordinary journey, geographical and spiritual. In the company of unforgettable American as well as Indian characters, Payne takes us into the vibrant, unsettling, seethingly violent atmosphere of India. I've never literally visited there, but by the end of her book I felt I had. More than that, I took away with me the lives of her extraordinary characters, each searching for answers to their lives. This is a book you won't forget.Open any page and you'll see why."
5,An Extraordinary Find,"I won this CD through a contest on my college's radio station. Having never heard of KBA, I had no idea what to expect of this album. It was remarkably good. The music has a soft melodious sound to it. Its an album that one can just listen to and get a feeling of total relaxation. I recomend this to anyone who feels a need for a slight change in their musical collection."
5,Buy it even if you have no intention of going there.,"Having lived in Jakarta for 18 months,reading Mr Bacons book took me straight back to the city that's ' in danger of imploding.'Straight back to the smells,the noises and the heat.The infomation and incredible insight that is packed into this book is quite amazing. I think it's difficult to understand quite how accurate this book iis until you've actually lived there. Really humourously written little stories had me chukling all the way through.I reckon , even if you are not about to move to Jakarta or even visit the place ,its well worth reading."
4,Culture Shock! Jakarta at Your Door,"I found this book an exceptionally good read. Bacon takes us on a ride through the hot and crazy world of Jakarta in a way which is both informative and entertaining; summing up with great humour what he rightly describes as a ""complex problem"". Not only does he cover enough practical information to leave even the most unforwarned visitor feeling fully prepared, but he goes to great pains to explain the nature of `Indonesian-ness' - and how to avoid the inevitable `clash of culture' that foreign visitors might expect. As well as covering broader areas such as History, Politics and Culture with clarity and sensitivity, the author peppers the book throughout with the kind of detail and annecdote which brings the book alive. Bacon really hits the mark with this one."
2,Extremely negative!,"The writer thinks he's extremely intelligent and clever, but he's really kind of a self-centered jerk. The really strange thing is that he seems to hate everything about Jakarta. At times, I was thinking to myself, ""If you hate it so much, why did you LIVE there for so long!?""In some parts of the book, he manages to be completely incoherent while simultaneously thinking he's clever. This is a direct quote from the book:""As you might have gathered, in Indonesia, Java wears the trousers. And if Java is a pair of trousers, then Jakarta must be the zip area.""No, I didn't gather that. In fact, I thought about it for a long time, and even asked a couple of other people, and I still have no idea what that means. How is Jakarta like a crotch? And if it is like a crotch, is that a good thing or a bad thing?"
2,Zoe's Bars,"My family didn't like the taste of these bars. I think that we are all a little nervous about anything peanut butter right now. They do like the Chocolate Delight bars and the Zoe's breakfast cereals, so I will keep buying products from Zoe."
3,"Great value, good nutritionally","But the taste is not great. Certainly edible, but the peanut butter bar (I bought both peanut butter and chocolate peanut butter flavors, and this one is esentially a peanut butter bar dipped in chocolate) has a slightly bitter taste. I'll certainly eat them but wouldn't buy again."
3,Just OK,"We eat A LOT of bars at my house and have tried too many brands to count. Overall, these bars are a nice change of pace and are unlike many of the run-of-the-mill ones out there. The PB taste is just better than average. Nutrition-wise, this bar is a wiser choice than many. But the bars themselves are dense and chalky -- think, halvah bar without the oil and taste. I won't go out of my way to order these again. There are better tasting bars, imo."
2,Not edible,"I've tried these and the chocolate peanut butter ones. These aren't edible, IMHO. Strong vitamin taste with another bad aftertaste. Was incredibly hard to finish the box, I gave most away. The recipients didn't like them either. I also don't think the nutrient value was high enough to put up with that taste.I didn't mind the chocolate peanut butter ones, however, and even though they are waxy, the taste was tolerable (chocolatey coating offset that awful aftertaste) and all of these bars are definitely good as an occasional quick breakfast replacement or mid-day snack to keep you going. Filling."
2,tastes bad,"Ugh. This has a bland, peanut butter taste with an unfortunate ""vitamin"" aroma. The texture is hard-chewy and kind of stale even though it's not past its expiration date. Did not like this at all. Bought these bars based upon the 4 star rating here, but what a disappointment."
2,Logo on hat TOO big,My husband did not like this hat. The color is bottomland which he really liked but the logo is so big in the front he does not want to wear it. Will try to return.
2,Not worth the money.,"The only thing I liked about this saw was the size -- perfect to fit in your back pocket as you're walking around. The handle is plastic that my dog broke in five minutes of chewing, and I bent the blade on the second branch I cut (it was about 1 1/2 inch diameter, and fairly soft wood). I know you can replace the blade, but the problem is that sabre and reciprocating blades are just too thin and flexible to use on anything but tiny twigs that you'd use a pair of pruners on anyway. Save yourself the annoyance and buy something with a heavier blade."
5,Nice collection,"Kids of all ages love Barbara Park's stories. Easy to listen to, both for car rides and bedroom quiet times."
3,Junie B CD,"I purchased the books on CD for my daughter because my son had them on cassette tape. However, to my dismay, the stories are split between 5 CDs and some stories are continued from one CD to the next. The stories themselves are wonderful, however, my advice is to purchase them on cassette tape so you don't have to switch CDs mid-story."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"It's a good thing I listened to these before Christmas day - as much as half of some of the files for several chapters are damaged! My daughter is a HUGE fan of the Junie B Jones series, so I was really excited to see that the audio books were available. My plan was to download them onto the MP3 player I bought her for Christmas. Imagine my surprise when the media player stalled out at the end of not one, not two, but ALL of the five disks in the series. If she weren't such a fan, I'd just get my money back. I'm going to try and get a replacement and pray that it works."
5,Complete Earthly Woman,"Complete Earthly Woman is an astonishingly simple tool that has truly transformed my life. Using the ancient art of conscious breathing, coupled with sacred invocations, the body energetically sheds the cellular memory of pain, suffering and abuse. Since the body is an energetic instrument, it makes logical sense that toxic energy remains anchored in our system, causing physical and emotional illness. To heal means to release from the energetic blockages that imprison us in our old patterns. True liberation comes from shifting this energy and actually purifying our bodies and our minds. In the tradition of alternative healeing such as Reiki and Acupuncture, this is a form of energy balancing that simply uses conscious breathing to shift and change the energy of the body and mind so that it can accept new, empowering beliefs. This is a book that I would recommend to anyone who is ready to heal and claim their true power!"
3,Good times if you have good eyes,I was a little disappointed when I recieved this puzzle book. I realize that there are 1001 puzzles but I never thought the print wound be so small. I can not use it.
3,Chari Chari '- In Time,"Japanese downtempo with an international flair -- Chari Chari brings it to us just IN TIME. ""Dil Ki Dharkan,"" for instance, has a prominent Indian influence, while ""Liberation"" brings in African rhythms, and ""Tidal Wave"" does the same for Brazil. There's a summery spoken-word on ""Folk Tales"" and a long, ambient journey on ""Landing,"" but overall, the album is pleasant and forgettable."
1,Ancient Secrets of the Bible,Perhaps my expectations were too high. I found these stories to be re-enactments instead of documentary in type. They were tacky.
1,I really had high hopes :(,"After all the positive reviews I had such high hopes for this bag. We used it to go from Ohio to Florida and back on top of my mini van. We paid attention to how it was attached and the zipper placement. The bag came apart at the seam on top in the front under the pressure of the wind. We arrived and all our stuff was wet. There was a football size hole where the seam had just split. I'm glad our stuff didn't end up all over the road, Had it torn further that would have been a real possibility. I looked over the bag before we used it and didn't see and defects so I really am not sure why it failed but it did so user beware."
4,Great for the Price!,"This is good product because you don't have to add railings to your roof to use it. It's larger than it looks, but the down side is that it makes a weird noise because of the wind, sounds like humming. It's annoying at first, but turning up your music can fix that problem! I drove this through rain and snow, and nothing inside got wet. Overall, I would purchase it again."
2,roof bag,This bag held up good however it is not at all waterproof we had to dry all our clothes when we arrived atOur destination
2,It lasted a trip,"I'm rating this two stars, one star for the trip down to Florida from Illinois, and one star for the trip back. It started out waterproof, but by the time we got back home, you could see that the fabric was starting to deteriorate and you could easily see light through the spots where there was a lot of wear.It might work better for shorter trips, or maybe needs a more rigid tote inside. We had two smaller luggages that were well within any sort of weight constraints.It did stay on very well and hardly moved during the entire duration of the trip traveling at highway speeds."
4,"Pretty good quality, quite good for the price",Have used this both with a crossbar (Thule) roof rack and without a roof rack. Works fine both ways. There's some wind noise even if you tie all of the straps down. I use cable ties (zip ties) to get rid of the slack straps on the roof.
2,not stout enough,"has felt bottom to protect car roof which was nice. easily and securely straps to luggage rack. Had a little rain on the trip and it was dry on the inside. However, the bag developed multiple small tears in several areas after one two day trip, so Im returning it for a refund. Will try a different product if I ever need a roof carrier again."
2,Bag Ripped,"I was doing a multi-state move from Louisiana to California, and the bag ripped just outside San Antonio. It tore along the seams, and in the bag were mostly clothes. However, until then the bag seemed pretty good, and was sturdy.My suggestion is that anyone who purchases this needs to assess how far the bag will be expected to go. This is not a heavy-duty bag, and shouldn't have much weight packed into it. Luckily I got a full refund on it, and the company handled the return very well."
4,Works for me!,"Fastened this to the top of a Nissan Quest. We were a bit worried about the straps. They just don't seem like they will hold the bag while going down the highway, so we also secured the bag with some bungee cords. Everything stayed in place. We filled our rooftop bag with duffel bags full of clothing, air mattresses, sleeping bags and pillows. We wrapped them all in garbage bags just in case of rain, but we didn't encounter any, so I cannot vouch as to whether or not this bag is weatherproof. It is a large bag, though. My mother was playing around with my twin 7-year olds and they all got inside the bag together and folded the top closed. I was shocked to see that they all fit inside!"
4,Great Roof Top Bag for the Money,"This bag goes on and off easy! The bag zips open on three sides so the top folds back. you put the bags on fold the top back over, zip it up and attach the straps to the car. we went through an extremely heavy rain and the suitcase at the front did get a little wet. Next time I would put the suitcases in contractor trash bags before putting them in the roof top bag. For the amount of times I'll need to use a rooftop bag, I didn't see any reason to spend hundreds of dollars on a waterproof one.This product is so easy to use that I wouldn't hesitate to put things on the roof and save the room in the car."
1,Did not survive the trip,The Lund roof top bag made it about 1/3 of the trip. After the halfway point it became another item of baggage in a very tight space. The front seam started unravelling and about a 6 inch hole had developed along the front part of the bag. It was easy to use and attach.
1,Got a hole on day 3 of using it,"We purchased this to use on our move back to Chicago from California. We had good weather the whole trip home with just a little bit of drizzle the one day and by the time we made it to Oklahoma it had a big hole in the front corner. We tried to tie it up and tie it down but it kept on blowing back up and tearing more. Not sure if we ended up getting a defective one or if all of them are this poorly made, but it was a huge incovenience. We were forced to jam pack everything it contained inside our SUV that was already full of 2 adults, a baby, and a 50lb dog. We couldn't open the doors without stuff falling out."
4,Lund 601016 Soft Pack Roof Top Bag,"The Roof Top Bag worked well. However, we did not rely totally on the straps provided. We provided our own tie downs to ensure the bag would stay on the car. Also, we went through a rainstorm and the items inside did get wet."
1,Bad roof anchors,"In our trip we lost the bag and our luggage because of the bad roof anchors, they were too small to support all the weight and force of the wind, since our car did not had a roof rack. Before departing it seems very tight and in less than an hour we were surprised with nothing on our roof."
3,Easy to Install but not water proof/resistant,"I have a Toyota sienna van with a roof rack, the Lund soft pack roof to bag was very easy to install. I was able to fit 1 big duffle bag 2 medium size bags and 2 small bags. It had plenty of room to alleviate the load inside the van. We took a 12 hr trip from FL to NC through rain. The big duffle bag was wet underneath. My wife thinks it was because I put the roof top bag on a wet roof. It makes sense because the other bags were not wet. I will try it again and be more cautious about the roof being wet, other than that I was happy with the size and the price of $30."
3,Lund Soft Pack Roof Top Bag,"My sons and I decided we would need a little more room than my new Forester could afford to haul camping gear to the mountains in GA. The bag did exactly as was stated and all gear was secure, however, it impeded my speed and caused my otherwise very gas-thrifty vehicle to gobble gas due to wind resistance. Hence, for short trips that you don't mind spending more in gas due to wind drag, the bag is great. It is sturdy, everything stayed dry, even in the rain but I moved my younger son into a corner seat and used additional inside space going home w/o the roof top. Gas consumption was way down and speed was easier to maintain."
4,Great choice,This Roof Top Bag was such the right purchase. I tried to purchase the same roof top at Sears and the price would of been double. I've taken two long road trips with it: from Atl to Miami and Atl to Montreal fill to to the max and it is still strong. I like the 4 attachements that came with it to place on the side of the racks bar. I was indeed very satisfied with this product.
1,4 inch rip after 3 hours!,"This bag ripped along a seam after only 3 hours on the road! I could see where the puncture holes made by the needle of the sewing machine had run off the material at the seam. If Lund had done some QC I think an inspector would have rejected it.Also the inside plastic lining was all shredded. No more ""Lund"" products for me!Amazon gave me a refund."
1,not worth the money,This bag started peeling apart in the inside during our trip - ripped apart so much that we didn't even use it for the ride home.we didn't even let it outside over night and it could not hold up. spend the money and get a higher quality bag!!!
5,Don't be dissuaded if you've never heard the brand,"I was a little hesitant because of better known brands, but I saw the good reviews. Worked like a charm. Does not need cross bars. Rained, and my stuff stayed dry. Very easy to take on and off, which was a big plus for me since I needed to go in and out of parking garages in NYC during my trip. Very roomy. you can stick 3-4 medium sized suitcases in it. Straps stayed tight throughout trip. I had a different soft top last year, and this one is so much better!"
5,buy this bag,this bag was great gave us alot more room and went thru a very bad storm and nothing got wet at all these bag is great
4,"Okay, not great","Has done the job on a few trips now. for the price, you can't beat it, but it is certainly not 'weatherproof'. Went through a nasty rainstorm, and there was a little moisture in the bag. I can live with it since it was so cheap. Just have to know not to put your camera, or any other 'moisture sensitiive' items in the bag. One positive of this over a hard shell is that when you get to where you are going, after you unpack, you can fold this bag up and get it off the roof of your vehicle right away."
2,Made it to Disney and Back,It made it to Disney and back but tore while getting it down. Not very well made and the stuff inside did get a little wet.
4,good buy,"This cargo bag was very roomy and extremely easy to use--just strap it to existing roof rack. It stayed very secure on our 900 mile vacation. The only negative comment is that the term ""water resistant"" should be used very loosely. We only experienced one brief rain shower that lasted only about fifteen minutes during our trip, and the items inside the bag were wet. Definitely worth the price if you don't experience rain."
1,Time ran out on this clock,"Compact design but cheap materials. A vital piece of plastic came off when I set it down on the bedstand. Another exhibit in the ""you get what you pay for"" sweepstakes. I threw it away."
3,Romeo and Juliett with Vampires and Werewolfs,"I was always asking myself if a prequel to the Underworld franchise was absolutely necessary. We saw already the fate of Victor's daughter and her story with Lucian in flashbacks, so why make a film about it. After these opening words you ask yourself, dear reader, why three stars. I can tell you why: I'm a big creature movie fan and this film has plenty of those and I do have a soft spot for vereything that is set in medieval times and I'm a big fan of Patrick Tatopoulos work. So if you're like me you will dig the film, otherwise leave it alone."
4,series,"love the series, this is entertaining. love the series, this is entertaining. love the series, this is entertaining. love the series, this is entertaining"
4,great movie,"I tend to think that movies get worse the more they make of a series. But IMO this is one of the exceptions to the rule. It's a very good back story ""prequel""."
5,Awesome,The DVD is in great condition. There are no scratches on it at all. I got it fairly quickly in the mail. Also the box didn't have any damage it on it as well. The movie was good. All in all I'm very pleased with my purchase.
4,An action packed and exciting prequel,"Underworld: Rise Of The Lycans, is an action packed and exciting prequel. Though, some of the scenes are very dark, overall the video is good.The sound is good during the action sequences. During scenes where there is dialog, the dialog is whispered. Overall, audio is fair.I thought the story was good, yet the ending was disappointing. They should have come up with an ending that offered something new. Instead, they chose to bridge the ending (adding overdubbed dialog) with the first movie, Underworld, regarding Viktor and Selene's relationship. This comes off as treating the audience as forgetful simpletons, who need to be spoon fed plot points.I am looking forward to a fourth installment that hopefully will offer something new and will not take the audience for granted."
1,Cliched and tedious,"First of all, the actor playing Lucien doesn't seem right for the part. In the first movie, when he started growling while transforming in that flashback scene, it looked silly rather than frightening. I think it's because the way he's made up, his forehead is too big, and his face is scrunched up under it. He doesn't radiate power or danger but looks more like a brainy type. I don't know if that was intentional in the casting, but it's weird.Second, it's just boring. Although it was nice to see Tannis again, in his former glory. The plot moves too slowly, and the Victor chews the scenery with every line - always looks like his face muscles are about to pop out of his skin.I got to where Lucien is waiting for whatshername at the clearing and I simply didn't care anymore. I hope it didn't get better after that, because I sent that DVD right back."
1,WORST UNDERWORLD!!! WORST MOVIE EVER!!!,"I'm sorry, but this movie sucked.Also, no Kate Beckinsale = Horrible Horrible Horrible MovieWho gives this 4 or 5 stars? teenie boppers?"
2,uuhhh,"I guess stuffing a napkin in the upper lip of a actress merits overdoing a movie. they should have stopped with second one... first one was amazing. they are just milking it now, at least come up with a different plot if you're going to make a prequel, seriously... this isn't star wars."
1,"You knew the whole story from the 1st movie, a waste of film","Yea the babe is hot, but really, this entire movie was told in 5 mikes in the 1st movie."
4,Underworld/Rise of The Lycans,DVD in excellent shape. I have all of the Underworld movies made. I loved the movie.
4,Good movie that leads into first one,"Underworld 3: Rise of the Lycans might be the third movie in the set. But you actually have to watch this 3rd movie before watching the rest of the movies because this movie sets the first movie up. Not to spoil the movie set ups. The intro to the first movie is the ending of the 3rd dilogue wise. But as for the movie itself great movie, good plotline, and some great horror scenes. I give you an example of the fight scene when the lycans get shot in the head by the arrows brutal but amazing to watch if your a fan of horror. I do hope they make more Underworld movies, I'll state my reason in my other reviews. So if your a fan of horror movies, lots of blood gore and some good story lines then pick this movie up and watch for yourself a good horror movie. Plus had many great movie lines from the main actor in it."
5,love this series,"I love the series. Got this one, it plays perfectly in my dvd player, and its a good movie. Not much else to say about it. :)"
5,Vampires versus Lycans with Rhona Mitra!,"Underworld: Rise of the Lycans.Lucian (Michael Sheen), is leader of the werewolves.Viktor (Bill Nighy), is the vampire leader.Sonja (Rhona Mitra-one of my favorite actors) is Viktor's daughter.In short, this is a fast paced, exciting movie. Sonja (Rhona Mitra)is tough, intelligent, and couragous. The acting is good. Also, the special effects are decent.This is a five star movie-"
2,It's ONLY saving grace is Rhona Mitra,"From the first poorly done CGI frame, to the very last poorly edited scene, this Blu Ray was a whimpering dog of a flick! I really enjoyed the first ""Underworld"". Heck, it featured Kate Beckensale in skin tight black leather, so what's not to like?? But, this movie was so poorly edited, scripted, and poorly acted, even the lovely Ms Mitra could not make it watchable.Do yourself a favor, DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE. Even Blu Ray can make this watchable. The sound was really awful, and the transfer was so poor, the entire experience seemed as though we were watching a VHS tape version.Please believe me when I tell you this is the kind of experience that will have you writing to the studio with a demand to be compensated for all of the time you wasted watching this excruciatingly horrid flick."
3,Bad Copy?,"This was the first Blu-Ray movie I ever ordered. I enjoyed the story line well enough (being a prequel to the first two), but the screen appeared fuzzy and grainy. I have played other BD's before and since with no interference, so maybe I just got a bad copy. I checked all of the speaker, power, and HDMI cables, and the HDTV is a 40"" Samsung LCD, being played with a PS3 80g (both less than six months old)."
5,"Love the movie, much better that the 2","I love the Underworld Movies Trilogy, specially the first one and this one (not so much the second). In this movie we see how Lucius and the werewolves were created and what happen before the first movie (yes, it's a prequel). If you are a true fan, you are going to love this one, it's a keeper!"
3,Underworld Rise of the Lycans,"I've seen all three of the Underworld movies. I own the first and just received the 3rd. I like them all, but like this one the best. They are a must for Vampire and werewolf fans."
5,Interesting,"Love all movies of this line. Its a special movie about vampires, not just regular shitty one.Enjoyed watching it..."
3,Fun Movie For Fans of the Series,"This is a fun movie for fans of the series. It provides an entertaining back story and some fun action sequences. Lets be honest, its hard to go wrong with vampires, werewolves, action, and a love story. But at the same time, I think we would be hard pressed to call this a great movie. It is clearly not as good as the first or second in the series but worth watching on a lazy weekend."
4,Better than predecessor=good as original...,"Underworld was a great film, I thought. The second one, not so much. I did enjoy this one,though. It details the history of the vampires and lycans, the feud that began between them, and how it began. It has great special effects with a passable story. There are holes in it, but it is interesting. It is a quick moving film. One minute you begin the film, then you are at the end. If you are a fan of the Underworld saga, this is a great one to view and/or add to your collection. In this film, everything from the first two films comes around into a circle and to an end."
5,Start Here!,"Although this is the second of the Underworld series released, it's actually the pre-quel to the series. The war between the lycans and the vampires is gone into in great detail and sets the tone for the rest of the series. If you like the Underworld series and don't own this, you should."
3,I wanted to Love this really ...but,"I am a total fan of the Underworld story and they all have that Romeo and Juliet story line, but....this fell a bit short to me.They show Lucien and Sonja ""in love"" but it's sort of rushed. It was missing a ""feeling"" of ""I would die for you type of love"" although it was mentioned a few times. The connection was lacking passion.Too many CGI lycans not enough practical effects. It was a distraction.Perfect casting though...I mean really! Except for the obvious, Craven (Shane Brolly) missing, he would have added some edge to the story. Besides he was so much ""brooding"" fun in the first movie.Wish it had been as good as the first ...but they rarely are.Although, I have only seen it once and it may warrant revisiting based on other reviews."
2,This movie is a waste of time.,"To begin, let me state that I enjoyed the first two installments of the ""Underworld"" series. This movie however, is a complete waste of time, unless you want to see Bill Nighy chew scenery. Michael Sheen returns as Lucian (the head lycan from the first movie), and the amazing thing here is they actually made him look younger in this, the prequel. Aside from those things, however, the movie offers absolutely nothing new to the story that's already been laid down in the first two movies, a fact that culminates in one of the worst endings to a movie I've ever seen, structurally speaking. The rule of thumb for storytelling is, the ending should be inevitable but unexpected. Guess what? You saw the ending coming, from about 2 movies ago. Skip this one, unless you desperately need to see Michael Sheen with his shirt off, or have a mad-on for watching Bill Nighy gnaw own every scene he's in."
4,Great,This product was labeled nearly new and it met to the highest of standards. This product is keeping in line with everything I have ever bought from amazon.
2,Spartacus + Werewolves + Vampires + Love Story + Video-Game Special Effects + Dull fighting scenes,"It's like Spartacus plus werewolves and vampires. The special effects are very bad. They look like cheap video games. The fighting scenes are half baked. They don't look exciting, intense and real as the ones from Underworld 2.The only good thing about this move is the love between Michael Sheen and Rhona Mitra. It provides a couple of touching scenes. But they are too few to make the film worth while.I prefer Underworld 2 because of the fighting and Kate Beckinsale. She looks sexy in that film."
3,I was disappointed,"It doesn't mean you won't love the book. I found it to be far too narrow and, even as an Oracle OCP, boringly written. That may say more about me than it does about Jonathin Lewis, who I know is brilliant and has written brilliant stuff before. I just didn't get as much out of it as I thought I would."
4,Got my money's worth the first day,"I just bought this book and already got my money's worth just from the information on transitive closure. I've run into this problem a couple times already and am glad to have a better understanding of it now. Looking forward to reading the rest . . .(I know my rating is premature considering I've only read a few pages so far - that's why I didn't give it 5 stars, but it's off to a very strong start so I felt that 4 stars was fair at this point. How often do you pick up a new book and learn something valuable that you can apply immediately on day 1? I may raise or lower my rating later if my opinion changes after reading more.)"
2,No guidelines,"I disagree with Mr. Kyte about this book helping one to understand Oracle and I found the exact opposite.The book has dozens of examples but no cohesion and no conclusions. If I cut out all of the supercilious code listings that make up over 3/4ths of this book there would be very little left, and even less of this was useful to me. Loads of random examples and thoughts, but no summaries, no conclusions, and no guidelines for the reader.I really wanted to like this book after reading all of the glowing reviews, but I now feel that this book was a waste of my money. Normally I would not be so harsh but the almost unbelievable glowing praise for this book is out of line with its real quality and I wonder about this mutual admiration society that posts these reviews that influences us customers."
2,How much of it is useful ???,"I took two days and went through the book. Sounds more likeR&D; book rather than something which I am going to use. If you want to learn good SQL tuning, stick with Guy Harrison - it is more practical."
5,Another brilliant book by Jonathan Lewis,"This is the book that one definitely needs to read (and understand) in order to get an idea what the CBO is all about.Jonathan's examples and presentation is excellent. Though the topic is quite intense, the book is quite pleasant to read. This book is a worthy follow up the classic ""Practical Oracle8i"".As regards the usefulness of the book in real world scenarios, I can only say that if one wants to approach SQL tuning as a science, one needs to learn the CBO, and this book is essential.This is volume 1 or 3. I will definitely be eagerly waiting for the next volumes."
5,Chart topper from this energetic UK band,"Yet again the Beautiful South have achieved a masterpiece of a chart entry. With Paul Heatons stunning dry vocals and the bands witty play on words, its a winner once more!"
1,"Sniff Sniff, ewww whats that smell!?!","I agree with the other review about this case being bulky, the only thing I will probably use it for is when I take my Zen to the Gym or something.My biggest complaint with this thing though is it REEKS! When I got it in the mail I could even smell in through the packaging, I wish it smelt like leather but is smells like cornholes :(I recommend trying to find another case"
3,A very tight case (>_<),"I bought this case together with my vision M.. it arrived first than my Mp3. The case would be an excellent case if it work as is suppost to. Its too tight on the mp3 which makes hard to press the bottom buttons and tap the middle pad. It leaves a black mark eveytime i remove the mp3 from the case, which is easy to clean, but anoying. It's like the manufactures took the measurements of the mp3, but never really try it on the mp3. I'll just try to talk nice to the case... maybe it gets softer and loose for my mp3 (^.^)"
5,Little Giant never dissapoints,This arrived on time and everything works as we expected. My husband has a 20 year old Little Giant and a new one that is much lighter and had other improvements so he is all set now.
5,Choral Moods,Excellent! By far the best collection of choral pieces I have ever heard. Far superior to The King's College Choir. The Bach/Gounod Ave Maria and the Bach/Marlow Advent Responsory are magnificent.
3,Very relaxing and 'nice' overall...,"But I found it kind of boring. There was no 'spark' or 'accent' throughout the whole album. True, it IS extremely relaxing (if I play it in my car I almost fall asleep while driving) but I guess I had different expectations. Good CD to listen to when I'm depressed or just gloomy, though!"
1,Not much new information,"I found this book to be rather slow, boring and repititious... lacking any interesting information."
1,Intamates Through Time,"This book was a terrible dissapointment. The author claims to have been anvisor to Pharoh, Tribal Chief and beloved leader in many of his past lives. I find his delusions of granduer in poor form. I was so disgusted with the author that I chose not to finish reading this book. The writing techinque was poor, The infromation given was scattered and hard to follow. The author must think his audience a fool who will beleive anything he writes. It is like he didn't even try to produce a quality book, just adding another title to his list. Have you ever met someone who would lie to make friends? That is the impressinn I got from Jess Stern. Don't buy this book . It is a waste of your time and money."
2,Where are all the songs I was hearing in the movie???,"I heard some songs in the movie that were good but none of them are on the soundtrack!!! The only one that I recognize is the song by the black budda flys. I definitely can't by this! Bad decision making. Just because the cd has Ice Cube, Redman, GhostFace Etc. doesn't mean that it's good. At least make sure that the song is good. People don't always pay for the name. More than half of this cd seems to be pretty wack... I was real disappointed. I'm gonna have to rent the movie again and read the credits to find the artists who should've been on this cd."
3,"Great Movie, Average Soundtrack","the soundtrack was pretty average. the best song is ''This Aint A Game'', which is a collaboration between Lil Eazy-E and Bone Thugs N Harmony."
1,BAD,This movie was so bad that I refuse to buy the sound track. I cant believe that I am wasting my time writing this. But I really feel sorry for the people who liked the movie. I really cant believe that the producers thought that they would make enough money on this movie so sell a soundtrack. The movie was bad and I bet that the soundtrack is worse.
1,"SUCKS,SUCKS,SUCKS","This cd sucked first of all why was game not on this soundtrack there are mostly washed up rappers on here like bone thugs n harmony there just suck. and this movie was too good to have a nasty soundtrack, check out the movie not the soundtrack, i reccomend t.i., or the ice cube plus watch out for rick ross he is a problem,PEACE Y'ALL"
5,Best designed folding saw for any toolcase,"I've gone through a lot of folding saws, and this one is the best. It takes regular recip. blades that you can buy anywhere (or probably already have), and has a handy storage compartment in the handle that can store at least 3 extra blades. It folds up so it doesn't take much room in your toolcase, and doesn't accidentally cut you or your other equipment (like every drywall saw on the market does). I keep a drywall blade, wood blade and metal blade in here, and it's handy for virtually any situation. For serious or volume cutting, you still can't beat a conventional saw, but for work in tight spaces, drywall cutting or the occassional cut when you just need a quick saw, this is a great addition to any toolbox. Very convenient."
4,Not a heavy duty tool but great for a tool bag for those times when nothing else can do the job,"I purchased this for my cabinet installation bag. Its worked great so far and I like how it folds up so the blade isnt exposed. Yes, its not a heavy duty saw but it works for notching studs/blocking, cutting holes in drywall and cutting off screws/pvc pipe with the right blade. It fits in my bag so I dont need to carry along a recip saw all the time. If you need a saw to do anything more than small cuts or to get you out of a jam then keep looking, but this saw has saved me many times where I just cant fit a circular or jig saw.It only comes with one wood blade but can take any length reciprocating saw blades, I keep a couple different 6"" blades in the storage handle"
5,the best live album of the year 1996,"dio is one of the oldest and most remarkable voices of metal.along with tracy-g on guitar and ex black saabath partner vinnie appice on drums , agreat show canbe taken for granted.the track list is perfect, it didn't fail to include ""man on the silver mountain"" and ""long live rock'n roll"" from his rainbow days along with ""heaven & hell"" and ""mob rules"" from the sabbath years. Of course all his solo hits are in ,makingthis album a must have for sabbath,rainbow or simply dio fans"
2,Straight Through The Heart,"At best this is a lack luster set comprised of 5 songs from ""Holy Diver"", 4 songs from ""Angry Machines"", 2 song from ""The Last In Line"", 2 songs from the Black Sabbath era, 3 songs from the Rainbow era; of which two are arranged in a poor montage, one out of place drum solo and one guitar solo. I thought by now RJD wouldn't have to rely on Black Sabbath and Rainbow tracks to fill a show. I find Tracy G's style uninspired and going overkill on some of the tremolo/vibrato action and it is quite apparent that he cannot handle the ending riff's on ""Heaven and Hell"". I would pass on this set and save up for the RJD box set that is rumored to be coming out sometime this year."
4,Very Good Place To Start,"If you own nothing by Ronnie James Dio, this is THE place to start. First of all, he has one of the best singing voices in any genre. His delivery is superb here and the musicians that accompany him are fantastic. I would recommend this to any metal or rock fan."
2,Inferno... Butchery is more like it,"man, i cant believe i'm rating a dio album that low but it cantbe otherwise because i expected a break-neck live recording and instead... what a flop. I own this album since 1998 and havent given it a listen since then. i prefer 1000 times the original studio recordings over the pitiful performances that are litterally massacred by tracy G. , and that arrogant and utterly silly Vinnie appice who picks up the exactly same drum solo he played on the Live evil show in 1982 with Dio and the Sabs. The result is killing all the magic in the process. two stars for the nice package. the music isnt worth a lick."
1,I've been mistreated... I've been abused.,"Dear old Dio, Here are some headlines I saw about your ""Last in Live/Dio'sInferno"" album :THE voice of metal is ill It's time to killDio's worst workThey've taken him away Where is Ritchie now ?Jesus, Mary & Holy Ghost, visit Dio's site in Hell !Nobody's up there It's a deception Where have they hidden my throne ?The last in line... is dead !The ""Man On The Silver Mountain"" is Blackmore, not you here ! ""Long Live Rock And Roll""... without you, my dear Dio ! You can't call this a LIVE album ! It's a shame ! I liked you, you know : We Rocked on ""Holy Diver"", ""The last in Line"" and ""Strange Highways"", not with you on this infernal 2ble-CD of cheap junk ! You cannot petition The Lord of MY World with that sort of prayers ! BANG BANG You're dead !LUCIFER"
5,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"This movie holds a special place in my heart! (Good times!) I remember seeing this with my mom and dad when I was 6 years old back in 1996. I always loved the Looney Tunes, and seeing them team up with Michael Jordan was awesome! The Looney Tunes need Michael's help with a basketball game or they will be forced to be the new attractions at Moron Mountain. My favorite part is THE BIG GAME! which would be the last 30 minutes of the movie. I highly recommend SPACE JAM!!!"
5,Space Jam,"I purchased this DVD for my son's 15th birthday, he had not seen the movie since he was about 8 or 9 when the last video copy of this movie died. When he used to watch it he would play along with a nurf basketball and hoop. As he watched it this time he didn't play basketball, but said that he didn't remember it being so funny. He has watched it a few times since he got it mostly when his friends are over.It's a classic and the whole family have enjoyed watching is again. It's a must have for basketball fans.My son is and was a HUGH Micheal Jordon fan and LOVES basketball, it's he's favorite sport."
3,Space Jam Learning,"the movie was every funny and brings back memories, I used it for the reading mentoring program for thrid graders. They saw the DVD and wrote a review ( ALL LIKED IT)"
4,Excelente material,Un clásico para los amantes de los looney toons y el basket. Recomendado para coleccionistas. Para reirse un buen rato.
3,Sports,I bought this movie for a friend so I don't know what the movie is like. I am not interested personally in these kinds of movies. My friend rates this movie a 5-star.
3,ANSWER THE QUESTION,"Why didn't they animate Michael Jordon? He's a block of wood.Thank you.Overall, I liked the movie, but the basketball star of the film was what dragged it down. A lot of people wanted this to be a big summer block buster, but it was dragged down by a man who thought he could do everything.Too bad."
1,Space Junk,"Studio execs had just one goal in mind: combine two popular things (Looney Tunes and Micheal Jordan), no matter how disparate and unrelated they might be, and just throw them into a movie together. Heck, they've been doing it in commercials for a long time, why not a feature length film? Why indeed.Everything else about this movie from the script to the direction flowed from that inherently flawed and nonsensical choice. And from junk comes junk. Hence, Space Junk.I don't actually hate this movie quite as much as I sound, but it's high rating on Amazon really ticks me off. This really is not any good."
3,Kids loved it !!,"My kids really enjoyed watching this movie with MJ. They are really into basketball and watching this movie has made them want to get out there and ""be like Mike""."
5,Who wouldn't give this 5 stars?,one of the best movies that the 90s spit out!! i stll remember watching this as a kid. great movie!!
4,Air Jordan rules forever in basketball,"This is a great movie for kids or adults. If you're a Jordan or Bugs Bunny fan you'll enjoy this movie. Great animation and acting. How they got all those NBA players to work on this movie is beyond me, but it sure wouldn't happen today with today's greedy owners and players!"
4,Oldie but goodie,"Your little sports fan will love this. My 3-year old son watches this movie while he shoots baskets in his room. The other day he informed me, ""Mommy, Michael Jordan retired."" Priceless!"
3,Basket Ball Jones,"I think all ages could like this movie, as long as your somewhat of a basketball fan, well maybee not even that. With famous basketball star Michael Jordan of Chicago Bulls starring along with cartoon classic Bugs Bunny and Moron Mountain space critters Loony Toons go head 2 head on the b-ball court."
3,Jammed,This is an entertaining family movie but the Looney Tunes characters don't quite feel right. Maybe it's because Mel Blanc is gone but usually they are more cocky and inflappable. Michael Jordan does better than expected here.
3,space jam,this saler when they mailed my movie they put current resident .if it would have been sent to the wrong address i wouldn't have reseved it.
2,Looney Tunes should stick to anvils,"This film was a travesty. But hey- its a kids movie, right? I can't bash it too much. Still, watching it now it makes me angry at how such a horrible film can get by. If you are below the age of 10, like sports, and have never seen a REAL Bugs Bunny cartoon, you might like it. Other than that, its only saving grace is the Pulp Fiction reference with Elmer and Sam near the end- oh, and Bill Murray. Michael Jordan's appearance is solely for the sake of showing him play ball with Jock Jams playing in the background whilst the cartoon characters stand in awe. I'd rather watch Cartoon Network."
4,Gotta love those looney toons!,Michael Jordan and The Looney Toons? Whats not to like! A fun movie that the family can enjoy unless you are sensitive to a few things that you may not want to expose younger children to. 4 stars
5,Space Jam,Saw this movie went it first come out as a kid and enjoyed it then and as much as I do now. Great for laughs
4,"good movie,but","This is a good Movie,but the copy I recieved was from Australia. Therefore it would not play in my dvd player. I watched it on my computer ok."
5,Amazing Quality,At first i was a little hesitant to buy this movie because it was such an old movie and it was for a cheap price. The dvd came in four days before they said it was going to come in. It was still wrapped in original plastic and had been untouched i have now bought 2 dvds and looking to buy some more you wont regret buying them. You will want to keep buying more from Importcds
5,I would give it six stars if I good.,This is without a doubt the greatest movie about cartoon characters playing basketball with Michael Jordan that I have ever seen.
3,A surprisingly good film,"I'm not exactly the kind of audience that this movie was intended for. I'm not a basketball fan, although I do know who Michael Jordan is. For me, the biggest appeal was seeing how the cartoon characters interacted with the live-action actors.The special effects aren't up to par with, say, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", but they come pretty close. Not all the jokes work, and the first half-hour is a bit slow. But once Jordan and the toons team up, the film really hits its stride.I was surprised, because with a huge sports star like Jordan in this kind of film, I thought the emphasis would've been more on marketing and sponsorship strategies than working hard to make a decent film. Thankfully, I was wrong."
1,Family,I received the movie within a week but it wouldn't play had to return it and order it from someone else.
1,never received,"We did not receive this item. We ordered another movie and received it in a timely manner, but this one was out of stock."
1,Ok if you like basket ball.,I really am not a sports buff so this movie isin't for me allthough I do enjoy cartoons with sports as a theme. But for all of you folks who enjoy basketball or any other sport for that matter I'm not stoping you from watching this movie so go ahead and have a good time!I am also not happy about the special featueres on the 2 disc special edition DVD. In 'Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers' all the scenes with Yosemiti Sam are editied out and I wonder why. Are all youngsteres going to copy a pint sized cowboy shooting guns and smoking ETC? Also there is the special 'Bugs VS Daffy Battle of the music video stars' Where the music and the sounds are so high that one can hardly hear what Bugs or Daffy were saying.
1,An embarrassment for all concerned,"Michael Jordan has trod upon sacred ground by engaging in this blasphemously horrible movie. In his seeming quest for the all-mighty dollar (and you thought he had enough!), he out-mongers even himself by participating in this... film. The worst sin of this all is dragging the likes of Bugs Bunny down with him. A piece of advice for the wary viewer: skip this film and tune in instead to some classic Looney Toons at home."
1,The worst movie I ever saw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I wish I could get my money back from the theater because this movie sucked big time. Not only can Micheal Jordan not play basketball but he can't act either. If I could give it fewer than one star I would, as a matter of fact they me stars for this piece of trash."
1,sickening,"My daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!! This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and ""strutting her stuff"" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars."
3,"If you're a Doctor Who fan, you'll probably want this...","Ominous and scary at times and odd at others. Just like the episode. Proves that Mark knows what he's doing. Much more active than Mark's 'Greatest Show in the Galaxy' music, but I happen to prefer that one a bit more (personally). Maybe this one is a better buy since it is so much more active, but that's up to you. As a severe Doctor Who fan, I got it because I have to get them all. Maybe you do too."
2,You get what you pay for,"Thin, small, straps work poorly. I would have just gotten a 5.99$ orange monster instead to keep on the boat."
4,This tool does the job.,"I purchased this tool and put it to the test.I used this small hand saw to make my finish cuts on some siding after making the longer cuts with my trim saw.This tool worked very well installing perimitter vents on the modular homes I'm working on, it also fits right into my tool pouch.Good investment."
2,Not for leather,"I had a pair of Nike Sneakers that the rubber sole separated from the upperleather.I washed then throughly with Tide detergent and allowed them to fullydry for 2 days.I liberally applied shoe goo to both pieces to be joined.I then placed them together and taped them tight so as not to move for 24 hours.They lasted for approx 2 days before they came apart again.This stuff is notwhat its cracked up to be.I was not impressed with it.This time im going to use regular Dap contact cement,apply to both sides,allow to dry approx15 minutes and join them together.This will work much better than shoe goo.It cantbe any worse.I imagine bonding leather to rubber takes a special formula,i dont know."
5,Shoe Goo,"I received this product within a mere days after placing my order. I was also very satisfied with the product, my shoes have been holding up great!"
3,Mediocre performance,This saw is all right. It is severely out gunned by other saws though. A smaller pull saw will blow it away any day of the week. Even stanleys own short cut saw will cut circles around it.The hardened teeth do stay sharp longer than a standard saw. I guess it has some advantages. I recommend a pull saw from shark corp. They are inexpensive and perform very well.
5,Made me weep,"The title story touched me as no story has before or since. A son behaves intimately and unlawfully with his father during the days of his death. With the son we confront stupid laws and unfeeling bureaucracy and, in the end, vital community. The poignancy of the secret burial made me weep. How the son acts out his values with fidelity and grace is a story for all to learn from and be inspired. This is horror made beautiful. Berry's writing here is beyond criticism. Read this book and be renewed."
3,Solid hip hop album,"This is a solid album from Saafir, but I don't think he's strong enough to make a really strong album by himself. Saafir has a deep, broad voice and a deliberate, occasionally mechanical flow. To me he sounds like a street version of Aesop Rock, or Kam (who guests on ""watch how daddy ball"")if Kam had less flavor.Not a bad CD, but nothing exceptional either. It would be a nice addition for the collection but don't except an album worth hundreds of spins."
5,"Thought provoking, practical, and sophisticated","I am a psychotherapist who has worked extensively with children and their parents, and I am delighted to have found this wonderful book. The author presents a careful, thoughtful approach to understanding the relationship between a child's therapist and that child's parents. There are many important issues presented, some of which are obvious and commonplace and some are more subtle. It is particularly useful in reminding us that parents and therapists need the same level of careful attention as our child patients. By following the approach presented here, therapists can maintain a compassionate helpful relationship with parents while working with their children."
3,Love the pink but paint all ready chipping,I love the pink and that is the reason I purchased the product. But in a couple places all ready the pink is chiping away just from use. I guess I was expecting better quality from Cuisinart.
4,"dope cd, it's got flows and is just banging",i think that as soon as people discover this guy he'll become popular. he can rap dope and he is smooth with his lyrics. i think that la will be big one day.
4,Dope as hell,"First off, this is a dope album but not worth the ridiculous prices here on amazon, unless you're a really serious collector. Also, this album has, in my opinion, been overrated by some heads who are obssesed with rare and out of print hip hop.""Lucci"" is a great opening track, with a crazy dope third verse, while ""Now Y"" is a thugged out call to arms.Throughout the disc, La drops street knowledge and hood stories, peppering gritty narratives with occasional insight. While he is an adept emcee, there is not a tremendous amount of new material.Production is gritty, NY underground sound that fits La and fam well. ""I want it all"" is a great closing track.This is a dope album from a emcee who unfortunately became any more obscure. A great buy if you can get it for a fair price."
2,All around weak material,"Out of all the Wu spinoff groups/artists that have come up, La has to be the worst. It's a wonder how this unskilled MC even came up, or why the Wu would want to be affiliated with him. Throughout the album, he drops boring raps about crime in the city, in a bland, unappealing manner, which make the CD a chore to even listen to. On on the title cut ""Heist Of The Century"", La does spin an intruiging tale of robbing the government. As far as the beats go, there are a few head nodders, but only one track, ""Shine"", has a beat that's good enough to overcome La's lyrical impediment. Other than that, most of the production is just average. In fact, some songs sound far too commercial for the Wu, with recycled beats and lyrics about Lucci and Rolexes, and Versachi. To sum it up, Wu fans will be dissapointed by this lethargic CD."
3,If you like Wu.......go ahead,"Very promising, with a few you can nod your head to. The tracks seem like they're just repeating themselves at times, but Wu will make a star out of him in the underground."
5,performance,"Quasthoff is magical in live performance as well as on disc, even better in fact. Yes that's correct-he performs on stage and i would advise anyone who has an opportunity to hear him live to do so. PSPA or whatever his name is should know he performs live, being from Boston-he just performed Schwanengesang last year in Jordan Hall (Boston). He has also recently ventured into opera, so i don't know where that review came from. And by the way, Dieskau's ""technical perfection""? He had many things but technical perfection was not one of them. Buy this disc."
4,Love it,A very easy read book and a must read for class. After analyzing each prose the meaning is clear to their teachings. Thank you and the price was just right.
5,Great Teacher,"Not enough can be said about the way he passes the message. I wish that i can someday meet him and thank him for the way he teaches, his compassion comes through in every sentence."
1,Outward Bound Pet Gear Bag,"This product could have been quite functional except that it had a very strong ruber-tire smell which I think would have permeated anything in it or near it. I just couldn't tolerate the smell. Thus, I didn't use it. However, the shipping to return it would have been expensive enough that it wasn't worthwhile to do so, so I was stuck with it (Plus I had already had a bad experience returning something to Amazon.) I was very disappointed. It might be okay for someone less sensitive to chemical smells."
3,thief of light - 25 watt thriller,"I like the art-crime genre. This book didn't really do it for me. It has potential, but nothing really happens that makes you go WOW. Not enough art to keep me interested. The mystery aspect is only ""airport-bookstore"" quality. The characters are a little flat. Try The Rembrant Panel by Oliver Banks, It Happened In Boston by Russell Greenan, or any of the ""Ripley"" novels by Patricia Highsmith for good art/mystery books."
4,AN EDGER-SEATER,"This book held my interest all the way through. The characters were all-too-real. As a former art dealer himself, he probably patterned his characters after some he encountered, and that's frightening, but gives the book the reality punch. Looking forward to his next book."
5,Good Basic Information,"This book is actually the first edition, and the Piatkus Guides series was cancelled back in 2000. However, this book is now available as a stand-alone title ""An Introduction To Reiki"", still published by Piatkus, but obviously with a new cover. It is a good basic guide to Reiki, particularly suitable for people who don't know anything about Reiki, or who have just done their first Reiki course. Because it was written in 1998 some of the information is now a little out of date - quite a lot of new information came out of Japan in 1999 and 2000 - but it is easy to read and easy to understand, and also offers a non-judgemental view of the different approaches and viewpoints in the Reiki community. Well worth reading."
4,If you like stock car racing and soap opera relationships - you'll enjoy Fast Track,"Series about stock car racing and fictious Eagle Ridge Racing. Originally produced for an American cable channel and filmed in Canada, the series follows former race car driver turned doctor Richard Beckett (Keith Carradine), who returns to Eagle Ridge Racing as chief medic. Beckett finds himself competing with old rival race track owner Christian Chandler (Duncan Regehr) over an old flame who happens to be Chandler's ex-wife. Bottom line, fun to see behind the scenes stock car racing and lots of soap opera relationships. As another reviewer stated, the series originally had 23 episodes, although this set only has 22 episodes. Only one season was filmed. Some nudity and adult content."
1,My Little Pony,"I wanted to like this book. Kate Hill has created a refreshing world, or one that would be refreshing if the writing wasn't so stilted and childish.I was hoping for some erotica as promised in the description. There's sex, but it is clumsy and not arrousing. Hill has tried and failed at creating the necessary tension between lovers. Again, that is because of the writing.The plot is pretty straightforward, but there is really very little for the protagonist to struggle against. It's an unfair fight where one is completely assured he will win.The characters are likeable and diverse, but you get only the slightest outline of them.This book could have been lush and fresh. In the end, it felt like it was written by a teenager who was caught between My Little Pony and her emerging hormones."
1,Don't waste time,This book was not fun. If u want sex u got it but if u want a plot... Find another book
3,Second review,"This is the second time I've received an email to review this product and this company. As I said before I paid extra to have this product shipped in 3 days and it took more than a week to receive it. By the time I received it, it was too late. The company gave me a $4 refund, but gave the credit to an account that was closed so I really have received nothing. Then they sent me an email asking that I give them a favorable review, which I never did because I'm still disgusted with their service. As much as I trust Amazon, I'll never order from this particular company again."
4,Favorite Old Record,"This album is not for everyone, but if you really enjoy ska it's great. The singer has a higher-pitched voice and some of the songs have drug content, which could be a down-side, it's up to you, but if you want something peppy to listen to, this is just fine."
3,You'll get tired of this cd...,"Although DHC are extremely talented musicians, I wouldn't buy any more of their cd's. I barrowed Lockjaw from a friend and loved it but when I bought it myself it became annoying and tiresome. Every now and again I pull it out to listen to, but halfway through the second song I have to take it out again. They're good but the songs song alike...number 5 and 11 are very good though."
1,no...,"I won't get into a negative review like I'd do for the Backstreet Boys or *N'Sync, but still, DHC isn't what you'd call a good punk band (in my opinion). I admit, I like Buck-O-Nine. I like Green Day. And believe it or not, I LOVE Rancid! I've even started wearing a Tim Armstrong-like mowhawk! But as for the Dance Hall Crashers, no. The song ""Sticky"" has the strangest lyrics (""Take the knife out of my back/clean the blade and put it back""). even a Slayer fan like me finds that weird, probably because it's being sung by a chick. The 2 girls definetly aren't fun to look at either. They're both extremely pail with dark red lipstick. Real female punk is Joan Jett, The Donnas, Patti Smith, you know, singing about rock & roll and boys and pissing and stuff and not songs about other girls with mental problems. To me, DHC's style has nothing to do with real punk. Now, since I like punk, even ska punk, I hope DHC sells well, but I wouldn't bother buying one of their albums."
4,Best Soundtrack for the Two of the Best Films Ever Made,"When I first listened to this CD, I re-experienced everything that I saw when I watched ""Re-Animator"" and ""Bride of Re-Animator"": the smiles, the faces, the...zombies. I like this CD for it has some of the best tracks ever made for a ""B"" horror film."
3,Worth a read,"This is an interesting, if long-winded, account of the events leading up to Gough Whitlan's election as Australian prime minister--and his subsequent dismissal from office. Written by his former press secretary and close adviser/friend, it is extremely sympathetic to Whitlam and his strong socialist agenda.Its major weakness is that it fails to explore, much less describe in detail, the chief reason for the Labor Party's great schism, namely, the Communist takeover of so many unions and its influence in the Labor Party. end review"
3,"OK, but rushed","This book was OK, but only about 75 pages. Almost like a summary or a condensed book. Definitely would have liked to see it be at least twice as long, and explain some more of what happened in the alternate history."
1,Apparently these people never heard the original.,This cd is horrible. The original Mousercise was actually about giving children easy movements to do. It was like kids jazzercize and they loved it. This one is more like regular Disney songs put to club music. They should have just re-released the originals.
1,Disappointed - Sounds just like every other Disney CD.,"I agree with the former reviewer. I have fond memories of dancing to Mickey's Mousercise as a child. Half of the fun was following the charted choreography included with the album. (Mine was a record.:)) I teach preschool now and was SO excited to see this listed as a CD release. . . until I saw the song list and listened to them. What is ""Part of Your World"" doing on an ""exercise"" album? This CD has a few of the classic songs: Ducks Dance Too, I Wanna Be Like You. But the name is misleading. It's just another hopped-up re-release of Disney songs mostly. Where are the fun, choreographed songs like ""Bug-A-Boo,"" and ""Get the Money?"" I am SO DISAPPOINTED!!!"
1,not the real deal,"My daughter was very disappointed. This was not an authentic redo of the original. Should have sent it back, but as usual, kept it."
3,Not a DVD,"Songs are cute. Kids will like it. It's a CD not a DVD, so no visual for the kids to follow. It's up to you to create something-but that's not a bad thing....."
1,dissapointed,"I was really disappointed when I heard the music for this CD. It was all new age b-bop, I was expecting it to be like the old mousercise that I grew up with where you could actually understand what they are saying and what excercise you are suppose to do. Instead the voices are covered up by Brittney SPears type music-boo!"
2,A bit disappointed,I was hoping for the original Disney lyrics but found only a few of the original tunes on this CD. Too Bad!
2,Why not release original?,"I still dance to this music, my favorite is not included in the new album ""Get the money, Uncle Scrooge's money"". The sound quality on my cassette is fading, I really wished Disney would have put the original on CD not just for me but for the new generation to hear."
2,No sweat,"Stripilates isn't much for a 50 minute ""workout"". It is probably fine for a beginner looking for variety. This dvd is good if you are looking for a relaxing 50 minute exercise routine. If you are looking to break a sweat and get a good workout, go for Lara Hudson 10 minute piliates or yoga dvd."
1,Sent in envelope- damaged and unusable,"This company has no clue how to pack things. This very expensive photo album was packed in a padded envelope and arrived with the top right hand corner bent back, as well as every single photo page. With Amazon's help, I returned it and instead of a replacement that I asked for to be shipped in a box, they returned my money, so now I have to start all over again. Customer service is not their strong point, for sure."
1,For Hikers Only,"I own and use several Lonely Planet Guides. I have come to trust these books as thorough, authoritative and helpful in planning and implementing trips. The Banff, Jasper & Glacier National Parks book is an exception and meets none of these criteria unless you sole focus is hiking. This book is for hikers and has little information for others. Furthermore, of the 280 pages of actual information, only 57 pages are devoted to Glacier National Park. Information concerning lodging, restaurants and other activities such as cycling is sparse. The few maps that are included detail mainly hiking trails. If this book had been titled A Hikers Guide, I would highly recommended it."
2,Somewhat Dissapointing,"I ordered several books on arboriculture from Amazon Recently. I anticipated the arrival of The Illustrated Guide to Pruning more than any other. I felt that 300+ pages of pictures and explanations on pruning would serve as an exhaustive reference that I could use to fill in the knowledge gaps. I read the book in the course of a week. It was OK. There is LOTS of repetition. There was no a-ha moments...Arboricuture 4th edition by Harris, Clark, and Matheny touch on pruning as only a part of their excellent book. They are succinct in what they say and are able to transfer as much good information in less than 50 pages."
5,terrific pruning manual,"This book seems to be written as a classroom instruction manual. As such, it is very comprehensive. I've got several pruning books, but this one is by far the best at providing instruction you can really go out and implement in your yard."
1,God Help Us,"This has got to be one of THE WORST singles of the year. This is perhaps the most wretched, wretched, song since ""What is love?"" by Haddaway. At first I thought this was a joke, I didn't think anyone would actually write lyrics as horribly mangled and cliched as these. The musicianship is below mediocre, which only decreases the quality of this song exponentially. Do yourself a favor, and do everything in your power to protect your ears from this song, above all else, don't buy it."
2,Poor information,I feel this book is filled with inaccuracies and incorrect information. Unfortunate that so many things are wrong in the information presented.
2,Oldie,"This book lists several trails that are no longer available to public. It's about 10 years old, which may explain the mistakes since the area has changed so much in the last decade. Also, the directions are poor, which can be dangerous. One hike took several hours longer because mileage was underestimated. . ."
4,The Boarhog is at it again!,"The only reason I didn't give this Larry McCray CD 5 stars is that I am intimately familiar with his earlier efforts and this material is just a tad wanting compared to them. Make no mistake about it, this is top-shelf electric blues with all of the ingredients Larry is known for cookin' up. The vocals here are from deep within this barrel-chested road-hardended vet. Larry croons with so much soul and heart, you may forget he is also the guitar burner here....you may but it's doubtful. Larry's lead work and arrangements are awesome as usual. Great for the musician and ""joe listener"" alike this music is layered with busy grooves & stops, background vocals, and funky bass lines, all supporting McCray's searing but juicy-toned licks, which he never seems to run out of. This disc was recorded with Larry's road-tight band and it shows. When you hear ""Believe It"" you will see why Larry McCray says ""Blues is my business, and business is good"". JBE"
4,rockin blues,"this cd can be filed under rock more then blues,but larry still plays hot licks. if you enjoy solo""s more then anything this show larry can play his guitar. if you like eric gale to kenny wayne shepard this cd is for you"
3,O K,C/D was exactly what I paid for however the first tract skips on e different cd palyers... however the rest of it was very good
3,Not his Best,"Larry McCray is an exceptional guitarist that blends rock and blues. This particular CD seems underproduced and the songs are average, but Larry's guitar playing still stands out. His previous CD, Born to Play the Blues was exceptional and makes this current release seem even more lackluster."
4,"For this price, it can't get any better...","I brought this watch mainly for everyday use, since I already got a couple nice expensive watchs for special occasions. However, i still wanted a watch where if i accidentally smash it or break it, i wouldn't feel bad about it. And this watch fits right in for that role, beside with the current price of less that $60, and it's one of the top brand, so I trust it will last me a while.The watch itself is very nice, made of stainless steel (so you don't have to worry too much of scratching it)and it is water resistance (i actually tried once, wearing this watch to my friend's indoor pool party, and it works pretty good), and so far i had this watch like over 3 months now, and it still works... so, no complaint here! (Oh yeah, please excuse my bad grammar!)"
3,Not up to snuff,"I am a big James Hall fan and think he is the best of the Florida mystery/detective writers. In a league with Connelly, Crais and Lahane. This is a book searching for an idea. Half way through for the first time ever I thought I might have to put down a Hall book. It picked up then but there were just too many gaps. Where did they get a seaplane? How did it land so close without detection? How much punishment can Thorn take? Why is Thorn so contrary when he evidently leads a charmed life. I'll read more but hopefully there will be a return to form."
3,a good read,"James W. Hall was unfamiliar to me when I read this book. It was an interesting read and a little unusual but it is certainly worth reading. The plot is enjoyable and you get caught up in the story and want it to end according to your plan.Would be happy to read other books by this author because he knows how to write.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Little mystery, minimal action but still enjoyable Kindle book.","Before going to Key West last week, I asked at the Amazon forum for suggestions of books set near there, and Hall's series came up.This is the first and only book of his that have read. It was an entertaining tale about a mysterious EMP device which triggered an airplane crash that kicks off the story.I did not find that there was any mystery here, and, frankly, little action. Nonetheless, it entertained me with the Key Largo setting, and that was sufficient. However, in comparison to the other action novelists that I read, this was weak stuff. I have another of his books on my Kindle which I will read when I return to Southern Florida (to visit my dad).The Kindle ediiton was fine with no significant typos or formatting issues."
5,so good! but not 100% whole wheat...,"Despite the fact it's not 100% whole wheat (it's got some semolina mixed in), this is a DELICIOUS pasta. This is probably one of the few pastas I could eat directly from the pot, without sauce or seasoning (not that I would, but I don't mind testing it while it's cooking....) It reminds me a lot of the fresh egg noodles I ate as a kid at huge family dinners.Doesn't disintegrate or get gluey, and doesn't get that weird bitter or nutty flavor some whole wheat pastas take on. Cooks VERY tender and not sticky. Lovely with all sorts of sauces, and we also just toss it with a little oil and some veggies.This pasta is great."
3,Okay,"My son is 4 years old and I purchased this book to help him with his handwritting. I think that this is a very good book for training, but he was really bored with is after a while, he was doing like ten pages at a time and looking at me like ""Mom...why are you giving me this""! LOL I think it's more for the 2 or 3 years olds."
1,sad to see it was wrote in,got this for my son and he said mama some one did it already:(... he was not happy and to be truthful i was not eaither
4,great for fine motor,"I also purchased this book for my 3 year old son. Although his favorite book is the cutting and pasting book, this one gets a pencil in his hand and helps him start making lines and swirls as if to form letters. I use page protectors and dry erase pens over each page, so he can erase and try again as many times as he likes without marking the book up. I'm really happy with how Kumon identifies the need to develop fine motor skills in order to teach printing. This book begins with small exercises that all work together so that by the time they are making ""letters"" kids use proper technique and have confidence in their abilities."
5,Great fun for little ones,"I bought the Kumon Easy Mazes workbook for my 3 year old and she LOVED it so much I have returned to buy pretty much ALL of the other Kumon workbooks that are age appropriate. This one is too easy for her, we skipped the first third of the workbook because it really was intended to be completed before the Easy Mazes book, but she still thinks it is a lot of fun, and it does cover a concept or two (like drawing loops that cross over themselves) that the Easy Mazes doesn't, so I'm not disappointed at all. She isn't very interested in drawing or coloring so it surprises me how much she loves these workbooks. For the price they do get used up fairly quickly, but unlike coloring books you are forced to stay involved and present so you are really paying for the no-excuses quality time too."
4,Best Shoes Ever,These are my favorite shoes. Unfortunately they are not making them anymore that is why I only gave them 4 star. I have owned a pair of these shoes before and bought this pair because of them not making this style anymore.
5,Wonderful walking shoes.,"I recently ordered my second pair of these shoes. They arrived very quickly and I am quite pleased with them. They fit well (with long, narrow feet, I often have difficulty finding the proper size), are lightweight, and very comfortable. I walk several days/week and am involved in voluteer activities which require a lot of standing and moving about. These are the best shoes I have ever found which can get me through the day without my feet and legs feeling fatigued."
1,Shoe were not sized right,After trying two different pair of same size 7 neither fit my foot.Had to return items to seller. Last time had to pick up freightcharges. Didn't feel that was right. Have an older pair of Rykashoes and never had this problem before.
1,Ryka Women's Radiant Walking Shoe,"This was my first purchase of a Ryka shoe since the inception of the brand. This model had good reviews, so I gave it a try. As soon as I put the shoe on, and stepped on the carpet, I felt immediate pain in the toe box area. The shoe material was very irritating, causing a lot of friction despite my wearing cotton socks. The entire shoe felt horrible. I'm not sure if it was a defective shoe or just the style. I have chronic, ingrown toenails; so I need shoes with a roomy toe box area. I also wear orthotics. I was unable to determine if this shoe accommodated orthotics, as I would have had to tear out the glued-in innersoles. If you need a roomy toe box, this shoe is not for you. As for me, I'll stick to Brooks and New Balance walking shoes."
2,NOT COMFORTABLE,"THESE SHOES WERE MADE OUT TO BE THE VERY BEST WALKING SHOES , THEY ARE NOT COMFORTABLE ... will not buy no more shoes on line with out trying on .. coast to much to send back"
5,So comfy!,"These sneakers are my favorite yet. They mold perfectly to my feet. They're my first pair of Ryka's, & I'm a convert. I use them at the gym, for walking, & for everyday running around, & they can't be beat. Pretty cute, too, for a fitness sneaker."
2,Sizing off,Sizing off by 1/2 size. Will not buy again. Gave toi granddaughter since she wears a 6 1/2. Not worth the hassel of returning.
4,Love this brand!,"I would have chosen 5 stars if the shoe had more leather, we'll see how the mesh holds up. It's my first shoe with mesh as opposed to all leather. I have purchased other Ryka shoes in different models and i love their fit and support which is why i chose them here and also a really great price. The fit is true to size and the heel support is really nice. I do different types of workouts mostly low impact aerobics and walking so I was in need of a shoe that could handle different workouts. I am looking forward to trying another model of Ryka's since I got such a great price on my Radiant's!"
5,Editor's Choice,This inaugural issue of the Lady's Circle Editor's Choice Patchwork Quilts was printed in 1980 and Lady's Circle continued issuing Editor's Choice books for many years. Useful information and beautiful designs are included in this book.
3,This book is not exclusively about thrift shopping.,"I quote from A Note From the Editor: ""Originally CHEAPDATE was basically about second hand clothes, but anti-fashion,anti-'lifestyle' and alternative consumer concepts followed soon after, and finally it became a big up-yours to something intangible but there."" This is an optimistic way of saying that the book contained disappointingly little on ""charity shopping,"" focusing more strongly on quirky things, like an interview with a blackjack player and a cartoon penis saying what it likes regarding women (what types of shoes, etc). And, judging from the poor-quality, black-and-white photos, the scant material the book does contain relating to so-called anti-fashion is a disgrace to thrift shops. With a few exceptions, it appears not to be anti-fashion, but in fact a bunch of pathetic attempts at fashion. That said, the book's crude, tongue-in-cheek articles are at times humorous."
4,Betty Cody is an important country singer,"This CD contains has several of Betty Cody's songs with Lone Pine, but most of them are her individual songs of the 1950's.There are the answer songs, such as ""Please Throw Away the Glass"" (an answer to Webb Pierce's ""There Stands the Glass"" , the jaunty ones such as ""I'm Talkin', Start Walkin'"" and ""Keep your Shirt on, John."" and the weepers like ""O Mama Come Home"".Her ""Tom-Tom Yodel"" is included here and is a delight.Betty was a rival to Kitty Wells in the early 1950's and could have been a major country star, but she decided to retire instead of continuing on the road."
5,A very logical structure to what seems a complex topic,"Modern students who struggle with essay writing tasks now have a resource to introduce them to each level of the composition process, breaking down a seemingly difficult task into a series of manageable, easy steps. From an overview of seven common rhetorical modes with examples from real student essays - both rough drafts and final forms - to essay plans and different style choices, The Easy Essay Handbook: A Writing Guide For Today's Students provides a very logical structure to what seems a complex topic."
2,Plastic Model Skycrane CH54A,"This is an older plastic model so I wasn't expecting too much, it's a very basic model but the plastic is very soft to work with so don't sand it too much other than that it will look ok once finished"
3,So musch useless jung,"There is so much trivial stuff and useless junk in this book, footnotes are larger than the main text. You lost your way and can't grasp the meaning Jung has to offer. Also you must be a fully loaded intellectual to get a whole paragraph without saying ""Who/what the heck is this"" which I don't think is a downside. In my opinion there are such valuable parts in this book but only for the experienced Jung reader otherwise it is a swamp because he is showing off his talents and knowledge. You have to use the smallest fork instead of a big shovel."
4,Great stuff!,"I love this album... highly recommend it! It's a really beautiful and deep style to the Norse myths and the nine worlds. The little clips above don't do the songs justice, they dont let you listen to the best parts of the songs in my opinion.My favorite songs are definitely Midgard, Muspelheim, and also Ginnugagap although I hate that one part that sounds like video game music, I have no idea why they put that there! Vanaheim and Niflheim are also great tracks.I don't like Helheim, Ljusalfheim or Asgard as much, but that's just me."
5,Spell-binding,"I have every CD by Theroin since they went to their new style. I think that this CD is my favorite. I have been doing research on Nordic history to write my latest novel ""Sunstone"". It is the perfect music to write by. The music has drama, the words set my immagination flowing. I am a big Theroin fan and love all their music. I didn't think they could be any better but ""Secrets of the Runes"" proved that they can out-do themselves."
2,This sure is not the same Therion that I remember,"I've made many attempts to listen to this, but I just do not like it. I do not understand how the reviewer below me can call this metal.This is definitely not metal. Perhaps they should release albums like this under a different name."
5,Perfectly Perfect,What can you say about Therion ?? .... they are a legendary Death Metal band ... I listen usually to symphonies and Opera & i never thought that death metal is an art untill i listened to ( Raise of Sodom and Gomorrah ) by Therion ... then my life changed ... i became a big fan ... i have 6 albums and this one is the last .... they are treasure for anyone like the labile melody which continously change in harmony with great inspiration ... their music combine the opera style with great voices & greate performance with Guitar ... you cannot belive how these people can combine 2 different things without conflict between the two ... it is really worth the try ... try their music ... you won't regret it ... i myself as a cartoonist cannot draw or imagie superheroes or villains without listening to their music first.
4,A fascinating look into jazz's adolescence,"Max Kaminsky's life brought him into contact with most of the greats of pre-War jazz, and the book tells the story with verve and sparkle. It is nearly as entertaining as Eddie Condon's 'We Called It Music' and probably significantly more factual! To be read alongside that classic (and 'Eddie Condon's Treasury of Jazz') by anyone who's a fan of Bix, Armstrong, Goodman, Fats Waller, Billie Holiday and the rest of 'that crowd'."
5,First book from a UN legend,"Fasulo became one of the biggest authorities on the United Nations---she eventually became the go-to UN expert for NPR, NBC, USA Today, US News & World Report, etc.---, and it is interesting to see her perspective here at an early point in her career. Lots of interesting anecdotes from then important, and some still important, international personalities."
5,A great value,I use this with my Nikon d70s and a Gorillapod SLR. It's very sturdy and easily holds up an 18-200mm VR.
4,Good dance CD,"This is a good dance CD. The song ""Is it Love?"" is really good. It has a catchy tune and a good beat to it. There are four mixes of this song on this single. The first one is the radio version of the song. This is the best version of this song on the CD. The second version of the song is a longer dance version. The third version is a much different mix. The music has been modified slightly, but it is still likable. The fourth version is the dance version of the third one. The vocals are nearly lost in this version, so it is not that great. The last song on the CD is ""Take Me To The Disco."" The music is ok, but it it quite repetitive, and the lyrics are pretty lame. Overall, I'd get it if you have heard the song ""Is it love?"" and like it very much. If not, you should preview it before getting this, unless you can find it for little or no money."
4,"Outstanding, but I want seconds!","After listening to this CD multiple times, the only thing I'd really like is - more! There is strangely a good bit of silence on the CD (strangely enough at the beginning of a few louder, quicker tracks) , and it sometimes feels as if they're cutting themselves short on the song - keep the jam going! Since Parliament/Funkadelic lead keyboardist Bernie Worrel is pounding organ on these songs, I'm sure the jams could've gone on longer with a little bit more solos from that master of Funk..."
3,Quirky + Charming + Weird,"when this first came out, it was interesting and unique and different. but to me, it has not held up very well over time. there are some pretty cool songs on here, but the nonsense lyrics tend to make it very gimmicky and Cibo Matto always seemed to me as more of a novelty item than a functioning musical unit. a curse that this band never seemed to escape. but they can be charming and i found myself warming up more to their later releases after this one."
2,I just don't understand this cd???,This cd is so weird. What kind of music is this? And the lyrics...it's as if they freestyled and still weren't able to make any sense.
2,good for one song,"I know the song Sugar Water from Buffy and was hoping the others would be along the same lines. To put it nicely, they did not fit my tastes."
1,Yuk!,"I was not entertained by this music...Accents are so pathetic, they should stick to Japanese - only exaggerates stereotypes of weird Japanese musicians"
5,"good cd to start the day...aw, now im hungry","these girls rock, and this cd deserves all the attention its gotten. this stuff is inspired, these paeans to edibles are truly heart-felt and not the product of hipster irony. also note that its produced by mitchell froom and tchad blake. you guys might want to check out soul coughing and the latin playboys. thats all for now, kids."
5,Heaven on earth at first listen.,"This band is one of my favorites! I wish I saw them in concert. Not just about food, the music seductively leads the listener on a lyrical trip on relationships. For musicians, they're style should be a road more traveled. If you liked this CD, you'll love Stereo*Type A."
4,Excellent and fun.,"This is a great first album, it has a lot of energy behind the music and its very catchy and well done. Big kudos out to those two cute girlies we all know and love!"
3,Still pleasin the fans,"e-40 keeps up with good work with a tight album. 'behind gates' with ice cube is hot and so is 'nah, nah' with nate dogg. i recommed dis album to all e-40 fans"
3,I was somewhat disappointed with the Sunbeam Soft ...,"I was somewhat disappointed with the Sunbeam Soft Touch Heating Pad. I found it too big and clumsy. While they claim it's """"extra thick and soft for improved comfort"""" I had a hard time keeping it in place on my neck and shoulder. Regarding the Auto-Off control, the design is great, however, the heat indicator changes automatically if my position changed or I accidentally moved. I wouldn't recommend this product unless one is suffering from a back problem. For that, it'd be perfect."
5,Revenge Review,CD in excellent condition. Had a problem getting it on Ebay. Worth the price due to it's unavailability in the US Market.
4,Dangerous Skies the book that got me going,"I gave Dangerous Skies four stars because sometimes it doesn't have enough excitment, like when thier talking back and forth. The other parts are great, like when Buck had to find out who did the murder Rowlen or Tunes. It seems like sherif did it for a while, in my opinion. I think you will like the book Dangerous Skies because you can't put the book down, I started the book and I didn't want to stop. I haven't read any other boks bt Suzanne Staples."
4,Dangerous Skies,"I liked the writing and description. The author madethecharacters have a southern dialogue that is realistic. I thinkthat the beginning is dull but I kept on reading. The ending isn't as good as I think the author could write it... This story is about an african american 13-year old girl named Tunes. She lives in a small home with her father who works for Tune's best friend Buck Smith's dad. She is accused of murdering an hispanic worker, Jorge, who works for Jumbo Rawling s, a man who is well know in the conmunity. I think this taught me how racist people can be. I liked to read this book and that is why I gave it 4 stars."
4,Awesome Book,"Dear readers, This book is awesome!I liked this book because it teaches you a lesson to be kind to one another.The charactor Mr. Rawlin is as mean as he can be! He wasn`t ever really kind to his wife or anyone he met. That is why no one likes him!Buck and Tunes were the best charactors in the whole book! They lived in a tree for one or even two days including one night!!!"
3,Good Book,"I like this book very much. It shows the innocence of children while showing the reality of society. This book isn't the kind of book with a corny ending that dosn't satisfy anybody and I really like it. I must admit though the author could have done a better job writing the story. The beginning was kind of dull, but read it anyway."
4,Dangerous Skies,"I thought that the book Dangerous Skies was a decent book. The author had twists and turns that made you keep reading. This book had me on the edge of my seat in tight situations. I especially like the character Jumbo Rawlin. In ""Dangerous Skies"" this man was an absolute bad guy. I gave this book 4 stars because it is very suspenseful but it also has a lot of boring dialogue. Over all I enjoyed reading this book."
2,Friends,Dangerous Skies is a story that is mainly about two boys that live in the middle of the 1700&#65533;s. One of the friends is white and the other one is black so they have a lot of disagreements and they spend much of the story trying to figure things out. One of the people lives on a farm and does a lot of work on it. The other one is black so they get a lot of discrimination and stuff like that. I do not really like this book because it was really boring and it had no point. If you want to fine out what happens in the end you should read the book.
2,no lemon taste,"There was no llist of ingredients. I thought that was a requirment for the US.As you can see the bottle is only 3/4 full, and I cannot taste any lemon. It tasteslike garlic powder with pepper. At least it didn't contain salt."
1,Decieving,"First, I was expecting that they would fill it up to the top, but apparently they filled it 1/3 all the way up.Shipping also cost about 3.50. about the same price as the product. Another complaint is that it's mostly filled with GARLIC!, and barely any lemon peels. Once you open the container, it smell dramatically like garlic powder, no lemon scent at all!!! Your basically buying garlic powder. I felt conned.. =("
5,My grown children were delighted!,These are the old-fashioned Christmas cartoons that my grown sons loved when they were little. We have purchased a machine that converts videos into dvd's and it converted beautifully.
3,Good Comp,"Good compilation, especially for the time it came out. It features acts from The Regime, Paraphernalia to the Mob, B-Legit and Mac Dre. The album is entirely produced by One Drop Scott, who has a similar style to Tone Capone but less mobbish and more dark. If you're a fan of One Drop, this is a must have."
3,Rory Gallagher - Take It Easy Baby - Springboard records.,Rory Gallagher - Take It Easy Baby - Springboard records.This LP was released in the mid-70s but originates from 1967 studio sessions for TASTE.Tracks are:- Wee wee baby- How many more years- Take it easy baby- You've got to pay- Worried man- Norman invasion- Pardon me mister
5,"Marvelous, just marvelous","There's no need for italics when playing Beethoven. The music will speak for itself just fine, and that's just the approach Talich has chosen. These guys are as good, technically speaking, as anybody but what stands out is how unassuming they are. None of that ""look Ma, see how fast I can play"" that we get from the Emersons. Anyway, this is the set for you. Yes, I've heard others -- Italiano, Budapest, Guarneri, and Tokyo -- and the Talich has them beat across the full cycle of 16."
5,Only the best,"The Talich quartet offers us music which is moving, sensitive and warm. The quartets of Beethoven in all their majesty...The box of seven CDs is hailed by all music critics, and justly so!A booklet briefly presents each work: history, influence and composition.Here is a collection not to miss..."
2,Get the Quartetto Italiano set instead,"This guys play Beethoven in a extremely relaxed, lyrical manner, very similar to how the Quartetto Italiano plays. Except that their touch is light and with barely any warmth, a complete opposite of the old school style of the Quartetto Italiano with lots of warmth and weight. The end result is that this is the most shallow, boring Beethoven quartet set I have ever heard; all the drama, fire and passion I expect from Beethoven's music is missing hear. The Quartetto Italiano plays relaxed but never without any fire in their music, and never boring. So I am not sure why some of the guys here rate this set so highly; perhaps they play this set by their bedside to accompany their sleep?"
3,Satisfied but disappointed,"Still Got the Blues contains one of the best guitar solo's of all time and what did they do on this CD? They CUT IT OFF! How could a record company, and more importantly, how could Gary Moore allow this to happen! A major disappointment on an otherwise fine CD."
4,Good - Blues & Ballads may be a better,"Many great tracks: Empty Rooms, Cold Day in Hell (tons of energy), Free's Wishing Well (great to hear after all these years), Still Got the Blues. I prefer the Thin Lizzy (Brian Robertson/Scott Gorham) version of Still in Love with You -- it is hard to beat perfection, but it is good to hear that song again (soulful slow blues). Parisienne Walkways show-cases Gary's remarkable near infinite sustain (Les Paul and lots of gain through a Marshall amp), and this live version seems to sustain forever -- a Gary Moore classic! Great to hear the late, great Phil Lynott's voice too. However, the collection doesn't seem to hang together as well as I had hoped. I think Blues and Ballads might be a more coherent compilation of similar material."
5,Excellent compilation of Moore's solo work...,"This is an excellent overview of Gary Moore's solo work. No, it isn't complete-that would take 3 discs minimum. This album has more of Moore's hard rock material rather than his great blues playing. Gary Moore has always been one of the most underrated guitarists around. He gets credit for playing the blues, but he has always been a great rock guitarist - some of Thin Lizzy's best stuff is with Moore on guitar.Every song on this album has strong playing, but some favorites are: Out In The Fields, Over The Hills, Empty Rooms, Still Got The Blues and Parisienne Walkways(this soloing is jaw dropping).If you are a fan of great guitarists - this is a must have, or anything by Mr. Moore, he truly can make the guitar ""talk""."
5,"Superb, a great collection from a great Artist !!!!!","From Gary's early days with Coliseum and Thin Lizzy, he has been a major guitar hero for many and his own emergence with G-Force in 1980, heralded the start of a series of excellent albums. This album is indeed an excellent representative collection of his songs and reflects the sheer power of the man; consider the almost Punklike power of ""Out in the Fields"" and compare it with the overtly Celtic strains of ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" and the almost melancholy haunting tones of ""Parissienne Walkways"". The diversity of the music, the inherent feeling with which it is played and the clarity of his playing technique all contribute to a musical experience which is quite superior.This album is indeed a tribute to both Gary and his work and as previously stated is a must for anyone who appreciates guitar playing of this calibre.Roll on the next collection Gary !!!!!!"
1,very unhappy,i want to return this product and finally got a return authorization number but the vendor will not answer my question before i return it. Have tried atleast 2-3 times in email for a response but i keep getting the same email with the return #. Don't want to spend the time and money if i am not sure I will get credit for my return item.
2,CHEAP COMPILATION,"compilations are a joke. Gary has recorded an infinite number of albuns covering different styles of muscis. THen the record company takes a bunch of fifteen of them and say they are the best. ""READY FOR LOVE"" one of the very best??! You must be joking. ""STILL GOT THE BLUES"" with a shortened version ??!!! Forget it"
1,"Out In The ""Left"" Fields","Hey - Gary Moore! Damn, you got some real war connections with your music! Most of the songs on this album relate to battle type stuff - which really does nothing for me. Please don't get the wrong idea, I'm sure that it's tough being Irish and dealing with the country's religious / political strife. It just doesn't create appealing music to me.There ARE a few good songs on this album: Empty Rooms, Wishing Well and Ready For Love are all good tracks. The rest of this album is largely forgetable. Save your money and get this one at a used CD store or garage sale."
4,A Marvelous Requiem,"I bought the album for the Requiem, and was not disappointed. These guys deliver, and they approach the music in the proper respectful way. The key to Baroque performance is not in imparting one's own emotion to it, it is in reining in one's own emotion and executing the music precisely."
2,Use at your own RISK!,"These tablets work & work very good, but the problem is my wife broke out all over the stomach area with an allergic reaction to them. 3 days after she stopped taking them, the rash went away. Tried them again & it was back in full force. You are better off Buying any of these Herbals from a Pharmacy where you can return products! This company claims 100% Satisfaction,,,TOTALLY WRONG! They don't refund ANY OPENED PRODUCTS. How can you check them out if not opened. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM THIS COMPANY!"
2,Meh,did not curb my cravings for alcohol. but that may be due to my serious emotional and psychological issues that drive me to self-medicate with alcohol.....cheers
1,no effect,"I believed this would reduce alcohol intake...naah, just a placeboDidnt really believe something from a plant could be powerful, maybe a higher dosage is needed"
1,waste of money,my doctor does not want me to take these with metformin. i was informed there was not enough research concerning this product and told to avoid it.
2,The Bold Statement..,"I have to make is that I understand. I am not understanding of why this is reccommendEd(CAn a racist person keep this to themselves?) though. Yes this is thought of as National socialist Black MetAl. The Extra stAr is BecaUse a Person Can Change, and Is the Victim, saVe whEn tHeir Alone, Of thEir CircUmStaNcEs.Someone once said the racist beliefs were not in this Music, that he kept them seperAte.He aLso Liked Dead Can Dance. Not a Racist Band. Perhaps a lIsten will garner a better rEview. HE's also not alive to defend himself."
2,Hmmmmm,"Black metal is my favorite genre now. But this is just not good at all. There are a few interesting moments but you hear the first 20 seconds of a song and I'm serious thats the entire song. You dont need to hear anymore, buy if you want."
4,Black Metal,"Varg Vikernes is an absolute psychopath, a racist, and a murder; but he crafted some amazing music. 'Aske' is among the pinnacle records second generation black metal (though not nearly as impressive as the likes of Darkthrone). Fans of black metal should, well, already own this album."
4,"Splended, in-depth Burzum review.",Great album. Although I do like to attribute Mr. Vikernes' screams to his bursting of a hemorrhoid. Just think about that and you'll laugh every time.
5,Burzum/Aske,"Great album if you are into good black metal with a real artist. Don't confuse this with Dimmu Borgir or Cradle of Filth, because it sounds nothing like it."
4,Just an adaptor,"I have seen far worse adapters then these, and also far cheaper ones too(unfortunetely these were in South America, so I cannot get them anymore)these even though chinese, seem solid. Both ends fit ok, do not wobble or are loose. Delivery OK, no problems."
1,Was I sent the wrong adapter plugs?,"I ordered two of these for our trip to New Zealand and Australia. The adapter itself fit into the outlets there, but my USA hair dryer and curling iron would not fit into the adapter. The ones I ordered do not look exactly like this photo, either. The number on it is 41-13619. I didn't know I had the wrong adapters until I arrived in New Zealand. I had to wind up buying a new hair dryer there. Most USA cords have one prong longer than the other. There is no way that longer prong would fit in these adapters. My shipping was more than the cost of the adapters, and I'm not going back, so I didn't bother trying to return them."
3,Well i dont agree with the other reviewers,"Well, i am re-writting my review of this cd after i gave it a couple more spins. I like Jack Bruce's more experimental work (like what he did with don cherry and carla bley) and some of his duos, and other recent stuff too. So, since this had carla Bley in this particular band, i thought things would go (at least a bit) down that road. But the playing is actually lame in some parts, and others will sound just plain dated. No wonder Carla and Mick Taylor walked out of the band after a few gigs. BUT there are some wonderful parts here too. I have to admit it is an acquired taste ...so give it a couple of chances before sending it to the used cd store."
1,This software should be free !,And even then I wouldn't recommend it. I found this software simple and unhelpful. There is no great organization capability and the program seems to waste a lot of disk space needlessly. I origianlly worked with Sonicstage (Sony) which I thought was great. Unfortunately Sonicstage copyright protects everything and it is therefore impossible to transfer music from one computer to the next. I bought mp3maker to solve this problem. It turned out to be a great irritation.
2,TERRIBLE,"The only thing to recommend this software is the somewhat intuitive interface. Otherwise, this is the worst ripper I have ever worked with. Almost every track I ripped, both on my laptop and home PC have beeps, pops and annoyances. Almost nothing is listenable.It is also one of the slowest I have used, and some CDs, for no reason I could find, just wouldn't rip. It would find the songs and then start to rip and just suddenly start moving at a pace where it would have taken about 8 hours to rip one album.Then, when I went to burn a music CD...a simple project, right?...it NEVER completed the burn. Always an error about halfway through, so I ended up with a handful of half complete CDs before I finally just gave up.Don't use this software!!"
2,not bad for the price..,"I purchased this product to record and encode music from a large collection of LPs I have. The product is not the easiest to use, and it took me several hours of ""messing around"" to finally get a good process for recording, cleaning up and converting to mp3. I think the audio editor is not bad, but the controls for cleaning up hisses/pops/hums etc. that typically come from LPs is lacking. I also discovered that there is another product from this company called ""audio cleaning lab"" that contains the additional cleanup features I was looking for and does a much better job overall with the record-edit-convert to mp3 process than this product. Bottom line, for 30 bucks it isn't too bad and it gets the job done after spending some time with it. But if you are intending to record LPs to digital format and clean them up, I think the audio cleanup lab may be a better fit."
4,Great guitar for the price,"I never buy a guitar without seeing it and playing it in person, but in this case I just went for it. Having owned two Epiphones, I know they are great guitars at a good price. And I had just visited the Gibson factory in Memphis where they make the real thing (the Epiphones are produced in low-wage countries).The shipment arrived early and the instrument was in excellent shape. After tuning, I was happy that it sounded great all across the fretboard. The looks are amazing. You can see the wood grain under the lacquer and overall finish is very good.I sold my Les Paul Classic but still own an Epiphone Les Paul sunburst. So the Dot should complement that, and it does. The Les Paul sounds more aggressive and the Dot has a more mellow tone, ideal for blues. By switching to the neck or bridge pickup, the tone changes dramatically. The neck is easy to play but the body is large!"
5,this thing rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,first off i gave it a 5 only because there wasnt a 10 star button. this thing is a jam. my uncle had me work on it when he got it and after adjusting the neck and slap new strings on it(use DR's)it rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!! BUY IT NOW YA FOOL!!!!!!!!!!! this is a jam i played it for houres and houres on end when i took it home.
1,G.G. Allin is pretty darn sick.,"GG Allin is by far the sickest man on the face of the earth (even though he is deceased). Also it is not just me that feels this way, many of my coleeges also feel this way. When I saw his documentery I was absulutly appauled and never do I want to think about him again. Besides only one of his songs was actually good... NOT!!!!"
2,Less than ordinary,"I wish I hadn't bought this book. There are only three afghans I would even consider making, and they're nothing special. Get it from the library before you buy it."
1,Broken glass,This is the second time that I have ordered these glasses. The first time there was 1 broken out of the three six glass boxes. This time there were two broken glasses .I will not be ordering again.
1,smashed!,"These glasses arrived completely smashed to pieces. So much so that I was afraid of slicing myself and couldn't even open the box to check how many are broken (sounds like all of them ). Almost no padding in the box, so what else would you expect. Re-ordering the glasses as I want them and sending the smashed set back. I hope I can change my review and this was a one-time thing. Nothing from Amazon has ever arrived damaged."
1,Two of six arrived broken,"It's a crapshoot buying glassware from Amazon. They have great selections, and these are wonderful shot glasses, but they were poorly packaged and only four of the six survived. Huge pain to return and no guarantee the replacements will be undamaged."
5,Should be a 10 star,"I am very sensitive to chemicals. I give the HealthMate Plus credit for saving my life. With it in my home I can handle odors and chemicals from other apartments and the outside.Mine has been thru neighbors painting, and remodeling. I did have a break down with it and the warranty was honored. They even put an emergency tag on the repair so it was repaired faster.The newer ones are so much more quieter than the old ones. When I got mine back from the factory I was constantly putting my hand on it to see if it was running. It was just so quiet.This is one of the first items that I recommend for a chemically sensitive person to buy.When the box arrived all I had to do was lift the box off and plug it in. It was so well packed I was impressed."
3,Mediocre build quality.,"Pros:Looks slick. Budget priced. Combo interface (USB 2.0 and firewire). Fanless silent operation.Cons:Plastic tray. Plastic is VERY poor heat conductor. (it's more of insulator) Aluminum panels don't make good (if any) contact with the drive. Without any fan to move air, I wonder how it's supposed to dissipate the heat. If the aluminum side panels don't act as a heat sink, they will just trap the air inside the case, and make the heat situation worse.Contrary to popular myth, the aluminum case getting hot is actually the indication of the case acting as good heat sink. That's how it helps to cool down the drive. If the case doesn't get hot, and there is no fan, the drive is trapped inside the case without any means of dissipating heat.The firewire interface didn't work well for me. When connected to a computer via firewire, the computer acknowledged the removable drive, but didn't recognize the volume on the drive. The only option was reformatting, which is unacceptable."
1,Poor quality,This thing conked out on me and destroyed my harddrive pretty quickly. I would purchase a more reliable product than this.
5,Quite Sublime Kenny,"From the Bebop Boys to the Jazz Prophets to Joey Henderson, Kenny came through on the cutting edge. This is Kenny's only single-horn quartet session. He probably could have made a dozen of them, but he was a giver and favored the two horn conversations of a quintet most frequently. This record, much like all of Kenny's stuff, is all about a balanced approach to material, and assurance. He hits the right notes quite often, and his compositions don't suffer one bit side by side to the other classics here. Did I mention soul? When you see a record like this you're immediately reminded of many many others with these players (Tommy Flanagan, A.T. & P.C.) in this vein, and are tempted to pass because you think it might be too similiar to them to justify yet another purchase. Don't do that. There really is only a finite number of things like this in existence, people, and they aren't making any more."
1,Needs to be replaced,"This is one of Osprey's oldest Men-at-Arms books, and is in dire need of replacement. The book never addresses its topic--the soldiers of the late imperial legions. The first half of the book covers Hadrian's Wall. The rest of the book discusses the archeological remains of armor, helmets, and swords. This book contains no discussion of the actual soldiers, battle formations, campaigns, tactics, historical antecdotes, or anything along the lines of what has become standard for the Men-at-Arms series. ""The Rebuplican Roman Army, 200-104 BC"" is hands down one of the best Men-at-Arms titles I've ever read, this book however is one of the worst, and I think a new one should be commissioned more along the lines of the former. For a better discussion of the soldiers of this period (and much better full-color plates), I recommend ""Greece and Rome at War"" by Peter Connonlly."
3,etwas kopflastig,"Diesem Heft mangelt es an einer ausgewogenen Darstellung. Über die römische Armee gibt es mittlerweile sehr gute Werke, über alle Jahrhunderte, von der Republik bis zur letzten Dynastie.Hier aber kommt man nicht auf seine Kosten. Es fehlt an den versprochenen Informationen zum angekündigten Zeitabschnitt. Wir erfahren zwar einiges über den Hadrianswall, doch zu wenig über die römische Armee dieser Epoche.Wer sich für das Thema interessiert, sollte auf andere Werke ausweichen."
4,Good Late Roman,"The later Imperial Roman period has always been fascinating to me, but it is hard to find very detailed information on uniforms, armor, etc. This is one of several Osprey books that remedy this problem excellently."
3,Rock and Load!,"I heard about this film and I really wanted it to be as ridiculous as the plot sounded. I was in the mood for a so bad it's good film. Well unfortunately some of this movie was decent which kind of ruined the film for me. This movie couldnt make up it's mind, it either wanted to be over the top, but then it tried to be serious. Im sorry but when you have Dolph Lundgren who is playing a drummer and stabs someone in the eye with drum sticks, and plays a guitar loudly to distract the terrorist, and says lines like Rock and load, you dont turn the rest of the movie into a serious Die Hard rip off. Maybe if Dolph destroyed tons of bad guys at the end I would have given this a higher rating. But the film dosent even give you that. Its just average at it's core. The sad thing is I have seen Dolph films that are worse than this one LOOOOL!"
3,ROCK N' LOAD!!!,"When I first watched this movie online, I hated it!!! But then I decided to give it another shot. Dolph directed films such as ""The Defender"" and ""The Russian Specialist"" are my favorites! So, I watched ""Command Performance"" a second time and it was okay. Then, I watched it a third time and I liked it! The movie grows on you.Melissa Smith is so HOT!!! I always get ""Lost in Love"" with her when I watch Command Performance. She should have her own CD and record deal.Dolph delievers the rock n' roll action!!! There are plenty of catch phrases or one liners that are awesome!!This movie is like ""Die Hard in an arena."" Dolph kicks @$$ & plays the drums!!!Dolph is still in shape and he beats up & kills the terrorists!!!!Dolph Lundgren should direct all his films!!!I can't wait for ""The Expendables"" and ""Icarus""ROCK N' LOAD!!!"
3,A less than commanding performance,Command Performance is a silly film that I wish would have played up the comedy a little more. Dolph is also just way too old for this kind of role. I am sure I would have loved this film if he did it 20 years ago.The movie was OK. I wouldn't watch it a second time though.
4,WOW!!!,"Dolph can definitely act and direct.This is even better than Missionary Man.I like the idea that an old burn-out rocker can ""get it together"",take charge,kick butt and get the girl.Melissa Smith was SMOKING HOT!My Italian blood pressure was off the charts. My testosterone level was thru the roof for days!I liked the way she looked at him in the beginning-with admiration and sensual interest.It is never too late for old warriors(like me) to get the girl.My copy did not have any extras,and I would have liked to see how the film was produced,with interviews,etc.The music thruout the film was great and made the movie.I hummed Melissa's opening tune ""Lost in Love""for days!The one liners Dolph had were great!Remember- ""Watch the hair ,dude!""when he fought the first man in the restroom? Get this film ,you will love it and be surprised how far Dolph has come in the movie industry."
3,Surprisingly not bad,"It has been a while, and I mean a while, since I've checked out anything that has Dolph Lundgren as the main star. However, there was something about Command Performance that made me want to see it, so I gave it a chance, and it turns out that it actually isn't half bad, and probably one of the best things that Dolph has ever starred in. Dolph (who also directs) stars as Joe, an aging drummer in a band that is opening for a huge American pop princess (Melissa Smith) in Moscow, when out of nowhere terrorists make their presence felt. Before you know it, things basically go into Die Hard mode, but what stops Command Performance from turning into a yawn-fest are some well assembled action sequences and even some surprisingly decent acting. Lundgren is enjoyable as he can be, and former Pussycat Doll contender Melissa Smith is a sight to behold. All in all, you'll certainly see better action flicks than Command Performance, and you'll certainly see worse ones too."
4,"Great, but, how about a *new* album??","This is fanatastic collection of some of Cohen's finest songs. He is in fine voice, the band is tight, and the female vox from the great Jennifer Warnes really closes the deal. I'm a big fan of Cohen's late 70's stuff, and this expertly-recorded live album delivers with open, spacious readings of these gems. Just leaves me yearning for another new studio record from this great poet."
3,Cubs Win!,"I received this as a gift, and being the avid Cubs fan I thought it was a cute little novelty item. I can't say it gets a ton of use with the advent of the ""twist-top"" on most beer bottles.Once the metal prongs are engaged on this contraption, a built in speaker begins playing a clip of Chip Caray screaming, ""Swung on, hit high in the air, this ball could be outta here, Cubs win! Cubs win!"" By the time he gets to Cubs win the opener has already made it back to my drawer and the beer has already made it to my lips... it always seems to make my beer a little more bitter though, and a small tear roll down my eye. 100 years and counting... sigh."
4,"So beautiful, you'll get the chills!","This record is a stunning debut from two of Austin's most talented young songwriters. At once emotional and subdued, the songs float around themes of secret passions, unrest, and always the encroaching shadow of death. The arrangements are sparse and pure, and the lyrics are dreamy and poetic. Definitely check this out if you like Belle & Sebastian or Nick Drake...."
5,Simply Unbelievable.,"This is my favorite CD ever. You will never hear Basie any better than this. I wrote a paper on this album for language arts. Everything is great. Jimmy Forrest's rendition of ""Bag of Dreams"" is one of the greatest jazz ballads I've ever heard. Al Grey plays ""The More I See You,"" and, well, he's Al Grey. You probably already own some of these songs, but it doesn't matter. The performance may even make you re-think your opinion on some charts (for me, it did this on ""Freckle Face"" - I love it!) The band, especially drummer Butch Miles injects everything with unmatched energy. Not a low point on the whole CD. I recommend this CD for anyone - jazz afficionados, or those looking for an introduction. Buy it."
4,Very good Basie...,"The only reason I gave this a four star is that I would have liked to hear it done in a studio.It could have been controlled better. Just my opinion. Other then that,It's great stuff!"
5,Kudos to Kaplan,"Robbie Kaplan's latest publication, How to Say It In Your Job Search is really three comprehensive guides rolled into one fabulous book. As always, her suggestions about resume preparation are the best in the business. Robbie is equally versed in what to say in cover letters and interviews. As a bonus, she has woven information about using electronics and the Internet into each section, which replaces the need for an e-job search book too. Her style is dynamic, up to date and reader friendly. How to Say It In Your Job Search is the only self-help book job seekers need to conduct a successful job search."
4,Great story,"This is a great story that exposes young children to ""outside of the box"" thinking. The protagonist is a bi-racial little girl who is teased because she claims to be an African princess. Her family then goes to her mother's home-country in Africa and visits her grandmother. The little girl then returns home and feels empowered to be herself! Great story. Only 4 stars because the illustrations could be a less abstract in parts."
4,necessary purchase,"Since I am a diabetic, this is a product much used. The fact that it was ten boxes with such a good price caused me to order the product. Shipment was received in a timely manner.Very happy with the way entire transaction was handled.This was purchased through Amazon Shopping who I usually use when searching products and prices."
1,Is this really by visionaire? I am very disappointed!,"After I opened #31, I felt very disappointed. I decided to retrun this book. I can't feel any desgin in this book. About the cover, I have never seen any jeans jacket as ugly as this. I don't think I can wear this jacket outside my room. About those posters, I don't think they were the work by artist or desginer. I don't know why the editor put these photos into visionaire. I can't get any good feeling, any subject or any style from these posters. As a whole, I don't think that is design. That is a box of posters. What is this degsign? How can I look at those posters? Open them, one by one and then put them back into the box! This action like a fool. Compare with #30. I can't believe it was published by same company. I hope #32 will be better."
4,Swell Introductory Text,Ms. Barnes's coffee-table book is a superb addition to the general art-lover's library. Lush illustrations and accessible prose make this book the perfect introduction to the men and art of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
5,Excellent book; from Beaufighters to Mosquitoes,"This was my first book on night fighters during WWII, and l loved it. I had no idea how these pilots physically flew these aircraft at night, let alone find and kill enemy aircraft. I particularly liked the change-of-pace of this book being from the navigator's point of view instead of the pilot's.I've flown in an F-16 at night and can't fathom how pilots performed these feats without modern navigation, radar, and night vision technology. These pilots had guts."
4,A break from the norm,"I picked up ""Animist"" because I wanted something other than the now-cliche' dragons, paladins, elves and heroes defeating Ultimate Evil and bringing about world peace. After a while, all the fantasy paperbacks start to resemble each other. ""Animist,"" though, broke that model. It's a single character-focused tale that holds your attention without the need for a lot of flash and bang, magic swords, curses and the like. And the conclusion ... well, I don't want to ruin it for the next reader, but it's safe to say that I felt it was a real life - not tidy, but satisfying just the same. Eve Forward's writing skills are easily above average; the story was pleasant to consume. But her voice lacks a unique personality or sparkle that would set it apart if not for the plot and setting (her take on magic ""colleges"" was refreshing). She's good now, but she reveals potential that will likely develop in her next book."
3,A disappointment after Villians of Necessity,"Having read Villians of Necessity, I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately, the plot lacked much in the way of excitement. The flow of the book was predictable and not nearly as humorous as VoN.Not to say the book is bad, The Animist is a decent read, but I recommend waiting for paperback."
4,Fun and Well Written,"The Animist, by Eve Forward was a fun fast read. Alex, a graduate from the College of Animism, is sent out into the world to find an Anim, an animal for him to bond with who will give him extra powers. His innocence in the ways of the world and his affiliation with the college prove dangerous and Alex barely escapes with his life intact.Forward has created an engaging world with unique characters and a strong story line. I look forward to reading more about the characters, and about the world they live in. This just missed being a five book, a keeper, rather than a four, because the writing was not tight enough and I found myself skimmed through the book in several sections."
3,Some Appeal,"This book had some appeal, decent writing and story interesting. Not much punch, though, as in excitement or intriuge, etc. Your average fantasy novel, hence the 3 star rating."
4,Exasperating.,An interesting novel with several twists however it was tedious. The climax of the novel was not worth the wait.
2,Okay,It was okay - pretty cheaply made but looked acceptible and the price is cheap so you get what you pay for
3,So So,I was not a huge fan of this costume. It sizing is kind of wierd so it was huge on me and smelled like it had been in storage for a while. I was able to alter it to fit properly so at least it was easy to make it work. It was a cute concept but not a great costume. I will probably go to the halloween store next time and try the costume on first.
1,Marketing people are laughing and counting their cash from idiots like us,"Ghost Lake looks like a movie put together by a couple of high school students. Bad acting, bad special effects, stupid dialog and the list goes on and on. Dont become a victim of dvd marketing people. Ignore the cover and read the reviews!"
1,Horrible Acting!,"I've seen better acting at my son's elementary schools' plays! This movie totally blew! And as for ""special effects""? If a melted wax figurine is your idea of scary, then you're about as lame as this movie. I wouldn't waste 25 cents on this waste of a DVD let alone 22 bucks! Thankfully I wasted no money on this as I rented it from our library."
4,Great little horror film!,I rented this movie yesterday and really enjoyed it! It's moody and spooky and has some great scares but it also has an intricately plotted story -- something that is sorely lacking in many horror movies these days. It stars a cute blonde actress named Tatum Adair who is very good in the film and successfully pulls off a wide range of emotions. The movie also features some great locations and effects and a spooky little girl who really creeped me out. If you enjoy low budget horror movies this one is pretty fun!
2,SOGGY GHOST STORY,"THINGS GOING AGAINST THIS MOVIE:1. Gregory Lee Kenyon who plays the sheriff was in the even worse DEMONICUS.2. Jay Woelfel practically did EVERYTHING in this movie: wrote, directed, did the score, edited, casted, etc.3. Aforementioned Kenyon was also credited as ""grips"" in the final credits.4. The movie's plot is so engimatic it doesn't make sense.5. Timothy Prindle DOES look a lot like Lorenzo Lamas, but can't act nearly as good, which is bad because Lorenzo's not very good anyway.6. Poor Azure Sky Decker (as the twin girls) is probably the worst child actress I've seen.7. The meager special effects are pretty bad even for a low budget movie.8. It's just not scary and it's too long.Not worth it."
1,Awful,This movie sucks... Will never buy it again... However it was filmed in the area where I live and some people in it I have met
4,blue eyed fusion,"This album was unexpectedly excellent when I picked it up years ago at a thrift store and thought I would take a chance after reading the inserts. Quincy Jones thought so also . He featured Ai No Corrida on one of his albums. This album blends dance, latin,and jazz themes throughout and has three very affecting instrumentals that alone make the album worth buying. I have several of his albums and this one is the best."
1,TOPPER by Thorne Smith,"I don't know who Oak Grove is, but they, like MacMay, have infringed on the rights of the estate of Thorne Smith by publishing this book (and other Thorne Smith titles) on Kindle.We shall pursue the matter with Oak Grove.We represent the copyright interests of Thorne Smith."
3,Not as good as others,"I started reading Thorne Smith with The Stray Lamb, which was very enjoyable. I was dissapointed with Topper. It just wasn't as funny."
4,High and Low Spirits,"The movie and TV versions of ""Topper"" have always emphasized the trick of ghosts appearing and disappearing... but the novel is really about Mr. Topper's love/hate relationship to middle-class conformity, and how he's drawn toward love and death. As with many of Smith's books, there's an undertow of sadness about how brief and unsatisfying life can be, and a true satirist's rage at hypocrisy and repression. Set in the same period as ""The Great Gatsby,"" this is almost a companion piece -- another story about longing and belonging, fast driving and fast living, and dropouts living a very different life than those around them."
4,Madcap haunting,"I loved this book the first time I read it. This time it was less charming, though still fun. It all begins when Cosmo Topper, the epitome of Humdrum Life buys a car -- and discovers too late that it is haunted. Yes, haunted, and by outrageously adventuresome ghosts as well. Ghosts that drag poor Cosmo from one scrape to another and convert his Humdrum to Mayhem. Great Fun!"
2,Overview of Over priced,This single is actually a pretty decent single but it is more or less resembles a domestic Released two track single... US so basicly you are putting in the extra money for some... cd rom quick time extras. The slipknot remix is an amature/decent remix it stayed to much to the origianal wich created some annoyance when the extra loops and effects were thrown on top of the already established song. So unless your into collecting the funny little tarrot cards then just buy the... Ep Fight song it will save you... and has all the recent single b sides on it.
4,I like the song more than Disposable Teens but....,"This is Manson's second single off of the 2000, Holy Wood album and it's a better song than the first single, Disposable Teens, but there's no real supporting b-side material. There's a Slipknot remix and that's it. The enhancements, however save it, with an uncensored video of Disposable Teens, song lyrics, a picture gallery and a really slick display. This is worth the buy, overall for Manson fans, but where are those awesome b-sides?"
5,My God! My God!!!,"Mr. Asawa is flawless on this album, but then again I may be biased since he is one of my favorite Countertenors and since I am a starting Countertenor myself. I particularly fell in love with Villa-Lobos''Cancao do amor,'and 'Bachinas Brasilieras.' Not to mention ALL of the works by Rachmaninov; YES even the vocalise!Mr. Asawa's voice is deliciously full and sensual as well as smooth. I agree with the above person who wrote that we should review this based on the fact that he as a classical vocalist is simply good! Not because he's good as far as being a countertenor is concerned or the fact that he sounds better/poorly than a mezzo. He's a vocalist and a damn good on in his own right. Give him his due for what he has put out. I truly love this album and Mr. Asawa.I give it a 20 on a scale from 1-19!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"Student level performance. No artistry, no subtelties.",There is not much emotion in Mr. Asawa's performance of Rachmaninov and no deep penetration into that great music.
1,Worse than anything,I guess those who rave about this recording have tin ears. I heard an incipient wobble allied to a colorless sound and a total interpretive cipher. But to each his own!! I just feel sorry for anybody who thinks this represents good singing.
2,Not Worth It,"It worked good enough for roughly three months then the problem started. Now, it regularly drops from 40% battery charge to 0% forcing my ibook to die prematurely regularly. So, if you want a 60% battery, buy this one. Otherwise, stay away."
2,Not a reference book,"This is a book containing a lot of information on many aspects of detailing with SolidWorks. Unforunately if, like me, you are an experienced SolidWorks user requiring a reference book to refresh your memory occasionally on rarely used commands it is very frustrating. There is no index, so after reading it from cover to cover all you can do later is to search manually for the item you know is in there somewhere. An expensive, non colour book which, because of it's 'work through School Book style' will be of limited use to me in the future."
5,The Best Book You Have Yet To Read.,"Julie Ann Peters is pure genius, and she proves it over and over again in Keeping You a Secret. I won't give up too much info. on the book, but wow. The story is touching, the humor is so witty that I found myself dropping the book as I fell to the floor laughing, and best of all the characters are real. The book tackles important issues which are often left untouched and overlooked by most authors. It couldn't be better if she tried- Peters writes brilliance with paper and ink in Keeping You a Secret."
2,Mediocre,"I was extremely excited to read this book, but I must admit, it was a bit of a let down. I finished the book in about 3 or 4 days, and that was during the work week. It was too easy of a read, meaning that the story itself was simple, predictable, and had no depth. Cece was a big Mary-Sue and a lot of the time turned out to be rather annoying. I'm a lesbian myself, but she took pride way too far reminding me of the ""fema-nazi"" feminists. All for it, but please, tone it down. I was expecting much more of this book and it let me down."
2,Not That Good,"I read half way through the book and then had to start skipping ahead to finish. I like that the book deals with the issues of self realization, coming out, and the pain of rejection, but everything was just too extreme. From the reaction of Holland's mother, to Holland's unwaivering and unbelievable teenage conviction, everything was at the far end of the spectrum. However, the character of Cece was by far the most unbelievable thing in the book. I also couldn't believe that Holland would come out to a mother who was so controlling. She would have been able to guess at the reaction she would get from such a controlling person, so why wouldn't she just lie until they were caught (by her mother) or until she moved away from home? I have read other books that have dealt with teen lesbianism and I think this one was just too dramatic. I also didn't feel much passion between the two, unlike in books such as Annie on Mind or Patience and Sarah. Worth reading if you're a gay teen though."
3,Kept me reading...,"Keeping You A Secret is about a young teenager named Holland. Holland is dating her high school sweet heart, Seth. Hollands feelings about Seth change when she notices a new kid in school who is very open about how ""she is"". Cece is a lesbian. Holland knows this but she is confused about her mixed feelings for both Seth and Cece. Holland and Cece become really good friends and Hollands old friends dont like it. Holland and Cece start getting intimate and it was time to tell Seth the truth. He was outraged. When Holland needed her friends the most they werent there to help her. Hollands parents found out and she was kicked out so she ended up living with Cece for a while until she found an old run down appartment that she got rent free until she got back up on her feet again. Read this story to find out how it all ends up at the end..."
3,missing something,I dont know what it was but to me the story wasnt what i was expecting. To me it was missing something. It needed more detail.
3,Good Summer Read,"While I will admit that this is a good summer read, I would not call this book a MUST read. It had a good plot, but had somewhat boring, and at times unbelievable characters. Although I am not gay, I did enjoy seeing what it's like to come out through someone else's eyes. I will never know the pains of coming out, but this book gave me a good idea of what it's like on the other end. It is the story of Holland, a high school senior who is coming to terms with her own sexuality and her feelings for the mysterious and exciting CeCe. It taught me not to judge people and showed me that everyone should be treated equally no matter what. I would reccomend you read this book at some point, whether you are gay, bisexual, straight, or homophobic. It really does have depth to it if you take the time to see it."
3,Huh,"Similar to my story, but more simple and less guilt. An easy read. I can recommend this book to teens at work."
5,Keeping you a secret,Amazing! This book truly embodies the struggles of self discoveries and rejection as a teenager. It perfectly portrays the deep passion and need Holland feels for cece. I'd recommend this to anybody.
3,Slow down...,"My disappointment with this book could somewhat be a result of expecting too much from it. I felt the story was extremely rushed, and there was not enough time taken for character development. It was hard to take any of Holland's friendships or relationships seriously - they just didn't seem realistic. All of the characters seemed ""black or white.""This book did do a nice job of communicating to the reader the pain of coming out as a homosexual. But I personally feel the entire book could have benefited if Peters had slowed down and let things develop naturally."
4,Good Book,"I thought this was a good book. It is hard to come out to your family and friends, and especially to yourself. I thought to portrayal of it all was very believeable."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I bought this CD mostly on the strength of Radney Foster, who helped discover and produce Georgia. As a huge Radney Foster fan, this sort of endorsement was all I really needed, so I went ahead and just ordered the album. I should have known better. Although she may be very talented, most of her success has been from the song-writing end of the spectrum. In fact, the lyrics on this album are outstanding. But I can't help but think that on the good songs she's written in the past, that she's had competent co-authors to cover the instrumentation. Because on this effort, the music itself is uninspired, and limp at best. It takes more than clever words to craft a good song. I walked away feeling that Georgia, for all her talent, should have worked with some more writers for the content on this album, or stick with songwriting in the future."
2,Some Nice Shock Images--But No Direction,"Bentley Little is no masterful literary writer. I think that's clear. But, after reading ""University,"" ""The Ignored,"" and ""The Walking,"" I see that he has some good stories and some frightening, if somewhat unoriginal, images. The problem with ""University,"" however, is that Little throws out all these interesting plots, but he fails to bring them together in the end. ""University's"" first half is nice and suspenseful, I'll give it that, but by the weak climax, the story blows up with the campus. This novel steals too much from ""The Shining."" So do yourself a favor and stick with Stephen King."
3,Bentley Little,If this person would leave the sicking nasty smut crap out of his books or just tone it it down! These would be as good as Dean Koontz's writings. This Little reminds me of how Steven King writes.. wouldn't surprise me if its him using another name lol Same nasty writing as his
2,"Please, Let's Get to the POINT!","Although I must admit, I was taken by the book during the first half, but I was surely LOST in the last half section. I mean, the characters became uninteresing to the point that I just did NOT care anymore! And the whole concept of ""The Computer Monster"" became simply just stupid."
2,Disappointing,"Gorman has demonstrated that he is a top-notch photographer of nudes and erotic nudes in the controlled environment of his apartment. I enjoyed his stylized black-and-white work in his previous ""Naked"" book. However, this book suffers from its format (the pages are too small) and the quality of pictures. Admittedly, Gorman's purpose was to give his subjects a raw, in-the-moment appearance. Unfortunately, despite Gorman's use of a variety of cameras, too many of these photos have the appearance of rushed, out-of-focus snapshots taken on a cheap instant camera."
5,Gorman Is No One Trick Pony,"I have Peter Gorman's first book ""Naked in Apartment 7"" and when I heard he had another book coming out I was thrilled to see more of this man's work. What I did not expect was it to be so different from his first book and different it is, this work is in color and has more of a snap shot feel but the moments of catching his naked models in their own apartments is beyond exciting. To see these women in what seems to be very real moments, I have to say is all the more intriguing. The women are beautiful and the photos are alive. Highly recommended.Sorry to be anonymous, but where I am from this book and these photos would not be understood as art."
2,What is the point of a photo book with 70% of them out of focus?,"Ok, granted the idea of having a group of very average girls (but no fat ones) photographed naked in their apartments (Which must not be arraigned to look tidy. It shall stay just as it is, as if the photographer walked in unexpectedly) is interesting, and because the models are the ones who dictate what they are going to do, and not Mr. Morgan, there is a spontaneity about them which is great and some (but very few) are intensely erotic because of their honesty.However, how find to rhyme or reason for selecting a large group of them out of focus, to show movement? Its looks more like the photos taken by a friend from school who does not have a clue about how to graduate the speed of light in the camera. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,A Basic Audio Editor,"This is a very attractive looking entry level program that for the most part is relatively easy to use. Simple to make basic cut and paste edits. Filtering lacks the sophistication of more expensive products making its less than adequate if you are converting scratched vinyl records or older tape cassettes to CD. I used this product in conjunction with Diamond Cut Millennium (a much more robust product designed for vinyl restoration) for seven months. The program documentation states that changes to your operating system may cause the program to inactivate your registration and stop working. In my experience, this happened and the re-activation process built into the program did not work. If this happens, you will find there is no support for this product. Repeated e-mail efforts over a three week period produced no results. I was forced to replace the product with Goldwave which seems to have a few more restoration type features but and is slightly more expensive."
5,The BEST Software to Convert LP's and Cassettes to Digital,"I have tried several software programs to make digital copies of my old LP's and cassettes. Very frustrating, until I stumbled on this one. It is AWESOME and AMAZING! You can visually edit the wave files which is a feature that no one else had. That is very helpful for dropping in CD track markers, taking out live applause, etc. After you have converted all your old LP's and cassettes, there are still more fun things you can do with this software, like record streaming audio."
3,i need help i am a beginner,I do not have a clue as to what I am doing and don't have a clue as to how to get started. But I have stuble up on making a mpg into a wave but I dont know how I did it I just was clicking and messing around with the software and and went back to my music and it was there. Please help me. It would help people like me if there was a step by step illustration on what steps to take to get the job done I know it will be wonerful when I figure it out. Someone please email me and help me sign the dummyJan1823@aol.comThank you very very much
1,Worst DVD,"Totally agree with one star ranking. In fact, people should get a refund. Lead actor is wooden, support actors look like students, back ground sets are poor; kung action are much better in OTHER movies....skip this one!!!!"
1,Stay Away,"Simplistic plot, poor acting, even poorer directing. This film is a disgrace to all Chinese; this film should never have been made."
1,Worst Kung-Fu Movie. Ever.,"I have watched my share of bad movies.I confess to a wide tolerance for bad movies. Especially when it has a Kung Fu theme.However, this movies BLOWS.It sucks so massively I am nearly at a loss of words to describe the suck-age that is this movie.Bad acting. Terrible dialogue. Stilted performance. Very bad choreography in the fight scenes.Almost any other Kung Fu movie is better by an order of 10x. I'm including all of those 1970's Saturday afternoon matinee fodder...A better movie? Any one of the recent Yip Man movies..."
2,"Good Attempt, but misses the mark","Other than some okay fight scenes and attractive females, this movie is pretty predictable and poorly acted. It lead me to fast forward to fight scenes and finished the movie in about 30 more minutes after the first 30 minutes of ""sheesh, I'm watching this why?"""
2,Not very interesting...,Sub-par story/script. Lead roles were blah. Kung Fu action scenes were OK. Flashbacks to monk period seemed disconnected from present day story??
2,The movie seams like it is the directors first attempt at directing.,I really feel like the director attempted to do a good job but had no prior experience. Most of the scenes seem like they were cut off midway in between the conversation. Plus several scenes seem forced as if the character had no purpose to actually be there talking. There were a few scenes that just did not need to exist. The acting was terrible but I believe that was in part due to poor directing. I just think the director was in over their head not knowing how to get the right amount of emotion from his actors to create the right feeling or mood from the scenes. A very interesting film but all together just awful. Great film to see so you know what not to do when attempting to direct the filming of a movie.
2,Not as amazed as everybody else.,"Yes, this is a pretty good review book. It has drugs stuffed into tables, and even includes some good text in the chapters. Unfortunately, there just isn't enough info in the book for a pharm class or a USMLE review. Run and buy Lippincotts if you want the best pharm book on Earth. Ridiculously simple, has alot of great books but this really isn't one of them. It is ok but really isn't all that useful. GO BUY LIPPINCOTTS NOW....Believe me that will make your pharm experience simple as it can be."
2,Mistakes! Mistakes! Mistakes!,"This new edition is filled with typos and mistakes. I wrote a letter to ""Dr"" Olson pointing out the errors that I found in his new edition. However, I have yet to hear from him. The previous edition is better. It has less typos."
2,A JOKE,Someone wrote that this book was wonderful for ANY pharmacology test. HAHAHAHAHA JOKE! Same way with Lippencotts... That is if you are taking REAL pharmacology. Don't waste your time with either of the books if you actually are expected to know something about Pharmacology.
2,Pe-Pe LaPu here I come,"Bought this CD from a Canadian net site. Had to have it ASAP. Waited. Loved the last CK CD quite a lot. Ghost Stories arrived. IT STINKS. She should have titled the thing ""The Leftovers"". It's like she wrote and sang it without outside editing while on heavy doses of anti depressants. The worst song on her last could beat the best one on here hands down. I'm pissed."
3,The Usual,"What can I say, it's a Jess Franco Film. As Most people who have seen a Jess Franc film knows, he avoids filming outright explicit sex, although he gets close at times. This one is no exception. For fans of Jess Franco, it may be worth a watch, for others, probably not. It is filled with nudity and sex ala Franco's style. It isn't as trashy as say ""Barbed Wire Dolls"" and seems to be a little better than that effort."
2,"cecilia,an unhappy beautiful woman","the plot was interesting,but movie has not complete issue.erotism is not only naked female body,rather exciting situations.the best example is ''belle de jouur''by l.bunuel"
1,Carbs ain't the real concern here,"He calls himself ""The Love Chef,"" but this guy's recipes are a real heartbreaker -- or, should I say, a heart-attack waiting to happen. Sure, they're low in carbs, but with many dishes containing more than 50 grams of fat per serving -- some even as high as 90 grams -- that's not amore. Proceed at your own risk, and remember, fettuccine Alfredo is the single worst dish you can have in terms of cholesterol and fat; thanks, Chef Anthony, but I'd rather have a plate full of carb-filled pasta and marinara sauce than the artery-clogging stuff you're selling us."
3,Good Video,This video is great for covering a quick snapshot of the entire country of Japan. I feel it spends too much time in the outer areas instead of focusing on Tokyo and Kyoto. I was looking for a video that would show you how to get around in the bigger cities. All in all is was a good video but not what I was looking for.
4,"Very Good movie, crappy voice!","The movie is all around really good, kinda annoying narrator. The visuals are wonderful, and very informative."
2,Nothing impressive,No doubt Japan is a wonderful country but this video is far from it. It is a very basic and simple introduction to Japan and in the modern times of high tech videos this one seems to be 40 years old.
2,Dissappointment after many great albums,"Cursive is one of my favorite bands and I was looking forward to Happy Hollow. It's a dissappointment. The album abandons the kind of pop core that Cursive specializes in, perhaps to pursue a more sophisticated and complex sound; the result feels more sophomoric, and the album is more plodding and less melodic than any of their others. Another oddity is Tim Kasher's voice, which sounds smoother and cleaner than in the past. Perhaps he's been taking singing lessons in an effort to preserve it. The sound is odd."
3,Sleepy Hollow by Cursive,"Cursive has been a favorite band of mine since the 90's. Though this cd is not even close to being their best album, it fits nicely with my collection."
4,Takes Some Getting Used To,"Upon first hearing this album, I was a little dissapointed. This was definitely not the album I expected. Very brash and a lot less ambient then past albums, Happy Hollow takes many unexpected musical twists and turns. The most obvious difference between this album and past Cursive releases is the horns. So many horns! The music itself is very upbeat and not nearly as sulky as say The Ugly Organ or Domestica. However, if you listen to it for what it is and not for what it isn't, you may find yourself liking this album a lot. The lyrics are all very brilliant and the song structure itself is impressive to say the least. And also Tim Kasher's voice has never sounded so good! Dropping the personal vendettas, Kasher has a lot to say on this album about war and Catholicism and America in general. Very politically motivated and at many times also very poignant, Happy Hollow is a brave step forward, and I for one love it and recommend it highly!"
3,Not The Ugly Organ,"not as impressed with this cd as i was The Ugly Organ. I was hoping for a bit of the same, but alas, I can bear it, but it's just not living up to my expectations."
2,Average at best,"I never liked Cursive, until I heard ""The Ugly Organ,"" which blew me away. Which is the real band?, I wondered.Now I know, ""Organ"" was the anomally. Blustery, tuneless rock here, and the horns are a major detraction."
2,WORSHIP SONGS FOR ATHIEST,"Engaging and enchanting music. Confussed and completely wrong-headed lyrics... Although Cursive delivers creative and stimulating music, there lyrics sound like an ignorent child. Cursives athiesm/nehilism leaves the listener with morbid, depressing and in my view wrong feelings."
4,"""across the northern border""","That song ""across the northern border"" has been in my head for about 6 years- I have no idea how I heard it first- perhaps college radio over lake champlain? I never heard it more than 2-3 times, but I have hummed the tune for so long that I finally today decided to try to remember the words, and magically, the web led me here to buy it. Wow. Its as good as I remember it. I love the female voice. It's authentic and natural. Would have done well at Woodstock as much as today. At least buy the ""northern border"" song at the very least."
2,Lost in the Woods,"The 1988 HBO film was based on a novel by Dan Jenkins concerning a pro golfer on the PGA Tour. While the TD music for the soundtrack was good background music during the film, this collection is a tee shot that hooks into the woods.The 22 tracks are essentially snippets - some are under one minute - with the longest cut being 3:22 for Theme From Dead Solid Perfect. That it wasn't released until 1990 may be a tip-off that there was a tussle on whether or not the material should be compiled for an album.For those seeking to complete a TD catalog, it was a possible good walk that's spoiled by the brevity of the numbers."
3,"Too thin, stretch too much","I would have to agree with the other reviews on the fact that these wipes are too thin. I also agree that huggies wipes are a lot better. When my son has a dirty diaper i have to fold the wipes to get a little more cloth between my hand and my baby in order to avoid any mess left on me. Also, I have a wiper warmer and whenever I pull the wipes out, they stretch too much. I don't know if it's a bad thing or not but for me, it's kind of annoying. They do the job its just the quality of the wipe is not all that great."
1,"Good price, but poor quality","The wipes are quite small and very thin. Not very helpful for those 'messy' ones, especially when you have to use twice as many."
1,"Very thin, need twice as many","I've used wipes from Luvs, Huggies and Pampers. The wipes from Luvs are by far the worst (although I LOVE Luvs diapers). You have to use 2-3 times more wipes for messy diapers, which makes the cost savings zilch. I will always purchase Luvs diapers, but never the wipes."
3,smaller and thinner than other brand,"I think these wipes are pretty good, but they are smaller and thinner than other brands, so i ended up using more wipes. Other brands i can wipe baby's bottom 2-3 times with each wipe just by folding it, but with these can only wipe once with each wipe. And if i pull it out too hard/quickly, they always tear into small pieces.I think they would be more suitable for a potty training toddler to wipe themselves. If the kid already went into the potty/toilet, they will not need as much wipes as it would in changing diapers. Overall its not bad wipes as long as you don't mind the smaller size."
1,Very thin wipes,I don't like the Luvs baby wipes at all. They are very thin and they rip very easily. I will not buy Luvs wipes again.
2,"Good for the money, but not my favorite wipe","This is a cheap wipe, and does the job, but you have to use way more than one wipe at a time to get the job done. They are really flimpsy, and don't smell good to me at all.Another downer is the packaging. There are 4 individual packs inside, but once you open them, that's it...there is no resealing. Kinda annoying when you want to refill your wipes case, and have to use the ENTIRE pack (and sometimes it doesn't want to all fit in there if you already have some remaining wipes).Go with Huggies Cucumber..."
1,not worth it,"i bought these due to the price value. . . as soon as i started using them, i immediately decided i'm never buying them again. they are very thin, and when used in the pop up containers, i seem to always get 2. due to them being thin, i have to use 2 at a time when my daughter has a bowel movement. spend the extra few dollars and get huggies or pampers brand. even the walmart brand is better!"
3,Not the best,"I bought a whole case of luvs wipes because it was cheaper and now whish I wouldn't have. After using Huggies wipes, these wipes would get a 1 star, but they are better than some, so I gave a 3 star. They are thin & slip on itself when doubled & trying to wipe. I will stick to Huggies wipes."
3,"Work, but not well as others...",They do not work as well as Huggies. They also do not stay as moist in the warmer.
2,Look elsewhere for baby wipes...,"I have to say that I was very disappointed with these wipes. I went with this cheaper brand, figuring there wasn't much anyone could do to mess up the manufacturing of baby wipes--boy was I wrong. While they have a pleasant baby powder scent and a soft texture, there's little more they offer. They don't clean well at all. I have to use at least 5 or so wipes to clean my baby's bottom after a bowel movement. As I mentioned, they are soft, but they're almost too soft. I would liken them to a wet toilet tissue consistency. They tear apart very easily; therefore, they are very inefficient at cleaning. I gave them two stars because they do smell great, and of course, they're cheap. But do yourself a favor and spend a few extra bucks on the good stuff. You'll use fewer wipes, and will probably spend less in the long run."
5,Better than Huggies Wipes!,"I love these wipes because they are softer than huggies and also softer than pampers brand. I used to prefer pampers, but these wipes seem like they clean much better than the other wipes and my son can have some messy diapers. By the way to the person who wrote about getting poo on your hand. With all of them you can get poo or have the smell of poo on your hands, I just fold the wipe in half or use two at the same time and you can avoid getting poo or the smell of poo(which mostly happens) off your hands."
2,Very flimsy wipes,"I just tried these wipes bc of the good price, but not worth it. They're very flimsy and thin and I get poo on my hands easily. I wound up using twice as many which defeated the purpose of more wipes for the $$$$$"
2,Wipes to thin,These wipes aren't bad but they are very thin. The huggies brand wipes are much more cloth like. With these you end up using more than you would with a thicker wipe. Too bad amazon doesn't sell the cloth like wipes as refills.
3,Some good rockabilly.,"This is a pretty good disc. ""Buck and the Black Cats"" were/are a country-swing-rockabilly band from Vermont, I think. I've seen them a time or two. For lack of a better comparison, I'd say they're similar to ""The Stray Cats"", though less pop, and more country. I actually like their album ""Tip Up with Buck and the Black Cats"" more, but this is a good play too. This isn't essential, but I'd pick it up if you find it for a few ""Bucks""."
5,The best flute music of the twentieth century,"There is a very good reason why the music of Liebermann has become so popular with flautists all over the world. As we all know, the flute does not have a very large repertoire, and certainly not a large repertoire of good pieces. Although there have been some very good flute concertos written this past century, Liebermann's concerto has to be considered the strongest, on the basis of its melodic, harmonic and technical inventiveness, not to mention the wildly colorful orchestration that surpasses even the concertos of Nielsen and Ibert. An even stronger argument in Liebermann's favor is the very high percentage of standing ovations his pieces receive in concert. When was the last time YOU saw an audience rise spontaneously to its feet after the Prokofiev Sonata or a Mozart concerto?Add to this Galway's impeccable playing and you have a disc that every serious flute student should own, not to mention anyone interested in the future of American music."
2,Should be labelled CEV!,"I was greatly disappointed to find that this was the ""Contemporary English Version"" rather than one of the standard translations. It should have been clear marked! The NT of this version may be all right for some purposes, but it does not deserve to be called a ""translation"" or even a ""paraphrase"". The NT which was written in ""trade"" Greek suffers much less than the Psalms which were written with skill and care by men who were poets. This kind of ""version"" is another exercise in the ""dumbing down"" practice so prevalent in our society."
5,Love this book!,Sarah Sullivan is a wonderful author. This book is great for a boy waiting to be a big brother--all the emotions he feels about the new baby sister. It's great.
2,bad discs,"Comes with discs that are labeled neither for metal nor masonry ...(and may not work well for either one ) ..... I tried to cut a small piece of steel and did more with a hack saw in 30 seconds than 2 minutes with this tool.It did spin very well, but double check that your compressor can handle the cubic feet per minute that this tool uses (11.8 cf/m @90 psi) --- it uses much more air than an impact wrench."
4,Prime Livgren material . . . Moving. . .thus its Prime Mover,"Prime Mover is a rerecording/rerelease of an album previously released by Livgren's former band, AD. I have never listened to the original Prime Mover album, but if it was half the quality of this disk, it was great material.In his earlier AD material, Livgren's exuberance over his rebirth sometimes overpowered his work. Gone was much of the subtlety that characterized his best Kansas material. By the time Prime Mover was created, he gained that subtlety back and he's put together some really good material here.Stand outs include Children of the Shadows, and Wandering Spirit. The remake of Fair Exchange, Kansas tune, is first rate, as are the new songs, Incantos and Out of Opus.New Kind of Love, a new kind of song for Livgren is the only tune that rubs me wrong. Just not my style, thats all.Production, material, performance all first rate, pick Prime Mover II up!Questions regarding this review, email me."
1,Rambling,"I don't claim to be near as knowledgeable as the author, but this book rambled forever and I don't feel it ever addressed the issue raised in its title. I got nothing out of it. Probably just over my head."
1,Umm...orginal?..no...[bad]...YES,"Okay I'll admit it... I used to be a Nu Metal fan back in the day...and I actually used to like this CD. (I have no idea what I saw in it). But I started getting into guitar and things and I noticed how talentless much of these Nu Metal and mainstream bands really were. Flybanger is just another example of that. Nothing is new here, just the same old band trying to make a spot for themselves on MTV or radio. If you are going to listen to Nu Metal i would suggest Nothingface, as they are one of the few good ones, whom I like. (Tool is another one). But I would also suggest bands such as Opeth, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Neurosis, Slayer, In Flames, Dream Theater, Soilwork, Meshuggah, God Forbid, etc. But that is just my opinion... I hope you choose to buy one of those band's CDs, instead of [this CD]. (Good thing I can trade CDs such as this one in)."
2,One Dominant's ego trip,"Unfortunately I was not as impressed with 'Sir John' as he obviously is with himself.He may or may not be describing real events, but it seems he has a talent for finding unstable and damaged women and treating them unsafely with little real emotional connection to most of them.He may seem like the Dom of some people's dreams, but the reality is this collection of tales lacks depth and while he expects the reader to be impressed, he falls short of what most responsible Dominants are."
3,I could not put it down!!!!!!!,"This was a very exciting book for the imagination. I could not put the book down until I had completed it. Sir. John was well loved and respected by all of his Sumissive slaves, although issues of safety was not mentioned.I did feel that some of this book, probably was fantasy. Some scenes described in this book, I found hard to imagine any human being , being able to withstand. All in all, I found this book very entertaining, Sensual, sexually arrousing and most of all very intense. I would reccommend it for anyone who has a wild imagination and a lust for the S/M world Not for the weak at heart."
1,Not recommended for anyone desiring to learn more about S/M,"The Q letters is quite possibly the worst written and most unrealistic presentation of S/M in a non-fiction form I have ever encountered. From the first lovingly written vignette describing his first rape to the seemingly endless parade of emotionally unstable self destructive women that grovel at his feet, the Q letters reads more like a disturbed adolescents wet dreams than a serious presentation of the S/M lifestyle. Despite seemingly accidental intermittent accuracy regarding scene practices (sandwiched between raging misogyny and the obligatory orgasm count after every one sided encounter) the Q letters is far more damaging to the understanding of this form of sexuality than it is educational, despite its common use in academic treatments . And perhaps its worse offense, it is a boring read, no mean feat regarding the subject matter."
3,It's okay,"If you like mediocre-tasting health bars, then this is probably good for you. They didn't really taste like apples, and definitely wasn't heavenly. It was okay, but not great. I like this kind of bar to eat for breakfast. I did eat all 12 of them, but probably won't be ordering more. I'll try another kind next time."
4,Like a Salmon in Every Bar,"100% of your RDA of Omega-3. 5g Fiber. 180 calories. Not much else going on nutritionally, but goes down easier than nasty fish oil pills. These bars actually taste good. I tell my kid it is apple cake. He's 2, so he believes me."
5,Just sweet enough,I like these bars for hiking.Most bars are way too sweet for me. lots of protein and fiber.
2,Below average bars overall,"Out of the three persons from my friends and family who have tasted the bars nobody liked the product. They all were asking me: ""Where did you get this stuff from? It is awful."" The bars are really average or even below average as far as the taste is concerned. The energy value apart, the only positive thing about the bars is that they are not very sweet. But my understanding is the the food (bars including) is supposed to be at least a bit tasty but not only a 'filler' for your stomach. Definitely I will never buy these bars again."
5,Melodi and a pure sound.,"Lovely, album with originality and inteligent lirycs plus the sound is not even abit dissapointing leaving you wanting more & more of unearth. I first heart unearth way back and they did a hell of a performance which made me realy be into their sound!Its for any one into pure brilliant melodic guitar riffs and just pure plain metal!Worth it..."
5,Amazing Debut From Unearth,"This album is jawbreaking, jaw-dropping, jaw-crushing, you name it. From the moment I first the album's first track, I felt like my headphones just sandwiched my skull in. This is what I love about Unearth, the ferocity of hardcore with the technicality of metalcore. While I personally would have preferred screaming vocals that weren't ""typical sounding"", it's still a pretty solid album. As you might have heard, you should believe it, this album has some awesome breakdowns. Some of the best you'll hear in a LONG while. This band's second effort ""The Oncoming Storm"" is really good...it's also starting to go down that boring sea of metalcore rubbish but they still stand out among the rest."
3,Different kind of pregnancy book,"This is worth reading if you are pregnant simply because it is very unique among typical pregnancy books - however, the author is a very negative person and a lot of the book is her complaining about anything and everything (granted, it is her journal, but enough already)! It got a little old. But, it's a quick read and offered interesting similarities to my own pregnancy (example - her baby always quieted down when her husband has his hand on her stomach - we thought it was just our kiddo). I was disappointed that there weren't more pictures, since the ones included were very great."
2,"good photos, tedious text","This 'diary' seems contrived -- written for publication, rather than an honest chronicle of an unplanned, later-in-life pregnancy. The photos are excellent -- thoughtful and interesting. The self-indulgent whining that accompanies them is not."
4,"Not a perfect tape, but satisfying.","HALF-WITS HOLIDAY (1947) is sad, but excellent. The party scene is funny with it's pie fight, but the sad part is how Curly is sick. This is his last film. He turned in a good short, and did Moe and Larry. You will forget about Curly once the wild pie fight starts. A remake of HOI POLLOI (1935) and later remade as PIES AND GUYS (1958).HORSES COLLARS (1935) is bad because it's a western. Nothing even special. Forget this. One of my top ten least favorite shorts.HOW HIGH IS UP (1940)- A classic. The construction scenes are hilarious. ""Where do we start?"" ""On the 97th floor."" Too many great scenes to discribe. A Must-see."
3,Soundtrack,The Masters of the Universe soundtrack was excellent but it lacked originallity. It sounded like the Star Wars and Back to the Future music.
5,Goddess of Music,Cesaria Evora is undoubtedly one of the greatest singers of all time! Her voice and style of singing are truly universal and transcendent. No one who listens to her will remain unaffected: It is impossible to withstand the power of her music. A gift such as hers is very rare and should be honored accordingly. This CD is highly recommended!
5,Wonderfully soothing...,She takes you to a journey of another world and place where you'd only dream of going...
1,Defective CD,"Good music from Evora as expected. But because the CD was defective, it's so annoying listening to the music that I just not playing it after the first time. And I just do not have the time to return it just for a small amount of money."
5,Rex Smith,"What a wonderful singer. His voice sure is beautiful. I love the ballads. I really enjoy listening to him sing in the Pirates of Penzance, but any song will do with this man. He's very talented and has such control with his voice. This cd is certainly a pleasure to own."
5,Sooner or Later,"I have loved Rex Smith ever since i saw him in a film called ""Sooner or Later"" when I was nine. I remember buying the 45 of ""You Take My Breath Away"" and listening to it at nauseum. I always thought he was gorgeous and still think he looks great at age 51!He has an amazing range, It's really too bad that he's out of the music business now. My favorite songs on the CD are ""You Take My Breath Away"", ""Sooner or Later"", ""Simply Jessie"", ""Oh, What a Night For Romance"" and ""Better Than It's Ever Been Before"". I can picture every scene in the movie when I listen to these songs. I wish that it included ""Shades of Blue"" but it doesn't.I've really enjoyed listening to this CD--it brings back lots of great memories. Some of the songs on the CD are a little too disco for me (and I grew up in the 70's!) but overall I am very pleased with my purchase!"
1,"Looks nice, quality stinks.","I should have learned the first two times I bought Spirit of St. Louis products. I had two different phones that failed within a year or so. I bought this, and I could tell the sound would not be spectacular, but the cassette section failed in less than seven months. The AM/FM tuner has awful distortion and the sensitivity of a New Jersey housewife. I will NEVER buy SOSL products again."
3,Look Elsewhere,"Unlike the other review, I find the sound quality pretty good. I've had it for about six years but I've had to send it back to the distributor for repairs to the CD player, once and now, within three years and with not very frequent use, the CD player is acting up again. The box is great, the components are cheap."
2,Not Enjoyable!,"I know it's very possibly MY taste buds, but this tastes like soap to me (or worse). It also leaves a nasty coating on the roof of my mouth (like grease), so it's not a very pleasant experience. I enjoy having a health bar with coffee at work sometimes for breakfast, but ironically I found this bar doesn't taste nearly so bad if you have it on it's own - but tastes MUCH worse with a beverage. I really liked the idea of this health energy bar, but the reality was NOT good."
2,Not Great,"Definitely by far not the best-tasting energy bar out there. As far as nutrition, since that information is readily available, there's little point in putting it in a review.I'd look elsewhere if you're looking for one that tastes good."
2,I bought these from Amazon,I bought these because they were at a great sale price. I really did not like them. Not a lot of flavor and they really don't curb your snack craving.
2,Unpleasant Taste & Texture - Flaky,"I keep a drawer full of breakfast bars that I eat twice a day and have tried dozens of varieties. I'd rank these as the second worst I've ever had. There are other flavors of Zoe's bars that I like better but this flavor tastes really fake (and my grandson agrees). Furthermore, they flake when I try to eat them such that I can't eat them at my desk without getting my lap and everything on my desk covered with pieces of the bar.For better options, try Clif Zbars for kids (just the right size for a snack) and Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies (huge and filling)."
2,Just ok...,I bought these on impulse as they were on sale. Very disappointed in the flavor and texture. My mouth felt dryer and dryer the more i chewed and i could barely swallow it. These will go to the food bank where i hope someone will benefit from them. Will not purchase again.
4,Good - but not the best bar I've ever had,"We really liked these bars a lot, but they do still have the vitamin fortified taste. All in all I would buy them again and my kids love them."
3,"Great value, good nutrition","But the taste is not great. Certainly edible, but the peanut butter bar (I bought both peanut butter and chocolate peanut butter flavors, and this one is esentially a peanut butter bar dipped in chocolate) has a slightly bitter taste. I'll certainly eat them but wouldn't buy again."
1,EZ Reads - Sleazy Binding,"This review is about the EZ Reads binding, not the novel.The Devils is one of the monuments of world literature. Anybody who appreciates it would want a copy which is a pleasure to hold and read through a long life. EZ Reads has produced a monumentally tacky binding for it, which does not justify the price ($35.71 when I bought it). I'm sending it back. I'll keep looking in used book stores, and I will never buy another title from this publisher.Caveat emptor."
2,The Possessed (The Devils),Found the book hard to read and after reading it for about the first 30% I decided that i will attempt to read it another time.
3,censored versions,"I guess it must be the zero price tag on kindle editions of this book that I have checked out. None of these contain the crucial chapter ""Stavrogin's Confession,"" which should follow the chapter ""At Tikhon's."" I guess the prudish translator Constance Garnettt decided to follow the example of Russian repression and omit this chapter. Several other editions have included the chapter as an appendix. Personally, I recommend (if you can find it) Andrew R. MacAndrew's translation, which I think was published by Signet Books paperback in the 1970's. I hope it shows up on kindle. Mac Andrew's translation restores this controversial chapter to its proper place. That is to say where FD intended it to be. It is a shame that a great novel continues to be censored and mutilated to the present day."
5,My daughter loves this pendant,"My daughter wears this pendant on a box chain necklace all the time, and she absolutely loves it. Great quality, especially for the price."
2,Nothing exciting,"Another plain dragging story of a powerful girl. When will these stereotypes end?! It's so sickening to read of another magical girl who gets powers out of nowhere. I want to read something new, fresh, and exciting."
4,"same book as ""On Her Majesty's Wizardly Service""","Very good book! I had looked forward to it for a long time. From Ms. Duane's website, I'd gotten the impression that it was the third book after ""Book of Night with Moon"" and ""On Her Majesty's Wizardly Service"". Have you ever saved an anticipated book carefully for the perfect time, only to open it up and discover that you've already read it? These are the same book under different titles, unfortunately. Apart from that, I recommend it."
4,The Sequel...,"Well, I must say that Diane Duane's done it again. But hey, it's a sequel and whenever I read it I'm comparing it in my head to the first book. The cat trio go to London and are met up with the team there. Basically, it's the usual cats save world story. Along with some interesting personal details on each of their lives that is reminiscent of our own lives and have all to do with the end of the story. Arhu meets someone who looks awfully familiar... And has Rhiow finally found love? Read it and find out."
3,CD doesn't do great singer justice,"David Daniels is one of the world's great countertenors -- I've seen him in person twice and can vouch for that -- but you wouldn't know it from this recording. Voice on this CD has a grating quality, plus there is a mechanical malfunction that causes the disk to begin making weird sounds and skip in the second half. The latter problem is no doubt peculiar to one particular disc and not true of the other discs of the same title."
1,GIVE THIS TO SOMEONE IN JAIL!!!,"If you want someone to stay behind bars, but keep them occupied, then this is the saw for them!! Not only will it make a wonderful stocking stuffer, they'll be sawing away at the bars for at least the rest of their lives!!It's the perfect saw for hacking your way through boiled noodles and maybe grandma's Christmas fruitcake, but little else. If you try to saw any wood with it, the blade stops and starts like teaching a newbie how to drive stick-shift.I must admit, I haven't tried the metal cutting blade, but that's because I can't get the wood blade out of the socket of the saw yet.Ladies, don't buy it....trust me.Fugget-about it..."
3,Good for small jobs,Bought this item because it seemed useful and was on the required tool list for my job. It is great for cutting ceiling tile and less dense material. Bends at the touch to sheat rock. Half the stuff it says it should cut I wouldn't use it for. The blades are very flimsey. Like I said. If you want a light tool that can cut ceiling tile or similar matierial and fits easily into your tool belt than this is it. Otherwise get an actual sheat rock knife or a hacksaw.
3,Superb music let down by horrendous production,"Art Farmer is one of my personal gods, and when he's joined by the dream rhythm section of cedar walton, ron carter and billy higgins all on top form, the music doesn't disappoint. However my DVD skips all over the place, and has awful cuts. I wrote to the manufacturer, but no reply - so I guess they don't really care. A tragedy to treat timeless classic music in this manner.Having said this, the music is essential so has to be heard (get the video perhaps?)"
4,Holds 500 rounds of 9mm on 5.56 stripper clips,"As the title states, this box will hold 500 rounds of 9mm ammo neatly stacked on 30-round stripper clips. I gave the box 4/5 stars because it tapers from top to bottom, making for an odd shape (unlike previous generation of Otters or the current Pelican cases). I have had no issue with water resistance, but I also don't store the case underwater. The company is awesome, 5/5 stars for service and support-- they responded quickly and replaced two items that broke on me in the past (lid latch that snapped after seizing in place and a cellphone belt clip from their Defender case that broke when it fell off a firetruck!). The cases have a thin foam lining, cuts down on noise and offers some bump resistance. Will definitely buy more to store ammo and gun parts. Good stuff!"
4,Nice little box,"The Otterbox Drybox 3500 is pretty nice. Is it waterproof? Probably for rain, but probably not if it went over the side of a boat, for example. But in general, it is a nice storage system for things like ammo and batteries. One caveat: the hinges are plastic with a steel pin inserted... I imagine that not too much force would be required to break the hinges off of the lid. And it's made in China (but most things are these days... go figure). Overall, not bad."
5,"Great case, but...","OtterBox waterproof cases are the industry standard. I purchased this one in conjunction with a Canon PowerShot SX20IS so that I could take my camera on a river trip. Unfortunately, even though the case was listed under ""people who bought this (camera) also bought..."", THIS CASE IS TOO SMALL for the SX20IS."
5,Great Cookbook focusing on Fruit and Vegetable Recipes!!,"I love this cookbook. I have had it for over ten years. It has the following sections: Appetizers, Soups, Quick Breads, Salads and Relishes, Vegetables, Main Courses and Desserts. It has great fruit pie recipes. The Blueberry Pie, Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie, Raspberry and Cream Pie, and Apple Pie are some all time favorites. The Broccoli Quiche is delicious as is the Double Corn Muffins. Most recipes have a comment from the author which I always enjoy. I highly recommend this cookbook. I got mine directly from the Wilson Farm Stand in Massachusetts."
3,read the insructions and clear your memory ...!!!!!!,"If you are crashing....Music Maker Deluxe is my secret weapon, Music Maker Deluxe 2004 (MMD 2004) coupled with 2 other programs I currently use, are proving to be a winning combination for me. Those who have listened to the beats I am pounding out using MMD 2004 are astonished by the layered arrangements and effects this program gave me. Anyone out there who builds beats from scratch and limits their sampling would be impressed with this application. The virtual instruments are cool......bottom line!!!! Even the sampling savy ""beat pirates"" out there would enjoy this program. It works on my vaio buddy.....LOL The people that will have problems with this program don't read instructions and have too much porn saved to their hard-drive!!!!!!! I'm out"
1,Does Not Function Properly - No Customer Service,"Product does not fold back properly on itself. There are hook & loop straps to hold product when folded for carrying, but there is a lot of stress on the straps and product still stays open by 6-8"" when folded. Perhaps is a mfg defect, but appears more to be a design flaw and product does not work as indicated. Called Crazy Creek directly about this well within their listed office hours. No one answered their customer service line, but did leave a recorded message with my name and phone number. No one from Crazy Creek called me back, so I am returning the unit."
1,Horrified!,"Being the dog lover I am, and living with two amazing border collies, I had high HOPES for this book. However, after getting only to page 44, I felt sick and horrified! I couldn't believe I was actually reading this. This is by far the worst book I can remember, and I will not spend anymore time discussing it. My only hope is that I can save someone else from wasting time and dealing with such agony."
5,A lasting Memory,This is the first book I recommend to any other dog lover. And my list is a long one. But this one is my favorite contemporary dog novel. It created a lasting memory for me. I was swept up into the story and could not put it down until I had finished
5,My Very Favorite Book!,"Best book ever! Nop's Hope is excellent too! If you love a dog, this book will make you cry, but it is excellent!"
3,Dark dog story,"Readers of dog stories expect heartbreak in the end, and are prepared for it. However, this story is infused with darkness and brutality nearly from the beginning. Too much so for me, and definitely NOT appropriate for children."
5,The Watership Down of Border Collie stories!!,"We have two Border Collies, so we know more about the breed than the average bears. But when a neighbor insisted I read Nop's Trials, I cringed thinking of all the other unread books on my special shelf reserved for, well, not-yet-read books. Trust me, if you like sappy stories, you'll be hooked from minute one. A great, quick read. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Nop will become part of you."
4,For the GG Allin fan,"Banned in Boston part 2 is a good album, assuming you're already a fan of GG Allin. If you're new to GG Allin, then check out a different album of his before going to this one. Most of the songs, while sung with the familar GG Allin attitude, sound more vintage than some of his other albums. If you're not only new to GG Allin, but also new to punk rock, start some where else. While the songs are good, there's not much to the album, and many of the songs are of very low recording quality; don't expect to listen to them easily on headphones. If you are a GG Allin fan however, I highly suggest you get around to obtaining this album. It's slightly different than GG's other works and should prove to be enjoyable to the GG Allin fan out there."
2,Misleading photo (corrected),"The photo on this item is very misleading. The picture shows a ratcheting cargo bar, but the item in question is a telescoping bar. The ratcheting bar would be much better than the telescoping.The bar you receive has preset stop holes, and then you have to screw the feet out from there to adjust the tension. Its not as easy, quick, or secure as a ratcheting bar.7/11/2007 - It appears the photo has been updated. I'm still using the bar, however it has rusted severely. I'm now in the market for a new one."
1,Custom fit my ...,"I waited extra time for these custom fit seat covers but when I received they weren't even close to fitting my truck nor anything Dodge has made in the past 30 years. Also the fabric is cheat and already had snags all over it when I took the covers out of the box. Just stay away from this sub par product, you will be much happier. These seat covers don't come close to the standards I've come to expect from Amazon."
3,Alias -,"For as long as he can remember, fifteen year old Toby Chase's home has been the old car his mom is driving to yet another new life in a new city. Just when Toby gets settled, they pack up and move on. After settling in the remote Idaho community of Donner, Toby's mother promises him that it will be better than any place they have ever lived, and it is. Toby's happy and his mother is too. While doing research on the Internet for a school research project about the Vietnam War, Toby discovers the truth about his mother; she is a fugitive. Will Toby reveal his knowledge? Will he again have to move? Has his dream of a real home once again been shattered?Ryan has written a suspenseful fast paced story. The characters are well developed which makes the reader care all the more about Toby, his mother and the friends they have made in Donner. Some tense moments lead up to the story's conclusion. A few minor flaws exist, but can be easily overlooked. An enjoyable work that teens will enjoy."
4,It was wonderful!,"This book was great. The last few pages were kinda cluttered with information as she tried to bring the closing to a smooth halt, but it all worked out nicely. I enjoyed it, and hope she has more books coming out soon."
4,Ambient mastery shrouded in darkness,"Burzum is a now infamous old black metal band, headed by the equally legendary Varg Vikernes.This early album contains pieces of music similar to the black metal of the day, every instrument radiating a sort of hatred and evil the first bands tried to capture. However there are many pieces similar to Burzum's later work, ambient and artistic.The vocals are inadible screams. The guitars slowly change and morph riffs into deeper and darker sounds than they originally were. This creates a very atmospheric work of music, different than the more brutal bands like darkthrone or marduk, but the climate alone on this cd gives it a place in black metal music history."
2,Not Very Memorable.,"I'm a fan of Burzum, but this album is the one that just does not grasp me. Almost all of Burzum material is alot of noise, but the songs on this record just seems like alot of senseless noise. An effort, but not as good as his self-titled debut or Hvis Lyset Tar Oss."
3,Great guitar-centric but still 'electronic' tunes,Jonny Marr's guitar is all over all of these tracks and it adds a nice dynamic sound to the synths. The lyrics are pushed back in the mix and a sometimes substantial reverb is placed at the front. The tracks might be a tad too long.Its a great sounding CD if you already like New Order and Electronic.
3,SOMETHING'S HAPPENIN'-- IT'S DISTRACTING,"Despite the fact that this album sounds more original than the other Electronic albums, I don't think this is the best these talented guys can do. I also feel that while this has original moments, it suffers an overlong death of sameness. I absolutely fell in love with the aggressive and challenging ""Make it Happen"", the first track, but while the rest is very pleasant and very listenable, it just isn't striking. I bought this album in summer, 1999 when it was not yet available in the U.S. and listened to it quite a bit and found that apart from the first track this album cannot be listened to song by song. You have to listen to it all the way through for any effect at all, and even that is negligible. These CD seems to go in all kinds of different directions and just isn't quite as satisfying as I had hoped."
4,Finding Their Own Voice,"The problem with side-projects is that there's always an original, usually better, band dodging your every step. Electronic has been doubly cursed because of Bernard Sumner's New Order and Jonny Marr's The Smiths (triply cursed if you count Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant's contributions at the beginning). While Twisted Tenderness isn't the equal of, say, New Order's Brotherhood or The Smith's Louder Than Bombs, it's certainly better than Republic or Strangeways, Here We Come, and it marks the point where Electronic finds their own voice. For the most past, that voice consists of a rockier dance sound than anything New Order ever attempted, and some of Marr's best guitar work since the demise of The Smiths. Good enough for now."
5,EXcellent All the Way Through!,"Nice packaging but bonus material is nothing outstanding, HOWEVER, read my review below and just buy the US bonus tracks original album:This is far and away one of the best albums I own, and that Sumner/Marr have made together, or apart, for that matter. Strong songs all the way through. Especially love Prodigal Son - screaming DRUMS as well as guitar. I love New Order, and while Raise the Pressure is listenable but not great, and while their first album Electronic was brilliant in spots, but patchy overall, Twisted Tenderness is just incredible all the way through - excellent musicianship, production, and modern rocking sound! Better than anything New Order has ever done, and of course nothing like/and cannot touch The Smiths - highly recommneded by a music lover who DOES NOT download."
2,Schizophrenic! Big time,"I don't have a whole lot of the Tokens in my library. The two discs that I own are the RCA 1994 compilation ""THE BEST OF"" and the Varese Sarabande 2004 compilation ""THE VERY BEST OF 1964-1967"". I must say I am quite fond of this folk group.As this CD includes the ablum ""It's a happening world"" and 11 bonus tracks, it's a very generous offering. But to listen to the whole CD from the beginning to the end is a rather excruciating and schizophrenic experience. One minute it's folk, next minute it's sunshine/Baroque pop or surf rock. Similarly, the vocal harmony often switches from four-part folk-rock to multi-layer Beach Boy and/or the late Beatles without any warning. Track 17 ""Animal"" is a great example of what goes wrong: the group is trying so very hard to sound ""hip"", it ends up sounding like a caricature of themselves."
5,Seasons of the Heart,Passionate and Sincere. What some of us spend our whole lives looking for but rarely find. Ghoncheh's talent and faith are undeniable.
5,GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTT,"This is absolutely the best way to warm up your arm. It makes a baseball or softball feel like a feather. It works great as a dog toy as well. My dog is so destructive on other dog toys, but not this. :)"
3,should be called a low chair,"This chair is nice looking and seems to be of good quality. It was very easy to assemble. We were very surprised, however, once we assembled the chair to find that it is very short, about the size of a regular dining room chair. I guess this is nice if you plan on pulling it up to the table for dinners, however it is a little shorter than we would like for feedings. The other negative is that my seven month old is constantly slipping down and I am afraid he is going to fall out. Knowing what I know now I might shop around a little bit more if I could do it over again. The chair works well enough that we won't need to replace it. Great price and good looking, but not quite what we hoped for."
4,Walls of Jericho - A Day and a Thousand Years,"In the tradition of super-fast, abrasive hardcore, Walls of Jericho is at the top. Packed with high-energy beats, and those always pleasing abrupt starts and stops, it's the perfect album with which to feed, or purge some agression. The best part, though, is the vocals. Candace (the lead singer) has a voice and style unheard of among female performers of today, and if you ever get a chance to see them live, you'll be even more convinced of this. Save for the fact that they have a female singer, though, Walls of Jericho doesn't do a lot that's ""progressive"" or ""origional"" like you see with bands like Botch or Refused. Overall, though, this album is a necessary part of anyone's hardcore library."
2,"Fine, but nothing particularly new or conclusive.","This book brings together many of the recent publications concerning the volatility surface. The work is interesting and points out many of the well known problems with pricing options in a non Black Scholes world. As is often the case with financial literature, it is more interesting from an academic perspective than from a practical one."
3,French scouts,"Often funny, although sometimes too obvious.Cumulates all good and bad aspects of scoutism, but mainly bad aspects.By the way, when will French have all of their movies systematically subtitled in English?"
1,I wasted my money,"""Just Can't Cut It: Quilts from Fabulous Fabrics""This book is an insult to any quilter, even the most beginning quilter will not find it a help.The fact that it was published amazes me!"
1,Doesn't Deliver Quality,"This was a much anticipated gift, and after it was opened and used to play records off and on during the evening, the turntable would slow down and speed up and is totally useless for playing records - the entire reason this was purchased.We received a replacement unit and it was also defective so it was sent back as well. I would not recommend at all, the motor goes out and does not control the speed of the turntable. I am surprised it is still being offered for sale."
2,meh.,"I'd describe the models as tall, handsome women. The setting appears to be a series of photo-shoots, and as a result the ladies are mostly acting as statues. Some of the models appear only very briefly. I can't remember much else about it."
2,Not enough skin!!!,"Look, if you are going to make something with the title ""Nude"" in it, then you should go all the way. Cinimax or Showtime have better action at late night."
4,one hand won't do it,"I purchased the FlipKlip when I broke my right arm and was having trouble holding a book open with just my left hand. My left hand is not my dominant hand and isn't in very good shape. Paperbacks that have no margin on the spine side are the worst.Yes it works and doesn't tear the page. I put cornstarch on the rubber page holders as they held the page too firmly to slip out and in easily, it helped very much.All that being said, I don't really use it that much. It is a bit clumsy when you are reading a paperback and only have the use of one hand. I am a fast reader and fumbling around slipping pages out from under the holder and then back under the other holder was slow.Better than nothing for some books, however. It would work very well for a cookbook, which of course is it's intended use.I'm keeping my FlipKlip on my cookbook shelf, and I'm glad I bought it"
5,Great little Book holder,"I lost a book holder that I had and was looking for a replacement. I needed something to hold my books open while on the StairMaster at the gym. While a little pricey for a plastic item, it more than fit the bill. It takes up almost no room in my gym bag and it works like a charm. It's called a cook book holder, but it's way more versatile than that. Too bad that Amazon doesn't stock this item so that it could qualify for free shipping."
4,Hands-free at last!!,"This was a very welcome product for me to see become available! It holds the pages for you so you can do some other thing (for me it's knitting!) while you catch up on that reading that just doesn't get done otherwise. (I suppose it would also work on a magazine, e.g. on a windy day, but I haven't tried that.) The holder is very compact and easy to carry in pocket or purse. The only problem I found was that the pages are somewhat difficult to turn and to catch on the other side. However, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages and I think it is well worth the purchase!!"
1,Much better personal lubricants available,"Try slipper stuff and my all time fav, uberlube if you are looking for a lubricant that will not leave you sticky as this one will."
3,Just ok.,"I was expecting more of a slippery lube but this just seemed gummy and got sticky fast. Better than KY but not great. Also, it stinks and is a pain to clean up."
1,better than nothing,"I really am glad to see so many lubricants readily available on the market, Astroglide is one that can be found almost anywhere and at a very reasonable price.It's thick, a bit much in my opinion, but it holds up. The big issue that I have is that it must be thoroughly washed off afterwards. I have sensitivity to so many things and even at first I had no problem, but it developed and can cause an itching and burning until compltetly rinsed off - sometimes that can be a hassle. Just a warning. Even if it is water based, there can be other chemicals or ingredients that a person can develop a sensitivity to.Contains glycerin which is frequently a cause for irritation, makes it taste better but not worth the ensuing problems.Contains parabens which are known cancer causing agents.Go natural with ingredients, carefully and informed."
4,Works great. Water soluble. Not messy. Really natural....,Works great. Water soluble. Not messy. Really natural.
1,Wrong!,"I ordered Astroglide personal Lube. It was even shown in the 5 oz. tall bottle. What I recieved was Astroglide Gel in squeeze bottles. Not what I ordered. Not what I wanted. I didn't want to go through all the headache of sending them back, so I gave them away. Next time I will be more careful where I order from.Mark Porada"
4,Really sticky and extremely dry,"I don't know how this works for intercourse, but for masturebation it's extremely dry and doesn't last long at all. Any one who disagrees with this clearly has a different product and has never tried a great lube such as Liquid Silk."
2,Maybe its just me,"I am biased to the natural thing. I have been subject to this out of necessity and have decided that excessive natural lubrication (saliva) is a better method than any. My GF and I used both silicon and Astro before deciding that nice breaks in between was a better solution than either. If I had to chose I would say go with Silicon and wash well after, but if you can avoid them then avoid them both. The dry feeling that is felt after is unbearable. If you go long periods of time and you absolutely need lubricant, go silicon. I have limited astro to infrequent and small drops.Astro ProsNo silicon less infectionsNatural feelingAstro NegativesDoesnt last longwinds up feeling more dry than before applied"
5,Best Lube Ever!,"I've tried several different lubes (including KY and I-D Glide) and I have to say, AstroGlide is my favorite.It has basically no odor whatsoever (other lubes sometimes have a nasty, putrid odor), which is nice. It is extremely slick and feels great on your skin (especially the hands, I've had problems with other lubes leaving my hands feeling sticky and uncomfortable even after washing them, but not with AstroGlide). It feels very life-like if you catch my drift, when combined with certain ""toys""...It's just a great, quality product overall.I dunno, AstroGlide is easily the best lube I've ever used. It's slightly more expensive than others, but it's worth it."
5,Great Lube,"Wow!!! This astroglide is super smooth. Just a few drops works great. No drag, no pull, use sparingly. Would strongly recommend."
5,Excellent service,I have purchased Astroglide numerous times from HerbalLoveShack. They've always delivered exactly what I ordered promptly. Their price beats everybody else's
3,lubricant,Its very slick and it works better than vagisil but it does dry up fairly quickly when using the fleshlight. If you wet it with water it slicks right back up. Also its very sticky after it begins to dry. Im not experenced with lubricants so I cant really compare it or say how good or bad it is
1,I don't like this lube at all.,It gets stringy with use and has a bitter taste. Try ID Glide instead.
4,Stuff works!,What can one say but it feels so good. but then the activity that goes with it always feels good.
3,Not the Worst not the Best,"Take an average of the existing reviews and I'd say you have a pretty good description of this lube.It is clean, provides good lubrication, but is watery and seems to dry sooner than you'd expect..or want. So ""when the moment is right"" (hmmm that might be another product), and you don't mind dealing with those issues, reach for the Astroglide."
3,dont last long,This is ok but it does not last long depending on how much is used. No smell and does not leave a oil or residue stain.
4,Hard to control cap,Great lube park a humvee in the space for a Volkswagen works good. But the cap is hard to control.and snap back on
5,Complete Works of Josephus,It is a very complete book - will truly take a long time to digest the information. I am very happy for your service.
3,hard to understand,"I have not read too much of the book to be honest. I think it's very informative, but its a lot to read."
1,too difficult to read,"Having just returned from a trip to Israel, Egypt and Jordan I was most anxious to read the Complete Works of Josephus. Obviously his writings are the best source for understanding ancient times. Unfortunately I had to return the book because the print was so small that it was impossible to read. I realize that there was a tremendous amount of material to be covered but they should have thought of a better way to present it."
4,"a good manual,good for beginers and has good information","this is a very good book for begineers and might help a middle leval pigeon fancier. has a lot on feed,sicknesses,and care.well worth the money.I'm a beginer and it helped me.has a good list of books and has very good photos of Foy's Pigeon Farms. a good all around book. espiecilly for me(a 11 year old)sice I don't have ton's of money to spend. done by Daniel A. Jacobs age 11"
5,great book,this book is very sweet and would be great to give to any mother for mothers day. Robert Munsch is a wonderful author.
5,Excellent book!!!,"I bought this book because it had good reviews, it's an awesome book for little kids. I was reading the book to my daughter the first time and I tried really hard not to cry at the end, it's just such a good book. So the second time my daughter asked me to read this book, I asked my husband to do it (I didn't tell him what the book was about), and when he was reading it, I heard his voice cracking at the end. It was an unexpected end for both of us. I recommend you buy this book for your kids. You will love it!."
2,simply pathetic,"this review is about the english version, though relevant to the spanish as well. we finally remembered to donate it to the salvation army so we would no longer have to read it to our child. pure sap. c'mon, the elderly mother drives to her grown son's house, scales a ladder to his room and rocks him back and forth, back and forth...touching? creepy! read it at the library before spending the cash!"
5,i cry,"when i was a little boy my mom used to read this tome and it allways made me cry because the mom was sick and to this day it still makes me cry and now im 15. so this is one of my favorite books and i will read it to mi child and he/she will read it to there child. it makes me think about the way i treat my mother. well all i have to say is ""i'll love you for ever, i'll like you for alway, as long as i'm living my mommy you'll be"" i love you mom"
3,Your typical western...,"Ex-Texas Ranger (Johnny Canavan) versus the gunthrowers. Well-written fiction that's very easy to read. I grinned a few times with the subplot of the story: Canavan dealing with the demands of the female, Ardis Lundy. The paperback is worth your time, good way to spend a few relaxing hours."
5,Gripping and insightful,"I think there is a macabe side to all of us. Whenever we hear of a suicide, the first question we ask is always why? But do we really want to know? Do we really want to hear what pushed someone to the brink, to do the unthinkable? ""I'm in the Tub Gone"" is exactly that. A look at the last thoughts of those who chose to end it all and move past whatever it was that drove them there. Some of the notes are truly sad and crying out for help. Its a shame that their loved ones missed the signs. There are others that are vengeful and mean spirited and are the ultimate act of revenge. Regardless, the book is powerful and gripping and yet at the same time deeply disturbing. Its overall effect is to give us an upclose look at something we really didnt want to see. Is it worth reading? Yes but remember, its not something you will be able to simply put down and forget either."
5,Good movie,I never got to see this one as a teen. Loved the show. I will watch this dvd over and over
5,Night of Dark Shadows,"While the majority of the cast from the TV soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" was off filming ""House of Dark Shadows"", other members of the crew remained back in the New York studio, keeping the story line going for three weeks. Dan Curtis gave this group their own movie outing in ""Night of Dark Shadows"". On the scale of having an over-abundance of chills and goose bumps to satisfy horror fans, this is one of those movies that will prey on your mind and remain there, and remain there....remain there....remain there....and maybe even make you think that you should look over your shoulder ""just in case""."
2,It was awful,Don't waste your Money I love all the Dark Shadows Just not this one it was Awful I wish I had not bought it.
3,Kind of disappointing if you are a Dark Shadows fan!,"Low budget movie unfortunately. I am a Dark Shadows fan, and it didn't go with the series well at all."
4,deserves restoration,"this film, even in its massacred form, is well worth seeing: if it is restored as it deserves to be, it will finally get the attention which it deserves."
3,Childhood memories of watching this movie return.,"One of the strangest and eerie movies of its time. This movie is a good movie, but don't expect to see the vampires or werewolfs. this deals more in witchcraft and curses. The ending will remind you of another classic movie when you see it."
2,I wonder If this Should Have been made?,This movie was so bad!It was cut to shreds in the cutting room.Its missing so many scenes that would have made it make scense.For Shadows fans only.I dont think anyone else would get it.
3,Hard-hitting dark horror classic,This movie goes two steps beyond the world created by the TV gothic horror soap opera. This is not a horro film that wraps up nicely. It hits hard and ends as many 1970s horror films did - in a dark fashion. This loosely-based sequel House of dark Shadows has the same dark and fore-boding feel as that one but the characters are not well-developed. David Selby plays his role well but the film does lack depth and interesting supporting characters.
1,"TV show yes, movies no.","I wasn't crazy about the first DS movie, but I thought I'd give this a shot. Now I'm sorry I did. About the only thing of interest here is the wonderful Grayson Hall, who looks glamourous as Carlotta. Everything else in the movie falls flat. I couldn't understand the story at all. ""Dark Shadows"" is/was a terrifically entertaining television series. Get the coffin box and indulge, but forget any ""Dark Shadows"" movies. They are all pretty lame."
3,Night of Dark Shadows,"As as Dark Shadows fan, I'm glad I purchased this movie to add to my collection.I bought a VHS tape as a DVD was not available. However, I feel the $35.00 I paid for this film is not worth the money."
2,Unwatchable,"This has to be the most unwatchable movie i have seen.So many scenes were cut out the movie makes no sense.I say wait for the re-release with the lost footage.There is a project going on,and they have put all the missing footage back together.So its only a matter of time when people can watch the film the way it was meant to be seen."
1,Smart People Sell Haunted Houses!,Whew. Saw this one on the big screen in 1971. Man...what a yawner! Who are these people and why would I care?The only thing going for this film is Lara Parker with the finest facial structure in the western hemisphere...as well as a good actress!Otherwise...fuhgeddabbouddit!
4,lesser known dark shadows movie is still good,"the only thing that would make this better would be the 20 plus ""lost minutes"" of the movie. rumor has it if the johnny depp remake would have made real money the footage would have been added. without it i still liked it but it jumps from different scenes to make it confusing."
2,"Beware, this won't be the director's cut.","For those hoping for the long anticipated restored ""Director's cut"" of this movie with the missing 30-35 added back in, your wait continues. I have read that this is the regular butchered theatrical release. Don't know why the first reviewer, Terry Richard, gave this 5 stars. Maybe he/she just likes to see his/her name in print and just gives out 5 star reviews across the board. To those who have seen this movie, you know that it is flawed after Dan Curtis chopped a half hour of footage from it. I will certainly pass on this one with the hope that someday, the full version will come out."
2,NOT UPDATED - completely outdated!,"Do not waste your time and money with this product. It has much better interface than 2002 or 2003 version, but as compared with Encarta 2004 or Concise Britannica (2002) it is completely outdated!Examples:- Encarta 2004 and Concise Britannica say that Mobil and Exxon are former names (companies) and that the new company is named Exxon Mobil Corp. (since 1999). But Britannica 2004 (Deluxe) says Mobil and Exxon are still independent companies (the last date mentioned is 1972 for Exxon and 1988 for Mobil).- Concise Britannica say that Merida, Mexico, had a population of 557,000 in 1990 (Encarta 2004: 705,000 in 2000). But Britannica 2004 (Deluxe) provides only an information for 1980(!) (i.e. 400,142)It would be nice if someone from Britannica can explain how is it possible that Concise Britannica from 2002 is more updated than Britannica 2004."
1,Poorly supported,"I am very diappointed with this product. It is extremely sluggish. Moreover, most of the text in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus in the Encyclopedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2004 DVD (2004.0) does not display correctly. I have tried to get help from Encyclopedia Britannica's online tech support and customer service for this product repeatedly but they do not respond. I cannot recommend software which Encyclopedia Britannica refuses to support. It is shameful that Encyclopedia Britannica will not support their product and will not respond their customers."
2,"Decent encyclopedia, lousy atlas, sluggish performance.","If you're thinking about upgrading from the 2003 version, don't bother. This one is equally slow (even when all of the files are fully installed on hard disks) and the content appears to be virtually the same. The interface is more attractive, but just as inefficient and difficult to use.The articles are well written, but fragmented and not as complete as one would hope.All in all, a disappointment. Judging from the other reviews on this page, that view is widely shared."
3,just okay,I thought this book was just okay. I stuck with it because I am a Trollope fan and would like to eventually read all of his works. This Kindle book was free on Amazon.com in the classics section. Free sure beats the price of Trollope books if you can even find them.
1,Total garbage.,"A short list of grievances:1. The earbuds don't fit well in the ear2. The retraction wheel is in the middle of the cord, so that if you're walking while listening to music, it bounces around and threatens to pull the buds out of your ears.3. The retraction wheel broke after a month, making these headphones no longer retractable.NOT WORTH THE MONEY YOU'LL SPEND ON SHIPPING, let alone the cost of the headphones. These headphones are garbage."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought these because they were cheap - and I guess you get what you pay for. I thought the sound was ok, but I almost always listen to podcasts or audio books, so I'm not that fussy. However, it had a couple other problems. The retracting mechanism stopped working in a very short time, and since this was one of the reasons I selected these, that was very disappointing. Also, the winding piece is too heavy, and doesn't have any kind of clip to hold it in place. It kept pulling the earbuds out of my ears. I ended up having to clip the lanyard from my mp3 player to it to hold it. I'd recommend trying something else."
3,let's get some decent track selection here please,"I LOVE Hybrid. I saw them live and it was the greatest electronica show I've seen. And for the most part, I like their remix work, as they basically break and scratch and add strings until the old song becomes virtually their own. But I have to draw the line at this album. The remix of Filter's ""Take My Picture"" is awful. As is ""Glorious."" And even Moby's indomitable ""Bodyrock"" suffers on this album. Plus, the entire mix opens with ""Unfinished Symphony,"" which is their most overplayed and overrated song in my opinion. Plus, it finishes weakly and without incident.There are wonderful tracks on this mix, BT's song is great, FSOL's ""Papua New Guinea"" never sounded better. And the hard-edged female vocals on ""Bad Girl"" are excellent.Is this worth buying? Maybe yes, if you're a big fan of the Hybrid sound like I am, maybe no if you're anything else."
3,Lasts one season,"I wish Teva would improve the mush flip flop. It compresses too quickly and by the end of the summer there is barely any cushion in the heel. The sole is too smooth as well. I have slipped once and had to be extra careful on wet surfaces. They are so comfortable, but at a price. Reef makes a better and more long lasting flip flop."
2,I prefer the Olowahu,"The sole is comfortable, but I prefer the Olowahu. It has the same sole, but I don't have to grip the thong with my toes, which is supposedly bad for your feet."
5,Fantastic,"I love these flipflops. I have a heel spur and plantar facilitis and these flipflops are thick enough to help me walk outside on a hard pavement of NYC without a problem. Get them, they are so comfortable and I got them in my fav colour, purple. Hope to buy more this summer and give them out to my family."
2,Just Okay,"After reading reviews and hearing a coworker rave about Teva Mush sandals, I hoped I would love these, but they did not feel as great as I anticipated. I have to send them back for a refund.On a brighter note, I bought Teva Elixer sandals. Flip flops with arch support! Awesome. Give them a try!"
5,"Teva Women's Mush Flip Flop, Spring Wedgewood","Love Love Love these flip flops, they conform to your foot, and are very comfortable to wear. These are the only ones I would wear shopping. I don't buy any other brand now."
2,OK for pedicure flip flops,"Bought the cheapest brand-name flip-flops Amazon had so that I can use them for pedicure sandals. They're OK for that, but highly uncomfortable. The footbed is flat, and it feels very difficult to keep them on the feet!"
5,Best sandals ever,"Normally I'm not a huge flip flop person and certainly not for walking a lot. But these are absolutely wonderful. I've had one pair for several years and have only just worn them out. I have walked across lava beds in these, so they are definitely sturdy. They mold to your feet beautifully after 15 minutes of walking or so and provide support and comfort even for fairly long days walking around. I generally hate toe thongs and they rub my feet raw, but that never happens with these even after walking all day in them. I can't recommend these enough. They are more comfortable than even the more expensive sturdier ones offered."
3,"Very comfy, but straps too long","When I first starting wearing these flip flops they were great, the best I ever owned. However, after wearing them for about a month and they are being broken in more the straps that go over the foot are a little long. I am a size 7.5 to an 8 (with usally being an 8) so I ordered the 8 and now wish I would have gone with a 7 instead. I don't know if the straps stretched or if they just feel bigger because the shoe is more broken in or if it is a combo of the two. Even though I am diappointed because they are not cheap, I still love the flip flops, I will just be sure to get a size 7 next time."
5,Love Tevas!,I own quite a few styles of Tevas and these are my favorites! The most comfortable flip flop ever and won't slip. I bought Reefs one time because I heard they were the same and they are not! I am back to Teva and won't ever buy Reefs again. Very comfortable- you can wear them all day. I have very flat feet so I need arch support but not too much or else my feet will hurt. Teva fits the bill perfectly.
4,Teva Flip Flops,"I love Teva flip flops and this one was no exception. I am disappointed that as years go by, Teva seems to be making the soles of this version thinner. That's no big deal in the grand scheme and does not affect it's performance or feel, but I miss the thicker version."
4,Definitely soft but not the best,"These would be great if I didn't compare them to Sanuk Yoga Mat. Here's how they compare. *nothing* compares to Sanuk Yoga Mat for squishy soft all-day comfort. These are definitely soft and comfy, but lack some of the underlying support that the Sanuk has under the soft. We need more quality like that."
1,Lack of heel cushion,"I've worn flip flops almost my whole life. Various kinds, expensive and cheap. I was super excited about getting my first pair of Mush flip flops. Love the design, the flip flops are cute & comfortable. But...when walking around in them, the heel part is not cushioned well. After wearing them for an hour I could feel the bottom sole design on my heels when I walked. Now I feel the design on the soles everytime I wear them. And the lack of heel cushion makes for almost no shock absorbtion when walking. If you're only going to be walking on sand, these will be fine. But if you're walking on side walks and around stores, I don't recommend these. Unfortunately these aren't made for normal daily use."
2,Arch support altered the look of my feet in them.,"The quality of the shoe is great, the sole comfortable, but the arch support altered the look of my feet in them & I returned them because of that feature."
3,A Good Pop Album,"I found Tommy's second post-Styx effort to be much like his first, ""GIRLS WITH GUNS."" It is chock full of good popular tunes with a middle-of-the-road feel. ""Reach for the Bottle"" is my favorite cut; its message is powerful. This CD is a must for serious Tommy Shaw collectors, but not for you if you're expecting folk music or hard driving rock."
1,What If?,What If Tommy Shaw Didn't Make Everything He Does Sound The Same. What If Tommy Shaw Didn't Turn Styx Into A Damn Yankees Soundalike.
1,Not a profesional pry bar,"I am a general contractor / Carpenter, and I bought this pry bar for work. Its okay for most applications, but the fulcrum on the flat end is positioned so far out, that you don't get enough leverage for any serious prying (like prying two boards apart that are nailed together)."
4,Curves in all the right places!,"This pry bar is a good shape for, well, prying! The curve pushes the bar out far enough to get some leverage. I like the bright yellow tip that helps keep it from getting lost in darker environments.I haven't found mine to be especially sharp. It is intended for smaller jobs, and works well for those. It isn't a problem unless you are demolishing a house with it. Just something to be aware of."
4,Very genuine and insightful story-telling,"This book appealled to me on several levels due to the fact that I am both a sea-going serviceman and a budding author. I actually bought it for entertainment during my last patrol. I found that a lot of the events and opinions related closely to my own. It is full of action packed, funny, and violent stories of hope, freedom, and honor."
5,Girls With Guns---Terrific!,"Received quickly. CD in perfect condition. No problems, no complaints. Thank you!!! jeanne"
5,GOOD TOMMY SHAW CD,THIS WAS A GREAT CD FROM THE TALENTED GUITARIST OF STYX.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.GREAT ROCK MUSIC.FIVE STARS ABSOLUTELY.
5,One of the Best Albums ever,"This is absolutely one of the best albums ever. Tommy Shaw took all the angst from Styx (read Dennis DeYoung) and created some of the most soul searching music ever. I still have this album but would give a body part to find the CD. Incredible lyrics, fantastic guitar and amazing melody create one of the best music experiences of the 80's"
3,"good album, badly produced though","Tommy chose produce: Mike Stone (of Asia fame).Bad choice, very echoey sounding, ""thin"". I wish he had just re-produced this himself. He went on a year latet to produce his 2nd album ""What If"" and it is 100% better.The sounds here are good, nothing really excellent. Not a bad album and worth buying.For better Tommy Shaw, get ""what if"" and ""Ambition"", far superior albums, but agian, this one aint too shabby."
4,-=- There's Something Sexy About Girls With Guns -=-,"This is Tommy Shaw's first solo release after he initially departed the band Styx. The music is very 80s, but good 80s. All of the songs are pretty good, if you are a fan of Shaw or what he did with Styx. If you are not a Styx or Tommy fan, you might not like some of the songs here. The title song is the most known song from this release. The video that was released in 1984 when this first came out was a continuous shot, with no cuts, after the initial video was canned because Tommy thought that it was not really him. The album has a couple of ballads that are decent. The CD was out of print for a while, so I would suggest getting it if you are a fan."
4,Excellent Re-Issue,"Recently, this cd was on E-bay for at least $60-$200.00 for ""die-hard"" Tommy Shaw plans. There was a cry to reissue, which was recently done. The title track, ""Girls with Guns,"" is an excellent showcase for Tommy's voice and his ""will to rock"", which in my opinion of reading many articles about him feeling ""stifled"" in ""STYK"" for not being able to be as creative as he'd like. ""Lonely School"" is another great song. You can really feel that he had a blast making this album. And although it's 24 years old, the sound is great and definitley a must for any ""Tommy Shaw"" fan."
3,tiny!,"It's my fault for not reading the information. I assumed it was a toy that my kid could push around the house, but it's a tiny model that you have to put together and paint yourself. It's great if that;s what you're looking for. I'll hold onto it for 10 years or so until my kid is able to do that sort of thing."
5,Valentine Legacy,I have look for five years to get this book in hard cover and finally found it. This was the first time that I have ever used Amazon to buy anything. Great experience!
1,Terrible,"What happens when a good premise ends up in the hands of a bad writer? This book sums it up. Childish is the best way to describe the writing. On the one hand, it's very ""Dick and Jane"" in many respects. On the other hand, the adult characters were written as if they were 8-12 years old in adult bodies. Naive is one thing, but many of the characters seemed as if they were arrested in childhood. The dialog is clunky and yet too simplistic. No emotional depth. Having read a lot of historical romance of this society, I can also say that a lot of the societal norms were missed entirely which makes the research suspect as well. Don't waste your money on this two-dimensional ""prose""."
3,"It was ""okay""","I'm not exactly sure why you people are ranting and raving so much about this book. I didn't think it was all that great. Sure, Jessie and James are cute and all, but the whole Blackbeard diary thing and the whole scene on the island with the treasure was corny. I think it would've been a much better story if CC would've left that whole part out. The rest of the book was cute. Catherine Coulter isn't my favorite author, though. I much prefer novels by Johanna Lindsey."
5,couldn't put it down,This is one of my most favorite books by Coulter. I have read it so many times that I had to get a new copy. I found Jessie endearing in her hilarious attempts to make herself into the kind of woman that James would notice. James is oblivious to her except as a racing appointent until fate strikes sending her fleeeing to England and his relatives. When James finds her she has been transformed from a tomboy to a beautiful woman. As they find eachother they also find a mystery that still haunts Jessie. This book has it all.
2,"Good story, dialogue needs work","While the story line was good (and fitted well with the previous 2 ""Legacy"" books), the dialogue was a bit on the sophomoric side. A bit insipid. Can't imagine grown adults really talking this way no matter what time period or locale they were from."
1,poor quality sewing,The workmanship in the sweatshirt was quite bad with an improperly cut pocket (left and right sides were a asymetrical). The emblem was also inproperly centered. I returned it and the company was great about processing my return.
3,It's not good enough,"Hybrid's remixing prior to the release of 'Wide Angle' promised wonders; but the album fails to deliver. Flashes of brilliance abound, but they've made too many mistakes for this to go down as an essential recording. The lovely pre-'Wide Angle' 'Symphony' has become a rather overblown 'Finished Symphony'; the same percussion set dominates every track; every last possible sonic gap is filled to the brim such that none of the music gets space to breathe; there are unmemorable vocals where there need not have been any (they're not Hybrid's strong point); and the whole thing feels chronically overproduced. I wanted to like this, but ultimately it's just all right, and no more."
3,Great post club / chillout album (CD 1 review),"There are so many CHillout compilation albums made by clubs like 'Minstry of Sound' on the market today and they are all poor. If you want good chillout you have to by individual artists albums like Fila Brazilia, Surya, Kid Loco, Lamb, Alex Reece, Bent, Faithless, Faze Action and this album by Hybrid.This is a good breakbeat/ dance album for relaxing. I only have cd1 so have only heard the first 12 tracks. Track 2 is easily the best and wouldn't sound out of place on Lamb's albums.Tracks 5 and 7 are also very good but these 3 tracks are the only ones that i find have an individual personality. The rest are pretty same-ish and eventually boring.Conclusion- a good album (for little money)."
2,Unlike fine wine...,"It doesn't age well with time. As others have said, the pomposity, sameyness and perfect cookie-cutter structure of the majority of the tracks from Wider Angle make for a hollow listening experience after you wipe away the fluff. There are few exceptions and this album becomes a pain to hear after repeated listens. Avoid it or you're rather liable to overdose."
2,SLEEPY TIME,"I PURCHASED THIS CD BECAUSE OF THE HIGH REVIEWS. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE TECHNO MUSIC THAT I ENJOY, IE... THE CHEMICAL BROS, PRODIGY, AND CRYSTAL METHOD, BUT THIS IS TOO SLOW FOR MY TASTE. IT ACTUALLY PUT ME TO SLEEP! THE START OF IT IS VERY SLOW WITH AN ANNOYING WOMAN SINGING. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CD IT DOES GET BETTER. IT WAS NOT WORTH THE MONEY FOR A COUPLE OF GOOD SONGS. THAT IS JUST MY OPINION. I LIKE A LITTLE RYTHEM AND EXCITEMENT."
5,Absolutely top class,"Three tracks on these CDs hit a real soft spot for me, being blindingly emotional, technically fantastic, extremely intelligent and absolutely inspiring. They are If I Survive, Finished Symphony and Kid 2000 are all tracks of the highest of music calibre, the rest are simply fantastic too.If you like any form of emotional electronic music, and you haven't bought this album, you are missing out. Words cannot describe how great this album is - if you're reluctant about liking 'electronic' music, give this a chance, it'll blow your mind."
5,Progressive?,"I bought this cd a month ago and have hardly listened to it until the other day. I have to say that I should have been! This is one impressive and CREATIVE piece of work. The guys that make up Hyrbrid are GODS!!! Haha, just kidding. If you like ""Finished Symphony you will enjoy this cd. ""Hi Life (Live Remix)"" double thumbs up....buy this now!"
4,Wide Angle -- A Jazzy Look at Techno,"_Wide Angle_ by Hybrid is a crisp, clear manipulation of a wide (if you'll pardon the pun) selection of soundscapes. Its a spectacular aural journey in many ways-- from the retribution-oriented ""If I Survive,"" to the haunting ""Dreaming Your Dreams,"" to the French verbal attack of ""Sinequanon,"" to the clear ""Beach Coma"" and ""Theme From Wide Angle,"" Hybrid never fails to keep you on your toes. Classification eludes me. Rather than try to define it, I will only state that its a rare opus that, by the second track, has your whole body grooving to its ambience. If you're a music-lover in search of something new, something with a more traditional, instrumental feel, while still retaining a throbbing, electronic pulse, look no further. Hybrid fits the bill."
5,Best. Album. Ever.,"I was first introduced to Hybrid when I bought Kinetica for the PS2. I fell in love with the opening song and after flipping through the instruction booklet, managed to find out about the artist. Literally the same day, I went out and bought this CD and to this day I'm still loving it. When I first bought it, it was the only CD in my stereo for weeks. Even now I still listen to it regularly. If I Survive and Finished Symphony are by far the best songs on the CD, but they're all amazing in the end."
5,thanks,I enjoy classical music. This book is wonderful and it is a great book for learning and practicing. I'm still learning.
4,Pretty good book,"It's a very good educational book for the intermediate guitar player who wants to be challenged. A challenge it does provide, however, it does not have a huge variety of great songs in the back."
2,not to my expectation,The book was not to my expectation. I thought it would have more meaningfull excersices and more peaces to play
2,Misleading Cover,"I like Harold Lloyd, and this DVD has some very good material. However, the cover shows a scene from Safety Last (where he is hanging from the clock) and that movie is not part of this 5-DVD set."
3,harold lloyd,this set is fair;it gives you someone other than chaplin to enjoy/hate.chaplin is still the king of the silent film comedy era.that's not to say lloyd isn't good;he is.it's just that chaplin had a different approach/style that translated better into laughs.
3,Useful but not universal,This fits two pin US plugs to the UK three prong standard. It seems well made but is pricier than some alternatives. Be warned that if you have any 3-pin US plugs this will NOT work. For me that's not an issue for most of my devices such as camera battery chargers but if you're travelling with a laptop which has a 3-pin US plug look at other products. The posted image is somewhat misleasding in this respect.
5,Excellent US to Great Britain adapter.,"Fits American plugs well, both double-pronged and grounded plugs, including those with one prong larger than the other. Also takes continental European double-circular plugs. Price is a bit high for a simple converter, but it seems well-made and is a good investment in an overseas trip. Fast service and product is exactly as described."
2,Uncomfortable,I thought this would be the ideal light weight chair for reading at the beach but I was wrong. You have to keep the straps pretty short in order to sit up but then you find you kind of are folded up in this thing leaning back at an odd angle. It sort of looks like your a child whose fallen into a potty. Loosen the straps though and you find you really aren't sitting up. The whole thing also wraps around you because there's no bracing so it digs into your thighs and back. This is not ideal for sitting and reading at the beach. I'm really disappointed. This is not a good chair for reading at the beach.
5,I concur: it is most definitely a saw.,"I agree with Athos. This is most certainly a saw and it saws things rather well. Unlike the other review, I have not used this to saw metal yet, but it certainly does a fine job on other materials, like hardened plastic, rubber, and silicone. Those weak materials didn't stand a chance! Five stars.Kudos for Amazon for their packaging techniques. I bought this for automotive use, and I too received this saw in an extra-large box. Once I removed the five miles of bubble packing material, I was able to park my car inside and use it as a makeshift garage. I've since donated it to a local school which is using it as an amphitheater shell for their summer production of Hamlet."
1,The Blade Broke off,I was cutting a thin pipe and the front nut holding the blade snapped off and the products was rendered useless. This was the second time I had used the product. Bad Product.
5,It definitely hacks it,As expected it does what it supposed to. Great quality and design. Good price. Highly recommended if you need to cut something ! ;)
3,"comfortable rubber handle, obsolete tension mechanism","This saw is a step forward from the cheapest (five bucks?) Chinese-made hack saw, as it has a more comfortable rubber handle.Unfortunately, the tension mechanism is still a wing nut at the end of the blade, and it is hard to achieve high tension with it. As the result, the blade sometimes positions itself at an angle to the saw frame during the cutting, and the cut leans to one side. I would prefer another Stanley model, for example 15-113, it employs a better tension mechanism.The saw can adjust to three blade sizes: 12, 10 and 8 inches. If I could find an 8 inch blade anywhere, this would be a great saw for my tool bag: it would fit perfectly, and I do not always need accuracy on the road. However, only 12 and 10 inch blades are sold in stores and online. And so, it's another miss."
3,Disappointed,"Stanley used to be a reliable brand, but this was a bit of a disappointment. This one should work (as long as you tighten it well), but it would be nice if the blade was held a bit more firmly (locator for blade rotation leaves a LOT to be desired). I only need a hacksaw a few times a year, so expect this will do. Price was okay, but would not want to be using it everyday. Like a lot of things, they are not made as they used to be (my old hacksaw was still working great after 40 years, but someone walked off with it so I needed a replacement)"
1,A very poor text,"This is one of the poorer examples of a medical textbook that I have yet encountered. It is poorly organized and lacks helpful formatting. Even after a cursory review I found it riddled with inaccuracies and errors. There were several contradictions between chapters and even within chapters! It is exceedingly verbose and vague and filled with poor grammar, such as double negatives. If you really want a good path text, Robbins is light years beyond Rubin & Farber in both form and substance."
3,Nice pictures. Could use a little more organization.,Some of the chapters (e.g. Kidney) could be a little less wordy and more organized.
3,One misunderstanding can cause a lot of wonderful events...,"Sam Devlin makes a bet that he can convince a very particular ""soiled dove"" to not only spend an entire evening with him, but to do so... for free. Armed with nothing more than the description of the woman, he mistakenly gives all his attention to the wrong woman... the preacher's oldest daughter, Charity.Charity is intrigued by the handsome man that roams into town, and can barely keep her eyes off him. Only she must spend all her time attempting to protect her 15 year old sister from getting herself into serious trouble... not to mention keep the wrath of their father off their back, and the talk of the town. However, when the handsome man that is cleverly nicknamed, Devil, starts giving her his undivided attention... she starts taking more chances... chances that can only mean Devlin's freedom, once he learns of the mistaken identity."
4,"Great BBQ tool, would be even better in stainless steel",I am using the Weber 2501 Kabob Set on my Weber Q220. It delivers very nice and tasty results and is easy to handle on the BBQ. In terms of cleaning (should not be put to dishwasher due to nickel plating) and durability it would be great if they were made of stainless steel.
5,Truly inspirational to a budding musician.......,"I have read countless books on the Blues and this one has shown me, in numerous, short, and to the point descriptions and interviews, that this music will never die. It starts out with some background, then chronologically reaches out to the people who were influenced. A great book to start with because of the number of photos taken during the time that all of this was taking place. It even goes as far out to show you the influences on ""white boys"". Simply amazing."
1,Childs chairs,The description did not say they were children size Chairs.Cost too much to send back gave them to charity.Bad deal!!!!!!!
1,"Cheap Design, not worth more than $10 each","Small flimsy chairs that would hardly hold a child, let alone an adult. Not worth $50 by any means. Would not recommend these chairs for any kind of use, too many other options."
1,Please Read the Fine Print!,"Okay, I can't say whether version 2.0 stinks or not. I believe I may have a previous version, but can't say for sure. All I know is that my Magix Piano and Keyboard Workshop program didn't even install properly, since I use Windows XP. I checked the company's web site and there is only one vague reference to this program, and no patches available. When I bought the software, it said it is for Windows OS. Copyright is year 2001. Go figure. All I can say with certainty is to MAKE SURE YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM VERSION IS SUPPORTED IN BEFORE YOU BUY THE SOFTWARE! Otherwise it is an abject waste of money. I wrote to Magix and informed them that I would post a negative review of their product until such time that they find someone in software development to create a patch for XP users. If anyone else out there has had better luck than me, more power to you!"
1,MAGIX PIANO & KEYBOARD WORKSHOP 2ND EDITION,"THE RATING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS ZERO STARS. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS PUT OFF WITH NO REPLY MY HOME PHONE IS 703 685 4935. WHEN I TRIED TO MAKE A BACKUP DISC MY COMPUTER SAID THAT THERE ARE ERRORS ON THE DISK. THE SAME RESPONSE WITH TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTERS. I WASTED TWO BLANK CDs. I WANT A PROGRAM DISK WITH NO ERRORS. MICROSOFT SAID THAT IT DOES NOT RECOGNISE ANY OF THE ""E"" MAIL ADDRESSES I COPIED FROM THE INSTRUCTION BOOK. THE PROGRAM HANGS UP ON WINDOWS 98. IT MAY BE DUE TO THE ERRORS ON THE DISK REPORTED WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A BACKUP. NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER IS NOT HELPFUL. THE OTHER THREE PROGRAMS I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON ARE ALL WORTH FIVE STARS BUT I REGRET HAVING BOUGHT THE MAGIX PROGRAM."
5,makes some yummy cookies with this,"works great, been looking for the rosette iron in stores and could not find it, went up on line and there it was,"
3,it does not look like an angel,these rosette iron when you make the bunuelo it does not look like an angel you have to have a bit of imagination to see an angel.
4,Not for the faint of heart,"Not for the faint of heart, Pete Dexter's Paris Trout will send chills up and down your spine. This riveting tale of a respected white Georgian shopkeeper is sheer evil. Sinister and wicked, this page-turner will keep you up all night - either because the story is so engaging or because you are afraid to turn the lights out!"
3,"A Talented Writer, A Disturbing Tale","Pete Dexter is clearly a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display in Paris Trout. His character development is rich and complex, and the reader gets to know each of the book's figures with intimate familiarity. The book is gripping but I found the ending unsatisfying. Without ruining it for those who haven't read it, I just felt that after so much tragedy and bloodshed by the evil Trout, I thought the heroes deserved a better fate. But perhaps that is Dexter's point -- things do not always have a happy ending in the real, unforgiving world."
2,Surprising disappointment.,"I have to agree with the reviewer from Yuba City. After finishing this novel I was also surprised that it had won the National Book Award. Although I agree with other reviewers that the depiction of complacency by the Cotton Point citizens with respect to Paris Trout's deeds was well done by the author, I did not find the character development, the writing or the plot to be above average. The National Book Award and glowing reviews this novel received set my expectations higher than the novel could meet."
2,"""due to problems of tone and syntax, not to mention good taste...""","I have to say, I had high hopes for this novel. But it is so tortuously over-written, it is hard to keep a straight face. There are all kinds of little leaps of logic and lapses of grammar not related to the speech or private thoughts of Southern characters in the story (to which one can give wide latitude). The first decent scene is the viewing of the body of young, innocent Rosie in the hospital--a hospital that seems about ten times larger than such a ""small town"" would possess. Just not edited at all, it seems. Very poorly written. So poorly, it gets in the way of what could be a decent, if standard, story of crime and racism in the American South circa late 1950s."
2,Full of gimmicks,"It takes more than guns, law books, idiots, and sprinklings of the n-word to make a good novel. Why was anyone impressed with this?"
2,truly evil,"This book is about a truly evil person- PARIS TROUT- and the collection of misfit's and sad people he affect's. From the poor girl he kill's to his wife, to his lawyer, he destroy's everything around him . After reading about these sad people in post-war GEORGIA you might need a shower."
4,Dexter paints characters well,"I don't happen to like everything Dexter writes, but, here, he demonstrates a superior knowledge of the writing art. Few characters are drawn more deftly and powerfully than Paris Trout. When all is said and done, the reader feels almost like he knows Trout personally, though he may wish he didn't. This is truly an original novel which is one reason I suspect it won the national book award. Perhaps some feel that racism is a worn-out topic. Well, not the way Dexter handles it. A well written novel."
4,"Chilling, ....I couldn't stop reading this one!","I grew up in Milledgeville, Ga (Cotton Point?) and remember the killing of the 2 lawyers. As an 11 year old child, I was spared the more sinister details of the real life story. I believe that Pete Dexter attended elementary school in Milledgeville at the time this crime took place. As an author he did his homework, then twisted the tale just enough to leave me gasping!"
3,Repetitive,"Good theology but found the book very repetitive in most regards. I found some very good quotes that can be used in my writings, but nothing new is really potrayed in the Book minus the fact that works cannot save us. That is the profound theme of the book."
4,Classic,A must read for any minister who desires to devote his life to the service of God and men. Read it!
3,Not for Industrial Use,This is a nice frame for someone who would infrequently use it. It is comfortable in your hand but there are a few flaws. First off the tension isn't as high as I would like it to be even at the highest setting and the blade wobbles slightly when in use. Another problem I have with the saw frame is the mechanism used when changing blades. It seems like it is fairly easy for the blade holder to disengage. Overall this frame would be nice for a homeowner but being a machinist by trade and using it frequently it just falls short. I would recommend looking elsewhere for an everday use saw frame
1,Frightening and sad ...,"... but not the way Mr. Marrs intends. Proof positive that to a man whose only tool is a hammer, everything tends to look like a nail. In this case, Texe Marrs' tool is Fundamentalist Churchianity, and sure enough, he finds evidence of ""Satanic conspiracy"" everywhere from the NASA space programme to the Smurfs. The only serious question it raises in the mind of a sophisticated reader is whether or not Mr. Marrs actually believes what he's writing.I'm afraid that he probably does."
5,Strong Message,"His critics dismiss Texe Marrs with the label ""Fundamentalist Christian."" So be it. But at least he takes a stand. At least he reads the Bible of his faith. At least he applies it to the world around him.I like Marrs' books. They have the excitement of conspiracy theory. But grounded in Bible study. If you don't believe in the Bible (or are afraid your friends will think you're a nut if you do) you probably won't like his books. But if you're into Bible prophecy, and use the Christian Bible to guide your life, then I think you'll appreciate Marrs' perspective.I'll admit, I try not to put any Christian writer on a pedestal. God is still the definitive Author. But there's a place for writers who use the Bible to comment on current events. I appreciate the work they do. Especially when it prompts me to go back and read Bible passages they've pointed out.So, Mr. Marrs: I thank you for taking so much flak, yet still keeping the faith. And I eagerly await your next book."
1,Laugh a minute!,"This one is funny in that ""it's scary to think that someone might take this serously and actualy put their psudo-intilectual faith baised conservitism to use trying to bring down the castle that Matel and Hanna-Barbarra hath wrot.""When one looks at the state of extreme relgious beliefs it never fails to scare and entertain all at once..."
1,an improvement over his other books,"Although this book is an improvement over his other books, I am so sorry to say I still did not feel it deserved anything more than 1 star.I am sure everyone has hated the world at some point in their lives, wished the world would blow up in flames and fantasized about watching everyone they hate die a slow painful death. Texe Marr's obviously hates life and this world and chooses to cope with his anger by publishing books venting his anger.He savors every moment describing how the world is going to end and everyone he hates is going to meet a horrible death. I am so sorry anyone would have to endure living with all that hate, he clearly needs a lot of help."
1,No Magix in this product!,Very poor software and they know it. You can always tell when a software company is peddling something with little value because they make it extremely difficult to contact them. And of course the Magix.com website is a maze of misdirection and confusion.The cheaply produced manual is extremely sketchy giving you almost no information on how to operate the software and with the website offering no further assistance you are left with nothing but a useless pair of CD's.The Guitar Instruction is nothing but white text on a blue background and there is no sound or video with the instruction section like they lead you to believe in the material on the box. The overall quality is so poor It reminded me of the old MSDOS programs from the 1980's.If they had put as much effort into developing the product as they did in their packaging it might have worked. But they didn't and it doesn't.
3,Kasparov...,"Kasparov is an interesting individual, half Armenian, half Jewish, and Russian. The director has done an awful job of making this documentary since there could have been more information in regard to the second game or all the other games with the big blue or in general instead of adding unnecessary drama, music, voices, etc. This was suppose to be a documentary not a drama. Regardless there aren't any documentaries in regard to Kasparov and this becomes unfortunately a must see if interested in the game. Disappointing."
1,Game Over!,"I bought this movie to share with my 3rd-5th grade Gifted Students who are learning chess this semester. It was boring, dry and looks as if a high-school film student made it (no disrespect to HS film students). No wonder it was less than $5!"
2,Why was the narrator whispering on purpose?!?!?!,The narrator at multiple times would purposefuly whisper. It was the most annoying narration ever. No idea why they did that.I would give 3 stars if it weren't for the whispering.Other than that issue this would have made for an interesting 15 minute segment on 60 minutes or something like that. Just not enough for a whole movie.
2,Great Story Poorly Told,"This was a fascinating point of history where man versus machine may have finally reached a point where man is defeated in the one area in which he has always dominated: intelligence. The story is a great story to hear, but the video does not do a good job telling the story. The games are not covered in enough detail, one by one building anticipation. The producers use a whispering narration which is difficult to hear at best, and continually annoying. This could have and probably should have been a great DVD but it isn't, and it comes down to production: camera shots, music, uncomfortable face close ups, and a lack of game commentary and coverage. It is still interesting as the story itself is a turning point in history, but it could have been great."
3,Not too much,"A lot of information , however most are not that important..Kasparov Vs Karpov scene was the best part , I wanted more scenes like this one..Great scoreNot for buying .. just rent"
2,How could you screw up a documentary on such a great subject?,"The producer of this movie took a great subject and created a documentary with a horrible sound track and constant anoying ""scary movie"" type effects. This movie would be a great study for people wanting to learn how not to make films. It's almost like it was produced by someone who just got movie editing software for the first time and was going overboard trying to see what they could do. The most enjoyable clips in the movie were scenes taken from new casts and 3rd party sources. Someone could make this move 100% better by just editing out the sound effects and music. A little Bach or Mozart could be inserted over the existing sound track to make the film more watchable. The story of the match can stand on its own and doesn't need cheap tricks to manipulate the audience into seeing the chess match from Kasparov's point of view (a nightmare)."
1,Not for Chess Players,"A driveling film that should've had 2/3rds of it edited out.The usual moronic style: Shaky cameras, five second soundbites from a whirlwind of talking heads, ""spooky"" music, anti-corporatist agitprop, conspiracy theorizing...Hey, here's a conspiracy theory: Some fool we're supposed to take seriously states that IBM made ""billions"" out of the match. Maybe they gave the neurotic Kasparov a few million to lose?Hey, players: read Pandolfini's book on the match. I'm not a great fan of Mr. P, but it's a move-by-move Chernev-style annotation of the six games. Quite interesting and taught me, at least, a bit more about the game.Anyway, K lost the match, and serve him right. Deep Blue didn't win it.Karpov would've crushed DB: Play the board, not the man/machine!"
4,Game Over - Kasparov and the Machine - DVD,"Very interesting DVD for any semi-serious chess player: a viewer could understand better psychological aspects of the game and financial sides of a big tournament. I like the story, and it was real fun to hear Kasparov's commentaries. There were some irritating moments though: 1. too much ""whispering behind the scene"" by a narrator; 2. too much fragments of old-style b/w movie about chess-machine; 3. the famous DEEP BLUE has been shown just in a locked box."
3,not true for the rematch,"Here is the link to the open letter from Feng-hsiung Hsu:http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/feng.htmlMr.Kasparov is the one who refused the rematch. To me, he's just the one who can't face the lost."
5,"Great, but disturbing","I read this book in one sitting on a cross-country plane trip, and found it engrossing the whole way. At first, I found it a little odd that a woman would just simply have sex with a man she only set eyes on once, but as I read on, Alice's motives became more clear and the attraction to Adam was understandable. I found myself holding my breath in certain spots, when Alice was about to be caught in her snooping. Killing Me Softly is like Bridget Jones meets Fatal Attraction. Wonderful summer reading."
2,I will not read another book by Nicci French,"Boring, Boring, Boring...It was hard to get past the roughsex. You want to shake this girl and tell her to WAKE UP! I alsodon't understand how she kept her job in the midst of all this trauma in her life. She never seemed to stay at work all day. In the real world, we would all be fired!"
2,It's only a summer read.,"The character of Adam is not explored with enough depth to be as compelling to me as he was to Alice. We weren't allowed to discover Alice's longings with her to understand her actions. This story pilfered too much from other successful or popular ideas to be cohesive. It's a good summer read, nothing more."
2,"Unlikeable characters, contrived plot","Read the book in one sitting. Wanted to get to the end to find out what happened, but also to have it over with. Character development woefully inadequate. The characters' motivations were never explained in any way. The male character was like a cardboard cut out. The sexual violence as described by the female protagonist left me with a queasy feeling. I bought this book because of several 5 star reviews listed on this site, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I'm truly amazed that anyone would ever want to re-read this book."
4,Great summer read!,"I ordered this book to take to the beach with me. I arrived 2 days before I left. I finished it in a day and half. It was great. Alice, the main character, captures you from the first page and does not let go. I generally do not read books written in the first person as this one. Here the lust, passion and fear could not be as compelling if written in the third person. Only Alice's perspective grips the reader. The book earned 4 stars from me because it is hard to believe that Alice, the scientist, would fall for Adam as quickly and completely as she did. That's the book's only negative. But once you buy into that, sit back and enjoy!"
5,WOW!!! What a story!!! Best book I've read in a while!!,"Great, gripping story with interesting characters. I could not put this book down until I finished it. I highly recommend it!"
2,Entertaining enough but far from brilliant.,"This reminded me of another book by the ""Nicci French"" duo, something with women in sheds that I've forgotten. It seems they have found a successful formula and are sticking to it.It was an easy read and a pleasant enough way to pass time. However, I found myself skimming pages towards the end. I spotted a number of inconsistencies, such as Alice pouring glasses into a sink then saying ""I stood up."" Perhaps she pours into the sink while seated, who knows? It did give me the impression of sloppiness, another big thick 3-for-the-price-of-2 novel being churned out."
5,One of the best books of the year,"""Killing Me Softly"" is the best book I have read this year. A psychological thriller that explores the relationship between a beautiful, powerful but deeply flawed man and a smart but needy woman. The characters are brilliantly drawn and totally believable and you will have a hard time putting the book down."
2,Disliked it immensely,I guess if we can understand why Alice Loudon allows herself to become smitten with someone she scarcely knows ..then we can explain why so many women in the world become victims of abuse.
3,Enjoyable,The Nether Scroll is disapointing to most of Lynn Abbey's fans as it is certainly not her best work. But it is still an enjoyable read. I finished it rather quickly and it kept my attention.
2,Lore? No.,"The ""Lost Empires"" category lured me to this book. I hoped to find more information about the past, something to compliment the Netherese set (which I do have). Instead, it's a story of very modern peoples, and only passing references to the artifact of the title. There is one section, late in the novel, giving a better idea of the nature of these scrolls, but just as a tiny glimmer was shown, it is ripped away revealing nothing of interest.This novel has a decent story on its own, and if you want political intregue with the Zhents, this has some value. But it's not where my interests lie. (...)"
1,What a stinker,"Reading this book was like being force fed a food that makes you want to vomit. You don't want to continue, but you really have no choice unless you want to waste 6 bucks. There are some nice points to the book, the female warrior was nice, and the things the mage learned from the scroll should have been expounded upon sooner as it was the only real item of interest in the whole dang book. As it is the writing was slow and the majority of characters were uninteresting. I can say I will never reread this book."
1,I've read waaaaaaaaay better!,I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED! NO WAY THAT THIS WAS FROM THE AUTHOR! HE USUALLY IS VERY GOOD... DON'T READ IT!
1,"Good Luck, Marianne!","I wish Ms. Gilliam the best of luck; however, I, like others who have read her work, am a tad bit disconcerted by the lack of support for the argument promised by the title. Instead, we find a discussion--a bit too rambling, at that--dedicated to assertions and observations I have found better said in others' work. In fact, I feel it necessary to note that a great deal of the discussion owes much to Thomas Moore, whose _Care of the Soul_ more clearly argues in favor of the God as love concept, something never directly addressed in Ms. Gilliam's book.The latter is but an example of some of what's in store for readers of _How AA Failed Me_. The problem, to me, does not necessarily lie, however, with the author. I contend that the editors have culpability. I think Ms. Gilliam's treatise shows promise, but is in need of serious editing (not to mention a title change). Thanks!"
1,How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me,Maybe the author should stop whining and get herself to a meeting.
4,Courageous and Inspiring,"Not many authors would have the courage to write a book entitled ""How Alcoholics Anonymous Failed Me."" Marianne Gilliam has the nerve to attack one of the world's sacred cows and I applaud her for doing so. The fact that this book is incredibly hard to find shows just how intolerant the corporate world is towards 12 step alternatives. The author has given me hope and inspiration that I am not alone in my disillusionment with AA, Alanon and other spiritually based support groups. I particularly found the section on 'when your 12 step program stops working"" very helpful. Especially her story about the backlash she recieved upon criticizing AA. I could relate 100% and its nice to see these thoughts in print. My only fault with the book is that it tends to wander a bit and is overly apologetic for its controversial views. Even still, I give it 4 stars simply for its original subject matter. Thanks you Mariann for writing the book I've always wanted to read."
2,good point; poorly written,"This book is really, really--and I mean really--badly written. While any views that attempt to break the strangle-hold AA has on our culture must be celebrated for their courage and much needed contributions to what has for too long been a monologue rather than dialogue, Gilliam is repetitive, simplistic, and dull. A few good insights, to be sure, and the book offers a very valuable summary of resources for further inquiry/reading in the back, but she essentially replaces the slogans of AA dogma with equally nauseating new age-isms. The book can drive a girl to drink, really, but it got me started on a path of questioning nonetheless."
3,One woman's self-empowered recovery,"I found this book interesting and thought-provoking, although it could have used some serious editing! As a veteran of AA, I found the criticisms ""right on"". I have always had problems with the Higher Power idea, the discouraging of questions, and the ridicule of those who disagree in any way. I agreed with her thesis that focusing on flaws encourages hopelessness and powerlessness. But the book could have been half its length and twice as effective. Interested parties should check out Moderation Management, a successful controlled drinking problem that has meetings nationwide and an online mailing list. The book ""Moderate Drinking"" by Audrey Kishline outlines this valuable program in detail."
2,50% Good,"I am a certified AOD counselor that expected more of this title then what it delivered. While I found Marianne Gilliam's insight into the failures of AA's program to be honest and refreshing, I was disappointed by the ""spirituality"" emphasis on the polyannish approach of ""love is all that is needed"" to find, and maintain sobriety. I did not expect as much of a ""self-help book"" that this turned out to be. I would recommend this book (especially to women!) to anyone looking ABOVE AND BEYOND the ""AA/12-Step"" approach to ANY addiction. I agree entirely with Marianne's foundation that AA/the 12-Steps are indeed, a FAILURE at encouraging sobriety, sobriety maintenance, or independence of thought, or action. As for the rest of the book's postulating about ""love"", it's what has worked for Marianne, and she invites you to use it if you think it can work for you, otherwise, you are welcome to choose your own path."
2,"Contrary to the title, AA did work for Gilliam","The title of this book, no doubt written by her editor-publisher, implies failure of the 12-step program to bring Gilliam the inner piece she desired. To the contrary, AA brought a modicum of structure to an otherwise chaotic life, allowing Marianne to begin digging deeper."
1,Her book title has little to do with the overall contents,"Gilliam uses Alcoholics Anonymous and her negative inference about it as the means to draw a readership. She is full of extreme tunnel vision, narrow minded and offers little to show for her alleged achievements. It is more a self serving endeavor than a mechanism to offer a view of various options for a broad range of people suffering from alcoholism and substance abuse. Repeatedly she says what did not work for her in Alcoholics Anonymous and never mentions the myriad of successes in AA by folks who are atheists, agnostics, feminist, professional and intellegent thoughtful people. Her use of stats and numbers are dubious at best. It was a worthless endeavor, except as a story of one woman's visceral angry response the program of Alcoholics Anonymous and tons of self endulgence. BORING."
4,El Monje Que Vendio Su Ferrari,"Estoy muy encantada con este libro, me ayudo mucho para recordar que la vida es muy linda, solamenta hay que saberla vivir. Compre un segundo libro para regalarselo a mi amiga, por que quiero que ella pueda superar por lo que esta pasando. En pocas palabras, les recomiendo a hombres y mujeres a que leen ""El Monje Que Vendio Su Ferrari"" les aseguro que lo van a disfrutar.Saludos!"
4,"Nice for ""around-the-house""","We have done a lot of remodeling on our new home, and this hacksaw served us well. Changing blades was easy and the saw is overall quite sturdy and rugged."
5,Best in Show,"Tried many hacksaws and this is the one I kept. fast blade changes and spartan comfort make this Stanley a great value. One piece of advice, when you close the blade tension lever, hold up the locking trigger and release it once you've got the tension lever in place instead of ""snapping"" into the locked position. That saves wear and tear. As for blades, I recommend Starrett Bi-Metal blades, cheap enough and long lasting. Lastly, don't loan it out or you might be back to buy a new one, lol!"
5,Great Little Hacksaw,"This is a great little hacksaw - solid, simple, and durable. Changing the blade is a snap."
5,Nice Hacksaw,"I like a fixed length hacksaw; easier to change blades. Maybe a 12 inch would be better since the blades are more readily available, but this 10 inch is fine for me."
2,PhotoStory on CD & DVD,"Boy this is a joke,just like there other program Pictures to CD & DVD.Geting support joke no.2.I had to call to find out how to open the program, joke no.3.After you get in it's still hard seting everything up the way you want it. Soon you learn to place your pictures then go back each time to download music and anything else you want to put into you video. When you burn a cd or dvd your pictures are printed your lose every thing else.I cant logon to onto the web sight, for what reason I don't know. I have told everyone in the club not to buy it.I'm looking for a program to replace this one.If it would burn your compleated project it would be great.Theres too many goofs in this program. I will sell this for S/H $4.00"
5,A great book.,"I pretty much thought I had read all the best books concerning starting a new magazine or getting work within the industry. Then, I found The Magazine From Cover To Cover.This book will grab you in such a manner as does your favorite magazine.Interested in magazine historical trends? Read chapters 3 and 4.Why are magazines important? Or, better yet, how can attitudes be changed by magazines? Re-read chapters 3 and 4, then go on to read chapters 11 and 12 BEFORE you screw up!This book probably does a better job than most others in showing why magazines have been important; how they can lead a revolution in society; what layout design and what editorial tone should be taken to appeal to your audience; and, especially, why doing that which gains notoriety may not be wise ethically, morally or financially.This is a terrific book with the look and feel and dynamic spirit of a magazine."
5,Incredibly useful reference book,"If you're looking to learn the basics of the magazine publishing business, this book is an excellent place to begin. Chapters include (among others): The Magazine as a Storehouse, The Magazine as a Marketplace, Magazine Business Plans, Magazine Production, and Magazines for the Twenty-First Century. Every chapter contains the basic aspects, multiple real-world examples, and a useful list of further reading."
4,Old but good reading,Didnt realise that this was such and old issue but from what I have read the information is great. A newer issue would have given more recent case studies/examples though. Came on time and in great condition just as described!
1,"Oh Dear, Oh Dear, Oh Dear...","Yep this film sucks. Saw this at Cannes two years ago and was bored rigid by the whole affair.Whilst the idea is okay, it feels little more than a cheap , poorly made remake of the far better 'The Warriors'.Gordon Alexander (the real star of the film), Brandan Carr, Cecily Faye and Jamie Choo are all superb if all under used where as Chris Jones, Silvio Symac and Shane Steyn (as well as many other great UK action stars) are pushed aside for the less talented Monaghan.What bugged me the most was the over use of sloooooowwwww mooootioooon for EVERY fight.Jobson, former rock icon and solid director in his own right, is well out of his depth here and generally does a really bad job of making a poor film better.Please avoid. It may make them Stop them making pap like this."
3,Huh.. Interesting,"I picked this movie up at Walmart of all places. I only bought it because Dominic Monaghan (Lost) was in it. This definitely isn't the best movie ever made but it does have some great fight scenes. The lead character does way too much voice over. However, the girls in this movie really kick butt. This is a good movie for a leisurely afternoon but nothing fantastic. Dom Monaghan did a pretty good job as a bad guy. However, it was hard to watch at times. Who can think of Merry as a bad guy? Overall a good B movie."
1,Pure dog poop,"This a poor copy of ""The Warriors,"" which was quite interesting many years ago.How dare these people to misuse such remarkable athletic talent? They even have one of the best female Karate champs in the world doing her thing to no avail.As a martial arts movie, this thing fails miserably. As an action flick it is far below the worst of Hong-Kong products.Do not buy it, do not rent it, stay away from this boring, slow, idiotic piece of garbage."
3,Interesting but . . .,"This is an interesting book. Unlike many, I have been aware of white indentured servants in Colonial and 18th/19th century America for years. I've never heard of this case and Bailey's account of the American and especially, Southern legal system regarding slavery and indentured servitude is very revealing.However, in the chapter about the city of New Orleans, Bailey's description of Vodou (voodoo to many) worshippers in early 19th century New Orleans seemed to reek of Hollywood sensationalism. Devil worshippers? Really? And zombies?Hopefully, Mr. Bailey will be a bit more in-depth in his research of all aspects of his subject."
4,"Exceptionally detailed, another image from our past","This book moved me. This segment of history is not one that is discussed often. There were plenty of people who could pass. Given the opportunity, one would gladly accept it. It is so interesting reading the legal background of slavery. I was so impressed with the the thorough research that the author did for this book. It brings to mind so many stories of slaves bartering for their right to just exist.Sally Miller was brilliant. If one is to believe what they see and it is beneficial for you to perpetuate their belief why not. It was brilliantly executed and one slave used the legal system to set herself free.Great read."
4,Interesting though tedious,"The story involves the ""unraveling"" of the life of one woman who was held, perhaps illegally, as a slave. The history of slavery in New Orleans from the early to mid 1800s is revealed in law and passion. Although a narrative, some of the personalities are described in much detail and actually make them seem quite real. This is a fascinating and devastating account of the realities of slavery. I would recommend this book."
5,Alternate Universe,This is a great read.Baily gives us a story worthy of a Hollywood blockbuster - a story about a young orphan German girl sold into slavery and the legal efforts made by New Orlean's German community to set her free. The story has many exciting twists and turns.As good as the story is is Baily's account of Louisiana's case law concerning slaves and redemptioners (indentured whites). The law is familiar and strange. Familiar because we know the legal procedures; strange because the law we learn about treats people as property.Highly recommended!
3,Important reading to understand American history,"We often think we have read and heard enough about the history of slavery in the United States. This book while telling a personal story which is very easy reading, in-fact takes a very unique and complex perspective and exposes so much more than the story of one slave. By reading this book I have gained a much better understanding of many American attitudes that I used to find puzzling before. This is a valuable work and can be very useful for anyone who wants to better understand the roots of American racism."
4,Great historically based novel!,"Long, but intriguing novel based on American history during the mid-1800s. Puts a new light on the way black (and white) people were treated. The ending was totally unexpected!"
3,not for MBA students,"This book was required for an MBA class. It is more suited for undergraduates. It does not encourage deeper thinking or analysis appropriate for the graduate level.The book is strong in theoretical understanding but weak in management applications. It is nice to be able to list the names of motivation theories, for example, but the authors seem uanble to provide criteria one might want to consider for policy decisions. I wonder if this book is by and for academics who have no real life work experience but need to publish or perish.End of chapter supplementary articles are only from the New York Times. Although the book's introductory material lets us know how wonderful this is, a greater variety of source material would enhance the overall effectiveness. After all, the book does speak of diversity.To its credit, the book is reasonably readable and does not overwhelm us with too much esoteric academic speak."
2,Copy cat,The book did not say it is a custom edition. In fact it is copied from an old edition. I was shocked when I realized that this was only a copy on the paper back. I think seller should explicitly mention so that buyer has a choice.
5,beautiful music,I loved this movie and the sound tract so impressed me I hunted down the CD.It's hypnotic and achingly beautiful.
1,Boring and Throw away,"I had to read this book because of a school project. This was a terrible book. I hated it from the beginning because it had no plot, story line, or good characters. About halfway through the book, one of the main characters, Mando, just left. it didn't say where or why he left, but Scott O'Dell didn't bring him back in the book. I am a little glad because Mando was just a pain. But unfortuanatly, Zia stayed. She was in every scene and was very boring. If anyone wants to read it, then i hope this helps you... THROW IT AWAY!!!"
3,Review for Zia,"Zia by Scott O Dell is a book about an islander who wishes to be reunited with her long lost aunt. Zia only has her little brother and the mission to take care of her. Zia 's brother is a determined character because he always tries to achive his goal. Whether it's catching the biggest fish in the sea, or paddling 60 miles on a canoe to find his aunt, Mando always tries his best to follow his dreams. My favorite part of this book is when Zia and Mando stock their canoe with rations and set out on the long and dangerous voyage to their aunt."
4,A Good Book 4 a Good Reason!,"I loved this book as well as ""Island of the Blue Dolphins."" I believe that the book has a good plot,and the reason I only rated this book 4 out of 5 stars was because the settings got confusing.Anybody with any personality would enjoy this book once you've gotten into it. I also applause Scott O'Dell for the wonderful job he did."
4,"Zia, A review by ...","Zia is a good book. It has a good plot and an interesting story line. The story is about Zia, a fourteen-year-old Indian girl who is trying to find her aunt, Karana, on the Island of Blue Dolphins. Zia and Mando, her brother, find a boat on the shore and secretly repair it. They try to save her aunt, but they can’t make it in their little boat. Do they save her? Read the book and find out!I gave Zia four stars because it is good, but not great. There are a few boring parts, but the rest of the book makes up for them. I recommend this book to anyone who liked The Island of the Blue Dolphins."
1,If you admire the works of Scott O'Dell ignore this book.,"This book is inconsistent with O'Dell's writing styles, and completely changed the character's personality. It was extremely dissapointing."
3,A girl named Zia tries to find her long lost aunt.,"A girl named Zia is a teenager who lives in the Mission Santa Barbara. Her dream is to locate her beloved aunt, Karana on the Island of the Blue Dolphins. When Captain Nidever brings Karana to the Mission Santa Barbara, she loves it. Soon Karana falls very ill, and later dies. I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone, as it seemed to drag on and on forever"
2,Sequels are never as good as the first book.,"When I read Zia, I was disappointed. Personally, I do not think it was anywhere near as good as Island of the Blue Dolphins.Don't just take my advice,Please read it yourself and decide."
3,french culture,A good glimpse into French life and thinking. I work with many French people here in the US and it's helped me a little to understand behavior. I would have enjoyed the book even if I wasn't in my current work environment. It's interested to learn about others.
3,A worthy effort that sometimes falls flat,"This is an admirable study of differences between French and American cultural norms, habits, mores and the like, but the prose style is sometimes wooden, and the differences that the author intends us to understand are at times muddled. Also note that this study is nearly 30 years old and, while it certainly rings true in most respects, lifestyle and technoligical changes in the intervening years make some of the author's observations dated. From what others have told me who have read both, Sixty Million Frenchmen Can't Be Wrong by J-B Nadeau is a better read. And for a novel that gets cultural observations right and is a great read, A Year in the Merde by Steven Clarke can't be beat."
4,We liked this product a lot. It has ...,"We liked this product a lot. It has a fresh, minty, refreshing taste that's not too strong and is therefore good even for kids. Our three-year-old really liked it! I also liked that it has a flip top so the lid isn't lost. I recommend this product!"
4,"Great, great, great !","A very good job : perfect pictures, so I've buy the second opus ""Naked Coast to Coast"" : thank you Andrew ! Now, only one of the trilogy is missing to me. Maybe next purchase ? Certainly !"
2,poor exposures,I like the models and bits of information about the shoots and the girls are lovely. The Author A. Einhorn does not include camera settings and most pictures have poor lighting and are poorly exposed. Technically it is not a great book but I do like the models and theme of the book. I think $25 is about twice the price as I feel it is worth.
1,"if it isn't art, what is it?","Einhorn, like Stobblehouse, might claim to be part of a naturalist movement, free from affectedness and pretention in art photography, but I'm led to concede, having seen Einhorn's work (and Stobblehouse's), that if something isn""t art --if it's creator (or ""capturer"") doesn't esteem his image as something worthy of being embraced as art -- then it probably isn't any good. That""s Einhorn's and Stobblehouse's photography in a nutshell: Not any good. The interaction of photographer and model hasn't brought out any strengths residing in his models (excepting the cover photo). There is no purity of character, only a tawdry tease, a vacuum of anything more enlightening and elevating. Mercifully, all his photos are B/W. But, on that note, Einhorn comments that he met model so-and-so at a cabaret and afterwards they went back to her boyfriend's apartment where, as a plus, the lighting was nice: Good lighting is something he can leave to happenstance. He""s snapshot boy."
2,Don't wate your money!,"This is one of the worst photography books I've ever bought! Can't say anything good about it, so, I won't say any more."
2,"Great specs, but has electrostatic emmissions problems","I purchased the dv1170us from Best Buy mid Feb 2005. After two weeks, the computer started freezing. After calling techincal support, they transferred me to the product engineers. Come to find out there is an electro-static emmission problem on this model. When touching the left front speaker, the unit freezes. The engineers are working to fix this problem. So far, my laptop has been in two times for this issue. I would stay away from this laptop for at least 2 months (thats how long it usually takes to flush out excess inventory from their factor in China). Other than this one problem, I think this will be a great product. You can contact the support engineers directly at 866-671-7359 to get more informatio on this issue. Hope this helps folks considering this laptop."
5,Great!,"Hot but not overpowering, the flavor really helps with bland food items, like brown organic rice or microwave beef and beef burritos. I have a couple of bottles of the original and plan to get more the next time I go shopping. Really helps make something that may be plain and uniteresting more than palatable without burning your mouth. Get it!"
4,A favorite hot sauce,"For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food. Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches. Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Cholula Hot Sauce Original has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite. It is not too mild and not too hot and has an exceptional flavor. I tend to only use Cholula Hot Sauce Original for special occasions since I value it so much. Also, the bottle's wooden top is aesthetically pleasing. This is a recommendable hot sauce."
5,The World That Ttrade Created Book,My son needed this book very quickly for use in his History Class at School. It was purchased as a used book and arrived in a great condition and very quickly. Thank you for the great quality and quick manner of arrival. It was a nice surprise!
1,AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was made to read this book by my 10th grdae AP World History Teacher...It is quite possibly the WORST BOOK I have ever read....both in school and out....If it is humanly possible, STEER CLEAR FROM THE WORLD THAT TRADE CREATED!!!"
1,"it's a text book for a class, big whoop!","the world trade created is a required reading text book for an AP class at high school. I'm reading it because the teacher, who is a liberal, is requiring me to read it. Am I excited? well no! I'd rather read something a little more ...exciting."
5,A very provocative invitation,"When you read a chessbook you may simply search for a literal knowledge or better enter into a smart conversation between the author and you. This is the perfect book for that objective. There are no simple answers or ""to-do-lists"" to find here. This is a monography that invites you to follow the path after the ideas of many chessplayers. The only negative point in the book is the absence of a comprehensive opening tree."
4,Absolutely stunning guitar w/great tunes & vocals included!!,"This guy can simply rip on guitar!!!!!!!!! He is like Ty meets Nuno meets Ron Thal, such feel and so damn exciting!!!!!!!! His tone is SWEET!!!!!!!! The guy is a natural and I cannot wait for the next cd! This is almost a 5 star cd!"
1,What was the author thinking?,"This was mentioned on a booklist for intelligent girls. This book is the opposite of what an intelligent girl would read. The girl in the story has just graduated from high school. She is 17. While out at the store several 20something men she doesn't know surround her, taunt her, pick her up, toss her on the back of one of their motorcycles and drive off with her. Not even knowing each other they get passionate. He is pressuring her throughout the entire book to have sex. Towards the end they end up having quick meaningless sex. No protection mentioned on either side. The weirdest part of all-they are cousins. Their moms are sisters. I will not be letting my daughter read this book. The girl in this story does not think for herself and is not in any way a role model for any teenager. Why would an author write that it is okay for any girl to be treated or act this way."
3,Eh,"It was sort of like meh, whatever, so? and who really cares? sort of an affair not something i would ever read again and am surprised that so many people were interested enough in the plot line to actually care.. sooooo boring..."
2,this book is not worth 5 stars,"the reason i read this book was because i saw that so many people gave this book 5 stars and gave it great reviews. dont be mislead. this book was terrible. there was hardly any character development, everything was over-descripted and forget about any form of romance. the overall story was just silly and reminded me of the ending of LOST. what really irritated me was the boy the main character clare fell in love with. he was a rude jerk of a character who was obsessed with lust. there was no form of romance whatsoever and i just wanted to hit the main character for following the path she did in the book. its sad because she was at least likeable."
2,boring and misogynist,"The problems with this book are myriad. Here's a short list:1. It doesn't really make any sense, mostly because the character development is practically nonexistent. Likewise, the background is just sort of sketched in. It's not that it's confusing, it's just that neither the characters nor the plot really end up driving the action. There's no underlying logic to why anything happens.2. The sexual politics are hugely misogynist (and even worse, sometimes operate under the guise of feminism -- for another example of what I'm talking about, see Sex and the City).3. It's badly written and boring. I forced myself to finish it, but I didn't care what happened, and in a few months, I'm sure I will have completely forgotten I ever read it.For much better books for teens and young adults, check out Pamela Dean, Margaret Mahy, Maureen Johnson, Cynthia Voigt, Libba Bray, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, or even, for a junky yet romantic read, L.J. Smith."
4,good book,"This book is about when a 17 year old girl named Clare moves away. She moves to Ravensmere, English Estate. She plans on resting throughout the summer because she is going to attend a University in Fall. She begins to have Psychic visions. One leads her to go to the China Gardens around midnight. Her mom tells her that Clare and herself have a connection with the estate and all of Ravensmere is in danger... Clare might have to risk Ravensmere's future... will she?Read this book to find out. I thought it was pretty good. It's worth the time. I enjoyed this book, its not my favorite but it is very good. I would reccomend it to all of you."
5,Nice!,"I loved this book. It is very easy to read and really hard to put down. There is something for every one: romance, mystery, fantasy, adventure and more! Read it, you won't be dissapointed."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"If I could give this book an infinate amount of stars, I would. This was such an awesome story, I recommend it to ANYONE! This book had adventure, mystery, romance, sadness, happiness, tension, suspension, I could not put this book down. Liz Berry is obviously a very creative writer, and an extremely talented one too. About a young girl who goes to this place where she discovers parts of her past that she never knew were there, discovers a missing part of herself, and finds a new guy, Mark, who loves her, but does she love him? Read to find out what the Benison is, what happens between Mark and Clare, and how this book makes you think about yourself too."
5,Great Mystery,"Awesome mystery that keeps you reading on and wanting to learn more. I found that I could not put it down after the first few pages. Even though the story is set in England, so things are a bit confusing at first, Clare becomes a character whose story you are totally involved in. If you like mystery, suspense, and a wierd ending, I would recommend this book."
5,great book,"i found this book by chance at a book store and i am so glad i bought it. it was so hard to put down, i just wanted to keep reading. i highly recommend this book to anyone who loves books about young lovers. i found myself crying at one piont, it was so good. i got so into the characters lives, that i was sad when it ended. i gave it to a friend to read and she loves it, too."
3,Too Many Dates,The main plot of the story was absolutely wonderful and enchanting but I was frustrated at the amount of history that I had to swallow down. There were so many dates and places to read about. It was like a history book. I could barely finish the book because I was so bored with the pages and pages of history.
2,Way to boring,"I tried to read this book, I really did. But I couldn't stand it. It was just dates and history that I don't care about. I forced myself to read all the way to the part with Mark, because many of the reviewers said thats when it got interesting. It didn't, finally I stopped tourturing myself and put down this stupid book. I couldn't care less about what happens to Clare, Mark, her mother, the old man, or the China Garden. This book was boring and repetative and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."
1,Not what I ordered,I thought I ordered the famous novel but instead received the script of the play. I am very disappointed.The nomenclature of the ad was misleading.
1,I do NOT recommend this software,"Trying to burn imported files to SVCD. Every single one had a spot where the video went bad momentarily then audio and video were out of sync. You cannot burn a file without running thru their encoder first and I could never get a good output file. Their tech support told me to update my VIDEO CARD drivers and windows media PLAYER codecs. Then they told me they wouldn't help me because I didn't meet the minimum sys requirements because I had integrated sound device instead of a separate sound card which has nothing to do with the problem. I asked for a refund and was told that I agreed to their license when I installed the software so I guess I got taken. My advice, by something else."
1,Don't Buy - It's a waste of time and money,"I read the reviews on this product before I bought it and thought that the other reviewers were just novices or computer idiots. Well, I was wrong. I have not been able to capture a video from a VCR which should be the easiest thing to do. I thougth I made some sort of mistake so I went through the tutorial a second time (it is so fast (20 seconds) that you barely able see it).I would strongly advise not buying this software. It is not user friendly. I appears that they just wanted to get some editing software on the market with little or no instructions on how their particular program works. I also read the reviews on CNET and people said basically the same thing.Next time I will accept the reviews."
2,Disappointed,"I used to play with young kids with bristle blocks a lot about 20 years ago; they were wonderful; creative, fun, great.I was disappointed in these ""Krinkles""; which I just purchased. They look like the old bristle blocks I used to have; but they just don't stay together. It's not fun to play with the kids and have their creations fall apart every time they try to build something.I'm going to have to pay more, I guess, and buy the real thing that works."
2,Disappointing,"Our local library had a set of bristle blocks that were amazing. I had never seen or heard of them before, but my then 2-3 year old son loved to play with them after story time, so I decided to get some for home. Well, this product was more than disappointing - the pieces just would not stay together at all. I don't know whether it's because they are softer and more flexible or what, but nothing he built would hold together, in fact most of the time it fell apart before he was even finished building... what could be more frustrating than that??? No one at our library could remember the brand/ make of their blocks, but obviously they are not all the same. I would not recommend this."
5,It will keep the little guys thinking and developing skills,Purchased for my 17 month old grandson. He took right to it as he loves to put things together with his hands.It is something you can share with him or watch as he entertains himself on his own with the blocks.
4,one more review,"While the above review is of course very helpful, potential buyers and readers may want to know from someone who has actually read the book that it is indeed excellent. Neuhauser's book is in fact a ""must-read"" for anyone looking for a clear, well-written, and theoretically-informed treatment of Fichte's cryptic but groundbreaking account of self-consciousness. Readers with a healthy background in Kant will benefit most from the book. However, it is not written for specialists in the field. Anyone interested in understanding some of the basic moves in post-Kantian idealism would do well to start here."
3,Just ok...,"Not as good as ""Enzso"" (1). Some copies have a rendition of Albert of India, so I ordered an ""import"" version from NZ, but no, it did not have it. No Finn brothers or other Enz members singing on here either. Nevertheless, Eddie Raynor had a good idea arranging some of these pieces orchestrally."
3,Does anyone else taste rubbing alcohol in the new ranch sauce recipe,I have always LOVED this and all of a sudden I made it last night and both my son and I had an after taste of rubbing alcohol when we ate it. I am not sure if it is the new ranch seasoning (because they have changed it from when we used to get it back in the 90's) or what the deal is. I was just wondering if anyone else noticed this?
2,"Beware of the ""Suddenly"" part","We tried this a couple times, but we have a SUBSTANTIAL preference for the Kraft Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad. It's the same idea as this, but for some reason the Betty Crocker Suddenly Salad gave our family upset stomachs both times we tried it. In fact, my kids started calling it ""Suddenly something down your leg"", which is what it is known as to this day in our house. The sad part is the Kraft version is MUCH harder to find, but definitely superior. Check out the Kraft one - more delicious and less crampy results."
3,Fell Short of My Expectations,"I purchased these sneakers for my 4 year old. I wanted an everyday, durable sneaker for her to wear to Pre-K, but also wanted them to be cute. Decided to go with these because of the styling, however, that is also the reason I ended up returning them. Once we received the sneakers, I really didn't like the look of the one large velcro strap across the top. It was too thick and too wide. The shoes did seem quite durable, but for the price tag I wanted to LOVE them."
4,I like them because she likes them.,"I got these for my four year old. She had seen ads for these shoes and really wanted them...pink is everything, you know! I bought these because of the sale price..about half regular price. She loves these shoes. Loves, loves, loves these shoes! These are the only shoes she wants to wear and I no longer have to remind her to put her shoes up or help find them when they are misplaced. However, if I had seen these shoes in person I probably wouldn't have bought them, unless my daughter was with me, of course. They are a little heavy and a little stiff and I am a stickler about these things. I think kid's shoes should be very light and flexable. They are shiny, sparkly, sissy, girly, flowery, beautiful shoes, though, and they have made my little girl happy."
4,Harry and his Friends,"My 2 year old son is fascinated with the Harry books. Just today, he and his 5 year old sister were ""playing Harry"" -- jumping in the wind and rolling down the little hill in our front yard. I heartily recommend these books for ages 2 - 4. I just wish that someone could make a stuffed version of Harry that is as wonderful and plush as the drawings -- wouldn't that be swell?"
5,No return,Once you install an eclipse sun sade in your car you will never want to return to the old fold up ones. It take only a second or two to open and close and works great.
3,Potential to be Great BUT Needs Better GLUE,"I live in Sunny Florida so naturally I wanted some window shades to help keep my car cool and prevent fading inside my car & dash. These are easy to install, clean window, peel off, stick on then draw the shades. You can easily slide them on or off if you don't want them while driving, they actually don't bother me, you get use to them being there. The hook or latches stay in place though since you have glued them to your windshield. The ""spring back"" on these blinds is excellent! Everything sounds great right. Unfortunately, after 1 week in the sun one side came un-glued. NOW what do I do? Without the shade latches sticking to your windshield these are useless. Either they need to make a glue that can stand the HEAT or find a way to attach it to your windshield without glue. So this was all great but in the end, it is flawed rendering it useless."
4,A fine introduction,"This text covers the basics of diverse topics in sociology, though perhaps not to the depths one might like. It is nonetheless a fine introduction, and is certain to spur further investigation into this fascinating topic. Only one issue: The book is written from an entirely British perspective, so all data is about the UK. Makes it tough for American readers!"
4,Play Ability,"Good value with nice sound. Great intermediate guitar, easy touse high frets for rock or blues sound. At this price range,this guitar is currently as near as my grandson can get tohis dream of someday owning a Gibson."
1,Not up to Wheeler's usual standard,"Having enjoyed a number of Richard Wheeler's other novels, I looked forward to THE WITNESS, particularly since it is included in the 2000 WWA Spur Awards. But I found it simplistically moralistic and overbearing. While the ethical lesson is a good one, its presentation here is too heavy handed. It is also predictable--you can see the end coming for hundreds of pages."
2,Hmmmmm.....,"A few good, solid poems here. Is it just me, however, or does anyone else out there feel the emperor is wearing increasingly fewer clothes? The technical control is masterful, yes, but I miss the greater vision of AN EXPLANATION OF AMERICA and Pinsky's other earlier works."
4,"""Sweet Time Unafflicted""","First got cued to this book by Shawn Penn who took an extensive amount of time on Charlie Rose to explain the significance of ""Sweet Time Unafflicted"" from Pinsky's ABC in his own life. It is a simple, accesible beauty that Pinksy strives for and delivers, many of his poems focusing on contemporary themes and keeping their lexicon to the modern. As in ABC Pinsky builds several stanzas throughout the book on 26 word strings in alphabetical order. If as a reader you are interested in expanding your present interests into contemporary poetry the work of this Poet Laureate may be a sublimely fufilling place to begin."
5,Grest book,This textbook shipped quickly and seller emailed me shortly after I emailed him to inform me if the book had been shipped yet.
4,Colgate Fresh Stripe is great! It left a ...,"Colgate Fresh Stripe is great! It left a good minty taste in my mouth after brushing. Even though it's a tartar control toothpaste, it didn't leave any grit or residue in my mouth like some other tartar control toothpastes do. It has a flip-top lid, which I prefer. Overall, my teeth and mouth felt very clean after using Colgate Fresh Stripe. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family."
5,"Very pretty earring jackets, love them!","A wonderful earring jacket with just enough ""bling"" to make even your plain studs look expensive! I loved them so much I bought my mother a pair for her birthday. Like all jackets, they require nimble fingers to put them securely in your ear."
3,Old soul,"I'd been looking for one particular song, the title song for years. The rest of the album is interesting, but this song is the main reason I bought it."
2,Don't Get Me Wrong,"but be thankful was the only song on this album that i was feeling. the story i heard about this song was that they used to have ads in the paper saying ""come down to our studio and if we like your song we'll record it for $50"". they liked be thankful and that's how it got cut. without a doubt one of my favorite songs of all time but i think that was all he had..."
3,good in a pinch,"I once relied on these only, but I've since favored the advanced version. However, these are still good in a pinch, when I've run out of the advanced."
4,I definitely recommend this product. It's easy to ...,"I definitely recommend this product. It's easy to use and you feel the difference immediately -- and I didn't believe it at first! I gave it to my dad too, and he said the strips made him breathe much better."
5,I was amazed at how well the product ...,"I was amazed at how well the product worked, both for myself and a friend. I would definitely recommend it, particularly to people who're suffering from a cold or allergies, or who snore. I'd suggest, however, that if you're purchasing them for an adult, you probably want to buy the large size. The only problem was that they came off at night a few times, which I think was due to their size."
5,I CAN BREATHE!,"My allergies are non-existant all day with the right medicine, but once it get to be night time and it wears off I can't breathe. Decongestants make me too tired the next day but not being able to sleep from a stuffy nose is just as bad. These work great, if you've ever pulled on your nostrils to open them up, that's what these do for you all night. I chose the sensitive skin ones because I'm prone to breakouts and I've had no problems. Definitely clean your nose with a little water like it says, they'll stick much better, especially if you're prone to to having oily skin by the end of the day. Overall these work really well and I would recommend them to anyone who's tired of vapo-rub and decongestants."
5,A Big Fan,"I wish I had bought Green Banana Papers before ever spending a dime on marketing. It's a candid conversation with a talented marketing veteran who has made a career out of making the tough decisions and winning. Coleman anticipated all my questions and answered each with clarity, intelligence and humor. Where's the sequel? I don't want the conversation to end!!!!!!!"
2,Cheap product. Good for one- or two-time use.,"I bought these blaze orange bandanas for my dogs to wear during hunting season. They were starchy stiff when new (the dogs didn't complain though) and started to fall apart and, most importantly, FADE after washing. If you're looking for lasting visibility for your pups I would recommend spending a little more on a blaze doggie vest with reflective tape."
3,Necklace Addition Info,I liked the product but it the legs were too free-lance which made it noicey when walking or running and did not like the sounds so it wouldn't be worn as much. If the legs were still it would be perfect and the silver looks a bit dirty but can be cleaned
1,All of the above. Early death by paper jam error,"I've read many of the other reviews.The 4 and 5 star reviews contain many comments that are true - as do the 1 and 2 star reviews.There is no printer jam in my printer. It's simply malfunctioning. [I've followed all the internet based cleaning instructions, etc]. It was sensitive from the day we opened the box.As a consumer - HP printers are lasting me under 18 months; and typically leaving me with a larger investment in unopened ink cartages then the cost of the original printer. [Is there a market for these?]I'm frustrated with the HP quality, and their business model. It sucks from a consumer's perspective. His is going to catch up with them - as more and more people no longer see HP products as reputable/high-quality - which is how they made their name - to a company that produces junk for landfills."
2,"worked a while, now it's junk","This printer worked well for one year. Then the scanner went out. Next went the copy option. Hp support of course was no help. A month later...goodbye printing option! The paper jams and constantly tries to feed without even pressing print. The check print cartridge and check paper lights blink and nothing will print. Again, no help from HP other than the option to buy an ""upgrade"" that will surely be another piece of junk! Don't buy this unless you have extra cash to blow!"
1,Don't buy it!,"I own three of these worthless machines. I bought one for light use at my office, and it worked fine so I bought 2 more for my home. The two I bought for home worked for 6 months and now you can't print any more. It just jams the paper and gives you ""errors"". Heed the other reviews and stay away from this product."
1,A totally unreliable piece of junk,"My wife bought this thing for me as a replacement for a highly reliable but old Hewlett-Packard Laserjet. I wanted the ability to print color, and to scan documents. The machine has NEVER worked properly. Constant paper feed problems. The only way to get paper to feed correctly to print even a single page is to lift the back of the sheet with your fingers, and ""push"" it into the paper feeder.This is my second (and last ever) Hewlett Packard product. Never again."
3,"Good for price, a little faulty.","The primary concerns for a printer are met, both color and black and white, and it hardly ever jams. That's what's important.Copying is easy and quick, so that's a great bonus.However, for the life of me I can't get it to scan. Also, this thing runs through ink like ""it ain't no thing."" One thing it does to increase this ink-problem is start ""conserving"" ink early on. That means it prints as if it's running out of ink (read: unreadable and unprofessional-looking) for the longest time before the ink actually even gets that close to running out. The money you save on the printer will be gone pretty quickly on new ink cartridges, I can promise you that.Still, it's better running out of ink than jamming all the time, and for what I need it for it works most of the time. The few times I've had problems with it I couldn't fix myself I could get customer service live right off of the HP website, so it has some good customer service support.--PolarisDiB"
2,Buy another printer if you plan to print labels!!!,"If you are looking for a nice copier and scanner at a good price, then you may wish to consider this printer to purchase. If you print labels, such as: CDROM labels, packing labels, or anything else that must line up correctly... buy another printer. No matter how hard you try, the labels will not line up and you waste paper, money, and time trying to make it work. I have this printer and I am pleased with the scanner and the copier. As far as print quality, it does a good job of printing pictures and other images. Once again, it just does not print labels well!!! If you print many labels, DO NOT buy this printer. I just went out and purchased another printer (EPSON C86) to print labels and it does a fantastic job. Unfortunately, I wasted time and money with this hp printer. Hopefully, this review will save some people time and money. Look somewhere else if you wish to print labels!!!"
1,Do not buy this printer,"I have never written an online review before. This disappointment of a printer/copier/scanner has driven me to it. The printer worked fine for the first few months, though the color printing was never satisfactory, streaked with fine white lines.Then the problems began. Error messages of stalled print cartridges. Strange lights turning on. Weird noises. Printer shut-down. The only way we can get the printer to work now is to unplug it and re-boot the computer several times.Life is too short for this printer. Buy another one instead."
2,Worked until we needed new ink,"We purchased this printer from an electronics store a couple of years ago, when we realized the OS on our computer was not compatible, we just used it for copying, which was ok and it served its purpose. Now that we have upgraded our computer, the scanner works to put pictures in but when I replaced the ink cartridges, it won't print anything except a few yellow dashes or it gives an error. We spent over $100 on this a few years back and now we will have to replace it since it won't print a darn thing. Hopefully the scanner will continue to work and we will only need to buy a printer that JUST prints. I would recommend shopping around and don't be dazzled by the fact that it prints, scans, copies, etc."
4,It could have been worse,"I've had this printer for over three years, and just now it's died. While there have been a few minor issues with it over the years (unfortunately I can't tell you what, my tech-savvy boyfriend took care of everything) for the great majority of the time everything has been peachy. The scanner was simple to use, I loved the copy feature built into it, and pages printed reasonably fast - for the cheap price we paid (and after reading all of these other reviews, haha) I count myself lucky."
5,No problems at all,"I would simply echo the comments of others who have been pleased with this printer's performance. I bought this at a throw-away price, only because my (more expensive) Canon had broken down and I needed something quickly. It's been about a year and a half, and I've not had a single problem. The printer is easy to use, has all the most critical features, produces copies/printouts of high quality, and at least for me, has been totally reliable."
3,"An ordeal to set up, but OK thereafter","I adviced my parents to get this printer, since they were in need of an all-in-one solution to their printing, scanning and copying needs. A little under $100 seemed like a reasonable price to pay for a unit that would do all three. And all was nice and beautiful until the CD that the printer came with wouldn't work, so I decided to download and install the software from the HP site, which was going to take forever, because it was over 340MB in size... I ended up downloading it at work (over a fast connection) and burning a CD with it, and finally setting it up, after three attempts.Being a technically-inclined person, I found this unit to be all but user friendly. I cannot imagine the frustration of someone with little patience or limited computer knowledge. If that sounds like you, pass on this one. You will remember me if you don't. Even though it's a nice printer/copier/scanner after it's set up, honestly I think it's not worth the effort it took to set up."
1,Not for Mac,"Does not work with Mac OS X 10.6. Printing works, but you can not scan nor fax, so for an All-in-One this is like totally not working. Personally will avoid HP printers from now on, because a company that does not support it's hardware, is like making my All-in-One budget too expensive. You have to purchase a new All-in-One each time Apple brings out a new version of it's OS."
1,not worth it,"I tried this printer with an iMac G5 as well as a Dell laptop running XP professional. HP claimed Mac compatibility, but in reality you only get print functions - no scanner support - when locally attached via USB. And while it will work fine (print only) on an AirPort Express network from the Mac, there is no Windows XP support so I can't print wirelessly from my laptop. This is my third and last HP purchase. They really shouldn't be allowed to write driver software."
1,Slouching toward plug and play,You think by now plug and play would mean there wasnt a need to contact tecnical support repeatedly in an effort to get a device to work-especially when you try to run it on windows xp. But i guess hp figures its some of its customers need to be software engineers to get there products to work or spend hours with technical support and get nowhere.This product makes me believe hp engineers dont know what thyre doing
2,Don't buy this refurbished,"I bought this refurbished off a respectable dealer off of eBay,but I didn't realize that his guarantee was only for 7 days until it was too late. The USB port on the printer was dead on arrival, and I could not establish a connection to my computer. It was about 1 month after receiving the item that I attempted to install this on my computer, so I could not return this to the eBay dealer. Tried 2 different USB cables, 2 PC's and multiple USB ports, but still no connection. I'm sure this is a great printer for light to medium usuage, but my advice is to buy one of these new."
1,PSC1315? Piece of junk - DO NOT BUY - ZERO stars if I could,"50% of the time this piece of s**t hp ""printer"" is incapable of taking a single sheet of paper off of a properly loaded sheaf of even 30 pages. It physically jams, and on top of that, the program ALSO ""jams"", which means you'll be rebooting your @#! ""USB"" computer to print a single page.If you have private information to be printed, forget it. After his hp fails you, the next time you turn on this piece of junk, it may print out those pages from projects you thought were long abandoned by the machine.I can't believe a hunk of garbage like the hp psc 1315 makes it through a company's inspection process, but here it is.Do not buy this piece of s**t at ANY price."
1,don't buy this,Every time I go to print something this machine makes it an adventure. Right now the printer will only print an entire document rather than select pages from it. The error light comes on for no reason. This is the tip of the iceberg...needless to say I'm shopping around for a new printer.
3,Very good but incompatible with 64-bit OS,"Pros: A very nice output both in black, and in color. Great high-res scans. Prints very nice color photos too. Pretty fast, high quality copying done by pressing one button only (your great grandmother can do it :>) Had it for six months and no, it doesn't look like it's going to fall apart.Cons: Bought it for my 64-bit computer only to find out that no 64-bit drivers are available for it. HP keeps promissing those drivers but promises are cheap.... The message on their web site says: ""The driver will be available before the end of the year"". But it was saying the same thing last year also. Well, I am using it now with my old 32-bit system and waiting for that magical ""before the end of the year time"" some time in the future."
1,Horrible Printer,"I've installed the cd over and over and thought it was my computer that was the problem. However, I've tried it on 3 different computers at home and sometimes the computer and printer don't seem to recognize each other. It seldom works and when it does it takes up to 10 minutes to print out just one paper. Paper jams happen all too often and the scanner takes very long to run through and more often then not it doesn't work. I've owned this for nearly 3 years and it's only been fairly reliable as a copier. Shame on HP for on such a horrible product."
1,HP1315 a piece of cr_p!,"It worked fine for a while but after a few months it said it had no paper when it did, it refused to print off line and refused to delete the printing task. I uninstalled and reinstalled and it was ok for a little while then started the same thing again. If I had spent all the time I've wasted on this printer working a minimum wage job I would have enough money saved up to buy a Cannon."
2,Disposable Printer,"Totally agree - that this appears to be an awesome deal. I as well paid about $100 for it. It instantly worked with my iBook. Other than being loud and slow - it printed, copied and scanned very well. After about 8 months of use - it started acting up with paper jams now and then. After a year - it jams up each time i use it. I have to print 1 page at a time and then restart as it jams each page.Probably worth spending another $100 to avoid this disposable printer. You get what you pay for i guess."
4,HP PSC 1315,"The printer came with what it said it would. It also works properly therefore, I am satisfied. Timely shipment was made."
3,"OK for a limited range, and quirky","I've had this printer for at least 3 years. I purchased this for home use, printing shipping labels and documents, and only recently started printing photos.I've gotten my money's worth out of this printer, but it's time for an upgrade.Pros:- cheap- OK for simple document printingCons:- too large (5/8"") hard margin at the bottom of letter paper. I have to print documents past this.- 4x6 photos don't print accurately to margins on the hp paper (I was using Lightroom v1.4)- does not accept 8.5x11 photo paper (255 g/m^2) - just jams- I've had annoying paper jams in the past, but not to the level of the 1 star reviewers- invasive software (get off my system tray!) that pushes you to their website and products, but don't they all ;-)"
3,okay but only lasted about 2-3 years of low usage.,"Bought this printer a few years ago for my daughter to use for school projects, etc. Mostly used it as a copier which worked very well. Seldom used otherwise. About a month ago it started indicating a paper jam and nothing could be printed. Tried everything but now the printer is worthless."
1,Waste of Money,Bought this item about 6 months ago. I had hell installing the drivrs. Finally had to download the software abandon the CD and got the software to work properly. Six months later the machine stopped working. The power adapter is fine but the machine itself is just dead. Waste of money. Cost of cartridges will send you into bankruptcy.
1,As soon as the warranty runs out....,"You are screwed. I have had this printer for 14 monthsand now it is dead. I replaced a printer cartridge and thengot an error that the cartridge wasn't installed right.When I reopened it, the cartridge had fallen out and therewere springs and a plastic piece lying on the bottom with itand I have no idea where they came from. Needless to say it doesn't work. Now I am not a mechanical genius but I still think that if one installs a printer cartridge incorrectly it shouldn't cause the whole printer to fall apart. I can't afford $100 a year for a printer. Stay away from this one."
3,great printer but it doesn't last,"I bought this printer a little over a year ago and I used it heavily during the school year with no problems scanning, copying, or printing. I started printing on 3x5 cards and it worked great, except when I reset all the defaults back to 11x81/2, It grabs the paper, jams and will not clear the error. I can't even use just the scanner or copy function, and I can not reset it according to the instructions. Great while it lasted, but I had hoped to get more than a year out of it."
5,"FABULOUS , FABULOUS !!!!!","Simply , THE BEST , all in one , for all money categories.I dont understand , why waisting , more money , on some expencive models, when this baby, works FABULOUS !!I have had many printers ets.. through years, but this is stuning.BEWARE only that this price is only STARTING PRICE. Much more you have to spend in next days , and weeks , for papers,and cartridges, becouse , you wont to get quit , with printing , copying , scaning , when you see, this photos."
2,just read Alan G. Kirk's review before buying,"We totally endorse Alan G. Kirk's review. No excuse for this sad excuse for usability. Took it back. We believe the technical support ""person"" is an avatar running the Eliza program. The only reason for 2 stars rather than 1 is that the printer works. Other alleged functionality is not really there."
1,Don't buy it,Printer's quality is bad. It printed everything skewed. The tech support guy could not fix it. Also the printer driver blue screen my machine twice.Look somewhere else.
2,HP doesn't do Classic,"I've had luck with HP printers in the past. This one prints and scans ok for the low price BUT if you're a Mac user, beware. I use OS X, and the printer worked, but when I tried to print from a Classic app (Photoshop 6) I got an error message. When I contacted HP support I was told that they don't support Classic and that I would have to reboot and print from OS 9 if the app wasn't OS X native. A real pain, as I use Photoshop a lot but have no real need for the upgrades. I think this information should be on the box, but it wasn't. Instead the copy says it is OS X compatible. Classic is part of OS X, and there are a lot of Classic apps still out there."
3,Software shut computer down,I bought my HP PSC 1315 at COSTCO without researching. It worked nicely when first installed on my Athlon processor with Windows XP home. The next time I turned on the computer the installed HP software immediately kicked my computer into restart. Very frustrating was the blue screen error message that remained up only long enough for an idiot savant to read.I have spent too much time on other computer equipment that didn't work and after a few quick checks decided that there must be a printer/scanner that will work without hassle and returned this one.
4,Foreign music that rocks,"this is a very good compilation cd of concerto moons greatest hits. the 2nd disc with 2 songs is ok but the band rocks hard and even though it is not in english you can still feel the emotion. listen to the samples and then purchase. even if you have never heard of them, this album is highly recommended."
4,Yes .. A good foundation IS important!,"While I am not sure what people look for exactly in books like these, I can tell you that while this book may not be full of demonstrational techniques, it IS an excellent source for information on the history of Bujinkan taijutsu and how it came to be available to all of us westerners in the United States. Roots are important, and this book will become a beacon lighting the shadowy history of the ninja as their path transforms and stretches into yet another century. No matter what you think about the author, the importance of his writings are like the cornerstones in the foundation of American Budo."
4,ok book,"This book has some good information in it. It has a lot of information about the old traditions of ninjutsu. It shows a few pictures of how to do some ninjutsu moves, but no book can teach that. I've studied ninjutsu and it's a lot more detailed than the book shows."
3,ninja book,This is a book that gives some good historic information about the japanese and ninja tradition. But for the most part its just an introduction into ninja.
4,A broad overview of the Ninja arts,"This is a very good book detailing Hayes's training with Master Masaaki Hatsumi. It provides an American's perspective on the art, and is something of an introduction, rather than a training manual. Very entertaining and informational."
5,a very good book,"This the one of the very best books on ninjutsu ever released in the U.S. some of the past reviews on it are very misinformative and written by people who have probably never had any serious training and are just looking for demonstration techniques to show their friends, when in reality this book is much much more. It talks about the history, people, training, and occurances that came to shape ninjutsu into what is is today. If you are just looking for watered down techniques and death touches than you had better look the other way, but if you are looking for an aw-inspiring book to read and re-read on, in, and between the lines than your search is complete because this is exactly what you need."
3,I am not really happy with this book.,I expected more from this book.It is not a real ninja book.It's an itroduction and autobiography!! Although it was quite funny but Stephen should be arrested for what he and the ninjas did in Japan.This is his only book that I am displeased with.
3,Looks good from far away,I was somewhat disappointed with this chandelier when I received it. It seems to be made of some sort of molded plastic and one part was cracked but it was not worth returning it since I could fix it. The color was a bit too yellow for my taste.The stained glass globes do not align perfectly and they took some work to get them to look even and the whole chandelier seemed to lean to one side slightly. The hanging chains do not look anything like the picture and would not stay in that position.I installed it anyway and we may get used to it eventually but I would not give it more than three stars (and that is generous.)
1,I cant believe it was just the brass part,I recieved this on time and was eager to replace my chrome version of another make. All I recieved was the brass piece. This is not a fixture. I called the company and they were absolutly no help and said that there was nothing that they were willing to do to help. :(
5,Essence of fine-art photography,"Essential, hugely informed, lucid guide to fine-art photography by a master dedicated to his craft. Vital."
5,Is this Ansels Adam's 'The Print' for the modern era.,"Before you waste one more sheet of printing paper, before you waste another minute with scanning and color management, before you waste another second with a bad workflow ... get this book. You will save the price of it in one week just in paper and ink alone. And maybe you will keep your sanity. This is bedtime reading, coffee shop reading, and ""lightroom"" reading. It is well written, well printed, and straightforward. I have followed George DeWolfe's suggested workflow to the letter, and it works! Don't buy another book until you have this one, and have read it two or three times."
1,Bukowski?,"This was a poor mix of ""IRONWEED"" and ""BARFLY"", not clever at all. It is just a copy of the dialog but loses in spirit. Sorry can not reccomend this one in any way!"
1,"Bad, judging by the first part","The first part of this series, at least, is not very good. It emphasizes the sordid aspects of ancient Rome and ignores many of the great accomplishments of the Roman Republic. The conflict with Carthage, which was a major aspect of Rome's development, is hardly even mentioned, leaving out great figures such as Cato and Scipio. Images are used in the wrong historical context. It would be possible to make a much better video history of Rome than this."
3,Christian bias again,"Joe Montegna needs serious help with his pronunciations (it's a ""consul"" not a ""council"") and much of the material is slanted with a pro-Christian, anti-Pagan viewpoint, particularly in the second half of the tapeset. The purpose of the tapes is not to explain the Roman empire, but rather why we're so lucky that Christianity overwhelmed it and put and end to it. Some material, especially the visuals, is good, but some quotes are anachronistically used and some pictures are mislabeled. Enjoy, but don't expect this to be fair to the Romans."
1,"PLEASE DON""T BYE THIS VIDEO","This is only for peole ,who is resurch Roman history and for students of historical institute."
5,Laumer's Best,"While I've always enjoyed his lighter works, such as the adventures of Retief, ""The Time Trap"", and the Lafayette O'Leary tales, Keith Laumer's finest work was in his stories of a lone man battling against overwhelming odds, usually against gigantic organizations or conspiracies. And, while I adore ""Night of Delusions"" and ""The House in November"", Keith Laumer's finest novel was ""A Plague of Demons"".The action is first-rate, the science fiction concepts are solid and well-thought out...and exciting. And the story continually expands, like an onion being peeled in reverse...much as the Lensman stories of Doc Smith did. Bravais (the hero...and I do mean HERO) seems to be investigating a minor matter at story's beginning. By story's end, however, both story and Bravais have undergone astonishing changes!Buy this book...read it...keep it...you'll come back and read it again!"
3,Take note this is from 2003,"i was really disappointed as I have a 2004 regular and 2005 studio, that this was from 2003. I wanted to try an updated version."
4,"It's great, but...",The album is great and worth the money. however track 4 is incomplete and cuts off about half way through. I would like someone in the amazon staff to take a look at this. Thanks.
4,Great gift for 3-10 year olds,"Gave to my nephew who turned 5. All 3 generations played with the toy as well as cousins aged 3 to 9. Everyone found themselves to be quite competitive. Pretty sturdy and alot cheaper than cornhole, but the one plastic piece that holds the metal frame together at the top, snapped during assembly. We placed a small wood dowel in the metal frame to hold it together and it was ""good as new""."
5,"My boys love this sturdy, fun bean bag toss!","This bean bag toss is very sturdy--can not be easily knocked over like another game I purchased in the past. It has two games in one--traditional and baseball. My three boys, ages 5, 3, and 3 love it. I wish it came with a few extra bean bags (it comes with 6) but I can always buy extras later."
1,Bag Ball,"Bag ball is cheaply made. Flimsy and unstable structure, plastic rods, poles and brackets to put together. The plastic poles broke while my husband was trying to put together. Very disappointed in the quality of this product. We will be sending it back for a refund."
1,Not what I thought it was,"I bought this for my two boys to play with. It is only one board, I thought it was going to be two boards. So what happens is only person plays at a time. I thought it was going to be like other yard bag games, but it wasn't. We were disappointed. It might say in the description it is only one board, I'm not sure. I didn't remember reading it or I would not have bought it. The quality of the games was good."
4,Clockwork shifter....,"....does everything it's supposed to do, regardless of weather and conditions. Used it to replace an old shifter. Works great after years of daily use!"
3,Okay,They are usable but do not want to work well with my Alivio rear derailleur that is a couple years old. I don't know if its the age difference or something else going on.
4,Good value and easy to install.,"I don't think these inexpensive shifters will last 10+ years like my last ones, but they fit my 8 speed mtn bike, were a good price and easy to install. Delivery was fast too. I'm crossing my fingers they'll last 2 or 3 years. If so, I'll be very pleased. Word."
5,Just what I needed,"The shifters on my Trek mountain bike quit working - I could only use 3 or 4 of the 24 it has. After fiddling around a lot thinking it was just a misadjustment, I finally decided the Shimano shifters that came on it were probably busted. I considered taking it to a bike shop, but decided to try these first. I used to be a bike mechanic, so I had no trouble taking the old click shifters off and putting these on, then making the adjustment. They work perfectly and I am off and riding again! Saved a bunch o moolah over the bike shop. The installation and adjustment instructions were clear and easy to do."
4,Shimano Shifters,"There don't seem to be a ton of 8-sp shifters around anymore since newer MTB have gravitated to 9 and 10 cogs... I run these now on a Raleigh M80 after I had the original shifters break. I put these on myself in less than an hour and have done some pretty hard trail riding with them... I have an STX front, and an LX rear derailuer.They work pretty good but every once and a while on hard climb I will get a ghost-shift (usually up a gear)... could be the deraileurs or some frame flex... not sure?They are easy to adjust over time using the mini-adjusters at the handlebars.I went to a MTB demo day and rode lots of expensive equipment all the way up to a total Sram XX gear'd bike... and unless you go huge lengths and cost for incremental performance gains, I would say these shifters will do just fine.Finally, I really like that the downshift is with the thumb (under), and the upshift is with the index finger (over)."
4,Great for what it is,Used these shifters to rebuild an old Specialized hybrid and they work great! Not top of the line Shimano but great for the recreational/casual rider.
5,inside dyslexia is a must see!,"In this film we see how 3 new york city children negotiate their shoolwork, their personal lives and their dyslexia. The film is very well done and could be a great source for discussion among educators and family members of children with dyslexia.BUY IT FOR YOUR SCHOOL!"
5,AWESOME! - Everything You Didn't Know You Didn't Know About PR -,"I was so psyched when I found this book by ""accident"" when it first came out. Here was an author who understood that you didn't need to ""sell out"" to market yourself in the world - irrespective of what others might say. You had choices. You could maintain your personal integrity AND be successfuL. Susan has created an easy-to-read, uplifting and thorough guide to successfully increasing your visibility. This book covers what you didn't know you didn't know about publicity - for yourself and your clients. I highly recommend ""Sell Yourself Without Selling Your Soul"" to anyone in business, starting a new business, or looking for a new career."
4,Not just for women...,"At last, a really helpful book about harvesting free publicity for us non-sharks (male or female). For me, Susan Harrow's ""Sell Yourself Without Selling Your Soul"" provides just the right mix of mechanics, chutzpah, and heart. It's a dog-pitch-dog world out there and Harrow shows how to capture media coverage with relative ease and without the sleaze."
2,Don't Try Trial Version,"I'm SO frustrated...I downloaded the Trial Version of DC3 (to give it a try, obviously) and it allowed me to create something (pretty easily--no complaints with version 3) but DIDN'T show the watermark that would eventually show up on the printed version!! So when I printed my masterpiece (har har) it said ""Disc Cover Trial Version"" across the label. Awesome. So now I have to go re-create the label in another program AND wasted a sheet of labels. I'd probably buy this if I weren't so annoyed with this COMPLETE waste of my time."
5,Communicating effectively with examples,When I first start reading the book I was about to stop reading since it seemed too simple. But I kept reading and see that there are techniques and well chosen examples of how to communicate with your peers and boss. The communication profiles section is a must read. After this section you'll see you can't stop reading the whole...
1,Garbage,"This book did not help me at all.....If anything, it should the handbook of how NOT to communicate in business. Just a bunch of hash and rehash I'm sure the author found somewhere else. Save your money and buy something more useful."
3,Real SATs? NOT!,"I certainly agree with what the commenter, who works for Princeton Review, says, ""nothing prepares you more for the real thing than doing real problems on real exams. That's what this book offers.""The problem is that, with a few exceptions, these are NOT ""real"" SAT questions. They are Princeton Review exams that are similar to the SATs, but not as well-written (nor as hard) as those prepared by the pros at ETS. Plus, the explantions for the verbal answers are not terribly edifying (the math answers are OK.) Princeton's own Cracking the SATs is a better book because its practice drills and tips are brilliant (Joe Blog, etc), even though its tests have the same problem. (Note, however, they are far superior to those of Kaplan and Barrons, which isn't saying much.) Recommendation: buy Princeton Review's Cracking the New SAT 2005, and get a free copy of a genuine SAT when you register for the SAT."
3,Real SATS? Not...,"I certainly agree with what the commenter, who works for Princeton Review, says, ""nothing prepares you more for the real thing than doing real problems on real exams.

Recommendation: buy Princeton Review's Cracking the New SAT 2006, and get a free copy of a genuine SAT when you register for the SAT."
2,THESE ARE NOT REAL TESTS!,"I picked this up for my younger brother without reading carefully only to realize that these are Princeton Review tests which as my high school senior friends told me have a reputation for being unrealistic.I also bought him the actual Official Guide to the New SAT which has REAL tests. The tests are quite different. Sure Princeton Review's book has the actual types of questions, but the similarities end there. Besides this, the Princeton Review book has a number of errors.The online materials included with this book are not very helpful either. I advise that you spend your money on the real book from the Collegeboard."
3,good prep but unrealistic content,This book contains good practice material but some of the topics in this book (such as matrices) will never appear on the new SAT as announced by the College Board.
5,get this book,this book is a good straightfoward book with 11 practice tests and explanations.you should DEFINITELY get this book if you're taking the new SAT.
5,"Fantastic, just like the World Champions NYY","Super comfortable, eye-catching and everybody who sees them wants them. well made, too. I am going to buy more."
4,Comfortable slippers,"I bought these slippers from another website for about $10, and for the price with free shipping, what could i lose? So i bought em and i got em and they were comfortable as hell. The bad thing about these slippers is that you cannot use them to walk outside much, they will tear easily if you use them in the streets. They lasts me about 1.5 years, so they were a good buy to me."
5,Plush Yankees slippers,"My wife loves these, I bought them even though it's a mens small it fits lady size 8 shoe."
1,Apart at the seems,"I was quite shocked to look down at my foot and see that the stitching on the slipper was coming undone. Pretty soon the entire rubber sole will be detached from the rest of the slipper, effectively making them useless. That I purchased these less than one month ago (and using a gift card given me on my birthday) makes it worse. I'll try and get a refund for them but alas, I am moving to the Dominican Republic soon and the receipt is gone. I don't know if I'll get any satisfaction other than warning others about this product. Perhaps most surprising is that this is a Reebok product and I certainly expected better. Caveat emptor, and all that."
3,"Product is great, service is bad.","I was pleased to receive the product I ordered. However, not only was my product delivered almost a week late when I paid to receive it a day before Christmas, but UPS promised to refund my shipping fees and they never did. I was very unhappy with the shipping service. The Yankee sandals were meant to be a Christmas present and I was not able to give it to the person until a week after Christmas."
4,Great alternative to expensive brands,I used this skin sheild on my son. He had a nasal feeding tube and the tape that holds the feeding tube in place severly irritated his skin. This product drastically reduced the skin irritation. My son did not like the smell but the smell disappeared as soon as the product dried. Good product for my money. Similar products in drug stores cost a lot more.
4,WOW!!,"Chenoweth has a great, well trained voice. I love listening to her sing musical theater as well as opera. A great voice like that can do it all and sound effortless. She also is a wonderful actress, and it comes across in her recordings. I love it!! If you want to be able to do that to, check out this series:Voice Lessons To Go v.1-4 The Complete Set"
2,"This cd sure had a great voice, but a poor choice of music","I have read many wonderful things about this young actress. When I first heard of this new cd, I was real excited with the thought of buying it. Well the verdict is in, the voice is great, but the song selection is not. If only K.C. could have choosen better material.I can find no fault with K.C.s' voice. Ii is in top form. I think she has a signifianct future. She will probably be another Barbara S. I really believe she has that great talent. I just wish she would try to please us, her fans with better cds.Well, until something better comes along, i'm your slave, Kristin!"
5,Wonderfull personality and voice and choice of songs.,"Kristin Chenoweth is amazing. I have most of Ms. Chenoweth's recordings and this takes the cake. She has always received attention for her supporting roles (Sally in Charlie Brown, Nancy D. in A New Brain, Precious in Steel Pier etc.) but now she finally has a chance to shine!She displays the versatility of her voice with great flair. Singing torchy jazz songs (""Daddy"") and sweet romantic tunes (""Going to the Dance With You"") and even some opera (""The Girl in 13G"")I was about to start typing about all of the highlights... but the truth is every song is a highlight. Many times with an album such as this I will program my cd player to skip certain tracks. I listen to every track on this album and I relish and treasure each moment with Ms. Chenoweth."
4,A must for fans of the genre.,"This is the perfect showcase for the multitalented vocalist. She pays compliments to standards, and makes a few unknown songs all her own."
4,Great singing never goes out of style.,"I heard Ms Chenoweth (love that Welsh name) on Garrison Keeler' radio program and was most impressed, and knowing that I would be laid up at home for a week following planned surgery, I ordered a copy of this album to help me pass the hours. I was quite satisfied with the quality, as good or better than what I had heard on Prairie Home Companion."
4,Chenoweth shines is debut!,"Kristin Chenoweth has a voice that is not easily forgotten. Songs like ""14G"" shows all her vocal ability, which is amazing! Not only does she have a strong middle voice, but she can hit the high operatic notes also. Yes, she sings it all!! I wasn't sure at first it was her until I heard her sing it live and it was amazing. With great remakes like ""My funny Valentine"" and ""How long has this been going on"" you have songs that get stuck in your head, but you also have songs like "" If you hadn't but you did"" which is a great song that is faster which applies to a lot of guys ( not all, but some). THe CD start off strong with ""Let yourself go"" which is a great big band song. It is a great album that everyone must own!!"
4,Great CD!,"I truly enjoy listening to this CD. Kristin Chenoweth's vocal style and abilities are very well-matched to the songs selected for this album. If you enjoy classic, older-style Broadway/popular tunes, I would highly recommend this CD. Ms. Chenoweth has a bright, expressive voice and does a fantastic job with this material.As with any full-length CD, there are a couple of songs I am not as crazy about, but that has to do with the songs themselves, not Ms. Chenoweth's vocal performance. Overall, I love this album and have listened to it several times now, since receiving it as a Christmas gift last month."
4,A Little Too Close To Home,"What a great, inoffensive, pick-me-up this collection of cartoons is. John McPherson really knows how to bring a smile to your face. From the magician who really has sawed a woman in half to the classroom presentation of a meteor shower, each of the cartoons in this book will have you either laughing hysterically or nodding in agreement with it.A great book to have around to read on a down day."
1,The hacksaw thats too comfortable.,"Pros. This is a portable, comfortable good quality hacksaw.Pros. tension knob works easily.Cons. The larger diameter handle placed the knuckles closer to the vise & metal being cut.The user must make the final cuts /strokes using very gentle pressure to avoid injury to the knuckles(skin removal).Con. This saw did not cut straight & had a tendacy to cut to the right of the line.Con. the tapered design has serious drawbacks and makes cutting large wide items difficult & only a portion of the teeth are used.Using your second hand to guide the saw very difficult."
4,Bi-Dyke Liliane,"Leanne Franson has gathered in this comic book, several stories she had made in different periods of time. The book starts with little Lilliane and her unfortunate hamsters, and then moves on to a first date story, lost and new love(s) e.t.c. I think that as the title suggests, this is what can be found in several of this books stories. Lessons of life, through experiencing losses, searching for love, discovering her sexuality, asking herself...In the meantime, the reader is enjoying marvellous stories,with sketches who are simply made by a complicated and skilled cartoonist. Although as Franson states in the book, she never meant for these stories to be published, (and this fact only comes to show they are personal and frank), i am very happy friends convinced her otherwise. It is one of the books i am more than happy to have run across, and Franson, a cartoonist i look forward to see her work."
4,Moving through the boggy lagoon to the blue sea,"Creeper Lagoon's first album ""I Become Small and Go"", was a CD filled with every imaginable instrument possible, while at the same time still maintaining that lo-fi feel, sort of a happy-go-lucky Sebadoh/Folk Implosion. Beneath the layers of headphone sounds are catchy and intense rythms whose meaning is at times lost in the music, which isn't always a bad thing.With the new EP, you wish they would hurry up and put out more. Songs like ""Centipede Eyes"" and ""My Friends Adore You"" show their growth as quite ingenious studio workers, who I can only imagine put to good use their Dreamworks cash. Their music is often the kind you might hear at a fun little party where everyone is laidback but energetic, no airs are put on, but they want to lay out some good sounds. The power of their guitar work can be much more truly appreciated live, where they are currently out with The Dandy Warhols."
2,Watered-down Must Pardon...,"...should be the title of this EP. I tried to get into this, I really did. I gave it chance after chance. I'm also not of the camp who feel betrayed by all of the post IBSAG CL output. This is just an uninspired set that screams 'identity crisis.' Wait, it doesn't even have the conviction to scream...this EP half-heartedly whispers it. Sorry guys, but in the end a turd is a turd, and no amount of that opulent Dreamworks polish can hide the smell."
1,bland and boring,"creeper lagoon needs to decide whether they want to be commercial or artsy, it's that simple. right now they sound like a watered down pavement or worse yet, the wallflowers jr. i don't care about the dreamworks money, no one should. radiohead just made an album full of uncompromising songs for capitol and the flaming lips made the best record of 1999 for warner brothers, so let us not speak of money, sell out, or indie vs. major labels anymore. musically, however, this record is just a big wash of nothingness. give us hooks, give us ambience, for god's sake, give us something. the songs are so half baked, it's like they're hoping that if they add some effects to the mix it will actually help the mix. i also know that i'm not the only one who thinks that singer no. 2 should not sing. somebody get that guy a harmonizer or a pitch bender quick. to sum it up, yeah they do sound like the wallflowers, and, um, that's not good."
1,Milo Talon,Get an other profession....it is nothing I ever read from Louis L' Amour.It is boring and painful to the finish
5,"Mellow singing, childhood memories","I am writting promted by the review of Dan Gergen because this record brings memories of my own childhood as my mother owned the record (among very few others...) and I cheriss it both as an object (double vinyl) and for the music. Wonderful mellow renditions of Mr. Tambourine Man, Lay Lady Lay, originals like Christofer Robin almost bring tears to my eyes whenever I listen to them. It reminds me of my late mother and it is something I wish my one year old daughter will also love, first as sound and when she learns English as songs proper. Thank you Melanie for your beautiful voice and soul-soothing songs."
5,Part of my childhood,"I was introduced to Melanie from a very good friend, via this album. I really did identify with so many of her songs, to the point where I was wearing the sleeve out not just with removing the vinyl, but just constantly reading and re-reading the sleeve notes. I remember covering the whole gatefold sleeve in sticky back plastic, and it still sits sandwiched in a pile of special records that I've kept, but not added to, for years. There have been so many other compilations of Melanie, but nothing betters this - I just wish someone would release this on CD!"
2,Horror? More Like Bore-er!,"While the concept of a couple grizzled 'Nam vets battling it out at the behest of a strange supernatural power is kind of cool, what we get here is page after page of boring character interaction and convoluted rationales as to why all of this is happening. But the cover is cool!"
1,Possibly the worst book I've read,This is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. It is ridiculous from the beginning to the end. I'm sad a tree died to make the paper for this book. Do not waste your time.
4,"Good, but misses occasionally","I first discovered Tayo a couple years ago and was impressed by his mixing talent and solid tune selection. In this latest release, his mixing talent is in full form, but his tune selection misses occasionally. For example, the first CD's opening track, ""Hacker"" by Anthony Rother is an incredibly weak opening, cheap sounding electro with a weak bassline that just doesn't fit in with the rest of the CD. The other misstep I can remember is dropping the Roland Clarke ""I Get Deep"" acapella where he did, he did a great job with that on Annie Nightengale's show a while back where it fit in perfectly with some Plump DJs track, but here, the lyrics in the song cut in with ""Electrofunky"" right while Roland is saying something, not smooth Tayo... Other than the few quibbles I have mentioned though, it's a solid release with great mixing and deep, phat basslines. I'd say worth the purchase in spite of the few minor missteps he makes."
4,"Good, but not stellar","I'll say one thing about the Jaguars: these guys're *solid*. Pretty much everything on this disc is at least good. Their covers are solid, ""Beat Train"" is an absolutely viciously good, catchy little thing, and even ""My Girl"" can be forgiven.That said, while the Jaguars are pretty good, it all ends up feeling somewhat underwhelming...they don't, for example, have the level of original-composition ability of (say) the Launchers, Mops, Tempters, or even the Spiders, really. Thus, while this album's a fun listening experience, there's very little that's *revelatory* here ('cept maybe ""Lady Jane,"" which'll cement once more how much better Japanese recording facilities were in the 60s).Verdict: A fine album, but definitely at a lower priority than contemporary efforts by more creative bands, especially at prohibitive import prices."
3,KAteys review,"I would say this book is too sad, her brother dies, and then theres a big fire. I really don't like the way she stayed in Luckey Diggins and didn't go to Massachusetts, that was kinda dumb. Otherwise this book was easy to understand, and it was good."
5,"Hey, you!!! Read it!","Before I read this book, I thought that people would go West and look in the dirt, and there would be a gigantic gold nugget just laying there. I also thought people would just go West to find Gold, and I never once thought people came to do anything else besides look for gold. Boy was I wrong. Karen Cushman shows what it was really like. Most books just talk about finding gold, but Lucy and Karen, together, show that that wasn't the only thing on people's minds. Karen Cushman is such a talented writer, I can't say enough about her. I loved ""The Midwife's Apprentice"", and ""Catherine, Called Birdy"", is as great as the other two so far. I couldn't put any of them down. Karen Cushman is a great author, and ""The Ballad of Lucy Whipple"" is her best yet."
1,Mrs. Brown's 4th Grade Class,"I constantly lost interest in this book. The little details took pages and big sentences. The girl, Lucy, wants to move back to Massachutes but doesn't do it when she has the chance. That was frustrating! This book was very different from the real world. It has characters going in and out of it. I gave this book 1 star because it was very difficult to understand. The Ballard of Lucy Whipple was made for children and no one I know understands it. If you like detailed books and you're up for a challenge, you should read this book."
1,I though the book was boring with way to much detail.,The book was dull and carried on too much with one subjuct. Karen decribed the chatcters and their emotions very well to the point were it was like they were life like. The events though and sometimes the not so importent charters were a little confusing.
1,OK,"THis book is OK as good as Karen Cushman can write. All Cushman writes about is ungreatful and bratty kids. The ending is good, though."
1,Eeeeeck....,Ok....Maybe it wrong of me to hate this book..... but I hate this book! It was soo boooring! I fell asleep twice while reading it. I personally don't fancy this book but I'm not sure whether you'll like it or not. If you like stories about the California Gold rush and men trying court a 15 year old's mom--- try this book. Ugh.
3,A bit disapointing,"I got this book as a gift as as soon as I saw the Author I was heavily pleased.The problem is the main Character is not like a girl would be in her situation, she's all together too modern.Also (( If you've never read I'm warning this ruins the book. )) When her brother dies...she doesn't show the emotion one might if your brother died. And her insistant pleading with wanting to go home annoyed me horribly so much I hardly re-read it, only when I'm bored of all my other books.It did have some good points like when she befriended the town weirdo, though I think they tread on the subject of abuse lightly. And the Author did have a way with PUTTING the words so that it did get a 3 star."
5,One of the greatest American books,"This is one of the greatest books ever. You can hardly imagine how fascinating this book of pure science is to read. I first read it many years ago and absolutely wore out my paperback copy, reading it over and over. I just bought it again, after all these years, and in the very first few lines remember why I loved it so much."
3,Not so interesting for kids,"I bought this book to read to my son and really it's long and tedious and I don't think we'll finish it. For one thing, it goes by the billions of years theory which we don't subscribe to since there really isn't evidence, just speculation. There is lots of good scientific information for someone who wants to know a lot on this subject but I don't think we'll remember most of it. I thought we were buying the edition with photos, which would have helped, but it wasn't. I think we'll try Answers In Genesis'The Ocean Book (Wonders of Creation)which also has a study guide available and good, descriptive pictures."
2,Not worth buying,It is marketed as spicy and frankly it's not only not spicy but it's quite bland. I have fond memories of Buffalo Bills Shredded Jerky as a kid. This completely failed to meet my expectations.
4,Chew...chew...,Surprisingly good. Can taste the soy though. A bit too much. Cut back on that and you'll have a perfect product.
2,Buffalo Bills Spicy Shredded Beef Jerky,i like the spicy jerky very much but the amount in each cannister was poor and was not worth the money i paid
1,Meat Fuzz,This product was not as expected. It is a fuzzy product and is mostly dried fat. I mean it looks like the stuff they would clean off the machines after a day of processing beef jerky. I did not identify much meat in this stuff. It is very salty as well.
1,do not purchase.,"If you like REAL chew like I do, I love to pack it in my lip and use it like you would dip. Then this is not for you, this has such big hard chunks in it that's it completely not enjoyable to have in your lip and you might as well just chew it like regular beef jerkey.I am completely dissatisfied with this product and am going to just toss it in the trash can."
1,Terrible Shreded Jerky,This product is horrible and not as described. I love shreded beef jerky and that that's what I was getting but this is more junks of jerky mixed in with some shreded. I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants shreded jerky because that's not what this is.
3,Still not worth it,The only saving grace would be if you were buying it for a kid that wanted the 'illusion' of having dip.
1,Not worth buying,"Even worse than the ""spicy"" type. I will at least eat the other flavors but this, I gave it away."
2,I Ordered Spicy,"Way too sweet. NOT spicy at all. Is jerky dust. Would have kept if slightly larger pieces and had an actual spicy taste, Sent back."
3,its ok,"The jerkey tasted great however I feel the cans were very underfilled. All the cans were under half full and I know its says .44 oz but good grief, two pinches and its gone. Over priced in my opinion."
2,SLOW SHIPPING - LESS FILLING,"Shipping is terrible. I've paid for 24 cans of this chew to arrive in two days(due friday) and it arrives the following week monday! But on top of that, it seems that there are a few cans that have less than others. Not worth the money."
2,Good taste Less filling,"This was the most flavorful jerky I have eaten, but all 12 of the containers were less then 1/2 full. It took 2 to make almost 1. I would like to try it again, but I would be wondering if I would get the same amount. It said on the package .44 oz it was not close."
2,Tasty but.....,"Dry. Not Jerky dry but Old Dry. Taste isn't to bad and not sure if I'll buy again. Only eat 2 cans in 2 weeks, Sitting on the shelf waiting."
2,Tasty but disappointing at the same time...,"As I write my first review on Amazon, I enjoy sucking on the flavor of my 6th of 12 cans... each having nearly the same flavor yet severely lacking consistency in the portion (1/3 of a the can is ""full"" when opened in my current can versus 1/4 of the can in some instances and always below 1/2 in others). Moisture content is consistent but poor... most cans are as dry as Vegas in August and only one had a hint of moisture (maybe Colorado in summer?). The flavor is fairly consistent but to be a ""chew"", the cut is decent size overall but far from perfect. I'll finish these cans for the flavor and forget the variables and likely keep the cans to shred some of their Teriyaki flavored jerky in the food processor that they sent as a sample to place in the cans. That was tasty in ""stick"" form and the way jerky should be served! Overall, not very happy so would have to give it the thumbs down... Sorry Bill."
1,"Abridged, so beware","There is no information indicating that the 2nd book in this collection, The Magic Faraway Tree is abridged. Inside the collection, the contents page indicates that this book is slightly abridged. What they mean by slightly abridged is 6 chapters at the end of the 2nd book have been omitted. I would not have made this purchase had I known that in advance! Disappointing."
4,The Faraway Tree Stories,"I agree with Veronika that it is a shame that the book was changed. I am a teacher and read the original to a class and every child wanted the book. I ordered them copies from Amazon in the UK and the children were very disappointed with the new names, etc. They loved the book, however, and most of them read their copy many times and/or their parents read it to them. The four stars is for this edition, not the original. If you can get a copy of the original (used) I highly recommend it. There are some things in the original that I would recommend discussing. An example of this is Dame Slap and why we, hopefully, wouldn't see her slapping a student today and why."
5,More like the Faraway Treat- this book is a huge treat!,This book can only be put into these words- simply amazing! This book is all about 3 kids who have their lives turned upside down when they stumble across the amazing Faraway Tree!I have read the original book of The Faraway Tree and I liked the names better however that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get it! This book is a MUST HAVE! So get it!
5,One of the most haunting screenplays ever written.,"Taxi Driver was one of the seminal films of the seventies. It broke many boundaries with its use of violence, and it was critically applauded. It was, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. The script is fascinating, especially to read the bits which were left out of the film."
5,Weaving reality,"Paul Auster first came to my attention with an NPR series oftrue stories collected from ordinary people, I Thought My FatherWas God, another excellent book.If you like Anne Tyler's books but like a gritty twist this willdelight you. I hope Mr Auster takes good care of his health andlives a long prolific writing life."
4,Sooo easy!,"My kids love mashed potatoes. These are sooo easy. No melting butter, just add hot water. We love to have these as a midnight snack. Just add shredded cheese and some sliced green onion and ummmmmm good. Would have given them 5 stars but they're not quite as creamy as hoped."
4,happy,This program does exactly what it is supposed to do. I had a little trouble with my cd burner but that had nothing to do with this program.
1,POOR SOUND QUALITY,The software was easy to set up and use. The quality of the digital copy is not good enough to save the songs on my Ipod.
4,NOT BAD,The software is pretty good. The resultant CD is not close to the quality of a real CD original. It is easy to use and will provide car qulity CDs.
3,"Can,t use label maker","I tried the Spin it again on a trial bases and worked fine. Bought it and not working as trial version. You can not print labels from Label Maker SOFTWARE, ALSO i COULD NOT GET THE PLAYLIST TO DOWNLOAD. yOU HAVE TO BUY THEIR LABEL MAKER PROGRAM."
4,Excellent but not perfect,"I am using this product with the ART USB Phono Plus preamp to capture old vinyl and reel-to-reel tapes to MP3s. It's been the best product I've used so far, but still leaves a bit to be desired. Althouh the track detection works well, it still requires a bit of manual adjustment on must albums. In particular, it tends to treat some low-level classical sequences as silence, which wouldn't then be captured if I didn't make manual adjustments. I'm sure it would work perfectly on pop and rock music, which has a much more limited dynamic range.I do recommend this project, with the caveat that if you're using it for classical music you may need to either adjust settings somewhat or make manual adjustments during the track detection process."
2,Expected more from Sennheiser,"I've listened to a lot of headphones over the years, professional and consumer. After doing a lot of research from reading reviews, these sounded like a great buy. I expected a lot from Sennheiser - but the one review that said the bass response is terrible, is right! I was very disappointed. The treble is too high and the bass is almost nonexistent. They sounded awful. I am not a fan of Apple's ibuds at all, but they actually sounded better.Sony's earbuds at the same and lower price have better EQ range and sound better, though the cords do disintegrate after a few months."
3,not enough bass,These headphone are nice but they dont have enough bass range for me (am a bass frek) but otherwise i recomende they have a crystal sound and they sound pretty good on a ipod.
2,Not so great...,"I purchased a pair for my Nano about eight months ago, based on the strong recommendations in the media and on this page. Although I was somewhat disappointed that the improvement over the Ipod stock earbuds was negligible, I chalked up my inability to hear much of a difference to the damage to my ears caused by standing in front of a bass guitar amp (at full volume) for several years... I use my Ipod about 6-8 hours/week while commuting by bus and/or train. The right earphone has failed - fortunately I kept my stock earbuds. They are working fine, so the problem is definitely the CX300-B and not my hearing!"
2,very good sound. very bad cord design,"i dont understand the weird cord setup, its extremely uncomfortable and hangs awkwardly. the sound is better than stock ipod earbuds by farrr. if i didnt get a good deal off ebay on these i would return. Sennheiser should fix this problem! stat!!"
1,Waste of money,"I bought a pair of these earbuds based on the reviews I read here, - big mistake and waste of money - as replacement for Sony MDR-ED21LP. They are constantly falling off, regardless of the foam size tried. Try to squeeze them in and it's like scraping your ear canals with a blunt object. I went back to the Sony - less than half the price of the Sennheiser, more comfortable, stays in your ears and sounds great!"
4,good sound great price,The cord is longer on one side so the cord stays out of your way. Unless youhave a pocket in the middle of your shirt or pants.
3,They are ok,GOOD BASS BUT CAN NOT HOLD VOULUME DISTORT TERRIBLY I AM A SOLDIER AND USED TO NOISE BUT FOR TRAVELING PURPOSES NOT TO DISTURB OTHER WHILE FLYING GOOD SOUND
3,Sennheiser CX 300B In-ear Monitor,"These earbuds sound really good, but wires should be more robust, like Shure that I also own. The foam inserts that it came with are already deteriorating (wearing holes) barely a month after receiving. I am not happy with that and might have to return using warranty."
2,Thought theyd be better,"they are very tinny sounding. I thought theyd have more bass response than they do, but oh well. although they DO highlight ALL the highs very well. hopefully they will burn in over a couple months, if they dont i will be buying something different and getting rid of these."
1,PEOPLE BE CAREFUL !!,"I ordered a pair of Sennheiser CX300-B expecting to get the real deal only to find out that I had been totally ripped off !!The name of the seller is ""BESTELECTRONICSDEAL"" who shameslessly sent me a cheap knock off of the original product.Be careful not to buy from these dishonest seller which by the way is also selling the ""Creative EP-630"" brand that look just like the Sennheiser's.Go figure,right?.These people even have the nerve to enclose a copy with some photos of their cheap replicas warning you which one is original and which one is not! can you believe that?Bottom line is:take your hard earned money and buy from any other seller but ""bestelectronicsdeals""..and please alert others.You have been warned!!"
1,"Great sound, no longevity","These are the first bud headphones I ever bought. They were to replace the oh-so-crappy-sounding default iPod headphones. I bought 'em from Tiger Direct (big mistake) and they have a no returns policy short of the items being defective.After screwing around with the rubber parts that cover the headphones and go into your ear, I finally got the hang of them. The problem is, after 3-6 months some of the wire covering got a hole in it. Not sure how, because I'm pretty careful. But within a few weeks of that, the headphones were hanging by the actual electric wire on the inside and predictably stopped working.So the sound on these things is great. The problem is you'll be back on Amazon looking for replacements within 6 months."
1,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED,"If you care how your music sounds, I recommend choosing different headphones. I had been using a $20 pair Phillips earbuds. Decided it was time to upgrade a bit, but these sound awful, I will never use them and J&R Music will NOT accept them for a return. There are two basic problems: (1) the sound is flat at the lows and mids and without depth; (2) they distort easily. I just don't get how these are as popular as they seem to be. The only plus is that they are light weight, but if it does not sound good, what's the point."
3,"Great ""IF"" You Ain't On The Move","I'm very fond of Sennheiser headphones and have had a set of the ""over"" the ears type for some time. I do prefer the ear buds, when they fit well they isolate you a from the world a bit more, which can be good (or bad) depending. If you are on an airplane, these are great. What I don't like is moving with theses. The cord length is asymetrical so that the length to the left earbud is 53 inches, and 60 inches to the right. Some people like this but on the two occasions I tried to do my ""walk"" I found this not to work for me and headed back home to swap. I just found them to pull out of my left ear when on the move."
1,Worse sound quality I've ever encountered!,"These headphnes just sound terible! Its all mids, no bass and a little treble, sounds like an AM radio to me!OK, they are quite comfortable, but really-the sound quality is not worth the comfort..."
5,Clean Audio,These headphones Rock! Very comfortable and have good soundstage. The bass response is quite surprising and not overloaded. The highs are crisp and sound balanced while the mid-range is very clean. I am not an audiophile but for the price of these earbuds you dont need to be to appreciate them.
3,Great sound but very annoying wires and lots of wooshing,"The sound of these is as good as the Sony MDR-71 BUT:- the wires are stiff and annoying - they get in your face. the Sony wires are more convenient.- When you do any activity or when you move in any way, you get a lot of swooshing noise. jogging is a real uncomfortable task with these. Trust me on that.- The wires keep getting caught in your cloths (the wires are ""sticky"" for durability but the result is that the buds get yanked out of your ear)- One bud doesn't fit well and seems less sealed then the other ear.so I'm going back to Sony MDR 71. It's worth it even if the wires degrade a little faster: I'll just buy a new pair every couple of months."
2,Pay Attention to the 1 Star Sound Reviews,"The August 2007 issue of MONEY Magazine included these in a review of 6 noise cancelling in-ear-headphones. They listed them at $90 with ""only moderate sound quality; not a good choice for the price"", and described them as ""the bass is not clear and the treble sounds too bright"".I tried them for about half the the MONEY Mag price. It's a toss up as to whether they are worthwhile at that price.If you are at all picky, or listen to clasical music much, you should visit the 1 and 2 star reviews that comment on the sound quality."
5,Worth Every Penny,I had used Sennheiser full size headphones in the past and have been happy with the performance. I have a Samsung YP-T7. The earbuds that came with the device were not very good. I thought I would try and get more from this device. I have been very impressed at the sound from these soundbuds. The bass is unbelievable. and the highs and midrange are just as impressive. I paid $54.00 with shipping. The normal retail was over $80.00. I would like to hear the competing Shure product but found they were way out of my price range.
4,Great for the price,"I've purchased several earbuds over the years, and these are still my favorite in terms of sound quality and comfort. The price has dropped considerably and it's a great value today. I removed one star only because many of today's earbuds have mircophones."
3,They're OK...,"They block out noise fairly well, but in a quiet room the phones themselves don't even sound as good as my $10 Sony earbuds. They don't handle bass very well- sort of a crackly (cheap) sound."
4,Good replacement for sony earbuds,"Prior to purchasing these earbuds, I used the sony fontopia MDR-EX71 for over 2 years. I only decided to purchase new earphones because the sony was falling apart.I got them at a discounted price, which added points to the purchase, because it fell within my budget of 40 bucks. As advertised, the bass is really good with these earphones. Sound isolation was a lot better than the sony fontopia, I only had to set the volume on my ipod to 2 fifths and I could barely hear my roommate babbling. When set to half volume, I was blissfully in my own world.If the offer is still valid, and the earphones are below 40 bucks I would recommend that you get it. The usual price of 90 bucks is definitely overpriced. If you were willing to fork out 90 bucks you could do better with other earphones with better sound isolation and better sound quality."
3,Good Earphones,This one is good...good bass and noise blocking.But the length of the left cord is very short.Hence the left earphone keeps popping out of the ear if I turn.The right one is fine.I have a zune and by using this earphones I get to listen loud music in NYC Subway roughly at 9 volume level.No need to crank up the volume in the device and it saves battery too!!!!But for the cord I like the earphones.
4,Good Sound and Feel,"Like the earbuds, sound quality is good, and when properly fitted (comes with three different size ear caps) noise cancellation is decent. Needs stowage pouch for ease of travel!"
4,Good Quality for a reasonable price,"Sound quality is decent,but the wire's are kinda thin and spindly.They get tangled constantly if your moving around."
3,Decent head phones for the price,"Bought these to replace a pair of Shur headphones and I can't complain about the quality. I use them daily on the train into work. I don't think they are made as well as the Shur's, but they were half the price of the pair I replaced. Only complaint is that if anything bumps or rubs the cord, you hear it. Can be quite distracting. Sound quality is good and aside from things bumping the cord, the isolation is also good."
