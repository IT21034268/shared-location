2,Yeah could have been better,I have a LG CU500 this headset sucks with this phone. I have to answer my phone the same way before I connect the headset. Every time I try to answer with the headset it rejects the call.
1,find a different headset.,"this thing sucks. when i use this thing, the person i'm calling says my voice is muffled. you can hardly be heard on the other end. you have to pretty much be in a quiet room talking loudly in order to be heard okay. compared to the H700, this thing makes your voice seem very low. i have compared this model to other motorola headsets. i am currently using the H700 because i can be heard."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"Shipping was fast, I am satisfied with the seller. The product was Junk. After one day the sound was terrible. After one week It was in the garbage because it no longer worked at all. I will never buy another Motorola product."
4,It works,"This device is not the greatest in the world but it works. It dangles from my ear and does not fit very well but, it works. For now and for the price it is a working device. Now I will know more of what to look for in the future. It is a basic BT device and for the limited wear I use it for, it does the job. I refuse to wear it all the time waiting for Scotty to beam me up anyway!"
3,H350 Bluetooth,"First off i would like to say This headset is made for people with big ears.The sound is kind of distorted but ok.It often falls off your ear and doesn't stayin one position it can really get annoying especially if your in mid conversation.the strap behind your ear gets uncomfortable at times the battery power isn't bad but,i don't suggest anyone with small ears to buy this..."
2,Motorola,"Feels like it is falling off the entire time it is worn. Works in a pinch, but not my favorite."
2,"Basic headset, questionable volume.","A basic headset, probably overpriced as originally listed. I received mine as a ""free"" incentive with a phone purchase some time back. Was worth that price!But beware - this headset has inadequate volume with Samsung phones. While it pairs fairly easily, the sound volume is such that it is unusable."
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Although the ear piece was very comfortable the sound quality and noise distortion was less than acceptable. It would be better to spend a little more money and get a better quality head set, one with noise cancelling."
4,Works Well,Seems to work well. Only a few times has the person on the opposite end said i sounded like i was underwater or very far away. Most of the time it works good and it is one of the only headsets that does Bluetooth 2.0 which is nice.
1,Frommer's European cruise,The book was not up to date. It had information from 2006. It didn't mention the Queen Victoria and the newer ships. I thought I was going to get current information. I wish I had ordered the Fodor book.
5,Comedy at It's Greatest!!,"Adam Sandler has to be one of the greatest comedians of our time. Coming from HBO standup comedy to being one of the most sought after comedians, reflects greatly upon himself. This edition contains great hits, including Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Bulletproof, which also stars Rob Schneider in two of the three. Another comedian who is up an coming in the comic business. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a long night filled with laughter!"
4,A great debut,"I can't quite believe anyone in the U.S. has ever herd of Nojahoda. They are a very new British alternative punk band. I think they have a great future. It's hard to tell why if you just listen to there more alternative track's such as the title track 'Nojahoda'. If you then listen to tracks like 'Drown', you will then understand what I mean. A great prospect for the future. ""Freedom to Freak"", long live Nojahoda."
5,EXCELLENT FUN FOR ALL,A 'LIVE' 20 minutes of sheer delight for the Beatle-maniacs or nostalgia fanatics ...... a definite addition to any collection
2,Found it very dry reading!,Am struggling to finish it as it is not keeping my interest. To much fantasy. Seems like poor Prue is stuck with someone who is just a day dreamer.
4,a diamond in the rough,"not your typical romantic comedy, this one is a bit less traditional, a bit more stylized, but zany and wacky as befits Tom Hanks with some fun Meg Ryan thrown in the mix. I absolutely love it, but must add a disclaimer that 1) if you consider yourself very picky about movies, or 2) only like standard Hollywood fare, you might not enjoy this.I suppose you could say it's just plain off-the-wall.'Nuf said."
3,Silly concept but hey it's Tom and Meg!,"Joe Versus the Volcano is one wacky film of the '90s. This was the first film with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, the other two are Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. This particular film is not as good as the other two but still engaging. Hanks and Ryan have the most amazing chemistry together, you can't take your eyes off of them. The concept is so silly but hey this a romantic comedy, you can call this film a guilty pleasure of sorts."
5,"""Once upon a Time"" People!","A lot of people trashed this movie as being ""unrealistic."" Well, DUH! It starts with ""Once upon a time there was a guy named Joe."" There is some excellent acting from Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (playing THREE extremely different characters!!!!) and the performances of the supporting actors (Dan Hedaya, Ossie Davis, Lloyd Bridges) are priceless as well.If you have the brain to look for them, there are some really deep insights and life-affirming moments in this film.One of my true favorites that I can watch over and over again."
4,Liked it,"I'm one of the ones who actually liked this movie. I can understand why to some could seem like a bad movie because it is kind of weird. But I also saw some profound truths and moments of connection and revelation in this movie. My favorite scene was that of Tom Hanks standing up on his raft in the middle of the ocean at night looking up at the huge moon, saying ""Dear God....thank you for my life. I didn't know how big...."" That was worth watching the whole movie. Georges Delerue's musical score was a plus."
5,A beautiful film - one of my favorites,"Joe hates his life (for good reason) and its only until a life threatening illness happens that he confronts and faces his fears and is willing to live the life he only dreams of. Meg Ryan is great in all her roles and Tom Hanks is flawless. This movie has many different levels to it - light comedy, fantasy, fairly tale but ultimately its a story of a man who needs to look inside to find the answers to his questions and affect others.Scene of Joe in the hotel with ""blue moon"" playing in the background as well as the scene in the restaurant when Joe dates the ""first"" Meg are my favorite. Would love a soundtrack but could never find one."
4,Just a fun movie,"I missed it in the movies, but after seeing it it on STARS, I knnew I had to have it in my collection !!"
1,Joe Versus the Volcano,"I have never taken the time to review before but simply had to for this movie. I love Tom Hanks and couldn't imagine this being so bad. This was sort of like watching Harrison Ford in ""Mosquito Coast""--how is it possible that such a good actor could be in such a bad movie. I kept thinking this would turn but it never did. I loved the line from another reviewer, ""if you only have 2 hrs to live watch this movie because it will seem like 2 lifetimes""...so true. Not a clever plot, not funny acting, not even funny sight gags. Painful..."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Tom and Meg have a good chemistry when making movies, but we were not as spleased with this one. If had good parts, but when it was over - we left a little disappointed. We had bought the movie based on the excellent ratings - I would not have rated a 3.5, but not a 4 or 5."
3,The Lamest and Silliest of the Hanks/Ryan Pairings,"This is the lamest and silliest of the Hanks/Ryan vehicles, not worthy of either of their talents.Contrary to what one viewer said, Meg Ryan CAN act when she has decent material to work with, (I can remember when she played Betsy Stewart Andropoulos on ""As the World Turns""), but this movie is NOT it. I've seen TV sitcoms that are better than this movie.I think of movies with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan to be akin to old movies with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Not QUITE that good, but almost. I consider these two to be this generation's Hepburn and Tracy.If you're looking for a GOOD Hanks/Ryan movie, go with SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE or YOU'VE GOT MAIL instead.If I could give JOE... 2-1/2 stars instead of three I would. Three is too generous."
3,"A silly ending, but a great movie.","The first half hour of this film will make you wonder why on earth they call it a comedy. Tom Hanks, a sad little man in a sad little job, diagnosed with a terminal illness. And the end will make you cringe, it's such sophomoric nonsense. (I won't give it away.) But the middle? Stunningly beautiful -- philosophical, funny, bittersweet, visually poetic. It's one of my all-time faves. Meg Ryan playing multiple parts is quite good, and Tom Hanks is very good (brilliant at times). If you're looking for a straight romantic comedy, don't watch this. Head for ""When Harry Met Sally."" However, if you're in the mood for something slightly fantastical and fable-like, you'll really enjoy this."
5,Just For Fun!,"Joe Banks, played by Tom Hanks is in a dead-end job. His life is the pitts and it is about to get worse as he finds out he has a 'brain cloud' and is going to die. A very wealthy man finds out about Joe's condiction and offers him a proposal. How would he like to live like a King for a few weeks and then sacrifice himself to a volcano god? Interesting.Joes decides to go for it, but on hi journey he meets Meg Ryan who gives him a reason to live. Does Joe throw himself in the Volcano?This is just a fun story and with Tom Hanks you know it will be worth your time to see. Don't expect some deep hidden agenda, but just sit back and wait to be entertained. That's what you'll receive in ths flick. A great relaxer leaving you with a smile.Shirley Johnson"
5,Phenomenal Movie!,"I have loved this movie since its release. I've owned a copy for years and bought this copy as a gift for friends who really enjoy it.It's a perfect blend of the silly and surreal.It's Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks at their best. Ossie Davis, Lloyd Bridges, and Abe Vigoda are jewels in this crown.WARNING: This film is not for those who simply sit and watch a movie. If you are an active moviegoer, I recommend it."
5,You either love it or hate it,"My brother, sister and I are all very different people. One of the very few things we agree on is that we LOVE this movie. It's a fable, and there is nothing subtle about the symbolism, so it might not go over with highbrow types. However, the story is refreshingly unique, it's often hilarious, and with the right mindset, you will enjoy learning life lessons from Joe and the rest of the cast. Meg Ryan shows herself to be a fabulous character actress, and Tom Hanks plays a mean ukulele.Die hard fans with an iPod or iPad should download some of the podcasts that cover the movie.I wish it were available to download on my iPad so I could watch it on plane trips. It's one of the few movies that I know I will continue to enjoy for decades."
2,terrible movie for today's youth,"In school my english teacher forced my class to watch this movie. No one liked the movie, even after we analyzed it. If you sit back and take in everything in the movie you will find the movie has many symbolic features in it. Pay attention to the crooked road in the beginning. That figure, the crooked road, pops up in many places like: when the lightening strikes the sailboat, on the wall of Joe's home, and the path on the island.But like in my title, Joe Versus the Volcano would mainly go over all of our youths' heads. But it would also seem unusual or even like a low-budget film to those who are passive viewers."
4,Delightful Sleeper,"Tom Hanks gives one of his best comedic performances here as Joe, a hypochondriac who's led to believe he's dying from a ""Brain Cloud."" So he strikes a bargain in which he gives up his humdrum existence working for an artificial prosthesis factory with loud, buzzing flourescent lighting, to live a life of luxury for several weeks until he is forced to become a human sacrifice by hurling himself into a volcano to appease the gods of an island populated by orange soda drinking natives of a bizarrely comical multi-ethnicity. Somehow it all pulls together.Meg Ryan - whom I normally cannot tolerate - here is charming in three different roles.The great Ossie Davis has a small role as a chauffeur, and, charmer that he is, nearly walks off with the entire movie.A delightful sleeper that passed under most people's raider. Worth a second look."
5,Ten Best of All Time,"I would just like to say, that after forty something years of watching movies, this one has touched me more than just about any other. To those who don't like it, I say, get a heart. This movie is a lot deeper than it appears. If you just are looking for a straight comedy, then shop elsewhere. If you truly want to see one of the greatest movies ever made, check it out. The characters are great (all of them), the screenplay is fantastic, the visuals are stunning, and the acting is suberb. It is a movie that needs to be watched at least five times to really get it. I have watched it at least 20 times, and get more each time."
5,BUY IT! CHERISH IT!,"Amazon.com needs to replace the Maltin review with Roger Ebert's review. Ebert gave the movie a rating of four out of four stars and a big thumbs up. Judging by the customer reviews on this page, Ebert was more in tune with the film's authentic merits. I would say that this film is one of the best I've ever seen. It has changed my life philosophy. I would advise you to buy it NOW and to count yourself as lucky for owning a copy. If at all possible, also buy it on laserdisc for the full glory of the letterboxed widescreen version. I hope and pray that it will be released on DVD soon!!!"
5,Classic Tom Hanks,"The best descriptor I can come up with for this movie is ""quirky."" This is a movie that would never be made today. This is an example of the creative chances the 80's and 90's made with their movies. If you've never seen it you may not like it. A lot of Joe vs. the Volcano's charm is in it's nostalgia and innocence."
5,"A delightful movie, I had to own it after seeing it","This is an allegorical movie, quirky, funny and surprisingly memorable. The first pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (who plays 3 parts, the women who come into his life). Tom plays a hypochondriac who has a depressing life. Given a diagnosis of just a few months to live and a chance to live it well, he launches into finally having the courage to do something with his life. Along the way, his innate innocence and goodness changes people for the better and gives us a very satisfying and humorous ending. Zany cameo performances add much to the movie. Appropriate for families, adults and young adults. I recommend everyone see this movie, you will be quoting it forever."
5,For those who feel they are losing their souls.,This is a surprisingly well done film of self discovery. It is charming and funny as it follows the average Joe through the doldrums of everyday life toward a romantic adventure on the Pacific. Watch for repeated symbols as Joe identifies his fears and over comes them. This movie is flawless and never loses it's wonder. Joe Vs. the Volcano is the world's most underated movie. It is a true work of art.
2,Este dvd ya no es lo que esperaba,"El primer volumen fue bueno pero en este segundo ya se desvio completamente del tema de los ovnis,casi no salieron videos ni imagenes de ovnis, sale mas sobre otros temas como el calentamiento global(unos 8 minutos) y lo demas son temas de unos dioses aztecas y temas sin sentido,lo unico rescatable es unos 8 minutos que habla sobre el caso roswell, de alli me aburrio tanto que hasta me dormi en mi sofa, ojala que si sacan un tercero hagan algo bueno y que vuelvan al tema central de los ovnis.Este dvd no vale la pena comprarlo para tenerlo en la videoteca,esta bueno para verlo y revenderlo nada mas."
2,Be careful when ordering this,"I wouldn't say this is falsely advertised, but I ordered two six foot Belkin AV20000-06 PureAV Digital Optical Cable (6 feet) and thought I was getting a 12-foot optical cable with this companion order. What I got was a ""digital coaxial"" cable. It's an over glorified cable for an RF jack and not for the optical outlet. Clearly, this was my mistake - but the descriptions are very similiar - i.e.Belkin AV20000-06 PureAV Digital Optical Cable (6 feet) versus Belkin PureAV Digital Coaxial Audio Cable (12 Feet)."
2,Do you like hospitals?,"The packaging for this product is ridiculous. After finding that I *could not cut it* with a knife I noticed a pull-tab to open the back. Simple enough, except that the ends of the cable were still entombed in the front of the package. They still had to be cut out, and the now open back had a sharp edge around which I had to work. Not a good place to have to use a lot of force cutting!It's no wonder people cut tendons opening packages. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, injuries from plastic packaging resulted in 6,400 visits to emergency rooms in 2004.This is one of the worst packages I have encountered."
3,"Good basic control, limited zoom control","This unit is very compact, easy to mount on a small tripod or mono-pod handle, and of excellent quality. If you only want to zoom to a fixed level then start capture with a fixed zoom, this is a great bargain. If you want to zoom while shooting, be aware that it only supports two speeds so your zooms will be very jumpy if you initiate or stop zooming during the capture. There isn't a way to support smooth variable zoom. If you want crash zooms, this is fine. If you want precise control, this isn't the control for you.Good news is that most cinematic fare is captured without active zoom, so this control is adequate for many uses."
3,Good to have despite unused features.,"This is really meant for camcorders or cameras with electric zoom, etc. All it will do on the DSC-R1 is turn the camera on and off and press the shutter (including a half-press for focus). On the other hand, that's enough to make it very useful for tripod shots.What would be better? A way to control more aspects of the camera (ISO, image size, etc.) remotely would be very nice--hello Sony!--maybe in the near future?"
4,Good basic remote for panhandle,"I bought three of these remotes for the three cameras that my group uses to film theatre events and weddings. The theatre events sometimes requires us to be positioned in weird positions (sitting in chairs) which means we may not be able to reach the zoom ring. The RMVD1 was able to fill in the gap by allowing us to stop/start recording and zoom in and out during shows. The zoom is not as smooth as the zoom ring or the expensive rocker type zoom controls, but you get what you pay for.The cameras that I have used this remote include PD170s and a VX2100."
5,Works Fine!,"I don't know why people complain about the clip, its not that big to be a distraction. I'm glad that the thing is available so I can use my still camera on a heavier tripod when outdoors."
1,Three Thumbs Down,"I watched this movie with my 2 sons. We were all disapointed even though we like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, we like to watch Happy Days reruns with Ron Howard, and we like old movies. A much better choice is ""Tom and Huck (1995)"" which is destined to become a classic."
2,Huckleberry Finn with ron howard,"Not impressed when you sent a DVD you would think that they would check to see if DVD is in its holder and not moving around the case and getting all scratched up by the DVD holder, I got my copy this morning and as soon as I picked up the package I could hear and feel the disc moving around, when I opened it I was right so I put the disc onto the clips that hold it to see if there were any problems with them and found they were good so this gave me the s***s good and proper, SO HOW ABOUT MAKING SHORE THE DVD IS PUT INTO ITS CASE PROPERLY> NOT HAPPY"
1,Utter crap; avoid like the plague,"The manuals for this product are confusing and incomplete. Actually, that's probably too kind.I've set up computer networks for a living for the past 15 years and I could not get this thing to work. It seems they've decided to violate every convention there is for a device acting as a bridge. While I could get a directly connected PC to talk to the bridge device, it never was able to associate and pass packets with my WiFi device (in this case an Apple Airport Extreme).I don't recommend this product."
1,Bad quality,"Bought this due to the low price. Bad idea - unit malfunctioned within a few weeks. The ethernet port basically died. The port light would blink red, then stopped working altogether. Its also telling that the Motorola docs dont even document ""red"" as an option for the Device light. I would advise folks to stay far away from this unit."
1,worthless - just like motorola's other wireless devices,"I hooked the bridge up to my xbox after maybe 40 mins of configuring.I have a pretty standard setup. cable modem to wirless g router (netgear), with machines connected via wire and wirelessly to the router.Here is were it gets interesting. I am able to ping (and access) my xbox (which sits behind the motorola bridge) ONLY from a devices hooked up via wire to my router. I _cannot_ ping my xbox from a wireless device.This may be fine for ppl using the bridge for xbox live, however I use my xbox for streaming media from my pc's.I would highly recommend staying away from the motorola and getting a netgear or linksys gaming bridge. saving $20 on the motorola is not worth the headaches and lack of functionality."
5,Great Review,Book was received quicker than I thought it would be. The book is in great shape. Very happy with my purchase.
4,"Great Help, getting outdated...","This has helped me much better than the BOS third edition. It is laid out well and is much more understandable, but it doesn't conform (naturally) to BOS-3, so that is a bummer. I don't know why a 3rd edition hasn't come out for the new BOS.Even though it isn't up-to-date, I have still found it very understandable, easy to set up, and a great help at my beginning transcription. All I have to do is check the 3rd edition to see what differences there are (not quite as easy as it sounds). The CD is mainly what I bought it for and that is priceless.If the Book of Style came out with a list of updates and a workbook, I would be all over it. As it is this is the next best thing."
2,puzzled,"I want to say I like this book. There are elements in it that are striking-- insightful. But I found myself feeling burdened by the tone of the book-- an incessantly polemical stance that Crowley takes on so many issues. I don't disagree with her; indeed, I agree with a good deal of what she says about first year composition in the university. But there is already so much didactic material in English studies and in the academy, in general. This book made me think of a relentless school teacher telling everyone where our previous education has gone wrong."
3,a bit self-involved...,"After a while, the polemical tone of this book becomes irritating. Crowley evidently thinks most highly of her own previous writings. She does make an interesting case for abolishing first-year composition as a requirement, and then she re-makes it, and re-makes it, etc. There is something distastefully showy about this book."
1,Refund!,"Why did I buy this book? Crowley manages to quote and cite herself enough to make me realize that her intended audience must be herself! At least she's honest: these ARE ""polemical essays."" But do we really need more polemics in higher education? This profession isn't polemical enough already?"
1,half-star,"Some of these essays are familiar, and are no fresher in their reprinted form in this volume. Crowley's polemics are tiresome and her remarks about the role of first-year writing courses in the college curriculum are neither radical nor particularly useful. I can imagine educators cheering at certain portions of this volume, but the after-effect is that it was merely another exercise in reading, an occasion for an author/educator to ""vent"" spleen on the profession. It's hard to admire this work."
5,Adobe 6.0 Pro,I found this product to be well worth the upgrade. Documents look better and also compress much more effectively. The collaborative parts of this product work well. It is well worth the upgrade. I have not had the problems others have suggested in these reviews.
1,Won't install on Dell 8200 XP Home Edition !!!!!,"Be very, very careful before you buy this product. Kept getting error 1303 about 3/4 of the way through when I try to install Acrobat 6 Pro on Windows XP Home Edition. Acrobat indicates in the error pane, that I do not have sufficient privileges for the C:\Documents and Settings\All Users area, and that I need to be an administrator. I am an administrator. I shut down all stuff that might be running in the background that might be accessing the above directory. The only thing I left running was the ""Windows System installer"" from the MSCONFIG program that comes with XP. Still no help. I even tried to install to another hard drive ""H:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 6, and the error comes up again saying the same thing and says it was trying to install on drive ""C"". What the heck's going on here? No help from Adobe or Microsoft!!! I'm going back to Version 4."
4,Go with the name brand,"There are other (low budget) products that can make PDF files, but nothing beats the real thing. I've now moved on to version 8, but any version is good."
4,25-watt appliance bulb,No problems. It works. What more can I say. It does it's job fine. Too many words required on these.
2,Works for microwaves (cabinet mounted),It works pretty much as you would expect for an older style bulb that puts off a not so insignificant amount of heat. What bothers me is that their lives are only a few months or so if left on all the time.
4,Works well...wait...see the update.,"UDATE: 11/3/2011 Having bought this only in August...it died in the brand new receptacle I also installed at that time. So, I would reduce my from 5 stars to 4. I could possibly do a 3, but it could be that my stove since it is rated for a 40 is the reason this died. My engineering son could answer that...or possibly Google is relatively short time.Good replacement for the original 40's that came with the microwave. Brighter actually and at the price purchased reasonable. Turns out the under the microwave lighting is hugely important for cooking and the 40's fried their receptacles even though they were rated for 75 watts...clearly a poorly sourced part by GE."
5,Great Resource,This resource is for teachers who are interested in understanding science as it pertains to the classroom. It provides information as to what students need to know by the end of each specific grade level. I highly recommend this excellent resource for those who are pursuing National Board Certification and/or those who are pursuing excellence in science instruction.
2,Not a replacement for the 32S-II,"My old 32S-II died, and I wanted an RPN calculator to replace it. My ancient 15C is still running fine, but I keep it at home so I don't have to haul calculators back and forth. My antediluvian HP 45 is still functional, but barely. I really like RPN calculators.I bought a 33S despite the funky keyboard. I found I could adapt to the oddball chevron key layout, and the tiny decimal point only bothered me occasionally. What drove my 2 star rating is the poor life of the calculator. It lasted barely more than a year, and then completely died. HP nevermore. I guess I'm stuck typing silly parentheses into my new $10 Casio fx-260 Solar. If that one dies, I'll just send in some boxtops and get another. ""Ave atque vale,"" RPN."
2,"Okay, But not the old HP quality","Had to get this calc for the PE Exam. Basic, but not my old HP11 and 15 calcs. Calculator came with dead batteries and covered in sticky fingerprints from the factory. They may be making great profits, but seem to be sacrificing quality for cheap parts and labor. And what's with the limited stack and hard to read comma? If you need it for the PE Exam, get it, otherwise save up and purchase an older model on ebay."
2,No 32s/Eats Batteries,"I had a 32s for many years. When it finally died, I got this one. The calculator just feels cheap. It also goes through 2 cr2032 batteries every other month whether I use it or not. (My 32s lasted 2-3 years on a set of batteries)."
2,Two subjects: reliability and usefulness for PE Exam,"First issue:Check some examples from the manual first (say, conversion of coordinates polar<>rectangular). It did not work for me. See if it works for you.As for calculator overall, nothing special. Just run of the mill calculator with too many things piled up on the keys.Second issue:As for PE exam (where it is, for some reason, one of the two calculators in the list), a calculator lighter on features is more than sufficient, and you will not waste precious studying time to learn the quirks of a calculator."
1,Reconsider...,"I bought this one after my HP48 Graphing calculator got stolen. HP must have changed how their RPN works because I've made a number of calculation mistakes (getting different answers a number times in a row) using this calculator. I also hate that it has no ""undo"" function. That really kills. I really miss my HP48 and now seriously considering buying a used one."
1,Not good for Texas Instrament users,"This calculator, although it might allow you to see what you are typing in, it does not allow you to edit anything once you have entered it. This is by far the most terrible thing about this calculator. I would say that if you are not used to using HP calculators, don't get this one. Get the Texas instraments TI-30X-IIS, you will get alot more for your money."
2,mr,you really don't need to buy this product if you don't have time to read through its text-book like manual.
3,Becareful before buying,"It looks like a good scientific calculator but u needs to give some time (1-2 weeks) to understand it. It is definitely different from regular calculators which we use at high school and undergrad. In my case I don't have much time to read and understand the manual, so it is almost no use for me."
3,Very tricky to use,"This calculator HP 33s is kind of slow to actually get to master. But it's the best allowed at the exam, so I guess we got no choice. It's taking time to master for me probably because I was to use to the HP 128 GX (which has a bigger screen)."
2,Superseded - Get the HP35S,"OK, but poor quality and has been replaced by the MUCH better HP35S. As of now, it is not yet sold by Amazon (but available elsewhere)"
3,Great Calculator--Poor Construction,"I have been using HP calculators since 1985, when I bought a 15c (my 15c lasted for almost 20 years!!!). Well, the 33s is SIMILAR to the 15c, and I would be very happy with it EXCEPT--the keys keep getting jiggly after one year of use! HP replaced my first 33s free of charge, but only gave me a 3 month or so warranty on the second one. Now the second one is experiencing the same problems (aggravating!!!). I plan to buy yet another 33s, and buy the replacement plan from Amazon, because I guarantee the keys will fail in a year."
1,Keys click but nothing happens,"Imagine pressing a key (like Enter or the decimal) you feel it click, you hear it click but nothing happens! OK maybe it was just a fluke, maybe I just thought I felt and heard a click - this time look at my finger as it carefully presses the Enter key: Yes I heard it this time, Yes I felt it this time, No nothing happened this time! Oh, if you press it just right it works but just because you hear & feel a click don't think it actually made contact. Recommendation: Forget it."
3,HP 33S review,"I am glad to get an RPN calculator again for $50; I bought this one only because the keyboards on two 32SII's failed. The human engineering of the 33S is poor: funny slanted key rows; dark characters on light background makes shift function colors hard to see (HP: please go back to light on dark); shift key arrows have poor contrast; tiny display periods and commas are hard to distinguish. I'm disappointed, but I'll just have to get used to it."
2,Get the HP 35s,"I was dissapointed with three flaws in this calculator. 1. In the equation mode, equations can only be edited by back-spacing over the equation and retyping the equation. Not so with the hp 35s, which is what you would expect. 2. When reading the display, a comma can easily be mistaken for a period. The display in the 35s is much better. 3. The key-board is a departure from the classic HP style and feel. The hp 35s is a classic design. Like the hp 33, the HP 35 is also allowable for use in the PE exam. If it's a toss-up, get the hp 35."
2,Disappointing,"The decimal point problem is real, but I'm getting around this by setting the display for using scientific numbers with 1 digit before the decimal point.The more troublesome problems are the computational errors. When converting from cartesian to polar coordinates, the calculator often returns a wrong answer if the starting x value is small. After I discovered this on my own, I eventually found it online as an obscure addendum to the manual. A related problem occurs when performing calculations with complex numbers. The answer may or may not be in error by pi. I called HP and they agreed that the algorithm is defective, but refused to refund my money or do anything about it. It looks like HP's approach is to sell off all their inventory of calculators as is, defective or not, and then get out of the calculator business.This is disgusting. What happened to the old HP that always want to get it right?"
2,Beware!! Only 4 registers!!,"I was used to the HP 49G, which has an effectively infinitestack size. I just assumed that this would too, but noooo!The top of the stack is 4. Type in the 5th variable, hit enter,and the 1st variable is gone!For me, this makes the calculator very unattractive. Had I knownthat the stack was only 4 registers, I would not have bought it.Also, like everyone else on this page says, the decimal point isway too small."
3,Improved Display,"HP has changed the display to materially improve the decimal point display. Still, it's far from the quality of legacy HP calculators like the 32SII and the HP11-HP15 series."
2,"No thanks, I'll have to buy something else","I'd use my old HP41 series but I can't for the PE exam.Cons- green and purple text on silver background hard to read.- 26 subroutine labels far to few for a programmable calculator.- one letter program identifiers far to short to remember.- tiny decimal point.- Vee-shaped keyboard layout.Heck, I really don't like this calc.Pros. Turns on."
2,"Best one for the PE, but tough to use","I believe this is the only approved programmable calculator on the NCEES approved calculator list. If you want a programmable calc for that exam, this is your baby. If you want a good easy to use programmable calculator for your day to day use, I would go up a couple of notches and buy the 50g (I have both)."
3,Bring Back the HP 15c,"I recently purchased the HP33s as a replacement for my 20+ year old HP15c that I accidently dropped and damaged beyond repair. I first went to the HP website looking for another 15c only to find it had been discontinued, although HP had re-issued the Financial 12c(??) I wanted a caluclator with RPN and eventually came to the HP33s. While this calculator incorporates all of the needed functions etc... it is a very poor replacment for the 15c. It is to large, the display is difficult to view and key-pad not very ergonomic. The 15c was superior in each of these respects. I have since emailed the HP-CEO (Mr. Hurd)on line requesting that they bring back (re-iisue the 15c) as they did the financial 12c. [...]"
1,Hate using it,"The functions are OK but the ergonomics really suck on this one. No large [enter] key, crowded layout, fashionable (?) v-shaped keyboard, crowded text, cheezy keys, display, name it. Rounded shape like a 9.99$ calculator. I much prefer using my old 32SII and even older 41CV... HP has a large number on fans who all disagree with the direction it is going (did you read any review cheering the new minuscule [enter] the new-and-not-improved keys ?).Does HP own RPN ? Right now I am stuck because I can only work with RPN. I am really looking forward to a chinese company to start cloning HP42s and HP32SII's..."
3,"Bought for FE Exam, a little difficult to use",This review is geared more toward engineers taking the FE/PE exam just FYI.I found this calculator to be adequate for taking my FE exam however did feel it could have been better. I also purchased years later the TI-30X Pro which blows this calculator out of the water as it also meets NCEES calculator standards. This only has 2 lines of text (the TI has 4 I believe). Some functions I thought were a little difficult such as rectangular to polar notation. I found myself getting confused with the instructions and much trial and error to figure out different functions. The TI tends to be more intuative.I would say the only plus of this HP is that it can do reverse polish notation. And that only means something to those who use it.Not really recommended for the FE/PE exams. Get the TI!
2,Worked well for a couple months,"After a couple months the keypad would enter the numbers properly making it useless...I could probably fix it, but I only needed it for an exam"
1,HP Purist Hates This Design,"I was forced to buy this calculator a few years ago in order to take the PE exam and I hate it. I use it a couple of time a week and each time I want to smash it into a million pieces or light it on fire. I understand the design resulted from a student competition. Someone find the person who designed it, wherever they are working now, if they are working, and fire them. The fact that the buttons don't follow a horizontal line interferes with your brain's ability to identify a pattern and makes the keys appear as a wildly-arranged field of keys. The numeral keys are not clearly distinguished from all the others, and scanning horizontally for the desired key is made impossible. Please, please, people at HP, abandon this design. Favor instead a design that accounts for usability."
4,Gets the job done,"I bought the calculator to take the PE exam. I would agree with some of the criticisms of the machine (single letter variable names, difficult to edit, etc.), but I found it to be a very powerful little calculator that never let me down. I was able to program over 150 mechanical engineering formulas into it, and that saved a lot of time and likely saved me from errors on the exam. Bottom line is, it helped me pass. HP has always been the best when it comes to calculators."
4,Great calculator,"I was a long time user of the HP 48 series. I used that all through college. I'm a Civil Engineer by profession w/10 yrs experience. I mainly use the simple functions so this works great for me. The 4 buttons on the top of the calculator ""eng, solve, modes, display"" take up a big portion of the calculator. I'd prefer to have a larger screen. I really enjoyed larger screen of the HP 48 since it allowed me to see several lines that I'd already entered and swap lines when doing series of things, like closing a traverse. I know this one stores numbers and I can do all the functions of the HP 48 I just don't want to change how I was doing it before I liked seeing 3-4 lines at a time.I like that this calculator is smaller and can fit in my front pockets. My old hp48 would have to balance on top of all the books and papers I was carrying to a conference room. I just put the hp33 in a pocket while I walk."
2,devours batteries,I purchased one of these at Walmart for $20. It seemed to good to be true. Well it was to good to be true. Apparently HP sold Walmart a batch of defective units. Mine went through (very expensive) batteries at the rate of two per 6 months under very light usage. I already own an HP 11 and an HP 32S. They require new batteries about every 5 years. Walmart would not give me a refund.
5,Great calculator,"I am one that has used a TI-86 all through high school, college and into my professional career. I had to have a different calculator to take the PE exam so my company likes the HP 33s so they let me borrow one. After getting used to it for it takes a bit to get used to, I was hooked on it. I like that it is very powerful but very small calculator. Very big display and easy to see equation and you can choose RPN or Alg. Of the calculators I have used (TI-35, TI-86, TI-89, HP-48, HP-49, & Casio 15) this is my favorite. Use TI-89 or HP-49 if you are needing a graphing calc., but if you don't then this is great for an engineering student or engineer."
1,Bring back the 32S,"After my 32S died, I had no choice but to purchase a 33S. Wow, what a disappointment. The things that made HP's so good had evaporated. The error free keyboard feed back, the simple, easy to read screen, the general quality feel.....All gone.For me, I make errors with this calculator >25% of the time which I did not make with my 32S. This is because the parallelagram keys induce errors from lack of input (click with no input) and they keys are too congested. I have tossed this junker and decided to get my 32S repaired. The 33S has made for a great used market for 32S's. They're going for ~$150 or 3 times what they sold new."
2,HP missed on this one - wait for next or buy used,"If you do not need to know where the decimal point falls in your answer, then this calculator is for you. If you do need to know, you are going to be frustrated by the similarity of the tiny commas and periods that look almost the same (For example, it is easy to tell the difference between 3.141 and 3,141 here but NOT on the 33s.)Buy a used HP 32SII (a true 5 star calculator) on eBay or wait for the next version from HP.Everything else on the 33s works as advertised."
3,HP33S,"A very capable calculator. It's no HP-28S, but capable all the same. A few too many functions crammed into a small keypad makes it a chore to find the correct function. I suspect this will get easier with time. I think I'll go back to the HP-28S that I've had for 19 years once I am done with the PE exam."
3,THE SCREEN IS DARK,I am an enginner also so I cannot live without a calculator. I find this calculator very useful for the price but the screen is too dark even in its maximum level of brightness.
4,Good Calculator,I have owned many HP calculators. This 33S is just as good as all the rest. It will replace my old 42S which I have had for 11 years. I have loved every HP I have ever owned and this one is up to my expectations and is very good.
3,At least it has RPN,"I have one 42s left (having left one on an airplane), and a 32sII in reserve, but since I will need to use RPN for the rest of my life, I bought a 33s.It is too big, in the case, for your shirt pocket. Well, my 42s lives there anyway, but the 33s will fit without case in the shirt pocket. I am so slobby that while I wear a shirt and tie, I rarely wear a jacket. So, where do you stash the 33s?But, please, can't HP come out with the 42s again? I managed to buy the 42s at $100 in 1990 when my 15c died. At the time I was a grad student in engineering living on a meager stipend provided by GM.Now I make 20 times that amount. I might not pay $2000 for a good calculator, but I might.The calculator does look better in real life than in the pictures, so it is not embarrassing. The decimal is too small, but not the end of the world."
2,Small decimal point makes it unusable,"Before you buy an HP 33s, key in 22.22 and see if your eyes can spot the decimal point. It's about a half of a pixel! After making numerous mistakes because of this bad design, I ordered an HP 49G+ Graphics calculator with beautiful, clear characters. So if you have eyes like spiderman, you'll probably be happy with the 33s."
5,Better than the 32SII,I bought this calculator for less than got for my BROKEN HP 32SII on ebay! It is just like the 32SII with some new features and buttons. It also looks cool - although the 32SII looked cool too in a 1990 type of way. As far as I know it is the only RPN calculator you can buy (not counting those dorky graphing models).Using this calculator just makes you feel good.
4,A special device,"The calculator is without any question a powerful device, packed with functions and possibilities. But, and that is the main argument for or against buying it, it is not designed to be used in algebraic mode, which means you input the formula like it is written on paper. This calculator with its keyboard layout is a Reversed Polish Notation calculator. If you love to play with numbers or already now RPN this is the device to buy. If you just search for a calculator with many functions and easy input buy a Sharp 506 (V) model or anything newer. (For example there are no keys for ""("" and "")"", only as shift functions (because RPN doesn't use brackets)."
4,HP 33S Scientific calculator a success,"I needed a replacement for my 32SII and the 33S more than fit the bill. I have no trouble distinguishing the decimal as others complained and although the keys are slightly angled they are slightly larger and easy to get used to.The calculator has all the features of the 32SII plus additional memory, additional functions and a duel display. I use this calculator consistently for unit conversions and algebraic calculations and it's faster than the 32SII I used for the last 12 years"
3,This one needed a better editor.,"Dry Spell has one of the most interesting premises I have encountered in a while. A rainmaker who travels from town to town grifting and making rain. A town that suffers from an otherworldly dry spell. The marriage of the two should have been explosive. What happened? This novel ground to a halt about midway through and never recovered. Ms. Moloney's editor should have helped her streamline this tale. A good editor would have and should have made the plot line clearer, lessened the roles of more minor characters, and broadened the plot line of the ghost who is the major cause of the drought. I think this would make a wonderful movie, and I did enjoy the book -- problems and all."
3,The Shining with a love story set in a town well kind of...,This is not a THRILLER or really a HORROR story but part of the story is supernatural. I am saying this because it is not really suspenseful story. It really is a love story more than anything else. However some parts of it seem very Stephen Kingish especially towards the end. If you ever saw (in the movie version) or read THe Shining you will recognize at least one or two parts very similar. I can tell she is a Stephen King fan because of certain parts in the book where Stephen King and Jack Nicholson (this part might be tongue-in-cheek humor) are mentioned.I liked the characters and descriptions in this book. I especially like the paranoid character who thinks that everything's a conspiracy.A good and strange book worth a read.
5,Rain Rain,"This is my first Moloney read and I am impressed .The story starts out so relaxing in a fictional town of Goodlands North Dakota . A small town that most would say is a nice place to farm and raise a family but then Goodlands hasn't had any rain for 4 yrs and the farmers are concerned and then Tom (a drifter ) comes to town and his first stop is a bar where he meets these guys and makes a $50 wager with them that he can make it rain ............In away the author brings Tom to life in the novel and with his ways of trying to congure up the rain it is so relaxing like you are right there on that field next to him and feel the presence of the rain just beyond grasp , so real you can almost smell the rain and the fresh air .A very nice relaxing read and I give this author and the plot of the story 5* . I will read more by Moloney ."
3,Well crafted,"I did enjoy this book. I want to read other work by this author. I liked the ""rainmaker"" and Karen, and enjoyed the plunge into their pysches. However, I lost the thread of the love that developed, and the attraction was not clearly compelling between the lead characters. All secondary characters were extremely interesting and well developed. I would have desired a more focused conclusion."
4,Genre defying,"The small farming community of Goodlands has been plagued by a drought for four long years. Farmers are losing their farms and being forced off their land. If that wasn't bad enough strange occurances begin to happen. Some of these ""accidents"" defy explaination. Just when it seems the town is beyond all hope a man walks into town who can call the rains down from the heavens and save the dying community.Dry Spell is a romance, a horror story, a story of how people deal with the prospect of losing it all. I was impressed with this truly unique story. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I would have liked to have seen a little more closure at the end of the book. But definately worth reading all the same."
3,Good but....,"I enjoyed this book, but I can't say I found it very suspenseful or frightening. The author has a nice style and a good idea....it just needs to be refined."
2,"If You Really Want to Give It a Go, Do NOT Buy, Just Borrow!","Oh boy! I was expecting suspense from this book, but no, not enough of that to be classified under this category. Apart from the lack of proper dose of so call suspense, a few major drawbacks I found were that the story line was loose and flat. The authoress introduced too many characters in the story that it distracted readers and could lost their focus. If this book was a borrowed book, I would have stopped reading it after the first few chapters. However, since I paid every penny for it, I tried very hard, really very hard to finish it hoping something good and grasping would turn out eventually - telling myself that the money was not badly spent.Although the book was disappointing to me, I am giving it a 2-star because I think I have to be fair in giving the authoress credit of writing so many words, and her effort behind of creating so unneccesary distracting side stories.Sorry! I will not buy another book by Susie Moloney."
2,A Boring Read,"If you enjoy stories in which almost every character is either stupidly naive or kick-the-cat, rape-the-girl mean, where the action consists of drunken brawls and suspicious gossip, and where the setting is a close-minded, downtrodden small town, then this is the book for you. I found it depressing in the extreme. Comparisons to Steven King notwithstanding, I couldn't bring myself to care about any of these characters - they were all so one-dimensional. The descriptive paragraphs went on without end. This is the kind of book in which you can read the first sentence of a paragraph, skip down to the next, and you'll only miss more sordid details of wife or alcohol abuse, etc."
4,The Playboy of 2000/2005,"This dvd is basically the Playboy I grew up with. The world of the 7 girlfriends before there was a Girls Next Door, and Hef's main attraction of the 90s Pamela Anderson being featured in this video. Highlights of parties at the mansion and Hef interviewed with performances featured at the mansion."
3,Didn't have the person I was looking for...,"I was looking for a picture of Valerie Bertinelli. I remember some years back I had an anniversary issue with her in it, I swear she was. I thought this was the one, but she's not there. I've searched playboy and there's nothing. It's so frigging weird. I know I saw her sitting, hugging her knees, kitty purring ever so sweetly."
3,Buyer be aware...,"I recently purchased this iteam and was so dissapointed with what I received. The previous image had six different ink pad with a review that the teacher enjoyed putting a different scented stamp each day on her students. It only came with one. What a rip off! Oh well, what can you do. That's what happens when you shop online."
5,Best unknown surf album of the 60's,"This is Gary Usher's masterpiece. An album that defined surf music but was relatively unknown. The instrumentals are as powerful as any surf music written today. And kudo's to Capitol Records (i assume) for a marvelous remastering job. The sound is amazing. In short, if you love the surf sound (including the ""silly"" songs) you will love this album. So....download the album, take your iPod to the beach, grab a chair and listen on good headphones and I can promise you that you will be transported back in time when we all made the ""surfin' scene."""
1,"Only 4 songs, rest pure instrumental","Just to be nice I give this Super Stock re-issue of their 1964 LPSurf Route 101 one star for the title song which was a local hitand had all the ingredients of a good sounding ""Beach Boys"" stylehit. The rest of the 11 ""songs"" are completely forgettable. 8 tracksare pure instrumental and sound all the same and the other 3 areeither with Gary all by himself or with some bad vocal back-ups. Itis so important, when you buy a CD or DVD, to have the customer'sopinion even if you may think they are wrong because buying somethingjust like that may lead to a tremendous disappointment. I have given4 stars to most of the Sundazed reissues on Surf and Hot Rod music(Rip Chords, Fantastic Baggys, Bruce & Terry) but this one isn'tworth its purchase. You can find Gary Usher on other collection witha much better result than this CD."
3,Slip fit or not,"The part number, 15136-S-CP would indicate a slip fit spout. As a prior reviewer noted the advertisement of slip fit or NPT is not quite right as they are different part numbers. I wanted a slip fit so thought I was ok. Of course what arrived was a 15136-CP or NPT only. Fortunately, I could remove the slip assembly from my old spout and it screws into the NPT thread of the new one. However, I felt ripped off. I'm not sure Amazon knows what part they are selling or perhaps Kohler is not putting the slip assembly in the box with the NPT spout."
4,dictionary,"bought for my younger bro. and he likes it. it is bigger than i thought tho,. which is a good thing."
4,student's dictionary,Love it! Easy to use! My two kids use it all the time now. Great for Elementary and Junior High students.
5,Webster's New Word Student's Dictionary,"This dictionary will be appropriate for students in middle and high school. Even in the age of computers and Spell Check, dictionaries are indispensable. This one is a dandy."
4,student dictionary,This dictionary is just the ticket for an adult language learner who's ready to move from a beginning dictionary but needs to stay at this level for awhile before moving on to an adult dictionary. Good sized print with many colored pictures to keep a disabled learner's attention.river runner girl
3,It's Okay,My four year old got this for her birthday and never plays with it she said b/c it doesn't do anything. It just sits in her stroller.
5,Wonderful explanation of 3D,"There are dozens of manuals and ""how to"" books out there for 3D artists. However, there are very few that help the reader understand the fundamentals of how the software works and why the workflow is set up the way it is. The Art of Maya explains the process of working in 3D better than anything out there. I've been a professional animator and 3D artist for over ten years and this book blew me away. The illustrations are terrific, the text is very clear, and the illustrations are amazing. Nope, it's not a manual. You won't learn which button to click while holding down the alt key, but you will come away with a better understanding of the software and the field. A great book, buy it!"
2,Still not impressed,"This was the first Maya book I purchased. Being that the book claims to be for ""beginners"" I quickly became dissappointed. I didn't even bother finishing the book at the time because I wanted to LEARN Maya, not hear about what it is capable of. I bought another book and finally got over the learning curve. I then decided to go back and read this book again. Although there are some very general concepts revealed in this book, I still came away feeling like the time was wasted."
1,Just a catalogue,I'm an Animator and an Animation/VFX teacher and I find this book like an illustrated catalogue (printed on high quality paper) of what can you do with Maya. It goes through the production proccess of animation in a VERY general way. Recommended just for newbies and summer courses.
1,Useless Book,"I already knew that the book was little more than a brochure for Maya, but I bought it because it claimed to have the Personal Learning Edition on CD, rather having to go through the long download time to get it. Waste of time, since the CD does nothing more than set up the download, then try to connect to the Alias/Wavefront website to obtain the data. I have a different book, the Maya Bible, that gives me all the learning resources I'll need for awhile, but I still can't start since the disk doesn't have what it says it has. Don't bother with this book."
1,a useless book except the CD-ROM Maya PE5,"this book is useless. after finish the whole book, you will know nothing about CG or Maya. The book comes with Maya Personal Edition software which is useful, but soon will be available free from maya website."
1,Boring,"You have seen one paint, you've seen all. Everytime he draws the same scenes. The techniques are well presented, but you needn't buy a video for this. Watch BR alpha, a German TV programme at night (CET). It's much cheaper. :-)"
4,Would have liked to attend this school!,"I purchased this CD because I love California Sound/Hot Rod music. I read on a review sight that this was one of the Super Stocks better albums. I also wanted to hear more of Chuck Girards (Hondells Little Honda vocalist, founding member of legendary Christian Rock Group Love Song) vocals. It is a pretty good album although not as good as I had hoped. I liked Chucks song, ""Wild One"" quite a bit, others are good too. Its worth checking out though as their last album, they were getting the sound down by now, but this music was beginning to fall out of favor. By 1964 the British invasion was taking hold, and kind of shutdown and stopped the Surf/Hot Rod music craze. I am glad I purchased it though."
5,Crests tracks after Johnny Maestro period again available,This CD has got tracks recorded as by The Crests after Johnny Maestro's period as lead singer. Guilty does have the rare judge talk introduction that is impossible to get on 45 so this CD is worth buying only because of those few seconds.This CD is also worth of buying because of the Flamingos tracks + some songs have probably never been issued on CD before. Great DooWop!
5,Excelente,"muy buen libro, es una excelente gramatica...practica y rapida de consultar. adicionalmente, el servicio de venta fue muy rapido y facil. el seguimiento es muy bueno Llego a tiempo."
3,Eggers can do better,"Personally, I feel that Dave Eggers is a brilliant writer. Eggers' self-absorbed rants are beautifully written and hysterically observant. Some people have zero tolerance for the self-obsessed, and that's fine. Go find another author. Go read Hemingway or something if you like shallow characters.Anyways, I'm off subject. Daves Eggers' latest book, ""How We are Hungry,"" is, by far, his weakest. I was ecstatic to see this talented author show off his talent for short stories, assuming that it would be ""staggering."" I was wrong. A few of the stories are indeed brilliant, ""your mother and I,"" ""climbing to the window, pretending to dance,"" ""quiet,"" and the brief ""about a man who began flying after meeting her,"" are all classic Eggers. But much of it is just mediocre.Sadly, I found much of this book to be forgettable. If you are already an Eggers fan, than of course you should read it. But if you're looking for a place to start, AHWOSG or YSKOV are far superior."
2,Way to thick,"This cable is way to thick for standard use with my ipod / music player. It may be good for connecting AV units, but something that is tethered to my ipod seems to put alot of stress on the port. Also seems to look slightly different then picture."
3,"Entertaining, but disappointing","I had great expectations for this book. The premise is fantastic; in the new TV, a young girl sees the future while watching the world crumble around her. However, I didn't feel TV played as much of a part as I would have hoped. Lorena was jazzed by the movies just as much as viewing her new television. And, while the family ate TV dinners in front of the new set, other than that there were not a lot of changes to the family due directly to the new addition. I would have loved for Ms. Klein to explore ""test pattern TV"" and what affect it had on Cassie in greater detail. Instead, it was more of a quick look at odd, seemingly unrelated incidents that would be broadcast in the future. The potential was there, and I enjoyed the characters. I just wish she had dug a little deeper."
3,Potential for a good science fiction story...,"This book kind of reminds you of an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"", but the images seen in the television play second fiddle to what happens relationship-wise between the characters. The story sort of tunes out of this interesting concept of forseeing the future and into an (almost) soap opera...and stays there. It's as if Rod Serling is there, setting the stage, and then the Twilight Zone music is overpowered by the tinkling background music heard on any given soap opera.If you like a good fiction story about family relationships with a little dab of sci-fi thrown in, then you'd probably like this book. If you prefer sci-fi, you can read about the visions Cassie has and skim the rest."
3,Off-beat and easy to read,"Anyone see the movie Pleasantville? This book reminded me of it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a light, entertaining book with sympathetic characters."
5,amazing,"on of there best live performances i have ever seen, and now that the original line-up is back together there shows will be even more amazing"
4,Review of Maiden England,"I do really like this video, it has a great feel of 1988 and most of the songs are superb. My only complaint is the bass throughout, it sounds really clangy and you even hear Bruce complaining about it (I think he asks the engineer to turn it down a bit). Maybe that's how they liked the bass back in the day, or maybe if you play this video through a good quality sound system it wont sound so naff (I have a crappy TV set) but anyway it's not the end of the world, and apart from this, the video rocks. Recommended."
4,Review From Aussie Fan,"I only had to hear the CD I only had to hear this CD once to find out that it was very good. I got their new album before this one and I was not expecting it to be as good but it was, if not better. The other reviews I have read praised a few songs but didn't mention what I found, all the songs are good! Anyone who has heard s couple of Ammonia songs and liked them will enjoy this CD!"
3,Good for making things for your home . . .,"this book includes some very pretty doilies (I tatted Whip Cream Frill in white and it was beautiful) along with other doily-like patterns that are meant for use around the house. It's obvious from some of the designs that they're from another time period (1920s-1940s); there's not much call for 'luncheon sets' or chair antimacassars anymore, but those older patterns can be adapted into placemats or doilies. No visual patterns, and all the designs are written in short form, but none of the patterns are incredibly difficult. The edging patterns are nice but nothing out of the ordinary."
4,"Great deal, nice patterns","This book has a wide variety of patterns which are not simply ""reruns"" of the same old designs. It is well worth to buy, but not spectacular."
4,Tatting Doilies & Edgings,This was a good book about tatting. Good directions and easy to understand. My first tatting book and would recommend it to others.
2,Just OK,Not impressed with the patterns in this book. Waste of my money! Should have returned this item when I could have.
3,How to plant a naturalistic mediterranean hillside garden,"This book is written by Brits, so the perspective is a ""how to"" from a relatively cold climate, and the advice is a bit skewed. If you live in a mediterranean climate and are new to gardening, I don't think this would be the best advice book (check a regional book). The mediterranean gardens used for inspiration are the wild, hilly areas of France, Spain and Italy--not the quaint domesticated gardens in homes and villas along the sea. On the plus side, there is good information on how to prepare the soil for planting a mediterranean garden, which plants will likely succeed, and how to get the look they've described. I enjoyed the details about how specific plants survive in a drought-tolerant climate. There are ""weekend project"" ideas (i.e., creating mosaic pots and tables) that may or may not appeal to the reader. This is the kind of book I'd rather get from the library, than purchase, as the information I found helpful was minimal."
2,Going to the BVI? Forget this book!,"If you plan on visiting the British Virgin Islands forget Frommer's. The book has chapters on all US Virgin Islands. And a chapter with the BVIs all together and very brief. The competition - Fodor's and Lonely Planet - have separate chapters on at least the most popular BVIs (like Virgin Gorda) and only the smaller islands in a brief chapter all together. So generally speaking for the same price you can get a guide the whole US and British Virgin Islands (LP, Fodor's) or this book which generally is a US Virgin Islands guide with excursions to the BVIs..."
2,"Helpful Overview, Not Detailed Enough to Be Useful","I would not recommend this guide. I bought this book to help plan a vacation to St. John, since I could only find one book specifically about St. John. This book was far too general to be helpful. It provides an overview of all of the U.S. Virgin Islands and gives a few hotel, activity and restaurant recommendations on each island. If you know which island you are going to, this information will be far too broad to help you really plan activities. I found better advice on Trip Advisor to be honest. However, for those familiar with Frommer's guides, it is in the typical Frommer's format, which I find easy to search and navigate compared to other travel guide formats.For an excellent reference on St. John, I recommendSt. John Off The Beaten Track."
5,Frommer's Virgin Islands (Frommer's Complete),This book provided valuable information in preparation for my first-time cruise to the Virgin Islands. I would highly recommend this guide to anyone traveling to the Eastern Caribbean.
2,Very disappointing...,"I thought I was pretty good at picking them but man, was I off this time. It's hard to tell when you've never been to the location before but after a week on St. Thomas and St. John, I wish I would've read all these others reviews before I bought this book. I was very disappointed. There were SO MANY unacceptable errors in this book. Maps were wrong...there's an error on the St. John map that shows a road when actually it's only a walking trail. There were typos that got us lost in the city. The reviews weren't accurate at all. Places where it read ""live carribean music nightly"" were false. The restaurants never had a live band!Please consider purchasing another publication unless you don't mind wasting your money."
1,Completely Wrong,"We just returned from a trip to St. Thomas. We stayed at Saphire Beach Resort based on the ratings in Frommers - ""One of the best resorts on the island"" and ""one of the best restaurants"". Saphire Beach resort is one of the worst resorts we have every been to. Service is very poor - sometimes rude. Staff could not provide much insight into activities at the resort itself - let alone the rest of the islands. The food at the restaurant is awful - we actually got sick - we think from eating spoiled food there.Several great resaurants that we found later were not even listed in Frommers (Whale of a Tale in Red Hook, and Blue Moon Cafe at Secret Harbor).Don't buy this book, and don't go anywhere near Saphire Beach Resort."
2,Not worth the shipping charges,"This book is a definite non buy. We relied on it and had major issues. Some of the information was flat out wrong. As mentioned by one of the reviewers, the book implies it is easy to get around St Thomas on the bus when in reality, taxis are really the only way. We saw 4 buses in 6 days! The cabs run 8 to 12 dollars per run. Assuming you go to a different beach every day and out to dinner, you are looking at $40 a day to get around (we ended up getting a car).Also, the maps are poor. We ended up relying on a free map handed out by one of the hotels to drive around.The beach descriptions are off also. Some were no more than sandy patches.You're better off saving the $12 for your first cab ride!"
1,uncommonly poor for Frommers,"I bought this book for a recent trip to the British Virgin Islands, having used Frommer's guides on several vacations in the past.Most of the reviewers highlight problems in the sections on the USVI, but the sections on the BVI are worse. For example, there are none of the useful maps showing where hotels and restaurants are on the island, which makes planning day trips or dinner trips difficult. Also, it gives no hint that cabs are really the only way around, extremely expensive and highly unreliable.I think for my next trip to the Caribbean, I will just rely on their overall Carribean book (I've used the US and Europe ones and like them) and don't see the added value of the country/island/area specific book (most of the guides are recycled content anyway)."
2,Frequent traveler,"I love reading travel guides and this one was a tough read. I have purchased Frommer's guides in the past, which I usually appreciate for their thoroughness. It felt that this was more bogged down with historical facts rather than the best ;place to find roadside tacos. Mind you, I am a historian and not opposed to learning about history. In travel guides, I am looking for something to make it easy to navigate and lay out my itinerary for the week. They divided it by islands, but didn't really explain the best way to divide up your time. I imagine most people who travel to the Virgin Islands expect to island hop. The approach was a little schizophrenic, rather than linear (which I personally prefer when I travel). This particular trip is for my honeymoon and I will probably order a different guide."
4,Predictable but Fun,"Briefly, Nadia Knows Best is the story of a late 20's professional gardener who is engaged to the perfect man. This is a predictable enough story line that we know that he's going to dump her, going to want her back, and she's going to be tempted by an equally perfect guy she meets while getting over Stud #1. This story works because it is predictable and because the characters are so charming. Nadia is likeable. Her family is also predictably eccentric. No surprises here, just a relaxing read. And some days that's just what I'm looking for."
3,This would have made a great soap opera....,"I was really enjoying this book until near the end when things to get a little far fetched. At that point, the book seemed to take on a ""let`s throw everything but the kitchen sink in here"" kind of feel.... at that point, it lost me."
2,What does Nadia Know?,"This book was a disappointment. Not sure what Nadia knows best. Her family are more interesting than she is, but then even they are dull. Nadia's sister is nasty and bitchy but then she is in a relationship with a womaniser that is clearly using her which is apparent to everyone but her! The mother is a cow of a woman and is claerly not mother of the year material. Nadia's boss and love interest, is boring. This is a really light read and midly enjoyable."
1,When Tempers Flare,"Important information is provided on the background of anger. However, there is incomplete coverage of actual treatment of anger symptoms."
1,Another waste of time,"Even though I found his Glock book abysmal I bought this one at a gun show since I am a big 1911 fan. As usual Boatman talks tough but you can tell he's one of those ""tough guys' who has never actually done anything in real life just wishes he had. Just another nut case redneck wanna-be. Having said that this was a little better than his Glock book but not much. He did tone down the crazy political rhetoric a little. He favors the Stainless Colt Gold cup which he shoots with a cigar in his mouth. What a bozo. The Gold cup is OK for target shooting but he known weaknesses in construction and in the sights which he doesn't mention because I'm sure he doesn't know. Just another waste of paper. Lets hear some real experience Boatman. Something other than being a ""bodyguard"" for a Republican Senator (Chenowith) who turned out to be an adulterer and liar."
2,Sony Cable,"It does not work very well on my DVD player, and there were some significant damages on it"
5,very nice cable for the price!,got this really fast and got it in time for what i had to use it for and love it works really well and the picture is great thanks and would recommend this item !!!
5,Sony VMC20FR AV Cable,Sony VMC20FR AV Cable works perfect with my camcorder I would recommend others to give it a try they would not be disappointed
4,not bad...,"i bought this item because i needed to connect my wd tv live to a regular tv that doesn't have a hdmi connection, when i tried it the first time it didn't work. there was no signal on my tv, so you don't have plug the cable in the same order of the colors. it goes like this:3 RCA / tvwhite / yellowred / redyellow / white"
5,Helpful,"The product bought from this company was fine, but did not work for what i needed. The company was very responsive in trying to help me but in the end i returned their product and a credit was given. Great to work with."
1,av cable ng,this product does not work. someone should have checked this chinese product before sending it out.its going back.please don't send a replacement.chriszeee
3,It does its job,Every page has the right number of objects (you know the drill - from one bear up to ten hats) with cute photographs.Just what you expect.
4,Perhaps their best album as a duo,This may have been their best album as a duo (after Dan Peek left). They strike the right balance between their own material and that of outside writers. This was their comeback album in 1982 and produced one big hit (You Can Do Magic) and one minor hit (Right Before Your Eyes). The only song on it that I did not care for was Even The Score. The rest of the material is very good.
4,Excellent!,I really enjoyed this album when it came out. It was the big comeback album in 1982. Very nice!
5,America's Hits,"Well, this is another hits from America after History Greatest Hits I suppose. ""You Can Do Magic"" & ""Inspector Mills"" have made their way to the chart when this album was released. The songs were neatly done. Hear the late Jeff Porcaro's drumming in this entire album.If you love America, buy this CD."
5,Let your senses guide you!,"It's really a shame that LP's like that didn't make it all the way to the top. It's full of lovable tunes you love to listen on the radio (You can do magic, Inspector Mills) or fall in love with (You girl, Sometimes lovers).You see in the end it doesn't really matter if AMERICA provided as with THE NEW SOUND OF THE 80'S or not.It's just a matter of having THE RIGHT FEELING.And believe you me this LP/CD has all it takes to win your heart.Listen without prejudice."
4,We love GB!,"just had to respond to the first reviewer's outrageous comment: ""maudlin piano ballads from Beckley"". Gerry Beckley carries America with his ballads and arrangements. Bunnell's creative kaledioscope lyrics can only go so far."
1,"Not in weekly or monthly view, diffucult to use.",This planner could hardly be used as a planner. Needed to be in a month-at-a-glance format instead of four or five dates per page.
5,Orecchiette,"De Cecco pasta is always the best. These orecchiette are the only ones I use to prepare with rapini. These De Cecco orecchiette keep well the cooking, don't become mushy or sticky as other brands."
1,DO NOT PAY FOR THIS ITEM,"Rating is for the thought of paying for this, the DVD itself is okay.This is a free DVD you can get directly from Princess on their web site. Anybody selling something like this, especially a version that is now 2 years out of date, is just trying to rip you off."
5,Wonderful debut!,"Seven of the ten songs on this album have been radio hits. Very unusual for a debut album, but definately deserved. Every song is so good that this could almost be a greatest hits album, albeit her only album until last year. And judging by the success of 'Tuesdays Child', when the time does come for a 'Greatest Hits' album, I think it will have to be a double. She has an amazingly strong and powerful voice, well suited to rock, but equally at home with ballads. It seems she appeals to a wide range as I have also heard her on country radio as well as seen her videos on CMT. Although she is definately more rock than country. Thanks Jeff Healey for helping to discover her, and for giving her a chance."
5,Beautiful,"I got Amanda's second album before this one, and was extremely impressed. So naturaly I had to get her first one too. I'm glad I found this wonderful talent. Every song is great. You must get this."
3,an 'in the bag' album,"amanda marshall is put down for not having written very much on her debut album, but her voice makes up for that in some way. The album features some good and solid songs but she misses some traits that would bring her stardom. People have said that anybody could sing these songs, maybe so it doesn't matter anyway. Time will give her the skills that are needed to get that far, if not well if it's good enough for me... I can recommend it to anyone that likes sitting in the garden on a sunny afternoon. Because that's where I will be listening this music."
2,Comes out swinging,"Some artists slowly insinuate themselves into your psyche, requiring repeated listenings while their songs to percolate around in your brain. Not so Amanda Marshall. Her songs and her vocals, abetted by big label production, come out swingin' for the fence. Her voice has the flexibility to go from soulful shouting to soulful warbling. Her lyrics are just as forthright. For my taste, it's all a bit too strident, too 'out front'. I prefer the artists that hold something back, that don't tell you everything, the ones that leave some mystery that compels you to play the songs again. Marshall has more immediate appeal, but one that wears thin sooner."
3,could be better........,"Tuesday's child is an amazing album, and is better than this album. The songs are rather similar and seem to mesh together. While Tuesday's Child is listened to with great ease, I have to push my self to finish this album. I feel that it has some good songs (Let it Rain, Last exit to Eden) but everything else is slow and similar. This CD had tons of Number ones, but didn't hit the right chord with me. Buy Tuesday's Child."
2,Straight from the factory....,"This just sounds like more cookie-cutter '90s schlock. Nothing original, nothing new, nothing exciting. These songs could have been written by anybody and performed by any group of studio musicians. Amanda has a serviceable voice with a good range, but then so does Mariah Carey, and her stuff is straight from the cookie-cutter also.It's all about looks, image, style, and making lots of money, rather than musical originality and creativity. This is sad."
4,The debutalbum,"The canadien singer has an awesome voice. That's for sure. Her style is soft rock with a little bit of pop and a little bit of country.Let it rain: One of her best songs ever. A great rockballad.Birmingham: This song is long but it doesn't really have a highlight. So it's kinda boring.Fall from grace: When I say pop I mean this one.Dark horse: A nice ballad. I love it.Beautiful goodbye: This one is probably my favourit song along with ""LIR"". It starts out very quietly but then it turns out to be a big ballad.Sittin on top of the world: This is the only fast song here It's rock. Check out Leann Rimes' version.Last exit to Eden: This sounds like a country song. I don't like it that much.Let'S get lost: I also don't like this one very much.Trust me (This is love): Reminds me of ""DH"". Nice ballad.Promises: Another ballad but it's not so good."
3,SLICK CHICK TUNES...,"... with the obvious standout being ""Sittin' On Top Of The World"", an instant soft rock classic with a great toe-tappin' groove to it. The rest is ballad-heavy chick music. Add an extra half-star for being a fellow Canadian."
5,Powerful and haunting - keep the player on repeat!,"I first heard Amanda Marshall watching an ice skating competition, but didn't know it was her. Roslyn Summners skated to Beautiful Goodbye and I couldn't get the melody out of my head. Several weeks later, she sang the national Anthem at an Orlando Magic game, and I recognized the distinct voice and was hooked. I bought her debut album and kept it on repeat all! Her vocal range and power is really amazing. She covers the gammet of emotions. Buy it and you'll be hooked."
5,Canada's best pop/rock export,"I saw her Birmingham video on VH1 way back when and when I found the tape at a local store, only $4.99, brand new, I grabbed it up. I've been playing that baby for 12 yrs so I decided to upgrade to the CD. There is some real depth here, not just in the songs but overall. Her voice is wonderful."
4,Fun Sci Fi movie,"Interesting giant robot film that has some good SPFX,and an unique storyline.It can get boring at a few times,but still,it's a good film."
2,Stephen King actually wrote this....,"or so it may seem by the brutality in this book. Tabitha is more of a ""literary"" writer than her famous husband, so after two ot three novels that didn't sell very well, she wrote this and even though I read it yeara ago when it came out, I still remember it was something about a mother and her sons trapped in cabin or something. And some people break in and torture the family.Not at ALL like her previous books or those that followed. And not very good, either.I think the best book she wrote was CARETAKES."
5,Wonderful Illustrations,"This book has wondeful illustrations which compliment it's informational content. I enjoyed learning about all the different bridges, when they were built and who they were built by. I read it to a Kindergarten class and they loved the pictures and all the different kinds of bridges. I learned a lot by reading it so I know children will too."
5,"Like Traveling With a Fun, Smart Friend","As a fairly frequent traveler to Ireland, I appreciate a lively, well-researched guide with a real ""feel"" (and love) for the country, and this is it! I love the style. The writing is breezy and fresh, chock-full of sharp observations and savvy tips. We're already using the guide to plan our next trip."
5,Excellent / easy reading book!,"I have really enjoyed this book so far - we have not made our trip to Ireland yet so I can't compare it with my travel plans yet. This book had great down to earth tips in it - What not to say, why you don't say it - make time for ...... Told you those ""little"" things that a friend that lived in Ireland might mention to you, but someone traveling would never know! I recommend the purchase"
4,"practical, good advice!",Have not actually verified the information contained in it.. But will let you know more after my month long trip to Ireland is over!
4,Girt for Mom,This was a gift for my mother. She has used may of the Dummies books and loves it! My mom is planning her trip to Ireland and wanted this book to help with her itinerary!
1,Not recommended,This book is so full of errors that they are too many to list here. It really is a very bad source on Ireland that anyone who has any knowledge on Ireland would spot how bad it is. This is unfortunatley the type of book that gets publicity but is actually quite uninformed. If you want genuine information on Ireland and Irish culture I recommend that you go elsewhere.
5,I loved this book!,"Ever want to see Sherlock Holmes fall flat on his face? Or the longest baseball game in history? You can have all this in Greasy Lake. From the ridiculous to the sublime, from the ""Beggar Master of Sivani-Hoota"" to ""The Hector Quesadilla Story"", Boyle ranges through writing styles and emotion like a master. This is a book with a new twist around every bend, and Boyle's beautiful stories will leave you both rolling with laughter and a little disturbed at times, but always entertained"
4,Greasy Lake and Other Stories,"A fun filled romp though the late 50's and early 60's. Good variety of stories, well written, including the nitty gritty of the times. Easy reading for kicking back and relaxing."
4,Greasy Lake,"In reading ""Greasy Lake"" what are we really experiencing? T.C. Boyle presents his observations of love and loss with the unclouded eye of a reporter. He captures these moments in time with exceptional prose. His lyrical use of language, the skill with which he presents the tale is fabulous, but in the end I felt that I had missed something. When I put the book down it was if I had had a delicious gourmet meal but still felt hungry. For when I closed the book, I forgot about the characters. I didn't think about what had happened to them - I didn't wonder, I didn't care. Despite that is ""Greasy Lake"" worth reading? Definately. TC Boyle's richness of description is worth every lucious moment."
1,Warner Brothers Cuts Corners on Audio Again,"I have been ripped off by Warner Brothers before, and refuse to be suckered again! Look at the back image of this HD product""2.0 audio"". That means 2 channels-LEFT and RIGHT!! No Surround. That is not HD to me. I've been a fan since 1986, and I'm very dissappointed!"
4,Finally the Kings have been Crowned with the Stanley Cup!,"I've been waiting for DECADES for this team to win the Stanley Cup. They worked hard and persevered. Great documentary on their way to earn the NHLs most coveted award, the Stanley Cup."
5,Does this DVD include Bob Miller announcing?,"I'm excited like everyone else about this Kings DVD, however no one has mentioned if Bob Miller and Jim Fox are included in this DVD. Does anyone know if they are? Let me know as I'll wait for their DVD if it's separate. Thanks"
5,GO KINGS,Been a fan of the Kings since Gretzky...So proud of the Kings and cant wait til this comes out ....
5,Great Package!!!,"If you're a Kings fan I'd imagine you're going to buy this item after waiting a long time to see them win the Stanleyy Cup...But the blu-ray package should be your choice, for no other reason than the bonus material...But first the overall presentation is great, with the biggest emphasis being on the Kings playoff run including every game along their run..The picture quality is great and sound is awesome, you get a few tidbits from behind the scenes of what goes on during the Kings season...But like I said the best part is the bonus material, with extra footage of the locker room celebration,the on ice Cup celebration, and the Victory parade, plus the 5 minute PP that practically buried the NJ Devils in the clinching game...In my opinion these extras make this blu-ray worth the price and should be the standard for other Sports Championship Videos..."
3,Great to see the Kings win the cup but a so so blu ray,"I really liked being able to relive parts of all their playoff games. But, it really lacked detail for the games, only showing goals, saves and some hits. Nevertheless, I could live with all of this if it wasn't for Matthew Perry popping his mug up to tell us all about hockey. Why the heck is he in this video?"
3,Wanted more,I was hoping to get more game action. I really want to have all the games throughout the Kings playoffs run...
3,"I'm not sure why this item was characterized as a toy, but . . .","The copic sketch marker I got to use for making Chinese characters (I'm taking a class in Chinese right now), and it works very well for that use. I used it to make some handmade flash cards, and writing with it helped me to remember the characters better."
5,"It is for every girl, woman and lady",What a fantastic book! I have been trying to find a book for myself that summarizes Proverbs 31...I got so much more! It doesn't just explain Proverbs 31 well but the poem makes it practical AND the added benefit that I can share this knowledge with my daughter from an early age when she is still a little sponge learning about God's perfect will for her...PRICELESS! I am buying it for all my friends with little girls as a belated Mother's Day gift. I hope this will be a blessing for you as it is for me!
2,"Very, very fluffy","I was really unimpressed with this book. The illustrations are beautiful, but the poems don't really make a lot of sense (e.g. they don't explain what being helpful, cheerful or confident really mean). The poems are also short - just four lines. It reminds me of a book a grandma would give her granddaughter, that would subsequently sit on a shelf collecting dust. It lacks substance and re-readability.I would have liked to see the poetry abandoned for more substance. I bought it hoping to use it to teach our 4 year old character qualities but this is definitely not a good resource for that. Instead I would recommend Crossroads of Character: Learning to make wise choices."
2,My 4 year old didn't understand a word of this...,"It's clear that an old woman wrote it, and only old women would enjoy reading it. OR old fashioned...""God's Little Girl is Hearty... Buckle your shoe, do you know this rhyme? Ready, Set, Go, it works every time. To give it your all in school, home and play. I need your strength dear lord, we pray.What does that even mean??? The sentence structure is haphazard, there's no rhythm. I could tell my 4 year old went into lala land from cover to cover."
5,God's Wisdom for Little Girls,This is a wonderful gift idea. Parents appreciate the virtues that will be read about for years to come. I like how the book can become very personal when a picture of the child is placed in the picture frame at the end of the book. Very clever that the little girl has no face in the book illustrations.
4,Good product,This works really good. The hard part is to remember to turn the microphone on/off. Good purchase.
1,It almost does the job....,Okay.... I left it on. The next time I went to use it... dead battery. Would an indicator light take THAT much power to let the user know the thing is on and working?The cap DOES come off very easily. I'm always looking for it. I think the guy who used the silver duct tape has a good idea.The mic pics up the camera motor sound. Fortunately I can edit that out for the most part.I have a DCR-HC1000. The camera has a smart shoe... why doesn't Sony make a mic (other than the shotgun mic which I do own) that takes advantage of that shoe?I'm looking for another mic and will probably throw this in a drawer.
4,"Yes, it does work with the hot shoe on camcorder","Some reviewers below have said that this microphone doesn't work with the Sony hot shoe. Wrong. Click on the ""Technical Details"" on this page and you'll see the Sony Camcorder models that this microphone works with.Failure to look at which camcorders are compatable with this microphone is the fault of the customer, not any fault with the microphone! So don't give it a low rating based on your own lack of research when buying a product, please."
2,"Good sound, but poorly designed","I have to agree with Scipio's review. I have stopped using this mic for a few reasons. 1) I forgot to turn it on one time and lost a lot of valuable sound on my footage. 2) I never know if it is working or not as it doesn't integrate with the camera, so how do I know when the batteries are dead?? Scares me to use it not knowing if its working or not. Sound quality was great for the few times I have used it, but I'll be looking for a hot shoe mic now."
1,ECMMSD1 doubles mechanical noise,"Bought this item and returned it the next day. I was hoping to reduce or eliminate the mechanical noise picked up on my Sony DCR-TRV 103 by using this microphone. Well, even in the 90 degree setting, the mechanical noise that my camcorder emits is still picked up. In fact it sounded as though I was hearing two sets of mechanical noise instead of one. This mic should cut out the on board mic (a stereo version already), but apparently did not. Went into my settings and tried channel 1 only, then channel 2 only, then 1 and 2. Did not make a difference. Only good thing I can say is it fit in the Sony shoe. Of course it is not made to work with the intelligent shoe and is powered by battery and plugs into the mic-in jack. Don't bother with this model."
3,Compatibility incorrect on Sony website,"Bought this thinking it would work with the HDR-HC1 - it does not. The shoe is not the right shoe for the HC1 camera. It is listed as a compatible accessory on the Sony web site, but when we got it and AFTER opening the package realized it was wrong, were quite disappointed. Bought it from ANT Online and because the packaging was opened, couldn't return it. You can't open electronics packaging without damaging it, making almost anything unreturnable. So now I have to figure out how to get rid of it. Contact me if you want it for Amazon pricing plus shipping."
2,Didn't have significant improvement,"I thought the mic will have significant improvement on sound clarity and quality, but obviously not. Also, it is not very easy to use that it is not easy to clip on and be stable, and needing to use on/off buttons to turn the mic on is really not a good feature (it should be just automatic). I taped a birthday scene for my daughter but later found out that I didn't have the birthday sound because I didn't turn on the mic, what a bummer!"
5,Alibi for those early 80s,"This album helped me enjoy long days of study during those early '80s, when I started Engineering studies in Neuquen city, Patagonia Argentina. No doubt Alibi did hit my soul with America's own style."
3,"gerry great, dewey less so","This album is pretty unmemorable. Gerry is excellent as always with the fairly well known and melodic 'survival'. He handles 'don't believe in miracles' nicely. The best are his two songs near the end of the album. 'Coastline' sounds like it is influenced by the beach boys, and is beautiful. My fave song is the gorgeous melodic 'one in a million'. Lovely ballad.The other covers are just plain boring and I usually skip them.Dewey's songs tend to rock more here than any other album. 'Might be your love' has a nice verse, but the chorus is repetitive.'Hangover' is rubbish and tries to rock but is just plain embarrassing. And 'valentine' is just unmelodic and just not America's style.'Silent Letter' was way way better. This is among America's weaker efforts."
3,"Pretty good, but remakes","This is all in all a pretty good cd, but let me tell you right now, these are not the original recordings you heard on radio in the 1970's. These are re recording that the late Roger Miller must have made later on in life. While they are still good performances, they lack the ""zip"" that the original recordings had. Don't get ""slickered"" into this like I did. Even though it was done on a major label, it's not the real thing. Only buy Miller on Polygram or RCA.Anything else is re recorded stuff."
5,New moms need this book!,"""The Wall Between Women"" is a great read for new moms who may not have faced the wall, yet, but will because author Beth Brykman leaves no doubt that it is still as strong as it ever was! Brykman's articulate, coast-to-coast research gives all women validation of their own experience as full-time career, working part-time, or full-time at-home moms. As women, we learn so much from one another, particularly when it comes to the critical choices affecting our children and our professions. This book's tell-it-like-it-is narratives will clue a new mom into other women's experiences, gaining valuable insight into making her own working/mothering choices. Actually, all women could learn a lot from this book in terms of being be more understanding and supportive of friends and colleagues whose choices differ from their own."
5,Excellent text,"This book is a great guide to PL/SQL, especially for DBA's and non-programmers. The reference section is especially good, and I can quickly find PL/SQL snippets to assist me."
4,good but overpriced,"This DVD is good because it introduce you to watercolors in the most basic form possible. However, it is kind of brief on each subject,still informative,and shows you right away how they journal. Even though I already knew some of the techniques I was able to learn a few things that are useful. What I did not like much was that the artists kept talking between themselves looking at each other most of the time; that kind of made me feel like I was eavesdropping on them. Though the information is valuable, I think that it is overpriced, I was expecting way more from this DVD due to it's length. However, I still recommend it to anyone new to watercolors and/or journalinng; you'll find it very informative and inspirational."
5,Sounds like the Statesmen would sound today,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this CD since I purchased it, this is definately the best Cd in my collection. I have been a fan of George Younce for a long time and him singing with Jack and the rest of the quartet has brought back a sound that I havent heard since the original Statesmen Quartet. Fantastic CD, can hardly wait for the next one."
4,Better than OEM,"I am using these bulbs in our 2003 Honda Odyssey. While they do NOT last as long as OEM, I have found that the light they put out is much more suitable for night-time driving. They are MUCH better than the ""Sylvania SilverStar"" bulbs, which will only last around 6 months. I've consistently gotten at least a year or so from the bulbs, and find that the more-frequent replacement is worth the improved lighting.That said, save yourself a few bucks and buy the 2-pack. It's only like $5 more, which makes the replacement much more economical.I'm giving it 4-stars, mainly because I like the light these put out. The price is OK, and they could last longer, which knocks them down a bit."
1,Life-span of Xtravision is VERY short,"I replaced the headlights on my Honda Odyssey with Sylvania Xtravision bulbs. In less than 6 months, both bulbs have died. I now have replaced them with standard headlight lamps instead of the Xtravision headlight. There should a warranty on these bulbs... Don't waste your money and time on this product. The ""extra brightness"" isn't worth the aggravation."
3,Bright but won't create any miracles,"I was hoping for more light but what I got was a slightly brighter light. By slightly, I mean it was more white and maybe 15% brighter than my OEM dingy yellow lights.But if you really want to see the road at night well, I would recommend something else. All depends on what you're looking for. If you want a slight improvement over OEM, this one will do fine."
4,Fun game for the whole family,"Ruckus is a game that everyone can enjoy. It takes very little to learn, so young and old can play. The game is matching and stealing piles from other players. Once the game is started only does ruckus stop the chaos and diving across the table for a pile. When you play make sure to put drinks off the table!"
5,fun for everyone,I ordered this card game for a family party we had. Everyone from 8 years to 68 years had a blast. It got a little crazy and loud when we played. It is played best with 4 or 5 people. It also works best on a small table so that everyone can reach the other players piles of cards. It is basically a simple matching game. The cards are holding up great. It is very easy to learn and you can play many games without getting bored of it. It is one of our more favorite card games.
1,LEAD,"I purchased this game to have when my grandsons come to visit. My daughter-in-law looked at the box the cards came in and there is a warning. Made in China, This product contains lead!!!!!!!I returned it today.How can Amazon sell products for kids with LEAD???"
4,ruckus causes a ruckus,Have played a similar game with deck of regular cards .. this is equally as fun. great when you can get a lot of people.
2,Never took it out of box,"My grandchildren (ages 8 & 4) just were not interested in this game, and never opened it, even with urging from me. They like lots of other card games & board games, so I don't know what to think."
3,Ruckus: Table for Two (meh),"This card game is a lot of fun. We played it with two players, and though it's still fairly lively and fun, I could easily see how it would be more fun with more players. It's a fast game, and there's not much of a ""ruckus"" with just two. At one point we tried to go really fast and grab card matches and throw ours down and stuff. That was fun for a minute. I think with jello-shots, this would be awesome."
1,Read the Warning: Contains Lead,"Great game until I read the warning: Made in China. Warning: Contains Lead, May be harmful if eaten or chewed, may generate dust containing lead.After reading that...right into the trash."
1,Great game but CONTAINS LEAD,"Got this game for Christmas and my oldest 4 kids LOVE it. It wasn't until 7 months later that we noticed the warning on the box--""Made in China. Warning: Contains Lead, May be harmful if eaten or chewed, may generate dust containing lead.""Wish the description would have listed the dangerous warning and I wish they'd make them without lead. My kids loved the game."
4,Nothing else like it,"This is a very intense personal mind training program. It is not a brain washing. It is all about you. You make the choices. You answer the questions. You make it happen. But you must stick with it. If you can get through this program, you can do just about anything you want. If you have 30 minutes a day for a mnoth, this is for you!"
1,"Ouch! After the title track, not much here","Vandross's cover of ""Goin' Out of My Head"" is fine, reminiscent of work on 1994's 'Songs' album, but does not stand up to the original, or even Gloria Gaynor's cover.The title track: sensuous, moody, with Vandross's best soul flair. This song holds up to repeated listening, as Vandross finds himself decrying a lover who only wants him as a ""secret love."" Possibly Vandross's best song ever?The rest of the album falls apart with tracks that not only sound similar to each other, but similar to most songs Vandross has recorded. No new ground gets tread on this album.Beyond ""Your Secret Love,"" why bother with the rest of the album?"
4,"Not remixes,just extended versions........",Just a little more Michael for your money........I used to D.J. so I remember these mixes.Can't find U.S. versions so I'm happy I got this compliation.
3,"If you own Thriller, don't buy it!",Owners of Thriller should avoid this CD! The 12 inch Mixes are the same as the original songs on Thriller. P.S. Thriller is the greatest album ever!
4,Great for Fillable PDF Forms,"I have a lot of forms to fill out a work. I have always wanted to know how I could save some of the information I type into these PDF forms. These PDF forms are everywhere. With this software, I can convert a regular PDF form into a PDF form that saves whatever I type. Outstanding! I save a lot of time at work by not re-keying information in every time I open up that PDF."
3,Eh... Version 5 was fine.,"I've been a fan (and user) of Acrobat for many years, and am continually amazed by the number of organizations that *don't* circulate their documents in PDF format. I don't even *read* Word attachments anymore, for fear of viruses and because I *know* they won't look like the author intended.However, earlier versions have each added great new features, and the differences of v6 over v5 just don't seem substantial enough to warrant the price or effort of upgrading. For most users, I'd recommend saving dough by finding a copy of version 5, a vast improvement over versions 1 thru 4, and of course a conceptual and practical leap (or three) beyond sharing documents in native formats such as Word."
1,I HATE HATE HATE This version,"I primarily use Acrobat to scan hardcopy and then edit it. This allows me to send manuscripts electronically anywhere in the world.I skipped the 5.0 upgrade and got this instead. I have never been so sorry in all my life. I have had it a month so far and cannot get it to scan in color. Nor can I get it to accept more than 19 scanned pages at a time using the document feeder (Acrobat 4.0: 75-100 pages in True Color was no problem). The only thing better in this version is the arrows connecting the annotations to their place. Big deal. I have always preferred the text box anyway (e.g., for a general comment) and now you can't adjust the font size or type. Also, it constantly goes off the page. (Nice autowrap, not!) And to finish it all off, it is slow...slow...slow. Everything is slower. If you are going to read an online PDF using IE, go get a cup of coffee. Geez, we might as well be back in the days of dialup.Acrobat's competitors, listen up. Now is the time to pounce!"
1,Bugs and more bugs,I bought this product based upon the advertised new features about combining documents. After installing the product I found that the Adobe Distiller printer was no longer there and my program depended upon that printer. Eventually I got a printer set up and things working and then I found that when I moved bookmarks in my document and saved the file that the new locations for the bookmarks were not saved. Called help support and they said that it must be a problem with something I was doing (ever heard that before?). Problem never solved. The next problem that I encounter was out of warranty (one-month) and it was to late to return the product. I'll bet that if they gave a six month warranty they couldn't hire enough people to man the help desk. I think I have been had.
1,Lasted 1 day on my PC,"I downloaded an evaluation copy of Acrobat 6 before I read the reviews here. I can confirm what others are saying: unlike the upgrade from 4.0 to 5.0, 6.0 doesn't offer the average user additional usefulness over 5.0.It's also much slower to load and takes twice as long to creat .pdf files. The interface is completely different, so there will be a steep learning curve for users upgrading from previous editions. Sometimes, software developers just screw one up, and this one is such an upgrade.Pay close attention to the features you need: If you just want to print files to .pdf, you don't need all the stuff 6.0 offers. You'll never use 80% of the features they've added.After one day, I got frustrated, realized I didn't have the time to learn an entirely new piece of software so that I could simply continue to make .pdf files, and uninstalled it.Lesson learned: Check for reviews FIRST."
5,Good size and sturdy case,"I bought htis for my son who is a musician. It is light, sturdy and will hold a lot of music."
3,Nice Product - just not what was needed,"The portfolio is okay, it's was just not big enough so we had to return it. My daughter has 6-8 pieces of music she is working on at one time, so this was just not large enough for her."
2,An idea book; not an instruction book,"I'm a novice beader and have been referencing all kinds of books on French beading technique. Hiney's book was a BIG disappointment. I liked her ideas, especially when combining different types of beads, but I found her instructions to be unclear, and in some cases, like the pattern for the small butterfly, to be convoluted (twice around the barn to get to the house). If you are trying to teach yourself French beading technique, try books by Dalene Kelly and Carol Benner Doelp, the Nathansons of our time. Their books are well written, illustrated, and edited. If you want to make beautiful beaded flowers using crossover techniques, The Beaded Garden by Diane Fitzgerald is a terrific book, with clear instructions and lots of ideas."
1,love from a stranger,"Everything was fine until near the end of the movie, the dvd started slowing down and stopping, I was barely able to see the end. I liked the movie but the condition of the dvd was terrible."
2,Do not waste your money,"I owned one of these about two years ago,when they only cost $500.00 and I have to say it was the worst thing I have ever purchased and I have owned many Electric and Nitro Helicopters.This thing is a total pain to learn how to fly,I could not believe how hard it was to control,and this is from a person that has used RC Helicopters for over six years,I finally got tired of it and sold it on E-bay and used the money to purchase a Thunder tiger Raptor 60 which was much easier to fly than this!!!!Do not waste your money purchase a real RC Helicopter you will be much happier I sure was!!!!"
3,"Good Cookbook, but a lot of duplicates","I have a few wild game cookbooks, and when I purchased this book, I didn't realize that the title of the cookbook has changed, but the the vast majority of the recipes are the same from a previous cookbook I have from 10 years ago. The pictures inside the cookbook are the same from 10 years ago as well. So no true new recipes to choose from. I ended up returning the book (but had to pay shipping back to Amazon unfortuntately).If this is your first wild game cookbook, it is good. Just make sure you may not already have it in your pantry."
4,Good Information,"This book is very informative and has great illustrations. It's not an all inclusive hunting guide and for me this was a good thing. The author does a great job of showing readers how to get game meat from the hunting club to the dinner table. Straight and to the point this author does not ""chase rabbits"" (excuse the pun). I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to hone their butchering techniques or wanting a lot of really good recipes for wild game."
5,Wonderfully creative game cookbook for all experience levels,"Not only does this cookbook give valuable tips on the handling of game in the field and while butchering, it gives great recepies for the kitchen. All of the pages are filled with very useful photos. This book can be usefull to a hunter of any level of experience."
5,I just bagged a big one - Now what? Read this book.,"This is an awesome book for the beginner wanting to really get into butchering wild game correctly and efficiently. There are lots of step by step full color photos, detailed explanations, and very interesting recipes. In fact, many of the recipes sound like they'd be great with commercially available meat too. Tables and explanatory background make clear how the species, age, feeding habits, and such can affect the taste of your catch. The labeled pictures of actual deer hind-quarters and such was really helpful for me in knowing how to cut better to get that butcher-quality result. For instance, where is the eye of round? Sirloin tips? Bottom round? Now I have a point of reference between my skinned deer staring at me and the typical meat market terminology of what ""cuts"" we like best. The real photos are much better, I think, than the illustrations and diagrams you might find in other books."
3,Delussional days would be a better title.,"While i found this book worth reading (thus 3 stars) i also felt that Ms. Kennealy was more than a little in denial and maybe even a little delussional. Of course the book is ""her"" version of her relationship with Morrison and we will never know the whole truth. However, i found it quite annoying that while she tries so hard to convince the reader what a strong independant woman she is, she simultaneously told story after story of being walked all over by Morrison. She tells of what she and Morrison had as a sacred and everlasting bond, yet the story she tells of their ""relationship""(or times together) says something very different.I think the story she tells in this book is likely very true, and therefore worth reading. There are some great stories, glimpses at the real Jim Morrison, and alot of history there. It's simply her ""interpretations"" of the things that happened that i found (likely to be) far from the truth."
4,Review for Paul McCartney's Get Back,"Although Paul is getting older by the minute, I enjoyed the old Beatles songs and I liked the rare film footage of The Beatles. The footage that plays during his songs is very nostalgic and enjoyable. I enjoyed this video!"
3,"after the wait, quite a disappointment","Before you start jumping on me for giving anything related to Paul a low rating, please read what I have to say. I thought that since they waited so long to release this, it might be because they wanted to do a better job than they did on the Paul Is Live DVD. That DVD has no 5.1, either Dolby or DTS, and the sound output is anemic. So, I ordered this one, certain that it would be so much better. No dice. Again, no 5.1, no DTS, and anemic output, even worse than Paul Is Live. The things I didn't like about it first time around on VHS (editing, continuity)I still don't like.So, I'll wait for somebody to something right with a vintage Paul McCartney concert. I would love to see Unplugged, never released on video, done right in 5.1 DTS. That would be a show!!!"
3,Concert,The concert material was great. What I was not expecting was the Political propaganda mixed in with the concert. This made me a little upset.Nowhere on the packaging or description does it mention that it has political crap on this DVD
3,This Video Seemed Better 20 Years Ago,"Yeah, Paul is in fine form and director Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night, Help) adds some unneeded Beatles cache, but there are no shots of guitar solos and too much footage of the lame themed video from the big screen at the concert. The 1980's picture quality, which lacks definition and is slightly blurry does not hold up well viewing with today's 46 inch HD screen either. maybe if they remixed in 5.1 sound with a blu-ray video quality I would try again. Excellent versions of Sgt. Pepper, Carry That Weight, The End. Linda's there too. I am a lifelong Beatle fanatic."
2,Who dropped the ball?,"This is McCartney's first world tour since ""Wings Over America"" tour...And Richard Lester did not do this concert justice at all. The sound quality is ""fair"" not ""good or great""...editing was done carelessly and the picture quality is ""fair to good""Richard had no idea of which cameras to use for concert filming (compare this to The Band ""The Last Waltz""), coupled with the fact no one bothered to remaster the video and audio soundtrack on this DVD.But it was a good lesson for McCartney to learn, cause most of his other concerts after this were recorded in a much better fashion.If you are a McCartney/Beatle fan, as I am...this is nice to have to your collection, but not a priority."
3,"Paul, not the Beatles","Paul was never a great stage performer, merely a great composer. This concert DVD was less than perfect, with fuzzy historical footage for some works(Long and Winding Road) and mere concert footage for others. The stage, as is the wont of most concerts, was extremely dark, making for a frustrating visual tableau. During the Eleanor Rigby piece,, when a string quartet was on stage presumably, we do not even see them."
3,"Great Tour, poor DVD","This Macca tour was huge and great, but this DVD edition lacks of quality. Image is really granny as if they just copied from an old VHS tape. The sound is not 5.1The addins made by Richard Lester could have been put as a special feature, but not in the middle of songs!Said that, it is fair to say that the performance of Paul and the band is flawless."
5,Better than J-Pop,"I've never found J-pop appealing, so I had to overcome that bias in approaching this CD, but it is a wonderful disc, in turns playful, haunting and angry, but always beautiful and lyrical. Very worthwhile!"
5,Excellent Purchase - Great Picture,"We compared this TV to various 720p and 1080p rear projections by Samsung and Sony. The image quailty was by far better than the other 720p TVs that we saw and the features made it hard to justify the additional expense of the 1080p. Besides, the speakers do not stick out from the sides, offering a clean profile with excellent sound quality.The addition of a second HDMI port sealed the deal since I had only seen that feature on the 1080p models. I was able to connect the Cable box and upconvert DVD player (Toshiba) to the HDMI ports and direct the audio via the optical audio out to my stereo surround system."
1,Toshiba TV Bulb quit after less than 400 hours,"Nothing you haven't already seen in these reviews but I thought I would throw in my experience too. I bought this TV at Nebraska Furniture Mart thinking I was getting a really good deal about 18 months ago. The TV sits in our rec room that hardly ever gets used unless someone is on the treadmill. I figure 5 hours a week is generous. So after 18 months of use, the bulb blows. This TV should have lasted 15 years according to their figures. I have learned a very expensive lesson here."
3,"OK Picture, Poor Reliability","This is an OK TV. Picture quality is good, as is sound. Like other owners, we've replaced the bulb but will probably not do so again given the age of the TV, price of replacement bulbs, and the steadily decreasing price of new, better televisions. When the current bulb goes, the set is going to the dump.We've had several issues with black areas appearing on the screen. It turns out that there is tape in several locations inside the set that comes loose and droops, creating a shadow between the bulb and the mirror or viewing screen. Fortunately, it's easy enough to remove several screws around the rear edge of the screen, pop the screen off, cut or remove the offending tape inside the set, and then put things back together. Just be sure if you do this that you disconnect the power before taking things apart, and then don't touch or smudge the mirror or in the inside of the screen. It's not a difficult fix."
1,This is the worst TV ever.,"I don't know what's worse, the Toshiba TV or fridge we bought from Best Buy. Neither one worked well from the beginning. The bulb blew in the TV after a month and the fridge could never keep up with ice. After 4 years the fridge quit all together and the bulb just blew again. When we had the repairman out he said we would be throwing good money away repairing these items. I will never as long as I live buy another Toshiba product again nor will I shop at Best Buy. And, I make sure I tell anyone who will listen the same thing. Most of the time I hear people tell me they could have already told me that."
2,Its all about the lamp,"I have owned this TV for about a year and a half. The picutre is good, not great. I have a very light room and it doesn't have a great picture during the day. About 3 days ago I heard a loud pop and my lamp went out. They say the lamp should last about 7k hours. Since I didn't run my TV 13 hours per day, I think this is wrong. It looks like this is a very typical issue with Toshiba DLP TV's. I have even read that there are class action law suits regarding Toshiba and there DLP lamps. Its a good TV at a good price until you figure in the price of a new Lamp ($200) every year and a half. I would stay away from this TV or make sure that the lamp id included in any extended warranty that is available."
5,Great TV,"I have had this set for 1 year next week and LOVE IT. I have not had one single problem with it. The picture is killer and the features are simple to use. The only thing I dislike is the audio could be a little better, so I went out and purchased a surround sound to fix that problem. When I decide to upgrade to a larger viewing size in the next year or so, Toshiba will defiantly be on top of my list of brands."
2,Buyer Beware,"Purchased this television in July of 2006. Initially, I was very happy with the picture quality and ease of use. After six months and less than 800 viewing hours, I heard a big pop and realized the lightbulb had blown. Toshiba was good about replacing the bulb quickly but after the warranty is over, I cannot offord to spend a minimum of $300 a pop for new bulbs every few months. Basically, once the warranty is over I will have to chuck this television."
2,Planned Failure makes for hidden costs,"Its a great TV, good price for the size, but that low price hides the hidden cost.The $250 lamps. They last about year, (I got 18 months out of mine). You are essentially buying a $250 halogen lamp that should cost $50. So yah, its planned thing, a way for Toshiba to milk more money out of you. And any time they want to force you to buy a new TV all the need to do is stop making that lamp.Spend a bit more on a LCD TV, or another brand entirely.It does get 2 stars for being a good TV, as long as you pay the yearly ""subscription"" charge to use it."
1,50HM66 is a waste of money,This TV is inadequate at best. Picture quality is sub par and can be bested by purchasing an analog rear projection TV. I have had mine 1 year less 4 days and have replaced the lamp twice. The lamps are lasting 6 months at best and this will be my last free lamp as the warranty expires in 4 days. At $200 per lamp who can afford to purchase two lamps per year. This effectively makes the TV worthless. At what point do you cut your losses and run?If concidering purchaing go with another brand.
5,A essential source on Middle East politics,"I concur entirely with the previous review, except that I would award the book five stars rather than three. It is rather sterile to view this book only as fodder for academic discourse. It is, in fact, essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the Middle East in the 20th century."
4,Storrs Available via Kessinger Publications!,"So happy to get a sample of a book printed on demand from Kessinger! Want more ... ! Quality of paperback is very satisfactory. Service was prompt. How about having Kessinger make available reprints of works by Gen. George Fletcher MacMunn: any of his will do ... like an autobiography, or one of his works on Kipling and/ about India under the English Raj. All are colorful stuff!"
5,Wow - very nice,"I used this with my computer hooked up to my TV with the sound going to my surround sound system. Then I grew up and got rid of my computer and hooked a bluetooth receiver to this cable and piped that to my surround sound system.With both incidences the audio was 100% perfect. I was surprised. 25 feet, a cheep cable, and great sound. A+ I'm happy with this cable."
5,A MUST FOR ANYONE SUFFERING FROM TMJ!,"IF YOU SUFFER, AS I DO, FROM TMJ DISORDER THIS BOOK IS A MUST. IT OFFERS INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSES OF TMJ, AS WELL AS PRACTICAL AND VERY HELPFUL HINTS TO MANAGE YOUR CONDITION AND AIM YOU TOWARD RECOVERY. REALLY PUT MY FEARS TO REST AND GAVE ME SOMETHING CONCRETE TO WORK WITH AFTER NEARLY A YEAR OF MISDIAGNOSES AND TERRIBLE ANXIETY OVER A CONDITION NO DOCTOR SEEMED ABLE TO FIGURE OUT! DO YOURSELF OR A LOVED ONE A FAVOR IF THEY SUFFER FROM TMJ, BUY THIS BOOK! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5,Book Works Well and Fast,I was amazed doing the simple exercises in this book for 2 weeks took all of my jaw pain away. Better than anything a dentist can give you for the pain.
4,Good relaxation excersizes,"My jaw was locked for 3 coming on to 4 weeks when I gave into buying this. I did some of the excersises and slowly my jaw losend up. If you are locked up use caution on one of the excersises, it has a disclaimer by it."
1,Doesn't work for everyone,"Hi. I rate this book 1 star not because it is a poorly written book, but to bring to your attention that this book, in regards to ""self help"" does not work for everyone.I bought this book due to all of the 5 star reviews and declarations that individuals found immediate relief from some of the things in this book. I am very happy for their results. I wasn't expecting immediate relief, but I was expecting more effective self-help techniques and less recommendations to go to more doctors and spend more money.Everything I found in this book I have found numerous times on the internet for free. The self-help area did not work for me. The recommendations to go to different doctors was not what I wanted, as I've already spent $9K on the problem.It's a well written, informative book if you've done no research on your own about TMJ dysfunction. However, I think you can find everything in this book pretty easily on the internet for free."
5,Actually Changed My Life,"The book didn't solve all my pain, and I don't know if it'll work for everyone....but I can say that this book changed my life.The simple exercises provided quick relief of my jaw problems. I only do the jaw/neck/shoulder ones, and not the full body stretching program. Unfortuntately, I'm so lazy that I don't keep up with them and I go right back to where I was."
1,Fibromyalgia Help?,"I am an expert in the subjects being covered.A PhD. in the field and 61 years of experience working with people who suffer,as I do.The book is a waste of hope,time and money..thus bringing on more depression in my patients.So sad.Dr.Daniels"
5,Life-saving !,This product lived up to what I was hoping for..Just the exercises alone and the tonque placement was so helpful. I am enjoying it more each reading and finding answers I was looking for. Nancy
5,night time dry eye,just what i looking for and arrives on.great for dry eyes and i know that if any one is looking for something for dry eye Try this product its wonderful.
3,okay...I guess.,I got this CD for two songs i couldn't find on itunes. they are really nice. the other songs are standard issue. but a bargain for the price.
5,The best movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie, it is more enjoyable than previous MLK movies. The soundtrack is awesome!"
3,?,"Well, this is odd. Who wrote the songs on this album? Are the songs any good? Do we care enough to buy this album?Life is full of questions. Maybe one day they will be answered. Until then, I will stick with Squarepusher, Richard D. James, etc. for my drum 'n' bass kicks.Fini."
3,Eh.,"I don't know, I think this is christian created art - they're covering themselves, we don't really practice human sacrifice as part of our modern paganism, though small groups seem to follow christian patterns and worship predators, practice human sacrifice, much of our religion is a genuine alternative to child torture, animal torture, human torture male supremacist predator ideology. Men and women drawn to it are trying to escape tyranny, so don't know if I like this dark weird version. Our fertility rites are symbolic not kill and torture the virgin literally like christians do. if you knew how they suffered you would nearly die from grief. I've seen their handiwork, so please pagan community don't buy into this cheap copy of their cruelty cult which is swallowing up the world."
1,Disappointing,"I looked forward to seeing this film based on the synopsis and reviewers comments. I enjoy fictionalised historical films IF they are acted well and the story flows. Sadly, neither happened in this film. It may be pretty to watch but that is all. The acting was dreadful, the script very poor and frankly the characters were one dimensional. I am sure this story could have been done really well but it wasn't. I persevered through the 95 minutes only because I had spent money on this dvd. It will be consigned to the garden to scare off the birds. Not recommended."
4,It is NOT 9 inches in length,"Works fine and is durable. The specifications say 9 inches long, it is 7 inches long."
2,Not a excercises but a translation of a Sutra,This book refers to philosophical basis of Buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion. It is not a manual nor a guide. No Meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book. the style is simbolic and poetical. it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content. It will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work.
5,All there is to it,"Through the straightforwardness and clear simplicity of its messages, this magnificent little book is pure Zen at its best."
1,Its only 23 pages!!,A total rip-off. The description should say that this 'book' is more like a 23 page pamphlet with fuzzy picture reproductions and short descriptions that provide little information. Not worth the shipping charge.
4,Good product,"I like this charger, very small and portable. Sony shoud sell a extra battery / charger combo. I sure recommend it for taking vacations."
5,Thunder Road,"I really appreciate the prompt service. Some recordings on this CD were written by my father Roger Christian including Custom Carnival and Ballad of Bonneville which was mistakenly credited to Burns and Usher. The facts of the actual credit for those (2) song were Christian & Usher. Roger wrote many other great songs for the Beach Boys, Don't Worry baby, Little Deuce Coupe, Shut Down, Spirit Of America and many more Hits. He also wrote for Jan & Dean, Dead Man's Curve, Little Old Lady From Pasadena, Drag City and many many more hits. He wrote for 63 Groups and Solo Artist in all.

2,Stick with the Original,"A big fan of both Leslie Cheung and Joey Wong, I was disappointed with the Sequel when compared to the original - The original remains a classic, while the Sequel feels like it was hastily put together to ride the success of the original. What I really didn't like about the movie was the very fake looking ghost/monster...whatever you prefer to call it - okay, even though this was back in the 80s, but I am sure they could have come up with better stuff than that. Leslie revives the role of the helpless scholar/tax collector who is neither a martial arts expert nor a monk who can rid evil to the tee, Joey plays a new character who resembles the original 'ghost', Jacky Cheung is definitely a great addition to the movie but the plot definitely lacks the momentum of the original movie. Some great comical moments."
2,"Not as good as the first one, but still fun","The second installation falls short of the high standards of eroticism and humor and is not as scary as original Chinese Ghost Story. The plot (what there is of it) is less well defined and the emphasis is more on the humor, which is a little labored. All this is not to say that the film is not fun and worth watching, merely that it is not the classic that the first one is. Good but not spectacular special effects. I think one should definately watch these films in sequence, or you'll be left out in the dark a lot."
2,"Beautiful film, but terrible tape quality","Just a word of caution - the VHS tape of this movie is of terrible picture quality. It looks like a bad, amateurish copy made from an already very worn master tape. I once saw a movie that had been filmed off a cinema screen with a standard video camera, and the result was similar...! :-) A real pity because the film, in its original quality, is a feast for the eyes."
4,great,"This is the second episode of a chinese ghost story. the story has a bit of continuation from the first movie. although i feel that it is not as good as the first one, this movie is still very watchable!! highly receommend."
2,The worst of the trilogy,"With much lower production values and a storyline that is recycled at best, and boring at its worst, I would definately stay clear of this one.Part one is gorgeous, with bright colors and fun action with a plot that entertains and intrigues. This one is like watching a saturday morning cartoon from the 80s, filled with floppy jokes and bad acting.90 minutes of my life I'll never get to have back..."
3,It's really Chinese Ghost Story III,"I'm not sure what the previous viewer is refering to, but this is the final (so far, and hopefully always) chapter in the Chinese Ghost Story trilogy. The first one came out in '87, then '90 and '91. This film is decent, good fight sequences, though it is weaker in the specail effects than the previous films. However Leslie Cheung is not in this film (par the previous film) and Joey Wong has a diminished role in this one. Three might be a crowd. Check out the other two before you see this one."
4,Much better than the fist one,"Only a few of the sequel is better than the fist one. This movies is no lesser romance, more funnier, more actions, better special effect and Joey Wang is more beautiful (and less nudity). There are 2 more main characters which added more color to the stories, ""the General"" who is extremely good with the sword arts and another ghost-buster guy who is really funny.I saw special edition dvd which speaks madarin and cantonese and has 8-10 languages subtitles. The dvd quality is great, I was hoping that they will add the behide the scene features, star interview (I am a forever fan of Leslies Chueng, since I was a teenager) to be more fun.If you wanna spend $37 one of the movies for one of the chinese ghost stories, buy this one."
5,LIKE the Tobacco industry coverup!,"Blaylock has nothing to gain by informing patients about the dangers he describes in this book, aside from piece of mind. In fact he could lose a lot of patients with neuro disorders, since they would be cured if they became aware of this information and took action to protect themselves. Thanks, to a doctor who is truly in this business to help others and improve the health of humans. Unlike many who just assume you stay ill. Enough of consumers being tricked, lied to and poisoned for the profits of big industry. Thanks Dr. Blaylock. I am free of migraines, palpitations, and asthma for the first time in my life, thanks to your book."
5,Excitotoxins,"I always wondered why I got headaches when I consumed MSG and now I know. I applaud Dr. Blaylock's bookand hope everyone takes time to read it. There are so many chemicals in everything we eat, do, and useevery day. This book has heightened my awareness that natural organic products and foods are the way to go!"
1,What a Crock!,"Sure, Aspartame kills. Tell me another one! This is a woefully ignorant and intentionally deceptive collection of pseudo-science and conspiracy theories. Pardon me while I drop this book in the recycling bin and get another diet Coke out of the refrigerator."
1,crackpot,"bottom line...If you believe in conspiracy theories, You'll like and believe this book. If you believe in real science, then don't waste your money."
1,"Potentially good information, EXCEPT...","...EXCEPT for the fact that there are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAyyyyyyyyy too many grammatical errors (misspelled words, etc). I began by looking at the brief preview and just could not get passed all the misspellings. Any book worth the price should have been ""worked"" by the publisher to get rid of the ""dribble"". Apparently, whomever the editor of this book is, they did a poor (if any) job of ""editing"".Too bad, because the information in the book is otherwise valuable. I'm an old Catholic School boy... taught by nuns. This book reminds me of my days in Engineering School... and an old saying... ""When I was young, I wanted to grow up to be an engineer, and now I ARE one""!!!Hey, ""Doc"", how about a rewrite WITH CORRECTIONS!"
2,What are you trying to say...,Not that good. I've read a lot and just felt this book was a bad read.
2,Useful although narrow,"This book is mostly about links between MSG and Alzheimers/Parkinson's. It goes into a lot of scientific detail about prior studies, brain function, etc.Unfortunately, I was already sold onto the idea that MSG etc are bad substances, so most of the book was irrelevant to me. I was looking for ways to find foods that are MSG free. In that pursuit, only the last 2 pages of the book help: list of common names of MSG or MSG-containing substances on food labels. The book was not practically useless, therefore.While reading this book, please realize that MSG and NutraSweet are not the only problematic food additives. There are preservatives like BHT etc added to foods esp meats, and those are also suspected to have negative health effects. Yet this book does not discuss them (maybe they are not exactly neuro-exciters).Overall, could be good reading for some, but I found minimal use of this book."
5,Please dont eat any E-s ...ist poison,"i suffered from an terrible car accident after 2 aspartame drinks in July 2010, and I am sick for one year, and I lost my car driver licence ... they think I would be an epileptic, but I am not. After those drinks I went very fast in an status of coma, realizing this I slept for one hour in the car. I woke up, disturbed, an not knowing what I wanted to do, and trying to find it out, driving carefully back home, an aspartame cause epileptic event happend. I lost control, the foot cramped and pushed the gas pedal, an I craseh with 110 km/h against a wall, I woked up in hospital. NEVER ASPARTAMEand dont forget, even milk ist artifical changed, and to much soja also hurts ... we should eat fruits, herbs, roots, nuts ... as most natural as possible ... I LOVE YOU ALL"
4,Very eye opening and lots of good info.,"This book taught me a lot about excitotoxins, how the industries hide them in our food, and has made me realize how little the FDA cares about the average human well being. It's simply quite shocking. In short this book tells us what effects these food additives can and do have on the human brain. It can be like reading a coursebook at times but the valuable information outweighs the boring moments and the over used analogies."
5,Shocking,"Blaylock takes complicated neuroscience and makes it accessable to most. With US healthcare in crisis, learning all one can to AVOID ANY system of disease management is a must. Get this book."
4,This will change your eating habits forever,After reading this book I have become VERY careful about not consuming any foods or drinks with aspartame or MSG in them. The book explains how these ingrediants contain Aspartate and Glutamate and these are the amino acids that can be used by the neurons in the brain to transmit signals to each other. If we increase these in our blood stream to a large enough amount they will cross the blood brain barrier in most people and burn out neurons. Long term over dose can lead to burning out sections of the brain that can cause seizures and alzheimers.It is a tough clinical read but well worth it.
5,An invaluable resource!,"A Guide to the C.S. Lewis Tour in Oxford is a ""must have"" for any admirer of C.S. Lewis that plans to visit Oxford, or simply wants to know more about Lewis's home and haunts. The book consists of roughly 44 brief vignettes (or chapters), each one dedicated to a specific person or place made famous by Lewis.There are two things I enjoy most about this book. The first is the unpretentious, relaxed writing style that makes the reader feel as if he or she is on the tour listening to the author share his stories, and the second is the intimate knowledge of the many people and places referenced by the author, which gives it a highly personable quality."
4,The tough and dreamy world of golf,"When I read this book I had never played golf in my life. Nevertheless, I laughed and enjoyed it as I have all other books by Wodehouse. Later on I had a chance to learn this sport, and one of the reasons for my accepting this new way of relaxation and exercise was (what else?) remembering the hilarious situations that develop in the links dear P.G. takes us through. Walking along the golf course has made me appreciate even more the depth of Wodehouse's humor."
4,Golf humor,"This book was highly recommended in Book Lust as the funniest novel about golf ever. having read other recommendations from that book, I would vouch for this one although I bought it as a gift and haven't read it."
3,A little better than the original,"Similar to the original without ""Live By Yo Rep"" & ""Back Against Da Wall."" Features hot new song ""War With Us"" and filler ""We Got Da Dope""."
5,lil larry,I thought when I first bought I made a stupid choice but then I realized that it had two new songs on it and the older song sounded much better because paul and juice rerecorded it in there hypnotize minds studio and it came out louder and everything.
4,Lots and lots of pictures!,"I bought this book to help me to identify and differentiate between various models of Case construction equipment, mainly, and it helped out considerably, and although I would have preferred to have seen pictures of every model they put out, it probably just isn't possible! But a very informative book, about both the farm and heavy machinery sides of Case."
2,Manual & on screen menu very difficult to interpret.,"I purchased the DRC8300N a few weeks ago from another on-linecompany (not Amazon) and shipped it back today. It was a very frustrating experience...trying to get the unit to record withthe remote that came with it. To get it to work (record) I hadto use two remotes, the universal remote that came with it and the remote from my TV. (Not supposed to use 2 remotes).A technician tried to walk me through the menu, but itdidn't work for him either. The on-line tech agreed that the manual or something was misleading. Told me I could return it.Good luck if you buy one.PS: Amazon has a Sylvania Model DVR90VE that I may buy soon."
1,Worked for less than one week....,"I bought this DVD Recorder at Wal-Mart, and it stopped functioning properly in less than a week. It refused to record anything after day four, it froze up every time and I had to reset the unit. It kept weird time on my clock too, it was never right.Save yourself some time and SKIP this RCA Recorder. I returned it with no hassle, and picked up a Panasonic---no problems whatsoever, should have bought it first!"
1,a few downfalls,"the only thing i know is a major problem is the remotes with these units are no good!!!! and you can't get a replacement, I have been waiting for it since February..another downfall, is there customer service sucks.. they do not follow up on anything!!! and its also outsourced to another country.. customer service tells you stuff and never follows through.. I have also another dvd recorder(RCA) that has been trouble since we had it!!! no good"
1,Not a so good Recorder,I bought this item hoping to save space by using a combo that I could use one machine to copy the tape to DVD. But when I put in old tapes they looked terrible but when I used another DVD/VCR combo that I have had a few years the tapes looked much better. When I used this RCA to record from the TV either to a DVD or Video tape they looked very bad so now I had to hook-up my older Combo to the TV to record from the TV onto Video tape and if I want to record to DVD I have to use the older combo to play the tape in then I can use The RCA DRC8300 to record onto DVD. If I had to do it again I would never buy this item. I should of bought a panasonic. This Item is thee worst that I have ever bought never again.
2,RCA DRC8300N DVD VCR Recorder Combo,"I bought this DVD VCR combo recently to convert my old VHS tapes to DVD. The VCR part of this combo does not work too well. The quality of VCR play back of old tapes (10/15 years) is poor. However, the same old tapes play quite well in another stand alone old RCA VCR. So I am using my old VCR to play the old tapes and using the DVD part of the combo to record it. The manual is neither well written nor well organized. RCA could do a lot better job than that."
1,Bad Buy,"My recorder has not worked from day one. The VCR will not play many of the things that I have recorded in the past. Also, the unit requires me to input the date and time every time I turn it on. Once this fine piece of electronic equiptment starts to fail, you'll find that the thompson help line operators read directly from the manual. If you already looked in the trouble shooting section of the manual don't waste your time waiting for an operator, just try to return it as soon as possible."
5,"well-written, readable work on High Venetian art","This book is a great introdcution to Venetian art of the Renaissance, through its views of the major artists of the time (the Bellinis, Titian, Pollaiuolo, Veronese, etc.), but it incorporates enough social, religious, and political history that one not only gets a more-well rounded view of the Venice of the Renaissance, but also is not bogged down in excessive stylistic analysis. This makes Brown's work a wonderful introduction to the Venetian novice, which many amateur art-historians caught up with Florence and Rome (myself included) tend to be."
4,Art as a political and social tool,"Patricia Brown's Art and Life in Renaissance Venice provides an interesting analysis of what made Venice artistically and politically different from the other Italian city-states. Brown argues that Venetian ""otherness"" made its art distinguishable from the art of other Renaissance states. Venice's political and social stability impacted the nature of both art and architecture. Venetian art reflected these and in so doing promoted traditional social and political attitudes.The strength of Brown's work is the impressive artwork included in the text. The art is used quite convincingly by Brown to show how artists adapted to the demands of the Venetian public."
5,Important Book,"This is an academically sound and readable book. I highly recommend to my beginning art history students. It is a brief, but skillful purview of the Venetian Renaissance. The discussion of media and processes is particularly helpful."
4,If you're a fan of the movie only,"Most of the tracks are actual clips from the movie, containing only 5 or so actual songs. Its worth it for idle's hit always look on the bright side of life, which is the 3 minute song he sings at the end of the movie. If you are just looking for Bright Side of Life, you probably can find it in another Monty Python compilation with songs from others Monty Python movies, but if you are a fan of Life of Brian you get some audio quotes and a few other songs from the movie."
3,Edited badly!,"Beware - some of the selections have been trimmed to get rid of what the obviously clueless editor thought was ""dead space"". I noticed it specifically in the sketch where Brian is brought before Pilate for the first time. Much of the humor of the ""Biggus Dickus"" sketch depends on pregnant pauses, which have been obliterated in this version, as has, consequently, the masterful humor and tension of the scene. Bad editor! What's the point of releasing a comedy soundtrack if the comedy is destroyed? It would be better for those interested in the soundtrack to simply record the dialogue directly from the movie for themselves.It brings to mind the old joke...""Ask me what the most important thing about comedy is.""""What's the most important thing a-""""Timing."""
2,"Cute, if you can get it to work!","Christmas morning, my daughter tears the paper off this toy and is soooo exited. What a disapointment. Nothing I did caused the tail to wag, the leg to move and no licking action. I changed the batteries, still nothing. After hours of trying to get it to work, I went on line here and read somebody elses review about rubbing under the collar VERY HARD. Finally, the tail wagged, the foot moved and then, it actually licked. What a piece of work, very cute but WAY too much work. In time, I will eventually rub all the fur off under the collar. Save your money."
3,Tiresome Toy!,"My daughter was very excited to receive this toy, after putting in the 4 batteries, we too had to rub the dogs head and back of the collar continuously and hard over and over again. It did what it says, barks, barks louder and moves it one hind leg, it licks too, hasn't licked ""wet"" for us yet, and we are both tired of rubbing its head we let it rest!!! It was definitely too expensive for what it does."
1,Didn.t do anything it said it would do!,this was a nice ideal but it didn't do anything it said it would do
1,"Lousy ""Love n' Licks""","I bought 2 of these things for my granddaughters. I could NOT get either one to give a ""wet"" lick. However, the tongue did move and it made a licking sound. It was almost pornographic!"
2,Roll Away Piano,"I thought this product would be much like an electric keyboard. It is sort of fun trying out all the things that it can do but when it comes to actually playing a song it seems only 1 or 2 keys can be pressed at the same time to play a song. It seems of good quality. It is very portable and rolls away, it plays different tones and rythms, it just isn't easy to play songs unless you like to play a song with one finger just trying to play a tune. It is quiet (no motor noises) but it just isn't what I thought it would be. It would be good for a child who wanted to pick out tunes."
2,long,"It was a book. A long book. A long pointless book. On the positive side, it wasn't overly exciting, and it told us a lot about dresses. That's good, right? Yep, it was long. Read A Game of Thrones instead!And did anyone else notice that Mat wasn't in this book for a page? I like Mat. Mat is long."
1,Uuuuugh........,"I'm totally po'd that I ever got involved with this series. Here's the deal RJ: I don't need to read another 4 page description of what kind of dresses the women are wearing ok? Get on with the story. The sad part is, it started out to be a fantastic story, but virtually nothing has happened in the last 1500 pages of the series. Dissappointing to say the least."
2,Tangled web that isn't worth the effort.,It was as if Robert Jordon just wants to keep you coming back for another book. I really want to have some sort of fullfilment but there isn't any here. The wonderfully complex characters of the first four books have turned into boring caricatures. Where is Matt and who cares. This is like watching an old boxer who will not quit. It is sad. Robert Jordan should have ended this at book five. I for one do not care any more.
1,it's a shame really,"this 'book' was pure drivel. honestly, i believe you could skip this installment in the series and not miss a thing. the characters are now predictable and really annoying(everytime nynaeve tugs on her braid i feel like punching her in the face). the plot is absolutely dead, i cant think of any substantial events that occured in this book, however the end seems to indicate book 9 may be a good one, but i doubt it. i loved the first couple books in this series, so i'll give it one more shot and read book 9, but if things dont drastically improve i say farewell to this series. and it is a shame, because it was once very promising, and now a seemingly endless bore. this series could be compared to a marathon runner 'hitting the wall', and maybe(hopefully) it'll get its 'second wind' by the next book. i sincerely hope jordan decides to stop tapping this series for all the money he can get out of it, and focus on quality rather than quantity."
5,All Hail Robert Jordan! King of Fantasy! Long May He Reign!,"This book presents itself on the back of seven previous books in the series that were, to say the least, action-packed. Therefore, it came as no surprise to me that this book was decidedly 'slower' than the previous books. Jordan had to write a book that links book seven and book nine, and the Path of Daggers was what he came up with.Faced with a Seanchan Army, itinerant Aes Sedai, hidden supporters of the Dark One and hundreds of powerful Asha'manrepressed at the Black Tower, Jordan could do nothing else without making the Wheel of Time series obsolete for those who matter;the readers. The developments of the characters and plot reflect two things: firstly, the restrictions under which Jordan was under to maintain the integrity of his series;secondly, the innovative genius of Jordan. Never in my many years of devoted reading have I witnessed such burgeoning of ability under pressure from fans and publishers."
2,So many pages - so few events,"I'd like to start by stating that I'm a huge fan of Robert Jordan's previous books, but every book since # 6 feel like he is milking his readership and writing for the money rather than for the story. Literally 3 or 4 events occurred in this book - Nothing is happening in the series since book 6.Please Mr Jordan, give us a book like books 1 - 6 and let us know how the series ends. Some suggestions... Moiraine returns from limbo where she was sent (book ?), Lan unites the north behind Rand, Perrin unites old Manetheran, Matt is the general, they all meet to fight the Trollocs, etc., and Rand and company win. Rand writes a book entitled ""From there and back again"" and sails off with the Seachan. The end. Please, please, finish this up versus making me read through endless details of no value to the series. The last few books have felt like reading the phone book. These books aren't cheap and you are close to loosing me."
2,:::groan:::,"It's official, the WOT series ground to a screeching halt in book 8. The characters kept me involved in the first seven despite the pacing, which runs slower than a bottle of Heinz Catsup. But in book 8, Jordan has lost me. The man must get paid by the word, that's the only explanation I can come up with for the level of detail he goes in to. It is completely unnecessary, especially EIGHT books in to an endless series.And I must say, from the beginning all of the comparisons to Tolkien struck me as laughable at best. It's not bad for brain candy (which we all need sometimes, right?) but is nothing particularly intellectual, insightful or meaningful."
2,Dissapointed,"After such a long and painful wait for the next book in this great series, I was totally disappointed. As I read I kept hoping the story would pick up the pace but it never did. I won't be waiting for the next book with as much anticipation. I think Jordan is just writing now to get books on the shelf.Maybe he should wrap this series and start a new one, he is a very talented writer."
1,Disappointed Fan: Is Jordan Being Paid By the Word?,"I loved the first few books in this series because Jordan had a wonderful idea, but Jordan's latest volume exasperates me. I finished Path of Daggers, but it was agonizing.Good writers know when to bring closure to their epic sagas. Bad writers continue to write long books with too many characters and leaving too many questions unanswered - even in its eighth volume! Such irresponsible is not warranted.J.R.R. Tolkien and Herbert Frank represent hallmarks of the fantasy/science fiction genre. They were able to convey their epics in the time-honored three-volume trilogy. Jordan presumes that his Wheel of Time series is worthy of 8+ volumes (and his volumes are long). Sorry Jordan, WoT is not worthy.Jordan's writing reminds me of a time when writers write because they were paid by the word."
1,It's Way Past Time to End This Madness,"How long must this Series go on? Mr. Jordan seems intent on taking what should have been a Trilogy (ok, 4 volumes at the most) and turning it into a Baker's Dozen of books.Nothing original here. It's the same old, same old, again and again. Rand almost goes mad again (surprise, surprise) but can't quite get over the top. What a shame to see an excellent premise turn into a sham by churning out meaningless book after meaningless book."
2,Path of Daggers,"I Have just read the 8th book in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, and I have liked it a little more then the last two. However, I don't think it should have taken us 8 books to have gotten this far. Mr. Jordan has been way to wordy. I can read everyother page and not loose any of the story line. I didn't feel this way in the begining of the series. Also, I do not feel that Mr. Jordan and Tolkien should be mentioned in the same breath. They are totally different writers."
1,How the mighty have fallen.,"When I first started reading Robert Jordan I was amazed. His story was epic and intriguing. All the way to Book 6 it built in a crescendo of power and wonder. Then came Crown of Swords. Oh my God that was such a disapointment. I felt that for sure Path Of Daggers would be better. Every author has mistakes. Unfortunately this book is awful. Pointless. Wandering around without a clue. I count myself a devoted fan but I can't absolve Mr. Jordan. I can't be that forgiving. What an awful novel. The next one I'm not buying till i've read it from the library. And if this one has no redeeming qualities, I'm afraid I'm going to have to call it quits on the Wheel of Time"
2,Is this the downpayment on Jordan's dream house?,"I am disappointed. I have been an avid fan since the series first came out. However the plot and the characters could be developed much more quickly. I think that Jordan has sold out to the promise of big bucks if he keeps the story running. Jordan, please do not turn this story into a serialized penny dreadful! There is still time! End it with the next book, no matter how long it is!P.S. Kill Nynaeve! Please!"
3,"yes, where is Mat","i must agree with the popular consensus that this book is a bit of a dissappointment. it seems to me that the book was 25 chapters too long for the information contained. the writing is still exceptional as in all of jordan's works. however the book does very little in the furtherment of the plot. there are so few developments large or small that could possibly justify such an intensive work in terms of the time it took to produce. overall this particular book is lacking in comparison to the others of this series, but it must be remembered that this series is the formost literary work of its kind ever. the wheel of time series is an incredible experience that deserves every word of praise it has recieved."
1,"After so long a wait, this book is a MAJOR disapointment!","First let me state the I am a BIG ""Wheel of Time"" fan.The series had been developing at a certain pace. Just the right mix of action and detail. Now it is getting bogged down in detail only. At this rate it may take a 100 volumes to compleate the series.I hope that book 9 will be better."
3,It was disipointing !!!,I have waited for what seems like an eternity for Robert Jordan to tie up some of the problems facing the characters but instead he makes more problems. Most of his books are action packed put this one seemed empty and what little action there was took forever to come at this pace he will have to write a 1000 books he's inventing enemies faster than rand can deal with them and also he never really kills anyone off there is always they come back alive . what happened to mat? long can someone live under a colapsed wall there are getting to be so many enemies it's starting to get confusing he should kill some off . but if you read the others you will have to read this one and the others to come I've been caught in the wheel of time net
1,Tired of...,"This series (up to book 4/5) was one of my favorites. There were little things that bugged me, but I considered it to be a masterpiece.A coupld of things have caused me to completely give up on this series after this book.* Detail is great and all, but please make something happen. There are very few books that I haven't finished, but I was close with this one due to the lack of real events furthuring the story.* ENOUGH with the 'Men are stupid, tug on my braids' mentality! RJ likes to infuse his charecters with the inability to understand the opposite gender. When will they learn what most mature adults learn? If I didn't know better I'd say that RJ is a feminist man-hater.I could overlook these annoyances when the rest of the story was fantastic, but that just isn't the case with this book."
1,Send a message - don't buy the next one,"Having been an avid reader of TWOT in the begining, I have given up and plan not to buy another book. The author has either run out of ideas or decided that he is just going to profit from the stupidity of the gullible population hooked of the previously good work. No new developments, no plot to speak of, boring repetetivness of phrases used in previous books, just plain cheap imitation of fantasy prose. Perhaps if no one buys the next book, it will send a strong enough message to the author - I for one hope so."
1,Attention Robert Jordan,"This message is for Robert Jordan. FOR ALL THAT IS DECIENT AND HOLY-SPEED IT UP, SPEED IT UP, SPEED IT UP! SPEED IT UP NOW!I read like an alcoholic drinks, but this can sober up any addict. I read the first 5 books in a four week time period while going to school and working. Given that, I think this series needs something new: an ending! Zero stars for this book."
2,Where is Mat?,"Let me just say I don't intend to buy another volume in this series. My favourite character makes virtually no appearance in this book. Jordan seems to have written this book just to see how many suckers there are in the world. In fact, I'm getting tired of this whole series. There are too many characters to keep straight. I think he's done a masterful job of creating a world and cultures (or adapting those of Earth) but I think it's time for him to end it. I'll keep reading the books; I'm too vested in the characters by this time - but I don't recommend this series to new fantasy readers anymore."
1,Thoroughly disappointing,Sadly this once so promising series has deterioated into what can only be described as writing for the sake of writing (or perhaps a bigger bank account). It ranks as the single most boring - not necessarily the worst - book I've read in years.I was skimming chapters continually and still I had difficulty in actually finish the thing! His characters have all turned into one dimensional cartoons and his female portraits seems to be carbon copies of each other. Reading this series stops here.
2,Disappointing,"I've finally read the latest in the wheel of time series. For incurable Jordan addicts such as myself, it's mandatory reading, but... It does NOT resolve any significant issues. Yes, The weather is repaired (but we all saw that coming in the last volume) It seems that Jordan gives us 500 pages of writers' block. The overall plot doesn't really advance. When I finished it, I felt that nothing had gotten done; that Jordan was saving the answers and resolutions for the inevitable 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, and probably 20th volumes."
4,Greater than the sum of its parts,"Not my favorite, but an excellent book. I am an avid fan of Jordan's WOT series and believe it is truly one of the masterpieces of modern fantasy. Some have said they find Path of Daggers to be somewhat lacking. I believe that the strength of this book cannot be accurately judged until the series is finished, or at the very least without considering the WOT as a whole in relation to this book. Each book has its role in the scheme of the series, and this book (despite -- or perhaps because of -- a slower pace, less action, and the absence of Mat) will ultimately enrich and strengthen this masterpiece. Music is composed of varied notes, paintings have innumerable shades, and Jordan has written eight books with different strengths, different feels, and each with a different purpose in mind."
3,A good read for WOT readers but slower than earlier novels.,"I did enjoy reading this book (after what seemed to be an endless wait since book 7 of WOT). I was a bit disappointed not finding out what happened to Mat and in general, wished for more resolution. RJ continues to develop more characters (as if there aren't enough to keep track of) and unveiled several minor surprises along the way. Hopefully, we won't have to wait 2+ years for book 9 as I am ready for it to be out!"
4,It's finally here!!!!!,"I'm only about half way through with this book and this book definitely keeps up with the rest of the books that Robert Jordan has written. The only disappointing fact about this book is the fact that it hasn't covered all the characters, Matt, was one of the characters that is tied in with the Seanchan and nothing about him has been discussed. This book definitely is leading up the ninth book and I can't wait to finish up this book and get onto the process of waiting for book 9."
2,I waited 2 years for this?!?!?,"This book was a severe disappointment. I don't feel like typing a whole bunch here so I'll just say that I just finished a 600 and some page book that absolutely nothing happened! I can't believe Jordan published this book. It could have been summarized in about 100 pages and then he could have actually have something interesting happen for another 500 pages. If this is the way the series is going to continue then I might stop reading it(yeah right). Oh well, maybe book nine..."
3,Time for a database,"This book is necessary for anyone who is following the series. That said, it doesn't work as a novel. One wants to suggest to the author that he work from an outline, and go back to such basics as the beginning, the middle, and the end, with a discernable plot. By this 8th book of the series, he has so many irons in his fire that no one of the themes is advanced very far toward a conclusion, and tracking what each of the characters has done in the past and is doing is now has become a very complex undertaking (even for a professional historian who does this sort of thing for a living). I suggest a relational database cross-referencing characters and events from one book to another."
2,Rather Sad,"This book, in a pattern much like the latest few books, demonstrates why authors should be paid for content rather than word count. The plot could have been reduced to Rand losing it, people plotting against Rand, Perrin not accomlishing much and the girls have been doing NOTHING as they have been for the last 5 books. One notices a disturbing trend in his books, in which the action is drawn out longer and longer, with more and more irrevelant talks of Neyeve tugging on the braid and Elaine flittering about while the main characters , the tar'varen s if you will, are barely mentioned. Take the Eye of the World, read the Great Hunt, skip the third and fourth books, Read the End of the Fifth one, the very end of the Six one as well as chapters with Mat in it, and the very end of the seventh one. This one is not worth reading, except maybe the parts about the Seanchan. END"
1,Robert Jordan has lost it. This is the worst of this series,"This series started out with a superb book Wheel of time , then the next 2 where good, then three and four were so so and then Lord of Chaos was very good, Since then the last two books seem to have lost focus. Too many charecters and too many issues and subplots. Somewhere down the line Robert Jordan has lot focus. Where is Mat Couthan in this book there is no mention of him. Rand and Perrin dont do much. Only worthwhile event is Elayne getting the Sun Throne. The Break Away Aes Sedai are delaying things too long. I think its time for Jordan to get grip on the situation and save this series from a disastrous end instead just lengthening the number of books,"
1,"Sod the story, let's grab the money","Damn I'm glad I didn't buy this one. I got it from the Library, and only my dogged tenacity persuaded me to do that. I was hoping we might at last get a satisfactory finish to this series, but no. Same old characters in the the same tierd patterns of behaviour. Too many names and mounds of tedious fantasy politics. So much potential, so little pay-off. I can only assume that the Book Co. have persuaded RJ to spin it out so they can cream off the mega-bucks, and that RJ is a little tierd of the whole business, and doesn't have a clue how to finish it. Maybe I'll skim Book 9 in a shop one day, and check the last page to see if there's been any movement."
2,"Jordan is a greedy, cheating SOB.","As anyone who has been reading this series knows, each book begins with a series of short scenes from the various camps involved in the plot of this story. Book 8(this book) ends in exactly the same way (the only one which does). The jacket of book 5(TFOH) says this series is a probable 8 book series. TPOD is the shortest book in this series. All of this tells me that book 8(TPOD) was split in half so there could be a book 9. Why not? The series is so popular, people will buy book 103 if he can keep it going that long (and with the amount of nothing that happens in this one, he may be able to). In my opinion, anyone who buys book 9 is just plain dumb. Yes, I do intend to read it(I'm as hooked as most others), but this guy(greedy Jordan) is why we have libraries. The 2 stars is for past remembrances. For those who are just beginning this series, I envy you. Right up to the point where you have to wade through this one."
2,The story has been lost in the detail,"Even though the Path of Daggers might not be a great book in and of itself, the series is still pretty good on a whole. So my 2 star rating is for this book alone.I think that Robert Jordan has got caught up in a style of writing where every plot element and sub story has to be presented to the reader in extreme detail. How huge is this cast of characters going to be before the series is over? Robert Jorden needs to focus a bit more on the primary characters.Has anyone noticed that Nynaeve's personality has now reached such extremes that she seems to be going insane! And does every women who channels have to stare at each other with ""eyes like daggers"" Give me a break. How often do we have to see the female characters in the this novel argue."
4,Like vintage wine,"if you whiners bother to reread the whole series, you'd find that POD continues the pace Mr Jordan set at the start of the series. he's even started tying all the threads of the story and gave some hints as to the future of the series. AND THAT IS: the wheel of time is meant to be savored like great vintage wine....slowly to the last enjoyable drop."
2,Patience is a virtue,"Like most of you I was disappointed with this ""work"". I have spent countless hours reading this storyline only to watch the plot advancement slow to a crawl. I am also becoming confused with the overload of minor details as well as character names and roles. The series has started to test my patience, but I still have faith. Robert Jordan has provided me with MANY hours of enjoyable reading that I am truely thankful. I am not going to turn on him now and I will see this series through. Although I think that Mr. Jordan needs to realize that the patience and loyalty of his readers are not never-ending resources. Keep your fingers crossed for book 9."
2,This book is like your sophmore year....,"It's right in the middle and completely forgettable. I really enjoy this series but boy it's dragging. Nothing monumental happens here, and there is NO information on Mat ( same thing happened with Perrin in a previous installment, errrr). I had actually re-read all the books and vowed to NOT read this until the series was finished. I ordered the book and left it in it's mailing box for months, then had to take a cross country flight and took it along. My advise to anyone out there who is into the series is to wait until the NEXT book comes out then read them both at once, you add to the chances of something substantial happening to move the gang along. One question before I go - What is the DEAL with the women in this series? They are so annoying it's getting hard to care what happens to any of them (except maybe Min). I hope they actually get fleshed out and more believable going forward."
2,Bored,"This book took much too long to produce and with very little to show for it. The first half of the book was too bogged down in relating details about the dress and mannerisms of the characters. I was literally bored. The writing was disjointed and frankly difficult to follow at times. This series needs a significant shot in the arm in order for me to take any time to read further. If anyone wants a good exciting read try Terry Goodkind or ""The Runelords"" by David Farland. I wont continue to read this series until Robert Jordan figures out where he's going with it."
1,Lost and adrift.,"The Wheel of Time has become the Death March of Time. Calling recent offerings ponderous is kind. I am forced to take notes as I read this book in an attempt to keep track of all the characters and plots. I find the writing repetitive and dull. As others have noted, how many times can you tolerate scenes of Nynaeve pulling on her braid. I long for the writing of the early books where there were fewer story lines, faster paced plots and characters that you could like. Unless he refocuses, the author deserves to see a dwindling reader base for this series."
2,Disappointing,"What there was of the story was very good. But where is the rest? Events barely advanced. True, Elayne made it to Caemlyn, the Bowl of the Winds was used, the Seachan were engaged, ect. But the overall story was lacking. Over 500 pages just to advance a few events? Hardly worth the hardback price. I will wait until the series is finished and purchase the remaining books in paperback. I think Mr. Jordan is milking a cash-cow."
1,Big dissapointment,"I gave this book 1 star because it is a far cry from the other books in the series. The plot barely moved. The battle in the mountains was disappointing because Jordan did not place the reader in the battle. Instead, he hid the fight behind trees. The story resembled a soap opera more than anything else. Bye the way, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE PATH OF DAGGERS? That misleading title was the biggest disappointment. The time I waited for this book to come out was the biggest waste of time. Jordan should have taken more time. I would rather wait longer and get better quality. The book stunk. Pee-yew. p.s. What about Matt?"
4,"slower, but another step forward","This isn't as ""can't put it down"" as previous titles in the series but we must remember that the WHEEL OF TIME series is a very involved story. The fact that this particular book isn't as fast paced as the earlier titles doesn't detract from the depth it has added to the story overall. I'll definitely be lining up for the next edition!!"
2,"Engaging, but oh so slow...","The WOT series really could have been one of the best--a true classic, if only RJ had settled on, say, six books instead of twelve. The plot started losing momentum after book four, and is REALLY slowing down now. As much as I enjoy the characters and the world RJ has created, I'm more than a little frustrated with the ever-slowing pace of the story. Not much happens in POD to push the plot along. Hooked as I am, I won't quit now, but I'm not certain I'd recommend the series to someone else at this point--at least not as wholeheartedly as I used to. Perhaps the final three books will change my mind, but nothing short of a serious abridgement will return WOT to ""classic"" status. Too bad."
2,slow and uninteresting,"the first books where very good, the last few have gone downhill quickly i think mr.jordan is drawing the series out for money reasons"
2,The plot does not seem to be going anywhere,"I have read all the Wheel of Time books now and have found them entertaining reading up to number seven (Crown of Swords), However it now seems as if the series is never going to end.There are a lot of loose ends hanging around and it looks sa if it will take a further three books to tie them up.L Ron Hubbard also wrote a a ten book series (Mission Earth) and the last three where an agony to read. I hope Robert Jordan is not going to put us through the same pain.In this book we get to see the main character way to little and it seems as if he(Rand Al Thor)is stagnating. In the first few books everything happened at a fast pace now it just seems to drag along.I would love it if the author could rap this series up."
1,Booorrrinnnggggg......,Time to wrap up the series Bob. Your main characters are getting stale and the ones you are introducing are lame. The plot is too long and again very boring. I love long stories but this is ridiculous. Lets bring it to a close huh? If I could give this no stars I would. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
3,A faster read for me than others,"I agree with much of the criticism running throughout these reviews. In particular, I find much of the backgrounding to be both excessive and repetitive. (How does knowing the weave, embroidery and style of every minor character's outfit move the plot forward? Also, I think I have figured out that the Aiel wear cadin'sor and have shoufa draped around their necks.) Additionally, I have such a hard time keeping track of all the lackeys around Rand that I sometimes give up trying. Finally, I find the pull of the series weakening when the characters all seem to possess unimaginable powers. (I still like Mat though - Let's get him back to center stage!) Nevertheless, I certainly appreciate the sheer breadth of this story and enjoy each new twist in the plot. Waiting for #9."
2,All I can say is WTF.,"I have been reading the WOT books from when they started and its been 9 years now. I still love the books and yes I will buy the next one. But I also buy trash novels because I am hooked on them. I dont want to think of the WOT as trash novels but a 2 year wait for this!!!!!! Meanwhile having to subsist on is mediocre Fallon books. What are you doing to us Robert Jordan? I am a majorly disapointed fan. Maybe a I year wait I could take, but no, you have to do less interesting books and make all of your fans wait. In closing I would like to say that this book traveled nowhere."
3,"God, this is so unfair!!!!","I waited two years for another Lord of Chaos or Fires of Heaven. Jordan, (while still writing with his normal flare and signature) lowered his plotting in this one. From the Eye to the Crown he weaved the richest web ever and now . . . well, let's just say he dissapointed me a tad bit. I guess we'll just have to wait ANTOHER two years to see how the next one'll turn out.I'd love to see TOR start publishing Jordan's book more frequently, I hate to think that when a book like this comes out I'll have to wait two years to be assuaged."
2,"Lost, and wandering in circles.","With Path of Daggers the last in the list of titles for a very long time, I thought that this would be the climax. I think the author is lost, and wandering in circles. Major disappointment!"
1,the WORST book in the series,"I am a die hard Robert Jordan fan. I have purchased all of his books, including the books written under pseudonyms. What he wrote in this book could have been accomplished in 4 chapters minus all the rubbish. The story was not advanced, just cluttered. I waited for 2 years anticipating each move in the story only to be severely disappointed. I sincerely hope the next book is not a contract book and has more meat on its pages."
1,And the next installment will be out when?,"I've had a few favorite storylines in the past that led to disappointment because the author died without finishing a series of books, but this is the first time I've become worried that **I'll** die of old age before a series gets finished. As good as this series has been, each additional book seems to introduce more plot lines than it resolves, seems to cover a shorter and shorter slice of storyline time, spends more pages re-hashing old details, and uses entirely too much paper and ink in an endless character costume fashion show. Convoluted plot lines are fun to untangle, but not when you need an encyclopedia just to keep track of who's who -- for the (inevitable) next book I challenge Jordan and his publisher to include just a single line in the glossary for *every* named character who has appeared in this series. I'm just glad I borrowed the book to read it."
2,"Too much filler, not enough substance","I began reading the WOT series shortly after it came out and was thoroughly hooked. Great story lines, fascinating characters, and a lot of action. Now I'm bored reading his books. The last two or three entries have done nothing but ramble. It's time for Jordan to put some substance back into this series and wrap it up. Stop milking the cash cow and get on with the final battle. Path of Daggers did absolutely nothing. Where's Mat? What the hell happened with the Seachan? All of a sudden that story line ended with some guy crying. Jordan needs to wrap this series up. For those of you writing great reviews I have to disagree."
1,Utter Crap,"I sort of expected this after the last book, but even I couldn't believe the depths to which Jordan has fallen in this book. Utter crap doesn't begin to describe the tripe that is contained in these 900 or so pages. Out of consideration for his readers Jordan should finish off with the series before he completely decimates an initially interesting series. This last book has shown that Jordan doesn't even belong in the same universe as J.R.R. Tolkien. Even a single star is charity in this case."
3,2 YEARS???,"On finally getting a hold of this book, i was initially disappointed it was under-sized. I came to the conclusion the book was more to the point and not so excessive with repetitive character/enviroment discriptions. However, on finishing the book I was disapointed. The book NEEDED those xtra 300 or so pages to wrap up loose story lines. Think on the lack of any real action out Perrins way. Then again, I think this book was beter than aCoS in that it was action packed. I especially enjoyed the scenes with Elayne and Nynaeve, dispite Nynaeves apparent lack of 'growth' after losing her block in aCoS, she acted the fool more often than not, and that every-second-line braid pulling has got to stop. Otherwise the book had some very inrteresting developments among ashaman and the shadow. I only wish that less paper could be wasted discribing 'fire and ice' and more time spent unifying nations at a quicker pace, so that Tarmon Gaidon may begin."
1,"No end of this "" Wheel of time"" series in a lifetime","TWO YEARS of waiting for this book! Nothing really happens, the story is completely at a stand still. With this pace, it will take at least eight more books befor all loose ends are coming together. And why all these long descriptions of matters of no importance for the story,(like what the surroundings look like, what thoughts about nothing are filling somebodys head) while nothing ever happens. I do not think there ever will be an end, ""Tarmon Gaidon"" or not, to this once promising story. I will not buy book nine if it ever comes, if I will have to vait more than a year. And I will read the critics first."
1,"Unfortunately, a boring continuation of volume 7.","The Path Of Daggers is definitely a continuation from volume 7, but I get the distinct impression that the storyline has become jumbled and a bit lost. It almost seems that Mr. Jordan was forced to crank out this book under some sort of deadline, making the storyline disjointed and somewhat incomplete in its furthering of the cycle. Very unlike the first 5 books, which were engaging and well-paced. I'm helplessly addicted, but that doesn't prevent my disappointment at this volume. I'd rather wait the extra time to have a more engrossing read. Thanks."
4,"The book was intriguing, but hardly worth the wait .","Rand wasn't mentioned until half way through the book and Matt wasn't even mentioned at all. The book did give some more clues however and at least the on-coming war with the White Tower is getting closer. On the whole, the book was very well written and the plot keeps getting thicker. It's a ten book series and I'm sure that the next two books will be very much worth the wait. Thanks to Robert Jordan, I have a constant read. I just keep rereading the series over and over again."
2,ABOUT TIME HE FINISHED.,"I like the wheel of time series but is'nt it time he wrapped it up ,the story and character's are great and imageinitive still after eight books it is geting slightly long winded.Jordan is just trying to milk money out of it, and fair juice to him but the dragon rebon [rand al'thor], should decide which he loves most or decide to live with all of them except elayne 'cause she gets up my nose but all in all; good book but long winded!!!!"
2,Jordan please come back,Its amazing I've read everything else in the series just because of how good it is 11 times each and now I only read it 1 because I wanted to hear from matBut it seems Jordon has let money go to his head and is going to extend it on till he retires and if Jordon does this thing again with the next book as he did with PoD then I will just wait till they apear in paperback or read it in the library if they find it worthwhile to carry them...... Pleas let Jordon slap himself and get working I gave it the 2nd star on loan from his previous books and ... Future novels..... please?...
2,"Jordan, FINISH IT!!!!!!","The first book was fantastic, the rest were good. After having read all of the books, I would no longer recomend this series to a fellow reader; 3000+ pages of reading could be better spent elsewhere and at least you might get CLOSURE!"
2,Like swampy Florida,"Hi I am a devoted fan of Robert Jordan since 1994 nontheless I started reading The Wheel of Time until last may. I devoured the first four books..book five turned out to be very hard and slow .books six and seven turned out to be better..but the eight one really disappointed me..SWAMPY FLORIDA could not wait to finish it and I am afraid Jordan is just making profit out of us all fans by following the Stephen King s recepie of ""one novel a day"" and its not thinking of a blasting comeback...I remember the gripping 1st book..I could not put it down! Now..I dont know if this is ever going to end..hope it does, in an excelent and satisfying conclusion."
3,He's losing grasp of the storylines.,This book is one of the weakest of the series. Jordan does not really advance any of the storylines. Even the Seanchan are barely in the book. We aren't any closer to ending this series. Jordan is now milking us for all of our money in that if we have read 8 books he knows we'll stick with it till the bitter end. I'm not so sure.
3,Jordan seems to be losing his balance,"One of the greates things about the WoT series has always been its superb balance if plot and action. PoD diverges from this sharply, it seems to be more of a setup book than anything else, the only problem with this is that when you have to wait a year or longer for each book, a slow methodical plot is less than satysfying. I have seen alot of comments about Mat's dissapearance, about that I just want to remind all of the WoT readers that the same thing happened to Perrin for a couple of books and he came back with a vengance"
2,I was waiting for this?,"I don't mind the wait between books if it is justified. This one was not. There are some out there that say to be patient, but that is not why I fell in love with this series. The first books in this series were awesome: the plot moved, there was fast-paced action, developed characters, and great battle & political descriptions. Where did it go? I hope he gets back on track for the next one, or I won't be waiting for 'The Last Battle'."
2,WARNING: This book contains dangerous amounts of drivel,There is nothing I can really add to what has already been said about this shockingly horrible book. Ditto to every scathing review and I swear this book should have a warning label......
3,Better Than Most But Compared to Other WoT It Falls Short,"Everyone's a critic these days. Sure Path of Daggers was not near as good as RJ's previous WoT novels but it surpasses the majority of fantasy books I have read (and believe me, I have read LOTS of fantasy books). There are a number of things RJ could have done differently. For instance, Mat was barely mentioned and I was especially looking forward to reading about him. Also, Jordan has enough loose ends and storylines that the book could have been at least 600 pages longer than it was. However, Daggers was well written and as I said it was better than the majority of fantasy that is out there. For those of you who are becoming disenchanted, just wait, things will get better. Remember, the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills."
5,HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN.,"you wil not be disapointed. ""The Path of Daggers"" is a true Robert Jordan. it captures you, thrilles you, and in the end leaves you longing for a sequel. when i finaly got ""The Path of Daggers"" (i had been waiting forever it seemed), i found the book to be impressive no doubt about that. But it is a teaser. You are caught up in the intrigues, and battels, and suddenly and without warning the book ends. It has a tremendous litteray effekt, but i want to know the end of the story. As the lack of a nr. 9 is the onley criticisem i have got towards ""The Wheel Of Time"" i can warmly recomend the books."
3,POD is a sorry addition to the series,"Believe it or not, i actually had to FORCE myself to go through book 8 in detail so i would not lose the plot...it was THAT boring....thought Mr Jordan made me wait to sorry years for it, i will forgive him cos of the 7 worthy journeys he has taken me on before..i will keep continuing waiting for his books (not too long i hope) i do hope it won't turn out like Book 8...it is too long for Mat to disappear totally in one book..and why is Min acting more and more like a whining bimbo who DOES answer at every beck and call of Rand's? i truly like her in comparison to ELayne and Aviendha..but pls give her some dignity and pride...all in all i do hope MR Jordan does not tire in his continuation of his series and loses ihs magic in weaving out his webs of fantasy.and i know its hard..but pls hurry.:)...."
2,Get on with it,"The Path of Daggers bears no relationship to the derivation of its name and bears little resemblance to the rest of the series. Nothing is resolved, little takes place and the progress of the story, slowed already in LoC and ACoS, grinds nearly to a halt. There is a difference between crafting a good story and telling one. Jordan has crossed the line dividing the two and the series is floating rudderless at this point. Get to it, Mr. Jordan, and move things to a greater resolution. Given the disappointing finishes to numerous ""Doorstopper"" fantasy series (the Malloreon, Death Gate cycle, Memory-Sorrow-Thorn) the likelihood that the promise of the first 4-5 books can be reached by the end of the series decreases with each unnecessary page."
3,Less and less,"While the little that did happen here was okay, there wasn't much. However, it does set up the next book for something exciting, and if something doesn't happen in #9, I think a lot of people will be disappointed. Also, what was Mat doing during all of this, surely something had to have happened in Ebou Dar."
2,Boring,"Nothing happens during the entire book. Some of the main characters hardly appear for more than a brief chapter or so. Save yourself a week's trouble and get a friend to tell you the little that happens, then wait for the next one. A MAJOR letdown after waiting several years since the last volume."
2,"Disappointed, but hooked..","I read the first book, Eye of the World, when first released. I was hooked. I have loved every book since then... except for Path of Daggers. I waited and waited for its release and the disappointment was crushing. Where was the intrigue, the sense of mystery? Why write this filler book? My advice to Mr. Jordan is to finish the series, give up the money he makes by waiting to release a book (hoping we will convince our friends to begin the series), and salvage his place in literary history. I no longer respect the work, but as I said, I'm hooked. I'll buy the rest."
3,Dull Dull Dull,"This book was very DULL, what happened to the story line? He put too much time on the damn women,and where was Matt? Rand fights Dashva(spelling) whats with that? this book just went down a twisted path! Too much talk and no action. I hope the next one is better!!!!!!!!"
1,This is an unbelievably bad book,"Let's face it, this series is dead, let's put a bullet in it. I have been a loyal Wheel of Time reader for close to 7 years now and all I can say is that it really does seem as if this author is writing just to make money now. There is no doubt in my mind that the last 2 books could have been combined as so little happens in each book. That would be bad enough but it also seems as if the characters are becoming very two dimensional. Try to figure out who I am describing, she is petty, vain and in competition with every woman in the book. That's right, you guessed it, I have described every female character in the last book. It makes me so angry that I can't write because I'm too busy putting my fists on my hips! This book is a sad testimony to money driven publishing, I feel like I wasted part of my life by reading it."
1,Disapointed,"I became a Wheel of Time junkie years ago and have eagerly awaited each new volume. Unfortunately (since vol. 6) Robert Jordan has progressively lost the edge. I will most likely read his books until the finale, but I'll wait and get it from the library. I don't feel he is earning the money like he is capable of doing. I am disapointed in the quality of his work as of late...hopefully the trend will stop with this last episode."
4,It was good... but it was a little slow.,"I think that the book was good, but it still leaves us with the question ""What in the world happened to Mat?!"" Jordan didn't even mention his name more than a couple times.The book was still good though, and I liked the ending. It leaves you wanting to read about Rand and Elayne's coming reunion. I can't wait!!!!!!"
2,Teeth grindingly slow,"Time is compressing horribly in the most recent book. The incident with nynaeve and friends trying to escape from Ebou Dar was so detailed it made me want to scream in frustration. A great writer, but get on with it. Also the story is getting too complicated, unless all the books are reread it is impossible to keep up. Another side effect of this is that so many plots are running in parallel that many of them don't even get mentioned in a whole book. This means it could be up to 2 years before a plot resumes. Turgid and disappointing, time for Mr Jordan to relearn all he has forgotten about narrative pace. Still a fan but I'm getting shaky."
3,Not as Good as Past Books,I had been waiting for over a year since the last book which was pretty good. The latest Jordan book was a little disappointing. I feel the author did a lot of stretching with unnecessary detail. I would have prefered more action between the Dragon Reborn and the bad guys magical or military would have suited me.
3,3.5 Stars: A Decent Continuation of The Wheel of Time,"I was just a little dissappointed with Robert Jordan's latest. It is as good as books six and seven, but it simply isn't as exciting as the first five books. I don't mind the extensive use of detail that Jordan uses to paint a picture of his fantasy world, but I would really appreciate it if he included a few more scenes of action. The chapter ""A Time for Iron"" is absolutely wonderful, one of the most exciting chapters in the entire series."
2,author must have taken a vacation on book 8,"I am a big fan of The Wheel of Time Series. But, was very disappointed with The Path of Daggers. All of the planning in the 7 previous volumes have gone to waste in volume 8. It seems Robert Jordan took a vacation while writing book 8. Hey Robert: Please read your first 7 books of the series and let's get back to the good stuff!!!!"
4,"Over all a very good book, but didn't resolve what I'd hoped",Path of Daggers was a great read and well worth the cost of a hardcover. It continues the excellent character development that a Robert Jordan fan has come to expect from his stories. The only disappointment experienced was that many of the issues that I expected that Mr. Jordan would resolve were not.
1,Nothing Happens,"Nothing happens in this book. The plot development could have been reduced to one chapter. Jordan introduced no new conflicts, resolved no old issues, and did not developany of the characters. Becides being a good diversion, this book was a waste of Jordan's energy. He accomplished nothing and seems to be floundering. Get back on track."
4,WIll I live to see this finished???,"I've been a fan since the start - breath-taking adventure, panoramic visions of a world not our own, promises of the battle to end all battles. But I'm 25 now - and starting to doubt the likelihood of me living to the end of the series (much less actually working through all the sub-plots and figuring out who the hell killed Asmodean).Although it's a joy to read a series I know will keep me spellbound, I need some answers!!!! Path of Daggers didn't supply any. Do I seriously have to wait another 2 years to hopefully gain a few more crumbs?Please, PLEASE give me something substantial. Is Verin Black Ajah?!?!?!?"
1,Be sure to drink your Ovaltine!,"After reading this book, I couldn't help but feel a little like Ralphie, in the movie ""A Christmas Story"". After waiting months to get my secret decoder ring, all I got was a ""crummy commercial"". Be sure to read book nine!"
4,Path of Daggers,"Yes, we've heard the same things over and over again. I thought the plot was fine, though slow-moving. But my least favorite part of the book by far was the Glossary. In future editions I hope Jordan will consider making a list of names in the Glossary. I can't remember 50 characters from a book I read 2 years ago. Just a little reminder would be good enough. I mean, why is Padan Fain in the Glossary? What makes him better than Moridin, for example? I didn't even know Moridin had been in book 7 until I read something on the Internet about it. I am eagerly awaiting the next book, however."
3,almost not worth the wait,"after waiting as long as we did for the latest book in the wot series, i was less than totally satisfied. mat was nowhere to be seen, and not much happened. of course it was still good reading, but i hope the next book arrives sooner, and is more action packed."
1,Nothing Happens,"It was a great seris until things drug to a halt in book 7 and nothing happens in this book. It is so borring Jordan does not even mention Matt. Make something happen Jordan. Move the plot somewhere, PLEASE."
4,Wheel of Time Bk. 8,"Keeps moving along in the series. Jumped around a bit, as all the books do, just seemed like more. Enjoy the level of suspense and author doesn't seem to reiterate prior character information too much."
3,Needs to study real people,"He doesn't know how real people operate. Every woman is hard-headed and uber-assertive, and in real life, people vary. Otherwise, it's a good book. (According to my 15 year old son.)"
4,Far better than I remembered it,"I think reading these books following quickly one after the other has drastically improved my opinion of some of the volumes I liked the least when I read them before. This book was *far* better than I remembered it, and for the first time in any WoT book, it brought tears to my eyes. I understand the 2 star reviews, and mine would have been one of them a few years ago, but not any more."
3,Anyone else feel that something's missing?,"The first time I read PoD I was somewhat furious. I just read it for a second time a couple weeks ago (tried to let time heal the wounds and scars from the first reading). The second time around, the book wasn't as bad (maybe b/c of the lack of the anticipation, etc). This installment of the series is yet again another plot builder. Teasing you of things to come, introducing new situations etc. All I have to say is: Where's Mat! When is the ""Blue Lady"" coming back? Better yet when are Thom, Olver, and Mat gonna rescue her?"
2,Please don't milk this series for money and ruin it any more,"I was truly disappointed with how incredibly boring and uninspiring this book was. This was the book I left next to the toilet in case of long sessions... I was very excited to get this book, yet it was so anti-climactic that I was disenchanted with the whole series. If the next book is this gruelling and pathetic, I will have to stop investing in Mr. Jordan's writing career. So sad to see such excellent talent wasted in what appears to be a book made to fill contractual obligations to publishers, not true inspiration."
3,"Good, but will it ever end?",I enjoyed this book as I have all in the series. But not for the first time I found myself wondering if it was ever going to end. While I enjoy the story I feel a lack of closure!!! Frankly I am tired of reading books in this series with no payoff. I'm tired of waiting for something to happen. I think I will wait for the series ends before I pick up the 9th.
3,Ok but not the best.,"OK I know this wasn't the best one, it was sooooo slow but what about the first 100 or so pages in book one. It's the same build up, he did take a whole book this time though but I would leave any major actions. . . like quiting the series until after the next book. But I for one will be there until Jordan's sons finsh it(after hes dies of old age)."
3,"Good writing, yet getting old",POD is expertly written yet as we reach the end of the eigth book it seems that no ones making any real progress.I am reminded much of Terry Goodkin. His first 3 books were great but 4 and 5 seem a redundant. I would really like to get to the climax of what has so far been an expertly told story.
2,Nothing new or imaginative and it drags to make jordan money,"I cant believe I anticipated reading this book. I find the Wheel of Time series, origonally to be 8 books, now stretched to 24 books, about as unfullfilling as they come. The story never takes off. Nothing left unanswered in the previous book is really answered in this one. I do not keep track of 200 different characters, not because I cannot, but because so few of their stories are interesting. I enjoyed reading about 15 minutes of this book, and I loved the series. THIS BOOK IS A BIG LET DOWN. Do I have to read a book for every country Rand takes? What a bore..."
2,What a let down!,"I had been anxiously awaiting the arrival of PoD since about a month after CoS was released. I was less than impressed with CoS but figured that it was just a fluke. I was wrong. The best thing I can say about PoD is that there was a fair amount of resolution. Although, on that same note, the resolutions that do occur seem hollow and anticlimactic. The Wheel of Time remains by far the best SF/Fantasy epic I have ever read. In hopes that Mr. Jordan gets back on track, I will once again wait for the next installment."
2,no resolution,"I have found the Wheel of Time to be one of the best fantasy series I have ever read. However, I am somewhat disappointed with this latest offering. While I recognize that sometimes it is necessary to sacrifice some action in order to properly ""set the stage"" so to speak, I found the absence of virtually any resolution to any plot line disheartening. It is clear to me that the next book could be the best in the series, as Jordan has set several of the plot lines up to climax. However, I believe he should have spread out the plot resolutions better between the books."
3,A little too long...,"The first five books of this series were interesting enough, but the last three my interest is begining to wear thin. The Path of Daggers was not what I had expected...In fact I had to force myself to complete this book. Mr. Jordan is extending this series beyond its appeal to the readers. I found this rather sad because I really had enjoyed this series until now. The plot has become tedious and boring. I think this story should be finished....SOON!"
2,"Please,Please, Please get back to the plot","Please Mr.Jordan take all this criticism as a plea to return to the story we all loved. The last two books have been a very slow crawl to nowhere, or so it seems at this point."
2,This book does not stand on its own merit.,"Sorry folks---the main problem with PoD is not the missing characters, the overly complicated plot or the late introduction of new themes. It is simply that this book cannot stand on its own the way the first 4-5 books of the series could. Path of Daggers continues a trend, generally down, in the quality of the entertainment. True, Mr. Goodkind can write whatever and however he pleases. The same is true of his readers and reveiwers.The final word: I am lending out my copy of Path of Daggers to anyone I know bored enough to read it. Don't buy it!"
2,Sigh...Now I'm depressed,"It all began so well, with the first book, The Eye of the World. It got better, and it climaxed somewhere between book three and four. Then it got worse. By the eighth installment (too many books!) of this series, the main character is so powerful there is hardly any adventure anymore; the peasant-boy-discovering-his-magical-abilities plot was more exciting somehow than the sorcerer-king-gone-mad. If you haven't started reading this series already, then don't bother beginning."
2,"R.J.,GET ON WITH IT !","This is without a doubt the low point for this series.I understand the desire to cash in on a good thing but to be this blatant about it is an insult to the reader.What makes it worse is the unbelievably long wait we had to suffer through and this is what we get?!?! The pace of the series has been slowing progressively since the first few books and with POD it comes to a virtual halt. Plot development was almost non-existent,rather the story meanders about and like the characters ends up getting nowhere."
1,Drivel,"The sad tale of the demise of the WOT series is a great literary tradgedy. Everything seems to be moving backwards. The pace is decelerating, the focus is blurring, and the characters have evolved from complex people to cardboard cutouts with one-note personalities. What on earth has happened here?I really believe that RJ has a deep-seated dislike of women. He has made all of his female characters so immature, annoying, and controlling that it is impossible not to side with the ""boys."" I think that's very deliberate. Even Min, my former favorite character, somehow lost all the personality characteristics that made her distinct from the other three (and therefore tolerable). How depressing.I'm not sure that I can stand to read any more of this drivel. I feel so ... used."
2,What happened to the story?,"If you leave out the parts where RJ is describing the hills, trees, well known characters, castles and all other unimportant or well known facts (he seems to have forgotten that we read 7 books so far, and know everything about everybody important) you end up with nothingIf you just read what's on the cover and add Min having a great sex life with Rand - you have read the book.Of course I will continue to buy the WoT books like most of the others, but I won't recommend it to any friend of mine. If you are thinking about starting now - DON'T! Better wait for RJ to finish the series, read the reviews and than decide.Dear Mr. Jordan, if you ever read this, please don't let us down next time."
1,I want my money back,"what started out as a promising series has turned into a money-making scam. the books have become progressively more empty and boring. a golf match has more action than this book. this will be the first series i won't get through, because i've totally lost interest in it. i dont plan on wasting money on 4 or 5 more books that probably still remain in this wreck of a series, and you shouldn't either. the book does have one useful quality, though: it's a great cure for insomnia."
5,BRING IT ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been reading the online reveiws and a lot of people are complaining. To those people who rated this book a two or less, I have a question to ask you. Why didn't you just put the book down if it was that ***damn awful?! But I'm not here to criticize other people's opinions, I'm here to tell Mr.Jordan that he wrote a very good book and he should write more if his heart intends.I personally loved the WOT series and will not stop reading it until it is truly over. Mr.Jordan, if you are reading this I want to tell you that I am an avid reader of your books and appreciate what you give to your fans; a book worth reading.Only one problem with the book. Mat. Mat is my most fave character, but he was barely mentioned. But it's all part of the masterplan. =)Thanks Mr.Jordan C.D."
2,Not up to par.,"As a reader who anxiously counted the days and hours until the release of POD and who has read the previous 7 book multiple times I must admit my dissappointment with the quality of Jordan's lateset work. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I firmly believe that this book could have been shortened by half. It was very dissapointing and gave the impression of running in place. I only have two questions. Did you rush this book to make a buck? What happened to Mat?"
3,"Oy, get on with it!","Never before have I read a book so large with so little forward action or information! Don't get me wrong, I AM enjoying the series. But this story should have been finished at least 3 books ago. My advice, wait for the paperback."
3,Lets get moving!,"Three stars overall, 1 1/2 stars compared to the rest of the series...Lets face it, this is like waiting for Christmas. You want to know what you're going to get, but then it'll be over. You come away from book eight thinking; a) I hope we dont have to wait another two years, and b) the next volume better be twice as long, and actually resolve some plot points. I miss Mat. Perrin's story was one chapter long. Mr. Jordan, you captured our imagination. Now stop teasing and get on with it."
1,Half of a book,"Reading this book felt like some publishing executive took Jordan's latest work and said, ""this is just too big for a novel, but don't condense it, add more words and we'll make two books from it."" When I got to the last page, it felt like I had just read the first half of a very padded book and that there should have been at least another 500 pages of storyline. The book barely keeps the overall plot ticking over and nothing of any real consequence happens other than to provide extra threads for the series to follow over the next ten or fifteen books. I would suspect that a person could read the series up to this one, skip this one and not lose their place in the story at all. All in all, a big disappointment from what is otherwise a very enjoyable series of books."
1,Sell out!,"I rushed to buy this book with millions of other fans, and was highly disapointed. It looks like Jordan just realized that he could make more money if he prolonged the series forever. Of course the publishers have no problem with this philosophy. Mainly I am giving a review because the overall rating here at Amazon.com was too high."
1,Show me the money!,"I had my suspicions after the last poorly drafted WOT book, but this pathetic storyline cinched it. Robert Jordan is in it for the money folks! This book had at least 800 pages of pure fluff. Guess how many times the leader of the knitting circle gave people a stern look and they quivered. If you guessed less than 100, you aren't even in the ballpark. These books have no drama because Jordan is extending the story with claptrap to drag out the WOT and provide additional dinero. I have two regrets: 1) I encouraged him to continue milking his fans by buying this Path of Dull Daggars; 2) This site doesn't allow a zero star review which this book deserves. I will never buy another Jordan book again. Do NOT buy this book!"
2,A Let Down,"Jordan has delivered in the past.But my jaw dropped at the let down in this book. Looks like they are just trying to soak the series for extra money. Jordan began incredibly well, but really dropped the ball with Path of Daggers. It read flat and linear. I hope 9 is better, but if it took 2 years to write this, I'm not holding my breath.I actually went out and bought 2 copies of vol 1 for some friends before finishing this one. After finishing it, I wouldn't have.If the book were alone and not part of a great epic, I would have given it 1 star. So Path of Daggers gets 1 star, and an extra +1 pity star because the other books were good."
1,Wow! This book Stunk!,"After book 7, I wrote a review telling everyone to lighten up, Book 7 was obviously being used to set up the ending of the story and Books 8 onward would be high paced epics like 1 through 6. Man was I wrong! Book 8 stunk, it went nowhere slowly. For those of you who haven't bought it yet, wait for the paperback or skip it completely."
4,My favorite story of all time....though,"This is without a doubt the best story ever written. The Wheel of Time has kept me up many night and I know it will continue to do so. To all the people complaining that the PoD is only a filler, I agree with you. But when you say it is unnecessary I disagree, and I know no matter what you say you'll pick up the next book as quickly as I would. I never wanted to become addicted to anything...but there are for worse things to be addicted to. I recommend this series to any and everyone. Am upset that Mat wasn't in this though."
1,A Waste of time,"The series title should be change from ""THE WHEELS OF TIMES"" to ""A WASTE OF TIME"" geezz... what happened MR Jordan ?? ... I have been a fan of your series for so long but this book is a JOKE! ... Lucky I didn't buy it this time and waste my money... Oh well, enough said. Bye"
2,"Needs ""The Princess Bride"" Treatment",Here's the plan: After Robert Jordan dies someone will extract the good parts from the sea of wasted words. The result would be a 5 star 1500 page epic rather than an unreadable 4000+ page morass.
4,"The book was good but man, how slow.","The serie is good, no doubt. The male characters are good, no doubt. The story is good, no doubt. No doubt about it, these aspects are great. But I do suspect that Mr. Jordan's wife has a hand in the serie and not for the good of the books. The women are all a bunch of super-models with a great intelligence and a dominant mind and all have handsome, powerfull men. Imagine professor Cameron Diaz with a Magnum 45. shooting the crap out of hordes of Chinese while french-kissing superman Leonardo DiCaprio. This is the weakest point in the book and this point is made very clear throughout the book, how iritating. Furthermore, I would like it if Mr. Jordan would hurry up, the animo is slowly running low. But I can wait a little longer."
2,Get a move on!,"In a word, this book was frustrating. The author has too many story lines going, so progress on any of them is almost imperceptible. It is imperative that this story get more focus and start moving toward a conclusion. There were some interesting bits, but to return to the greatness of the past volumes the author will have to fold some of the story lines together into a main thrust."
3,Not as good as the first 3 books - but necessary if...,"...you have read all the previous books and want to find out what happens next.Negatives:Too many redundant descriptions of characters we already know.Not enough on more popular characters.Positives:Fans of earlier works (like me) want to see what happens in the story.Summary:Sadly the author seems obsessed with long descriptions of the setting, and for some reason the entire plot has slowed down significantly from earlier works.It is almost as if the publisher has told the author to drag out the series to more books than the author intended. So the author has to come up with more verbose methods to set up a scene."
3,Let's Move Along,"OK, I like the book, but it's dragging along a bit now and I found myself skimming over areas to get on with the story. This last one was the most difficult to get through probably because there are getting to be so many main characters to keep track of. I found myself having to stop and try and remember who was who and good or bad. Many names so close that they are confusing. I'm ready for RJ to finish this series and move on to a new one, and I also agree with another writer who said the time between books is too lengthy."
1,Not he best,"I didn't like anything about it. It felt like I was listening to a story with to many holes. It was long time ago that I listened to this one, but it was so chopped up."
2,What just happened?,I picked up the series less than a year ago and finished book 8 a month ago and I can not even remember what of significance happened in the path of daggers. It must of been a challenge to fit a chapters worth of information through-out 100's of pages.I stand watch at night sometimes from midnight to 4 am and the book did keep me awake so it can't be all that bad it does keep you busy.
5,The Best {:^),"WOT is the best. It's that simple. Nowhere else have I seen and read such a realistic, enthralling, and just plain great series. As for those who think Tolkien is better, think again. Tolkien is gloomy, dark, only develops a few of his charictors, and has no female charitors. In the hobbit, it's almost as though he plays 'eenie meenie minie moe' over which dwarf says what. WOT RULES!!"
1,I just don't care anymore,"Like so many others, I got totally caught up in the series with the first four books. I struggled throught books five and six and never really made it throught book seven. I was hoping this installment would get me interested again, but alas, Jordan seems to be more intent on bring in the bucks than winding up this story. I'm tired...and there are so many other books to read. Mr. Jordan, I'm sorry but I just can NOT continue to follow this endless, boring tale. Good luck with your life and now I'll get on with mine."
1,Very Bad,"Listen folks, just because a series is great (or in my opinon, WAS great) does not mean that this particular book is great. Almost all of the reviews that gave this book 4 or 5 stars did so because they said that the series is great. Then they go on making excuses for this book.Be honest! This book was not well written. No need for excuses. No need to focus on the overall series. Hopefully future books will be better (although I have my doubts). But that is no reason to rate this particular book highly."
2,Eh...,The only reason that this novel merits two stars instead of one is because of its association with the first five books in this series. The Eye of the World through The Fires of Heaven were phenomenal! The problem is that after that everything went to hell. The plot simply imploded upon itself! Mr. Jordan should go to the Vatican and beg absolution for the enormous sin that was the last three books! After that he should put out a press release telling his fans that those books were just jokes and that he's going to release the real ones any day now. I've discussed this with my friends and we're still not convinced that Mr. Jordan is dead and fearing a loss of revenue Tor has hired a ghostwriter to keep churning the series out. By the quality of the drivel turned out I'm assuming it's Terry Goodkind...
1,useless boring story,"I found that in his eighth book, Jordan was totally losing his storyline with useless chatter and very, very boring long segments that add nothing to the plot."
1,Negative Rating,"My pet Guppie, could have written a more lively story. I was waiting for Mat, I was waiting for Rand to Kill Mazrim. Shoot I was waiting for the week to end, this whole book took place in about a week. And so many tangents, a College Geometry teacher would get lost in about two point seven seconds."
1,A Comic Book Would Be Better.,"I agree with all of the brief critisms that I've read about this book. However, I too am hopelessly enthralled with discovering how this epic series might end. It is a fun story. A wild fantasy ride. It is not good literature. The characters are poorly developed, and the plot has colapsed under the weight of its own magnitude. I am beginning to worry that Jordan cannot possibly end the series with a decent amount of closure. But we wait for the next installment, like addicts for a high. ""Tune in next year, when Rand continues to begin to go insane, and everyone else takes another step forward."" I'll be the first person in line to buy the book."
5,Robert Jordan is still the master of fantasy novels!,"A Path of Daggers is one of the best novels I have read in a while. I find his ability to keep up with so many different elements of this huge story very impressive. His character are changing in some weird ways though. What happened to the cruel, tongue-whipping Nynaeve? And why is Min so wwimpy all of a sudden? However, Perrin is becoming stronger with Berlain and Faile and he really needed to stick up for himself. I really wish there would have been more mix ups with the Forsaken in APOD too. I don't think the WOT can finish in under 12 books, but I will read every one of them!"
3,A good book but can't touch the first 7!,"This book is a good book, but it moves incredibly slow and it gets kind of annoying because the battle scenes are boring. Jordan focuses to much on Nynaeve and Elayne who are really annoying. Rand is almost crazy and they don't even mention Mat! I know the next book will be like The Great Hunt or Eye of the World because the plot demands it. Which were one of the best books I have ever read."
2,Not as good as the originals,"I have read the Wheel of Time series through Book 8. I have enjoyed the story even though it has gotten bogged down and I find it somewhat troublesome that Mr. Jordan has borrowed so liberally from other works of fantasy, most notably Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Herbert's Dune, and Donaldson's Chronicles of Thomas Covenant. The parallels between Jordan's characters and those of the other named authors are too close for comfort--Aes Sedai and Bene Gesserit, Ents and Ogiers and reluctant but determined and dedicated messiahs. Frankly, Tolkien, Herbert and Donaldson have done it better without losing sight of where the tale was going. It's time for Mr. Jordan to get to the point and complete his saga."
2,I'm getting tired,"Part of me wishes that I discovered this series when all the books were out or at least an end was in sight (if any of us live that long). Don't get me wrong, I love Jordan's work and would recommend TWOT series to anyone (as long as they have a good memory for all the characters and different adventures, situations, and especially travelling that they do, and a large store of patience for a tale that at least I see no end in sight). While POD contains its fair share of incredibly interesting and exciting events none of them gets resolved (it just keeps going and going). My biggest complaint is that once a secondary villian is defeated let him stay gone, especially when you have so many. I don't look forward to reading another 700 pages, so that a baddie that was beaten earlier can be killed again. I would like closure to some of the minor plot lines and characters at least. I'm hooked like many others, so I'll keep reading and so should you."
3,Please let it end,"When will poor Rand be allowed some peace? Path of daggers was quite a good read, but it felt like too much of the same old thing. Lets hope number nine is out soon,so I don't feel compelled to slog through itagain,just to pick up the plot."
2,Yawn.,"This is an installment only a hardcore WoT fan could love. Some other reviewers have talked about world-building and how it takes time and imagination to make a believable fantasy world, but eight books and counting is getting ridiculous. One more like this and I am going to quit this series(Really!) and re-read The Lord of the Rings to remember what a real fantasy series is all about."
4,It works,"For a storyline of this magnitude, Jordan surpasses all. Of course there will be meandering and sometimes hard to follow parts. You try writing a story like this and see how well you do. I have been reading the Wheel of Time series since the first book was ever published. I am eagerly awaiting the ninth book."
3,Read it because it's a WoT book. Not because it's good.,"I was quite disappointed by this book. After two years you'd think RJ could come up with something better than this. Too much of the story was devoted to Elayne and Egewene and even the parts about Rand weren't that good. Most noticable were the missing characters. No Mat, Gawyn, Fain, and very little follow up on the last book. What ever happened to the Shadar Logoth man? Also very little about Elaida, Logain, Perrin, and the Gholam. As with Crown of Swords, very little progress is made in the story. What ever happened to the good old days of The Shadow Rising when nearly every chapter was exciting instead of three chapters about the rebel Hall of Sitters we don't care that much about? I hope Jordan takes the next two years to think of SOMETHING interesting to take place."
2,This book really let me down!,After so long a wait I was really expecting something much better from Jordan. It seems to be a few short stories combined together. And the lack of Mat in this book is horrible since one of the first things that happens can be directly related to him... I hope that the next book doesn't focus almost entirely on him because of this. Though I believe his story may well be 10 times better then tPOD.
5,it's a great book...stop complaining,"I honestly don't know why some reviewers are so upset about this book. You know Jordan is a puzzler and likes to leave things out to make us wonder. You have to know he'll put all the pieces together for us by the end of the series. After all...he's known the last scene of the last book since the very beginning. Just relax, he'll get there.as for plot: I agree that it's a little slow..but things are picking up intensity in the plot overall. Elaine and the windfinders used the bowl of the winds...that is just awesome! I'm sure that with more books in the series things will iron themselves out.....I'm enjoying the book immensely.... the series just keeps getting better"
2,Worst book in the series. This book does not stand up.,"I was very disapointed with this book. After waiting years, nothing hapens in this book. It jsut drags along. Everyone just teleporting from one place to another, and getting no where. Rand dosent apear untill chapter 13, and then has mabey 4 chapters, Perrin has about 2, and Matt none. Nothing hapens to move the story along at all. There were a few good scenes in the book I will admit.If you love this series like I do, you have to read this book, then you have to wait with much longing to book 9. If you are new to this series, start at book one. The firest 5-6 books are wonderfull, take your time and enjoy them like I did. Then join me in the wait for the next book that hopefully will be what we were waiting for. Path of Daggers should have taken about 4-5 chapters to tell.Jordan is still then man, and I beleave he will make it up to us."
2,"A lot of words, but nothing happened","Fans of the series could skip this book and never know the difference, because the trend established by the last couple of books in the series continues... A lot of pointless chatter and very little action. Elayne and Nynaeve chatter mindlessly for most of their portions in the book (which seemed to be half the book). Perrin wanders aimlessly and accomplishes nothing. Rand worries about going mad and talks to Lews Therin some more. Mat is hardly mentioned and never appears. Egwene hassles with the Hall some more. I just hope Robert Jordan isn't milking the series. At least the end of the book contains some action and provides a good setup for book nine. Unless you must have the hardcover edition, wait for the paperback. Or just read the last chapter or two; they contain the only bits of any consequence in the entire book."
1,Another huge letdown...,"I was anxiously awaiting this book, as I had been doing for the previous two. Another letdown, I must say. I actually purchased the hardcover version of this novel in anticipation of the forthcoming events. In retrospect, I can't remember one significant thing that happened in the book, as far as the major plotlines go. DO NOT purchase this book...take it out of the library or something....it was a complete waste of paper."
4,Fortunately time is not a pressing factor for me,"In this newest installment of Robert Jordans: ""Wheel of Time"", I found though clipped a little short of his usual grandeur,it was an excellent book. Though I admit it did leave me salivating for more and resulted in a stomping around my house with impatiance and vexation. However every one has demands they need to meet, included it seems is our very own Robert Jordan. This in mind I will huff quietly and be content on lesser books untill Mr. Jordan can fathom the time and genius it takes to continue his masterpiece that is the ""Wheel Of Time""."
2,Time-out for the Wheel of Time,"I waited two years for this! If this is where Jordan is going, it's time to end this series. Nothing happens, it takes almost Three hundred pages for Rand to even appear. Wrap it up Robert."
3,"Something needs to happen, but it doesn't in this book.","As much as I love this series, the last two books really haven't thrilled me. I remember reading the first books, and at the ends all I could say was ""Wow,"" but not at the ends of these last two books. The first few books were packed with events, and went somewhere. It seems like progress is slowly (very slowly) being made, but nothing, or close to it, is actually being accomplished. It is time to pick up the pace! After reading six hundred pages, I said, ""Where was the ending? What was the point of this book?"" Someone needs to tell Jordan that the books better start getting somewhere soon, instead of just inching toward a goal, that, once reached, seems to be torn away in the blink of an eye. Maybe he's lost his touch, but I sincerely hope not. Now, it's time for all these events that have been put into play to (finally)come to fruition."
3,For addicts only...,"OK, if you're reading this, you're going to buy the book. Just don't expect anything to get resolved. I pre-ordered to make sure I got it hot off the press, and am now wondering why I bothered. It was a great read (as usual), but I expected that at least Jordan would tie up ""some"" loose ends before the end. Instead, he made things more complicated. *Sigh*, so now I wait for volume 9."
5,"Can you say ""GET A GRIP""","Please people if all you have to say is that Robert Jordan is long winded then you have reached way past old. Also for those people who believe that he is milking it for everything it is worth. You must understand the man has a publisher and a publishing company, if anyone is milking anything it is most likely to be them. Now for POD IT'S a great book, and to be honest I am kind of glad the really didn't get to Mat. It just leaves more room for him in book 9.(which is not going to take another 2 years to write!)Please people if you can't handle details and elaboration Robert Jordan isn't for you. For THE ""WOT fans""we have all learned how to wait. I will leave it with that!!!!!!"
3,Worst of the series - so far,"If this is the level from here out, Jordan has bitten off more than he can chew. Rather than tying things together, he appears content on adding as many threads as possible. This may speak well for his imagination, but the result is a weakening of the tale.At this point I don't know who has become more flatulent, Jordan or Goodkind."
4,Better than Crown of Swords,"The story line does not advance very far, but the interactions between characters are continually interesting.This one is a considerable improvement over Crown of Swords, in which it seemed 200 pages were wasted in overwrought, anxious hand-wringing over whether various allies of Rand would start fighting each other, or stop trusting each other, or stop trusting Rand, etc., etc. Such hand-wringing does occur here, in passages about the motley group of women led by Elayne and Nynaeve, but it's more limited and not as overdone."
3,"last battle, will it ever come","I read all of his 8 books, sad to say i am getting more and more disappointed with Jordan. The story never seems to end. If you follow his books, is there any need for egwene or elayne or her near sister. The only character that does anything in the book is Rand'al Thor. Jordan should complete the series. Will the LAST BATTLE EVER COME? I am pretty much sure by the time the last battle comes, i will be old myself and facing my own last battle, it has been more than 5 years since the beginning of the series. Doesn't jordan think that his fans should see some sembelence of ending."
3,More of the same...,"Jordan has once again written an entertaining book, but since this is the 8th book in the series we expect something more. Some of the dangling plot threads are wrapped up, but in true Jordanite style he manages to create a lot more. Only for the followers..."
2,Rober Jordon bad hair day...,".. I bought all 8 books and lost 2 months of my life. It was a fantastic and wonderful journey until book # 8. It just stood still. Robert was trying to weave to complex a weave and the ""Gateway"" just did not materialise. Rand should send him to the Wise Ones.He has such a rich story to tell, but Robert's style failed badly here. What he needs, and we should demand, is a collaboration with Tom Clancy to deliver the remaining books. Even the Aes Sedai nees to link to accomplish great things."
2,Like a hamster in the Wheel of Time ...,"The 8th in this monumental series seemed like a 591 page stalling tactic. The characters had little growth, and the plot lines moved forward too slowly. Favorite characters (i.e. Mat, the Ogiers) were ignored, as was the history and culture of his world. Instead it was the petty politics that got the attention. A shame. Maybe in book 9..."
2,Enough already! Please get this series over with!,"I started reading this series when I was in my mid-thirties and I was engrossed in the early volumes. However, it seems that I will die of old age before Mr. Jordan will see fit to put this thing to rest! I can understand writer's block, Mr. Jordan, but please quit writing this series if you can't submit any better writing than you exhibited in the last two or three books. I would recommend that anyone interested in reading this series to wait until the paperback has been released; don't spend your cash on a hard cover book in the series unless the writing improves."
1,REAL AVERAGE RATING,WAIT!!!The rating for this book is all wrong since 200 fools gave it 5 stars before the book was even released. The real rating is about 2 stars and only because of his previous great work. Buy this book used (mine is available for $5) but don't support this terrible turn of the series!!!
1,Not worth the wait or the money,"Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series begins wonderfully with the same feeling of legend that one gets from reading Tolkien or watching Star Wars. The eight book in this series however, only continues a downhill trend that began after book four. Jordan's caracters have become increasingly and frustratingly flat and undynamic. Rand especially has gone from a confused but very human young man on an adventure to a bitter and completely static caracter. And the same holds true for the rest of the cast. Perrin and Mat have become shockingly immature in their inability to recognize or feel adult emotions. And the women have all become singleminded in their respective tasks. What Jordan needs to do to revive this epic is to show us some kindness, bravery, and love in his angry, duty bound plot, and to start answering the myriad of questions that have been raised and left hanging."
2,I only bought it because I've got the first seven,"What in the world of time has happened? Most of the time I'll read a book in a couple days (most of the first seven books I read in one or two sittings), but I've been struggling through this one for almost a week and I'm only halfway through. Why, may I ask, do we have to wade through 240 some odd pages of no movement whatsoever in the plot until we finally get to see Rand? And where is a little action? Dialogue? Hopping around to see what ALL the characters are doing? I have to say that if the next book (which I guess we'll see sometime next century) is like this one, I may have to wait until it goes on the clearance rack before I buy it. Unfortunately, I'm hooked, and this series will eternally have space on my bookshelf. I'm disappointed, but I shall persevere!"
2,Wheel of Time takes a vacation,"First off, I have absolutely loved the first seven book of WOT. Secondly, Book Eight is a disgrace to the previous seven.The eternal struggle between good and evil seems to be on vacation. The plot lines have hardly been advanced and the climatic scences that have closed the previuos books was sorely missing. Mat is competely missing from this book, which is a shame. It felt like this book was meant as a placeholder, setting up all of the storylines to continue in book nine. I felt robbed that I waited 2.5 years for this. I am hoping that Book 9 picks up where book seven left off. For the first time in this series, I won't re-read this book."
1,Waste of time,"Worthless.How can people call his series an ""epic""????Just worthless.Stop milking the public, Jordan, and stop killing trees. If you continue to make these books, at least use recycled paper!"
1,no novel should be this bad,"The heading says it all. Why on earth do we need this many books in a series if they're all going to be like this? And to think, people are paying money to be able to read this!!"
5,Path of Daggers,This is definitely not a book to read if you have not read the series leading up to it. Its a great continuous of the series but leaves you wanting...
4,Not THAT bad...,"All poor reviews state that the plot comes to a grinding halt, and that the characters are poorly developed this late in the series. The main characters, however, have been developed over 7 other books. How much more in depth do you need to understand them? The plot is slow at times, this is coming from someone who is on book 10 currently, and started reading the series less than six months ago. But I admire Jordan for creating such a thorough world, building up to the Last Battle. I appreciate the random chapters from seemingly irrelevant characters. I enjoy the fact that all of these things have to be happening, and at the same time, in order for the end result to happen. Unfortunately, that translates to several hundred pages and some slow areas. But by now, you should know that is how Jordan works, and it's called Epic fantasy for a reason."
5,Awesome,"This book is totally, awesome! In fact that should read ""kicks butt""!! Jordon does a wonderful job of furthering the characterization of Rand and the others. His book tends to reflect reality - sometimes we need to wait. I am expecting a well written book nine as well."
2,RJ seems to be spinning his wheels,"It kinda seems as if RJ ran out of lunchmeat but decided to make a few sandiwiches anyway. I really enjoyed books 5 and 6, but I thought that aCoS was basically filler. Little did I know... I feel that if George R. R. Martin had gotten his second book out remotely on time that RJ would have already been dethroned as the King of SF fantasy. As it stands, I'm still hooked on Jordan's books, but one would have to admit that ""A game of Thrones"" was a LOT better than either of Jordan's last two efforts."
2,Where's Padan Fain when you need him?,"Each book in WoT is progessing toward unfathomable chaos. What started as a straightforward excercise in character and high fantasy has spiralled into a literary version of Rand's madness. All form and no content.And what's up with that prologue?Those who rate PoD ""5 stars"" are practicing conscious dellusion. A refusal to recognize that Jordan cannot even master the beast he has created. The only way of paring this ""plot"" down is to kill-off the characters, which, thankfully, PoD begins to do.Time to resurrect Moraine, remove approx. 95% of all characters, and let the core cast--Rand, Mat, Perrin, Moraine, Lan, Nynaeve, Egwene, Min, Aviendha, and Elayne (any more...?)--determine the fate of this age. I'd recommend Padan Fain for mass-assassination duty. And throw Bela into the fire for good measure. And all those epithets ad nauseum."
3,Good enough to keep hooked!,"It was rather disappointing to have no mention of Mat and his apparent first meeting with his bride-to-be, but the storyline was, once again, classic Jordan at it's best. The low points were the lack of information on the Atha'an Miere, not enough of Perrin and his attempts at establishing a true form of government over the Prophet's peoples (hinted at actually happening in the next book), and the rather vague attacks on Rand by the Asha'man that were supposed to be protecting him. On the good side, this does appear to be a prologue for an incredible ninth book (as long as Mat does get to meet his bride!), especially with a reunification (???) of the White Tower in the making, a consolidation of Rand's eastern border, and the potential of other skirmishes with the Seanchan (once again, it may be Mat leading the army?!?!). As my summary puts it, it is truly a series that will keep me hooked, but hopefully it won't take another two years to get the next fix!"
3,"Not as good as LOC, but as good as COS","The paperback is on the shelves in Israel. It has little new to offer. Old Jordan fans will enjoy the familiar taste, but newcomers should start with the old classics."
2,Is RJ GRR Martin?,"If you compare the styles, they a VERY similar to RJ's first few books, fast paced, page turners. Could Jordan (everyone knows that is not his real name)actually be writing a parallel series? It could also explain why he takes so damn long to come out with each successive book in WofT and maybe even taking some of his reader's criticisms and improving on his writing in this ""new"" world. Its just fun speculation,....or is it?"
2,Why can't he get a move on?!?!?!?!,"An apparent attempt to stretch what could have been an exciting and enthralling 4 book series across 8 books (and more to come). Release the parking brake and floor that accelerator Mr Jordan, your fans are losing (have lost) patience."
2,Read George R.R. Martin Instead.,"I decided to read the Path of Daggers after coming straight away from George Martin's smashing Clash of Kings. And as I read, I kept wishing I could read Martin's next book instead. Robert, you've run out of steam! Maybe you should reread A Game of Thrones so you can remember what good fiction is. If I have to read one more paragraph about Nynaeve tugging on her braid or threatening to box someone's ears, I'll throw up! Get on with it, already!For those who want a fast-paced, well-written series that _will end_ in six books, read George R.R. Martin. His Game of Thrones will astound you. In the meantime, Robert, I think it's time to vacate the throne. You're just keeping the chair warm for George."
3,"It's been fun, but.......","This has been a fun series. Time for all good things to end, though. If there isn't a drastic change, I fear this will violate one of the great rules of story telling: ""...and they lived happily ever after"" is a great way to end any legend, no matter if it seems childish, and this seems to be heading in any direction but a pleasant end."
3,It was his worst book so far and it was still good.,"It was his shortest and most unfulfilling book.He started a tale and didn't finish it in the book.I am going to wait untill the next one though,it ought to be damn good concidering how he set it up in Path of Dagger's."
2,"thanks for the input, guys!","I have not bought the book yet. Thanks to you guys, I probably saved over $15 not buying the hardcover. I was thinking, since Mr. Jordan is not trying to finish this story, maybe we should. Here are some thoughts I have so far... 1. The guy that calls himself Taim right now, is most likely Demandred in disguse. Remember Bashere did not recognize him when he first present himeself to Rand? The real Dragon inside Rand's head screams murder everytime Taim is near. 2. As with male and female halves of the Source, I think evil is also divided in the similar fashion. The evil in Shadar Logoth is probably the female half. 3. I think the real importance of the character Min is that she will be the one who puzzles out the key to the final victory. She has the note from Herid Fel.Let me know what you guys think!"
1,"fluff, filler and a waste of good reading time!","When PoD first hit he shelves here I was SSOOO tempted to go out and buy it on the first day, But NO, I waited, so hubby had the ""pleasure"" of wrapping it and putting it under the tree. Much anticipated and eagerly awaited, Christmas arrived, then passed and I FINALLY had the time to sit down and devote precious hours to what I thought was going to be a worthwhile and joyful reunion. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!! I figured ""RJ""""s 7th to be an aberration, or maybe I was just expecting more for my money....whatever...but...""cheated"" is putting it mildly. FOR GOODNESS SAKE!!!!! I've carried and birthed two children and had two career changes in the time it's taken Elayne, Nynaeve et al to get to and from Ebou Dar!! Won't be wasting any more hard-earned on WoT!"
3,OK but too short,A path of daggers was slow in the start when battles and other things started to happen it ended. Mat seems to have disapeered completely much like Perrin did in book 5. Book Nine had better be good and tie up the loose ends at the end of this book. It aks more questions then it ansers. But it does contain some info on the Seanchan.
5,"Enrapturing, provoking, genius . . . Jordan.",I have been reading The Wheel of Time as each book came out for 10 years. I have never read anything that has captured my soul like this saga. The Path of Daggers is a continuation of the excellence and genius of Robert Jordan.
4,Another masterpiece!,"I don`t see how any of you can give this book a low rating. Sure, it may be a little slow in the action yet Jordan still is magnificent. No author can even come close to his quality of writing. I loved this book and think it was worth the wait! Book 9 will probably be the best in the series. It makes me mad to see people compare Jordan to Eddings or Goodkind. Although I admit Eddings is a terrific author, he cannot compare to Jordan. As for Goodkind.... I couldn't even finish his first book...terrible. Anyway, POD is an exceptional book. I recommend everybody to read it!"
3,Jordan is not the whole world....,"As we are treated to the latest installment of Robert Jordan's epic celebration of his stamina as a writer, I cannot help but wonder if Jordan helps or hurts the rest of the genre and indeed if his success hurts the much better writers out there. If you are disappointed by... 1. Jordan's inability to resolve anything of moment. 2. The tedium of good Rand vs. mad Rand... 3. Jordan's inability to write a female character who is not an arrogant bully.. Then read the best series out there...George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones and his upcoming Clash of Kings. Imagine....characters who respond like people, not archetypes, dialogue that doesn't sound like the average dungeons and dragon's game, and ACTUAL STORY MOVEMENT. So avoid the Path of Daggers, it leads nowhere."
3,What's going on here?,"I will be the first to admit that this is probably the best series ever published. In fact, I've read it eleven times. But this business with leaving out characters for entire books is starting to get on my nerves. . . I mean, first Perrin in tFoH, and now Mat in PoD? Mat was the most interesting character in the series, and although leaving readers in suspense for an entire novel may have some of us begging desperately for the next one, some others may be turned off from the series permanently. Hear our plea! STOP THIS NONSENSE!!!!"
3,Worst Book Yet,"This was the worst book in the series, so far. The plot goes NO WHERE! About the only thing that happened was that the weather got back on track, and that at the beginning of the book. And the last chapter shows promise, but between there it's blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Nothing goes on; it's like the beginning lasts until page 500-something. And Jordan focuses too much on Rand (who is, by the way this || close to losing it). Nothing ever happens with him. Now if Egwene had been mentioned more, we could have seen the White Tower fall, and Elayne get to Caemlyn sooner. And, for crying out loud, where was Mat??????? The next book had better be a lot better, or I just may give up reading this series."
1,"No action, only character interaction","Total disappointment! 1. No review of the story so far (I am not a WOT fanatic, so don't remember the details of the plot, had to skim through COS before starting this one). 2. Too many characters with similar names and the reader expected to know everything about all of them. 3. Almost 80% of the text is devoted to what each of these characters says to or thinks about the others. 4. No direction to the plot. 5. No sense of anticipation (in my opinion an essential ingredient). 6. No conclusion or feeling of achievement. 7. In short, NOTHING HAPPENS!Sorry, Mr. Jordan, but you have let us down. After so long a wait, we deserve more. Sure I would have bought the book even had I read these reviews earlier, but that is a measure of our need to see a conclusion to this saga and not an endorsement of your own plans to milk it to the maximum."
2,Book Eight WOT stands for Waste Of Time,"Jeez, what a tedious, overly complex, well you get the idea. We could expect one book of a series to lose momentum but two in a row is not acceptable. Some one else can suffer through the next two years in the making disaster, it will not be me."
3,Book Keeping,"Book keeping is what I call this latest novel. I see it as Mr. Jordan needed to tie up loose ends before he kicks our butts with book nine. Please, 3 stars should be the lowest anyone should go. I hate it when from chapter to chapter characters travel these great distances just to get to another key item in a plot line. Kudos to Jordan to keep the Randland time line honest and not leave alot of gaps or loose ends in his story. If book keeping needs to be done... so be it."
2,Slow and Painful,"We are just holding on for the end now. Not quite ready to write off the series, however we will be able to wait for the softcover next time, even at an estimated 4 year wait--the pain of reading this volume and tracking all the subsidiary characters will be remembered for some time, although the plot won't be."
4,People Complain Too Much,"I just want to say that ppl who complain about this series being too long should look to dune or lord of the rings for thier fantasy fill. I really like the way things are dragged out in Jordans series and PoD is no exeption. I feel that lots of Black Tower guys are developed that seriously needed it and I thought it had a lot of otherwise nice storyline advancements. I will be very sad when this series ends. And I really hope he doesnt end it because some of you are too impatient to his books. I cant wait for his next book to come out in November and I hope its 1,000 pages long and full of more interesting detail about the history of Randland and the Chosen."
3,"Oh, what might have been....","I really hate to give this book only 3 stars. It could have been so much more. The book came out a few weeks before finals, so I had about 2 days to read it. I have to admit, I felt a bit let down. Just a bit mind you. I understand that it is difficult to make plot line progress when all of your main players are off on thier own. It is not like the first few books when everyone was together or in a few groups. Still, even considering this I still want to know how it ends. I remember the feeling I had waiting for the Crown of swords to come out. That feeling you used to get as a little kid when you went to bed on christmas eve. I do not really get that feeling any more. I guess it could be me getting older or the story getting old. I still loved the book and the series. It just does not seem the same anymore. Maybe the next book will make me feel differant....."
2,I'll go crazy before Rand does if this pace keeps up!,"After two years of waiting, this book is a big disappointment. The parts that further the plot towards Rand's final conflict are few & lost among a huge amount of detail that have me worrying that I will die of old age before Rand ever gets there!"
2,much ado about nothing,"Jordan's epic saga has ground to a halt. This installment featured the character development of bit players to the exclusion of everything else - certainly to the exclusion of moving the plot along. Instead of focussing on the protagonists we've come to know from previous books, we got page after page of meaningless characters we'll forget about tomorrow.To make matters worse, the dead aren't really dead. In an attempt to bring back some of the Forsaken Rand killed off in the earlier books, the Dark One is now reanimating them and giving them different names. Sheesh. What's next? Moiranne rises from the grave in book 29, titled ""I doubt we'll see the end of this series in your lifetime.""Seriously, Jordan risks the entire series by meandering about aimlessly. And, at $28 for the hardcover, I think I'll wait for the next one in paperback. A reader questioning the value of what he reads is not a good sign."
2,This book is too short!,"First off, I love this series. Jordan is a genius and has created, in my opinion, the best fantasy series of all time. That said, I'm highly irratated that the books keep getting shorter. Jordanites, pull out your book six, seven and eight and compare them side to side. Tor has used larger type and fewer lines to create the illusion that the books are similar in length. When you calculate the average characters per line with the average number of lines per page and number of pages, you find the following: Book six-- 3,015,360 characters. Book seven-- 1,861,704 characters. Book eight-- 1,493,115 characters. Book eight is less than half the length of book six! Well, at least it costs more. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't wish for this story to ever end. This has been the best read of my life. But c'mon Robert, let's get with the program. You are too good to spend two and one half years to write half a book. How about a whole book next time sometime late in 1999?"
2,I'm badly disappointed with the pace of the story,"Although I discovered the series only recently I have enjoyed reading through from book one to seven in no time. So I already ordered book 8 some couple months ago. Amazon delivered and I started reading by the minute.The story itself still is as fascinating as it's been starting at the first book, and I also like the style of Jordan's writing, but I expected way more from the story. Sure there are some significant events but I have the feeling that it turns more and more into some sort of a soap opera.There's one hint here and another unresolved action there ... You'll know the answer to that (hopefully) in the next book.So well ... after having read the proloque only I expected to rate it at five stars. However after reading the whole book I can't give more than two."
2,"Worth the wait, but not worth the effort","I expected Rand to take one more step towards Tarmon Gai'don, but it seems that Robert Jordan left most of what is famous about his books out of the series. Elaida is mentioned once, and All of the main characters seem to do almost nothing throughout the book. Mat is completely gone and the deal with Perrin is described but not started. Not worth the effort"
1,Puh-lease!,"This is definitely an alltime low.. I cannot believe how this series is going down the hill. It took me forever to pick it up and start reading because I knew it was getting bad reviews, but it was worse than I expected. I think it has been deteriorating since book 5 anyhow. What is most irritating is how the women are being portrayed once again. They're all thinking about sex all the time, Nynaeve with Lan - Min, Elayne and Aviendha with Rhand - Berelain with Perrin etc. etc. Furthermore they're all in either a bad mood or pouting, sulking and complaining the day away. Yes, we all know now what an incredible hunk Rhand really is, how powerful and handsome, bla, bla. Could Robert Jordan please go back to his original high standards or write one more book to tie up all the (thousands of) loose ends? My new hero is George R.R. Martin with his 'Song of Fire and Ice'."
3,Robert Jordan am ok,Robert Jordan is am the most bad gramer awther in the wurld and they shouldnt make buks liik thisun bicos it is long and words and i dont undrestanding it much.
5,never ending goodness,"ya ya, I know the series never ends, and that many people are tired of reading it. But I read the series straight through, with little to no pause between the volumes. So, I cant really distinguish the different books, and different points in the plot. The characters and the world Jordan creates are engrossing.When I think of the series, it always seems to me like its one long book. That is why I find one book no better than the next, they all are equal in their part of the story. If Jordan could have released the whole series as one book, then all the moaners would be mute.If you have started the series, I urge you to continue reading it, it has the most complexe and twisted plot of any fantasy series I have ever read, and beleive me I have read a lot of fantasy."
1,Uninspired,"Robert Jordan has woven a very tangled web in the WOT and now is apparently a fly trapped in that web. Let me begin by saying that I have read and enjoyed most of the series. However, after reading Path Of Daggers it became painfully obvious that Robert Jordan has tired of the series much more than I have.In looking at the characters we see people who are being written into tired old patterns. These are good well developed characters that the author is losing touch with and therefor so are we.Jordan needs to learn to tie a knott. Every book leaves more unanswered and uninspired questions, while avoiding any real resolution. Obviously, this series is in peril of ever being concluded.Unfortunately, this book is a must read for the series but I would suggest the paperback version. Although it may look small next to all those hardcovers it aptly describes this book's place in the series."
2,Boring,"This book was the worst book in the series, there is no doubt about that. Robert Jordan's fans had to read through this long and boring book. They had to put up with Elayne chapters that just would not end and listen to her whine and complain. Mat the best character was not even in the book. This book went on forever but nothing happened until the very end. Jordan's next book is better but not by much. His new book coming out had better be better then his latest work."
3,The Wheel is missing a few spokes,"Jordan is going nowhere very slowly. While the book was decent nothing really happens. If you want to read a GREAT book pick up George R.R. Martin`s ""A GAME OF THRONES"". He makes Jordan look like an amateur, and that is saying a lot because I really like W.O.T."
3,Nice Prologue!!!!,If it was'nt for the first 7 books I would have put the book down after the first few chapters. It seemed to be a transition book. A lot a build up with no resolve. Jordan better start wrapping things up or were looking at another 8 books and 10 years. I love the series but I'd like to finish it before I grow old and die. By the way is Mat still berried in Ebu Dar???
3,I waited over 2 years for this?,"Man, I don't know what disapointed me more... the lack of Matt or the Seanchen. I love the series, I've read it straight through at least 10 times (mainly because he's taking so long with it!), but this was disapointing. Nothing dramatic besides a few lunatic channelers. Not even a good Forsaken plot to stir things up. If he takes another 2 years and comes out with a book like this, I can't see myself being very happy. Remember when the books were first released, and he just churned them out? Was it me, or were those first 5 just plain better? These last 3 have been very flat. The only thing I found very cool in this was Egwene finally taking control."
5,I Can't Wait for the Next One!!!,"As a devoted fan of the Wheel of Time series, I enjoyed The Path of Daggers immensely. The complex and intriguing world created by Robert Jordon continues to hold me in its spell even after seven books. While I did miss the presence of Mat and other personal favorites, I realize that it would be impossible to do justice to the multitude of fasicinating characters of the Wheel in one book. There is more that enough intrigue with the characters that are in this book to make a a second or third read as exciting as the first. While I await the next book as impatiently as I awaited this one. I would not want to rush Jordon's next book one bit. The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills."
4,Jordan's Path of Daggers is full of intrigue,"I enjoyed this book immensely, but found that it was exceedingly complicated. It displays fantasy on a grand level, and continues in its development of Jordan's characters, but for those who have not refreshed their memories on the previous 7 novels it would definitely be confusing. I am guessing that Path of Daggers is leading up to a grand finale one of the next two novels, which certainly accounts for its lack in resolving many of the subplots. For anyone who is into intrigue, fantasy,and Robert Jordan,this is a great (and necessary) read."
3,"Short, slow but moments of hope!","The three rating is one that implies mediocricy. This book though, although well written will be largely judged by its plot. On that ground the 3 out of 5 is fair. The developments are interesting but too slow and they incremented marginally over the last two books without any climax. A good read particular towards the end. Don't expect any major surprises.Robert Jordan has his work cut out with the next book in the series, titled ""Winter Hearts"". Lets hope he saved the best for last."
3,To be crazy or not to be crazy?,"Path of Daggers was good but slow at times. I think it should have gone farther with the story lines started in it, but I'm sure Mr. Jordan has something big in mind for Book 9. For some reason I was really bored reading the chapters to do with Rand. Is he going crazy or no. There was a big mood change for him from Book 7 to this one, I hardly felt as if I even knew him, but after he reunites with Min things get better. All in all good reading, I just wish it continued on longer...now I have to wait for book 9........YUCK! I hate waiting!"
1,...disappointment...,"I was awfully disappointed in this book, not that I expected any better after ""A Crown of Swords"", but it seems to me that the series is getting worse and worse. In the last few books, the style has grown monotonous (the books aren't completely about how Nynaeve pulls her braid, though that isn't really evident here)and the plot doesn't advance in the least, despite the weight of the book. I wonder whether Robert Jordan will ever write as well agian as he did in the earlier books."
3,"Please, I can't take it no longer","Robert Jordan, if you read this, or anyone. I have started for the second time to read the series, and I needed it. This complexe world needs studying. I love every world of it, naturally, and I waited for book 8 to come. I liked it, i read it and I want more. But also, I agree with many, the book didn't solve many of the loose ends Jordan must start having problems with. How is everything to come toghether? And please, Jordan, end the saga, tell us the end, don't write ten more books and then ten more books. Let me also say that I love Margaret H. in Amazon press for what she writes about Rand and his connection to Lews."
1,Take out the trash,"Yet another in a series already grown overly long, A Path of Daggers manages to drone on for excessive length and take up space on your bookshelf, all without having any plot, story, or merit to speak of. This once enthralling series has grown stale and tired - it seems that the ""path of saggers"" Robert Jordan speaks of is the one a person must travel in order to trudge through this series.(On a side note: Being a bestseller does *not* equate quality. Some nimrods may do themselves well to learn this)"
1,Yuck!!,I never would have believed I could say this. But my once favorite series of all time has gone from excellence to garbage. Reading these last two books has been torture. When the series started out it focused on only one character now i am forced to read pages upon pages about whining woman. This series is on life support it needs a jumpstart.
1,RJ should know when to stop,"Path of Daggers is filler, pure and simple. The grand wheel of time series, which has been hearlded as ""the greatest fantasy series ever"" by its rabid fans, screeched to a stop years ago. What we have now is an author and a publisher that have realized (correctly) that all they need to do is put Jordan's name and ""The Wheel of Time Book number so-and-so"" on a cover and it will be a bestseller. Path of Daggers is an insult to his readers everywhere, full of maudlin, soap-opera developments and so many new characters that no one even can remember who's who. And the thing is no one, not even the author, knows how long this series is going to last! A famous author, Margaret Chittenden, said it best: ""Be sure you stop when your novel reaches the end. Bow out when your story is over. Put the cover on the typewriter or turn off the computer."" It's a pity that Mr.Jordan doesn't know how to do this."
1,"Condescending, disrespectful","I am so disappointed in this book. I personally returned all three copies I got for Christmas. Nothing happens - except that Mr Jordan met his deadline for another customer-fleecing and made an already wealthy publisher some more much-needed pocket money. I feel disrespected - I was hoping that after 7 (in which very little happened) the plot would get revved up again and I could experience the excitement I had felt reading the first 5 books. What a clever trick - get your stupid readers hooked with the quality of the first few books, and then churn out some absolute drivel to keep them hanging - take their money but leave them questioning the wisdom of ever having started to read the series in the first place. Mr Jordan, we are the ones who have put you where you are, and have made you as well-off as you are now - show us more respect, stop being so lazy and start writing in the manner we know you can. Your integrity is seriously challenged by this book."
2,All of this book COULD have been written in 3 pages,"When you have to wait roughly two years for a book and then, because you are hooked on the series, cough up enough money for the hard cover, it may as well contain something of a story. Oh sure there is plot and interesting events and revelations but where are the characters that made the series so popular in the first few of the books.If you follow the story you could use this book as a handbook to politics of WoT (part one). If the trend is to be followed, more political descriptions will have to occur. Maybe book nine? Possible title: The Various Promises Made by Mat in His Running For Mayor of Salidar: with a commentary by Mike Duffy (Canadian political commentator)The story is non-existant and the flow is choppy, so why didn't Jordan write this entire book like he did the battle for the white tower, as a summary with no conclusion. This entire book would be a chapter, leaving room for actual storytelling."
1,A True Disappointment,"An awful book. Let's face it, the previous seven were not great fantasy literature, but they were addicting. Book 8 cured my addiction.In fact, I plan on taking all of the previous books to a used book shop and selling the lot of them, I'm that frustrated. I won't buy another in the series.Its one thing to rip off Dune and a host of other classics, but its another to grind your series to a halt in hopes of selling a few more books. Nothing happens. We learn nothing more about the major characters and a confusing set of new characters are introduced to slow the storyline down even more. Don't waste your money on this one, folks, even if you have read all of the previous seven."
2,Quicksand,Just finished the book and had the feeling I was swimming around in quicksand. There is alot of action but in the end you find that not only have you not advanced anywhere but in reallity you are further away from the destination. The problem I have is that since I'm hooked I will not be able to avoid the next book unless I do some serious therapy. It is a real pity beacuase I was trapped in the begining by something different and well written. I realise that this is being drawn out bok after book for purely comercial reasons just like a television soap opera!
2,where is all the action?,I think that of all his books this one is most frustrating to me because there is no conclusion to the events that he built up in the 672 page book. This series has been great at hooking me in and I have found it hard to put the book down at certian points. When I finaly finished the book I was so dissapointed that I threw the book down. You should not be allowed to end a book without concluding at least some of what has been going on throught the whole series!
2,Interminable,"Oi. I don't know if it's because I'm getting bored with this series or if it's this book in particular, but it took me months to get through this book. I couldn't stand to read it. Endless descriptives that would slow the pace, that I'd end up just flipping through, and the story just seemed to inch forward that I had to put the book away for days/weeks at a time. Really? Does this have to be 12+ books long??? It did get better toward the last 1/8th section of the book with the pace picking up and more interesting, significant events starting to happen. Maybe someone can come up with a Cliff's Notes version of the whole series that will cut out a lot of the fat. The first 4 books flew by quickly and I'm disheartened that things are starting to grind down. Is book 9 going to be better? Hope so. I'm committed now."
2,Second worst book of the series,"While we finally get a conclusion on the Bowl of the Winds (which started in Book 6), we unfortunately get a new situation with Faile and the Shaido (which lasts an ungodly 3.5 books!). While Crown of Swords started the downturn in the tight exposition, this was brutal in some spots. The Elayne chapters, along with the annoying bickering with the Windfinders, were nigh unreadable. What's worse, Mat is missing from the entire book (after a cliffhanger ending for him in Book 7). While Rand's scenes were interesting, there was really no movement for him in this book. A weak entry, and sadly, not the worst book of the series."
1,Just plain wrong,"I bought path of daggers on cassette and have been both confused and upset with it. I have enjoyed listening to the well done and unabridged first 7 books read by Kate Reading and Michael Kramer. For some reason on the 8th book Jordan decided to have somebody else narrate it although the original narraters pick back up in book 9.What I dont understand is why if you are being paid to read a book, the eigth in a series no less, that you didnt at least listen to some of the previous narraters so you could pronounce names and places the same.Mark Rolston seems to go out of his way to pronounce EVERY name differently. It is hard enough in this series to keep up with who is who without trying to figure out which person he is talking about because the pronounciations are completely different."
1,A boring stale old tale written by a greedy author.,"Would give this book 0 or negative stars if that were at all possible...This book is full of useless descriptions which have no relation whatsoever to the book and about 2% of the whole world actually care about. Time after time when you encounter a certain person, a whole page is literally devoted to what the character is wearing. The continuous plot and character add-ons are going nowhere except to lengthen the span of this continually bad series and has no purpose whatsover except to earn the author extra cash. Enough is enough. This worthless pack of dirt has brought me to the conclusion that the ONCE actually interesting series is now dead and cold. If you are interested in fantasy, I suggest Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Tolkien, Robin Hobb, or any other fantasy writer who thinks about the story he/she is writing and NOT his/her wallet."
2,If the next one's this bad....,"This book was nothing more than filler put out during a time when Jordan was getting hassled by fans and publishers. It did reveal a few interesting things which I'm sure will be useful to know later, but all in all, this book could have come out a lot sooner, and I still would have been disappointed. Jordan has done an incredible job in keeping non-fantasy fans interested in his work; now he has to do better."
3,Glad I have the Book on CD,This was the last book on CD I was missing for my collection. So much I had forgotten since reading the book years ago.
3,No not as good as good as some of the others but...,"Interesting in its own way i think Jordan kind of ""hurried up"" this book. Not as good as Eye of the World, or Dragon Reborn, but there are some interesting new twists. The Seanchan invasion is quite exciting and some new briefings about Calandor. Egwene takes a firmer grip on her role as Amrylin, and plenty of foreshadowing keeps you earrning for Winter's Heart to come! Although i must admit i did not like the fact that Jordan did not say a word about Matrim Cauthon, and spent less detail on nynaeve, Elaine, and the Bowl of Winds, it certainly was a good book, doing more than hinting on wonderful things to come!"
3,Finish the story already!!!,"The book was ok, the overall series is great, but hey, this has been dragging on for long enough. At this point it seems like Jordan is prolonging things just to sell more books and it is getting quite frustrating. 8 books and more than 5000 pages is enough......"
1,Please Stop,"Listen, I'll read a cereal box if there is nothing else around, but I didn't even finish this novel. I read the earlier books while waiting for Goodkind's next work, and steadily began to regret not taking up TV.Mr. Jordan: I DO NOT NEED TO KNOW EVERY LEAF THAT FALLS FROM THE TREES. The pacing of these books is MISERABLE. For the LOVE OF GOD SPEED IT UP. I swear to GOD in Crown of Swords NOTHING HAPPENED. I'd invite Mr. Jordan to review the 3 act structure just incase he has become lost in describing to us the rustling sound mice make when they walk across the broken dried leaves of falls past."
3,path of daggers,"this book reads really slow like. i enjoyed gettin into another robert jordan book, but it read like the middle book of the lord of the rings. you just can't wait until its over. thats my review."
2,yawn...more of the same,What started out as a great series in books one through three as degenerated into a soap opera. There's a lot of words but not a lot happens. Jordan needs a good editor to get him back on track.
5,As a fan would expect. See the Wheel Turn!!!,"As with any fan of WoT who has been eagerly waiting for this latest book, The Path of Daggers is exactly what we have come to expect. With his unique story telling ability, Robert Jordan weaves a great tale. We see Rand still working on uniting the world; Perrin working as his general; Elayne moving to take her crown; Egwene taking control of the rebel tower... BUT WHERE IS MAT? More than any other book is the series, we can begin to see the parts coming together for the final battle as predicted in the Prophesies of the Dragon. After waiting three years for this book, waiting for the next one will seem just as long."
2,Does Jordan think he's writing for a daytime soap?,"Well, all I have to say is I'm clearly very disappointed with this latest offering. Although, some parts were interesting reading, most of it was just plain boring. Path of Daggers lacks action, focus, and most importantly, it lacks Matt...What in the world happened to Matt? Matt had been built up to be one of the, if not the most interesting character in the series, and he wasn't even in this book. Mr. Jordan has to realize his diehard fans may be very vocal and voice their praise even if he writes 1000 pages of rubbish, but his READERS are slowly finding it harder and harder to shell out the dollars for his endless soap opera."
2,Most disapointing,This has to be one of the most disapointing books I've read. I can't believe I've waited 2+ years for this! I wish I would've barrowed the book from a friend than wasted the money on it.
3,Story line is dragging.,"Book #7 did not progress too far, but Mr. Jordan gathered quite a few strings and tied them off. I expected much more for #8. Still interesting, of course, but I closed the book feeling a bit disappointed."
2,"Path of Daggers, Cumbersome","I had not read Jordan, before and wanted to get into some of his work. I had just finished reading several of Martin's books and they were fantastic. I figured Jordan's would be of the same type and I could continue where I left off. Not so. Jordan's Path of Daggers is one of the driest, most cumbersome works I have ever picked up. There is so much reference to people, places and names for which there is no association to relate. I found the book a real chore to read. Wheras Martin's books flowed, Jordan's bogged. I do not recommend this one. It's like reading a dry play. Maybe if I had suffered through the previous books he wrote, I might have a little better idea of where he was headed with it. As it was, I just could not get into it. Sorry."
1,The Longest Train Wreck in the History of Fantasy/Sci-Fi,"This series is a disaster and I can only hope that this latest installment means we're nearing the end. The first book MAY have been worth 3 stars, if you're feeling charitable. The series has gone downhill steadily. Previous reviewers nailed the exact troubles with this book so read them. The biggest shame about this book and the series is that it serves as a massive distractor from other better fantasy writers."
2,walking in place,After reading this book i have gone from a total r. jordan fanatic to a fence sitter i was very disappointed in this book. i get the feeling i am on a treadmill going nowhere.If the next book is as bad as this one i am not going to buy any more until i can find them on the cheap in a used book store.
2,"If #1 was this poor, I would not have continued.","The slide into irrelavance continues. I had noticed that the two previous entries into the Wheel of Time tended to drag out the minutia and compact the plot developments. The Path of Daggers continues the trend. Out of 591 pages, 25 are relevant to a few plotlines. The balance is annoying fluff. I am finished with this series and this author. Congratulations TOR and Mr. Jordan on publishing a really big paperweight."
1,Don't waste your money- check it out from the library.,"After waiting for 2 1/2 years for this book, I was horribly disappointed. Nothing happens. 591 pages, and it's all prologue for book 9. (Or, the way the series is going, book 12, perhaps.)I'll be checking out the next book from the library before buying it."
3,A mediocre addition to the overall amazing series...,"Frankly, I was expecting more. There's not as much to ""The Path of Daggers"" as the previous books. Not enough character development and less attention to detail really lessened my enjoyment. Jordan tries to maintain a number a storylines without putting enough effort into any of them. Better luck next year."
1,"You have to read it, but wait till Paperback.","If you like the series, then you obviously have to read PoD. Just wait untill it's in paperback. While I don't mind the ""soap opera"", I do mind that this book is missing it's other half. You know, the part with the ACTION. Almost nothing happend in this installment. PoD could be summerized in three chapters. I still have hopes for book 9 though...foolish me."
2,tripping,"I guess what i miss the most is the wit and the (almost effortless) imagination of the early books. The courage, existential bewilderment _and_ sincerity of the characters which gave the series its power have been superseded by the neurotic and the petty. And by special effects which often dilute the story. Looks like Jordan and Lucas Travel on the same ship...."
1,Too slow progress with the story.,"This last book was dreadful to read. Nothing happens. Why not put an end to this story now. There is enough stuff already to start another about e.g the time of Lews Therin, the original Dragon. Or why not about Arthur Hawkwing or somebody else of the ancient heroes mentioned in WoT. That would be enough for more than a lifetimes writing if the author still is interested in this kind of ""litterature"". This WoT is not an adventure any more. Maybe mr. Jordan has lost his interest in it. Or lost the thread. Or has he hired a ghostwriter? At least I hope he will find a way out of this hopelessly tangled web and finish the story as boldly as it started nearly ten years ago. I would like to read the last chapter of it while my vision is still good."
3,Asymptotically approaching a standstill....,"___After receiving the Lord of Chaos for a Christmas present, and never actually hearing of Robert Jordan, I decided to delve in to the book and discover what mysteries it might. Although at first I was assaulted by a barrage of undistinguishable new words, characters and phrases, I became unusually addicted. After reading all of Jordan's books, I must say that action has slowed down exponentially. In the Path of Daggers, I could summarize the plot in a paragraph. I don't think I can stand anymore cantankerous woman development character, and I wish that Jordan would revert back to his original state of equilibrium of action, plot, and character development.______________________"
1,There are neither beginnings nor ending to the P of Daggers,"Mr. Jordans very famous line is how he has begun almost every book in this series. But in the Path of Daggers, there really isn't any beginning nor ending. It was just lackluster ramble about a bunchof women who cackle about and feel insecure about their own part in the book.There is only one other series that I was even bothered to see how it ended - Raymond E. Feist's ""The Serpentwar Saga."" While the Wheel of Time as a series was a fantastic effort until now, I very much fear that a repeat of the Path of Daggers will only bring about an early Tarmon Gai'don to the series.Pleas sir, as so many of your faithful readers has already put it, ""Get on with it!"""
2,Slow and empty,"Dear Mr. Jordan, if you are reading this, please don't get insulted, but this is how I feel. I didn't give it 1 star, just because I have read all WoT books and I know you can write and I wanted to encourage you to finally do a good job ( It used to be great, but after last 2 books I am not sure you can do any better than good).It took RJ 2 years to write 500+ pages. It is about 1 page per day (not counting weekends, sick leave, long vacation, family crises, and those days when author simply has a lack of inspiration). It would have been OK if the final product wasn't so empty. I guess RJ wants to write as many books possible just for money. I would gladly pay 20 or 30 % more for a book and get some good stuff like the first 4 or 5 books.If you have never read any of WoT books it is a bad time to start now. You get hooked by the first few books and have to keep on buying some really boring stuff later."
2,PoD is well written but is not a fantasy novel,"Jordon continues his annoying habit of dwelling on character development while ignoring the story. PoD can not be considered a fantasy novel because a story never occurs. Events are described (thouroghly) but a consistent thread does not exist. Female characters continue to be unable to co-exist with one another and male characters continue to be overly concerned as to what the females are thinking. Multiple plot lines increase geometrically with out resolution or hint of resolution while pages upon pages of descriptive narrative pile up with out grabbing the readers interest. It would be much more fair to the buying public if this book was marketed as a prologue to book 9 rather than as a continuation of a stunning fanatasy series. Mr. Jordon, at least a couple of the plans being hatched by the multiple characters involved in the series must be progressing in some substantial way. Please bring them to our attention."
1,Author and editors have no respect for readers.,"No imagination. No action. No depth. Poorly chosen conflicts. Narcoleptic sub-plots of evil minor characters, that will be deleted, along with collateral damage from the friendly fire of Jordan's word-processor, later on. No delicious anticipation of meaningful chemistry with the truly nasty. After thousands of pages we have ancephalic stick figures runnning a great confrontation with evil like flat ink stains on paper. Is this all Jordan can come up with in better than 2 years? In his once magical world, passion and fear and honor no longer feed the action and dialog. Why didn't someone at the publishing house ask him why he wrote this insipid book? He will be booed on the street for this. It is a slap in the face of buyers."
3,"Better than the last one, but the series needs to get rollin","This one is an improvement over the last one, but doesn't live up to the tremendous expectations generated by the first several books. I'm sure the effort of creating a complete world with multiple cultures in such detail requires a great deal of work. Jordan is a fantastic writer and and I'm sure he will get back on track; but I just hope it's not going to take 20 years. From the rate at which Rand is conquering countries, it is going to take another 5 books before they can even begin preparing for the final battle."
3,Will Jordan ever put down the landing gear?,"Jordan seems to ""circling"" the airport!! The landing lights are on but we do not seem to be descending; only the quality of the books. This books seems to me to be an epilogue to book 7 or a prelude to book 9. Nothing of worth seem to happen or should I say nothing of worth until the final pages in which the pace does, marginally, pick up a bit. I'm a true fan and have read the serious many times, but, come on Mr. Jordan. You've teased us far too long to let us down now!!"
1,Robert you owe us big time!!!,"I had to read what other people thought of ""daggers"" before I put my two cents in. After two and a half years of waiting, this is what R.J. gives us? ROBERT!! you owe your fans an apology. I, like many readers, have read and reread the WOT series from book 1 to book 7 because it is a great story. Book 8? Who cares? I didn't think I could say enough about this book,I do not have to. Read the other reviews that are listed for ""daggers"" and you will get and idea how disapointed fans of WOT are. Robert Jordan you owe your fans BIG TIME. How about Book 9 in 6 months. A story line we could care about,or a hint that you are not milking this story so you can make more money(not that hold that against you... much). If anything I am hurt that I wasted so much enthusiasm for a ""chapter"" that, while written well and with the expected detail, left me disapointed and not caring if there is another ""chapter""."
2,Wait for the paperback unless your a big fan.,"I didn't find this eighth book of Robert Jordan up to the standard of the first seven. This is the first time I have read one of his books and had trouble staying interested. This book could have been written in 150 pages without any noticeable change in content. There were to many extraneous characters with little significance. The main problem though was the lack of any sort of Climax. Each of the other books has had a great climax but not this one. There were two minor pieces of excitement with the Asha'man and Callandor, Otherwise it was a big yawn. This is a tragedy considering all the potential this book had.I sure hope the next one has a little more excitement."
2,Book Eight Adds little to the story,"The Path of Daggers is a disappointment - I feel as though I bought tickets to a football game, and instead found a chess match in progress when I got to the arena. The previous Wheel of Time books at least made an attempt at being complete stories unto themselves, but this one takes us from point A to point A.2 without much new information given in the ~600 pages it takes up. In addition, many of the fanciful elements and characters are gone from this one - making it about as exotic as a faculty meeting.I am not entirely sure if this is the fault of Jordan et. al, or if it is because I've become a big fan of Kristine Kathryn Rusch's The Fey series in the time between the last Wheel of Time book and this one."
2,"Book 2 Stars, Series 5 Stars","While I'm a fan of the WoF, upon picking up ""the path"" I found myself extremely disappointed, the book fails to live up to Jordan's previous work. Furthermore it's only about 1/4 the size once you adjust the margins and font size. Several of the main plot lines simply diappear, Mat. After ""the crown"" started picking up the action that was dropped in ""the fires"" I thought maybe the series was going somewhere again, however this book was an incredible let down. Jordan fails to continue the minor plot twists that you would find in the first couple books and now create further twists in the later books. i.e. Paitr, prophetic images, and the dramatic irony that keeps myself and many other fans captivated."
3,"Loosing sight of the true magic, RJ?","The book seemed to wonder a bit and the charachters seemed to loose a little of their depth. Where is Mat, he was always a key player previously and now he just vanishes!! PLEASE! The storyline seems to have changed a bit as well, has Rand lost sight of his true goal. To defeat Shai'tan he seems more intent on building his own empire (much like the forsaken he has defeated). Much of the mid story suspense seems to have gone missing, maybe because the playing field has become so large and the number of pages in the book so few. Overall the book is still entertaining, but after more than a years wait! well in all honesty it was just dissapointing. I still think the syeries as a whole is one of the best and will definitely buy book 9 as soon as it hits the shelves. But I feel RJ should once again grasp the true magic as he did with the first 6 books."
2,Out of control !!!!!,"The first book of the series was by far the best, with each additional book, at times lost in too many side shows, secondary characters, etc... Mr Jordon has asembled a very good cast, locations and theme but the series seems to have a life of its own, focus on the main characters more. This book is worth reading but PLEASE Mr Jordon, tighten up some !!!!"
2,Disappointing. . .,"I absolutely devoured the first 7 books of this series, and waited anxiously for the eighth. To say that the plot in this book is slow is like saying that the Pacific ocean is pretty big. Had there been some character development, it would have been better, but the characters change very little, and those that do do so in ways that are entirely too predictable. I will probably buy the next one, but THIS time, I'll wait for the paperback. Thankfully, this one was a gift, so none of my own money ws wasted on this disappointing effort."
2,Someone oil these damn hinges,"Scan, see description of Aes Sedai facial expressions. Turn page. Scan, find out what local grass, gravel and general foliage looks like. Turn page. Scan, learn for the eighth time what one of several hundred thousand characters looks like.Lay down, go to sleep. Dream of the days when I would re-read every preceding book when a new one would come out."
3,"Slow this time, but still a good read","POD is not the best of the series - maybe a bit too much on the details and a wee bit disjointed, but I'm hoping its a set up for fireworks. Anybody hear of when the final is coming to print? Yes of course I'm going to buy it <g>."
2,Disappointed,"I'll admit, I'm addicted to the series- the first 6 books were unbelievably good. Then I read COS, which lacks the plot and character development of 1-6. Path of Daggers is even worse! The story's not progressing and some of the six main characters are barely mentioned. What happened? Has Jordan died and his publishers hired freelance authors to finish the series? Either that or Jordan's just burned out from writing eight 700 page books in less than ten years. I hope he can finish the series without the books continuing to get worse."
2,What a disappointment!,"This, by far, is the weakest of the series. It reads as though Jordan only likes introducing new characters and new plot lines, but doesn't want to conclude any of them. There's no real climax in this one, either. And he doesn't make any effort to remind us what the Bowl of Winds is or who Cadsuane was or why she's important -- how did she help save Rand? This is stuff die-hard fans may remember, but it's not anything I thought about since I read the last installment.My advice to Robert Jordan: You've got enough plot lines and characters to round out another four books. Tie them all up and stop introducing new ones! And next time, have a book that has an ending we can appreciate!"
2,boring,boring book. didn't finish it. read the chapter synopsis's available on the net instead. too many characters (and can't remember half the people by now cos it's been so long since the last book and I'm not reading that one again either cos it was so long and boring). save your time and money!
3,can it get slower??,"Listen, i like the other seven books, but this got me nowhere. It looked like a ""between"" other books, one terrible long chapter in stead of a whole book. AT the ending it started gettin' excited, but then it ended. NOrmally the books have kind of an ending, this didn't. It stopped in what would have been the middle of a book. Now i have to wait another 1 1/2 year to finally finish the stories that ended in POD. I really hope Egwene will finally reach or enter Tar Valon in that part!!!!"
3,GOOD BUT STARTING TO SLUMP,I'm hooked on The Wheel Of Time series and still enjoy it very much. But when will it end and when is the next book being released?
1,"This is the story that never ends, it just goes on and on my","FRIENDS. I have been reading this series since 1990. The excitement begins to pale, the description becomes repetitive, the characters whine a lot more than they did when they first left Emond's Field. Oh, yes, my favorite part...Why was it that after the prelude did we never hear from the border monarchs again? That was just unneccessary. I always thougth that it would be great to have a series go on and on and never end...and for the most part I still feel this way, but if dear Mr. Jordan doesn't pick up the pace he's going to lose a loyal reader. I didn't even buy PoD, I borrowed it from the Library. Slogging through that book, I knew how Rand and co. felt slogging through rain soaked Illian. No one should pay money to experience that. I'll borrow book nine from the Library, give dear Mr. Jordan one last chance, but if its not up to par...it's over."
3,The books are slowing down,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all volumes in this series. The volumes are starting to get all consuming with Personal Power. I would like to see someone compromise on something. This series has very believable characters, but they aren't growing just growing apart. Try BELGRAID by David Eddings or INCARNATIONS by Piers Anthony to see good characters who work together and apart with an excellent story."
3,"Jees, Lets get on with it.","First of all I will say that the series is fantastic and I will keep reading them to the end. However, we do seem to be dragging a little bit. I don't mean to be critical of your work but it is hard not to say the women and the men to a lesser extent need to quit bickering and whining. The books are all still good and for all the people that say you are dragging it out for the money. Uggg! So what, drag it out as long as you like. Jes, that is the way to make money then do it. And for all the people that say you can't juggle the char's get a life. What right do we have to be critics anyway. If you are a published author then you have the right. Otherwise shut the heck up and let Mr. Jordan do as he pleases. Yes, we all want the books to come to closure soon but if thery don't so what just keep reading until they do. I for one think that if you want to make a lot of money on the books then that is your business not mine."
1,Greed over Greatness - the tragic end of Robert Jordan,"This series has hit rock bottom and is beyond salvage. I don't know how anyone could possibly give it more than 2 stars (2 is generous and probably only from Jordan's relatives). The first four in the series were great. I became hooked. It has gone down hill rapidly since. Five and six were boring and after Crown Of Swords (another awfull Jordan novel), I did not think things could get worse. POD proved me wrong again. I'm kicking the habit. So long Robert Jordan. You were within grasp of greatness. I hope you enjoy all the wealth accumulated from this series because respect and greatnes is no longer possible."
1,Too many books!,"There's gonna be at least nine books in what was supposed to be a seven book series! My advice is to read every other book. Jordan spends at least 30% of his book stating what happened in his previous book. I got the books from my library and they only had the odds. Sometime later, I filled in the gaps. I wanted to see if I had missed anyhting. Nothing at all! For those who think it may have been the way I read the books, you're wrong. I did the same with Goodkind's books and I love them. Too much wasted time reading 3000+ pages. Skip a few of the books. It's more exciting and a lot better."
2,There is little to no progression in the Story line.,"I found The Path of Daggers a waste if time. Robert Jordan's attempts at explaining the inner emotional termoils of his charaters stalls the story line to a extent that nothing ever happens. This book could be summed up in a couple of pages not 591. For those of you who don't want to waste time or money...The is no mention of what happened to Mat in Ebou Dar. Elayne escapes with the bowl of winds and corrects the weather. Leaving Ebou Dar for Caemlyn (nothing really interesting happens on the way). Egwene consolidates her position as Amyrlin Seat by Declaring War on Elaida. Parrin unspectacullarly obtains control for Rand in Ghealdan. Perrin also meets up with the Prophet with no conclusion and Faile is captured by the Shaido with no conclusion presumablly to follow in another book. If Jordan Treats Faile like Mat, we should be hearing about her again in another two or three book.In short This is a Disappointment."
2,What Happened?,"Did Jordan forget that Rand is supposed to be the principal player, or did he not mention Rand until chapter 13 because he is more intent on writing about the terrain and weather and bickering women instead of the storyline. Truly devastating to have to wait all this time, fork out the big dough to buy the hard bound edition, and get a book that did nothing for the WOT series. However bad this book, I have become addicted and will continue to read if it will bring closure to a wonderful storyline."
1,disappointing - repetitious- and at times downright boring.,"I resent it bitterly when Authors with Jordans gifts take believable and although not always likeable characters and turn them into simple minded unbelievable jackasses who could never survive in the world Jordan portrays. There is an end to every story and I think it is about time the readers reached the end of this while there is any interest left in the characters involved. Mr Jordan may write untill they nail him into his box but, that doesn't mean people will continue to read his books if he continues on the path he is now following. How many more books will have to be read to reach the end of the wheel Of Time series. I am 67 years old. At this rate I won't live that long so perhaps I will quite while I am ahead."
1,Like the NBA strike: who cares?,"Nothing new since book 4, although I really enjoy long, good books. Some fans take umbrage about the negative comments others have written about the length of the series, although size doesn't matter (at least that's what my wife says!. However, I want some character development, some progression of the plot and would it kill the fabulously wealthy Mr. Jordan to include a synopsis with each book? I am not going to read another book in this series until he has written the concluding book, and then I'll probably end up only reading the final 100 pages. Luckily my local library carries this series so the only thing I've wasted has been my time, not my money. I sum up the series with the following analogy: books 1-4: the movie ""Jaws."" Books 5-8: ""Jaws 4."""
2,Ready for some plot advancement? ME TOO!!,"I bought Path of Daggers immediately upon release, convinced against all evidence ( 7 books of it) that at long last Rand would begin the final approach to his great battle. I was sooooo wrong. Mr. Jordan, if I may address you directly, your soap-opera pacing is inconsiderate of the readers who have invested so much time and money to vaulting you to the top of the fantasy genre. I was left feeling like I'd read fifteen minutes of actual story--and it only took three days."
1,This book is very disappointing,"I was born and bred on heroic fantasy. I love the genre, and have thoroughly enjoyed Robert Jordon's work. I was introduced to Robert Jordon through his Conan stories, which are terrific. In 1994, I became aware of WOT, and digested the first 4 books as fast as I could. What a wonderful story this was. Book five began to drag just a little, but I eagerly awaited book 6, knowing that the story would surely pick up. Book 6 was slow, book 7 was bad, and I can't finish book 8.I am more than disappointed in the series now, I am a little sad. I feel that Mr. Jordon has lost his vision, and I cannot continue with him into the depths. I expect book 8 will remain unfinished; I can't bring myself to pick it back up. For those of you who might be discouraged from reading Jordon after reading the ever-increasing bad reviews of books 7 and 8, don't be. WOT is remarkable, but I suggest you stop with book 3.So long Mr. Jordon. I enjoyed it while it lasted."
3,Maybe Jordan Needs a Vacation,"I hardly think Mr. Jordan deserves some of the vituperation he's received in other reviews in this forum, but it's an unfortunate fact: of all the books in this series so far, this one's a chore to get through. Every character seems tired and dispirited and weary...and so, by extent, does the author. It shows. Alas, the book's a drag. I'm not counting Jordan out by any means -- ""The Wheel of Time"" is far and away too superior as a whole to dismiss on the basis of a single stumble -- but here's hoping Jordan rests up, recharges the batteries and knocks ALL our socks off with Part Nine."
3,Jordan didn't achieve the same ardency present in past books,"All 7 of Jordan's previous books captivated my imagination and attention. But to me, book eight is merely a sluggish prelude to the next book, which didn't satisfy my growing desire for more of the coming plot. Jordan just didn't write the 8th book with the same ardency he wrote the first seven books. It's bad enough he made everyone wait 2 years for this book. It could have been thought out a tad bit better. I advise reading a bit of this book at a library to test for your own opinion. Weather you buy it, or not, it's still worth reading. All in all, I'm still a loyal fan Mr. Jordan, and I'm eagerly awaiting your next book."
3,Not that lame..but pretty close.,"I will be honest. This book was far from the greatest thing I ever read. But, at the same time, I felt at ease reading it due to the fact that I was able to spend some quality time with the characters that I grew so close to in the previous novels. The book was too short, too slow, and at times too boring, but, you have to admit.....8 books is a lot to write for one story. I think anyone would be getting bored after writing that many books. I just hope that the 9th book is worth the price."
2,Out of 8 books .. this one is the worst.,Narrow and deep. This has to be the most plodding book since the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. For goodness sake what happened to the story??RJ has introduced more characters than I can keep track of. At the same time his glossary and character index has gotten smaller.The only reason I bought this one is I'm hooked.If #9 is awful you can find my collection in our next yard sale.
1,Don't be fooled by the average!!!!!,"As I write this, the average number of starts for PoD is 3.5, which is misleading. The vast majority of recent reviews have been 1 star. The only reason the average is that high is the fact that all the fans started giving 5 star reviews before the book even came out (in anticipation I guess). Don't be fooled folks. The book only deserves 1 star. RJ, you are losing your touch. Perhaps talent is lost with age?"
1,I feel cheated,"This book was attrocious. I thought the first seven were great (well, the seventh was a little weak) but this was a waste of paper. The idea is supposedly that each book in a series can stand alone on it's own merit. Not this one. Read the jacket cover(interestingly enough more happens in the jacket cover description than in the actual book. What was up with that?) and wait for book 9."
3,A so-so WoT book.,"PoD doesn't totally stink; it still has some interesting parts. The reading was kinda slow, though. Not as good as the previous WoT books."
3,"It was a solid, basic book.","Although most people think that Robert Jordan should be producing hit after hit after hit, its only natural for him to take a breather. The Path of Daggers is a good book, but compared to all the other masterpieces he has created, it seems insignificant. You must consider the amount of time he spends on the whole series, roughly putting out a book a year, plus the fact of several different books on the side. Taking this into consideration, you must also take in the emensly huge plot line and the amazing creativity of the over all story, and you realize that Robert Jordan can't be perfect all the time. To me, I enjoyed the book as much as the others"
2,Illustration versus Photograph,"Bob... buddy... a couple of words of advice. Wrap the damn series up before half of the fantasy fans in the world commit ritualistic suicide out of sheer frustration at the snail's pace the last couple of books have crawled along at. More importantly, in regards to your image appearing on the cover; stick with the sketch over the photograph my friend, you look like Anne Rice's love slave."
2,"Boring, but i'm still hooked",Nothing at all happend. It was a huge dissapointment. I really hope that the story goes forward in the next book. I'm really tired to read about the male/female problem all the time. Does'nt they have anything else in their mind. I have really enjoyed this series very much. I'm still hooked.
1,Pot-boiler par excellence!,I have been an avid reader of the ongoing Wheel of Time series but this was pap of the worst sort. A more overt exploitation of his frenzied readership could not be imagined. To have a plot hardly progress over 600+ pages is terrible. It appears that Jordan has set himself the task of writing the longest fantasy novel ever and in doing so has sacrificed all narrative integrity. Even as an addict I find myself prepared to walk away though I suspect that if you are considering buying this book you are already in so far it will be almost inevitable that you go on.
1,this fellow needs a good editor,"Unfortunately, Path of Daggers is far inferior to the other books of Robert Jordan. While I have great respect for him as an author, I think that this book would have benefited from a serious re-write. It is fractured with very little direction and no conclusion whatsoever. We are given snippets of each character's motivation and experience. But nothing ties them together (at least in this volume) and Jordan doesn't even try to bring the novel to some intermediate conclusion (as he did in No.7). I felt like he had some work in progress (pre-edit) and slapped a name on it and put it out to the public. It's reminiscent of the difficulties Stephen R. Donaldson had in his second trilogy of the IllEarth War. Sometimes more is not better and I think you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you buy this book. Borrow it from a friend or the library. I regret spending the money on it."
1,I hated this book,"Jordan is so confused about his convoluted series of plots that he doesn't make any headway toward wrapping things up. The characters just sit around and bore us. No action, just boring, boring, boring. Jordan should read some Goodkind to see if he can rediscover how to move a plot along."
3,"Roll on ""The Broken Seal""","When I first read this book it was a great disappointment - there were whole chapters that should have been ripped from it - making it a far more manageable tale. There are far too many minor characters in the Wheel Of Time now, who will just end up disappearing in the next book.The only thing that made me appreciate this book was that it was just an overlong prologue for the next story arc.I cannot wait until Book 9 ""The Broken Seal"" comes out in November, for I do believe that the action shall actually pick up then!"
3,"Slow start, finished strong","I thought this was a decent book. A good continuation of the Wheel of Time. I did find that not much was resolved in this book. This book, however did hint at a very strong Book 9 which I am looking foward to."
2,A dissapoint!,It was with great expectations that I looked forward to reading this books but as it went along I got more and more disaapointed. I really like the series but RJ seems to repeating all the thigns that we already have seen a thousand times. Especially this book is thin. It ends with no climates worth speaking of and it just seems to be a stop between one book and another and RJ couldn't get any good stuff in it because the publisher decided to make more money by publishing two books! I rated it 2 stars - in respect of the previous books which i really liked and have read many times. I really hope that RJ gets the next one better or I will stop wasting my money on them and find another favorite author!
2,"It had its moments, but...","There were a few chapters here that were really good, reminding me of the great excitement I felt as I read through the first 4 books. But on a whole, Book 8 fell short of my expectations, as did Book 7. The story is dragging so slowly now that it's hard to keep reading, and there are so many seemingly-inconsequential characters here talking about nothing that I sometimes can't help but skim foreward looking for Mat to appear. I'm crossing my fingers in hopes that the next book gets back on track."
3,A set up for the next book,A set up for the next book. I would of liked to read more about Avieanda and Pern and alot more of Rand.
1,Forget it,"This one is not worth your time, read one of the great new books out this summer, like ""The Triumph and the Glory."" The author obviously CARES about his readers and is passionate about the theme of his book, WWII. It is quite apparent that Jordan didn't care much about his latest book, so WHY SHOULD WE ?"
3,"First 300 pages were good, the rest...","I rather enjoyed the first 300 pages of this novel, quite alot of stuff happening with many of the various characters, but after that it seemed to crawl to a halt. I don't actually remember the ending, or the plot of those last 300 pages. I guess you could say it started out with a bang (literally) and then slowed down to a halt, kind of the opposite from how most novels are set up :)"
2,Boring and unfulfilling,"Some people are saying that RJ is writing an epic but you must realize that an epic is quality not quantity. This book did nothing for me and after 2 of them I no longer feel the need to wait for #9,#10,... I would rather read the first four books in the series and let my imagination finish the story than waste my time with 7 & 8. It's been a couple of weeks since i finished the book and I can't remember the details anymore. The books I read are for my enjoyment this wasn't one of them."
1,Zero Stars!,"Here is the content summary: Nothing, followed by nothing followed by 2 pages of a set up scenes to make us buy the next book. Read the cover in the local library and assume you can safely wait for book 9."
2,Disappointing,"Definitely not one of Robert Jordans best. It usually takes me under a week to read one of his book, this one took a month. I am a fan and would not have skipped this one but I should have waited for the soft cover version."
1,This was a complete waste of time! A mercenary exercise,"I got nothing out of this book at all. Has Jordan lost the plot? Did he write this get-nowhere tome just as a money grabbing exercise? I think he should get a move on with the narrative, and stop playing with us. A very disappointing book."
4,"Great books as always, but a little slow and little to read","As always Robert Jordan delivers a great story line on the continuing saga of Rand al'Thor's fight against the Lord of the Dark. This book contains fewer pages and a larger font than all the other books. Ih he slowng down or what? I think he is slowly leading us into a major battle by building up anxiety and tension over what is going to happend next. The actually plot of the story is thin. There is not much action wise. Rand's army going insane, Elayne working on her quest, Forsake meddling, etc.. None of the hard and heavy action. Overall I like it for what it contains, but not the length and slowness."
2,Let's get this moving...,"Okay, don't get me wrong. I've been addicted since book 1. But, sadly to say, I'm waiting for the paperback from now on... The story had all of the elements I've come to expect and enjoy, but just didn't go anywhere! Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but let's wrap it up already. Vamping for time just isn't working as well anymore. :("
2,Get on with it!,"The last 4 books have been like a treadmill. The same thing, over and over and over again. The first 4 books were wonderful. I loved every one of them. ...But it looks like we are now just being led about out for our dollars. Everything that has been accomplished in the last 4 books could have been told us in 1 1/2 or 2 books. We're being force fed cereal filler here. Let's stop the treadmill and finish the story. Give us some real accomplishments. Give us some conclusive movement toward the final battle. We are putting money in the pockets of Jordan and the publisher. Let's start getting something for our buck again. ...Like we did with the first 4 books."
3,Keep it moving,"I happen to like books that never end, but I also like it when the plot GOES SOMEWHERE. Mr. Jordan's only current failing is that he neglected to progress the storyline."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is garbage. Jordan is a horrible writer and this book proves it. I have read the whole series over the course of the past decade, but no more. If you like fantasy, check out Eddings, Martin, McCaffrey, Anthony, or any one of a number of new authors. You don't need to read this series, there is so much better out there."
1,"""A PATH OF DAGGERS"" IS, SADLY, NOTHING MORE THAN A PROLOGUE.","I have always thought of Jordan as an artist who writes for the pleasure it brings to himself and to others. After reading ""A Path of Daggers"", I begin to doubt his commitment towards his fans. PoD is a startling disappointment. 75% of the book does not advance the plot, the reason being that most of the book is spent in petty, monotonous character development (if you can imagine an entire chapter devoted to Nynaeve's squabbling with the Knitting Circle). The book seems to only have more plotting and schemes but no ground-breaking events occur--as if Jordan meant this entire book to be nothing more than a prologue for his next book. Also, the disappointing number of dramatic events and the uninteresting climax subtracts from this book's value. This installment is just another ""build-up"" book for Jordan's series.IT MAKES ME WONDER IF MY FAVORITE AUTHOR, ROBERT JORDAN, IS UNDER A DARKER INFLUENCE THAN MONEY..."
1,Reprise,"I already gave a review but I wanted to add these last few points that I forgot to mention. I purchased the hardback version of book 8 ""The Path of Daggers"". I will not do so for the next ""several?"" books. With so many other soft cover fantasy and sci-fi books of very high quality around I find it difficult, no impossible, to purchase a hardback version of a book in a series of books that has become so ho-hum. In fact, I may not even purchase another until the final book is published."
1,This can't be the same series I started reading in 1990,"I could put up with Jordan writing one very bad book (A Crown of Swords) since it could possibly be an exception to the rule. However, the degradation of this series (starting back in Book 6) is now rearing its ugly head. No plot movement, endless and useless descriptions (especially about clothes), weak characters (more like archtype than indicvidual characters). It is strange that since Jordan has taken more time to work on his books, they've gone down in terms of length and quality. Well, I have no choice but to move Jordan off my ""By Hardocver on Sight"" list until (if ever) he returns the series to what it used to be. Here's hoping George R.R. Martin doesn't follow the same pattern."
5,A masterpiece within a masterpiece!,"And when I say masterpiece I mean MASTERPIECE! Sure it didnt tie up al the loose threads but that would be impossible. Its plot developements were startling. Its writing fresh and new(unlike hundreds of other author). And no matter what anyone will say NOT! ripping off of Tolkien. Yes there are similaritys but every author since Tolkien resembles Tolkien(and at least Jordan doesnt passages word for word like hundreds of other authors).I could compare him to Tolkien, to Shakespeare, to White, to Asimov, to Heinlien, to millions of others to no avail because hes BETTER!Anyways returning to PoD anyone who is considering buying it but isnt because of the hard cover price buy it. If you only have thirty dollars left and your about to go bankrupt buy it.As I said before I loved it.To close it up I salute Jordan as the greatest author the world has or will ever see."
3,What was that for?,"I would like to ask why Robert jordan thought to bring out an entire book that seemed like the middle section of one of the other books in the series. POD had no real plot of its own like the other books in the series eg. self discovery for Rand (book 1 &3), Finding the horn of Valere (book 2) and getting the support of the Aiel (book 5). Also, it seemed rather boring in parts. The book is still better than most books, but compared to the others by RJ, it bites.WOT fans: Get it, but be prepared for it."
3,GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!,"Just a brief agreement with everone else. This book reminds me of the movie 'Back to the Future II', where all it did was set up the final movie. I hope all the characters are moving together, so each does not get 100 pages devoted to them and nothing more. This book went nowhere. I hope the next one does."
2,The series is fading,"When I read the first book, I fell in love with the style. I thought it was like Tolkien or Herbert. But the plot has been becoming incomprehensible. Mat was barely metioned, and Nynaeve, once my favorite character, is now no more than a spoiled child. Perrin sits looking at his hands. What was comical five books ago is tiring now. I advise RJ to reread his own books before writing another like this one."
3,"Jordan can do better, this book was an anti-climax.","Jordan focused too much on setting the scene of this book, which was done already in the last 7 books. It was too slow and there wasn't enough to hold my intrest for the whole book, however the ninth book seems promising as there was a lot of build up towards an amazing amount of action."
3,Frustrating to the max,"The wheel of Time series is by far the best series I have ever read, But this last book is completely frustrating. I expected this book to contain a lot more and actually end some of the mysteries involving the characters. but for the most part it contains none of this. I waited 2+ years for virtually nothing. Don't get me wrong I will be one of the first people to purchase the next book when it comes out (hopefully not another 2 years), but it better not be as stagnent as the last two. thanks. you could e-mail me if you wish to dicuss any thought on the thousands of mysteries involving this series. I absolutely love to discuss them"
3,Where is Mat,"This book is written like the other-- several Characters doing several different things at once. But if you like Mat Cauthon don,t buy this one -- he is not in it."
2,I was disappointed by this book,"I had suspicions that book seven seemed to be filler to prolong the series. But after this lastest book, Jordan must be under pressure to write a certain number of books in the series because the pointless nature of this book is incredible. More subplots and very little progression towards the end that must come."
2,What happened?,"A lot of people seem to be reviewing this book based on plot but it's very simple to me. This is the first book in the series that I didn't read a second time. In fact, I read the first couple books over just to remind myself of the magic that was once in the series. I have great faith that the next couple books will be better but the last two have left me wondering if Jordan would have been better off not taking his time. He was on a roll...now, I just don't know."
5,WAKE UP READERS!!,"Quit complaining! If you enjoy the series, what does it matter if it takes 10 or 15 books to complete it. Myself, I think PoD was alot better book than the trash I've been picking up lately. The book is great! I suggest you go back and read the previous books, then you will see how much this book has progressed the series."
2,Pretty disappointing. Downright bbboorrrringgggg!!!!,"Of all the books in the series, ""The Path of Daggers"" was the most disappointing of all. I really enjoy the other seven books, and found them quite engrossing and rivetting, that I read each book several time. This book, however, was real struggle to read. It was boring. I was really disappointed that the plot wasn't going anyway. When I found out that the title of book was tPofD, before the book became available, I thought that Mat would be in the book, since he was only major character to use a dagger. But he was nowhere to be found. The next two books need to be lot better than this one, and plot need to pick up the pace bit, otherwise Jordan will lose even more readers."
3,Where is this series going>>,"Just finished reading the book, and I cant figure out where Mr Jordan is going. I am beginning to believe that he might have NO clue how to end the series, or that he does and the publishers are making him drag it out a few more books. This series is without a doubt the best I have ever read, but I feel it could have been concluded within 6 or 7 books without diminishing the storyline. I hope that Mr Jordan can finish the story strong, to bring back disappointed fans."
2,"Mr. Jordan, please heed my plee!","To: Robert JordanFrom: His frustrated fansMr. Jordan,Less is sometimes better. If nothing significant is happening to a character or group of characters, then please do not waste pages writing about them. I have read all the WOT books, so obviously you have me hooked, but I don't know how much longer I can take it! The plot line that is selling these books is the adventures of Rand and his compatriots, not, those god-awful, boring Aes Sedai characters. Speaking for myself, and every WOT fan that I have conversed with, we would be much happier with a 400 page book that moves along at a reasonable pace than a 900 page monstrosity that, at times, I feel my eighth-grade english teacher is forcing me to read. If you want to keep this series alive for another few books, you're going to have to change your ways or you'll find your fans have fizzled out!"
3,Not the Best Sequel yet,"The Path of Daggers is a good book. I felt that in the Wheel of Time every book improved in some way from the one before it. This one didn't. It still had the action I liked while reading the Great Hunt, but it was very repetitive. This book was a transitional book setting up book nine. It was shorter than most at only about 21 chapters as opposed to over thirty in other books. I have hope that things will improve, Jordan said he thought of the ending of the story before the begining. If not, than we will all know that he is just in it for the money now. But still overall the Path of Daggers is still better than Terry Goodkind."
4,great,I think WOT is the best Fantasy world that I ever read. The characters are described so that you understand why they are doing what they are doing.So many people are coplaining about the the many details but if you read it carefully you see how they hint at future events. I hate waiting for the next book for two years just as much as you do but a 800 Page Book takes some time especially with so many characters and storylines. I can't waint to read the next book.
3,Good Series Bad Book!!!,"I am like all the other WoT fans who have come to expect great things from RJ. His initial concept for a more detailed fantasy series has gotten a bit too detailed and the storyline has suffered. Too many subplots and characters to keep the story line flowing smoothly. Characters are left out, come back to life, stagnant or regressing. Book nine I hope will be a narrowing of plots and characters to get it moving along at a faster than snail pace it's moving now. I don't care how long his Series is as long as the pace doesn't suffer. I don't see him ending this anytime soon though!! Let's hope we don't have to wait 2 years for the next installment! If I have to read another novel of 600 pages to get 100 pages of progress I'll quit until the entire series is finished and in paperback!!!!! Want to discuss e-mail me!"
3,"The Path of Dagars, book 8 of The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordon","A little hard to follow with all the different charaters that I can't remember being in prior books. Well off to book 9, Winters Heart."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"As many reviewers have stated, for this being a WoT book, this had potential for being better than it was. While not terrible, there just wasn't much going on in this book. Mostly planning, and people talking about what they were planning to do, and little action. While not giving spoilers, the end does help set up events for book 9, which was a highlight for this book."
2,Enough is enough is enough...,"I can't go on. The book started off well, but then it crawled to a grinding, boring halt. I don't think I can finish this series now. At least, not the rest written by Jordan. The two written by Sanderson are pretty good. Sorry, Robert."
4,Can anyone see China yet?,"So R.J. releases another book, joy to the world our savior has come.......Eh! I think not. ""Could of been"" is what comes to mind when I read this book, it could have been a classic the book that finally solved the problem of over-plot(when the story gets so big you write a novel set around one week where nothing much happens). We wish we we were that lucky but we're not. Insted we got more plot for our money, so much plot in fact that major players were left out of it completly. R.J. my only advice is to say screw the publishers and write 1000 pages of endings, a sort of 'Return of the Jedi' but only episode 6 of 9 in 'The Wheel of Time'. The fans will wait trust me we've done it before. It may sound like I don't like the book but you'd be wrong to think that, its just that its contributing to a hole being dug by the previous books and giving them more pick axes."
1,"Mo Money, Mo Problems","Mr. Jordan had decided with his latest two books to drag out the story, create new characters, make the old characters do stupid things to make you want to hate them, just so he can generate more income for himself. Does it take over 100 pages for two people to ride a stupid horse to a farm so that they can use the Bowl? Come on, they're on a stupid horse, I can get there faster if I was walking! I really hope that Jordan can tie up this series in the next installment! I don't want to waste my money on another slow and meaningless book. Did anything significant happen in this book...yeah Mr. Jordan made mo money and he gave his fans mo problems."
3,I'd give it 3.33 stars to be more accurate,"The first time I read this book I was pretty disappointed, but the second read showed me that it's not as bad as some people are making it out to be. Just remember that it all fits into the masterplan. There is one major point of contention that I have though: This book is actually very short. If you compare it with the other hardbacks in the series, you'll notice it's shorter in terms of pages and even worse, the font is huge! Compare it to the hardback of Lord of Chaos and you'll see what I mean. It looks like they're trying to deceive the readers. For shame, Tor! For shame, Robert Jordan! Too bad this is the 1500th review and nobody's gonna see it."
2,Major Disapointment,"It took us two years to get HERE? This book doesn't offer much in the way of plot development, and leaves most of the major characters more or less where we found them at the end of Crown of Swords. More than ever before, I felt that this was half a book, padded out with an inordinate amount of meaningless (and often annoying) filler. If the series continues to ""progress"" at this rate, we're looking at a 15 to 20 volume work that Jordan may not live to complete! It's almost as if Jordan is deliberately spinning out this series, because he doesn't have confidence in his ability to create another concept. I'm afraid I've lost patience with this. It's time for Jordan to wrap this series up and move on."
5,The best...,"I think this is the best series I've ever read. I've read Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" but it's not as good as this one. To the sorry people who haven't read it yet: Go to your local book store and buy it, NOW!"
1,Wait for the Paperback...,"Not a whole heck of a lot happens in this book...Rand makes a few appearances, Mat is not in it at all. No big revelations and the storyline barely advances. I think RJ knows his fans will buy the books no matter what he puts on the shelf and will milk this series as long as possible. It came in with a bang but will go out with a whimper."
2,A false dragon,"It seems that Jordan started to believe he is the dragon reborn. However he is not and as a false dragon he should be stilled. Honestly WOT is great, got to its climax around books 5 and 6 but now it is just repetitive and boring; worst it is starting to show the flatness of some of the main characters. Hence please Mr Jordan, a bit of modesty or at least mercy towards your readers, still yourself: cut it short."
1,Jordan's lost the old fastball,"In the world of fantasy there is one series that towers above all others, that being The Lord of The Rings. I always keep searching for a series that will enchant me like LOTR did. The two Thomas Covenant trilogies were brilliant. I had the same hopes for the Wheel of Time series. The first three books were terrific, full of wonderful, vibrant characters and lands. The series has gone steadily downhill since then. Jordan seems to be just going through the motions with Path of Daggers. Nothing happens, just more moronic ramblings by Rand. It's frustrating when potential greatness goes awry. Jordan is slowly descending into hackneyed fantasy hell, along with Eddings, Goodkind and a host of other hacks. This motley bunch would cause a Nazgul to cower in fear. At least we still have George Martin to keep us enthralled with his marvelous A Song of Fire and Ice series."
2,The dud of a great series,"The first 120 pages of this book was the most boring fiction writing I've ever read. Fix the weather with the Bowl of the Winds and get on with the story. Where's Mat? He's one of the most interesting characters in the series. Perrin is one of the dullest. When do Rand and Elayne meet again, the last twenty pages of the series? The ending showed some promise. I hope Taim attacks Elayne in Andor. Maybe the Dark One will finally break all the seals and heat things up a little bit. Maybe the Seachan will attack Tear. I just hope something interesting happens in the next book."
1,There was no 0 star rating,"How bad can it get? Much, much worse. Word is that 11 is the minimum. I have resorted to checking them out of the library and skimming them. My suggestion is that you simply keep book 6 in good condition and, every time he comes out with a new number, you simply read book six again and act like you've read his latest instalment. If you want a long series that goes astray, drags on, but actually ends in your lifetime, try Stephen R. Donaldson."
1,How many more of these things does he expect us to read,"- or where's an editor when you need one! I feel like I've been reading these books forever. From the beginning I thought they were too wordy and could use a good editing. Still I loved the concept and the characters, but enough is enough. Just recently I discovered that I didn't read book #4 - and I barely missed it. I definitely could have missed this one. What a waste of paper. We know the characters - their flaws, their strengths. We know the layout of the world. Let's get on with the story. I hope the next book is the last - if this keeps up much longer, it will be for me."
3,too harsh,"just been reading some of the reviews. way too harsh people. sure this one doesn't spit fire and break speed limits but epic storytelling has a pattern and rhythm. it builds background, character and place as much as burns plot. dramatice conventions of large scale story telling are just not going to give you the 45 minute resolution & pace that prime time t.v vomits up every night. just as well really. check out the difference between the seven samurai & the magnificent seven. both valid and fantastic but completely different dramatic conventions. keep raking the zen garden people and keep your trousers on for the next book. md"
1,Where is he going with this?,"I'm sorry, I'm a huge fan of the Robert Jordan Wheel Of Time Series, but frankly Book 8 is only good for a doorstop. Why did you bother releasing this one RJ? The conclusion of book seven left a lot of unresolved issues that had me eagerly awaiting book eight, i.e. What happened to Mat or Oliver and what about the hints that perhaps Morraine isn't as dead as she appears? I found book eight incredibly slow reading and disappointing, please someone explain to me why RJ would introduce new characters at this stage in the series, without so much as a hint of them beforehand. Sorry Robert, not one of your best efforts, lets hope book 9 in the series goes somewhere, or my collection will go in bin."
1,"A slow-moving, pointless book.","I have recently re-read the wheel of time series and have noticed a steady decline in the quality of Jordan's work. This book is definately the worst. It's like Jordan just threw this book together in a hurry just to appease his publisher. Plus, it seems that Jordan has lost intrest in this series. He wrote a Conan novel while writing a Wheel of Time book, you can't just do 2 books at once and still expect quality work. He needs to conclude this series, and quickly."
3,The climax of a great story,"The path of the Daggers is about a man that who was reborn in a later time. The Man must defeat the person that he and 100 others have imprisoned in a secret place. The guy that is in there is breaking free of the prison slowly but it is giving him time to correct the things he has to in the world before he does escape to give him the greater advantage in the last battle between good and bad. The author of this book is Robert Jordan but his real name is James Oliver Rigney, Jr. He has written the series of the ""wheel of time"" he has also written some of the Conan series. The resins that I gave this book the evaluation that I did is because the book was not as good as the ones that came before it. It took a lot of time for him to get to the point of the story and he went on and on about other caricatures and left some out way too much. Over the entire book was good and I still will read his next on but it needs to be better than the path of the daggers"
1,"I've never read this book, but if I did....","As stated, I've never read this book, but based on the negative reviews I've seen here, I'm sure that I would be ripping tufts of hair out of my scalp in frustration & boredom if I so much as read the 1st page. So, in closing, this book has got to be one of the worst I've never read!"
3,Starting to pick up again...,This series started to wane for me after Book 5 or so...I can't really remember. One good point is that there isn't a million new characters introduced in this book like the previous ones. I hear it's supposed to get better by Book 9 so we'll see.
3,The Wheel of Time trudges on,"The Wheel of Time series trudges endlessly on. Surely it will come to an end. At the beginning the spankings were cute, but grown men and women going through this is not cute anymore. Also the pat phrases about playing with dresses and glares and stares have been common in this series. Because of the length of the series some of the groups of friends and enemies have been forgotten and now are being re-introduced. The daimane are back in this book, but the reader may not remember what they are because they appeared much earlier. The plot is similar to the other books. The Ta-veran Rand al Thor, Matt Cauthan and Perrin are doing something to bring Rand to the cosmic fight. This book does not see Matt, which detracts from it. Rand has been suffering from his mystical powers - again. Won't Mr. Jordon spare him further grief? The Ninth Book has been written but is not yet in paperback. Does anybody know how many books there will be?"
5,Another excellent addition to Jordan's series,"I do not have the limited edition, but have read the Path ofDaggers, and if you have read any of Jordan's previous books in thisseries, you will like this. If you haven't read the series, you should. He has the best character development I have seen, and It is full of clues you will miss during the first reading, but each subsequent time you read the book, you will catch a few more hidden clues as to how the series will end. As far as the limited edition, I asked Amazon.com, and they told me it is A. Limited, and B. Comes with a leather cover. That is what makes it so much more expensive than the others."
1,Hopefully Better Next Time,"In Short: You can skip this volume, pick up the next one and not miss a thing !I've read every volume in ""The Wheel of Time"" epoc and have enjoyed each one until now. As much as I hate to say it, when I finished reading ""Path of Daggers"" I felt I had totally wasted my time!There appears to be gobs of extraneous 'pros' that add nothing to the characterization or plot - an attempt to bulk up the book ? In typical Fantasy fashion, the book splits apart into its seperate story lines, which is fine, except the story lines never reconverge or even interact. Worse, they barely advance the plot at all!If quality of this volume is the future of the remaining volumes then its time to end the series. I wish I could return this book and get my money back plus reimbursed for the time I wasted to read it."
3,Much Better Than Crown of Swords,So much happen in this book. Rand is faced with even more difficulties especially with the seachan invasion and the desertion of the men that can channel. A downside this book is that there are more and more characters to keep track of. This book is definetly not as drawn out as the last book.This book is like a meat and potatoes book. Straightfoward and just plain fun to read.Some of these parts won't let you put the book down.
1,If you are still reading Wheel of Time--STOP,"Honest, the first four books of the series are readable, by book 8 (this book) there are so many characters that you don't care about with descriptions that go into AGONIZING detail about thoughts that you don't care about that the book doesn't even get to the main characters (I think Perrin had one chapter, Mat maybe got a paragraph when someone thought about him)."
3,Only half a book!,"I am die hard Jordan fan and firmly beleive that the Wheel of Time series is far and away the best fantasy series if all time. I read and reread the entire series numerous times. The first six are were spectacular. Each one a complete entity within itself as well as part of the series. But the last two books have been very disapointing. They were both much shorter than the others. I can fogive the Crown of Swords for being short, because it seemed almost a continuation of the Lord of Chaos which was the longest book in the series. But with the Path of Daggers, for the first time in the series, I really feel cheated. I paid for a complete book but only got half a book. It has a great build up with the characters continuing towards a climax but long before it reaches any sort of conclusion...it just arbitrarily ends."
2,another paycheck for jordan,"It seems as if the wheel of time has run out of forward momentum. Nothing happens in Path of Daggers except for more inane bickering between increasingly one dimensional characters. Even the description in the jacket promises action that never happens. This series is beginning to read more like a comedy of manners than serious fantasy . I hope Jordan uses the money he ""earns"" from this book and takes some time off to consider the future of the series. I wouldn't reccomend Path of Daggers, except if you've taken the time to read the previous 8. Wait for the paperback, so at least you won't waste as much money."
1,The never-ending story!,I really liked the first few books of this series but I am sick and tired of the continued plot expansion and little action that has developed since then. After plowing through 600 plus pages of the latest book it occurred to me that nothing of substance happened. END
3,Continues only part of the story.,"I stayed up all night reading this volume once the delivery man finally brought it. However, I must say that I was a bit dissapointed in the content. Actually, the lack of a chapter about Mat is my main critisism. The development of Perrin's adventures and Egwene's march is the best part of PATH OF DAGGERS. I was almost bored with what I consider to be the over emphasis on Rand in this volume. I also, looked in vain for the threat greater than the Seanchan Elayne and Nynaive were supposed to discover. On the other hand, if the next volume follows quickly remedying the lack. I would consider it a fair trade off. But, I feel that we waited too long for too little in PATH OF DAGGERS."
3,Too Many Subplots,Robert Jordan has so many subplots going now in this series that he has little time to devote to any. In 500+ pages he only creeps forward a few days in the story. Almost no memorable events occur in any of the stories. The various plots almost seem unconnected except that they occur in the same background tapestry. Each book in the series has been slower and slower and this one really drags.
1,I'm Done.,"Nothing is finished by this book except for my patience. I don't need to read any more about women smoothing their dresses (at least they've almost broken the habit of tugging their braid.) It's too bad that the author is just stringing out the story, it started out very promising."
2,"FINISH IT, ALREADY!","I BEEN WAITING FOR THE END OF THIS SERIES FOREVER!!!!! Everyone is running around all willy-nilly; nobody's quests are making sense anymore... it's time to tie up those loose ends and bring this puppy back to the kennel! I mean I've been reading this story since 1990! If you don't know how to finish it, for heavens sake- GET HELP!! I lost track of what exactly everyone's part in this saga is... and I think so have the main characters. Let Rand go mad and kill all the Forsaken and bring this psuedo-Norse folk tale to a close, so that fans like me can move on!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"The chicks are doing the more interesting thing here, using the ter'angreal to do their own version of a weather control machine, or at least a weather fixing machine.Rand is involved in yet another large armed conflict, and gets a bit crazy, which ain't good if you were a soldier there, on either side.Easily the worst of these books so far, and a lot of pointlessness."
2,Too Boring,"I used to love this series. I read through the first 7 books in about 5 months and I loved every single one of them. The first book was the best, but the 5th and 6th books have been a drag to get through. The 7th book was good though. I expected the eighth book to be great too, but I ended up getting bored reading it. The story isn't that refreshing and exciting anymore. Maybe the reason that I don't like the 8th book is because my favorite character isn't in it. Matt, by far, is the best character in the entire series. He is funny and entertaining, but he doesn't get that many apperances in the series. Robert Jordan, put Matt in more scenes! I sincerely hope that Matt is in books 9+."
2,This is the book that never ends...,"This is the book that never ends. Yes, it goes on and on, my friends. Jordan started writing it not knowing what it was and he continued writing it forever just because.... If you know the rest of the song, you know how it ends, or doesn't! I started the series enjoying every book. But alas, I now curse the 'friend' who introduced the series to me. Jordan turned one of my favorite characters into a wimpering shadow of herself, and is taken up repeating himself. Has anyone noticed how even the picture of Robert Jordan has changed? I do believe he's a little too involved with his book. Has he taken on the ego of his main character? I'll take up reading his books again when I hear he's winding it up. I just hope he does it before he passes on to the big library in the sky!"
1,path of boredom,"I was looking forward to the continuation of an exciting story that seemed to be slowing down. Instead I found myself in the epithomy of womanhood as perceived by a very macho, egomaniac, superiority complex type of writer. Much to my chagrin I had to leaf page after page reading fake girlish bickering looking for a resoolution of some conflict. Instead all was a mess of events. Did somebody edit the book as to make it more structured? Is Robert Jordan exploring his feminine side and oblitarating it? Is he writing only to fill pages hoping the quality of his first three books will carry him over a few more titles? That, ladies and gentlemen, is what was in my mind at the end of the book, and not at all the fate of any of the characters who have become mere cartoons in a mire of sameness. I only which there were minus stars to rate this book."
2,Losing Interest,"These books are like an addiction. I cannot stop reading them, so for me to say that one was bad is definitly going to take a big disapointment. Path of Daggers is just that. Characters become more one dimensional the more I read, the story goes nowhere. Has Jordan run out of ideas? Does he now know how to end it? Or is he just stretching this series as far as he can to pick up the extra bucks? Whatever it is one more book like this will make me lose interest in Rand once and for all."
2,"Title of book should have been ""Disappointment Reigns""....","It would seem as though all the loyal WoT readers have come to the same conclusion: This book is a 600 page preview to book nine. I myself am torn between wishing book nine to be the last book and not the last one. I would have given this book only one star, except that I thoroughly enjoyed Egwene's catching the Hall in their own trap. For that was the high point. One serious question I have: Will their be a Book Seven 1/2? I guess like all other loyal WoT readers, I will have to wait and see. And wait I shall"
1,What a dreadful disappointment!,"There is no meat in this POD-it's all filler. I feel as if i've been tricked into humming and keeping time until the REAL, next book comes out---and we waited 2 years for this ??"
2,Disappointing from the Master,"This book is the worst book of the WOT series by far. Jordan no longer seems to be able to develop his characters and seems to be writing this book because of contractual agreements with his publishers. The characters are almost forgotten about with Rand eventually making an apperance half way into the book, Matt is almost forgotten about and Perrin is only touched upon. Jordan has let down his fans with this one so lets hope he gets back to form for the next installment."
2,Filler Material for Book 8,"I was very dissapointed, to put it mildly. I have come to expect better things from Robert Jordan, and this book is not of his caliber. It was 600 pages of filler. Mat was never even looked at once! Incredible!The first half of the book was pointless plodding, and introduction of a slew of minor characters we don't need to know about that cloud the issue. The Forsaken had maybe one chapter combined in this book, everything else was so much politics.The second half got a little better, but not by much. It picked things up a bit more, with some surprises thrown in, but it mostly read like a prologue to the next book, especially coming up towards the end.All I have to say is, if Jordan's Book 9 isn't any better than this, you can count me as one less loyal reader, with one less favorite author."
1,a load of rubbish,This book is an absolute load of rubbish. Most of the irrelevant details need to be edited out to create a book half its size. I lost patience with my copy and threw it in the bin in disgust.
3,The marketing beast rears its ugly head,"It becomes apparent in this book that Jordan and Tor are milking their cash cow for all its worth. While we, the public, would like to believe that our favorite authors think only of pleasing us, their eager fans, at the end of the day writing is a business and authors and publishers alike seek to make money. This book makes this truth painfully apparent as the narrative gets very bogged down in dialogue and political plotting, counterplotting, etc. Subplots that have been running for several books still do not reach resolution. Meanwhile, new characters and subplots continue to enter the fray. To be fair, Jordan's series still stands as an epic accomplishment, but you feel a bit hoodwinked when you finish this one. This volume simply just doesn't deliver in the end like the others. Requried reading for fans of the series, but temper your expectations as you approach this one."
3,good but not the best,"This was a good book, but Jordan could have done better. And it was to damn short! Anyway, if your a WOT fan you'd be crazy not to get this book (and if you don't own it by now you where have you been?) and those who aren't WOT fans yet (I say yet because you will be) read the Eye of the World first."
2,Yawn........,"This is a series that started out great and has been going down hill fast in the last couple of books. I thought the first books were excellent and I have read them all more then once, but the last couple just don't have the same quality. That,and the fact that the wait between them is ridiculous in my opinion,will have me reading the reviews before I buy the next one. Hopefully the reason the latest edition is taking so long is because Mr. Jordan is taking the time to do it right,like he did in the beginning."
3,Waiting for #9,"To: Robert Jordan - When should we expect the next book to be published? Admittedly, I am willing to wait for a good product, but I would like to know..."
2,"Slow and, for the most part, uneventful","Jordan's latest is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise amazing series. The plot progression is painfully slow and most of the characters seemed to have learned, matured, and, in fact, accomplished little since the end of the last book. Regardless of the high quality of Jordan's past novels, I found that I was only struggling to finish this one so that I might have some continuity for the next in the series. After the last page of this tedious and sometimes even poorly written adventure, I am not sure that there will be a ""next in the series"" for me."
5,when does the 9th instalment come out?,when does the 9th instalment come out? If anyone knows please post it up here...WOT Rules
3,Path of Daggers,"I have no review, except he hasn't produced anything significant since his first book of the series. And, obviously he's another Stephen King (i.e. The Dark Tower series) that wants us to wait til the end of time for his furture books to finally end the blasted it thing! ."
2,"Well, it was a good series","The Wheel of Time has been one of the most entertaining and engaging fantasy series that I have ever read. Path of Daggers, however, falls short of the high standard Jordan set with the first few books of the series. It seems that Jordan is unable or unwilling to complete a storyline; he jumps from sequence to sequence without resolving anything. While each storyline continues to be interesting, the sheer number of loose threads left hanging by the last three books detract from the story in general. I will continue to read the series, because it has shown so much promise, but this book was a disappointment."
3,First rate book of fluff and filler,"As has been pointed out in previous reviews, (for previous WoT books even), Path of Daggers continues the fabulous story of Good vs Evil, with more than enough ""...folded her arms beneath her breasts..."" and ""...not for the last time, he wondered how anyone could ever understand women..."" This book is something around 700 pages in length, but with careful editing of the bickering and nonsensical chatter, could have been pared down considerably with no loss of plot developement or reading enjoyment. Jordan is a master storyteller. The world he has built is truly awe inspiring and a pleasure to get to know. He knows how to write a climactic confrontation. He also has shown a capacity to slow this series to a crawl and it's a shame. The Wheel of Time HAS slowed to a crawl. 5 American dollars says the fight between The Dragon Reborn and the Dark One goes 12 rounds...er...books."
1,Let's Move the Story Forward,"This book is a continuation of a trend to slow the storyline. Characters that we care about have gotten mired in the growing complexity of the plot. This was an exceptionally vibrant series that I looked forward to the next installment with eager anticipation. Now it is just another series. If The Eye of the World had moved at the same rate as The Path of Daggers we'd still be waiting for our heroes to leave home and of course none of the other volumes would have been published because we wouldn't have cared. I still have hope for the next installment, the story can be saved. Mr. Jordan please listen to what your fans are saying in these reviews. We cared about this story but we are moving away from it."
3,The lowest point in the entire history of the wheel..,"I have been a reader since first buying the Hardcover back in Feb. 1990. This book is the worst in the entire series, leaving many people wondering where this all is going. He was definitaly tired when writing this one, as happens when you write such detail for so long. You can get some info by periodically calling TOR, where you can reach an automated Jordan line. He was supposed to write the entire series in 7 books, but with the success of the series, both he and the publishers had a change of heart. It takes him about 2 years per novel to write, and he was taking a sabatical a short time ago. (gasp!) There is hope! He states he is growing enthused about the series again, and hopes to tie off some lose ends within the next few books. Hang in there, the next few should be a little more satisfying than this one!"
2,Get with the programe,"Mr. Jordan, please listen to the maoning fans who were longing for this book. Listen to the prayers of countless fans to do something with the interesting characters. We hoped for something good and snappy, not for a description of every grassy hill in West-by-South-West Nowhere where a group of non-personality women are walking to a place where they do something at the end of the book what they could've done in a paragraph of the first chapter! This part is not only boring, it is also gut wrenching! Doctor Jordan, don't just stand there, operate!"
1,POD Shocker,"This is the worst book I have ever read. It's the only book I have ever had to chuck in the bin. It's a shocker! I got to about page 400 and had had enough, unfortunately, I chipped the paintwork on my wall where the corner of the book hit it. This author needs a good editor very very badly. Maybe this guy thinks he doesn't need an editor,that every line he writes is pure magic. He's sadly wrong. The book is boring, agonisingly detailed beyond reason and he repeats himself over and over and over again.I can't believe some people are giving this 4 and 5 stars. It should get none! This book could have been written in about 100 pages and that would have been to long. The series looked like it was going to be a classic - what a shame."
3,Jordan is an excellent plotter but a terrible writer,"Prior to reading _Path of Daggers_, I'd come to think of Jordan's series as ""The Wheel of Hay Fever."" Everyone sniffs. All the time. It's the only nonverbal sound they make. With this latest installment, however, Jordan finally decides to mix things up. In _Path of Daggers_, characters sniff *and* snort! The man can't write women, he can't write dialog, and he can't write description. He does, however, know how to construct a good plot and is a master of narrative hooks that hold my attention. Ultimately, reading Jordan is like eating a cheeseburger: it's fun to do, but you know you've had better and you feel slightly guilty afterwards. That said, I'm still holding out for a good harumph."
3,"A disappointment, but I'm hooked so I'll read on.","I admit to being totally hooked on this series, but after waiting two years for this book, was terribly disappointed. It just doesn't have the punch of the first books, as mentioned by my fellow reviewers. However, because I care about the characters, and hope Jordan will get back on track, I'll continue reading...at least one more book. It's like my addiction to Anne Rice, I continue reading long after the quality of the books plummets, simply hoping for the initial magic. A very sad commentary, indeed. PLEASE GET ON WITH IT, ONCE-GREAT WRITERS!"
4,Infuriating,"Path of Daggers did move a bit more slowly than the rest of the Wheel of Time series, but it seemed to me that many of the plot threads advanced leaps and bounds. It was an extremely enjoyable book, and the worst part about it was where it ended."
4,reread the book again,"ok, i like everyone else was very disappointed in jordans lastest addition to the series when I bought it. However, after I read it, decided to go through all over again and start from book one and go on. For the next month and a half I was literally immersed in Jordans series as I picked up one book after another. I got to the last book and it was good. Because I had read it immediately after putting down the seventh the plot was all very fresh in my head and everything fitted together, i know its time consuming but try it, you wont be disappointed"
3,Something is Missing ..... the last half of the book,"I was not disappointed in the way the book read. It was a little slow in parts, but I knew that it was building to the climax, as only Mr. Jordan can provide....but I was disappointed that the last half of the book was missing.Surely the publisher has the second half ready to deliver by mid 1999...."
4,Great Book,I dont know how he does it. His work is great. I started reading the boks about 2 monts befor this one came out. The only reason I didnt read them all in one week is because I couldn't afford them and had to earn money. The only thing I didnt like is the fact that everything happened at the end...it should have been more spread out.
4,Half book 7 and Half book 9,"Gathering up all the weaves? Is Faile going to teach Perrin the Language of Fans? What happened to the fan opening and closeing faster that thought? Is Moraine alive? Who are the Left and Right Daggers? Does Mat take command of the Seachean? Is is he under that wall still? Do Nynevea and Rand clean the Source? The Red Hawk from his Conan books reminds me of Faile, and Perrin could end up being a fully developed Hordo. The Wheel of Time is THE EPIC STORY!I hope no balefire burt any threads out of the ending.."
2,This book is like LAAAG,"I'm a fan of the series, but this one sucked. It is a plug in between books, an attempt to drag out the series to the 10 books Jordan wants. If he didn't keep introducing sh!t it could have been done in 5 books. THAT is a good lenght. The only other author i know of that did 10 is L. Ron Hubbard, and most people finished that just so that they wouldn't wonder what happened to the characters, not to read a finalle to a good seires. That is what I think is going to happen to Jordan.(Expalining the comment above, the lag thing, it's like playing a really good game of quake2 on the net then being interupted by a period where nothing moves, then everything comes back and you find that you've been killed twice.)"
1,This book is the WORST,"This book was terrible in every aspect imaginable. Im done with this once innovative and interesting series. It's turned into worthless drivel. Mr. Jordan, I hope you are happy with the money this drawn-out series is bringing you, because it's costing you the respect of thousands of once-fans of yours before you let this series turn to mush.p.s. What every happened to editors?"
3,Central theme lost amongst too much padding,"Still a good read, but...what has happened to the main theme? Mr. Jordan is getting bogged down with too detailed sidelines. I need a little bit more action and a little less thought on behalf of his characters (and do there have to be sooooo many characters??????)"
3,PoD leads up to one of the great climaxes in the WoT,"Anyone who has read this series from the first book to the current (PoD) can appreciate the subtlety with which Jordan writes. Although this book is not filled with the incredibly exciting events that characterized some of the earlier novels, it is setting up one of the best books in the series. In the next book the war for Tar Valon will happen. Masema will meet with Rand. We find out what happened to the Aes Sedai captured near the Black Tower. This book brought everything to a head and should be considered in the overall story arc as a set up novel. Robert Jordan is doing something that has never really been done before; he is setting up a world that is fully fleshed out. He is creating an ENTIRE world and if some of it seems a little dry at times it is because we all have tendencies to like some parts and not others, but we get the entire world in a nice package if we want it."
5,Keep up the Good Work!,Don't listen to all these other people. Your books are works of art. You give such detail to every moment that happens. Some say it's drawn out but it gives a feeling for the book. I really wish I had the ability to write with such feeling. Thank you and keep up the great work.
2,==-- More like a 604-page prologue to book 9. --==,"You can just tell from this book that Robert is either A) trying to milk the series for the full 12 books, or B) dropping a subtle hint to TOR that he's sick of writing this series. The book was slow, sluggish, and painful. Where I may have finished Lord of Chaos in 2 days, It took me 3 weeks to finish this, having to convince myself several times that I wanted to finish it. It was more of a : ""The sooner you read it, the sooner you won't have to deal with it anymore and you can stick it on your shelf to forget about it."" He spent more time describing horses and cleavage than writing an interesting book."
2,what happened to all of the characters???,"Okay RJ. I like your books. Really. I just can't help getting bored or lost. Even in the 2nd and 3rd books (which I really enjoyed) I could skip a few pages and not miss a thing, but now...I'm kind of confused. I just can't keep up with all of these characters. I always end up looking in the glossary of the old books to identify the returning characters because you went and shrank it when we needed it the most. WHERE IS MAT? WHERE IS MOIRAINE(sp)? HOW COME NYNAEVE IS ACTING SO STUPID? SHE USED TO BE KIND OF COOL. I really love your books JR and you've totally hooked me. Can we have some kind, any kind, of conclusion to any of the little plots now? I'm losing track and, from the looks of the these reviews, lots of other people are too. Your originality is a perfect 10 and I love your intrigue. I just can't keep up with it all. Thanks for the enjoyment."
3,3 just cuz it's Robert Jordan,"It's the same style, it just seems stale. It's nothing compared to Eye of the World, Great Hunt, and Dragon Reborn. It is about as boring and drawn out as Fires of Heaven. Parts of it are cool, yes, but parts of it suck."
1,"A big disappointment: too slow, too boring","The book ""The Path of Daggers"" matches all previous WoT books by it's slowliness. I couldn't even make myself read it to the end."
2,"After nearly three years waiting, what a disapointment!!","I have been reading this series almost since the time when it first came out. I have turned dozens and dozens of people onto the once great epic of ""The Wheel of Time"". Unfortunately Robert Jordan is obviously beginig to milk this best selling series for all it is worth, simply because he knows that people will buy it. What is worth more Mr. Jordan? Money, or your reputation as one of the worlds greatest fantasy authors? Hopefully the next book will come a little sooner, and make a little headway into the plot. I think we have all had enough plot building throughout the first half of the book, and a disapointing end as we saw in the last two books!!"
2,LOSING INTEREST,"I'M STARTING NOT TO CARE ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER - RAND. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THIS BOOK WAS DREADFULLY DULL, DULL, DULL, AND WHEN A CHANCE CAME FOR SOME GOOD ACTION- FIGHTING THE SEANCHEN, THE BATTLE WAS A GENERIC OVERVIEW OF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A SKIRMISH -NOT A ""HUMILIATING DEFEAT"". THIS WHOLE DEAL WITH THE ""CORAMOOR"" NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP. JORDAN'S HANDLING OF THIS AREA HAS NOT BEEN VERY CRISP. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT - WHICH GETS LONGER WITH EVERY BOOK."
2,Duh? Where was I going with that?,"It seems as though Jordan had no idea what he was getting himself into when he started this series. I think that it is apparent that he certainly had no idea how this series was going to really end. Really what has happened here is that he's spread himself too thin. If you're an author you know that you don't introduce charicters, develop them and then never talk about them again. As I was reading this book I just kept thinking to myself ""he's bumbling around... Trying to figure out where he's going."" Think about it, the book took almost an entire year longer than expected and then it just plain sucks! Talk about a writer's block. Anyways, the next book better be good or I'm going to call the publishers and have them refund my money for the first 8 books. Talk about being sucked in"
1,I don't believe the Jordan Comment is real,"Dear Amazon,I don't for a moment believe that Robert Jordan is responsible for the email you have attributed to him. Please check it out, and remove it. This distinguished gentleman, a literate and eloquent writer, certainly can correctly spell ""I'm."" And I'm sure he could come up with something better than has been attributed to him.Thank you."
2,This was a real disappointment.,"Robert Jordan keeps repeating himself!! I'm getting really sick of reading about how tough Rand is, and how cold Lan is. I don't mind a good plot, but nothing at all happens in this book! It's all talk--nobody does anything! Try George RR Martin, or anything, but don't waste your time on this."
3,But nothing really happens,"Another brilliant yet long winded example of how to develop characters oh so slowly. i still found the installment highly addictive but found it tended to get bogged down in matters i felt were trivial and frivolous, when compared to the seriousness of the business at hand awaiting in Shayol Ghul. Im trying not to be negative but couldnt we have had at least one chapter dealing with Mat. The most interesting yet underdone character in the whole story. Path of Daggers is a must for Jordan fans, but ive found friends of mine who are also avid Sci/fi fantasy fans have found the Wheel of Time series very heavy going."
3,Better than nothing,"This book was definitely not Jordan's best - in fact, it was downright putrid. I can't shake the feeling that 400 pages could have been cut out, and the entirety of book 9 inserted, and the book might have been worth something. As is, however, Jordan's worst is still better than many author's best, the charachters are all still interesting, the plot (such as it is) is well laid, and the promise for book 9 will keep me reading for at least one more book."
3,"Path of Daggers still interesting, but....","This is definitely a must read for those who have read the other Wheel of Time books (not that you could stop now if you wanted to anyway right?). However it seemed like a rather long and dull continuation to Crown of Swords which was probably the worst book in the Wheel of Time series. Path of Daggers has slightly more action and it's ending promises a terrific adventure-packed 9th book, but I really missed Mat and Perrin who were seldom mentioned. Some of the characters also faltered by either becoming dull, overdramatically annoying, or in the case of Rand - too unrealistically hard-nosed. It's enough to engross you still, but don't go into it with any big expectations that the story will really move forward from where it left off in Crown of Swords."
1,I was ripped off!,"I believe I have been ripped off by both Robert Jordan and TOR Publishing...This book deserves the title (coined by an earlier reviewer) ""Path of Dollars!"" I will not buy another hardcover from this publisher.Mr Jordan's imagination for this series is obviously exhausted. He has lost the sparkle and enthusiasm of the earlier volumes.To quote another reviewer, the WOT series has become the 'Waste of Time' series."
1,Not up to my expectations,"Jordan did not continue the plots that he had set up in the earlier books, and instead laid new ones out. He, as most have said, could have written it in about 1/10 or less of the pages he used. It seems as if he is just trying to make people buying the books to find out what happens instead of doing it to continue the story. It lacked very much but if you have been following the series then you should but it just so you learn the little bit that he reveals."
3,This book is fair.,"Path of Daggers, the eighth book in the series Wheel of Time, was a disappointment. After waiting for more than a year, I had hope to read a good book by Robert Jordan. Instead, this book turned out to be just fair. There was too much talk and enough action. The events described in the previous volumes just seemed to drag on and on."
1,Garbage!,"The only reason I gave it a star is cause you couldn't give a negative rating. Geez! I could say this all in two words--Where's Mat? My favorite character has disappeared off the face of the earth! The plot goes nowhere! The only thing new happening is there's a snow storm and Rand's going mad. I was SEVERELY disappointed by this junk. Frankly, I got more out of reading the dust jacket than the book. The plot goes nowhere, only leads to more complexities, and nothing is cleared up. AND WHERE'S MAT? You leave him dying and maybe captured by Seanchan, and everyone's hanging onto what's going to happen, and DON'T EVEN MENTION HIM! I was lucky I got this book at the library instead of wasting money on buying it. Frankly, the only use I can see for it is to burn it. The other seven books were wonderful; this one, a five -year-old could have written better. If number Nine is like this, I'm stopping reading Jordan for once and for all, and he's lost a formerly great fan."
1,This series was going nowhere from book four,I think RJ is spending more time on Computer games and other stuff to give a hoot about his books but he ceeps churning them out for more money.DONT BUY THIS BOOK (or any of them for that matter)You will just get hooked on a story that starts great and ends (if it ever will end) as a pathetic scam
1,Booooring...,"I made myself finish the book hoping something would eventually happen. Nothing ever did and this book was a HUGE waste of time! Nothing was learned nor resolved. His last two books were getting worse but this one has gone WAY over the edge. It's obvious Robert Jordan is just dragging this series out so we'll all keep buying his books. Well, I don't think I'll be buying any books from Robert Jordan in the future. The first few books in the series were excellent. They were action-packed and I couldn't put them down. His last few have been hard to pick up! It's time the whole story was ended already!!!"
1,absolutely boring,"why are the characters so childish and behaving like morons. With so much death and destruction over the span of 8 books, any village idiot will come to understand what's going on. I have lived and breathed on your series for the last few years and unless you do justice to the tale, the characters and to yourself, you will most definately lose your fans. Let's get on with the show with more action and substance rather than the inane and irritating bickering that the path of daggers is all about."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"A story has a beginning, a middle and an end. For the WoT series we've got an 8 book begining, no middle and no end in sight. This book has 600 pages of character development. It has no plot and does nothing to advance the over all storyline. A storyline which has become so bloated that I'm not sure Jordan will ever be able to resolve all of the plots and sub-plots. If you're hooked, wait until it's out in paperback, or better yet wait until it's in the library. If you haven't started the series, DON'T. Personaly I don't intend to buy another WoT book until Jordan finishes the series, assuming that ever happens. For now I give PoD and the WoT series zero stars."
1,"God, Please let it end.","Do not buy this book. If you have to because like me you got hooked on the previous books, wait for the soft cover. Send the difference in price to your favorite charity. I bet you'll feel that your money was better spent."
2,Path of Daggers Disappoints,"While I love this series, I did not like this book. Jordan spent too much time describing how foolish and childish Nynaeve has become with her constant pouting & worrying over Lan -- 50 pages of this would've been more than sufficient rather than the 500 to which Jordan subjects the reader.I agree with many of the other reviews that Vol 8 fails to advance the series. The ending lacked any drama -- Egwene's troop should've strung her up by her heels if she'd decided to trek across the face of the planet rather than to Travel to Tar Valon. Instead, everyone thought her decision to Travel some suprising stroke of genius. Let's see, drag an army across 1000 miles of snow & ice or get there in an instant, REAL tough choice.I can't believe I waited 2 yrs & paid the hardcover premium for this book. While I'll read #9 (if it ever comes out), I will not buy the hardcover."
3,RJ is tired of this series and so am I.,"When I finished waiting for and reading WOT 7 I began to harbor the feeling that RJ might be getting tired of writing this series. Now after waiting for over 18 months for WOT 8 and finding it the least satisfying of all the books my inital feelings are confirmed. RJ is taking longer and longer to complete a volume and there is less and less in it. I believe he is not as dedicated to finishing this series as he once was. Taking into consideration the trend set over the past years I figure WOT 9 should hit the presses sometime around Fall 2002, with larger type, fewer pages and less interest on the part of everyone."
3,I want book 9 now!,"After putting down Path of daggers, I wanted the next book. Not because I was wanted to start book 9, rather to finish book 8. It left too much hanging. Mr Jordan needs to finish this series and go onto another, maybe the decendants of Rand."
2,Unfullfilling,"Robert Jordan is my absolute favorite writer. His ability to perfectly translate what his characters are thinking and feeling on to common paper is, to me, amazing. I must have read the first six books a dozen times. The last two though, and in particular The Path of Daggers nigh on put me to sleep every time I looked at them. Jordan alienated me from my favorite character,Rand, by making his actions and thought prosses so distant from those he had in the other books. It was as if someone else stole into Jordan's office and ruined the most important character in the book. Also, almost NOTHing was said about Mat, my second favorite charater. So, all-in-all, i'd have to say that this book failed to deliver the kind of story we all expect from Jordan. Especially after making us wait for close to TWO YEARS for it."
2,"""Too many boulders to a false summit""","Reading this latest episode reminded me alot of climbing a mountain made up entirely of very large boulders that are both tiring and tedious to climb over.It is obvious that Robert Jordan knows his stuff, but the episodes are beginning to read like the scientific journals that students have to plod through for their extra credit papers. Even the beginning of the ""Wheel of Time"" series was very detailed with considerable jumps from one situation to another, but the whole of the story was distinct. I found it an engaging read once I ""got into it"". The problem is I no longer can get into it. I am eager for this author to finish the sequence and to write something fresh with the engrossing qualities found in ""The Eye of the World""."
2,Slow start,"I'm 100 pages in Path of Daggers and slogging painfully through it page by page. I thought I'd check with my fellow Jordan fans to see if this is a shortcoming of mine. Apparently not. Reading time is too precious to waste on something so unsatisfying, but if it's a part of the big picture, I may have to slog on. What to do, what to do..."
3,Going on forever,"If the rest of the books follow suit to The Path of Daggers, we are in for a long series. While I was disappointed in the fact that my favorite characters, Matrim and Perrin, were hardly mentioned, the writing of Robert Jordan is such where I truly don't want the tale to end any time soon. The number of characters and their roundness is something to be amazed over. I have the money and the time to read them, I only hope I am still alive when the Wheel of Time concludes."
2,You can't hit a homerun every time.,"After an eternity of wait the eigth installment of the world of time series has got to be the worst out of all the books in the series. I remember thinking when I recieved the book I wanted to finish as soon as possible. After the first hundred pages it was a pain to keep reading it, I put it down and forgot it for a few weeks and finally got around to reading it. It was a chore to read and I think that RJ is beginning to think it's a chore to write. If your a fan you hope the next will redeem the series. If this is the first book you read in the series, please don't let it stop you from reading the greatest series of all time."
3,A Necessary Ebb in the Flow of a Great Long Story,"I've been reading a lot of the comments of other readers of WOT saying that Path of Daggers sucks. I think those who are true fans of this series need to look at this installment again. Granted, it does move slowly, and I agree that there are too many women tugging their brades. But a story this long cannot always be moving 100% full force forward. Besides, this is a good book, especially the development of the Asha'men and Cadsuane. It was very intersting to me that the next to the last chapter was titled ""Beginnings."" So for you who hated this one, the next will undoubtably be everything you're looking for in action packed adventures."
2,Actually two hundred pages short!,"TPoD is the most disappointing of the WoT series because it had potential that did not get realized. The Rebels v. the Red Tower, the Black Tower v. the Aes Sedai, the unification of the Borderlands under the Dragon banner, the (probable) abduction of Mat to Seanchan; all these plotlines were left dangling but at least some should have and could have been, to a degree, resolved. This chapter also had the weakest ending of any of the WoT books, weaker even than ACoS. If you're going to write the longest fantasy epic ever, put some more meat in it as we head (hopefully) toward a conclusion."
3,Better than Crown of Swords but not as good as the first 4 .,"I began reading this series while I was stationed in England(1980-1988) and I had hoped it would have climaxed by now. I feel Mr.Jordan has been infected with the same disease our sports ""heros"" have, ""GIVE ME MORE MONEY"". Although I'm still a fan and I did enjoy reading ""Path of Daggers"", there are still too many unresolved issues to keep the story line flowing. Please return to your original form where everyone was saying how you re-invented The World of FANTASY and how you would be replacing JRRTOLKIEN as the BEST OF THE BEST."
1,Disgusted,"Like many of the other Jordan fans, I was anxiously anticipating the arrival of this book, only to find that it was a waste of time and money.The storyline positively stagnates. There was nothing in this book that required an entire book to be written about it. This book was about 600 pages worth of bun, but ""where's the beef?"" Where was Mat for that matter? (not that having Mat in this book would have saved it, but it might have enhanced it in some ways)I can only hope that in the remainder of the series Jordan can recapture that special !umphh! in his writing that drew his fans to this series in the first place."
2,"Yes, enough is enough","I agree with a previous reviewer, who said Enough is Enough. This is the last book I'll read in this series. Nothing happened in this book. Even if you plan on reading the following books in the series, skip this one.Read the fantasy series by Terry Goodkind, instead. It's far superior."
3,"Skip #8, go on to #9","I suggest going straight from #7 to #9. You won't miss any important plot points and will simply skip the only disappointing book so far in a great series.The only reason I don't rate it lower is because it is a continuation of one of my favorite series and came out quickly. The truth is I'm worried about Jordan's writing. His subplots have always been good, but in this book he introduces at least half a dozen more and ties up only one old one. This pattern has been continuing for 3-4 books now. And one of the Three MAJOR characters (MAT) doesn't appear even ONCE in this book after the author left him hanging in the middle of an invasion in book 7. That lacks class. I'm going to buy the 9th book anyway - he didn't have to do that."
2,Get on with it!,"I loved the first 4 books, but the writing in the last two books almost seem as if a ghost writer has moved in. If Jordan continues making his women so ridiculous, stupid and cruel, I may never read past the next book. Does Jordan have an ending in mind or is he just going to keep making all women dispicable, all men crazy and introducing more boring characters that go nowhere?"
3,Could have been better.,"This is still a good book written with Jordan's superb style. However, I expected far more, because this whole series is getting rather lengthy with no end in site. Again, Jordan spins far too many plot threads without resolving much in this book. I get the feeling this will go into book 16 or Jordan may die before he can finish it. What an irony that would be for the rabid WoT fans out there. I was extremely disappointed by the fact Mat Cauthon's adventures were completely set aside. Someday he has to marry the Daughter of the Nine Moons (Seanchan). I was just as disappointed when Jordan neglected Perrin a few books ago. In fact, without Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon, I wouldn't give this series the time of day. I know they're not entirely central to the story, but they do make the books far more enjoyable where I find Rand rather boring these days."
2,Dissapointed that the plot does not advance,"While not one of Jordan's better efforts, this book has the virtue of being better than Crown of Swords. Jordan focuses on what he does best - political intrigue. The characters become richer, and new twists are added to the plot, but it's getting a little frustrating that nothing has been happening for basically 2-3 books now. Elayne makes it to Caemlyn, but there is at least another books worth of politics while she gains the throne. Perrin does next to nothing in this book. How long has Egwene been tramping toward Tar Valon? Who is Mat again? If you accept the fact that Jordan plans to keep this series going for 20-30 books, you can enjoy it. If you are hoping that he would finally advance the plot line, you will be very frustrated. Do you really expect him to move any faster in book 9?"
2,Not getting any better...,"I only read this book because a I like the overall series, (or at least the first 6 books), I really hate Nyanave, she's very irritating and hypocritical, and after reading the series 3 times, she's even more anoying than ever. I don't really mind that the series is so long but to wait a year and a half for each book is ridiculus and when the book does arrive it's not up to the previous standards is disapointing.All his female charachters should stop sniffing all the time. Please don't put Jordan in the same league as David Eddings and Terry Goodkind, those guys were such ""child - young adult"" writers.I do like Jordan I gave the whole series 5 stars but he just lost it in the last 2 books and i hope he will get better, but realistickly don't see it happening. Get the story moving already Jordan. I'll still read the next one the sucker that I am. Excuse my disorganized writing but didn't feel like writing any better for you guys."
5,Jordan is l33t,"There's no other way to put it.Robert Jordan is the master, he's creative, inventive (my god, the part where Elayne gets shielded and an a-bomb goes off, that was -- rapture) very few authors can spell-bind me like Jordan can, and he's done it again. While I can't really put this book on level with The Shadow Rising (my fav), it is certainly well above LoC and aCoS, the best time I've had in a long time. RJ can do it like no-one else, (and although Terry Goodkind tries as hard as he can to knock him off, he can't compare)"
5,Forever addicted,"I've read and re-read this series more times than most people would consider sane. I cannot help it. It shades just about every aspect of my life. And it distresses me that anyone can put it down. A Path of Daggers isn't the best book in the series, but I wasn't disappointed and put off from the series itself. Every time I read the WoT I find something new, which helps wave off my short attention span. I will recommend the Path of Daggers to anyone who will listen."
2,What happened?,"I have loved all of the books in the Wheel of Time series, but what happened with this one? Only the last quarter was Robert Jordan in true fashion. The first 3/4 was dribble. This could have been one of the most interesting of the series, but he blew it. I hope he's more focused with the next one."
1,Worst Yet,I just finished this book and I feel that it was the worst Wheel of Time yet. I was immediately hooked by The Eye of the World and obsessively devoured each book since then. Halfway trough this book I was bored to tears. Absoutely NOTHING happens in this book. My favorite carachter Mat is only breifly mentioned. The plot goes absolutely nowhere. Get on with it already Jordan. I'm starting to wonder how long this series is going to on. At this rate I think we're looking at at least 12-15 volumes in this series if the plot keeps advancing at this rate. None of the major plot points are even addressed. Before I started reading this book I actually said to myself that Egwene better realize Halima's true Identity or I would be very disappointed and sure enough I was. If I hadn't ivested so many hours(and so much money)reading the other seven I'd Have quit halfway through. Iexpect alot more from the next edition.
4,"Not full of action, but still worthy of Jordan","Shame on everyone who is saying that because of this book you will never read the WOT series again. After writing seven of the best fantasy novels ever you are now so quick to drop him because this last book didn't ""move fast enough for me."" I will admit that not as much action took place in this book as in the last seven, but it wasn't ment to be action filled. This books perpose was to futher the plot to the next leval so that when the ninth book comes it will be great. Robert Jordan has established such interesting plots and characters that he needed to use this book to stop and sum up all of the story lines to get them ready for the big event, which is obviuosly coming in the next book. In my opinion Robert Jordan is still one of the best authors writing today. And to all of you with short attention spans who need continuous action on every page I am sorry that you are going to miss the last books in the best fantasy serious ever."
2,Move the Story Along,"Having seen other reviews, I was prepared for the worst. I bought the book anyway and read it on a plane. It was not as good as some of the earlier stories, but was still interesting. Jordan really needs to pick up the pace by either writing faster (2 more year wait?) or move the story along. I just can't wait until 2010 for the last book."
4,Others have been a little harsh.,"I love the wheel of time series and this is the weakest in the series. Not because it is badly written but because it is incomplete, the first few chapters should have been in a crown of swords and the book should at least have had a definate ending like the rest of the series, I felt I had read half a book. Despite those faults it is very good and a lot of important things happen. I hope a winters heart resolves a lot of the hanging threads this book leaves as there are so many. Is Rand coming down with the wasting sickness what will happen to Faile. Will Gawyn stand with or against Egwene. And most importantly where is Matt. Path of daggers is excellent its also very irritating, roll on november"
2,takes dogged determination,"Way back when Robert Jordan started this series with Eye of the World, it was great reading. A truly original, epic fantasy. I continue to plod doggedly through these dogs, trying to get to the conclusion, but really I'm going on sheer determination to finish the series now. I'd recommend Eye of the World very highly to any fan of epic fantasy. I frankly have forgetten where the series dropped into intellectual neutral, but I think the next two or three books were pretty good. After that though, you've got to be prepared for some tough going."
3,I just wish something would happen,"I agree with the often voiced opinion that the Wheel of Time series is well written and based in an interesting and complex fantsy world. However, I find that the books move a little slow for my taste. Not that I could stop reading them (they are addictive), because of the novel subject of the ""one power"" and the world that it resides in. This is not to mention the characters that I have come to idetify with over the course of this series. So, overall I have enjoyed this series I just wish that Jordan would pick up the pace."
1,A review from someone who WON'T read this book!,"Thank all of you for saving me from wasting many useful hours of my life on more of Jordan's plodding work! I am glad I read the reviews before I went out and bought it... I am so sick of his characters, especially the annoying man-hating women. If you want to read a good fantasy book, drop Jordan and check out:Rhapsody: Child of Blood (by Elizabeth Haydon) or A Game of Thrones (by George R.R. Martin)You'll see from everyone's reviews on Amazon.com that these books are well worth your time!Do what I did - kick the Jordan habit! You'll respect yourself more if you never read another WOT book =)"
2,Nothing Happens,"What can I say? Nothing happens. Unfortunately, this is the Jordan standard now. Don't look for anything more after this. Only us psychos keep hanging on."
2,"You may read this book once, but probably never again.","The Wheel of Time series keeps rolling, but never gets anywhere. But what is worse is that when you get to the end of one of the books you really don't feal any desire to pick it back up and read it again. I have read Lord of the Rings I don't know how many times, and will probably read it again. But having read every one of Wheel of Time books I feel little if any inclination to read any of them again. This seems to get worse as the series goes on. The books are long, and nothing happens. You are tantalized with hints and fore shadowing galore, but in the end you right back where you started."
1,Jordan streches our Imaginations and his Purse,"I am a great fan of the Wheel of Time series, but Path of Daggers is without a doubt the slowest and possibly the worst book in the series so far. It dodders, stumbles and falls flat on its face mainly because about two incidents of any note take place in this story. The rest of the book seems to be just rubbish where nothing of any import is happening to fill up gaps. I think this was the reason the book seemed so laborious and slow-going. The story-line gave a feeling of being artificially stretched and the style of writting seemed different too. It was bleaker and there was a distinct lack of humor unlike in the rest of the series. I must admit the ending was rather promising but apart from that it seems Jordan is streching the story for the sake of streching it now."
2,Guilty Pleasures,"Perhaps this is more of a commentary on the state of fantasy than the quality of Path but I quite enjoyed Jordan's latest . I would like to see more coherant plot development and dread the ever increasing liklihood of falling into the Star Trek syndrome (The rush to tie up all the loose ends in the final 1000 pages - give or take an order of magnitude). But, I got my moneys worth (In hardcover even). As an admited fantasy junkie I'll keep buying until my friends perform an intervention. But, hey, It could be worse. i know people that actually like Steven King."
2,Worst WoT book Yet,"I started reading this series about two months ago, and got deeply hooked in the first few books. Then, the quality degenerated rapidly. The novels got shorter, and the plot development by page went down. Trivial matters are given dozens of pages while the important issues are either put into a paragraph or stretched out beyond belief. If you've already started, you might as well read to this one, if anything will put you off the series, this is it. If you haven't read WoT, I would recommend you read the first book, then stop there since the ending is conclusive, and you won't have to read through the pages of drivel inherent in the later novels."
1,Give me a break,I am an avid fan of the wheel of time series and literally drove the local bookstore owner mad asking when this item would be relaesed so you can imagine my disapointment upon reading it.This book does not add anthing new to the story nor does it resolve anything. After seven books building up the story I am starting to wonder if Jordon is just going to string us along forever or if he is going to give us the monumental disapointment found in another (lets not name names) that builds up the story over a number of volumes and resolves 30 years of plot in a single final chapter.While this book might be good in itself as some people have suggested. Fans such as myself know that it is a huge let down of Jordan's usual standard.
3,Well thought out series take time!,"Creativly, path of daggers is a Tyson haymaker compared to most of the other weak jabs of writing in the fantasy genre. This book tends to get a bit overworded but the style of writing is definatly A-plus. No fantasy series I have read save Tolkien and Brooks has kept such a rigid credibilty over twice as many novels.Understandably, Jordan has written a transitional book, having to step down the action over need of literal integrity. However looking at some of the development of the characters, the book maintains a subtle detail that all the fans enjoy. The maintenence of the detail over a harsh demand from the fan base is astounding.Shame on you fans who discredit the writing! If you need a better idea of how clever a writer Robert Jordan is, take a better look at how Rand goes through his personality merging. Even if the plot is a bit slow, the writing is fundamentally fabulous!"
3,Not as bad as they say . . .,"Having only started the series in Dec1998, the story was fairly fresh in my mind when I picked up this paperback. While I find the entire series very entertaining (this one included) some things did start to annoy me:For one thing, all of the 'cold' attitudes and remarks; it's a wonder the heatwave was a problem at all;The lack of Mat, one of the more interesting characters;The betrayal of the Asha' man, where'd that come from?And lastly, the lengthy descriptions of EVERYTHING in place of action scenes that might advance the story some.Overall, there is a lack of story structure in this book that previous ones had -- a beginning, a middle, and an end. The whole end part with Rand felt tacked on to give the book some action. It isn't enough though.I didn't have to wait two years for book 8, so my expectations were not as high, maybe that's why I found it passable. It might lead to something big in the next book (hopefully)."
2,It's only getting worse...,"I have always enjoyed this series, but this book has almost pushed me over the edge. I'm seriously considering not buying any of the rest of the series. The first 3 books were good; the second 3 were acceptable; and the rest have been a waste of the paper they were printed on. Save yourself the expense and just wait until your local library is throwing their copy out in another 5 years, if you're desperate to read it.Of course, I'm aware that if you're reading the reviews of a book that is 8th in a series, you've probably already read the others and are addicted. But I think you'd be better off spending your money joining a twelve-step program to overcome your addiction to Robert Jordan than you would be buying this book. Don't do it!"
4,"Welcome back, Jordan!","Because of its predecessor, I, like many fans, was hesitant to buy ""Path of Daggers"". However, the series has been so good up to ""The Crown of Thorns"" that I had to have more of the story. Reluctantly, I shelled out the cash and was pleased to find that Jordan is on the move again, albeit a little jumpy. As with the first six books, I spent many late evenings in the Wheel of Time.Great character chemistry is back and the Tower has taken on a great side plot. My only complaint is the ""soap opera"" scene layout. The book really bounces around. Some of this probably has to do with so many side spins ( the wheel weaves, you know), but for the ""first time"" wheel reader, it may be difficult to keep up.My advice, if you're thinking on buying ""The Path of Daggers"": If you have read this far, you have to continue-it's worth it. If you are new to the Wheel, start from the beginning and read them all. Welcome back, Jordan! From a Fan renewed."
3,Love it or hate it?,"While I certainly did not have time to read all 1700+ reviews, the few I did were either 5 stars or 1 star. Love it or hate it.My opinion lies in the middle. I certainly cannot condemn the book, as having just finished reading it I enjoying it. However, it is not a classic by any means and cannot compare favorably with Tolkien.Characterization? If you call all female characters complaining about how stupid men are and vice versa, then it has characterization overflowing. In fifty years if people still talk about Rand maybe I'll change my tune.What it does offer is twists and turns, the plot does move forward (though far enough?) and if you have enjoyed the rest of the series you will enjoy this one. Just don't read all the books back-to-back. Balance them with something different."
2,Frightening continuation,Frankly if you haven't started this series DON'T it isn't worth the irratation. After much thought and having reread of the entire series I find this book very disturbing. The writing itself is about on par with the rest of the series but it seems there is little chance this series will ever end. This is largely because for every piece of plot development there are two new twists or subplots developed; after eight books this is ridiculous. The lack of resolution makes this a very disappointing book. One has to wonder if the author has any real design or overall plan in mind.
2,Did I really need to read this one?,"The question that I keep asking myself is why did I keep reading. I have enjoyed most of the books of this series, but I found this book tedious with no real reason for being. Nothing happened."
2,And the story is...,"It would appear that Mr. Jordan is letting the Wheel of Time go 'round and 'round. It's time to either change the wheel or let it come full circle. It's been fun and exciting, but this one has a few broken spokes. I must agree with previous readers...it's not what I had expected and I'm truly disappointed that there wasn't some conclusion to any of the mini-dramas. Even the ending was so so."
3,The Path of Daggers,"The series is great, this book is so-so. I think he is building up to something. Plus I think the 3-star rating is a bit skewed. If you look at the end of the reviews you find alot of 5-stars from people who hadn't even read the book. Hmmm... Maybe we should rate it with 2 instead."
2,I'm disappointed yet still eager for the next book.,"I read the book before reading a single review and am sad to say I agree with the general feelings about this book. We can't all be wrong Mr. Jordan. After reading it I was very disappointed. Seemed like nothing more than an 800 page set up for the next (and hopefully better) book. Sadly I would have gotten as much out of it to just read a brief synopsis of the plot and saved myself some money. And for God's sake do something about the cover art, not to mention the pitiful illustrations of ""The World Of"" book."
2,The series continues to slow...,"I expected to be disappointed with this book, and was. The series gets progressively worse with each book, with nothing noteworthy happening in the eighth volume. Sometimes I think the only reason I continue to read them is because I already have so much time invested.Hardly anything of importance takes place in this book. Mat, one of the central characters from the series, despite being in a precarious situation at the end of volume seven isn't written of at all. The only good thing is there's much less rehashing of prior events than in past volumes.I come away feeling ripped off after a lousy book with a lousy beginning, middle, and end. The book makes me want to say ""blah, blah, blah""! Jordan cheapens himself as the money continues to roll in."
2,There is no end in sight.,"I like Robert Jordan's writing, but this is too much! What happened to the plot? In his last couple of books, almost nothing has happened! The first three books in the series were masterful, but now, I get the dreadful feeling that Jordan is merely trying to milk it at the expense of his series. A book needs to tell a story, on its own, and this book, like his last three, failed to do that. He needs to remember that these should be stand alone novels, each linked to one another, yet having a plot, a theme, a climax, and a conclusion all on their own. He, like David Eddings, seems to have lost his edge and his imagination. Only his characters and writing ability have kept me to this series, but to be honest, I am running out of patience. End it!"
1,Pathetic,"Boring, cliched, derivative. The first few books in the WoT series held marginal promise, but PoD is ridiculous. For literate, intelligent Fantasy, try an author like George RR Martin or Stephen R. Donaldson."
5,Robert Jordan has produced a GREAT work of fiction!,"I am in awe of R.Jordan. He has created a world with such detail and definition that it is believable. When I pick up his book at night, I am quickly engrossed in Andor and forget I am on earth in my bed. To a author of fantasy, I would see this as the ultimate in compliments. No other book has given me what Jordan has in this series. Thank you"
2,a little disappointing,"This was definitely not very fast-paced. I was very excited about it at first, but it left way too many of my questions unanswered."
4,I may have not read it but...,"OK, Joradn wrote over 10 thousand pages in all these books. I understand why he is maybe getting sick of it. I believe he can slow down if he wants, take his mind off for a month or two. Then get back to it with a renewed power to write his books as good as he has been! So give him a break so he can renew his interest in the stories. Although I do have to still read Path of Daggers and hope he continues the whole story to the end."
1,It took how long to write this?,"This series started off so promising, but it gets worse with each book. The plot lines do not advance, its just a bunch of people jumping from place to place. The main characters never grow. If they are in the book at all. How can you write a book and not have one of central figures in it, did Matt get abducted by aliens and taken to another planet? Jordan writes like he has no idea where he wants to go or is just bored with the whole thing. Maybe he since he made his millions he just doesn't care any more. He is called the great one and the master and other such lofty titles but a master who takes two years to write a book should put out a better product than this. I am thankful for libraries so i don't have to waste money buying these books. I don't care when the next book comes out because i am through with this series."
1,Do not start this series!!,"Terrible book! Jordan has build an incredible world, but does he have the ability and desire to do something with it? The problem with this book is not that nothing happens, but that you care less and less about what happens to anyone as you read it. I started out interested in what had happened to Matt, but after finishing, felt that he was probably better off not being in this book. I certainly wish that Rand, Minn, Perrin, Ny. had not been in it."
1,I'll bet the final book will disappoint...sometime in 2037,"For anyone that is still reading because you got hooked on the first five books (which were fairly good), you're probably wondering when something important is going to happen again. I say, stop reading. I won't buy another book in this series. I predict the final book will be a major disappointment. Some of us are still slogging along through the volumes because we're hooked, and hoping for an exciting resolution, and for all the answers to be revealed. I don't think it's going to happen. How could the series possibly get better, when Mr. Jordan has written 3 terribly boring books in a row? Mr. Jordan is just making a career out of this series, and taking us hapless readers on a very bad ride."
3,"Ok start, but lacking","In the grand tradition of Robert Jordan books it is a contiuation of a great story, however this has been the worst story yet. Several main characters or groups were left out and it lacked the great moments of tention and suspence. Overall it was disaponting, but bein g a die hard fan of Robert Jordan. I will stick this series till the end."
3,Path of Daggers weak but worth reading...,"Sure, not much new has happened, but being with Elayne and Perrin made it worth it to me. Tor did a poor job of copy editing the hard-cover version of this one, though. There were over 5 pages where the mistakes stopped my reading enjoyment.I love WOT because it is rich and full and puts the minute details in front of the readers. And I think WOT has been far better than Tolkien for a long time. I agree with some other readers that a smashing conclusion would be nice, but like King's Darktower series, I don't care if it never ends as long as I can continue to spend time with the characters."
2,TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Book #8 in the Wheel of Time series was a terrible disappointment to me. Turgid prose, actionless, no plot development. Perhaps when an author gets very successful, the publisher may give him/her free rein and not bother the ""genius"" with any editing constraints. I certainly will not order Book #9 before publication--in fact, I think I'll wait for the paperback version, even if it's not 'til 2005. My holiday season was only saved by being able to get George R. R. Martin's ""A Clash of Kings"" from amazon.co.uk--now THERE is a guy who can write!"
2,Jordan's done better.,"Jordan seems to be facing several problems right now. He seems to be working hard to establish several situations which (hopefully) will pay off in the next book or two. Unfortunately, they don't pay off now. The Seanchan invade. Egwene prepares to fight the tower. Rand struggles with his sanity while facing terrible choices between what he wants to do and what he needs to do to survive. The Dark One prepares to attack. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Been there, done that. The really sad thing is Jordan's recent prequel novella, ""New Spring,"" published in Legends, managed to push the plot further ahead. Want to know how firmly entrenched the Black Ajah really is? What was the question only Moraine could answer for Lan? What happened to the other Malkieri survivors? What is Cadsuane after? Who might that new forsaken in POD be? If you want a lot of fight sequences and a bit of plotting and angst, read Path of Daggers. If you want to know what's going on, read New Spring."
3,"Jeez, people, please.","OK, 3 star rating. I agree, it wasn't his best. In fact, it was far from his best. I get really tired of people whining about this and that about the book. You know, I really doubt that people want to the read the same old ""Oh, PoD was an absolute stinker, he's just milking the series for money."" If that's how you truly feel, stop right there. Don't post a thing, don't ever touch a Wheel of Time book again. You don't deserve the story that RJ's been weaving for us.PoD was like an oversized prologue. If you read any of RJ's prologues, you'll get a flavor for what PoD is like. Developments left and right, but not much action. If you really think about it, dishing out a book every year while keeping the same quality is HARD. Give him a break on this one. Perhaps book 9 will complete the prologue that book 8 was."
2,IT SUCKEd,"there was no plot to it, and the characters...where was matt? i tihnk i maybe at max read 3 pages on him throughout the whole boook, NOTHING HAPPENED!! and u know what? his last two books have been his worse YET!! in the last one it took him 900 pages to say he got one morel ittle kingdom, at least then he said something and there was a plot, but not this time this novel SUCKED and to think that i had paid 25$ for it just pisses me off more"
3,Just One Thought,"The three-star rating is an act of compromise, since I haven't actually read the latest installment of this vastly bloated series. Because I neither wish to nor am able to devote the entirety of my free time to Mr. Jordan's world, despite its initial promise, I had to leave it behind in the fifth book. Judging from the recent reviews here, not much has changed. What a concept: write a neverending story, charging handsomely for each installment and playing off of both readers' hopes and their feeling that, having gone this far, they might as well finish the journey. Goodness, Tolkien only needed six books, in three volumes (not counting The Hobbit as a prelude) to create the modern genre; Lewis only needed seven brief ones to create and end the world of Narnia; and Alexander only needed five in the Prydain Chronicles. There is one key word in writing, Mr. Jordan: economy, or maybe your publisher knows that all too well."
2,A huge disapointment!,"This entire book could have been condensed into a 100 page update to his readers.This would have saved a lot of wasted time and frustration at realizing that nothing important was going to happen!Please Mr.Jordan,I,d rather be kept waiting for another year than be duped and robbed!"
1,Very poor work from a great author.,"It seems that Jordan has Stephen Kind""idus"", meaning he's in a contract and has run out of steam. His last two books have been very poorly done, especially the Path Of Daggers, which can be completely skipped and you won't even realize it."
3,Hoping but not quite there yet.,"This book was not quite as good as the others and I was disappointed but still it wasn't that bad. I missed being able to hear about Mat and what is going on there. Hopefully, the ninth book will bring everything together so it is not just an assortment of personal stories."
4,Come on people... be fair!!!,"To those people who keep on comparing Jordan and Goodkind... pleeeaaassseee stop. Think about it, both authors are REALLY GOOD, no, better than really good... you guys just have to admit that. i personally like both authors and am waiting for their next novels... both WoT and SoT have really good plots... and though they have their simmilarities, the 2 stories are completely different in style and etc... so please... stop fighting over them!!!"
4,I liked this book but I lacked.,This was a really good book but not the best in the wheel of time series. I want to know when the next one is coming out.
1,The nail that broke the coffin's back.,Boring boring stuff. I the other reviews really capture what i found to be the problem with this book: 1) nothing is resolved 2) extreme and tedious detail 3) not all that interesting.I've been keeping up with this story for over 10 years and now I don't think i'll be picking up any of the future releases.I thought the Aie Sedai were supposed to be extremely intelligent and sofisticated. Then they probably shouldn't be arguing on who's going to be cleaning the dishes for the duration of a trip. Reading pages and pages worth of this type of bore is proving just too painful.
2,Boring dissapointment. Good book to help you get to sleep.,"I've read them all, and this latest of the series is the worst by far. Ninety percent of the book seemed like an Act I, Scene 1. The rest was merely the rest of the first Act. I was waiting for something to happen. When it did happen, I had to reread it to figure out what was going on. It may be because I kept falling asleep.This latest installment lacked all the imagination and creativity of the earlier books. It was 600 pages of nothing. Its too bad I can't get my money back. However, I definitely won't buy his next book in hardback. I'll wait for it in the library."
2,Not entirely disapointed.,"I've been a devout RJ fan since the initial publication of WoT. The first book sucked me into the world of RJ and wouldn't let go. Slowly, as the WoT storyline progresses, the hold has been weakening. I am extremely dissapointed with RJ's new book. It reads like an extended prolouge. What's with all the stalling? Was it really necessary to have battle after battle after battle (no matter the significance) with the Seanchan? RJ is an amazing fantasy writer, but...this last book has provided me reason to question that statement."
1,'Beverly Hills 90210' meets 'Little House on the Prairie'!,"A shame. As epic fantasy goes, RJ creates a great world in the first few books. In books 7 & 8 he does, well ... nothing. Nothing at all has happened in the last two books. Compare the earlier books with 'Lan' and 'fierce Aiel' to the current books with ... knitting circles ? Does it read like the same author ? No. If you are unsure, don't buy, read the first 6 books and maybe the 9th."
1,nought,What is there to say? i waited 2 years for a book that has no story. As far as i can see it nothing happened at all in this book. what a waste of paper and money.
3,I am beginning to think old Rob has hoodwinked us.,"I have bought most of the books in the series while they were still in hardback editions. I am beginning to feel like a sucker. The seried started with quite a bit of promise. I really enjoyed reading and rereading the first 3 or 4 books. However, I am beginning to think Mr. jordan is just dragging this out to squeeze more of my hard earned cash out of my pockets."
3,The story seems to be moving too slowly.,"I enjoyed the book, but not as much as the previous books in the series. I feel that there will never be any closure of the plot. I really enjoy reading Mr. Jordan's series and look forward to the next one. This latest one seems to just review many of the situations that peviously had been outlined and covered. I look forward to the story line moving along, and finally bringing this long, enjoyable venture to a conclusion."
2,Nothing Happened,"I waited for so long for this book to come out and when it did, I was ecstatic. But after reading it, I can't believe I was so excited. The only significant things that happened were only mentioned in passing (i.e. Elayne's retaking of her throne). I hope the next one is better."
4,Let's let the guy finish,"I don't think anyone can honestly say that this book is bad until the next one, or even the rest of the series has been written. Any single one of Tolkien's installments to Lord of the Rings is not itself a masterpiece of literature, just as a single movement of a symphony is not a great work in and of itself. It is the whole that counts. We complain now that Jordan's series has for the last two books entered a ""slump"", but doesn't any work require breaks in any kind of continuous action? Let's not forget that a work of this magnitude will hopefully entertain readers for years to come when we complain that this book's dull or its ""taking too long""."
3,What Happened to Mat???,"This wasn't a BAD book, it was just a little slow. The thing that annoyed me was that Mat wasn't in it at all. I like Mat, well, today at least. (My favourite character in the series has changed quite a bit. I've liked them all.) I want to know what happened after the building fell down on him. Did the Seanchan take him away to wherever they're from? Did he get up and find Olver? Is he heading the armies of the Seanchan? I want to know!!!! If there had been just a little part about Mat I would have been happy. There wasn't so I'm not. I can't give the book a very good rating just for that."
3,The Path of Laggers - Jordan's latest book lags behind,"I give credit to Jordan for making a something out of nothing. The content of The Path of Daggers should have been,could have been, written in 100 pages, let alone 600. Throw in his short novel in Legend's, and this book should have approached the length of a Horse Clan's, Gor, or Tarzan novel(I hope the WoT stops before volume #20). However, Jordan somehow draws you into the book and the 600 pages seem like 100. The WoT is a great story, wrtten by a great writer, but it has dragged out over too many years and too many volumes that advance the plot very little. If any readers are thinking of taking up the Wheel of Time series, I suggest waiting until it is finished(sometime after the year 2000), the waiting game is the worst part of reading any series, and this one is rediculous."
2,What to do?,"I have been waiting for years for this sequel, and read it in one go, only to end up with two questions: What is going on, or rather why are we standing still? and When's the next one due? This book could have been reconsidered, re-written, and condensed to about 300 pages. TOO SLOW!"
2,I kept waiting for something to happen...,"Jordan's bookshelf-spanning epic just keeps getting better! uh hmm. Is it ever going to end?!? Nothing major (or small) was accomplished throughout the 6 million pages of this door-jam. I gave it two stars simply because i was able to read it, the book is not badly written, and because i've been reading the series since the Eye was first published --I can't stop now! did you notice the irony of the last real chapter? ""Beginnings"" that's NOT a good sign!"
1,Would give this book zero stars if Amazon.com let me....,"This book was a HUGE disappointment. It took me forever to read - at times I found myself nodding off or thinking about other things while trying to read it. I appreciate attention to detail as much as the next guy (or gal), but after reading this rather questionable piece of literature, I am forced to agree with the general consensus that Mr. Jordan is stalling for time. I can only hope the next book will be better..."
2,Get on with it......,"I will be short in my anger. The basic story line has been drawn out now for two books, and this, the evil third, has simply stagnated. Mr. Jordan, get ON with it. The plot is a classic, but it needs to be concluded before I begin praying for the seals to be broken and Rand getting his hat handed to him..........."
3,You can't tell a good WOT story in 600 pages,"Everyone loved the first seven books of this series. And yet, everyone thinks this is the worst yet. Lord of Chaos was my favorite, and it was the longest. A path of Daggers is half the size. What's up with that? When i go to buy a Robert Jordan book, especially one I just paid 20 odd dollars and waited two years for, I expect more. Where is the sense of accomplishment. No Forsaken even died, a staple of the last few books. Robert Jordan is almost backpedaling with all of these new Forsaken and a new Na'blis (excuse the spelling). Either that or he is really moving for an epic final book, with rand destroying numerous wielders of the power, cleansing saidin, and Destroying the Dark one. Maybe the next book will be Matt and Rand heavy, because one blows the horn of Valere and the other finally fights Tarmon Gaidin. Maybe Masema will be united with Rand and his rabble used as Trolloc fodder.God I hope so."
1,a study in ethereality,"I think either I have somehow lost the ability to comprehend what I am reading or this book is 600 pages of fluff. I think it is time to put an end to the exploitation of epic fantasy readers. Mr. Jordan needs to understand that the genius of Tolkien, Donaldson and Williams is their quality and continuity of content not their quantity. I have been extremely impressed by this series up to this point, but really, this book could have been one or maybe two chapters in a legitimate story progression. Save your self the time and skip this one, you won't miss anything."
1,"Woefully anti-climactic, truly disappointing","After having spent several months re-reading all seven of the previous W.O.T. books and haunting my local bookstore in anticipation of the arrival of Path of Daggers, I am disappointed beyond my meager ability to express. Prior to reading POD, I also (like many of the authors of the reviews I just looked over) truly loved Jordan's previous works, and felt that the W.O.T. series might be the best fantasy series ever published. However, the Path of Daggers convinced me that my earlier beliefs were erroneous. The series has stagnated in the last two books, particularly in POD. POD did little or nothing to advance the plot of the series towards its alleged ultimate conclusion - Rand's battle against the Dark One. Given the lack of intelligence or common sense attributed to Rand and the other ""good guys"" in this installment of the series, it would seem that the world is doomed."
1,Path of Daggers: An unfinished Snore Fest,"I managed to read all of Jordan's books in one day each (they were mesmerizing), with the notable exception of ""Path of Daggers"". I hope to god that the next book is not the disapointment this one was. Not only did this book not go anywhere, but much of the discription in the jacket, just did not happen (when might Perrin have to forfit his soul to save Failie), it might as well have been discribing the next book.Finish what you start Jordan."
1,Wait for the paperback,"If you have read the 7 previous books, no amount of words will convince you not to get Jordan's latest tome. My advise is to wait for the paperback and then be disapointed. This series is turning dismal, trite, and just plain boring. I don't see any conclusion on the horizon; for all we know, Jordan plans to milk the WOT for the next 10 years (5 books @ 2years apiece). Like other addictions, you will be better served to wean yourself from the WOT now, not later."
2,nothing happens!?!!!?,"I waited a long time for this, and nothing happens! Since I've really enjoyed the series (overall rate it 4 1/2)I'll read the next one, but, I too will look elsewhere if subjected to 800 pages of fluff."
2,Worst of the batch,"Taken as a whole the series is great, but this book truly degrades the integrity of Jordan's work. With a series already 8 books long and apparently a few more on the way, the law averages would dictate that some of these books will stink in comparison to the best books in the series. Jordan however has rolled out 2 consecutive bombs, that have somehow lost the fervor contained within the first 5-6 books. Seeing that the series will last at what I have heard will be in the neighborhood of 10 volumes, Jordan needs to recapture some of the intensity of the first few books. Then I will not look so harshly on these last 2 volumes, but instead think of them as some test of pain or mental stamina."
2,Series in Stasis,"It starts out slow -- 90 pages to walk through a travel gateway... by page 100 it starts to get interesting. Perrin has been sent off to straighten out the Prophet. Egwene is establishing control of the rebels. Mat's off who knows where doing something that Jordan doesn't see fit to tell us about. Elayne is on her way to claim the Lion Throne. Min and Rand DO _it_ alot. The Seanchan are back, but Rand defeats them with a small army and some Asha'man. Some go nuts. Lots of interesting things are going on but __nothing__ gets resolved! After reading the above you now have the same experience I had reading the entire book. It seems like the series has been in a holding pattern for 3 volumes now. Robert, if you're really getting bored with it, hang it up for a while. You're not doing justice to the Wheel of Time the way things are moving now."
2,expected more from robert jordan--one of my favorite authors,"Could not wait till the soft copy came out, I was so excited with the last 7 books...to make a long story short, I was very disappointed with this book--literally had to force myself to finish it. The sad part is, is that I will probably buy the next book just to finish the series...hopefully this is not how Robert Jordan is going to continue with his career. Found absolutely nothing new, and the characters had something missing, as well as the story line. As a reader, it seemed to me, that even Robert Jordan seemed bored with the whole concept in the book---as a fan--let's hope this is not the case."
3,Consolidation,"Nothing much new happens and no new chracters or ideas are introduced. The book consolidates book 7 and sets us up for a fantastic 9. I love this series more as time goes on, mid way thorugh I had almost given up but now I am in love again. The character of Rand is being briliantly developed as he tips nearer madness. CAn't wait for 9."
2,Jordan is really dragging out the story now.,"This book has good parts and bad parts--mostly bad. My favorite characture, Mat, does not even have a role. Perrin used to be a good character, but the last couple of books have seen him become a hen-pecked shell of a man. Even when he tries to stand up for himself, he is not doing it for himself but only to please the hyper-domineering Faile. Very few loose-ends are tied up, but even more strands are tangled into the mess. At least Jordan handles magic well, but even some of the Asha'man have started going soft.This is not a series I would recommend."
1,Not worth the wait!,"The story slows down even more than in The Crown of Swords. Mindless details that essentially repeat information from previous books. Story becomes even more convoluted with no progress on the actual story line. If you are into the series, wait for the paperback. Otherwise wait until the series is over and then decide."
1,Jordan's lost in the distractions,"I could forgive the lack of Mat if POD had eliminated the painful distractions. Jordan should lose: Faile (hopelessly annoying), Berelain (ditto), the Shaido, the Game of Houses, how lords and ladies dress ,TearI could go on, but you get the idea. Who gives a rap about the livery of Cairienhin servants? Get to the meat: Elaida (okay, underway), saidin (so cleanse it already), the Foresaken (do they actually do bad stuff -- or just dispense aspirin for the Amyrlin(s)?)"
2,Could have been better,I will wait for the ninth book to decide whether Robert Jordan's standard has really dropped.
3,Having trouble converting from audio to visual,"The first seven books in the series I 'read' by listening to the unabridged version of the audiotape. I found them all very entertaining, enjoyable, and imaginative. An unabridged audio version of this book is not available at the time I'm writing this, and I am having trouble buckling down to read the very thick Path of Daggers. Also, I find if I let too much time go between books, it's somewhat hard to recapture the excitement and adventure that Jordan has been weaving."
2,Robert Jordan lost his story,"What a pity. When it all begun, it had been a good story. Nice charcters, great ideas. The women's character's have always been a bit weak (tugging at braids and skirts and sniffing all the time), but who cares? The Forsaken, Ta'veren, Aes Sedai... thrilling indeed.Now he's lost it. Jordan seems to have lost the read thread alltogether. I have the impression that he himself does not know anymore where this shall all lead to. A pity indeed.My suggestion: Read George R. R. Martin instead."
1,"Wordy, Lame! A pointless expensive effort for the reader.","If you need word volume to fill in your time, I can highly recomend this book. To make it short, the characters are fine, the world is fine and nothing has changed except the title and volume number...and that includes the price. Either way, save the dollars and buy a meal. You'll get more value and a much greater post consumption quotient. Sorry ,Bob, but this dont' cut it. And, naw. I can't write a book...but we, your fans, know that you can and are, therefore, sorely disappointed with this one."
2,Just one huge prologue,"I'm hooked dammit, though this book really makes me want to just give up on the series. I just re-read all 8 books in the last 2 weeks and I have to say this volume is the worst by far. All rising action and no climax. I feel like I ripped off when I bought this THING.Hey Jordon, let's get on with it already. And where's MAT!My advice, wait till the series is done before starting it. You won't be so frustrated."
1,Where did the story go?,"I have to say, after reading the first few books of the series, I loved it. After reading this book, it is becoming obvious that it was published strictly to sell books. It contains absolutely nothing to further the story along, and honestly it takes a very skilled writer to fill that many pages with absolute white noise. I will certainly look at the reviews from other readers before I blindly buy another Robert Jordan book."
3,How many more are there going to be?,"This book was very well written but lacked a progressive plot throughout the story. The series could have done without this book, I mean it's just a whole lot of battles and romances rolled into a book. You could read the first and the last 100 pages and still be able to figure out the entire story.How many more are there going to be?!?!?! I mean, we all read 1-3 and thought, oh man, only a few more books left in this series. But no, he wrote another four, and two yet to come. In the beggining of this series it was one of the best sets of novels ever written, then it got boring, I mean no plt progression, come on! This has all become one big money making scheme. Jordan is trying to figure out how long he can keep turning out a novel every 3 years and still keep us hooked. And what is the deal with the"
3,The plot is just way to slow.,"When I started reading Jordan I loved his series. No other series has the depth or complexity that Jordan has created. But the POD just doesn't go anywhere. It is so convuluted that one wonders if Jordan knows what the eventual ending will be. Is he ever going to get there? If you are into the series keep reading and pray things pick back up. If you haven't started the series, do not start it now. You will be hooked early on and sorry when you read the last installments that have stalled out."
2,Amazing writter goes capitalist,"The Wheel of Time Series began as one of the greatest epic stories,but things have changed. Robert Jordan provided quality fantasy in his first two books. After that the story went into slow motion. The once fast paced adventure turned into a long boring story. From the third book on, Jordan has dragged the story at an incredibly slow pace. I only read the 8th book because I wanted to see what would happen to the Dragon Reborn. My advice is to not start the series, because you will become a slave to it."
1,Jordan's worst book ever. Skip it.,"If you are addicted to this series, this book might cure you. It was so poorly written that I worry about Robert Jordan. Maybe his health is failing. If you insist on buying this mess, I recommend you start reading on p. 421 if you find the Aes Sedai pompous, or start reading on p. 293 if you love them. Yes, this book rises to mediocrity after 300 or 400 pages of absolute slop."
2,slow & tedious,After a long wait since finishing the first 6 I paid for Path of Daggers with a gleam in my eyes. Days later I was deflated & felt so let down - just about everything in this book was second rate - did he have some kind of deadline to reach & so gave them this?? I just hope that 8 & 9 are like the first 6. To make me feel better after reading this I wiped the dust from my Steven Donaldson Chronicles of Thomas Covenant (1st & 2nd) & read an excellent Fantasy series
2,I'm getting quite sad about it,"Reading all these reviews of PoD has become quite as long and boring as most of them say the book is! In fact, I really hope Robert Jordan reads these (and all the othere) reviews, so as to get an idea about what the Wheel has become lately. That's making me sad, man: this one should have been the best Fantasy series ever, but now it seems its very author is spoiling it all for... what? Self-inflation? money-lust (personally, I don't think)? Inertia? I dunno my friends..."
1,"Stay away...far, far away!!!","I don't like to beat a dead horse here, but I believe Mr. Jordan has beaten me to the punch! He lost me completely in book one of the series (Eye of the World). On the suggestion of a friend, I gave the book a sincere try. But after 400 pages of sheer torture, I just had to put it down. Am I ever glad I did! Not only is his concept trite, Mr. Jordan simply has little talent for writing or arousing the interest of earnest Fantasy readers...unless cheap comic books are your thing.I come from the world of J.R.R. Tolkien, Stephen R. Donaldson, Frank Herbert...to name a few. These are authors who created actual worlds in which you could live and breathe, and who wove a rich tapestry of believable characters and events. Mr. Jordan's work can't hold a candle to these masterpieces. This is bubble-gum kiddie-kitsch at its best. Save your hard-earned money and valuable time, folks and...STAY AWAY!!"
3,"Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...how about some closure already?","I love the plot lines. I love the characters. I love the cross-generational, cross-era histories and interweavings. I love the feeling of seeing both sides of the misunderstandings between the men and women, and think Jordan does a great job of developing personalities and conflicts. In short, I am an avid fantasy reader who believes this is one the best series ever.And yet. And yet. After eight voluminous tomes, I see no closure in sight, unless Mr. Jordan changes his current style and brings everything to a sudden close. I thoroughly enjoy these novels and anxiosuly await each new one, but I have to admit I grow impatient for some resolution.Of course, once the series IS done I will wish for more. Call me fickle."
2,"Come on - lets get going, too much detail about nothing","I was hoping the series would progress a little more than it did. I would like to read a story, not read hundreds of pages of babble. [disappointed to say the least]Would feel better if the next book was due out next month."
5,Robert Jordan at his best!?!?,"This is the book that everyone has waited for. For two years Jordans fans have been wondering what is going on? I believe this is one of the definitive series in the science fiction realm. I wish that he had not gone back and forth so much, but that is to be evpected when you are a narrative god. I just wish to tell everyone that this book is definitely worth the wait though. And the ending is just, well, um, I will leave that for you to decide"
3,"Certainly not bad, but RJ seems to excel at circumlocution.","I do believe it was better than A Crown of Swords. Thankfully, a few things happened, however not as many as I think the readers deserved. Perhaps telling the story from Mat's, or Nynaeve's, perspective might have helped; I know several people who were very disappointed by the lack of attention paid to their favorite characters. Jordan's emphasis on the continual misunderstandings between men and women is getting predictable at this point. While it is amusing, it wouldn't hurt to deviate from stereotypes once in a while and perhaps make the characters a bit more complex.However, PoD is still an enjoyable read. So-called ""filler"" books can still be interesting. Jordan could be setting us up for an incredible ninth book, though not necessarily. After all, sieges can be terribly boring, and Dyelin may want to stall for a bit to gain support for herself. But if it's done even half-well, the next book should be spectacular."
3,"It was a major ""builder"" Book.","One of Jordan's habits when he writes is to biuld up his books to a major event. I have found that the more Jordan ""builds"" his events, the more profound the outcome. By itself, this book is a push-over, nothing really happens. But becuse I am a Wheel of Time fanatic I know something big is going to happen. If Jordan used a whole book as a builder, be prepared to be blown out of the water with the next book"
2,I give Jordan 2 more books.,"I must say, I, like many other Wheel of Time fans, was a bit dissapointed with The Path of Daggers. It seemed, like many have said, to be a setup for book nine, with nothing really happening and no conclusion that I could see. I understand that Jordan may have been pushed a bit for this book, what with it going over 2 1/2 years, but I really expected more.I'm giving Robert Jordan untill book 10 (which I'll probibly wait untill it's in paperback) to get me hooked again. If not, I'm going over to George RR Martin's Earth, Wind, & Fire series for my faviorite Fantasy series ever.I'm not like many others here, saying that Robert Jordan is a horribal writer or just milking it. I think that's just stupid. What I do think is that Jordan is taking a bit too long in this series and should really speed it up a bit. Because if he doesn't, his next book isn't even going to come close to the sales of the latest few."
1,"Like a lot of fans, I was extremely disappointed","I hate to add my voice to the cacophony of criticism that has preceded it, but I must say that I was extremely disappointed in RJ's newest. The two-year wait was extremely anticlimactic. RJ seemed to be struggling for a plot--and for the first time, I wondered whether he actually knows where the WoT series is going. This is the eighth book in the series; we don't need more character development, and certainly not without any plotline. This book was so lacking that I found myself questioning whether it was worthwhile to read book nine when it comes out."
2,Dont buy this book!!!,"Jordan once again give us a sub-par effort. However, the quality won't improve as long as people keep snapping up the trash he is currently putting out. If you are like me and miss the good old days when this series actually had books with conclusions, do us a favor and check it out from the library."
2,Plot lines left dangling in the Machin Shin,"Is it just me, or did anyone else think that the cover blurb wasn't written by someone who'd actually read the book? E.g. what was that about with Perrin's soul and Faile in danger? Or could it be that Tor has chopped this book into two in order to double its revenues....I hope that this is the case and the state of this book isn't entirely down to Jordan."
4,Jordan is making his way into the history books,"Yes, it took a long time. No I didn't like waiting 2 years. On the other hand, I would much rather wait, and let Jordan take the time he needs to write a solid story, than have him rush through and turn out more pulp. Sure this story moved a little slow in places. So? Jordan is taking his time to give us a world with a level of detail not found in anything save Tolkien's Middle Earth. You can't do that by rushing through it. I, for one, loved this book as I have loved every other WoT book. Hurrah for Jordan, and take as long as you need. If you need to stretch it to 12 or 15 or more books, I will buy every one on the day it is released."
1,Will there ever be an end to this series!,"I am a truly devoted Robert Jordan and Wheel of Time fan however, about the only good thing to say regarding Path of Daggers is that I finished it. It was pure torture. I know Mr. Jordan realizes that the year 2000 represents Armageddon, I can only hope he finishes this series before the end of the world comes. Hey Robert, stop dangling a carrot at the end of a string... GET TO THE POINT, FINISH THIS SERIES; YOU'RE KILLING ME!"
1,Save your time and money!,"This in my opinion is the worst book in the WOT series. You could completely skip this book and read the next, and would not have missed anything! Nothing happens in this book. Well OK without giving it away, to be fair, two things of any importance happens, but they could have been told in less than 100 pages. There was no significant character development, just battles that were so long winded, that after a while I didn't care who won. Even these had little significance to the WOT story. It seemed like Jordan just pumped out another book to please his fans and he really missed the boat this time. I look foward to his next book, but hope that I will learn a little bit more about the WOT world in the next 500 plus pages."
2,Like a child tumbling over his own toungue...,"Jordan's previous efforts were some of the best books I've ever read, but Daggers, however, lacked consistency and momentum. A paragraph on this character, a chapter on that, a page describing characters that have no impact through the entire book, then back to other characters I had almost forgotten about. He should pick no more than three central characters and tell their stories, not narrate the lives of 8 distinct groups of people."
2,This took two years !!!!!!,"As a dedicated fan for the last ten years, there has been a serious degradation of quality in the story line. The story hasn't moved in the last two books and frankly this installment was a chore to read. I also expected a longer book, but this one is eighty pages shorter than the last. Is it a sellout to the fans, maybe , money is important but you have to consider the needs of the fans and what they have come to expect in a product from the past. With authors like Terry Goodkind knocking on your door, you soon find that the throneroom is empty."
1,waste of time,"I have been with the wot since the eye of the world first came out, i have just finished pod for the second time. Parts of this book do not even read like jordon. Almost like a ghost writer or he rushed it-- just to shut us up. The plot line with the women is really starting to get old--Rand is no longer a person you even care about very little on perrin and nothing on mat. unless you are a big fan of wot do not waste your time.of course i still want book nine. Pod is kind of like kissing your best female friend it's nice but does not do anything for you"
1,Very Disappointing,"In one word - awful. The women seem to spend most of their time standing arms akimbo, glaring at each other, when they aren't either simpering, or sniffing, or tugging on braids (how come Nynaeve has any hair left?), or rearranging shawls to the tinkling of bracelets. Hundreds of new characters, very minor, mere names ... Meralda, Selande, Famelle, Chilares, Kirstian, Dimana, Sumeko ... any one know who these people are? Nothing happens for hundreds of pages. When it does, torpor returns.The English say that one can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse, but RJ has managed to turn a silk purse into a sow's ear."
4,"cool, but could be better",Robert Jordan (if you ever will read this)- I love your Wheel of Time books! However I've felt that the last two books were rather slow-paced and could be better. I still like them though!
3,"The Path was too long, Substance to short","While I have gotten hooked on Jordan's work, I was very displeased with the lack of substance and action in The Path of Daggers. This book was full of fillers and non-sensical dialog with absolutely no substance and many inconsistancies from prevous books. Example, the battle between the Senchan and Rands forces was trivialized to the last few pages, but one day of travel of Elaine on horse back had conversations that lead nowhere for 20+ pages. I found myself skipping more than I was reading. One of the key characters in the last 7 books, Mat, wasn't even brought back in this book.It seemed that Jordan needed to drag out the epic, with very little progress toward the final battle with the dark one. If the next book is like this one, it will be the last for me."
1,nothing but power struggle,"in this book the beauty, wonder, and friendship had been bred out. Nothing is left but power struggle: who could out-stare who, who outrank who, who is brought to heel. these are the basis of all relations in WoT. If you are not manipulating someone you are oppossing someone, or bootlicking, or snarling, glaring. Politics permeates everything. It is as grim as a real-life newsreel. I found myself caring less and less for Rand and the other heroes. Frankly, I don't know what to look forward to anymore."
3,Wheel just drags on,I love the wheel of time and the first 5 books were awesome. Now I feel like I'm being dragged along. The life of the characters seems unfocused. I'm not sure if I can keep reading the series. Most of the plot could have been resolved a while back and then Jordan could have gone off on these side trips. Even with all the problems in the last few installments I still adore this series and this author. He will be missed.
4,Give the book it's credit,"I've read a couple less than kind reviews of this book.. and I have to pipe in and say that it was nowhere near as bad as people have said. By the time I finished book 7, I was pretty tired of the same formula too. Path of Daggers, however, has one surprising development after another. I finished half the book on one Saturday sitting, and then read through the rest during the week before bed. It's a quick read, and lots of plots are wrapped up/reopened (ever wonder what happened to Lan?) The ending.. is very disappointing, and very obviously a setup for the next book. But that's fine with me, so long as there's plenty of Perrin and Faile in it!"
2,Extremely disappointing - where's the other half of the book,"Path of Daggers was better than Crown of Swords but is woefully inferior to the first six volumes. Basically, the reader is left wondering where the other half of the story is. The story is relatively simple and does not answer the hanging questions from the earlier volumes. Robert Jordan, if you are reading this, please-oh-please publish the next book soon (less than a year +) and address the questions we all want answered.A loyal Wheel of Time fan..."
2,Jordan marks time in a slow-paced yawner.,"After waiting two years for the sequel to the wonderful ""A Crown of Swords"", this book was a huge disappointment. Jordan spends most of his time dealing with peripheral issues and introducing an endless amount of minor characters. We do not see Rand until midway through and Mat is not even in this book. Very few of the central issues get resolved; the White Tower remains divided, the Black Tower is unchanged, the Chosen continue to plot but do nothing, there is no movement in Rand's relationship with his women and we are no closer to the final battle than before. What we get is a brooding and boring Rand and little of anything else. Its time to end this series or move things along. Robert Jordan. Are you are you listening???"
5,"please, please, please, move this series along!","Couldn't agree more with the review below. Through ""the Shadow Rising"", this series was the best fantasy series in a long time. Since Rand led the Aeil out of Rhuidean though the series has completely lost its focus. It just seems like Jordan has bit off far more that he can chew and, rather than finishing up what he has already started, he keeps introducing more and more characters into the soup. I think this series has completely degenerated into a soap opera. My only hope is that, as Jordan says, he has had the last book planned from the beginning, which means that the end will be memorable, even if we have to wade through thousands more pages of pap to get to it.disappointing."
2,Bitterly Disappointing,"WOT is possibly the best fantasy series ever. But I imagine a number of those waiting for this one will be disappointed. As others have mentioned, this book reads like a 600 page prologue. First we wait nearly half the book for a glimpse of Rand, then read the rest futilely for a look at perhaps the series' most engaging character, Mat. I suppose one cannot expect Jordan to produce a Shadow Rising or Fires of Heaven every time, but frankly most of this reads as filler. There are a few bright spots, but this is otherwise an unremarkable step towards what will hopefully be an exciting book nine. The Light send we get something better after what will surely be another interminable wait for it."
5,"Read it, Best one yet!!!","I've read all the Jordan books, WOT and most if not all the Conan books, this is his best work yet. He ties all the rest of the WOT books together with this one. I'm now reading it for the second time."
4,"Not the best of his Works, but far from his worst.","I've read all of The Wheel of Time books and I think that I can say that this is not his best writing. The deep interest about the actions of Egwene and all other Aes Sedai are all well and good but I think that Mat is a much more interesting suject. Whatever the case may be, I find that the storyline has become very complex (which is not a bad thing) but sometimes I gotta read the chapter again to get what it's about. The book also opens up new questions like ""Who are these new Forsaken?"". All in all, the book left me with an anticipation to read the next one. Another TWO YEARS!! I moan at the thought."
3,PLEASE GET ON WITH IT!,"Ok i thought this story was pretty good except nothing really major happened and what about Mat! in the last book ya end with Mat saying ""Where's my bloody luck now?"" CRASH! ROCKS AND JUNK FALL ON HIM! COME ON NOT ONE TIME WAS HE EVEN MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK! I hope that the next book to come out is going to be the last or at least a lot better than this one."
2,Not able to stand on its own,"One of the maxims of a great novel, even a novel in a series, is an ability to stand on its own feet without the support of previous or later works. The first 5 books did this easily, The Path of Daggers does not. It is clear that Jordan has much to say, but his prose is getting sloppy, derivitive of himself, and is not engaging. I am not a writer, but have sympathy for the creative process, so if Mr. Jordan wants to end the series short of a climax, he should issue a press statement and let people know. Otherwise, return to tighter, more dynamic style written for the earlier books.This for his publisher, I WILL NOT BUY ANYMORE NEW BOOKS WRITTEN BY MR. JORDAN UNTIL HE ONCE AGAIN PROVES HIS ABILITY TO WRITE. I wanted to return Path of Daggers, but I'm willing to give him a chance. NO MORE HARDCOVERS, I'M NOT KIDDING!!"
2,BORING!!!,"I have read all 8 of his books and I think they're awesome, but this book has to be the most boring I've ever read! RJ needs to hurry some things up a bit - it's the exact same as the COS except a few new things happening in different places. Nothing gets solved except that they use the Bowl of Winds or whatever that was. Where was Mat?!? Don't leave me hanging, RJ - get the next book out soon!"
3,Get on with it- I waited two years for this,"I have been with this story from the beginning, and have enjoyed it. However, there seems to be a lack of direction in the last 2 novels. I like the progressin of the characters, the intrigue, the slowly evoling storyline, everything, but this has stoppped progressing and now just drags. There are parts of this book that are entertaining, but this book could have been condensed into a few chapters, rather than a 600 page book. Please, Mr. Jordan, continue evolving the story, so that I can finish it before my time here is done ( i only have 20-30 years left)"
3,This book isn't finished!!,"The entire book is a buildup to something. It seems to me that Mr. Jordan wanted to go somewhere with all of this and ended up writing too much. This book is an intro into the next book. By itself it is really annoying. I mean, I need SOME closure. This book just opens up all new bags of goodies that I have to obsess over (and most are just mysterious sub-plots). The only thing that saves this book is that Robert Jordan is such a good writer, and the characters are done so well (except for the very noticable absence of Mat) that it is enjoyable to read (as long as you've read the previouse books of course. In the end this book is fun, but it is not a story in and of itself. It's a bridge to the next book. You have to read it if you are into the series though, if only for plot progression."
4,worthwhile,"An excellent book which keeps the narrative going, although judging by the other comments, this is a matter of much debate. The lack of excitement and battle scenes is unimportant. The character development is terrific, and the world just keeps getting richer with each installment. I for one, would get bored if the series consisted of unending action and battle scenes. Jordan is a veritable master at keeping his ten thousand plot lines moving.As for Rand doing stupid things, well, that's part of the appeal. He's not a ludicrous character who matures from callow farm boy to general/statesman/politican extraordinaire in the course of a few novels. He is human, he makes mistakes, and screws up. The characters' failures humanize the story, and make it far more readable. Highly recommended, I look forward to the next book."
1,The slowwwly-turning Wheel of Time has broken spokes....,"The slowwwly-turning Wheel of Time has more than a few broken spokes. The series has devolved into pro forma hack prose marked by totally stagnant plotting. Even the normally-annoying misogynistic female characters have turned BLAND and only irritate out of habit, as it were. If there is a pattern here, then the next one should probably be entitled Road to Limbo . . . ."
1,Unreadable,"It is astounding how this author has taken an interesting, fascinating and imaginative story and turned it into a boring piece of drivel. If this series was a horse, it would have been shot long ago."
1,Do not buy this book. You have been warned.,"My advice to anyone that has not already bought this book is to borrow it or check it out at the library. The best advice would be to get a summary of what happened, (which is not much) and wait and see what the next book brings. I will finish the series, but not by way of buying the books with my money. If more readers would do the same, maybe authors would think twice about releasing garbage to make money."
1,Utter Bull Sh*t!!!!,I can't articulate how awful this sh*t is! Read the 1000 other scathing posts to get some idea.When the series began to deteriate after the 4th or 5th book I used to think that I may have just gotten older and more mature. But these posts have showed me that it isn't me but Jordan who is changing. What the hell is happening?I wouldn't read the next book if you paid me $50.You're a sell-out Jordan!!!
1,Wheel of Greed,"Book 1: WOW!! I can't wait to find out what happens next. Book 2: WOW!! This is fantastic, I haven't enjoyed a series this much since LOTR. Book 3: AMAZING! This one is the best so far. Book 4 : Good! I wish the plot would move faster though. Book 5 : Hmmm. Well, I guess everyone can have an off day. I sure hope the pace picks up soon and an end is in sight. Book6 : Uhhh. Jordon doesn't seem to want to let go. Book 7 : ARGGG!! Stop the infernal repetitive descriptions already. Book 8 : $%#?%!! Does Better Business know about this, it's a scam.My conclusion : This story will never end. Jordon has no idea where to go. Had this been a 4 book series, it would have gone down as a masterpiece. Instead it will go down as a MAKE MONEY SLOW scheme.I give up!!! I no longer care what happens. My advice is to save your hard earned cash."
4,Horrible !! In Austria we have to wait until December !!,"I started to absorb those 6100 pages 2 years ago until I reached the end of Part 6 just-in-time of the ""A Crown of Swords"" release. I loved it, but couldn't believe it not over yet. Considering RJ's seemingly never-ending breath and therefore expecting a new 1000-pages-tribute to Rand and his friends, I enjoyed myself in the meantime with other Fantasy by M.Rawn, T.Goodkind, G.R.R.Martin and so on.But now I WANT THAT SEQUEL !!! I restarted the whole episode, because I can't remember a thing (not even the Seanchan!)and being right now with ""The Dragon Reborn"" and I hope to make it 'til December, where you probably have read it already and start moaning about waiting again (or does it end with #8 ??)!!Well, enjoy it anyway, I'm not too far behind !!"
1,If you love watching hours of C-Span...,"then you'll love this book! And I thought watching politicians prattle on and on about some obscure issue that only people in their home district care about in an empty House Chamber late at night was boring, well let me tell you that POD makes C-Span seem like exciting television. Jordan needs to take writing lessons from George R.R. Martin, who is making a run at winning the title of best modern fantasy writer. (Okay, maybe Gene Wolfe or Orson Scott Card should get it.) There is a reason why, to the best of my knowledge, no book from the WOT series has ever won, or even been nominated, for a Nebula or Hugo Award. Sorry Jordan, I'm off this endless ride. Enjoy my money...."
1,This book is big....,"But that's the only positive thing I can say about it. I highly recommend that Jordan stop writing books in this series (it is getting really old) and readers stop reading these books. I haven't been able to finish any of this series since the first two books, although I stupidly keep trying."
2,really a let down,"I was really dissapointed with this book. I love the others, but at the Lord of Chaos, it started slipping. A crown of swords was better cuz it actually had an ending, but this! this book sucks!i mean, Mat wasn't in it at all, and he had like the BEST roll! the last thing they said about him was in the end of a crown of swords when the seanchan attacked ebou dar. then they just STOP! i couldnt believe it! and then, the biggest dissapointment was Rand. i mean, he didnt do anything the whole book until the end when he attacked the seanchan. but he killed his own army witht eh lightning and the seanchan regroup adn ride away. i mean, all i can say is WHAT THE HECK???? id read it just so that you can finish the series though, but be warned."
1,"Worst ""epic"" ever","Thank goodness I stopped at Book 4. I now wonder why I wasted the money and time...oh well, that can't be helped now. Please tell me something, why is he popular? He is not only wasting pages, he's wasting words. If you want to pick up a real fantasy epic, try Tolkein's the Hobbit, Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar Saga Series, or R.A. Salvatore's Dark elf series.Don't waste your money or time on this claptrapI give this ""1 star"", only because I have to."
2,"The Path of Daggers (The Wheel of Time, Book 8)","This book was terrible. It drug on and on and in the end nothing much really happened. It's nothing more than filler pages used in order to extend the story one more book. Fortunately, book 9 is better, though still not as good as the first six books."
2,SERIES O'PAIN,"Is it just me or do all the women in RandLand spend all of their time smoothing/adjusting their skirts? His series is now approaching 4000 pages and 25% of them focus on the status of skirts. This series has become one ridiculously huge annuity plan for Mr. Jordan. Greenpeace activists should be manning a 24-hour WTO-like protest on his front lawn for all of the trees he has sacrificed by drawing this thing out over 8 books. The number of characters has grown so big that the Manhattan phone directory must have at least 23,498 fewer listings than what a true WOT directory would show. The Dustin Hoffman character from RAINMAN would have a tough time trying to keep track of them all. I am sorely disappointed that the author seems to think he can ream his audience repeatedly and get away with it. Mr. Jordan clearly suffers from diarreah of the word processor. God invented libraries for a reason and that reason has a name: Robert Jordan."
2,Where's Matt?,"This book was pointless nothing happened. Rand found out that callandor inhanses the taint, and Egwen seiged the White Tower. Nothing about Matt! This book was bye far the worst!"
3,Wheel of Time Time-out,"Personally, I mostly enjoyed this The Path of Daggers. If you like the Wheel of Time series, this was more of the same, but s l o w t i m e. If you haven't liked other books in this series, you wouldn't like this book."
1,End My Torment!!!!!!!!,"I bought ""The Eye Of The World"" about five years ago, and caught up with Mr. Jordan's writing about six months later. Each time I buy a new novel, I anticipate some move toward closure and then spend a couple years waiting for the next book with a little less exitement. Robert Jordan has captivated my attention for over five years, but I think that he has ""milked"" this series for all that it's worth. Even an author of his caliber cannot imperceptibly drag out a story for such a long period of time. Mr. Jordan, please complete this work so that I can look forward to reading your future work!!!!"
2,Slow-moving and Difficult to Follow,"The Path of Daggers is a slow-moving extension to the Wheel of Time fantasy. The author continually introduces new characters, usually in multiples, and the result is confusion in the narrative form. The climactic action of the book takes place at the very end, as in most of Jordan's books. All-in-all, a very disappointing read."
2,Glad I borrowed it from the library,"I share the same sentiments as others who were also disappointed by POD. 6 flippin' chapters to get those annoying women to use the damn bowl?!? I was *this close* to quitting after the 3rd or 4th chapter... Where's Mat? Perrin has basically one task this book, and he doesn't even get to finish it? At least the cover art is getting a *bit* better. I'm glad I found Guy Gavriel Kay while waiting forever for this one."
1,I am let down again.,"I have just finished Jordan's latest book, and feel I wasted my time. I found myself drifting off through most of the book because a surprising lack of interest on Jordan's part to actually want to end this series. I became thoroughly enraptured by the series when it first came out, but I cannot continue to read a storyline that just does not seem to get anywhere. The only reason I bought this last book, was because I believed he may try to end the series, or at least bring some of the situations to a head. Neither happened.I have invested so much time over the years to not finish the series, but I may not after this last book. I almost do not give a damn to what may happen to Rand and his cohorts. It has become a struggle to get through one of his volumes."
2,this book could use some action,"First of all, where's Matt? And what exactly are ""the paths of daggers""? no where in the book is the title referred to (as in the others). I waited nearly two years for a book that rambles on aobut a bunch of old hens and Rand acting like a schmuck!! If Mr. Jordan ever reads this I only ask that either you write your books faster as you did in the beginning or you add more action (like the shadow rising). I will gladly read everything you publish if you just did one or the other. As for my review, WAIT!!! Read the others several times over a period of 2 years for his next book and buy this one. Or wait for the paperback, you'll save money and time that way."
3,Disappointed,Disappointing volume. The most interesting character (I think anway) Mat doesn't even appear in this book. Jordan's a good writer but he can be boring at times. I find myself skipping through the tedious parts. Maybe he needs better editors.
1,I'm FEMALE...Jordan's Women: A Review,"I'm female. I think the women in Jordan's books behave like complete aliens. I have NEVER met women like these -- not even the craziest, stupidest women I've had the bad fortune to run across. Jordan writes women like I have a p@n!$.I'm female and wasn't born yesterday. I have never, ever, EVER met a woman that resembles any of the women in Joradan's WoT series. EVER. Anywhere, anytime."
1,"skip book 8, you won't be lost when 9 comes out","I was disapointed with RJ a few years ago,when my son and I waited in line for 2 hours at a book signing in Charleston SC ... guess who was a no show? Yep just like book 8, RJ was a no show. Early on the first few books made me a fan. I once got to book 6 of a series by L Ron Hubbard call Mission Earth, before I couldn't take it anymore. Well I broke my old record, I got to book 8 of WOT, but I can't take it anymore. yep I'm the no show from now on. So RJ write all you want, take all the time you want, get as rich as you want. This X-fan won't be there. . . . . And remember what really made JRR Tolkens Hobbit & (trilogy) really good... it did come to an end. Even Mark Twain new that Huck Finn had to grow up, and couldn't keep going and going. ... thanks for the early books."
4,Sympathy for the Devil,"Speaking as an evil villain, I feel that the great Lord of the Dark has been getting a bum rap in these books. Hey, c'mon, he's been walled up for eons; how would YOU feel? Some of my best friends are Myrdraal; although I don't care much for trollocs unless they've been well-cleaned before cooking. Rand et al seem like very intelligent people; why can't they see that the Darkfriends have their best interests at heart? Judging by the way this book is bleeding to death I'd say the Darkfriends are winning. Is Terry Brooks ghost-writing this episode? Snore....still it's a rich, deep fantasy world, even for an omnipotent superman power-trip. Take a chance, Jordan. DO something soon. You're drawing too much tainted saidin from your 'fans.' Finish it, THEN compare yourself to old JRR."
2,Very slow reading,"I'm a very fast reader, and the first four books in the series zoomed by, and after that I was beginning to get sick of the repeatedness, the same metaphors and descriptions being used over and over. We the readers all understand that in Tel'aran'rhoid women's dresses keep changing when they think of their beloved. Speaking of women, why is it almost all the women are exactly the same??? Being a girl myself, I'm not complaining about the fact that Jordan makes in look like the women always have the men under control, but why can't we have a female who isn't unusually pretty or unusually strong in the Power?This book, like the last (though it was decent--Mat was in it) is very slow reading. I've been reading it on and off for the last few weeks. It has really gotten nowhere, I'm losing track of characters, AND WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT HOW MAT IS DOING???I apologize for the harsh review, but it seems to me Jordan has lost his enthusiasm or something..."
3,"Too much Ballard, not enough America","Too much Ballard and not enough America. I guess after the success of the Russ Ballard written ""You Can Do Magic"" the previous year, they figured if a little Ballard is a good thing, more Ballard would be even better! They were wrong. This is one of their weaker albums. America (Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell) only wrote or co-wrote 4 of the songs while the bulk are Ballard songs. It does contain some good songs including their last top 40 hit, ""The Border"" from 1983, and I also like ""Tonight is for Dreamers"" and ""She's a Runaway."" But as a whole, this was a letdown after their excellent ""View from the Ground"" album."
3,Not Bad,"Not bad, but not one of their better efforts. This album is more a Russ Ballard work than America. He produced it and was involved in writing 7 of the songs, while America was only involved in writing 4 songs. Contains their last top 40 hit to date, The Border. Best album cuts: Tonight Is For Dreamers, She's A Runaway, and Love's Worn Out Again. Could have used more Dewey Bunnell and Gerry Beckley, and less Ballard."
5,Another Gem,"I am never disappointed by each new song that this man produces, not to mention the album as a whole, and the order in which he puts all these tasty morsels. Not a huge departure from what we're all familiar with, however, he appears to be leaning more toward the melodic and songstyling over the expermental noise drops - I think he's got that down pat! All good."
4,"LXIII is 63, not 73","This album is good, but not as great as some of his previous works under the Prefuse moniker or otherwise. Unlike many, I felt Silence was a great album, and received too much flak for not being Extinguisher Pt. 2 (3 if you count Extinguished).I must admit I didn't get ""Creating Cyclical Headaches,"" which I feel is almost unlistenable, save for the bits at the beginning and very end; which is too bad because I nearly jumped out of my skin with excitement when I saw that it was a collaboration with Four Tet."
3,B side vibe,"SS comes replete with schizzy examples of why the instrumental hip-hop producer was so initially intriguing, but the whole thing can't help but exhibit a disconnected and incomplete package."
5,I agree - a 20th century masterpiece,"This is a stunning and brilliant literary achievement, which I'm happy to see is still in print. Its style corresponds to the Cubist movement of the times. Perhaps a literary approach inspired by Picasso. This is a treat not to be missed."
1,Forgettable,"I just had to write in on this one because this novel exasperated me!On the surface this looks like a good novel-some stunning writing,lovely descriptive passages and of course it is technically assured-so why didn't I like it?It's taken me a while to answer this one and I think the answer lies somewhere in the fact that I don't really care about the characters.To boot there are some really forced characterisations (such as Narouz)and there are times when I feel Durrell is not in control of the material.The freaky people in the novel are just that -freaky and uninteresting ,unlike say in Proust where they lend incredible resonance to the plot.For all the touted technical delivery and supposedly exotic location this novel is ultimately very flat and empty.Forgettable."
2,I Must Have Missed Some Footnotes,"While Justine was certainly well-written, I have rarely had a more difficult time sorting out the relationships among a small cast of characters and understanding their past histories. Durrell offers his reader no assistance whatsoever, tossing off references to events and individuals as if we are all magically in-the-know. I kept flipping backward and forward, expecting someone or something to be explained, and finally realized I was on my own in Alexandria with no guidebook. I was left with no desire to move on to the other three novels."
1,Interesting Premise - Execrable Execution,"The premise of this work is to tell the same story from four different viewpoints to demonstrate the role of the narrator in fiction - it would have helped enormously if there'd been a story to tell from the beginning.Instead, we're treated to a fantastically dull narration of an incredibly mundane and ordinary sequence of nothing-really-happening, and to add spite to injury, when done once, we must traverse the same static space of lack of events three more times, told from very subtly different viewpoints, not really doing much for the original premise.The idea is very interesting and could have been a marvellous work - instead its entire lack of a story to tell leaves one with the feeling that it could have been done much, much better. As it is now, it one of the most incredibly boring books I've ever read."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I kept digging and digging, but all I found under the sands of Alexandria was more sand. Not nearly as breathtaking as I had expected."
5,A PASION FRUIT,Well... i read the Alexandrea Quartet many years ago and i was completely amazed by the way Durrell could recreate the real and external world of a group of friends who lives in Alexandria while their internal peregrination. In my opinion the best characters are Justine and Clea. And not because i am a woman but because they are sharp and also round and full of shades. Eventhough you can read each book separeted it is much better if you read the whole quartet.
3,S'awright,"I was so anticipating a great read when I ordered this, but it wasnt all that good. A lot 'lighter' than I anticipated. It wasnt horrible, but not worth as much money as I spent. Dont get this one unless you can get it under $5."
2,Don't Read the Back Cover.,Someone should write a horror story about the back cover. That's the enticing vocabulary that lured me to purchase this boring compilation. Nothing noteworthy or outstanding. *YAWN*
3,Adult conflicts through children's eyes,"If you are looking for a fresh, new look at ""The Troubles,"" this is the book. I found the book to be disturbing because all three of the stories centered on children and their peripheral involvement in the North. In each of the stories the adults were too caught-up in the day-to-day difficulties they encountered due to the circumstances. None of the children written about were understood nor were their feelings and concerns acknowledged. It is heart-breaking to watch how these children suffer without the parental-figures in their lives even realizing the impact the war is having on the children."
1,Update it already!,"Pretty sad, really. Rather than go to the time and trouble of releasing a new edition for PostgreSQL 9, O'Reilly tries pawning off an ebook version of a *10 year* old book - covering a version of PostgreSQL more than 2 major releases behind current (2011-2012) tech. Pitiful."
3,In response to LXP,"As co-author of the book, I would like to ask what people like and don't like about the book. As we prepare to do a revision in the next 12 months it is important for us to understand our readers.Comments like, this strange thing called LXP don't help us as LXP was only 40 pages of a 636 page book.Comments like, hey I would have to like to see more on JDBC or Administration are helpful.Thanks to all who purchase the book."
3,I don't know if the book is limited or if it's the database,"I am using PostgreSQL after having used MySQL for years. Even though PostgreSQL has some nice advance features (ACID, Transaction, Foreign Key), it lacks basic and simple features that are a breeze to use or perform on MySQL (Drop Column, modify columns and tables)."
2,big disappointment,"I was hoping to finally get a good book on PostgreSQL. I guess I'll keep waiting. Want specifics? The index is entirely useless (3 pages for 600+ pages of book). Incomplete data type listing and description (at least I haven't found any discussion of the old large object handling or the bytea type yet). Good things? While easily found elsewhere (like in the included documentation for PostgreSQL), the chapters on PostgreSQL Administration are adaquate as is the chapter on postgresql clients. The advert...err..chapter on LXP is pretty much fluff, as is the command reference that takes up the last hundred or so pages, thus reducing the useful pagecount to about 450."
1,Worst O'Reilly book ever written,This is definitely the worst book by O'Reilly I have ever seen. It is an advertisment for a strange thing called LXP but nothing more. I love PostgreSQL and I have used it for years but this book is absolutely inadequate. It does not go into detail and is absolutely no use for somebody who wants to work with the database professionally.I cannot recommend this book.
3,Practical PostgreSQL (O'Reilly Unix),"This book is good for a novice.To fit to the title they gave to the book, there should be more in depth discussion about the architecure of the postgresql. It totally misses the LARGS OBJECTS(LOBs) in this book. I do know that there is LOBs feature in Postgresql. If it hade covered about the applicability of LARGE OBJECTS, their limitation, it would have been better.That is why i gave 3 star to this book."
3,Written ages ago,"This book used to be a good reference for PostgreSQL 7.4. However there is much more to PostgreSQL nowadays then it was six years ago.This book has a problem that I guess most SQL books suffer from. It has a very long introduction to SQL itself. Which is not bad if you are a complete beginner. The book is somewhat boring to read, without that additional value because of which you buy a book. It lacks additional information on advanced PostgreSQL features, programming in PL/pgsql, replication, administration and some other interesting topics. On the other hand it's not that ""practical"" but rather a PostgreSQL reference.All in all this book has too much reference which makes it hard to read. With that and the fact it is somewhat outdated, you might want to decide on skipping it."
2,Story unsuitable,The rolling eyes are cute but the story is expressed in such a complicated way that nobody understands what the heck is going on. Bravo for the drawing and the eyes but boooooooo for the text !
5,Kids Love It!,"I bought this book for my 2 grandsons, age 3 and 1, and they both love it. The book is a very well made board book for the little one and the moving ""eyes"" fascinate them both. I first saw the book in a doctor's office and laughed, I thought it was so funny. I wrote down the publisher and ordered it on-line with another companion book."
5,Great little book,Our grandchildren ages 4 & 2 are coming to visit & this will be a fun book to read with them.
4,sinus helper,The Himalayan inhaler is great. Seems to help my sinus problems and has stopped me from coughing. Easy to use. I just don't use it for 20 minutes at a time but try to use it several times a day.
5,Himalayan Crystal Salt Inhaler really works,"I found that this product really works well in making breathing much easier when I'm suffering from allergy and/or asthma symptoms. The order process was great, and I received the package very quickly. Very happy with this purchase."
2,After five days of use very little sign of any improvement...,"In my or my wife's condition related to bronchitis. Perhaps it works for allergy situations, but I would not recommend if you are looking for relief from cold symptoms. Granted the cold I have is particularly nasty with regard to coughing, even so..had I seen a couple more reviews like mine I feel like I would have though twice before pursing this solution."
3,Salt inhaler,Not really sure if I am experiencing any results. My daughter bought the same item online for half the price
1,Salt Inhaler,This whole salt routine with inhaler is a joke. It does not work! Do not buy it! Total waste of money!
1,Not Worth It,"I struggle with allergies and asthma, and with everything I've tried, I thought 'why not give this a shot?' Big mistake. Seriously, it is so much better to take the trip to the coast for fresh salt air (esp. the Atlantic). This product did absolutely nothing for me."
1,Rating for the product alone,"I'm sorry I bought it. First the ceramic container is not sealed. I wiped it off but I was hesitant to put that in my mouth. Amazon was sold out so I bought it with a seller through Amazon but he was higher priced than Amazon so technically I paid for shipping. I bought this for better immunity or shorter colds but all it is doing is drying and irritatng my throat. My doctor told me to stop using it when I told her about it. Was it a good investment ? NO!!! Save your money. If you must, gargle with warm salt water. It's a lot cheaper."
1,BUMMER!,"Does not work...does nothing at all. I called the company and they said it is not for bronchial/ nasal problems, only MIGHT help with deep breathing diseases like emphysema,etc.On the Dr. Oz Show it was presented as a way to clear bronchial/ nasal passages...not so according to the company and the fact of no results/improvement at all. Waste of money...and I also bought an extra package of salt.Boo on Dr. Oz.!!!!"
2,Himalayan Crystal Salt Inhaler,"I didn't buy this for myself, but for my son. He didn't like it, but he is very skeptical of most things, so this isn't a proper review."
4,inhaler,Pretty cool device.Only problem is getting the plug off to refill it. Its on pretty good and run the risk of damaging it if you slip.
3,Hard to breathe through,I should have anticipated that it would be hard to breathe through. My mouth and cheek muscles cramp after a while.
2,salt inhaler,who the hell has time to due this for 10 mins a day like it says to. its in the trash. maybe help someone with more sinus problems. not a fan
2,Salt Inhaler,"I am a bit skeptical on the benefits of this salt inhaler; however, it's worth a try. The reason why is that I've read that it benefitted those who were physically in big caves containing this salt, so I'm unsure how this little device will benefit. Therefore, I can't say yet if it has any benefit at this time which is why my rating. However, I did receive the item very quickly and as described."
1,Not worth reading,"I have to agree with the recent review, This book is worth exactly what you pay for, NOTHING,it is very poorly written, nothing you already know or can find out on the web. Save your Time and do things you love in your retirement."
5,A comprehensive review of this subject,A book that gives you comprehensive ideas on the physical picture of brittle fracture
4,Clueless,"THIS MOVIE ROCKS! I have loved this movie since I was 13 and I'm 17 now. I have tons of favorite parts but I would have to say my most favorite part was the part when Cher meets Tai. She thought she loved Christian but of course she really didn't, she loved someone else, but if I tell you it was you won't want to see the movie.The girl that played Cher in the TV show was alright, but Alicia Sliverstone, in my opinion IS Cher.A great movie that all teens can enjoy...TOTALLY! Hehe just had to add that in."
5,LIKE NO OTHER MOVIE..better than all!!!!!,This movie is the best..I have its dvd and i have been watching it over and over maybe 10 times..It is a very good movie and not like any other clueless type movies.BEST!!BEST!!BEST!!Alicia Silverstone and Stacey Dash are very beautiful and attractive..The cast is good the script is marvellous.. YOU LL LOVE IT!!!!!!!! BEST of all!!!!!!!!
4,Whatever!,I think this is such a great comedy and defenetley a gret video! I think it was so cool It gave me a mind of my own and from now on I think of Whatever! I think you'll love this video because it's about valley mall girls who are sorta like rich snobs. It's hilarious! a must buy video that is perfect for a teen.
3,laughed my head off!!!,"I really liked this film; it's not very deep or anything, but not all films have to teach you a whole lot. I thought it was very funny indeed, at times I almost laughed my head off!!! I thought Cher's change of character was really adorable, and the way she suddenly realizes she's in love with her stepbrother....just LOVELY, suddenly she's very vulnerable and that makes her very sweet. I did not realize at the time that the film was based on Emma, it did have an oddly familiar ring to it, but I never knew what it was. Anyway, now that I know, it makes the film even better!! The humour in it was very witty at times, the satire never cruel! GREAT FILM!!!"
3,Enjoyable to watch.,"Clueless has always been an enjoyable movie to watch. I've seen it quite a few times and consider it to be a good teen comedy. The acting by the entire cast is entertaining and solid. Alicia Silverstone especially does a nice job in her role as Cher. There are some funny scenes throughout the film, and I also think that the plot is pretty good. Clueless moves at a steady pace, and the film's dialogue is energetic and interesting. I think that Clueless is put together pretty well. I don't think that it's boring, either. This is a satisfying movie that is fun to watch."
5,Funny Romantic Comedy Based On A Classic Novel,"I loved this movie when I was young. And when I watched it again recently, it was still fun. The concept of the movie was clever. It closely follows a similar plot to Jane Austen's Emma, but with a modern twist. Chere is a compelling main character. I thought it was funny how she ended up continually causing problems for herself and others by trying to make her own life and the lives of others better. Her growth in the story was believable to me, and I enjoyed her romantic subplot."
5,This movie brings back such good memories!,"I love this movie so much, it was one of my favs as a kid and is still funny and adorable. Anyone who doesn't like this movie, in my opinion is missing out on alot."
5,a laugh-out loud comedy for all ages.,This is very funny movie that will take you back to high school agian and make you realize just how stupid that time of your life was
5,A rich girl from Beverly Hills realizes from close relations,a very realistic movie with great characters.a movie that reflects our time.
1,A full on monet............................,"Bad acting (if it can be called that), from Alicia et al - save Brittany Murphy who seems to be the one 'baldwin' amongst the monets. It was a humourless movie - were we supposed to laugh or something at Alicia's irritating whiny voice, and bad one-liners? Okay, if Alicia's such a 'great actress', then where is she now? Oh yeah, she made that 'gem' of a movie - Excess Baggage (what a bundle of laughs that was) and she also made that 'hilarious' comedy - Blast From The Past (make me barf).Don't waste time or money, or even review space, giving this pile of crap more stars than it's worth (shame I couldn't give it nought - but then again, the one star is for Britanny Murphy)."
4,Clueless... uhhh,"What can I say about this movie? It's like any other teenage movie, about teenagers in high school trying to meet cute guys and stuff. Same old thing! I used to not like it at the beginning, but now I sorta like it, it's alright. I got it as a present for my 8th grade birthday party, I didn't even know that movie until I got it. So anyways, I think you should buy this movie even if you dont like teenager movies, youll like this one!"
4,HOLDING OUT FOR LUKE PERRY,"Ten years after its initial release, CLUELESS maintains its charm in its honest depiction of teen angst during the mid-nineties. Alicia Silverstone is radiantly impressive as Cher, a soon to be 16 year old whose main focus in life seems to be her clothing and her matchmaking skills. Silverstone never comes across as truly obnoxious, though, and she seems to really be in to the mechanisms that went into making a cell-phone oriented teen. Stacey Dash and Brittany Murphy are perfect as her comrades, and Paul Rudd is handsome and charming as Cher's step brother. A strong supporting cast of adults including Dan Hedaya, Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplin are also good in their ""older folks"" roles. Although CLUELESS is rarely plot-driven, it is merely an examination of a whole new class of youngsters, and it is Silverstone's performance that anchors the film and supplies the impetus for an overall entertaining romp."
4,Overall fun movie,"This is such a great, girlie movie. It's the perfect movie to watch when you've had brain overload and don't want to think anymore. This movie pokes fun at the stereotypical Beverly Hills kids. You'll see kids in school with bandages on their faces from recently done nose jobs, endless BMW's and countless shopping trips. This is a fun movie!"
4,FUN!,"If you like Clueless this is a cool copy to own because of the bonus features. It has some interviews with the cast (from recently! perhaps 2004-05? talking about their experience- obviously they're much older, experienced (some haven't been in any prominent roles since then...) so it's really interesting to see what they had to say.This movie is a classic. The jokes are so subtle at times, I didn't remember how funny this movie was. There are a lot of jokes I never understood when I saw this film when I younger that I appreciate and understand much more. At the same time, I wouldn't not recommend younger audiences to see it. There's nothing extreme.Pretty light-hearted film. It doesn't really leaving you asking yourself any meaningful, philosophical questions but it is very entertianing."
5,Timeless,"As long as there are clics, young men and women trying to find their place in this world, this movie will remain timeless."
4,"a sublte re-,make of Jane Austen's Emma","the video was funny in itself, but I can't imagine really enjoying it without knowing what they've based it on. The reviewer that coommented on the refinement of Emma's language, should have anothr go at reading Jane Auten. Every single sentence has got a secret drawer, a double bottom, a dig, a sublesneer. but people were so dependent on society, she couldn't afford ever to say what whe really thought. Even this hidden nastiness is represented in Cueless, and while a film shouldn't be dependent upon knowledge of a book, no high school teacher should deprive her/his students of that great ""one-up-manship of ""getting"" jokes no body else is likely to. Great film."
5,I think I wet myself laughing!!!,"This movie was hilarious. I really enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. My props go to the director and the entire cast of ""Clueless"". Especially to the two stars of the movie."
5,One very good movie!,"Clueless is the ultimate teen comedy for the 90's and will be a classic forever. Great script, great acting, great music, great direction, etc. Anyone who sees this film and tries to take it too seriously is obviously missing the whole point. Alicia Silverstone carries this film like no one else could. I could watch this movie over and over again. BUY IT NOW!!!"
5,classic!,can't help but love this movie and the music is great too. It's fun seeing all these stars before they grew up.
4,very entertaining,"I was in the mood for a no-brainer and I wanted to smile and be entertained. This fit the bill. Cher is an adorable character. I loved the clothes, shoes and cars. Not entirely without merit. There's a moral in here somewhere."
3,Fun,"I always enjoy this movie. It was fun to watch it again after so many years, and it was just as playful as I remembered."
5,LOVE this movie!,"I really love this movie! I am so bummed I didn't own it sooner, but glad to have this edition. The extras were so funny!"
4,sweet!,"this was, like, the most awesomest thing they could have ever done to commemmorate the most awesome movie on the planet! i was a little dissappointed that there werent any deleted scenes or anything, thats why i only gave it like 4 stars... but it was awesome to see all the extras, and all the info about the book, and movie and stuff...."
1,Depressing,This is just another example of how the teen market is being exploited by 50 year old studio executives. It is hard to watch teenagers laugh at somthing that is making fun of them. It saddens me to see teens setting goals to be like charachters that are steriotypical teenage trash.
1,"BAD WRITING, BAD STORY, = ONE HECKAVA BAD MOVIE",I saw CLUELESS and after seeing it I actually thought that the director and writers of this film were CLUELESS about making any kind of a decent film. I mean ALICIA SILVERSTONE has got to give one of the worst acting performances ever in a movie as does the rest of the lame-brained cast. So my advice is skip CLUELESS I know I wished I had!!!
1,Clueless is humorless.,"Just because this movie is a modernization of Emma does not excuse it for being as funny as an episode of Mad about You -- it's not funny.Maybe if Silverstone showed a little more skin, this movie would have some redeeming value. Alas, it did not, and I give this movie one star, although it'd be better if there was an option for zero or negative stars."
1,The writers must have been Clueless!!!!!,"Holy smoke! This movie is awful! Scriptwise, actingwise and everything else........just awful. Who wants to go see a movie about some snobbish, clueless, wealthy teens?"
1,I'm clueless...,"I'm clueless of what this movies is about ! It tries to be a comedy, but is not funny at all; it tries to criticize the rich people a little bit, but it fails miserably. The story is so empty that it made me nervous. A terrible waste of time."
2,American phrases used annoyed me. Funny film though.,"This film is really not my type. All the repetitive phrases used in the film really annoyed me. ""O Puleeeese!"" (O Please), ""As Iiiiff"" (As if) ""Whateverrrrr"" (Whatever), ""Helloooo"" (Hello). It made me want to vomit all over my computer.It had some funny moments. I can credit it for that and the acting was very good. But in all of these teenage, American programmes and films, the American phrases really annoy me."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Clueless is a bit too willing to embrace the formulaic conventions of the genre, for the majority of its running length it's a smart and funny teen movie."
2,WHATEVERRRR!,This movie was so 'totally' stupid. The show is even worse. The only reason worth watching is to see what clothes you would like to buy. The high school is so fictional! Everyone in Bervely Hills in high school does not carry a cell phone and all the girls aren't always into the mirror. The fact that Cher's and Dione's dork outreach program flipped on them shows they can't dress anyone else but their ownselves. They act so ditzy it makes me want to puke!!! The moral of the movie is.....WHATEVER!
2,Who cares?,"Who cares about a posh little who*e who doesn't like the way people look and tries to ""correct""them to her liking ? Who does she think she is?Alfred Einstein? this moviis for little runts and not for anyone who know realism from fantasy."
4,"A ""Better"" Edition","Recently a lot of DVDs that were released back when DVDs were first introduced on the market are coming out with new editions. This is good news since those early releases came with little in the way of special features. It seems the studios just didn't think about bounus material then.But now, I guess because those features have become so popular, they've decided rerelease many of those films on DVD.So in addition to this witty comedy, you get an inside look at what went into the making of it ten years after it's release. Though Alicia Silvertone is missing from the new bounus material (except for onset interview footage from 1995), I found writer/director Amy Heckerlings interview footage insightful in particular."
5,Excellent,"excellent quality, came much earlier than expected, excellent edition of a classic comedy, very good edition, recommended. Excelente que viene con subtitulos en espeañol, un clasico que todos deben tener !"
5,Great fluffy movie,This movie always makes me feel happy and all the lines are totally quoteable and it's definitely the kind of movie that never gets old to watch.
5,Hilariously Amazing!!,"I love this movie!! It is literally a laugh out loud chick flick that every man, woman, and child needs to let warm your heart for years to come!"
4,Funny parody of Cali life,"Clueless is just a really funny movie about teens in Beverly Hills. Cher and Dionne have such a skewed outlook on life and relationships that it's ridiculous. Cher's attempts at doing good deeds include matchmaking, charity work and helping a new girl adjust to the school. I saw it when I was a teenager, so I guess I could relate to it more back then than now. Some people I know said that the characters are too prideful and shallow, but they're supposed to be! It's just a spoof of that lifestyle. It's sort of a fun, non-violent version of ""Heathers""."
5,Incredibly funny!,Clueless is an uproarious comedy! Living up to every expectation you may have. Never lacking in comedy. Great cast with flawless performances! Want a film you can't get enough of? Clueless is for you!
3,Woman's movement,"So few film good film roles go to women and so few pictures are made about women. Most movies cast women as prostitutes, wives, girlfriends or victims. CLUELESS succeeds as both an easy-going comedy and a film about an individual teen-age girl, not the girl who got picked up or victimized. Question: when the step-brother gooses Alicia Silverstone's midsection, is she slapping his hand away because she didn't like the remark about her weight or because she is ticklish?"
2,Ooh! I wonder if they have this in my size?,"Ok, so maybe I'm a guy and just don't understand these things - that's a perfectly acceptable explanation to my mind. But I found this movie extremely boring except for one tiny little line where Alicia says (thinks rather) ""Ooh! I wonder if they have that in my size?"" I found that line really funny because of its stereotypical portrayal of an American teen. I dunno, I just found the movie was dummer than ""Dumb and Dumber"". No way is it a good movie, but, hey, maybe some girl out there will like it - I know I didn't."
4,"""Classic!""","Clueless. A gem from director Amy Heckerling, the queen of teen flicks. This is one of my favorite movies. I know it is not for everyone, but I think anyone could enjoy Cher and Dionne's shrewd fashion sense, and irreverant slang. Alicia Silverstone has true talent, and yet she still agreed to act in this movie (ha ha). A modern take-off of Jane Austen's 'Emma', Clueless follows the antics of Cher and Dionne, two rich high school girls who have much in common, including the fact that they were both ""...named after old stars who now do infomercials!"" I cannot say that this movie is a classic to be treasured forever, but it certainly amuses me. If you like high school movies with memorable characters and a lot of witty charm, I definitely recommend this."
4,Even adults will love this!,"Beneath all of the mall-rat vernacular, this is a very intelligent and entertaining movie."
2,interesting...,"This movie was shallow, pointless, and ridiculous. The only reason I had finished watching it was that it was indeed based on Jane Austen's Emma. Clueless however, doesn't even come close to the literary masterpiece..."
2,A silly movie; Jane Austen fans be warned!,"I watched this movie knowing it was based on Emma- perhaps that is why I found it lacking. The people were all very attractive, and the movie was easy enough to watch - but the farce hits a bit too close to the problems kids really have today - cliques, drug use, etc. for me to laugh at them."
2,W-E-I-R-D!!!!!,Ha ha! not. they try WAAAYYY to hard to be funny. i DO NOT recommend this movie to anyone. don't waste your time.
2,Gets More Boring With Age,"I saw this in my junior year of high school. I liked the film then but watching it now makes me break out in hives. The so-called hip Beverly Hills lingo in the film is very dated now. Watching Silverstone go ( As If! ) reminds me of being back in high school but those days are over. The plot is okay though it gets lost in between Silverstone's endless wardrobe changes. This was her breakout film, why I don't know because she was better in The Crush than she could ever be in Clueless. This used to be the film that all girls, rich and poor idolized. Now it's a strained bore. But if you are a Silverstone fan and haven't seen this ( must have been buried alive somewhere if you haven't ), by all means help yourself. Just don't expect more than Silverstone struggling over worthless, old-time lingo."
5,The best film I've ever seem,"I obsess about this film all day, and it drives my friends crazy because I know the whole script off by heart and enjoy reciting it at every possible moment even if it is in the middle of an English class on my state of the art mobile phone. WHATEVER!"
3,Re-plays better in memory than reality,"I rented Clueless when it was first released on DVD. I remembered it as being funnier than it actually was when I re-watched it. It is clever, and I do enjoy Alicia Silverstone, Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, and Breckin Meyer."
5,classic movie for teens,My older daughter just introduced this movie to her younger sister. they loved it. Classic teen movie. they quote it all the time.
5,best teen movie of the 90's,"I love Clueless. It's an amazing movie based on spoiled rich kids. The main character is Cher( silverstone), who likes to help out others in the school and likes to get her way. Dion is the funniest character of them all. I like her sense of humor.Mostly a teen could relate to any of these characters. Instead of using their popularity to bring people down, they made the new girl Tie, fill welcome.I'm so happy they made a special edition for ''Clueless.'' The packaging is brillant. Most of the talking was funny. Thanks Paramount for releasing it!"
1,Such a disappointment...,"Like one of the previous reviewers stated, this looks like a good buy from the outside due to the really nice packaging and the very good movie selection. My wife and I were really looking forward to some of the movies featured on this set, especially ""Life With Father"". Oh what a terrible disappointment it was to see such TERRIBLE quality audio and video. We only made it through half the movie because it was so disheartening. The audio is horrible. Many of the lines spoken are unintelligible. The video quality was so bad it was not watchable. We took it back and left it at the store we bought it from because of the 'copyright laws that prohibit DVDs that are opened from being returned'. It was HORRIBLE! Avoid this DVD. Purchase the movies individually if you can find them."
1,Blows,Bought this set for my mom for Christmas. The quality is atrocious -- both sound and picture quality. Do not waste your money. I'm seriously thinking of returning and getting my mom something else. I can't believe people can live with themselves putting crap like this in a box and selling to unsuspecting victims.
1,Amazon you have to be joking,I think someone at Amazon need to find whoever suggested they list these atrocious prints of these movies with a new cover. In Australia these exact selections have been selling in b grade supermarkets and $2.00 shops for years. I bought one once for $2 and threw it out (kept the case of course). they are unwatchable and Amazon need to take them off the market. They are el cheapo prints of out of copyright movies. Shame Amazon Shame. PS why does one have to give at least a star to something before it will publish???
5,They don't make them like this anymore,Love good classic movies these DVDs has great ones to watch. None of the style we got in todays movies. No offense to the actors of today. But these are beautiful people without enhances. You can feel the emotions in these classics.
1,"Great Movies, Great Box, Terrible Picture and Sound","Fortunately I only picked up this box of DVDs at the library, so I didn't have to waste my money. I was excited to see such a great looking collection, but what a disappointment. I actually trudged through most of the movies, since I love the stories, but it was painful. At first I thought I had just forgotten how bad other prints of the movies looked, but after a while it was clear that they couldn't have been that bad. ""Farewell to Arms"" was just about unwatchable, and ""The Little Princess"" wasn't much better, and so on for the others. What a pity."
4,I dare you not to dance,"Speed garage, a house/drum & bass hybrid, first surfaced in Europe in the early nineties. DJ's/groups like Armand Van Heldon, 187 lockdown and Serious Danger were among the first pioneers of this hard-hitting form of dance music. With their third release, 'The Program', Serious Danger return with an album that serves as a reminder as to why speed garage caught our ears in the first place. 'The Program' is by far their best album to date and stands among their best work including their remix of 'God is a DJ' by Faithless. There really isn't a weak song on the album. Highlights include 'Hardrockin' and 'Battleplate' both of which are funky grooves that ride on basslines straight out of hell. Speed Garage isn't for everyone. It's much more aggressive than traditional house. However, if you're interested in checking it out, 'The Program' is an excellent place to start. Similar Groups/DJ's: Gant, Natural Born Chillers, DJ Sneak."
5,GREAT MOVIE....GREAT SERVICE !!,"""THIS CHRISTMAS"" is a very heartwarming movie with excellent performances by all of the actors and actresses. For us baby boomers, it brings back memories of the old family dinners during the holidays and those infamous Sunday dinners. The plot is very basic but still holds you in suspense for the final ending. I watched it twice and will probably watch it again. The ""Soul Train"" dance line, at the end, is fun! It's a ""must have"" movie that can be viewed anytime but had special meaning for me ""this Christmas"""
5,I always enjoy this movie,this show has all the aspects of a dysfunctional family. Yet all the great things about love and being there for others.
5,Truly A Great Touching Movie,"The whole cast was great, especially Chris Brown & Columbus Smart (another movie together) hand claps. If this movie don't remind you or yours of some Christmas experiences maybe past or present. Great movie REALLY!"
5,Family,That's what CHRISTMAS is about ----- FAMILY. Everytime i watch this movie; I always cry. Enjoying each others' company and putting your differences aside that's the making a LOVING family.
4,A DAMN GOOD MOVIE,THIS PICTURE WAS A SURPRISE TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY GO FOR XMAS MOVIES. BUT THIS WAS A GOOD ONE. WITH SOME REALLY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN IT.EVEN MS DEVINE TURNED ME ON.I RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL MEN WHO LIKE A SEXY MOVIE WITH TASTE.AND TO THE WOMEN SO THEY CAN SEE WHAT A REAL MAN IS TRULY LIKE. AND MAYBE THEY CAN SEE BEYOND HE SO CUTE CRAP.
5,Love Regina King and Loretta Devine!,"I had this on DVD and came across it on Blu-Ray for a great price so thought why not? We watched again last night as we just purchased a sound bar for our TV and it magnified the great movie 100 fold! Great cast, great story line and GREAT music make this for our family an awesome addition to our holiday watch list!"
4,Quality Family Film,"This movie hits a lot of wickets that families deal with and lets you know that Chris Brown can do so much better than just hold a note. Good cast, good chemistry which makes a good movie. My family enjoyed it."
4,Luv this movie!,"""This Christmas"" is one of my favorite feel good movies during the holidays. I've had to endure commercials and/or it not being shown in HD. The right price for the right movie! Very fast delivery."
5,my feedback,THIS MOVIE WAS JUST WHAT I WANT'ED IT;T ARRIVED IN GOOD SHAPE AND IT'T PLAY'S EVEN BETTER.THANK'S MOVIE MARS.SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE.AND MY COPY WAS A NEW ONE TOO.
3,"THIS CHRISTMAS,.","THE ONLY PROBLEM IT WASN'T IN A HARD CASE, BUT IT GOT TO ME SAFE AND UNHARMED. OTHER THEN THAT NO PROBLEM, GREAT PICTURE.AFRI"
3,It was just ok,"I didn't see this at the movies, so I couldn't wait for it to come out on dvd. It finally came out yesterday, and I ran to the red box rentals to get it. I was disappointed. It is not a bad movie, but I heard so much ""hype"" about the movie, I expected more. I expected something along the lines of ""Soul Food"", but it doesn't even come close.So to put this review in a nutshell, would I buy the movie, NO. Would I rent it, YES."
2,"""This Christmas""","I was very disappointed,this happened to be my favorite movie and i was only able to watch half of the movie,and then it started saying ""this movie is taking longer than expected please try again later""...im not happy at all"
2,Where is the color?,I enjoyed this movie very much in the theater version. The dvd from amazon.com was very disappointing because it is in black and white not in color.
1,Didn't like it / couldn't even finish it,I watched more than 1/2 this movie but I could never get into it at all - I am surprised it got good reviews on Amazon. Try 'Perfect Christmas' instead.
