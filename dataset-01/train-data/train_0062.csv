1,"Broke in less than a month, don't waste your time or $$$$$","Not worth the money. Under normal use, wearing it on my belt :-) duh, it broke in less than a month. The plastic pin that allows you to swivel the holster is the weak link. The case itself is great, soft leather but the cheap plastic swivel design is poor. Go buy a Blackberry Silicone Skin case instead to protect the blackberry and then pick up an after market cheap holster at Wal Mart and you'll be much happier.."
5,Best 8100 pearl holder out there... well worth the less than $10 paid,"great looking, durable and has the auto turn-off feature that eliminates the need to manually switch off the unit in meetings etc by just inserting it into the holder... great value and tastefully designed."
5,Great cell phone holster - generic enouch for most small cell phones,"This is a great cell phone holster. I use it with generic flip phones. This holster supports cell phones that are approximately 2 inches wide and up to 4 inches tall. The holster has panels that stretch making it easy to adapt to most phones.FYI, I ordered this unit from WebTreo. They sent me a wider version which was 2.5 inches wide. It was a lot of hassle getting hold of the seller to get the exchange made. Two weeks later I received the correct unit."
2,this case is annoying!!,this case is really tight ( for my pearl 8100) and bulky. I switched back to the original case i got with the phone. The material on the sides (rough PE) is abrasive enough that it leaves fine lines on the phone when you pull the phone in and out of this case. Don't be too dazzled by the leather on the front and back like the other users.
5,Great OEM Quality,"Exact OEM replacement in Delco packaging. Finally, went back to OEM after Autozone replacements kept failing in 20k miles.Sometimes it's better to spend the litte extra"
3,"Rafi One Light, One Sun","This is a great album of adventures.We take walks, go bowling and Things To DO!Have a nice TRIP!"
5,Never get tired of this CD,My on was one when we bought this and he is six now and still loves it. His dad and I love it too
5,Magic of Music,"This album has many of Raffi's popular songs: from ""One Light, One Sun"", ""Down on Granpa's Farm"", ""Tingalayo"", ""Like me, Like you"" and many more. Each song is uniquely different except Raffi's signature elements of humor, joy and harmony. This magical CD has 2 cheerful garden songs (""Octopus's Garden"", ""In My Garden""), 2 famous international songs suitable for children (""Fais Dodo"", ""De Colores""), and 2 exercise songs (""Walk Outside"" and ""The Bowling Song""). There is a trip to the farm where kids will ""see"" lots of animals. There is a trip to the garden where they ""plant"" seeds of flowers and enjoy fruits of ""Apples and Bananas"". The best part is the kids will ""Ride in an Airplane"" with Raffi to visit children around the globe and discover that this CD celebrating children is a song sung by all."
4,The TeenTeacher,"This story takes place along time ago when people had wooden houses in Avonlea in the country. It is important because it shows you how people lived back then and how Anne became a teacher at 16 (that wouldn't happen today).This book is mostly about a 16 year old that wants to became a teacher at her old school. But some of her friends have different punishments for the children and about weird nabor that has a problem with change and a another nabor that has an adatude problem and it is funny,sad,and educational.In my opinion this book is an ok book I did not really understand it because their were allot of difficult words but the the things I could read were great thats why I gave it 4 stars.I would recemend this book because it was a great book and it tells you how it would be like to be a 16 year old teacher"
3,"Good, but could be better","This album is brutal, very metal, i suggest getting this last in your collection, get Wage of Sin first, or Burning Bridges, this just isnt as good. Best tracks are Cosmic Retribution and Aces High(Iron Madien cover)"
5,"great book, go buy it","i don't like bush at all, and i don't like the way he makes texans look; even though he isn't really a texan, he was born in conneticut. do yourself a favor, and buy this book."
4,More Unflattering Facts About Bush,"Enlightening, well-organized book concerning George W's (lack of) service in the National Guard. Documention included to prove that George W. did whatever he wanted to do, and was allowed to get away with it. And then this shirker was elected president! There are those who just refuse to see the truth right in front of them."
3,Clarification,"Mr. Tom Shepherd of El Monte,CA should remember that Mr. Clinton lied about sex. This is hardly up there with lying about war and peace or phony-baloney drug benefits for seniors. As the bumper sticker says, ""When Clinton lied, nobody died."""
1,"Terrible, full of Liberal Lies, I wish I could give it minus five stars","While author pursue very Liberal agenda, he has no talent to describe, or logically lead discussion. In the book he is spewing hate toward his fellow Texan. I think, George W made own share of mistakes, but he did mostly what he believe in, also he had to deal with biggest terrorist act in US history. He had to rebuild CIA, FBI, and all branches of military to fix the harm that was done by Clinton by cutting intelligence and military budgets. Obviously, he had more class than Barak Hussein. He did not blame Clinton for anything that went wrong with his presidency."
1,Shameless Political Nonesense,"No doubt written from the same typewritter CBS used for it's forged memos used in the 60 Minutes show. This is a transparent attempt to steal the amazing popularity of ""Unfit for Command"" a best seller by John O'Niell and Joe Corsi."
1,"Such a very inventive, creative title & jacket ...NOT!!!","Glenn Smith is a repulsive, swarmy, crappy LITTLE man! There is not ONE iota of originality, creativity in this trash-piece!Why would anyone give some slimeball that STEALS the book title, the jacket cover, the entire concept of the book a second thought...let alone a dime of reward for his deceptive thievery?!?Appears no one except the desperate of the left wing loonies that do absolutely nothing more than sit on their butts all day throwing mud from any source, hoping some might stick, do! They certainly never read, let alone purchase a book...need more proof? This latest cesspool sets at #7555 on Amazon's book list! ROFLMAO!!!Oh, and I told you so, Amazon...these liberals you've curled up with, cozied up to...don't/won't keep your bills paid!!! ;-)Excuse me, I now must go make another donation to the Swift Vets!!! <G>"
3,Good for Beginners,"I found a bit of the information on guides in this book inaccurate or conflicting. However, the author seems to be more familiar in working with angels than guides and offers a great deal of useful and helpful exercises and techniques for connecting and building a stronger relationship between ""worlds"".I rated a 3 because I found the ""working with guides"" part of the book to be a bit misleading and didn't feel very much information was provided in that aspect.In ""working with angels"" there are many great detailed exercises, charts, and organized lists of angel names and hierarchies. Much of this information, namely the exercises can be slightly modified (if at all) to apply to guides as well.Overall, a well written, easy to read book that is great for any beginner or anyone looking to learn more about angels."
1,1 Star too many,"I too am terribly disappointed with this video. The animation looks amateurish, the video looks dated and the toys featured look cheap and tacky. Unlike the toys featured in the Baby Einstein series, I'd probably never buy any of these.And this video is supposed to be developmentally sound, but it must be based on outdated developmental theories. My children are not at all captivated by the video, and although they are in the age range for this and the other products, they are so far beyond the level of these videos that they have no interest in watching them. They literally left the room last time I tried to play it for them.This product is so far inferior to anything in the Baby Einstein line that they should not even be listed in the same category. I do not recommend them. In fact, I am returning the video I bought."
1,Not worth the money,"My five month-old daughter loves the Baby Einstein videos, but I wanted to add some variety to our viewing. I saw an advertisement for these videos in a baby magazine and thought they might be worth a try. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The fact that the music is an actual orchestra instead of the synthesized/rearranged music of the Baby Einstein videos was nice, but the video was BORING. My daughter who sits in total rapture at a Baby Einstein video cried after the first 5 mintues. I think it would have been nicer to see many more animals (which babies love) rather than tons of shots of a tractor and farm equipment. Yes, it's great that the equipment is seen, but really - the kids like the animals! I would not recommend this video. It's not worth the money."
3,"Apex ""I AM DIABETIC"" Necklace","The quality of the necklace is OK, but the words ""I AM DIABETIC"" need to be bigger. I am afraid in case of an emergency a First Responder might not see them."
2,Diabetic Jewelry,"It serves the purpose, but it seemed to me that the image was a lot prettier and sparklier than it turned out to be. I wear it UNDER my shirt since it does not compliment anything I wear."
4,"""...Don't Sleep on that ""Non Fiction"" hit by Black Sheep...""","""Non Fiction"" by dres and Mr. Lawgne, epitomizes the curse of the sophomore album, and the maturity of talents that often develop in this crucial stage of an artist(s) career. Mr. Lawgne displays a much more jazzier side to his production, which still retains a certain grittiness. Dres's rhymes are much more introspective on this set, but, unfortunately, occasional non sequitur tangents detract from the cohesion of some songs. With the exception of a couple tracks, the party vibe is much more toned down on ""Non Fiction"", thus allowing for Dres and Lawgne to elaborate on their skills in ways that are not evident on ""A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing"". Like many follow-up albums, ""Non Fiction"" has its hits and misses. However, there is enough material to satisfy original fans, and to quite possibly capture a new audience that digs in the crates for noteworthy, mid-nineties hiphop."
4,"HMMMMM, I DON'T KNOW","now for me, i did not enjoy this one as much as the first one. everytime i hear this, i think of JINGLE JANGLE. it's like it's a cool vibe, but iu just don't dig it as much. it's not bad, but it's not good. now AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL is a wonderful first song. i can without NORTHSOUTHEASTWEST. WE BOYS with that group, leigon, was alright. other than that, listening to this makes me yearn for A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING. still, i'd rather listen to this than unk or young joc or rick ross anyday. again, i guess i'm just an old-fashioned cat."
4,The Series Pilot,"This is worth purchasing, but only if have no intention of buying the entire series - season 1.This is the essential pilot to the Highlander TV series. While the series would ultimately thrive, and put some of the highest quality, best written and produced shows on TV, this was the beginning. Hard core fans of the show may find this somewhat simple, or even predictable. But the story moves along well, and it's nice to see both Adrian Paul and Christopher Lambert on screen together. Their interaction is good, the training sword fights between them surprisingly good, and Lambert seems to be both enjoying himself, and getting much more into the role of Conner than he did in the dreadful sequels (2&3 that is). But the star here is, and ultimately would be, Paul, who showed he could carry the series, and a very meaningful role.A good beginning to a fantastic series."
4,"I could have been five, but it fell short","I loved reading this book, I thought Rose was a great character, she was funny, sarcastic and tough when it needed done. But, Declan was such a big whiny baby. Could it be more about him?! Yes, fame and fortune come with a price, but hey people seem to live with it. He acted like he was the only one that this had ever happend to. All else was good."
4,Nice account of the Reagan presidency,"Nice, not great. This is 30,000 ft fly by of the Reagan presidency. I was a bit surprised by it's lack of depth in some story lines but you can't put everything into one book. I know there is a liberal basis to the book and that was ok with me since I see myself as an independent. I didn't want to read a pro or con book about Reagan, just some interesting facts. That's about all you'll get, basically press releases from all 8 years of the Reagan administration. One thing this book did for me is motivate me to read other books to get a different perspective. So, for that I am thankful."
1,Disappointing,"Having read Reeves's two excellent previous works on Kennedy and Nixon, I was looking forward to his Reagan book. Fortunately, I didn't purchase it and took it out from the library. This book offered little in the way of depth, detail, or worthy analysis. A good comparsion is the dropoff between Tom Clancy's early works and his oft lampooned Op Center! It was almost as if Reeves spent little time on research and traded in his cache as a respected presidential historian in order to make a quick buck. I expect to see this poor excuse for history in the 4.95 dollar pile at the Strand within a few months, and even then I won't buy it."
1,for some not others,"This book is written by a liberal -and in my opinion-for liberals. If you are a conservative and a fan of Reagan I don't recommend it. Instead, I'd site a work like 'Ronald Reagan' by Dinesh D'Souza."
2,Too Biased,"I couldn't finish it, it got to a point where I couldn't trust what the author was saying because there were many times when Reeves seemed to intentionally discredit Reagan and conservatism. It was bearable at first, but after a while became too much to handle.It's not necessarily just about my own bias. If I were to read about FDR, I wouldn't want a biased conservative, or at least I'd want the author to be fair and unbalanced in the book's writing.With that said I'd certainly read a Kennedy book by Reeves, which I know he's written."
3,Reeves' Reagan is incomplete but still intriguing,"I disagree with the reviewers who feel that this book is not worthwhile reading, as it does provide some fresh insight into Ronald Reagan's character and his style as president. That being said, one is still not entirely convinced, or satisfied, with Reeeve's portrayal of the president, particularly in its analysis (or, rather, its lack of) of his capacity as a leader of the American people. Perhaps the fault is not entirely with Reeves in this regard, as Reagan was quite a complex man; certainly far more complex than he is made out to be by his left-wing enemies, and more complex, too, than those on the right who see him as a towering, heroic figure. Overall, the book is worthwhile, but not definitive."
1,Way Off The Mark,"Reeves trots out every disgruntled employee (lots of Donald Regan) to paint a biased, one-sided, portrait of Ronald Reagan. He purposely minimizes accomplishments and reduces Reagan to a lucky, out-of touch, and corny ""old man.""President Reagan was, of course, not the saint that the Republicans seem/want to believe, but it's painfully obvious that the current super-heated turf wars between the major parties make any honest appraisal of the man impossible in the near term.The mean-spirited hatchet job that Richard Reeves delivers is shameful (and his contempt for the American electorate is staggering). At times it reads like Kitty Kelly. Too bad. I was looking forward to a comprehensive look at those years.I bought RR: The Triumph of Imagination at Costco for $19."
5,One of the very best biographies in recent years.,"This book appears to be a well researched biography of Regan's eight years as president. It is very well read by the reader. His impersonation of Regan's speech, voice, inflection is particularly well done. The author offers deep insight into the character of all players. Rich in historical facts."
2,"Very eccentric Fantastique, other selections fine","Leonard Bernstein made many fine recordings, but this is not one of them. The bells in the Witches' Sabbath are really ugly...almost dissonant and way too high in notes. Too bad they didn't use bells that more closely resembled funeral tolls. And the March to the Scaffold, my favorite part of the Symphonie, sounds terrible. The Ball is okay. Overall, the whole thing sounds like Bernstein set out to make this recording sound unique. I have not heard Bernstein's earlier attempt at the Fantastique, but they say that it was much better. Previn and the LSO do a good job with Harold in Italy and the Overtures."
5,Love it!,"I'm a big fan of Lisa's work and this book was outstanding. I love her simple, clean style. In addition to the great scrapbooking tips, you are treated to Lisa's beautiful photography throughout. Her travels make for such interesting pages! I think both the beginner and the advanced scrapper will find much inspiration in this book."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book from Michaels for $19.99, so it is definitely a deal here on amazon! But, let me warn you..there are some pretty layouts but there isn't a lot of explaination for techniques used. This may be for a more advanced scrapbooker who already knows how to do certain things but for me, I wanted some tutorials. I also found it to be quite annoying that the author repeated word for word some blurb about finding inspiration in her neighborhood. I felt like she was just trying to fill up space and insult the reader. The book could have used a lot more variety toward the last chapters when they brought in more elements to the pages. I don't consider patterned paper an extra element. It seemed like each layout was just patterned paper, stamps, and sticker letters. That's not very exciting at all."
2,Disappointed,"The title of this book drew me in. Scrapbook pages with limited supplies appeal to me because I like clean, simple pages. The guest scrapbookers create some beautiful, inspirational pages. The authors pages, however, fall short. Her photographs fail to capture meaningful moments in a creative and artistic way. Too many mediocre photos clutter the pages. There's nothing to draw me in and capture my interest.Actual design instruction is limited. Helpful little tips are scattered throughout the book, but that little bit is not enough to justify purchasing this book. Instead I stongly recommend Clean And Simple Designs for Scrapbooking: Ideas for Design, Photography, Journaling & Typography by Cathy Zielske and Scrapbooking Made Easy (Simple Scrapbooks)."
2,I agree with Debra...,"I am not a scrapper that likes the 'overdone' and 'overembellished' look, but this goes to another extreme and the authors pictures ARE generally nothing to get that exited about. Also, when I pay for a book, I like there to be more reading content - what really disappointed me that they supplies used (what little there were) were not specified. When I see items I like (patterned paper, stickers, etc.), I like to know what brand they are so I can seek them out myself..."
4,Awesome second CD!,"I bought their first CD while in Germany, touring with my parents, waaaayyyy back then. I loved their music then, though some people would think it was just too strange and disjointed.Well they have come out with this CD. This album is much more mature than the first, but it still captures a lot of CoS weirdness which I love. The addition of Peaches in my favorite track, ""We Don't Play Guitars"", is just perfect! The video included on the CD is great.Most of the songs I love, though some of them just go on for too long and it gets monotonous after awhile. But this album will certainly appeal to a broader spectrum of listeners, due to their matured sound, and a more rock feel to their music, rather than random songs, and lyrics that just fly all over the place (which I still loved immensely!)If you're looking for something TOTALLY different in the electronica scene, this is certainly worth checking out."
3,Disappointing,"No question about it - Chicks on Speed are a wild little group. But, oddly enough, this album seems to be their stab at mainstream success. Gone are the majority of their rough edges and in are vaguely Garbage-inflected pop tunes. A decent stab at popularity, but I expect more from this group. On 99 Cents they don't sound like they're on speed - more like Chicks on Light Refreshments."
4,Blade Runner: The Gimmick,"Having been a Blade Runner fan since it's theatrical release, I was more than happy to see the director's cut for DVD which was like seeing a new movie. One that made you use your brain. Although the gimmick is nice and you get all 5 versions including the work print, I was slightly disappointed at Mr. Scott's commentary. No real discussion about the movie and why he did this or that or why this was symbolic of this or that. Just a regurgitation of what was in the supplementary documentaries. I got more from Rutger's insight about the film or from the actors/writers than I did the director. Too bad he didn't take the time to really give us a sense on why he did what he did. Then the set would be really complete. But you do learn quite a lot from the supplementary material to keep this a definitive collectors set."
3,Director's cut is all wrong,"Blade Runner, as it was original shown, is a Maltese Falcon set in the future. The Director's Cut, however, is a sci-fi Hitchcock thriller. While the Director's Cut is still visually fascinating and taps into some of the same themes, the actuall movie Blade Runner is an infinitely fascinating take on the original black and white film-noir genre and how Sam Spade would fit inside a future world. If you've never seen either version, I would say get this DVD and watch it today, but I really wish that Ridley Scott would allow the original and much more intelligent thought provoking 1983 Blade Runner to come back."
1,Give Me The Studio Version,"Pass on this one. I want the narration and I love the happy ending. It is a classic, with the narration, and a bore without. Someone force Warners into releasing the original version.This is one case where the Studio was right."
1,Why buy it?,"I have seen the original movie, so ""cut-and-paste"" here the praises from others.It is just that I do not see why I should pay to get a partial work.Come on guys, our family members each spent an average of eight hours to view the bonus features of the Matrix, almost like watching four splendid movies. Go to a friend who has the Matrix DVD and request to ""follow the white rabbit"", you'll see what I mean.This is how DVDs must be: Give you so much more to see and enjoy.From what other reviewers say about this DC DVD, it should have more bonus features, plus multiple endings, plus... plus... You can forgive the directors for wanting to force their ideas in the original release, it is their prerogative, and they offered a good work there; but why ""force"" again here? Why not offer alternate versions, and /or alternated endings at least, not to speak of behind the scenes?Sorry, I will suffice with my old deteriorating VHS."
5,Fantastic,"I have this film on a few different VHS and DVDs. The Blu-Ray video quality is stunning. But most of all, the audio is a huge improvement over prior media. If you have a high quality home theater system, you will be very impressed with the audio!"
3,Disappointed,"I should have kept this movie on tape when i first taped it from Cinemax, I never thought that the director would screw it up by removing the narration form the movie. I wish I had it now, because it's hard to find the original version. I also prefer the happy ending to the new ending. I'm still looking hard for the original version, it should be a collector's item."
4,"Not all ""Director's Cuts"" are better...","Film editors play an important role. They help enhance the story by making edits in just the right places, and some are masters of their craft. This movie ""felt"" much more like a Sci-Fi Bogart Noir with Harrison Ford's P.I. style voiceover, which has been absent from the only available DVD version for nearly a decade now. Instead, we are served up some obtuse surrealistic mythological imagery, and drawn out silences at what is supposed to be the climax and denoument of the film.Save your money until the theatrical version of this Cinematic Masterpiece is finally re-released."
2,Director's Cut vs Original Release,"I have to agree with other reviews regarding the Director's Cut. I have both versions in VHS, and find the original version far superior. I expected that, like VHS, both versions would be available on DVD, but that hasn't happened yet. How do we let the studio know that what we really want is the original version on DVD? I love this movie, but don't really want to buy the Director's cut on DVD, since I consider it inferior. Thanks..."
3,an unclear cut,"The released version is easier to understand. The voice-overs add to the clarity, and reassure the viewer. Mr. Scott leaves too much to the viewer to ""get"", where it is just as likely he will ""miss"". His director's cut also seems to linger on the murky and maudlin, though it is clear he feels it is the romantic and poetic. I'm certainly glad they went over the movie with a steel comb before they released it. It never would have been my favorite science fiction movie if I had seen this director's cut first."
5,The Best Copy You Can Get Your Hands On!!,"There are many many many different copies of Blade Runner. My advice, get this one.Pros+Blu Ray+You Get all the different Blade Runner Films in this copy.+Awesome Picture Booklet/artwork from the film.+Tons TONS! of extras.Cons**really, none. Not one single con here**If you love the film, pick this up right now. It wouldnt look any better than on Blu Ray. I only paid 23 bucks for this awesome collection. Money well spent."
4,Wait for the better release.,"This is the same BR dvd that has been out since the inception of dvd, but with a cleaned up anamorphic transfer. It has no extras, and only 2.0 sound. Later in 2007, they are releasing a multi-disc set of BR with different cuts of the film and lots of extras, not unlike most of Ridley Scott's dvds. This is just a place holder. You've waited this long, you can wait a few more months for the ULTIMATE Blade Runner set."
5,A depressingly dark moody film that makes you think.,"I have both versions, the original release with Ford's voice over, and the ""Director's"" cut (which is surprisingly, shorter than the original). Of the two, I tend to prefer the original.Purists tend to find the voice over of the original distracting and un-necessary, but I find it adds to the mood.I love the cinematography.It also sports early or first appearances of many now well known actors.I would consider this movie to be within my top favorite movies."
3,An Improved Video Transfer... With Some Big Exceptions,"As another reviewer here on Amazon pointed out, the video quality on this release is an improvement over the previous one, with some notable exceptions. Most of the special effects shots contain HUGE amounts of video noise and/or graininess. I found this so distracting that I couldn't enjoy the wonderful visuals -- especially the awesome opening of the movie.I feel misled by the ""professional"" reviews of this release on DVD sites, which generally praise the transfer and don't mention the above problems. I wish I'd waited until next year's Final Cut, which I'm hoping will clean up the special effects shots."
3,Either you like or don't like,"I liked the movie as originally produced. For those that also do and are afraid to say it; IT'S OKAY TO DISAGREE! The money maker for this film will be a new release with both adaptations and in widescreen format with enhanced sound. Some say the new version more closely resembles the original Dick story. If, by saying that some of the names are the same creates a resemblance, then I suppose that is true. No mater what version you like, the movie is a classic and a great work for your Harrison Ford collection."
2,DVD Tech Review,"I resubmit this review as a service to DVD fans... Won't waste your time with movie analysis, just the DVD complaints:1. No extras, like commentary, outtakes, etc.2. No 5.1 sound3. No DTS4. Doesn't include both versions: with voice over and without.I keep reading a new version is due out. Consensus seems to be wait and see if Warner addresses any of these complaints before buying. That's what I'm doing."
5,"NO, no no noooooo.","I cannot belive the number of people saying the film is worse without the voice over and stupid moronic happy ending. I don't want to insult people here but if you can't work out what is going on without the voice over then you really aren't paying attention. The delicious ambiguity in the is he/isn't he a Rep still has me confused (even though Ridley Scott said he was). Ford's acting is superb, you can tell what he is thibking just by reading his face. Unless the theatrical release has all the extras that are criminally missing from this DVD DO NOT purchase it in preference to the ditrectors cut. Scott knew what he was doing, Harrison knew what he was doing when he deliberatly managled the voice overs, everyone knew what they were doing apart from the studio execs."
3,Good changes to a otherwise slow movie,"I saw Blade Runner when it first came out in the theaters and I was very disappointed. This Directors Cut of the film really makes up for a lot of mistakes made in the original. Getting rid of the narrative and changing the ending where two changes I thought made the DVD much better then the original movie. The few special effects that were in the film were spectacular, especially for the time it was made. I still thought the movie was slow, but the last 30 minutes of the film almost makes up for it. The DVD looks and sounds excellent and Blade Runner is a great DVD to own if you are a hard core sci-fi fan and don't mind a slower paced intellectual movie."
4,Is this Alien or Blade Runner?,"Blade Runner has never been prettier, and I find it kind of sad that very current films (such as 28 Weeks Later) look horrible next to this (don't buy 28 Weeks on Blu-Ray, stick with regular DVD; it looks the same and costs less). SKIP the director commentary-Scott likes to pat himself on the back about how great he is, and talks non-stop about Alien. About a third of the way through it drove me so crazy I had to switch the commentary to the second track, which consists of writers and is more entertaining and interesting (and they talk about this movie, NOT Alien). The added goodies in the package (origami unicorn, holographic plaque, hovercar) are a nice touch."
1,Director Cuts Blade Runner,"I saw someone asking for a copy of the original version. I do have two VHS Pre-Recorded copy of the original film but they are not in 2.35:1Ratio.Please do not misunderstand me here, I have no attention in selling them. I wanted to point out that I waited two years for the original version of Blade Runner to be release on DVD. After seeing Animal House being remove from the shelves I finaly bought this cut up version of Blade Runner on DVD. I watch both, VHS and the DVD together, so I can still enjoy the edit parts and see the rest in 2.35:1Ratio.If anyone can tell me how to get that Director Ridley Scott to release both versions on DVD please tell me."
2,Overated!,"I just don't see what all the hype is about. Granted the scenery looks cool, but you only get a few seconds glimpse at it. The story is under developed. This really had potential but ends up flopping. This could have been a wonderful sci fi epic. Instead it bored me to death. ... Harrison Ford is still the man though. But a [bad] ending, the lousiest end to a villan ever. Don't listen to reviews, this movie is terrible. Nothing in life is worse than wasted talent."
3,Misleading Content Description,"I have just now opened my Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition and looked first for my signed letter from Ridley Scott. There is no such thing contained herein. There is a mass-printed plastic sheet inside with a general description of the contents and a printed replication of Scott's autograph at the bottom.In short, THERE IS NO SIGNATURE FROM RIDLEY SCOTT."
1,The Worst Movie Ever Made,"I can't believe I didn't turn this movie off. I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing happened in the whole movie. It was a waste of my 2 hours and my $1 to rent it. The dvd is awful. Its got no special features, the menus are about as pretty as Christopher Lloyd in one flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. There was no plot to this movie, there was no action in this movie, there was no sex in this movie. So what's so good about it? I don't know. It was awful. Harrison Ford had about as much testosterone as the Olsen Twins. The evil man was an idiot and the naked woman was about as ugly as Whoopie Goldburg. Everybody on the internet rants and raves about this garbage so I figured I'd watch it. This is not a classic. I could have wrote this script in 5 minutes. I'm going to go watch Show Down in Little Tokyo now."
3,Blade Runner Ultimate Collector Edition,"The Blade Runner Ultimate Collector's Editiongives you what is advertised and nothing more.For the price, only collectors should buy this.The little origami figure of the unicorn includedin the package was actually a plastic model andnot real origami which was disappointing.I would have liked the BlueRay version to beincluded with this set but I had to buy thatversion seperately."
5,New DVD release.,"I've heard somewhere that Warner Brothers is planning a newer, more updated DVD release at some point, but when and what I don't know. There should be a nice new 5.1 mix, maybe even DTS, but I hope they won't change the aspect ratio (ex. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Then again, this is just a rumor, and nothing is confirmed.Oh, and those who don't understand the movie, you really have no brains do you. You poor S.O.B.'s, learn to read between the lines of artistic cinema and turn aside from crap like Bad Boys 2. Ridley Scott isn't quite the best director of all time, but he's damn close. This may be the best made cult classic of all time, but then again I may wrong."
2,why did you change the original?????,"The original work is in my top 10 movies of all time. BUT, the directors cut ruined the movie. They removed the inner monolog which help to explain ALOT of things in the movie. Plus the ending is bogus. It just ends and leaves you witb an uneasy constipated feeling. Lucky for me I have a vhs version of the movie to take of my Blade Runner withdrawls. If there is a God of movies out there, please release the original with the extra footage. Pllllleeeeeaaaaaasssssssseeeeeeeee."
1,ZzZzZzZzZz...,"Everyone says its so great! I must have been watching a different movie. When it comes to movies I am one of those people that generally likes everything for what it is, if nothing else. This would have to be the exception to the rule. Boring, slow, cheesey effects, almost no plot, and the ending was unfulfilling at best. I've only seen the directors cut so I guess I can't appreciate the 'improvement', but whats so good about a polished version of a fundementally bad movie? Its like taking a class in remedial reading and getting an A; sure its an A, but its not a very tough class."
1,FOOLED! WARNING!,"Buy the 5-Disc edition for 50% less. This product is ""limited"" on 103.000 editions! The rest inside are cheap plastic gadgets from China. The only one who laughs is Warner Bros. I am sure that you can fool yourself better. The film receives five stars but this is here not the topic."
2,Blade Runner the final cut,"Disappointed, not anything like ""I thought it be.Was recommended to me just purchased a blu-ray playerand was going to purchase this on blu-ray the reason this was purchase (dvd) version.Many thanks foropportunity for review Marty Dublin, Ireland."
1,Have not yet gotten the order......,"I am very disappointed with this retailer. I have not received my order yet, even though it is more than a week overdue. I emailed the retailer a few days ago, asking that the order be tracked, but have received no response. I think you should remove this retailer from your list."
1,so disappointed,"I couldn't wait to get this set as this is one of my favorite, favorite movies. It finally came and I put it into my DVD player and the player couldn't read any of the discs. I went out and bought an HD DVD player, bring it home and I still can't view the discs. I have an HD wide screen TV. All of my equipment is for HD. Even tried viewing it on a friend's HD DVD player and we couldn't view the movie. Maybe I just got a defective set, but had to return it. This makes me sad."
1,BUYER BEWARE! HD-DVD shipped in BLU-RAY case,I recently purchased the Blu-ray version of this 5-disk set and was shocked to open the case to find 3 of the 5 disks loose within the packaging. I inspected the disks and found no major flaws ... then proceeded to place the first disk which contains the feature movie into my PS3 .... nothing happened ... removed the disk to re-inspect it and noticed a strange looking logo on the front of the disk ... it was labeled HD-DVD! ... two of the remaining 4 disks had the blu-ray logo with the remaining two having the standard DVD logo ... obviously having one studio with multiple formats is just a tad too complicated for them ... guess they should have stuck with laserdisks ... a bit harder to confuse them with the beta version.
3,Remastered video- same old lousy sound.,"Yes, the video looks great compared to the last edition, but why are we still stuck with that lousy 2.0 sound? Skip this edition and wait for the rumored final release."
2,THE ORIGINAL IS A 4-STAR,"This ""director's cut"" illustrates why we have film editors. I very much like Harrison's voice over on the original and feel it helps the story experience for the viewer. The rest is only clips that was wisely left on the original cutting room floor. The only thing better about this video is the color quality. My copy has faded over the years and I now am searching for a DVD of the ORIGINAL cut."
1,Bad Cut!,"I purchased this title because I had seen Blade Runner and wanted to own it. I thought that the ""Directors Cut"" would be even better because it would include more NOT less. With this version you get more CUT and less movie. Take my advise... stay away from this Directors Cut."
4,Blade Runner,"Would have given 5 stars only there is no narration by Dekard, like the original. Commentary overlap is not the same as the original narration."
5,Classic,Maybe the greatest production design ever. (I'm always amazed at the dust and trash on top of M. Emmet Walsh's office - such attention to a history of detail!) Nothing was ever the same again. And this is a beautiful re-cut. Definitely worth it.
3,HELP!! I Want the Original...,"Call me what you will, but I much prefer the original to the Director's cut and will not buy the DVD of the Director's cut. I would very much like to have a DVD version in the wide screen format however. Let's be realistic here folks; neither version even vaguely resembles the book any-damn-ways, so why should anyone care which version anybody buys?! So, whaddya say..can we have the Original on DVD? (Which, by the by, I give 5 stars)"
4,Sharp image and nice sound. That's it.,"The print and sound on this DVD is the sharpest so far. Aside from that, there is not much new. I think I saw maybe two changes that were not in the Director's version. You also get three different commentaries. The second DVD is 'The Making of . . . "" which has additional footage that could have gone into the movie DVD, but didn't."
2,"Great Movie, but VERY POOR DVD Master","I love the movie ""Blade Runner"" and was looking forward to enjoying it in the extra fidelity of DVD. I was shocked as the opening credits jiggled and bled. It was as if someone were sitting in front of a high-speed dub of a VHS tape with a hand-held camera recording this.This is not the only DVD product I have viewed where the video quality was no better than VHS tape. The industry is really screwing up by releasing substandard quality recordings.I hear the Stanley Kubrick collection is an abomination. Why is the industry abusing the consumers like this!!!?"
4,Great Buy for a Classic on Blu-Ray,"You get 5 discs in this package. Three are Blu-ray, and two are DVDs. It's a great buy for the money, and of course, the Blu-ray discs show awesome picture and sound quality. One thing to note is that Disc 1 and Disc 5 may be identical due to a packaging mistake by Warner Bros. You can call them, and they will send you the disc you are missing. Just be sure to have them explain how to tell which disc is missing, so you get a replacement for the one you don't have (the ones you have are identical, so you need a way to tell which one is actually missing from your package)."
5,Buy THIS Version!!!,"This is such a No-Brainer!! For less than the price of 1 HD-DVD you get 5 discs; 4 different versions of one of the Best Sci-Fi movie of all time..in HD!! I dont even own a HD-Player yet but at this price, Im grabbin this Title!!"
5,Simply Amazing...,"The quality of this edition is stunning. All versions of the film with awesome picture and sound, a lot of interesting and beautiful collectible items and all these packaged in an amazing case. The final price for this kind of production is simply a fantastic bargain. The edition is region-free and plays wonderful on my european ps3. Highly Recommended!"
2,Screw the Director's Cut!,"Is this ALL we're going to get from now on? Deckard is a replicant, he dreams of pretty unicorns, and he doesn't feel like narrarating, fine. But I still have my original un-rated Embassy Home video unedited VHS version from 1986, which I regard as precious and sacred. And it's starting to seriously deteriorate.Where and when the hell is the original??..."
4,great!,product arrived on time and works great! The film is much more streamline and timeless. Masterpiece. A must have for any cinephile.
2,Motion Picture is great; the DVD was faulty,"I love the movie, let's get that right up front. The fact that the DVD pack came with the documentary was gravy, but definitely a plus. Now I realize that I was getting the DVD for a good price and that corners might be cut somewhere, however it was somewhat telling that when I first opened the plastic case housing the discs, the actual plastic DVD case tore as if it were paper! No big deal, it's just a case, right? So I was able to watch the movie and loved it. However, the second DVD (the one with the documentary) would not play. After examining it, it definitely appears to be faulty as the physical DVD appears cloudy. I tried the disc in multiple players without luck.While I am still happy to own the movie, I would be hesitant to order from the same supplier a second time not knowing where they source their movies."
5,P. K. Dick done right...,Blade Runner is the screen adaptation of Philip K. Dick 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' and although it differs slightly it remains true to his harrowing vision of our bleak future. It tackles some difficult moral and ethical questions that we will be forced to deal with soon. Nothing is for certain. END
2,Director's Cut - a disappointment,"It's a terrific movie! I've seen it a couple dozen times since its release in the early-eighties and this is one that I never grow tired of. The Director's Cut is exactly what the name implies ""A Cut"". Why the voice-overs were cut is beyond me. Decker's thoughts are what pulled the whole movie together. Without them, the movie is just not the same. Maybe the director decided to get Politically Correct - who knows."
4,A great sci-fi film!!!,"Bladerunner: The Directors Cut can lay claim to this. It is has the brilliant visuals which you'd normally expect from director Ridley Scott combined with an excellent soundtrack by Vangelis. Good script, acting and special effects.This 'Cut' of the film is more in the way of what the director intended it to be as opposed to what the executives/studios wanted. The narration and 'happy ending' that spoilt the original release have thankfully been removed. This makes for a more intelligent and thought provoking film.This DVD release is good. Picture quality is fine, but could be better. Audio - Dolby Digital 2.0 - does the job. It does lack the extras that you'd expect from many new releases these days, but with a film this good extras aren't that important."
3,The Search Continues.,"The Video Quality of this release is definatly and improvment over the VHS Copy. However I would have liked to have seen the alternate version of this movie, with Harrison Ford doing the voice naration and the different ending as well. This could have been included as a Bonus Feature. Your better off purchasing the Regular DVD, the extra cards and poster are not impressive at all.I guess any version of this Movie on DVD is better than nothing."
2,A feast for the eyes if you could only keep them open!,"If the story was as interesting as the cinemaphotograhy, this would be a 5 star movie. But unfortunately, the story is slow starting and never builds any momentum. I kept thinking this is going to get really exciting any minute now, but after an hour into it I realized I needed 3 espressos if I was going to stay awake. DVD is an excellent medium for this film. It really shows the detail that Ridley Scott put into it. It is an excellent film for your DVD collection, if you're wanting to show off your machine. Otherwise, this movie is a real snooze. END"
2,Director's Cut Should Have Been Cut,"I believe the original theatrical release was far better than the director's cut which was a bore and the Unicorn scene not only made no sense it did not fit into the film. The original film monologue kept the film moving and was a brilliant vehicle for telling the story. As for the ending of the original, the final words gave the audiance something to ponder vs. the Director's cut which left the audiance wondering, wondering what happened to the film ""Blade Runner""! The original theatrical release of ""Blade Runner"" is one of the best all time Sci-Fi's ever and remains so today."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"I had seen the TV version before and liked it. However, this one has a lot of graphic violence, nudity. Read the book. Good ending performance by Dolph Lundgren."
5,Epic Movie and Blue Ray collection,"I tried to order this epic movie and my most fave film here at Amazon but sadly shipping policies are relegated to the domestic market., but my luck changed here in my country and saw one store ( not going to mention name ) having a couple of stash hidden along with the single and 2-disc final cut special edition Blu Ray for only 20 dollars. WOW!!! I actually was tempted to buy the entire discs they had in store.. but no.I never tire seeing this film, it is so overwhelmingly beautiful. It's very relevant story ( even to this day ), the atmospheric lighting, Vangelis' haunting music, I so loved the gorgeous Sean Young in this film, Ruthger Hauer tears from the rain line, and Harrison Ford's epic and very ""human"" portrayal."
3,Blade Runner - The Final Cut,Pretty much disappointed in the final cut. I was expecting a little more at the ending. It is pretty much the same as the original movie disc except the voice over from Harrison Ford is missing. I rather prefer the original disc as I could care less about the interviews on the second disc.
1,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Tape was bad, probably broken, thats okay I will keep looking. Maybe see if I can find a DVD version with full screen. I am stuck with VHS tape that is using widescreen. Spiderman 3 is the same way, plan on selling it to someone who likes widescreen. Give me full screen any day."
3,Blade Runner-4 disc set,I expected more new stuff than what was added. The DVD did not live up to the hype.
5,Best DVD Box Set EVER,This is the NICEST box set for a single movie i have ever gotten. The case is nice and sturdy. the dvds are nicely tucked in there and the extras are spectacular. the only downside is the little police car is rather cheap. Its pretty lightweight and slightly flimsy. But that doesn't really matter unless youre going to play with it. So this is a 10 out of 10
3,Could be better ...,"I saw yesterday Blade Runner in Blu-ray. Of course the video quality is better than the DVD, but it just deserves 3 stars. Look at 2001, Push, Patton, Quantum of Solace, these are BD with great video quality !!!"
3,Blade Runner,"I was under the impression that this edition had the 'voice over' in the film. Upon further research, the version I am looking for is the 'Theater Version' not the FINAL CUT as this DVD was of FINAL CUT version. Still delivery was prompt and movie in excellent condition."
4,Blade Runner CD,"Gave it as a Christmas gift, so I cannot review the quality of product.Arrived in good time."
3,it was ok,I heard all this hype about Daryll Hannah in this movie.....It was ok. it'd be interesting to see a remake of this movie.
1,The Director's ...!,"This has got to be the ALL-TIME WORST DVD conversion EVER!Blade Runner was a great movie. They could've released it with both versions, w/voice over, and this ...! But no option! You're stuck with this ..., and YOU get to do the voice over for everyone who sees this for the first time!My wife, and several friends have never seen the original, and it took me 5 hours to get through this ... while I tried explaining why so-and-so did that! Or why is he staring off into space? Or what was that look for? Is ""Skin Job"" a new kind of plastic surgery?DON'T WASTE YOU'RE MONEY! RENT IT FIRST! You'll see what I mean!"
2,am i the only one who...,"Am I the only one who prefers the original version? Harrison Ford's voiceover added to the film's noir feel, and filled in a few background details that made the story more understandable. Perhaps creative folk are loath to admit that studio execs are sometimes right, even if it's for the wrong reasons. In addition, I LIKE happy endings, and so do most people, which is why moviemakers do them so much."
1,Check Your Discs!,"Search the Web for ""blade runner blu-ray disc return"" and you'll find many people who got mislabeled duplicate discs. Amazon.com will help you out if you check the discs soon enough and find an issue, but if you wait too long Warner Brothers doesn't help. I have called multiple numbers that lead to message recorders. Nobody responds.Check your discs right away; Amazon is your only return option! If you have a bad disc and have waited too long, WB doesn't care."
1,Horrible DVD - Video quality is like unto ancient rental VHS,"The movie is great the quality of this DVD is horrible. It appears to shimmy and shake as if someone were sitting in a theater with a camcorder. Very displeased with this purchase - should be sold in the $1 bin not as a $10 item. You would be better off with VHS or perhaps LaserDisc. Wait for the rumored forthcoming ""definitive"" DVD release by Ridley Scott the director."
3,Why Director's Cut Only?,"There's necessary information in the voice-over that's missing from the Director's Cut. Likewise the style and extra character development in the director's cut are better. What we need is either a completely new cut with better (more limited?) voice-over, or at least we need a DVD that allows you to play both.I think everyone agrees that this movie could have been great. What we have is just seriously interesting. Since I saw the original release, I can't objectively judge how well the director's cut stands on its own. I suspect that most of the people who say it's great have a similar problem that they aren't admitting to."
4,Early 80s Sci Fi was way ahead of its time,"I have one word:PUT THE GD FORD NARRATION BACK IN!!! I did not mind the new scenes, but I'm sorry Blade loses a star due to lost narration!Bring it back for Christ sakes!!Early sci fi fare of the 80s coming off the heels of SW and EMPIRE holds up well even for that time. Interesting to go back and view BLADE in this day and age. Matte painting and rotoscoping techniques still look impressive in the age of CG generated Yodas and Coruscant city-scapes. Joanna Cassidy sure looks hot. I wonder what she is doing now?"
3,Not as good as the theatrical release.,"This is the only movie that I can recall where the director's version is worse than the theatrical release. The loss of the narrative (which was the only way I understood the movie the first time I saw it) is not worth the brief unicorn dream scene that was added back. I remember an interview (I think it was with Johnny Carson) where Rutger Hauer mentioned the unicorn dream scene and was shocked to find out that it was cut from the theatrical release. When the director's cut came out, my dad and I saw it on VHS and were both terribly dissapointed. I wish I could get the other version on DVD."
1,The Director's Cut is AWFUL.,Compared to the original version the Director's Cut is awful. Background narration has been removed; the ending has been changed. Don't waste your money.
2,are you crazy,"The original theatrical release is far superior, no matter whether harrison ford did the narration bad on purpose or not. The narration is still one of the best things in the movie, the 1920's style detctive narration keeps the fils going and from putting you to sleep. I can do without the lame unicorn scene {which is probably a lame outtake from the cutting room floor of legend.} i dont care if harrison might be a replicant and the happy ending people complain about is more ambiguous than happy.to be honest whilst the directors cut is still a fairly good movie, it is very slow and boring. the theatrical cut is easily a 4 star movie if not higher. Hopefully one day tey will release a 2 disc set with both versions and some special features. This lame bare bones release is just lame."
4,Do Replicants Dream of Erroneous Unicorns?,"Saw the ""Final Cut"" in the theater yesterday, and all I can say is THANK GOD, THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE IS FINALLY AVAILABLE on DVD. Like others have expressed, there is simply no getting around the superiority of the original release over the many lame versions that followed. Not only does the narration aid in giving you Deckard's p.o.v. and evolving character development, but is essential in making (albeit, only some) sense of the story. The ""Final Cut"" adds very little other than a few seconds of beautiful visuals extending 4-5 scenes, but the expanded score (and I do LOVE the score) actually undercuts certain scenes where silence was much more effective. It's too bad we are forced to purchase the box just to get this one version, but at least we are getting it and the price is right."
2,The Original was way better!,"I just bought the Director's cut version on DVD and am extremely disappointed in it! The ending, which was one of my favorite scenes was eliminated, along with other pieces which changed the flavor for the worse."
3,Tech Stuff Only reveiw,"Won't waste your time with movie analysis, just the DVD complaints:1. No extras, like commentary, outtakes, etc.2. No 5.1 sound3. No DTS4. Doesn't include both versions: with voice over and without.I keep reading a new version is due out. Consensus seems to be wait and see if Warner addresses any of these complaints before buying. That's what I'm doing."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I GIVE THIS DVD A 1 STAR RATING NOT THE MOVIE. JUST TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THEIR IS A MULTI-DISC SPECIAL EDITION COMING OUT SOON. SEE BELOW.And finally, here's a bit of news that's going to get a lot of you excited (and I made a point to specifically ask about this title, believe me)... Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) is currently on track for release as a multi-disc special edition in time for its 25th anniversary in 2007. The release is far from certain (as usual, there's a lot more that I can't post about this title yet - think of the old saying, ""Loose lips sink ships""), but Warner says that work is proceeding, most of the key players are involved and things are ""looking good"" for release next year. We'll see. STAY TUNED TO DIGITALBITES.http://www.thedigitalbits.com"
3,Just not as good...,"This is the first occasion upon which I've seen a director's cut and wished it was the theatrical release. While Harrison Ford's voiceover may have been poorly executed and a bit cheesy, this version, which edits it out, seems slower, poorly paced, and was harder for people who hadn't been familiar with the movie to follow.I don't think there was enough background written into Bladerunner, and the lack of narration both obviates and aggrivates this flaw. This cut would have been much better if the additional dream material and the less ""happy ending"" resolution were added in, and the cheeseball narration remained in as well. Unfortunately, and somewhat shockingly, this director's cut is not an improvement over the original- it's not even as good."
3,Once Again Big Entertainment Management Overlooks Profit,Sales of the original uncut version would exceed sales of the director's cut.
5,Blade Runner (Five disc complete collector's edition) in Blu-ray.,"I have enjoyed this collector's edition very much. I like the fact that it contains all versions of the movie. After viewing all of the versions I have decided that I still like the original version best. I know that it may sound silly but I like the original narration. I think that some of the narration, especially at the end was quite good. Makes a person think about his/her own mortallity."
4,A good restoration of a classic,"This was exactly what I was expecting, which was a very well done restoration of an all-time classic movie. The video on this Blu-Ray release looks very very good, as you would expect. Nothing very new here, just a well executed restoration."
5,Amazing!,This is by far the best treatment this movie has ever seen! You can feel the attention it got!Now I hope I can sell it to get the Blu-Ray version!
2,Directors Cut Loses Something,"In comparison with the original theatrical release, this version of Blade Runner suffers considerably. While the removal of the voice over from Harrison Ford no doubt pleased Ridley Scott and the film critics, it lost a considerable amount of clarity. Attempts to make the film more artistically and aesthetically pleasing by the exclusion of the ""Sam Spade"" narrative results in the viewer wondering what is going on in a number scenes. Give me the original film any day."
4,"A great movie that lost its ""classic"" feel","When I first saw Blade Runner in the theater, I was blown away. Here, Ridley Scott had combined a Sci Fi Thriller, with a classic ""Humphry Bogart"" feel. I've heard many say they didn't care for narration...but could you imagine a ""Bogie like"" thriller without one? Harrison Ford has often been called the ""Humphry Bogart of the next generation"" and this film proved it. The visuals are still stunning, and the new ending is more thought provoking than the original, but without the Narration Overlay...its lost that special something that made it stand out from the rest of the Sci Fi thrillers that are out there. END"
2,Bummed,The copy I got skipped too much for me to be able to watch all of it. Im going to get a disc repairer and see what happens.
4,"One of my favorites, but bad shipping.","This movie is a bit hard to understand if you do not know any background or have not read the book. Those with the deductive skills to understand things without prior knowledge will be tested. Anyways, It is an incredible movie. I vision of the future from the zeitgeist of the 1980's. It is the last scifi movie to use only analog special effects (effects that arn't digital), and directed my the legend Ridley Scott. The movie has such an atmosphere and mood to it. It catches you right off the bat.My bluray case was broken in the corner when it arrived. I'm not sure who is to blame for that though."
4,Blade Runner DVD,"The directors cut of Blade Runner edited scenes I wanted, but thats not sellers fault. Good product, great price. Would do business with him again!"
4,Exactly what I thought,Description is dead on. Everyone knows how great the movie is.I am reviewing the package and presentation which are pretty good for a special edition. No complaints at all.
5,Better Than Ever,"I was amazed by Blade Runner when it was first released in theaters, but this new remastered version looks better than it ever did on the big screen! This is a ""must have"" for any science fiction collection."
5,movie nut,we bought this for our movie nut son and he loves it .. he is quite the collector but i do not have much more to say about it .. not my type of movie ..amazon was fantastic .. order came very promptly thank you
2,A less than stellar DVD,"First off the Director's Cut blatantly disregards most of the book especially at the end. But since I am inclined to base my rating on the DVD itself, I'll not count that against it. My big complaint with Bladerunner is that the movie was released with two versions and only one is present on the DVD. Thus, the viewer is forced to watch the Director's Cut. The DVD is also a little shy on extras. The movie itself isn't too bad, although its pace is a tad slower than many other good science fiction movies and may cause many viewers to become bored. I suggest holding off on purchasing this DVD as it is rumored to be scheduled for re-release around December of this year. Hopefully the new release will have both versions of the film and the additional extras such a famous film deserves"
4,DVD version needs more.,"I was a bit dissappointed in the DVD version, it was actually not much better than what I had on video, and there are not features to speak of.The movie is a classic. I would put it up with the _Maltese Falcon_, and _The Big Sleep_. In fact of all the Humphrey Bogart style movies that Harrison Ford has tried out, this is the only one he does as well as Mr Bogart might have done with similiar material.The director's cut is infinitely superior to the original movie. Gone are the cheesy voice overs and instead you are left wondering if perhaps Dekkard himself is not what he seems.Had the DVD contained more features I would have instantly given this a five, but the lack of effort in putting the DVD together drops it down a notch."
1,Manufacturing problem?,Like quite a few others I received this set with the primary 1st disc being in fact a duplicate of the 5th disc which is just a workcut of the film. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement. But that set has the same issue. Disc one has different and correct artwork so it appears the manufacturer had some issues when they printed these discs and there are a glut of them out there. I sent Amazon another e mail to see how to proceed and don't know how that will go since they apparently won't do a refund for this order and a third replacement seems likely to offer the same problems. But buyer beware if you are planning to pick this set up through Amazon right now. Not sure if other retailers are having the same issue also.
3,Too Much And Too Little,"It'd be nice if they'd release a version with EVERYTHING. ALL the extra footage and extended scenes, narration, and so forth. The only thing I really liked about this version was that they fixed Zhora's death chase scene.Disk two has a featurette, which is over 3 hours long. If you are a true fan of this movie, you will savor every second of it. But if you're not, you could be bored silly (I was). Because they go into serious detail. I also thought they would do a segment comparing all the different versions of this movie, but they didn't. In one segment, they showed the Millennium Falcon building they put in the cityscape, but no one mentioned it verbally, which seemed odd.It would also had been nice if they showed the deleted scenes seperately that they talked about in the featurette. But they didn't. They covered too much of the unimportant elements and too little of the important stuff."
5,Excellent Service,"I got this item less than 24 hours just in time for my Husbands birthday, & shipping was very reasonable!"
5,No self respecting Child of the 80's would be without this.,"There are a few standards out there, Gone with the wind, Mad Max, Godzilla movies, Titanic, you get the picture. If you don't have THIS picture, you're incomplete. now, where was that Matrix link...."
3,"Buy the game, spare the movie","I unfortunately haven't had the privelage of seeing the original version, but I did pick up the DVD Director's Cut, which i'd be embarrased to attach my name to. The movie drags out and the ""ruthless enemy"" seems to have a kind heart. The ending leaves you puzzled and instead of wanting more you are relieved that it's over. Despite that, the effects for the year of this picture are fantastic and the picture quality is dazzling. It's probably the most realistic possible outcome in a sci-fi film of Los Angeles that I have seen. All I can say is rent before you buy. I wish I did."
1,Blade Runner (and Other HD Online Rentals) - Not in Digital Surround Sound,"The picture quality was good, but the audio quality for HD online rentals is in stereo even though my surround sound receiver displays Dolby Digital. I thought it was just this particular movie, but the audio quality was the same for all of my HD rentals. At least Netflix offers surround sound with their HD rentals. Bottom line, you can save yourself one dollar and just spend $3.99 for the same movie in standard picture quality and sound. If you decide you like the movie, purchase it on blu-ray so you can get the better picture and sound. Come on Amazon, get it together, or you'll continue to lose market share to Netflix and Apple...."
3,This is no classic,"I'll start with the positive: the set design for this movie is still fascinating, years later. Some of the street level plaster work looks kind of unlikey, as do a couple of the painted panoramas. But it's still quite stunning to look at. That's really where the movie sticks with you.But otherwise, it's very weakly put together. The acting is fine, but the dialogue is paced and unnatural and cheesy. And the editing in this director's cut, like the original cut, is very sloppy in places -- for example there's a scene that's supposed to represent hours of interviews, which messes up the time passage device. There's an editing mistake like this every two or three minutes, with bad continuity, and it's really irritating. It's like reading someone's bad spelling & grammar, and weak story-telling, with extraordinary penmanship. And its relationship to Philip K. Dick is tepid. Rent this one ... you won't watch it more than once."
3,Bring Back The Origional,"I think there is large audience out there, waiting for the origional cut to be released on DVD. Now is the time to upgrade the soudtrack and release the version that won awards. I have seen both versions of this movie in the theater and although the origional is among my top three all time favorites, I don't want to own the directors' cut on DVD. Release the origional cut on DVD and it is my contention it will outsell the directors' cut."
4,A dark side of Harrison Ford is a must for any fan.,"I love the narrated version. I saw it in the movie theater and on video may times, and frankly I liked the voice of Ford telling his impressions of the other characters and the story line. But not having the narration leaves the viewer to draw his or her own conclusions, and the added footage makes the movie even better. This is a classic futuristic film without all the made-up monsters and gooey gore - it's raw and gritty either way. And of course, seeing Harrison Ford in an early role, before he became president of the United States or ``the good doctor'' is an exciting adventure. He's self-centered, mercenary and not such a nice guy after all. That's the best part of this film."
3,Classic Detective Shows,"In classic detective shows the detective would narrate as the show went on. This is seen in many of the early detective shows, and can be felt in novels. Watching the directors cut left long silences and almost put me to sleep, but the original version, with the detectives input from his perspective, was enjoyable and kept me watching. I would never buy the directors cut on DVD, but put the original one in print and I am there."
5,So You Say,"This is a surprisingly controversial dvd. To me, the excellence of the original movie is reason enough to love it. Even if the plot and characters don't arouse identification at first, retrospection shows that the movie holds its own weight and then some, and has a lot to say about some important issues. Visually, Scott is so good, that a crackle or bit of static here or there did not upset me at all. So what can I say-- this is a great movie that people should collect-- it does not need extras or different versions. It stands on its own."
5,Even better in Blu-ray,"I have owned this in VHS, DVD box set and now finally in Blu-ray. Always great. Each a step better. And you get to choose your own favorite version."
4,Very good film. But...,Dangerous Days is SD! Why is it not possibly have been recorded in hi-def?I wanted to be included on the Blu-ray photos of the booklet.
2,"Good Movie, Bad Edit","You know, I love Blade Runner. It's one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen period. It also had this film noir quality with the voice-over. It was dark, it was gritty, it was brutal. I loved it for the cinematic masterpiece it was.But the Director's Cut doesn't have the voice-over. For me, this kills a lot of the gritty crime-story drama that the movie originally had. I would love to get my hands on a DVD of the orignal cut of Blade Runner, because I like it a lot more."
2,I liked the studio version better.,"Yup, I liked the narration and the original ending. It helped the movie move along. This doesn't have it and I find myslef quite bored.Why weren't both versions put on the disc?"
2,Two Words: What the hell where they thinking?,"This film didn't need to be re-cut, much less butchered into a ""Directors Cut"". I'm reminded of the words of Don Corleone after Santino was killed, ""Look how they massacred my boy""."
3,Ford's narration,"I am a Blade Runner fan. I have an old vcr version. I have seen the 'Director's Cut' on the big screen. It is a huge disappointment. Harrison Ford's narration was added to the released version because the 'Director's Cut' was too unclear on what was going on. The great narration of the Blade Runner was added after looking at the Director's Cut. They knew, and rightly so that the movie would flop without the verbal support from Harrison Ford. His explainations make this a great film. I would really like to get a DVD of the original movie released version."
3,BEWARE! Copy Protection May Render Disc 1 USELESS,"I ordered this with great anticipation.Put in Disc 1, and it would not play.I have a standalone SONY DVD Recorder/Player.If your DVD player is the least bit finicky about what discs it plays, or if copy protection on a DVD prevents it from playing, then DO NOT BUY THIS.Disc 1 played fine in my Computer's DVD drive, and it played ok in an older DVD player I have.Once again, Digital Rights Management screws things up for the consumer, when all the consumer wants is to be able to buy a product that ACTUALLY WORKS!!!I give this package 2 thumbs up for the content overall, but Warner Bros. are guilty of selling an item that doesn't work as advertised.>:-("
5,excellent Blue Ray movie,This 5 disk set for $27 is a good deal. 3 blue ray disks and two DVD disks are in the box.
2,"Interesting, but a classic?","I fail to see how so many people enjoy this movie so much. Yes, the visuals are stunning (especially for early 80s fx) and the concept is interesting, but the plot is paper-thin and utterly predictable, there is no suspense to be found anywhere, and the Vangelis soundtrack is intrusive, inappropriate, and tacky. The wonderfully talented Harrison Ford gives as good a performance as the ""look exhausted, now look scared, now look exhausted again"" direction allows, but are we really supposed to believe that he'd fall for an utterly unattractive Sean Young? A lot of people here have mentioned that the original cut is superior to this version, and perhaps it is, but unless the plot is dramatically different and the score is not present, I won't be watching it."
2,The Greatest Movie Ever Made?,"As of this writing, according to votes awarded, ""The Most Helpful Review"" on Amazon.com for this movie is by a person - Steffan Piper - who claims this is the greatest movie ever made. I feel exactly the same way about Walt Disney's production of ""Pinocchio"" - in my opinion, ""Pinocchio"" is the greatest movie ever made; it's just that it may take a few centuries for the world to fully appreciate it, as with this classic, ""Blade Runner""."
3,I would give it 5 stars if it was the origional,This movie is so boering without the diaolgue. If you are thinking of buying the movie I would suggest you are all caught up in your sleep before you watch this movie. because the narriation in the original made this movie great.
3,.,"Interesting and stylish, but painfully overrated if you ask me. Other than some of the visuals, there's just nothing particularly engaging or memorable about it. Shrug. I had high expectations, but it's just not a very big deal."
3,LOVE THE NARRATION,"I BOUGHT THE 4 DISC SET BECAUSE IT WAS THE LEAST EXSPENSIVE WAY TO GET THE NARRATED VERSION ON DVD. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GOT THE DVD YEARS AGO(THE DIRECTORS CUT)AND IT WAS LEFT OUT. THE BEST VERSION IN MY OPINION IS THE ONE RELEASED FOR EUROPEAN THEATERS. IT'S JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL U.S. VERSION WITH ADDITIONAL FOOTAGE (LESS THAN 10 MINUTES) OF MOSTLY VIOLENCE. THE ""FINAL CUT"", I WATCHED IT LAST NIGHT, WAS A BIG LET DOWN. I WANT THE NARRATION, AND THE ""EXTRA"" STUFF WAS HARDLY NOTICABLE"".I ALSO LIKE THE ""HAPPY"" ENDING OF THE ORIGINAL."
4,A Dirty Future run by Businessmen and Politicians,"It is never enough for the powerful: in this film they manufacture people and then ""recall"" them like Chevy did the Vega... but we find that people aren't machines even when they are manufactured. The man who is called to track down the last of the androids falls in tough love with the last best of her breed!"
2,Why can't films be left alone?,"This (""final cut"" version) is just not the film I remember and enjoyed. What is most bothersome to me is the missing voice over. That added the human element to what otherwise ends up being a bland, dark film. Very disapointing."
1,Directors Cut is not worth watching anymore,"I should have come here first to see some of the reviews of the Directors Cut. I never would have bought my copy. Without the naration by ""Deckard"" it is completly useless AFAIC. The voice over gave insight into what was happening that is not revealed by just watching the movie. And now in the movie where Deckard used to be narating, it's just silence. What's the point. I only watched about 10 minutes of the Director's Cut version and then I shut it off.Blade Runner used to be one of my favorite movies. I would have put it as a 5 Star rating in the original version. I will never watch it as the Directors Cut. I hope to be able to find an original copy.I hope Ridley Scott doesn't ruin Alien or Aliens like he did Blade Runner."
2,Bad film with excellent comment,"It is amazing that so many people voted for this film, so overwhelming that I thought it must be given a try. If only judging from the cover design and the year it was taken, I would never buy it. It turned out to be so boring and dull after about 10 mins of starting.The director was successful in making a good start, but failed to make a good development and entangled in slow paced acting & dialogue in dark & disgusting environment and so on.To rent before buying is my advice."
3,"Good, but not really the original","The DC is a good film. However it was not the version which achieved cult status and I doubt whether it would have achieved it if this version had been released first.The DC is cold, sterile and one cannot help but compare it to the original which was more involving ( in part due to the voiceover ). I reckon that eveyone who has seen the DC has also seen the orginal and subconsciously plays the voice over in their head anyway....Only thing I agree with is that the ending is better...."
4,I liked the original version with the voice over.,Content - The original version with the voice over is much better. I would buy THAT version. Video Transfer is excellent. Sound is excellent.
3,"""if ain't broken,leave it the hell alone""","There was absouletly no reason to change any part of the original bladerunner,i happen to like the narration, it adds that old film noir touch, its not ""LUDICROUS"", it adds an extra level of depth and meaning, sure with the narration gone you can hear more of the background sounds and voices,without it, you miss a lot great lines, especially what is said on the roof top by 'deckard',as roy batty is dying. And to to these who think the original ending is uplifting, maybe you should check to see if you have a brain at all!. ""THE ENDING IS AMBIGUOUS"" ,as is there fate?. I will always love the (1982) version the best, it was perfect then, why wreck an excellent movie because the director , did not have the guts to stand up for the movie he wanted back in 1982.Now all you can get on dvd, is this bastardized copy, i can only hope that i can find the the original dvd someday. thanks for nothing ridley scott."
2,Why don't they do a Special Edition of this?????????,"Everyone else is doing it, why not Blade Runner!Where's the Special Platinum Collector's Extended Director's Editorial Criterion Collection Super Duper Edition of this CLASSIC film?Heck, even George Lucas has given in and started releasing the Star Wars movies (the new ones, of course) on DVD.This DVD is terrible. It was among the first releases on the new DVD format, and by contemporary standards, it's just awful. No remastered audio or video. No special features. The only thing that could make it worse would be if you had to flip the disc part-way through the film.For the love of all that is good and holy in this land, PLEASE give us a SPECIAL EDITION of Blade Runner!"
5,Excellent Release,I've been waiting a long time for the Harrison Ford voice-over release and I was not disappointed. Enjoyed it as much as the first time I saw and heard that version.
4,"Not my favorite version, but better than the theatrical version.","Visually, it was Scott-perfect but I missed a few of the removed narrative inserts; I always felt it gave it a bit of the old ""film noir"" Dashell Hammett feel, even though it was superfluous."
3,Blade Runner,"Great movie-introduced afew new stars to Hollywood-makes you think-""is this where we as a society are headed""?"
3,"Worth while DVD, needs improvment","While I find many Director's Cuts to be an improvment to the origional, adding extra footage and effects not possible at the time film was shot. Now, if they included the origional Blade Runner with the Director's Cut in a two disk set, with the same sound quality, this will allow fans to be more objective.In my opinion, while the sugary ending (a recycled scene from ""The Shinning"", I've heard) is not something I would miss too much, I found the film empty and silent without Deckard's noirish narration, which completes the classic draw of the film and is how it is best remembered."
4,"gorgeous music, moody tone poem","This is truly a great movie, but I second the motion of those who want to see the original released version available again. Harrison Ford's voice-over narration gave it an extra bit of dreamy introspection that was very beautiful. But I think that both endings - the original's happy escape that the DC's sudden ending at the elevator - suck."
5,This is the 2nd best film ever made,"A classic. Ridley Scott is one of the best directors around, and this version of Blade Runner proves it. The visuals are simply outstanding, better than alot of films that have been made in 2000."
3,Wait Until Next Year,"Warner Bros. has announced a new DVD release of the 1992 ""director's cut"" (which really isn't a director's cut in the true sense of the word) this fall.Next year, a new cut of the film, a true director's cut by Ridley Scott, will run in theaters. Later in 2007, a four-disc DVD edition with all four (!) versions of this film will be released. It will contain the original theatrical version, the internation theatrical version, the 1992 pseudo-director's cut and the 2007 ""Final Cut"".This is not a rumor. It's real."
1,The studio did it right the first time!,"Ridley Scott is more into visuals than dialog and plot. This much he has admitted in counless interviews.By removing the narration, he leaves the viewer with a lot of pretty pictures and not much else.Even worse, we don't even have the option of buying the original (and superior) version.Bad enough that this adaptation bears little to no resemblance the the Phillip K. Dick novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) it proports to be based on. At least the original was an entertaining film by it's own rights. Now it lacks any narrative flow or explanation. What a waste."
4,DVD review,The DVD is great. It did stop once and say it could not go on with the equipment i have. I reloaded it and wrnt to that chapter and it played through as thouhg nothing had happened. I haven't palyed all of the discs yet however.Chas
4,Ultimate Edition ?,"difficult not to be impressed when you see such a package, and what package that is. Everything you could wish for if you are a Blade Runner fan. I have compared the different ultimate edition on different media and while there is no doubt about the quality of the HD Version being amazing, i believe they could have included some more goodies (for maybe a more expensive price) if you wanted a really ultimate edition. I am thinking about small things like adding the 25th Anniversary Soundtrack or adding the goodies from the Collector Set (the dvd version that came out in 2000) and finally maybe a poster or something framed, but the hologram included is already very nice for that matter. Don't get me wrong i really like everything inside that briefcase, it's just that there is no cherry on the Anniversary cake :)."
5,Relevant despite the Age,"This is a profound movie; the visual world Syd Mead created is a mind-blowing abstraction of a capitalist-ruled society. Profits over people, and intelligent lifeforms as commodities for our whims. While not always sticking to the focus of the replicants as ""emerging humans"" --not unlike children learning the mores of social interaction-- Blade Runner soars for its examination of the question, ""Once we can create life on the human level, what seperates us from them? Why do we deserve to live, given that the replicants ultimately want to understand what it is to be human?"" This film posits serious questions and morals that are more relevant today than ever, now that we are at the dawn of the age of biotechnology."" This film caught my attention a decade ago (thx blade runner pc game!) and I am still enthralled with what this movie stands for. If you envision a future that's dirty, corrupt and as unpredictable as the present, this is YOUR movie."
2,Don't buy this DVD,"If you don't already own it, rent this DVD instead and wait (& pray) for the 3-Disc version to come out. This is a first-generation barebones DVD without any features. I bought it years ago, when the ""extras"" at the time included a menu and chapter selects, and maybe a few trailers.This movie is an ABSOLUTE must-see, but this DVD is a MUST-AVOID."
3,Not quite the Blade Runner I remember,"After purchasing and viewing the DVD director's cut release, all I can think is ""where can I find the original theater release version"". I sat my family down to watch it two nights ago and they lost interest very quickly. While it is still visually stunning to watch, it is not enough overcome the seeming lack of narrative/plot. In fact, one of the key things removed from the director's cut version is the voiceover narrative by Harrison Ford's character Deckard. For those that know the original version, it can even be a challenge to remember the significance of each scene. For new viewers of BR, they're left wondering, scene after scene, ""OK what just happened and what relevance does it have to anything?"". Bring back the voiceover!"
2,A true classic that deserves better...,"Bladerunner is still one of the finest cyberpunk movie ever made(Fifth Element don't even come close). When it was first aired, there were so may versions of the film. In my opinion, the European version is the best. It certainly has a lot more violence but it made the movie much clearer with Ford's narration and the happy ending that made the film less depressing than it already is. Sadly the DVD lacks all this offering us the director's vision only. Strangely the Criterion Edition LD(which offers the European version)has not made it to the DVD. This is sad considering that Ridley Scott's Legend is given a better treatment on DVD offering two versions of the film in a Collector's Edition(the fantastic director's cut and the horrible U.S version). Hopefully, Bladerunner will be rereleased with both European version and director's cut in the near future(and possibly a 'making of' documentary as well)."
3,"Hmmm, this is a toughie","Once again we see a studio put out a great movie on a really lousy DVD. The menu system is pathetic, there are no extras, not even a theatrical trailer, BUT it is anamorphic so not all is lost I guess. This is the director's cut version, and in truth I like the original cut with Deckard's narration better. Some say it's poorly narrated, but let's face it, Deckard isn't the most animated character in the world. The narration added that film noir element of a '50s detective story, but set in 2019, and I sorely miss it. The addition of the very short unicorn dream sequence seems to have no meaning other than tieing in the end a little and causing speculation that Deckard is in fact a replecant. I really like this movie a lot, prefer the original better, DVD is lousy. Film rating: 4 stars, DVD rating: 2 stars."
4,Blade Runner Directors Cut Blew It...,"I love this movie... however, in my humble opinion the directors cut blew it by eliminating Harrison's naration... which really sync'd this film and blended an old film dark feel with this futuristic dark genre. It would have been great to have had an option to turn it on or off... but to not include it... I can only say, I am very dissapointed... if I could only get my hands on a ""non"" director's cut I'd trade my copy in a micro-second."
3,Bring back the theatrical release of Blade Runner!,"Let me state that this is the greatest science fiction movie ever made in my opinion. I am old enough to have actually seen the movie in a theatre. It had a large impact on my life. While many people prefer the sparse style of the director's cut, I would really love to see theatrical edition included in any blade runner boxed set for balance. A lot of newcomers to Blade Runner only see the Directors Cut and many of them end up hating the movie. Including Harrison Ford's voiceover answers one burning question: Why the heck did Roy save Decker's life?The Decker/android/unicorn theory is so contrived that it is not worth adding it into the movie. If you have only seen the Director's cut, please don't judge it too harshly. Wait till you have seen the theatrical version. Good luck finding a copy though."
1,Problewm with disk one,"I too received the duplicated disk five on the disk one in the five disk blu-ray collector's edition. After I finally realized disk one and disk five were the same, and thanks to Robert D. Walstrom's comments from 21 January 2009 with the Warner phone number, I contacted Warner on 21 Jun 2010 for the correct disk one. Don't get to anxious for the replacement disk to arrive. I received mine on 16 July 2010. I gave the one star simply because of the messed up disk one which was the reason I bought the collection in the first place. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."
1,@@@@ WARNING @@@@@,BUYER BEWARE ! i ordered this 5 disc blu ray from usa. now i wished i hadn't. it started out being cheaper than ordering from my country canada. it arrived today and disc 5 had a huge crack all the way from the top layer to the bottom. the crack runs from the inner hole to the outside edge. also my first disc is the wrong workprint copy instead of the final cut. i wished i'd read these reviews first. shame on amazon for shipping known defective products !
2,"looks good, but you get very little besides the movie","The audio and video looks fine in this version, but I was disappointed that this ""final cut"" version does not have the Harrison Ford narration (which I like though many don't). The only ""extras"" are a few commentaries, and nothing else. If you just want a Blade Runner version w/o the voice-over on Blu Ray, this should work for you. Otherwise, I'd get a different version..."
2,"'Blade Runner' is Visually Impressive, But is Overall Boring","Harrison Ford is a very talented actor. I love mostly all his movie with few exceptions, this is one of them. I rented this movie thinking it would be thrilling, considering it was directed by Ridley Scott and starred Harrison Ford. Don't get me wrong, the movie is very visually impressive and is well-directed, but the plot is plain out weird and boring. I felt like I was falling asleep at some parts and then waking up fifteen minutes later not knowing what had happened. I never did fall asleep, it just felt like that. It is worth watching for special effects and direction, but the plot and story is really boring and confusing."
4,"Great movie, but a couple issues...",The booklet that comes with the 5-disc collectors edition claims that the narrative/voiceover is on the 5th disc (the workprint) whereas it (the voiceover) is only on the 1992 theatrical release.
5,Time To Die,"I initially saw this movie when it came out. I was transfixed. Visually LA had been transformed into a scifi future of new gas filled streets, flying cars, and the disturbing unknown. The future was here and I had been lucky, well sort of, to be immersed into the future. The movie had me almost hyperventilating. Over the years I have watched Blade Runner numerous times. Though all acted superbly, and the visuals and the special affects were superb it was Rutger Hauer's role as Roy Batty that made the film catch fire. There is plenty of symbolic characters to go around but it is clear that Hauer's character is the new Christ figure. Besides putting the nail in his hand and being called savior, he saves Deckart, (Harrison Fords) Judas character. The importance of the new philosophy is in Hauer's killing the creator. There is a mistake in the cosmos you die. Everyone dies."
3,Not the best version.,It's missing some dialog at the end that was in earlier cuts of this movie where it's explained that Decker & Rachael head north and a few other last details to tie things up.
2,Cliched and Timebound,"As impressive as this movie seemed in the early '80s, ""Blade Runner"" depends on too many trends from that era to take seriously now. The lighting and set design were meant to evoke '40s Film Noir but now remind me of an over-produced MTV video. The acting is of the less-will-seem-like-more-when-it-really-isn't school that Robert DeNiro inspired. And except for the schmaltzy ""Tannhauser Gate"" soliloquy, the only memorable line of dialogue is ""Give me more life ... f***er.""Worth a rental to take a trip down memory lane, but not worth your money."
2,Didn't need a redo,"Hey, you figure a director's cut, man it's going to be good. I mean the original version was one of the best sci-fi flicks I'd ever seen. This version was definately NOT needed. Too many nuances that there was just no way you are going to pick up were omitted when the voice overs were cut, that is unless you were a mind reader. The ending is so radically different, I was left wondering what Scott had in mind with this. My original version was on laserdisk and was stolen 2 years ago and since than, I haven't been able to replace it. Damn."
1,"Why waste the disk space for the so called ""Full"" version","When this was released it instantly became one of my favorite movies, a lot had to do with the voice over bringing back the feel of an old noir movie. The other was the bright ending after a dark night of terror. Since some like the director's cut and the theatrical release why not put both versions on one DVD? Real movie conasuers don't care about the falsely called ""Full"" version. Why waste the space on the DVD when both versions (in wide screen) would satisfy a wider consumer base? Won't buy this until the original is released."
2,Don't Bother Buting The DVD Version!,"While the movie is great, the DVD version looks as if they copied it from a 10 year old film print including ALL the scratches, scuffs, etc. it accumulated as it made it's way through the movie theaters. The sudio should be ASHAMED to have put out such a low-quality product! I gave it a 2-star rating ONLY because I like the story... as far as video quality, I've seen many better quality VHS home videos."
3,Blade Runner - The Directors Cut,"This was one of my favorite movies and I thought that the Directors Cut would indicate that it is improved in some way. Well the Director did not like the narration of the main star, Rick Deckard. I have a DVD copy and a VHS copy and the VHS copy has the narration. I prefer the narration but the tape version does not have the picture quality. I would very much like to find a ""normal"" copy on DVD."
1,Blade Runner Collector's Edition - Final Cut Disc Omission/Lable Error,"I received the 5-disc BR collector's edition set as a 2009 Christmas gift. Disc 1, labeled as ""The Final Cut"" was in fact, the Workprint disc - the Final Cut disc was entirely omitted from the set! Due to numerous reports on Amazon and in other forums, it makes me think that this error must affect thousands of units but only a few of the purchases are returned either due to consumer ignorance or laziness. This same manufacturing error has been reported since the release of the collector's edition and it is still not corrected - I suppose it is cheaper to replace a few discs for those who take the time to complain than to recall the faulty lot of sets with possible errors."
1,its DVD,I still cant understand why people have such a problem with the original version of this film -- I actually prefer watching it with the voice over. I am not saying the directors cut is bad -- quite the contrary -- its still an excellent film. However having both versions of this title would be a big plus. To the would-be buyer -- I would hold out until the studio releases the definitive Blade Runner pack -- including both the studios release and the directors cut - THEN decide which one you prefer.
1,Double workprint,"1* is rating this as an Item recieved not the quality or content of the Movie!This was bought as a gift for my husband who is a big fan of the film so should have been the perfect gift. The main issue was the double copy of the work print as many others have said in review but as we are UK resident replacing the disk is taking time though Warners in the UK say they are sorting this out for him. There where also issue with poor packing of the item resulting in a broken case but obviously thats an issue to be sorted out with Amazon. He has yet to see the final cut but has watched all the alternate versions and no doubt when he gets a copy of the final cut he will be on cloud 9, as so many say the blu ray Final cut is stunning. Till then he says he will ""dream of electric sheep"" and hopes no one finds him out !"
1,Blade Runner - Director's Cut,Stay away from this piece of garbage; try the original version if available.
2,whats goin on?,put the original version on dvd with harrison fords commentary. it's part of the movie. it's great. all you hear is dead silence on the directors cut. i guess we have no choice.
1,Absolute Crap - I'm PO'd,"I wish I had heard about the versions coming out in 2007 before spending a dime on this one. The picture is no better than before and the sound may actually be worse. I hope this film gets the velvet-glove treatment it deserves. It stands out as one of the greatest science fiction films ever - not a space opera like Star Wars or Trek, or cheesy alien monster-of-the-month gore-fest, but true, brilliant, thought provoking sci-fi. There are all too few films like this one. Treat it with the respect it deserves."
3,Get the VHS,Why on earth you would change a movi so much is hard to know but is sure NOT as good as the original...don't get it. what was the director thinking?????
1,"Loved the original, but hate this Director's Cut","The voice-over made the original movie comprehensible. It also imparted the film noir atmosphere of old black-and-white movies. Without Harrison Ford's voiceover, this movie is a mish mash of disconnected sequences. Nothing ties together. Get the original version on VHS if you can."
5,Blade Runner,I purchased this as a gift for my son who apparently has seen it & wanted it for his collection. It arrived promptly & in excellent condition. TX
3,5 Disc or 3/2 Disc,"Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [HD DVD]Well I thought I bought a 5 Disc Hd DvD set, But I actually bought a 3 Disc Hd DvD and a 2 Disc DvD. I feel a little Shafted here.Film is Great HD Content is great but its a farce to call this a 5 disc HD DvD boxset.A bit disapointed in AMAZON for not pointing this out in its description."
2,Rating for this cut,"I didn't have time to look through the several hundred reviews to see who else noticed the blatant mistakes in this cut of Bladerunner. So I apologize if this is a reiteration but I believe that this subject warrents a fresh review.Like I said there are editing mistakes in this film, at least two really horrible ones. Ridley Scott was quoted at saying he did a quick edit for this dvd release and has plans to do a better job for a more complete (one would presume special edition) release.I too bought this, drooling in anticipation of the director's cut of one of my most beloved films. While I do believe that the lack of narration improves the film (although this never really bothered me all that much, perhaps because my first several viewings were when I was a kid), the bad editing means you should wait for a better DVD release."
2,WHEN WILL WARNER BROS. GIVE THIS ITS DUE?,"Have you seen this? It looks HORRIBLE. I have nothing against windowboxing, but here it is rather severe. Not only that, but the image quality is VERY grainy.I've heard a new edition is finally forthcoming. If Warner Bros. has a brain among them they will issue this with BOTH original theatrical AND ""Director's"" cuts. Commentaries, isolated music scores are also musts."
5,Worth the upgrade.,"I have the director's cut on standard DVD, but after getting a blu-ray player I read that this format is a must have if you are a Blade Runner fan. It was well worth it! I was concerned that because of the age of the movie that it would not come across well on blu-ray, but the picture quality is fantastic. The sound quality is better as well. Also, since Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner is such a long documentery I thought I'd watch it in halves, but I could not turn it off...it was so fascinating!If you are a fan of this movie, the step up to the blu-ray version is well worth it!"
4,Just for the hell of it,"Not a bad thing, only buy if you are a collector of this sort of limited edition stuff that takes up lot`s of room for storage.Films are fantastic"
4,Where's the original Bladerunner?,"I've seen both versions and I prefer the original theater release. The Directors cut seems like a hoax, long periods of silence that seem shot for narration. I'd buy the Original theater release in a heartbeat (meanwhile I'll treasure my old and aging VHS of the original). This movie has been mired in egotistical controversy since it's original release. The original soundtrack was never released and Vangelis' recent soundtrack release was coifed to his preferences. Get the egos out of the way! Fans have always wanted the original flick and the original soundtrack...and have been left waving our dollars in the air for the taking. I was stunned the DVD version did not allow for the original cut.The egos must be stopped - Bladerunner is one of the five best Sci-fi flicks. How it ever lost a Best Original Costume Design oscar to Ghandi (ha) I'll never know.I own the current Directors-Cut DVD, both non-original ""soundtracks"" and the original on VHS."
2,This movie was good in it's time.,I watched this movie about a month ago. I thought it was really slow at getting to the plot and it drug out between the action. I think it could have been an excellent movie if it would have got my attention faster. It was worth seeing Harrison Ford in an early movie but that was basically it.
5,They should combine the two,"I have seen both the original and ""Directors Cut"" versions of Blade Runner. I like the ending in the Director's Cut better. I always thought the ending in the orignial didn't belong. And I also loved the ""unicorn dream sequence"" as well. However, unlike most of you... I was a fan of the narration. It made the film feel as if it was a detective story. Sure, some of it didn't need to be in the film... but the average moviegoer wouldn't get the films message without it. All in all, Blade Runner will always be one of my favorite films that I will ever see."
3,Memories of Green,If any film begs for the Special Edition rerelease on DVD (ala The Abyss)-- Bladerunner is it! A two-disc set with BOTH versions of the film and the Making Of Documentary. I gotta have that scene of Tyrell getting his head flattened and eyes punctured by Mr. Hauer. Ooooh yea! Have a better one!
1,Original Version Please!,"As others here have said, why just the director's cut? Where is the original with the voice over? I like them both, but prefer the voice over version. Why hasn't the original with voice over come out on DVD? Why not put both versions on this one? For that reason alone this DVD gets 1 star. Which is sad, because this is definitely a 4 or 5 star movie."
1,...,"I generally love Ridley Scott's work and the original theatrical release of Blade Runner is by far the more emotionally evocative of the two versions. My only hope of buying a DVD of this movie is if they bring out an Ultimate Edition that includes both versions... Until the Ultimate Edition is released, I'll hold on tight to my VHS copy of the original. There is hope that this may happen since Ridley Scott's Legend Ultimate Edition has been released. This disk includes both the original release and a director's cut. This would make sense for the studio since those people that bought the stripped-down sterile director's cut would also buy the new disk... You know, if I could watch and compare both versions, I might start to appreciate some of [the] critique. Who knows?"
3,Too quiet,"Not a well plotted movie, but so appealing visually - especially in the first 10 minutes - that it is hard not to like it.The Directors Cut was an improvement to the plot, with some very deft touches of character development and a more complex denouement. AND... stripping the voice over just makes the whole thing too quiet. Long silent stretches of actionless film that were carried by Ford's gorgeous voice now have me writhing in my seat with boredom."
5,"Great movie, visually fantastic with big package of goodies","No need to review the film. Yes, it's amazing.I was very impressed with just how much is in the five disc set. There is more in there than you could imagine. You get all the previous releases in HD as well! And, since it's HD, all three of those previous releases fit on one disk. Pretty cool.If only Emperor Lucas would come down from his ivory tower and give us the original Star Wars movies in an HD format.The visual quality of the HD version is unbelievable. I endured this movie on VHS. It looked like it was filmed in fog. It was obviously way ahead of the current technology. HD does this film proud.Now it looks as good as it really was all along.Kudos to Philip Dick for such a compelling story. Can you believe he wrote that in the late 60's? What a wonderfully insightful imagination?"
3,Director's Cut Sucks,"Blade runner has always been one of, if not my favorite SF films.I waited for the DVD and was disapointed with the ""directors cut"". I agree with other reviewers, that I would buy the original on DVD in a second."
2,Good effort but lacks in many ways,The original release with the voiceover at least made this movie interesting. Without it I am sad to say it is just a slow moving peice of eyecandy. The voiceover though hotly debated was one of the main ingredients that gave this film it's Noir feel.Also by trying to add to the additional idea that Deckard could be a replicant totally killed whatever effect had been built up throughout the movie.The short story was much better ....The DVD itself is subpar and has no extra's of note.
1,The directors cut STINKS!,"Sorry Ridley, but that is the fact. The words directors cut are 100% correct; the theatrical release was 122 minutes and the directors cut is 117 minutes. First of all is this verison 5.1? If so I don't see it. What a waste. This [expensive] verison is the same piece of junk dvd that I have left on the store racks for the past 2 years. No 5.1 & no theatrical = No sale. Plus the theatrical is Much better. The directors cut reaks! Hey ridley thanks but you can keep the stupid unicorn scene!Here is how much I loath this movie I consider Bladerunner to be one of the best Scifi every made I own over 400 dvds and I refuse to by anything but the theatical release."
2,Not Impressed,"Never having seen the movie (or at least remembering it), I bought the dvd because I hear of it being one of the great science fiction movies. The movie is slow without much plot and character development, and contains entirely too little action for a movie of it's theme. The music I think is terrible - I wished someone would've rescored the whole movie. The art direction is very good although some special effects are less than par (too often you see cars suspended from cables). The dvd is about as bare as you can get, containing basically no extras - even the ""jump to a scene"" option only gives about 9 ""jumping in"" places, about every 3-6 chapters. It should at least have the theatrical trailer which is standard on nearly all dvds. I find the fact that the dvd contained both the standard and widescreen versions to be a plus though. Even if you like the movie, you will find much lacking from the dvd."
3,Poor disc case,Amazing Blu ray edition. But the packaging is poor. The discs slide came loose in shipping and slid around inside the blue plastic tray and got scratched. It will be near impossible to watch every bit of all 5 discs to see if the scratches effects playback. Poor packaging Warner.
2,One of the most overrated films of all time.....,"At the risk of receiving hundreds of threatening e-mails, I will go on record stating that Ridley Scott's dystopian vision stands as one of the most unjustifiably praised films since the invention of sound. While technically marvelous and full of visual invention (it does use noir influences effectively), the story drags on endlessly and the characters, especially Ford's, remain aloof, uninteresting, and frustrating. As an exercise in style, it has undoubted appeal, but it must be heavily criticized at the screenplay level. When a story is in service to the visuals, it reflects a lack of confidence at the narrative level. I have never found Ford to be an appealing actor (he is far too bland to be a commanding leading man), but at no other time has his character been so devoid of passion or insight."
1,The most overrated movie in history?,"To the above statement I would have to say yes. If I were to go over every film made I'd be hard pressed to find one that's more overrated. Ok, the movie has cool special effects and music. I bought the soundtrack and can get the special effects jolt I need from Lord of the Rings or some other such vehicle. I have no idea why time and time again I see glowing reviews for this very unpleasant movie. There's nothing compelling or likable that I can find in either the characters of the dialogue. Which version would I recommend of the original or the director's? Neither."
1,The director doesn't make the cut,"You would think directors would stand behind their work to ensure that the movie original was uncut. Some of the finest parts at the end, including the epilogue, were removed. Beware!"
2,The Most Overhyped Sci-Fi Film Ever,"Okay, I'll admit it, Blade Runner wasn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't a classic either. In fact it was actually a flop at the box office when it came out. Given the special effects are marvelous, and the acting is pretty good, but as far as the story goes, this movie really doesn't have too much to offer. I mean, basically Harrison Ford just runs around and kills andriods that have escaped so they can be free? What the heck, it sounds like he's the bad guy to me, but yet the robots are supposed to be the villians. I just didn't think this movie was that great, so if you're looking for a real Sci-Fi flick, go get The Thing or Terminator 2."
2,So much for the electric sheep...,"Okay, on its own merits this is an okay film, but the fact that it completely bastardizes Philip K. Dick's wonderful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the novel upon which it was based, more or less totally ruined it for me. Virtually all of the rich layers of reality, religious allegory, and *many* significant plot points were completely absent from the film. One of the main characters, Jack Isidore, was entirely eliminated, and the shared messianic experiences and electronic animals were also gone. Also, Rick was married in the novel.If you're going to see this, you should definitely read the novel as well--it's a much richer experience.Neat-o special effects, though."
1,why is there so many types of DVD's? ARRRRGGGGG,"I had to return this set and order a different type. when I got it, I found that it was Blu-ray and I don't have that. I get frustrated with all the different types of the same DVD!"
2,Perfect Cure For Insomnia,First off I really love Sci-Fi movies and have tried to watch this 3 times now and have fallen asleep everytime. My god this movie was so boring it couldnt hold my interest. I loved Alien and the second one (Aliens) even more although I am well aware Ridley Scott did not direct that one. This movie is perfect in one respect and that sleep disorder clinics could definitely use it as a cure for insomnia. Now thats the perfect way to re- release a 20 year old movie for the umpeenth time.
1,Terrible movie,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ridley Scott in an overrated hack. Terrible score. Awful set design. Horrible script. Dull acting. Had the feel of a student film. I didn't like it at all. Just my opinion. Sorry if that offends some people. I purchased this movie based on Alien and the cult following it has. This is my opinion. Deal with it, nerds."
2,"Boycott the Director's Cut, wait for the Theatrical Cut","Someone who knew I loved Blade Runner gave me a sealed dvd of the Director's Cut. Guess what, its still in the package and will never be opened in my house. The original Theatrical Release is the one and only Blade Runner. You cannot imagine how Harrison Ford's narration adds depth to this movie. The Director's Cut is such a let down and I'm can't beleive Ripley Scott took it off the video versions. When will the Theatrical Cut be released?"
3,Loser w/o the voice over,Agree with the others that the voice over is critical to this movie. ONe of the basic appeals is the futuristic setting with the 1930's style approach. It is 5 stars with the VO and 3 stars without it
1,"What a mess--even with the ""do over""","Admittedly, I'm a fan of the book... The film, however, No. When they finally gave Ridley Scott the chance at a ""director's cut"" edition he should have done the world a favor and put it through a shredder. The sets and special effects: pretty enough. The acting: uninspired (as if under heavy sedation.) The screenplay: heinous! For the life of me, I can't see how anyone ever let Scott make another film, let alone have a second shot at this one."
2,my experience,"arrived timely, double sided vidio, one side (standard screen) locks up and skips, directors cut side plays clean. disk appears clean with few scratches, must be damaged in just the right place to cause issues."
4,Blade Runner,Harrieson Ford has done better Science fiction of course but still a good movie a a a a a a
2,Not so good ;~(,"Given that this was the final cut, I would hate to see previous cuts. I was hoping for deep sci-fi but it was basically a bad action movie."
2,A drearyt B-grade flick that doesn't deserve any shelfspace,"Blade Runner starts out slow and dreary, and ends with a depressing killing spree, knee-deep in moral (and storytelling) ambiguity. The film depicts a society where value of human life is very low. The technical gimmick of this film is the use of made-to-order disposable human laborers (with built in expiration dates). When there's a sensitive or dangerous job to be done--make a few slaves, give them the memories and training they need to do the job, and dump them in the recycle when the job is done. But what if they want more out of life... or just a few more years of it? This film is not exactly family viewing, and it's too nasty to keep in my collection."
1,a very dark film,"I've seen all the versions of this film and, for some reason, really want to like it. Unfortunately, most of the movie takes place in dark rooms, intended to symbolize, perhaps, a dark future but serves only to underscore the unreality of the film. Any real person going into any of the rooms in this film would open the drapes or turn on a light. It is like the technical director is about 14 years old.And it is slow, possibly so that we don't miss the product placement.I know this is supposed to be noirish, but noir films always clip right along. This drones along with a David Lynch obscurity (again, think 14 year old). I think if I were stoned as I watched it I might think it was deep. But, unfortunately, I wasn't, so I just wish they'd turn the lights on."
1,blade Runner Fainal Cut,"My mother wanted to give me something special for Christmas this year so I suggested this DVD as this is my favorite movie. I had to order for her because she is a dinosaur but that's okay, it's the thought that counts. Unfortunately she was not impressed as the DVD has several glitches and I could not get the movie to run correctly. As I had just watched Love Actually a few days before I knew it was not my DVD player so it was a big disappointment for both of us and she is still a believer in the old ways."
1,A Re-make would be good,"I totally agree with the person below me.I was sleeping at most scenes of the movie.This film its Freaking BORING!I don't know why so many people love this film.The film its way out of date. The special effects look awful.The whole atmosphere of the film sucks big time.Everybody looks 1980ish type. I HATED that time period!The only part I liked was when Blondy was killing the guywith the glasses nearly at the end of the movie.That was pretty cool.The worst thing is that this dvd doesnt have any supplemental material!No special features!Anyway, go see 'Fifth Element' or 'Equilibrium'"
2,this movie is boring,i really didn't like this miovie . i though its sort of boring. it didn't make sense.why is this movie considered so great. its not really good.
2,Disappointment,"I bought it since critics rated it as the best science fiction ever. It's hardly a science fiction, and the story is dull."
5,The Final Cut was well worth the wait!,"For this Ultimate Edition was well worth the wait. The transfer and addition to the film was flawless, and it brought me back to a younger time when I originally viewed the film in the theater back in '82. The work on this film was definitely a labor of love for the material and for anyone to say otherwise isn't just possible. The feel for this project was not lost over the years and with the new material, as it just enhanced this film overall. The dark tone, the question of Decker's own humanity, and the overall quest for life was not lost in this translation at all."
5,Ultimate Blade Runner,Like many SI-FI geeks I have been a fan of Blade Runner for many years. When I saw this five disc set on Blu-ray I had to have it. It did not disappoint! This is a quality movie made even better with Blu-ray.As always purchasing it from Amazon was easy and enjoyable.I would highly recommend this five disc collector's edition. It is a great add to your movie collection.
1,new dvd,Warner Bros.! Please release Bladerunner in 5.1 Dolby and 2.0 Dolby surround. what's the point of making a DVD if it's not going to have the quality of a DVD? That's the whole reason in buying them.
1,"Don't Like Directors Cut, Like the First Theater Release.","I don't know why people like the directors cut but having seen the first release in theaters with Harrison Fords Narration on it, to me makes more of a classic. Also, I have seen the Director's Cut and to me the ending seems boring when Harrison Ford doesn't expond on why he gets saved by the replicant. With out some of the other narration the movie seems vague on some points. I have been looking for the theater released version for awhile now. Can any one at this website help me find out if they might release the other version on vhs."
3,Bring Back The Original,"I don't care what Ridley Scottsez,I like the original version better! I like thenaration by Harrison Ford.Itgives the movie the feel ofthe old time detective movies.Both versions should be put ona disc! Until then this willhave to do,I quess. If youhave an L.D. player,you mightbe able to find a copy of theoriginal. The Criterion Edition is the best.It couldcome to DVD eventually."
4,"Good movie, Poor DVD Quality","Once again, Warner Studios' mass production of a great movie on DVD is poor in quality. Two different copies of this movie both display audio/vidio sync problems halfway through the movie. I have experienced this on other Warner Studio releases but NOT with any other DVD source. I won't buy the product if it is released by Warner Studios... very disappointing!"
1,* warning *,"I'm sorry this is one of my favourite movies of all time, but I bought the DVD and it is absolutely one of the worse transfers I have ever seen. The image actually wobbles back and forth like it was shot from a hand held camera. I would suggest waiting until Warner does a proper DVD release of this title. (FYI, I bought it from HMV a very reputable firm)"
3,"Interesting and gorgeous film, quality of the stream is poor.","Blade Runner is a ground-breaking sci-fi noire thriller by director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Prometheus). The film features stunning visuals depicting a futuristic city-scape, along with moody synth music, which creates a great atmosphere. Good performances all around from the cast though the script can be dry at times and the plot slow. I watched this film as a stream on this site and the quality was a pixelated mess, I've seen clearer VHS tapes, hence the lower score. If you're interested in seeing this movie I recommend it in an HD format."
1,"Original better, much better","No Extras, absolutely zero extras.Transfer from Film, one of the worst ever.After watching the original and the Directors cut 2 times each,I like the original better. It reveals more about the time, the place and mostly about Fords character. And that voice, HarrisonFord has a fantastic voice over voice. It's like deleting the flame on the Statute of Liberty. If they ever issue a improved version, put both versions on the DVD and for heavens sake clean the picture up."
2,Serious production quality issues,"I'm on my 4th attempt to get a playable copy of this product. The first three times I received my order, the main wide-screen, original theatrical version of the film had scratched areas on the surface that made the disc unplayable. I didn't even bother to check the rest of the disks. The abrasions have to be occurring either in the manufacturing or packing process, because all of the disks in the set arrive properly seated in their case. Buyer beware!"
5,The hollywood difference,"The director's cut is far, far better. Listening to Deckard's amazingly borish narration ruins the mystique entirely. The happy ending inserted in the original is typical of how hollywood butchers something perfectly grand because it doesn't wrap up everything in a tidy cliched package. One of the best features of the film is the startling ending."
2,Production Problem: First Disc is a 2nd Copy of the Workprint,"I am one of the unlucky shoppers who got a ""misprint"". Disc one which should be the final cut is in fact a 2nd copy of disc 5, the ""workprint"". Based on some reviews of the final cut maybe I'm not missing much, but it's annoying to have to exchange this. I knew there was a problem when I put in disc one and it looked lousy in hi-def. There is a separate disc with the US and international release versions along with the director's cut, which are all much better quality."
1,"""Director Cut"" is horrible","99% of the time when I buy a ""Directors Cut"", the movie is improved and usually the added footage makes it more enjoyable if you are a big fan of the movie anyway. This is a completely different movie. It's funny; the one thing in the original movie that has been copied in countless movies is the narrative ""feel"", and this has been removed in the directors cut. I am going to try to sell this because I will never watch it again."
1,This set STILL contains the wrong blu-ray disc,"I purchased this Blu-Ray set on 10 December 2009 and this set still contains the wrong disc. Instead of the correct disc 1: ""the final cut"" it contains a duplicate copy of disc 5: ""the workprint"" instead. Keep in mind this disc 1 is still labeled ""the final cut"" despite its contents. I would have assumed that after all this time Warner Brothers would have fixed it, but they haven't. Amazon needs to get with it as well and at the very least include a note and the number to call with every shipment of this set.Fortunately, the ""most helpful"" one-star review here at Amazon contained the 800 number for the Warner Brothers hotline to replace the disc (1-800-553-6937), and after 2 minutes and 31 seconds on the phone, Warner Brothers is going to ship me a replacement (correct) ""final cut"" in about 2 weeks. Hopefully they'll get the type of disc right as well."
3,"Movie's great, but why no 5 disc version in SD?","The movie itself is 5 starts, but what Warner's doing now is not cool, hence the three stars. If you want the ""working"" cut, you either have to go to the ""ultimate"" collection and pay $30 more, or buy one of the HD releases, which offer the five disc collection in a non ""ultimate"" edition for just $3 more than the four disc version.Looks like they're starting to push HD by offering extra features in teh HD releases. This may be a repeat of earlier campaigns where the studios try to push people to go out and buy many of the same movies they already have again, only in the new format."
3,Great Movie - Mediocre DVD,"Bladerunner has always been a favorite on VHS - so when the DVD came out - you would think the quality would be better. Wrong. At best, the transfer is average and almost identical to VHS. And there are no special feature sets. Looks like an early manufacturing run for the DVD - Wait for the special edition - assuming one comes out....Warner would be fools not to."
3,Great IF,"... if it's your first final cut Blu-ray collection, if not don't waste money on the tiny booklet and toy car. From the pictures of the product I was imagining the packaging as oversized and the book being much larger, it's not... it's the same dimensions of the Blu-ray case etc. It's tiny and so is the little spinner toy car, the lenticular collectible is nice. Overall it's a decent set of merchandise if you don't already own the previous Blu-ray release. I already own the other basic set so this turns out to be a waste. I honestly thought the art book would be more substantial than it turned out to be. If I hadn't opened it in a blind rush to check it all out, i'd probably return it."
2,"Bad DVD, Great Movie","You know, with all the information a DVD can hold, you think that Warner Brothers would have put some more into it besides: ""Interactive Menus"" .... ooooo! Can't get enough of those... It would be nice if, say, the original voiceover on the non-director's cut was available on a seperate audio channel, or if the non-director's cut was on the other side of the DVD. The movie is, of course, a masterpiece that looks beautiful in the DVD format. If that's all you want, the DVD is perfect. However, if you're a Blade Runner fan or simply love the extras on DVDs, you'll feel like I do; that there is so much more that could have been added to this DVD: like deleted scenes or a ""making of"" feature or even a couple of original movie trailers... but no, just some ""interactive menus""... disappointing..."
5,The Best Value,"I've waited a long time for this set. I'm lucky enough that the first time I saw Blade Runner was in Leicester Square 1982 and saw the International Version. I too prefer the narration, and was peeved to hear Harrison Ford say that he tried to muff the delivery so they wouldn't use it. The '92 Directors cut was awful - Unicorn? Anyway, glad to know the International cut is in this set. I'm a huge BR fan but don't need to pay an extra thirty bucks for the work print disc and a shiny case."
2,Another Disappointing Transfer,"This DVD is a terrible video transfer. I hope some time in the future this great movie gets the attention it really deserves - A DVD set with BOTH versions of the movie, some good extras, directors commentary, and a decent transfer. This is a very poor presentation for an extraordinary movie."
5,A classic!,"A classic in every sense of the word. Will be remembered as one of the best science fiction films, along with 2001 and Star Wars; and as one of the best of the decade, along with Raging Bull and Blue Velvet. This version is amazing: wide screen edition and that unicorn sequence leads to one of the most ambiguously shocking endings in film (move over Sixth Sense!). I first saw this film in my High School drama class and have been a huge PK Dick and Blade Runner fan ever since."
5,Incredible but the Original is Better!,"The only movie I was required to see during my Greek Mythology class at Harvard. The professor thought so highly of this film that a whole class was tested on how Roy Batty was the classic Greek tragic hero. A wonderful story of what it means to be alive. I love this movie more than I can say, it is a masterpiece, the only movie I have ever owned in every format."
5,A romantic futuristic movie.,"This is the most romantic science finction movie I have ever seen. The film ends with a basic principle, If I can think I exist... now if someone agrees or disagrees with this view is not the point here. If someone sees for the first time this movie must grab the romantic part of this movie out of the special effes. A great movie, and a must in someones collection!"
5,The director's cut of Blade Runner is a masterpiece.,"The spectacular imagery of the original version was what grabbed my attention the first time I saw this film. With the narration removed and the ending revised this has become a true classic. The DVD version is highly recommended. The images (new DVD player, older TV) were flawless from beginning to end. Too often spectacular sets overwhelm the story, but this is a sci-fi movie with heart."
4,"Don't be fooled, original is best","Ridley is a great director, but Bud Yorkin (who produced the film and defends the now-missing voice-over) was integral to the greatness of this film, which depends HUGELY on the voice-over. Don't be fooled! This film is better, much better, in the original version. The scenes which are supposed to leave one wondering whether Deckard is also a replicant are lame and stupid - they add zero to the narrative and are precisely as Yorkin loabeled them: a cheat. Not only a cheat, but one which adds nothing to the story.On the other hand, the best line of the ENTIRE film is in the voice-over, where Deckard sums up why (for heaven's sake why?) would the murderous killer spare Deckard in the end? It is stupid and untethered without it. Those who forgive this vital piece's absence are surely remembering the original, and so know the answer. For the love of heaven bring back the original in Blu-ray!) and shun this lousy second effort."
2,"Great movie, lousy transfer","I definitely like the Director's Cut better than the released version; however, the transfer quality on this DVD is really inexcuseable. The image wobbles throughout the film, the clarity and sharpness are really not up to par, and there's no 5.1 audio. Apparently, a new ""Collector's Edition"" is in the works; I'd wait for that to come out before buying this movie."
5,Ridley unleashes the replicants !,"At last this movie comes out as it deserves. The picture and sound seem brand new. The 5.1 mix is so amazing. To enjoy it at its best, I took the phone off, then I staid put in my couch. I just have to say thank you mister Scott."
5,Breathing new life into a classic film,"The picture on the HD-DVD is just breathtaking. The audio is fantastic as well. This movie doesn't look like something that was filmed 25 years ago. If it wasn't for the fact that Harrison Ford looks so much younger, you would think that this was a newer movie.Obviously, it is a great film with dark sci-fi themes that was way ahead of its time. But seeing how mind-blowing the special effects look in HD just makes this a totally new film.I can't recommend this movie highly enough. In fact if you don't have one of the HD formats (I have both) you should upgrade simply to enjoy this film as it should be enjoyed."
5,A Movie Beyond Definition,"I have watched Blade Runner more times than any other movie I own. If I could take only one movie with me, if we were evacuated for a hurricane, it would be Blade Runner. Every time that I watch it, new images are created and new character dimensions appear as if I were viewing the movie for the first time. Whether you like the version with the voice-over, which is my absolute favorite, or another version with a different ending, this movie presents dimensions of life and our possible future that are too strong to ignore."
5,Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition),"The cleaned up print made the rich blacks blacker and more foreboding. Truly a cinematic feat for the time. Still it is really unpeered in my opine. The extras are great too. The documentary Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner is an approximately three and a half hour long documentary and included interviews with Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Jerry Perenchio, Bud Yorkin and Ridley Scott, and also contains several alternate and deleted shots within the context of the documentary itself. This is a must for any Blade Runner fan."
2,I don't understand the hype.,With all the hype this movie is supposed to be like the best movie ever. It's just okay but with such high expectations I'm not impressed.It gets an extra star because it has a very beautiful woman and a good soundtrack.
1,Run a Blade through Ridley Scott for making this crap,"Harrison Ford becomes a screen legend off of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and then he does this futuristic toilet of a movie. The story didn't make any sense and it was just a bad movie, you shouldn't combine film noir with sc-fi, no Maltese Falcon with the Jetsons, or it just didn't work with this movie. Ridley Scott directs great films like Gladiator and Alien,then directs this wasteland of a flick that shouldn't be apart of the future with or without flying cars. any one who think this is better than Star Wars than get the hell off Amazon. Hollywood Homocide might treat you to better Harrison Ford films. If you want good futuristic movies rent Minority Report or I, Robot. Make a better future by getting rid of ""BAD RUNNER"" Harrison, don't think less of you because this crap you did."
4,Classic sci-fi,"Classic movie looks great on blu ray. Would not be what it is without Harrison Ford. Excellent movie, would recommend it"
4,"Clear, But","Yes, this was the clearest and sharpest Blade Runner I have seen. For that reason I think it is worth having in your collection. But my set only came with one DVD and the only feature it had was an Introduction that explained how they made it a cleaner copy. The other times I had seen Blade Runner it was always very dark. Perhaps this was the way it was intended to make the viewer sense how dark they thought the future would be. This one seemed to cut off some of the ending. Because it seemed to me when Harrison Ford left with Rachel they were leaving the city for the country and he was talking about how she had a normal life span v.s. the four years. But maybe I read this somewhere. I did feel disappointed when they got in the elevator and that was it. Worth the money, if you can get it cheap."
1,Not so good copy,I am not going to waste my time by reviewing this movie since this is AMAZON NOT IMDB!! DUHHH... The image quality is ok but can be grainy in some scenes but it is FAR from being Blu Ray.THIS HOW YOU REVIEW A MOVIE ON AMAZON!!! Now others know the most important fact which is image quality!!
2,I AM SO DISSAPOINTED,"I had such high hopes for this release. I had never seen Bladerunner and when the HD release came out I knew it was time to experience one of the so called ""best movies of all time"". I dont know what is going on with most of these reviewers... This movie is simply not good. It's dark, confusing every step of the way and nothing is resolved at the end. A purchase i wish i could take back. Obviously I am in the minority here, but IMO... Pass on this one."
1,This movie sucks!,"I read that this was the greatest sci-fi movie ever made. I love sci-fi but this movie sucked! People say it has ""intensely packed action"". It almost put me to sleep. The themes could have made a good movie but this is a disjointed mess. It takes place where the sun doesn't shine, literally, and it rains all the time. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer do OK with the script they're given. The writing and directing are the problem. It's VERY SLOW! Wanna buy my copy? Total Recall and iRobot draw the good points from this movie. Get those instead!"
1,Disappointed!,"The director's cut doesn't even compare to the theatrical version; it lacks everything that made this move great! Wait for the original version to be released and save your money. If I could give you my Directors cut, I would. It's going in the trash when the theatrical version is released."
2,Cut too much,"I have seen the original a couple of times and thought the final cut would improve on the original....wrong.To me the most important scene was when Harrison Fords tries to come to terms with the last moment and death of the replicant Roy. Also , cutting the last scene with Rachel in a ""greener"" world was a disappointment . It was at least a 4 star in the original. Will not watch this ""Final Cut"" again."
2,Ridley Scott's Changes Ruined a Great Movie,"This has always been one of my favorite old sci-fi movies. But in the ""Final Cut"" version Ridley Scott removed almost all of Harrison Ford's narration. This totally killed the retro film-noir vibe that the original movie had, which was one of my favorite things about it. As someone who's seen this movie many times, I can say that that the most memorable lines in the film for me, were in the narration.So if you're a fan of the original Blade Runner, I wouldn't recommend renting this version; you'll be disappointed."
4,Not as Good as the Original,"I watched this with my 14-year-old son last night. He fell asleep. This version of the film removes the voice of Harrison Ford and adds a bunch of deleted scenes (mostly shots of scenery). Blade Runner is a great film, but all the changes make this version seems slow and annoying."
2,Lucky me....,"Obviously, the movie's great. Classic, and with five discs of material at this price, how can you go wrong? However, my problem's not with the quality of the movie, the blue ray encoding, etc., but instead the delivered product. After waiting a week due to backorder, I found a beat-up, dirty, puffy envelope in my mailbox. Upon opening, I pulled out the movie I'd been eagerly anticipating. Blue plastic chips spilled everywhere, the case shattered at every corner. Packed in a puny bubble wrap envelope. Amazon, you can do better than this. What happened to all the comfortable, safe, brown boxes you used to send even the smallest products in???"
4,"Bluray vid/audio is perfect, movie is meh","The detail in the shots is incredible. I would have trouble telling how old this movie is.I bought this bluray without having watched it before, though, and I only feel ""meh"". I think it assumes too much prior knowledge about the world. If I had known that this was after a nuclear war and that most people had already fled Earth, it would make a bit more sense why this world sucks (I had trouble suspending disbelief with the fact that LA will be in constant rain in 8 years...). The final 30 minutes of this movie are too slow. We see Harrison Ford dangling from a rooftop for what feels like an eternity.I usually prefer lighter-fare movies and leave the serious stuff to TV shows, which have time to develop everything (ie, The Wire)."
2,"disturbing, boring, and depressing","I'm a Harrison Ford fan, and was dissapointed in and depressed by this film. The plot, doalog, and action were glacial. The ceaseless rain, 2019 LA smog, gloom, hyper-stimulation, and overcrowding were depressing; and I didnt care much whether Ford found the ""Replicants"" or not. The Hollywood formula guaranteed he would, with suitable travail. The film's special visual effects were well done for the time, and added to my depression. I wondered if the directors / produceers meant this to be a visual morality play about our current overpopulation / media overstimulation / and ecological shifts in California. If so, it didnt make much impression on our society.I wound up skipping ahead on the downloaded CD to see what happened. I will not watch this film again or buy the CD. Ugh."
2,Moves slow,"I turned it off half-way through, waiting for it to get better. Just seemed strange with nothing to hold my interest."
2,5Disc - Not,This 5 disc package could have been a 2 disc package. The making of Blade Runner and the HD movie. The other discs don't add much to the value.
2,Doubtful,Blade Runner didn't do much justice for me. There's something missing or wrong with the theatrical and the 1991 DC versions. I will give this movie another chance when it comes out next year. I hope Mr. Scott will give its proper cut.
3,"Blade Runner Was Okay. (Everyone should save the principal location, though: Ennis House).","Perhaps I am ignorant of the sci-fi world, but I fail to see how one could state that this is the all-time best ""sci-fi"" film of all time, especially when, approximately 10 years after Blade Runner was made, there was a far more compelling movie made, ""Back to the Future,"" which has generated a much larger fan base as well.The book, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,"" was far better than Blade Runner. It's hard to imagine that Phillip Dick would have approved of such a poor rendition of his masterpiece.One thing bears noting, though: one of the key film locations in this movie, Ennis House, is one of the most endangered properties in the world. It literally is facing the risk of extinction, and I do hope that the fans of Blade Runner, along with the cast and crew, will do something to save it."
2,still searching,is it possible to buy the original theatrical version of blade runner on dvd without buying the 5 disc set????
1,Didn't work in my DVD player or PS3,"My dad bought this and I tried several different things to get this to work (put HD cord in dvd player, played on PS3/comp./dvd player) and nothing worked. Don't know if it's something with my equipment or it's the DVDs but I never could figure it out."
2,Blade Runner Final Cut,"I have not seen this movie in a while but I am not very happy with The final cut. When I originally saw the movie theatrical version I loved the special effects and the characters, I can't explain it but the characters in this movie, were not very dimensional. I believe the movie is missing some special effects the original one had.Don't waste your time on this version get the theatrical."
2,Horrid Remake,"If Dir. Scott had wanted the movie made this way he would have made it this way, no this is a farce created by the Corporation to cut back on violence and make more money off a VERY GOOD movie, Dir. Scott had nothing to do with the ""Director's Cut"". Just a rumor, there is supposedly a 3.5 hour version with voice over. The REAL Directors cut I assume."
3,"2 years later, same disc problem","Just wanted to FYI people to a few things -First the Disc 1/Disc 5 Final Cut/Workprint problem is NOT exclusive to Amazon.com.Second it wasnt a 'small' batch. It was a large batch.Third almost 2 years later, this problem is STILL happening.I just bought this set from Target for $29.99. Disc 1 labeled ""Final Cut"" is actually the Workprint Disc 5. I called Warner and a new BRD will arrive in 1-2 weeks, no charge and I dont have to return anything.ONLY THE MOST HARDCORE FANS should endevour this task. You're 50/50 on getting the correct discs in the set. And with gas being ~$4 a gallon, can you afford driving back and forth 1-4x? If you are a completist like I am, you want ALL the cuts, so you have to invest 1-2 weeks getting the Final Cut (it's worth it BTW) or you can just buy the 2-disc Final Cut Blu-Ray if you just want the final version (and best version).I gave this 3 stars since the movie and quality is great. But 2 years later, the quality control is STILL crap."
3,Blade Runner,"I saw the Director's Cut and the Final Cut, I see almost little difference then again while the Cinematography is very beautiful and the special effects,it's Corporatist story(Perhaps Anti-Corporatist?-read between the lines) and how your suppose to feel sorry for such man-made creatures as if they were Human too,It's not to say it's not quite an experience watching the film even more than once as to try to understand more,I am just not a Major fan of it."
5,Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray],Great . . . . This is an Excelent Product . . . 100% Recommended . . . . .
5,Amazing Classic Movie,"I needed to see this movie for a film class I am attending. I literally can't believe I have never seen this movie. Blade Runner is an amazing movie. Remember it was released in 1982 so the view of the future is different but that's part of the beauty in the story. The last 15 minutes will change your life. Maybe not literally but possibly yes. Watch this movie, it's worth your time."
1,Polishing a turd.,"I was excited to see that the were coming out with a Limited Edition Collector's set of this film. I was excited because this is one of my favorite films and I thought this version would be loaded with extras. Well, it isn't. Not even a single commentary. Not a ""Making of.."". Nothing. You don't even get a choice of what version you want to see, the director's cut or the original. All you get is a poster and some pictures of the film! They want us to pay almost seventy dollars for that! Forget it. I'll wait for the Extra Special Super Collector's Edition Set (If it ever comes out.) This just proves Warner Bros. is responsible for some of the worst DVD transfers ever."
3,4 for a sound rating !??,I just wanted to say that whoever gave this movie a score of four in the sound category (see above) needs to get with the program. This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time and all it's given is a lousy Dolby 2.0 track instead of a nice Dolby 5.1. The picture quality is excellent but they need to release a new disc with an updated audio track in either 5.1 or DTS.
2,"Great movie, crappy DVD","3 things bothered me. 1. Bad sound. This is a movie, like ""Star Wars"" in which the soundtrack plays a huge role, and my normally booming DVD player suddenly sounded like an AM radio. 2. The whole film seemed very jumpy. You'll notice this in the opening credits, which are fuzzy and occasionally bump up and down. Is this a film that needs to be restored? If so, somebody please do it. 3. Extra features - where were they? For all its faults, ""Blade Runner"" is a work of art, and deserves DVD extras at least as impressive as those of ""Fight Club"", perhaps even the full ""Brazil"" treatment. Where are the storyboards, the making-of, the director's commentary? My dream is that Criterion or somebody gets their hands on this beautiful film and gives it the DVD it deserves."
1,"Original, Director's Cut, or Final Cut?","Rated only 1 star because you (Amazon) must make it crystal clear what the user is getting here, as there are now three versions - the original, the director's cut, and the most recent director's final cut!!!"
4,Four-and-a-half,"After reading this short review, please read on. The other reviewers will tell you some info that might be useful to you.My review is short for two reasons: 1) Blade Runner is one great movie, despite the fact that this Director's Edition might not be your cup of tea. After all, the original - uncut - version is better because of (amongst other reasons or opinions) the consistency in the storyline. Nevertheless, this version is one for the people that have a weak spot for some movie titles and want a complete collection. 2) The great image quality, no doubt about that. It blasts any earlier version away and that makes it worth the price.I would have rated this new DVD version five stars if the same could be said of the sound quality, but unfortunately, it only has 2 channel sound.And yes, I will buy the other versions that will come up, too. Hopefully these will play on all speakers ... ;-)"
3,Does Ridley Scott Dream of Electric Sheep?,"I can finally die a happy man if one day, the original theatrical release is accompanied by the 'Director's Cut' in some sort of over priced 30th anniversary edition being sold for far too much money.Although I do concede that a director is the final arbiter of the art he creates, I do also wonder about the responsibility a film maker has to the legions of fans who develop a certain attachment to the version of the film that touched them.Take for example Star Wars. I can't wait to buy the next, best, latest, greatest tweak of the hopefully last generation debuting on the latest software that will proceed the DVD of the now deceased George Lucas made to honor George by his beloved daughter.Enough director's cutting already. I just want my original theatrical release."
1,The Director's big mistake or how to ruin a great film.,"The director didn't know what he was doing when it came to editing this film, the producers did a much better job. My problem is that I loved the original and hate with a passion this version. Why don't they release the orginal movie so I can throw my directors cut in the trash. I would give this DVD a zero star if I could. The soul of the movie is gone. I'm a believer that androids with this level of ability have as much right to live as humans. The fact that we think they are our slaves and property with no rights is outragous. Equal rights for machines are coming in the near future and a man-machine war for equal rights is ahead (see Terminator I/II). The union of harision ford and the replicant in the ending of the movie is soooo significant. The beginning of the next phase of man-vs-machine."
4,Awesome bundle - weak box,"All the versions look beautiful in HD. Everything the Blade Runner fan could ever want is included here, and the price is great considering how much material you get. The only downside is that the box is very flimsy - on of the hinges on the disc ""flaps"" had snapped on mine. Shame - I would rather have spent a couple more bucks and have a more substantial box to keep this classic safe and secure."
3,please give us the studio's cut,"Why certain critics are so quick to jump on the ""director's cut"" bandwagon I will never understand. Some of film's best directors (woody allen, e.g.) would not be nearly so acclaimed without great editors. PLEASE GIVE US THE STUDIO CUT (preferably both cuts on one disc - this is what dvd is for)!"
2,I want the ORIGINAL.,"I thought something was missing. Now I found what they were. Without the voice-overs and the final scene in the original release, this movie is totally flat. Period."
2,"Compared to the original motion picture, this was horrible","The first ""Blade Runner"" was so good, especially with the story being told by Harrison Ford. The director's cut did not include this and much of the story is missed. Also, there was a scene with a unicorn...quite bizarre. If you get the original motion picture in stock, let me know as soon as possible because this one (the Director's Cut) was a waste of money."
2,The Orginal Was Better !,"Not much to say except that both my husband and I enjoyed the original Blade Runner much, much more. Actually, ordered it from Amazon at Christmas not realizing it was a different cut from the original shown in theaters (so many years ago!) Some script was changed and there was very little voice-over or ad-libbing by Harrison which for us made the original movie more interesting. Anyway, I had always said that this was one of my top-ten movies, but certainly not the Director's Cut. How can I get the original???"
3,The Director's Cut isn't as good as the theatrical version.,"I loved the original Blade Runner. It's one of my favorite movies of all time, but the Director's Cut cuts out vital elements that contributed to me enjoying it so very much when I saw it in theatrical release. When Amazon gets their hands on the original version of Blade Runner as a DVD, I will buy it and use the Director's Cut as the drink coaster it deserves to be. But until the real thing comes along, this unfortunately, will have to do."
4,nothing extra on the dvd,ok the dvd package is no extra value but still a wonderful movie. question why do replicants ahave trouble answering questions concerning animals or their mothers ? let me know !!
5,If you haven't seen it I envy you,If you haven't seen it I envy you because everything will be new to you and you will feel the feelings and reactions that the director and actors intended you to feel. My only regret about watching it so many times is that now when I watch Blade Runner I can't feel the feelings that I had the first time I saw it. I remember my anxiety during the chase in the building and the awe of Roy's last words.
4,Film Noir,"Blade Runner was definitely a film before its time when it was released into theaters in 1982. Most folks wanted the glitzy special effects that films like the Star Wars trilogy had in abundance. They cared little for any amount of substance that caused you to think beyond the box of popcorn in front of you. Then came Blade Runner....Theatrically, it was a flop. The box office take was low. However, people weren't just ready for it yet. It proved a ""thinking"" person's film and to this day has become a standard of its genre. My only complaint is the unavailability of the original narrated version. I enjoy the directors cut but there DEFINITELY needs to be a box set with both the directors cut AND the original version. Despite the darker (and more potent) ending of the director's cut, the film noir style of Harrison Ford's narrative gave this film a totally unique feel for a science fiction movie. It is sorely missed!"
3,A great film that's begging for the royal treatment ...,"This may very well be one of the greatest science-fiction film ever to grace the screen. It's themes, story, set design, cinematography, and characters have left an indelible mark that can be seen in so many of today's movies.Having said that, why on earth isn't this DVD just spilling over with extras? Where's the 2-disc multi-version set? Where are the three or four ""making of"" featurettes? Where are the interviews with Ford or the production crew?Considering the wide influence Blade Runner continues to have, I feel like it deserves more polish then it's getting. Warner Brothers really fumbled by overlooking this landmark ..."
3,A Five Star Movie with a One Star DVD,"When, oh when, will they release a REAL Blade Runner DVD? This classic deserves a heck of a package with it's legendary status and enduring popularity. Yet we sit around with an inferior version. Hey, you folks at the studios KNOW there is a market for this film - why not give us (and believe me, there are many of us) what we want? I promise you will get the dollars that you crave. Just give us a decent release and soon? You did it with LEGEND and heaven knows that film deserves nothing more than the crumbs of Blade Runner."
2,Please save your money,"Reviews of cult classics are tricky enough to begin with (never slam publicly on a cult favorite) but with the various manifestations of Blade Runner we have double the fun. That said...I like both the original and the directors cut. The directors cut demands more of the non-sci-fi initiated and puts many off. Rent the movie first if you are unsure and decide then. Now the real reason I write: this ""special edition"" DVD release is a terrible dissapointment. The ""special extras"" are not worth the money and when you compare the availabe features to any Criterion release...it is just sad and pathetic. This movie deserved more attention to detail - at the very least to help some viewers with the vague complexity of the story. Buy a tape for now and save your money for another release."
3,"5 star movie, 3 stars for 'Directors Cut'","Since the first time that I saw it, I have found the 'Directors Cut' of this movie to be boring, tedious and barely worth the 3 stars that I am giving it.The only reason I care about this movie at all is because I grew up with the original theatrical release, and it had a profund effect on me.This movie is more than just sci-fi, the original voice over provides volumes of insight into the Deckard character. It sucks you into his world and leaves you breathless with the rooftop climax. As a young man, I was inspired by the poetry of Rutger Hauers death scene.To remove the narration is unbelievable to me. Especially that last moment on the rooftop, C'mon - That gave me chills!!I absolutely cannot wait for the theatrical release of this movie to DVD, I have been waiting for 7 years!"
5,Blade Runner Comments,"This is an excellent compilation of all the efforts to date to make this film complete. The interviews and commentaries are very well done. Personally, I still like the original release because of the Harrison Ford voiceovers - it think this really adds an important dimension to the story. For me, the ideal film still does NOT exist - that would be the Final Cut PLUS the addition of the Harrison Ford voiceovers. THAT would be a very complete package that I would be happy with."
4,Blade Runner (5-disc Blu-ray),"You either love this movie or hate it. Very few people have ever said they just liked it. I loved it and the complete set on Blu-ray just made it all that much more enjoyable. Having the 5 different versions and all of the behind the scene work is really great. This movie had so many innovations and set so many standards that are still followed to this day. If you loved the movie, you will not be disappointed with this one."
3,Heartbroken!,"For the record, the movie itself I would give 5 stars but I am saddened by the ""Directors Cut"". I so hope that the original will eventually be released so that true fans can own the masterpiece in its entirety. I am just glad I happened to rent the director's cut before purchase because I was terribly disappointed in all that was missing. I'll just have to wait patiently for it to be released as it was when I first watched it."
5,Outstanding,"It's sort of a shame that the reviews for the five disk BluRay release of Blade Runner are mixed in with the reviews of previous releases. The Final Cut is breathtaking in both audio and video quality. All of the well known 20th century video ""glitches"" have been cleaned up with 21st centuty technology. But, if you still like the previous Director's Cut, or the original theatrical version, you have all that too. And the price can't be beat.Sure, the story line of the movie could have been a little cleaner and tighter - even some of the people closely involved in the making of the movie admit that, but, while the movie is running, it's hard to take your eyes away from the screen. Just think, not even the people who saw the original theatrical screening of this movie were treated to such clarity - such visual and audio depth.My recommendation - make some popcorn, fire up the big scren, dim the lights, and curl up with someone you love. Movie watching doesn't get much better than this."
5,Bladerunner special edition is awesome.,"This is impossible to find in Brick&Mortar's anymore, was a breeze to find and order on Amazon, and got it quickly. Also, this is probably one of the best DVD special editions I've picked up in a long time."
2,Missing Dolby True-HD sound track,"I am in the process of replacing all my HD-DVD's to Blu-Ray in order to reduce my equipment rack to a single Blu-Ray player. I received my copy of the Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) in Blu-Ray. The packaging indicates Dolby TrueHD is the primary sound track for the ""Final Cut"" disc of the movie. However, there are only 2 sound tracks on the disc--Dolby Digital 5.1 and a stereo sound track for director commentary...no others; not even foreign language tracks.The HD-DVD version of the ""Final Cut"" disc DOES include the Dolby TrueHD. This appears to be an engineering oversight on the Blu-Ray version. This is not acceptable. The manufacturer MUST be aware of this. As a result I cannot recommend that anyone waste [...] bucks on this collection. I give the video 5 stars but the audio doesn't even warrant half a star so I'm giving it the average--2 stars."
2,Two Stars For TDC,"I give only two stars for the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, but five stars for the original version--one of two of my all-time favorates (Wizard of Oz is the other). Harrison Ford's voice over add greatly to the atmosphere of the movie. Supposedly, Ford was not at all happy about doing the voice over and shows in his tone, or lack of, which actually ends up as the perfect narration of a down and out retired Blade Runner. Kudos for the theatrical version!"
3,Buyer beware - possible video problems,"This is only one man's opinion of the quality of the DVD itself. Be prepared for various video anomalies such as sudden and random brightness, changes and fuzziness of images and text. A big disappointment. In some ways better than VHS - in others worse. A new and improved version of this DVD needs to be released for such a wonderful movie. I was thinking it was my DVD player, but do a search on Google and you'll see many people have noticed strange things related to the quality of this product.Barely any extras at all (almost none). What a shame."
4,"The actual movie gets 5 stars, but not the DVD...","The movie gets a perfect score of 5 stars, and I can't really choose between the directors cut version and the theatrical version. The DC version allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions regarding Dekard and whether he is a replicant or not, and allows you to develop your own insights into the characters. The Theatrical version on the other hand pretty much holds your hand through the whole movie, which I personally don't mind, yet isn't really necessary, I like a movie which forces you to think about what is going on...and the DC version does just that.This DVD version falls short of 5 stars simply because they didn't digitally remaster the sound and picture quality. Blade Runner is the perfect movie for 5.1 surround sound, hopefully they will release another version..."
3,Just saw the theatrical release again...,"After a long search, I found a copy of the theatrical version again. Actually this was the international theatrical release, but it's close enough to what I saw originally in the theater (if it has something different in there I'm not sure what). I have to say: The theatrical release was SO MUCH better in my opinion than the Director's Cut. The narration added a world of depth to the character which was just lost without it. Also, the beautiful daylight scene at the end is haunting. The whole mood of the movie is different. I'd give the theatrical release 5 stars without any hesitation whatsoever. I'd give the Director's Cut 3 at best and maybe not even that. The director is not always right!!!I hope the theatrical version will be widely available soon. There's a whole new generation who will miss much of the depth of this wonderful movie."
5,A piece of movie history.,"It's hard to explain to the non-enthusiast just what makes Blade Runner the classic it undoubtedly is - the surprisingly solid special effects, the moody, dystopian setting, the enduring themes of life and death all add up to a devastatingly powerful film. This DVD is short on features, but the joy of seeing an undeniablely wonderful film in perfect quality surely overrides that. If you want to understand modern science fiction, you need to see this film."
5,Very imaginative,"This is one of the few movies that I rented, then bought immediatly. You just have to watch it several times. The visuals are stunning for the time, and the overall picture of the movie conveys is amazing. As for the comments that have been made about the directors cut, I prefer it to the original. Just taking out the voice over opens up the movie to a more 'spacey' feel. The last thing I want to have to do when I see a movie is have half the plot shoved right in my face, I would rather figure things out myself. The dvd could have been much much better. The picture quality is decent, but very lacking. No special features. I'm hoping for a re-release sometime in the near future. But I'm not complaining, its still far better than the vhs version."
2,Could anyone please explain me this film?,"Oh god, I almost fell asleep when I watched this film, perhaps my mistake was that I watched the director's cut first. I choose rent this DVD 'cause the critics say this one is an excelent sci-fi story and the director's cut is the best way to see it (?), I read that the scene of the unicorn fell over the audience's head like a dump of freezing water, well, maybe for them that meant something special but for me it meant absolutely nothing, can anybody please explain it to me? I know it has something to do with the question: Do the androids sleep with electric sheep? or something like that, and the critics here say that maybe Deckard was a cyborg, but why? I don't get it. The film for me was awful slow. Well, who knows? maybe I need to watch the original edition first in order to understand this movie."
5,The FINAL Blade Runner,"Based on the Blade Runner discussion panel at the recent San Diego Comic-Con, this edition should be the the last word on the Ridley Scott film, Blade Runner. The panel included the legendary director himself answering fan questions. The material on the five discs should be almost all there is, including all 5 versions like the new ""Final Cut"" that has the recent footage of Joanna Cassidy redoing her death scene where she barrels thru the plate class. The fan favorite ""The Work Print"" is also included, along with documentaries and 1 disc full of scenes. For the fans of Blade Runner, the film inspired by P.K. Dick's brilliant novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", the five-disc Ultimate C.E. is a must. And it comes in the neat ""Deckard Case"", and Amazon has it listed at $69.99 as a pre-order. And that is the Blu-Ray version for $30 less the list price. At that price it's a steal. I just ordered mine, and I recommend any fan to do the same."
3,All eye candy; little substance.,"I read the book it's based on in the seventies and loved it. I saw the movie when it came out and my first thought; after the eye candy wore off, was that it just did not do justice to the book.The making of disc shows that the film makers didn't like the book. The final screenwriter says it's short on narrative. It's Scott's vision.It perpetuates the myth that humans come first. That isn't true in the book. In the book, being human doesn't make one a better human. In the movie the bots are just vicious killers. They should be wiped out.Having said that, it is still one of the best examples of set decoration and production values ever filmed. Alas not much else."
4,Worth every penny at a reasonable price.,"One of my favorite films, and now one of my favorite box sets that I own. The only difference between the DVD and the Bluray edition is the huge price difference and the actual packaging of the discs. Everything you get is the same in each edition except for the following differences that you should be aware of:1.Bluray Edition: Discs are held inside plastic keep case, nothing special.DVD Edition: Discs are kept in a cool digi pack which is kept inside a cardboard slip case and has embossed lines and textures similar to the attache case. Inside the digi pack is very well executed with colorful photo montage and well thought out layout.2.Bluray Edition: More expensive.DVD Edition: Quite cheap now to buy, bought mine for 24.99 still sealed."
2,No Narration? The DVD isn't all there.,"The directors cut is a nice ""flavor"" of the Blade Runner movie, but it's the narration that gives the character Deckard human qualities. And what's wrong with that?We can stand on a pedestal and preach how smart we are in watching a movie with no narration, but I personally like the human Deckard. I was disappointed that the ""end all to Blade Runner movie"" flavors left out the narration. If you were told that the narrated version was really the ""Director's Cut"", would it add less value to the present ""Director's Cut""?The added goodies in the DVD are nice. The sound is great, though getting really digital does make it a little stale. One nice plus about the DVD, is you can pause it to get a look at Los Angeles 18 years from now."
2,This movie is just atrocious.,"I've read so many good reviews and bad reviews of this Ridley Scott Film Noir/Science Fiction thriller that I became confused as to how good it really is. Well I finally bought it and watched it. Want the truth? It is a slow, unnecessarily complex movie about androids and humans. It is cold, violent, and none-to-bright either. However, the movie's architectural designs and the fact that it was based on a Philip K. Dick novel certainly make it interesting...but it just isn't that good. Cast (especially Ford) excells. Director's Cut does nothing to improve it either."
1,ZERO star rating,"I probably should have payed closer attention to what the ""directors cut"" did not include. I thought the other version with Sean Young and Harrison Ford flying off together was definitely a four star rating. And that unicorn dream sequence? Whats up with that? My advice... don't waste your money on this one."
4,Blad Runner - The Final Cut,This was a fine dvd; the only caveat I have is that the director's cut did not have the monologues spoken by Harrison Ford expressing his thoughts on his actions and feelings. Someone seeing this version for the first time would definitely benefit from the added explanation of the plot.
4,blade runner,"Blade Runner is by far one of the best movies ever made. In this box set you get everything! Even a tiny metal unicorn and spinner car. The extras a really cool, and the ""Making Of.."" videos are awesome. I even love the box it comes in. It looks like Deckard's briefcase. Great purchase."
1,Does not include multiple language tracks,"The product details in Amazon say it has German, Hungarian, and Japanese language tracks. This is a lie. Instead it appears this false advertising merely refers to one phrase spoken by one character near the begging of the movie. If you're thinking of bying this movie to watch it in another language, look elsewhere."
2,Mindless action. Buy the book instead!,"This movie is good if you have nothing better to do than sit at home and watch TV. I read the book (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) and loved it. I thought the video was 'dumbed-down' far to much and lost all origional meaning. Just sex and violence with no moral. Don't get me wrong, sex and violence is great entertainment, but it shouldn't be used to butcher a excellent novel. READ THE BOOK!!!"
5,"Simply the best, 25 years ago, or 25 years later","One the best scifi movie ever made, an instant classic, and so visionnary, it's scarry....Each time I am sitting in front of my computer, zooming inside digital picture, it remind me of the movie...."
1,"Bad movie, bad DVD","Having heard the buzz for many years and being a science fiction fan, I got Blade Runner. Big mistake.Some of you raving about the missing voiceover ought to take a moment and think about what the movie - to a first-time viewer - is without it: A boring dectective story with little or no detail. The only explainer we get is at the beginning of the movie - one whole paragraph. Otherwise, we're left to judge for ourselves what's happening in 2019 LA. I don't mind complicated stories. Love them. But this one was incomprehensible.A unicorn? Sorry, if you're not a fan and no one tells you that replicants dream that way, then you've got no idea what it means. AND NO ONE TELLS YOU WHAT IT MEANS. NOT EVEN A HINT!I do have to give the nod for the ending. The redeption of the replicant in the final conflict is touching. But I didn't know enough about him or Deckard to care all that much.Plus, there are no special features on the disc. Really a bad buy in my book."
4,Directors cut not as good,"Personally, I prefer the original release. I liked the voice over and the happy ending. I thought the Unicorn dream thing was kind of off the subject. I've been trying to find a copy of the original release but no luck so far. Overall the movie is still one of my favorites of all time. I even had the PC Game. Directors cuts aren't always better in my opinion, look at the crap they are releasing for Star Wars these days with scenes added that are no use to the plot and most are so obvious. The only recent extended version of a movie I really enjoyed was of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. These extended versions were fantastic. But still, if you like Sci-fi I think Bladerunner is a winner."
3,I consider this cut more confusing for newbies,"People new to Blade Runner will probably not like this movie as much as the original with the narration (not available anymore, as far as I know). While Harrison Ford's narration has its weaknesses, it clarifies the story and keeps the viewer ""tuned in."" Without it, I think the movie gets a bit confusing without repeated viewing and without the knowledge the original narration communicated.I believe the editorial review to be incorrect. At the time of the Director's Cut release, Ridley Scott acknowledged that the original release of the movie had his approval and that he had added the narration because he felt moviegoers would not understand the movie very well. I don't believe this is a case where the studio executives ""stole"" the picture from the director and forced their own changes."
3,I Want My Narration Back!,"The magnificence of the original screen release was not only the fantastic future vistas created by Syd Mead but the ""film noir"" grit which was added with Harrison Ford's fine effort. The narration gave color and dimension to an otherwise lifeless script and made us feel for a character. Without the narration, all the characters appear as if they are replicants."
1,The great Blade Runner Swindle,"This is not a Director's Cut, but a half-finished edition, recovered in storage somewhere in LA and let loose on the public. Okay, the theatre version was not Ridley Scott's vision. But neither is this. This half-baked movie started the entire Director's Cut-madness, the greatest [cheat] the companies ever made to make us buy and watch the same movies more times.Please, let me have the original(!) theatre version of this fine movie? Please?"
5,Liked Orignal,Watched all versions and still liked original release best. Worth it though last movie to use minitures instead of cgi and blue screen. DEL
3,Should Have Left the VHS version alone,"I happen to like the VHS version much, much, better than the DVD. I own both, but I will not look at the DVD version again. The narration was great and so was the ending of the VHS movie."
5,sensational,"i find it amazing to find people preferring the original rather than the directors cut. The fact that people prefer the voiced over edition shows the undemanding audiance the film business has produced. for a start the original has no real point to the story. it might be quicker and easier to watch but it loses out in the intensity. The directors cut holds so many tragic meanings that it surely is a piece of art rather than the original, which is just a contempory."
4,interesting but...,"After seeing the Original release and then the Director Cut, I was a little disappointed. The DC lacks the original voice-over by Ford that (imo) adds some sort of connection between the scenes. The DC does have some extra footage that makes in worth viewing but not that much and the ending of the DC is different. I believe that Blade Runner is still a great movie but I would have rather seen much more of the cut footage (like Decker visiting Holden in the hospital - a scene that is not in any released version) with the voice-over (narration by Ford). Still it is worth watching and maybe adding to your collection. END"
3,"good, but liked theactrical version better","I found the narative of the theactrical cut to help the film along better than without it. I still enjoyed the movie though. I wish I could find a theactrical version, but it seems they all just disappeared. Someone tell me if they know where I can get that version. Blade Runner is one of the finest science fiction films that I have seen."
5,Great detail in the picture!,"I got this as a gift for my husband because it's his favorite movie. He must have seen it a million times and even went to NY to see it in a theatre when it was re-released for on one of it's anniversaries. My point is that when we put on the Blu-Ray version, he said he could see so many things that he has never seen before. I think his favorite part was the opening scene with all the detail in the buildings. He was just in awe.He would say that this is a must have for any Blade Runner fan!"
3,"Beware of ""Director's Cut"" changes","""Blade Runner"" is one of my favorite movies. I have owned it in every format, and when the ""Director's Cut"" DVD became available, I bought it immediately and sold my Embassy LD of the original theatrical release: I should ahve watched the DVD first. Several of Deckard's speeches have been deleted, most notably the one that he makes after the death of Roy Baddy. In addition, the end sequence, in which Deckard and Rachel are flying ""North"" has been removed. If this is the way Ridley Scott really wanted the movie to be, he was wrong."
3,How 'bout rereleasing the original version?,"While it's still a good flick, the director's cut can't hold a candle to the original version. Harrison Ford's world-weary narration makes the movie stand apart from the herd. I would much prefer to have a copy of the original myself. Incidently, did you know that Dustin Hoffman was originally slated to play Decker? Jeez."
1,Disappointing and Witless,"I've loved this series, but I guess it's come to its end. The early books were charming, funny, and had great wit. And the first Lardo books were excellent. But this book and the one before it sound as if they were written by someone who never read a McNally book.The McNally character is lost completely, as is the witty style. Archie is unrecognizable. All the sophistication and wordplay are gone. The writing is awkward, and the plot uninteresting. All in all, a major disappointment."
4,Overall I liked it,"It's about time Binky stood up for himself; I got the impression that Archie (grudgingly) respects that.As for romance, Archy and Connie are sooooooo not split up. Georgie is a rebound affair that's run its course; I hope she and Archy remain friends. For me, having him living with a squeeze is close enough to marrying him off; either go whole hog, hitch him and end the series - or move him back to his aerie."
3,Good But Read Better,I really like that Vincent Lardo is getting handle on the McNally Character and Binky character is become more of a man than mouse. The ending of this novel was very good and with a clifhanger.But this constant sparing between Consuela and Archy it's becoming too much. Archy needs make up his mind about who he wants. I personally would like Archy and Consuela back together. While I like McNally Bluff this wasn't his personal best.
2,Missing something...,"Why don't they take Lawrence Sanders' name off the McNally books? Vincent Lardo obviously hasn't studied them in depth, since he makes mistakes with reference to Sanders' stories. Archy states he doesn't want to get married if he can't have a marriage as perfect as his parents. Lardo apparently is unaware that the ""pater"" had an affair in one of Sanders' installments! Archy isn't quite the same guy and is becoming quite the annoying snob. Al Rogoff was hardly in this one and I missed him. Archy's living with a girlfriend and there are few references to the McNally ""manse"", dinners with the folks, etc. And the climax was anything but; a true anticlimax that was over before I realized. Time to hang up the series? I do believe."
5,Educational!,Bought this for my son's montessori school. It was on there wishlist from a magazine and as usual I went to amazon first and got a great deal!! Love this as it teaches kids the importance of our beautiful earth. Great tool in educationing younger children through music while still fun!
5,Good Read!,I think that this book is great! The two main characters are very sweet and entertaining and the story is truly romantic and at times very funny. It is a definite keeper for me.
3,A good book to pass the time...,"""A Rogue's Pleasure"" was a good book with good characters. I enjoyed both Anthony and Chelsea very much....Anthony especially. I thought it was refreshing how open he was with his feelings for Chelsea. He never pretended not to feel for her,in fact, he declares himself very early on...it was very sweet actually. So why only 3 stars? For some reason I cant name, this book failed to grab me. I found myself putting it down again and again...flipping ahead to see how much was left. The plot wasnt all that entertaining, and the villian was very obvious. All in all a pleasant read, but not a keeper for me."
4,Hope Tarr can weave a rich tale.....,"I found Hope Tarr recently and finished a few of her books. Her characters are dynamic and interesting, her plots original and her books well written. Just the right amount of descriptions and a delightful dialogue. I am anxious to read another of her books and look forward to her writing something new."
3,Solid film noir mystery,"Not a great movie, nor a horrible movie. Just a good solid film noir mystery. Worth spending the time watching."
4,Fun for Fans,"Columbia has found an interesting item in its vaults, a live set by the Byrds aggregation that recorded Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde back in 1969. This is mostly the country-tinged rock that the Byrds favored at this time, with a little medley thrown in to appease those old fogies in the audience who still wanted to hear the folk-rock hits that first brought fame to the band way back in the mid-'60s. There is nothing really profound or revelatory here, but it is great fun to hear the group in concert, and the sound is surprisingly good considering its pedigree and vintage. For Byrds fans, this release will be a must-have."
4,Byrds rock the fillmore,Byrds live at the fillmore is a great live album from the byrds at Fillmore east and features some of the best songs performed live amd is highly recommended.
3,A nice cross section of Byrds' tunes,"I enjoyed the album a lot. Some of the ""old"" David Crosby era tunes mixed in with the newer ""country"" Byrds songs. I always liked ""Drug Store Truck Drivin Man"" and a neat surprise for C&W fans is the Byrd's version of Buck Owen' intrumental ""Buckaroo"""
4,One Month After Dr Byrds And Mr Hyde Comes Live At The Fillmore.,"This is the earliest Byrds live album I know of.16 tracks, mostly from the 1967 -1969 era.There are some rarities here and they are all very good, namely Close Up The Honky Tonks, the instrumental Buckaroo and Sing Me Back Home.Naturally a live album cannot match the production standards and often retakes of a studio recording, all the same this is well worth a listern.Top of the pile for me is So You Want To Be A Rock ""N"" Roll Star.Byrds fans are likely to enjoy this from start to finnish."
4,time travel,"If I could, there would be three things to see. 1) the landing in Roswell 2) Kennedy's assassintation 3) the byrds. These guys are exhausting to listen to. The voice is on the edge of eternity, the guitar (b-bender inventor) is unbelievable. It's difficult to imagine such a concert. On disc on this release is worth much more than the going price. The sound quality may not be up to par for some audiophiles but #$%# them, they still think vinyl sounds better than CD's."
4,Does its job,"Thought I would test this out with all of the good reviews it got. Put it on my nails and the polish stayed on for about 3 days, but that's because I wash the dishes without gloves by that time. I use my hands a lot; when I used my hands the way I do everyday, not a chip in sight. Unfortunately, not base coat can survive dishpan soaked hands. You will have to use gloves (which I don't like) when washing dishes in order to keep your polish on."
2,Slight and forgettable but watchable enough,"The Main Event is a not particularly funny star vehicle reuniting Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal as a broke perfume mogul and the hopeless boxer who is her sole remaining asset. It's no What's Up, Doc?, but it's pleasant enough, coasting on the stars' likeability and offering just enough funny moments for you to feel you're not entirely wasting your time. However, the vintage making of documentary on the DVD (which includes a lengthy deleted scene) really gives away how much times have changed, as O'Neal and the screenwriters make genial lighthearted jokes about wife-beating..."
4,"""The Main Event""","This is a good Barbra Streisand -- Ryan O' Neal comedy, about boxing.It is not as good as the other film that they made together (""What's Up, Doc?"")."
2,What's good about this movie?,"That's a hard one to answer. I did smile once or twice, but even Barbra's most ardent fans will struggle to like this lame effort. The trouble is that there's nothing clever about it. So anybody who likes 'What's Up, Doc?' and thinks, Great, another Streisand/O'Neal movie I will enjoy, well, think again. Ryan O'Neal tries to be cute, but it looks like it's hard for him. Barbra's character is confusing: she starts as a high-powered business woman, but later in the film slips into 'vulnerable silly woman' character half the time. What's going on?And do we need another movie with endless scenes of boxing? No doubt they needed something to fill up the empty spaces in the plot, between the embarrassing 'that would NEVER happen' bits that spoil so much comedy.So what's good about this movie? Well, if you like Barbra Streisand, you get to see her, albeit with probably her worst ever hairdo. If it was anybody else, I'd give this one star, and grudgingly."
3,"Funny, Entertaining but I've seen better","The Main Event was the first Streisand picture I ever saw. I loved it at the theaters. But since then I've seen many more of her movies on VHS. I have to say it's a good film but not her best. I liked ""Yentl"" or ""Owl & Pussycat"" or ""A Star Is Born"" much better. Her acting is superb, so is Ryan's. But the storyline is a little weak compared to other movies she is in. I reccommend it its just not her very best movie."
4,A very funny movie!,"THIS FILM ABOUT AN EX-BOXER (O'neil) AND A BANCRUPT EXECUTIVE (STRIESAND) IS REALLY A GOOD THING TO WATCH. THEIR CHEMISTRY REALLY WORKS IN THIS FILM.THEIR NEVER ENDING ARGUEMENTS SERVES AS A SPICE TO ENHANCE THE ROMANTIC AND COMEDIC APPEAL OF THIS FILM.NOT TO MENTION THE SCENE STEALING PART OF D'ARBANVILLE AS THE WOMAN WHO HAS A BAD COUGH.BUT THE CENTER OF THIS FILM IS STILL REVOLVING AROUND THE BIG MOUTHED STRIESAND WHO ONCE AGAIN PROVE THAT SHE REALLY IS THE ""FUNNY GIRL"".WETHER YOU'RE AN STRIESAND FAN OR NOT THIS MOVIE WILL SURELY MAKE YOU LAUGH HARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
1,Threw code p0133 p133,"I don'y normally review things on this site, but after my experience with this junk, I hope I can save someone a headache. Don't buy it. Plain and simple, I put this in because my old 02 sensors failed from a bad thermostat which cause the truck to run rich and foul the sensors, put these in and a week later threw both of these codes, checked the wiring, checked for an exhaust leak, nothing. finally, tried an acdelco o2 sensor. code has not come back on since. if anything i think the acdelco one is only $5 more, and is what came factory with most gmc vehicles. save time and hassle and just spend the extra money. believe me, its worth it."
2,Win some. Lose some.,You win some and you lose some. This purchase was a definite loss. What a dissapointment.
4,His most electronic sounding release yet,"Listeners who felt a little short-changed with Four Tet's previous releases due to their somewhat leisurely paced nature, should find ""Everything Ecstatic"" a refreshing album.Here we have a far more buoyant and assured release, with less of the ""pling plong"" found on Pause and Rounds. It sounds like Kieran Hebden was perhaps listening to a lot of Fluke or Advokat whilst making this record.Also, for the first time, it appears that he has done away with any clear ""music style fusion"" concept. Here, he toys with many styles, including jazz, funk, progressive rock, and, even acid house! Yep, there are 303's and 909's making their presence here.Standout tracks are ""Sun Drums and Soil"" and ""And Then Patterns"". Great stuff."
4,"Funky, loose, and fun.","That's what I would describe Four Tet's Everything Esctatic. It sounds like it was a blast to make. Kieran Hebden is the man behind Four Tet, and his IDM/funkish songs sound really joyous. Take the first track ""A Joy,"" a song with a lot of out-of-time effects running through a skippy beat and pulsating bass. What really makes the track though is the constant beat underlying it. Smile Around The Face is another joyous upbeat song, with some chipmunk soul singers and powerful drumming.Other tunes are more experimental, such as the jazzy ""Sun Drums and Soil,"" the dark and moody ""And Then Patterns"", and the quiet minamalism of ""You Were There With Me."" There is a constant flow to the album, and the feel is like being surrounded by life.On the whole, this is album that just makes you feel good. You can groove to it, play it in the background while doing other things, or play it at a party. It's quite a good enviroment to be in."
4,Trash but good trash.....,"While it is agreed this book is a definate dishonour to jean harlow's memory. One should be smart enough to realize it is still one of the best trashy pulp reads i have ever experienced. Irving shulman is regarded as one of the best pulp novelists with his stories about life on the streets circa 1940's. This film noir treatment of harlow's life maybe inacurrate, but it is still an entertaining read that would make jackie collins green with envy. If one also reads nathanel west's novel, ""day of the locust"", One could feel it is an companion piece to this other fictonal work detailing side of hollywood life one rarely wishes to think about."
4,Hit of the Party,"This is a wonderful book that has all you need for a typical kid's party. I like the paterns that are included. Take them to a copier, add color paper and you are done! I highly recommend this book to anyone who will be having a kid's party soon!"
3,Well worth the $10!,This book was well worth the $10 I paid for it. It has lots of fun ideas and easy recipes. The only problem is you need a copier machine to make most of the craft ideas. It also doesn't have color photos but it is still nice.
4,"Though published decades ago,still relevant/useful","This book was originally written for bureaucrats so that they might better communicate officialese. Yet it really goes further: it can be used, appreciated, by anyone wishing to improve or confirm their knowledge of written English. Gowers writes in compact, sometimes dryly humourous, style, as he corrects the often confused use of ""which-that"" and ""who-whom"", the employment or negligence of the subjunctive, and punctuation. It's an enjoyable,educative work relevant to today, with the English language changing and, perhaps, degrading."
5,A great book to enter into an understanding of the Church!,"This book explains that the Church is a life - not a place where people follow a bunch of old rules. Giussani brilliantly explains what constitutes this church, what its mission is, what it claims to be, and what it is not. A great book to enter into an understanding of what the Catholic Church really is, from someone on the inside of this life. If you are not a believer I would venture to say it would make you curious about this phenomenon that was started 2000 years ago by a carpenter's son from Nazareth. If already a believer, I think that it will educate you to a deeper understanding of what it is and expel some notions about it that are false. An indispensable book for any Catholic or any person who really wants to know what the church claims to be in history."
1,not sure about this guy....,"I havent heard this album yet, and dont plan on it. Ive heard his two singles ""Times Up"" and ""Why"" and personally i thought they sucked. The main reason is well, jadakiss's voice. I mean his little laugh at the beginning of ""Why"" and mostly all of his songs is just gay and stupid. And also is his song ""why"" he says, and i quote ""Why the whole world love my voice""... the whole world loves your voice? man i hate your voice, its probably one of the most anoyying voices ive ever heard. I wont deny though, this guy can rap and he has some good lyrics, but his voice alone just makes me stay away from this stuff."
1,GARBAGE...Its Sad,Jada is a really good rapper..it's too bad his album really sucked...don't buy it ..TImez Up is probably the only song on there thats bangin
1,Sorry,"Jada I'm sorry I hate too do this , but it ain't that good.Only 2 tracks I likeWhy??Still feel me"
1,JADAKISS IS AWFUL!!!!,"jadakiss is one of the most hyporcrytical ignorant rappers out there today just listen to that song ""why"" (which is somehow popular) and you will see he is jadakiss deserves to be dissed by 50 cent because he sucks his voice is anoying and he is so arrogant even though so many people hate him. Jadakiss rapping is not your game go do sumtin else and stop making crappy music for people to have the misfortune to hear"
3,its hot in its own way,"i mean.... its ok, but I heard all da tracks b4 it even dropped. da s*** its kinda garbage, aint no tracks i can really get down wit. da album is a cd that u skip thru 2 find a song 2 listen 2. Da good tracks is Bring You Down, Real Hip-Hop, Shoot Outs, Still Feel Me, By your Side, Air it Out, and da 1 wit Kanye West is iight, so is da 1 wit eminem. da album is not better then da 1st one. Sheek Cd is better 2. Sheek had da best CD of all da album."
5,Jadakiss is tight!!!,"Yo man if you don't got this album yet you seriously missin out. It's these kind of albums that make me pround of hip-hop. Jadakiss keeps it real with his best work. The hit single ""Time's Up"" is the reason i bought it and i am extremely happy i did cuz the rest of the album is also bangin. The other single ""Why"" is awesome cuz he talks about real situations in life except i think he judges Bush too harshly. Another good single is tha ""Welcome to D-Block"" which has an awesome chorus by Eminem and guests Styles P. and Sheek and this song tells u about life on the streetz and how hard it can be. ""Shine"" is also tight, feat. Snoop Dogg and DJ Quik and it has a good beat and chorus, and DJ Quik has an awesome guest appearance. Once again, if u don't have this album buy it so u can get the effect of this guy and his style."
3,Hmm...,"A lyricist like Jada is known for tricky wordplay, slick metaphors, and solid overall quality. Songs like ""Time's Up"", ""Why"", ""Shoot Outs"", ""Welcome to D-Block"", and ""Still Feel Me"" show that kind of great music. Those aren't the only solid tracks on the album, but that isn't important right now. What is important is how akward the other songs feel. Corny, and half-assed songs like ""Hot Sauce 2 Go"" make you ask Why? The album is pretty well done, but some of the tracks just bring down your good-rap high. Overall, it is a pretty well done album, but hopefully the next album from 1/3 of the Lox will touch up on these problems and shine to the full potential of a cat named Jadakiss."
4,Good effort.,"Overall I think this was a good effort from the ""kisser"" muaaah. Most of the songs had substance and were catchy. Although there were a few fillers I would recommend this album to people who actually read these reviews. The songs I liked in particular are: time's up, u make me wanna, hot sauce to go, getting it in and welcome to d-block. The one song I really did not care for was why. I am african american but I do not condon accusing someone such as Bush for such a great atrocity as the twin towers bombing. Other than that miscue it is obvious that kiss has matured into a great artist."
2,I don't know,"I thought this album was going to be good and I was wrong. I was expecting to hear something that would take me to another level, like the Kiss the Game Goodbye album. People might boot leg this album, instead of buying it......."
5,"Everything contraversial, underground gansta rap /commercial","This album is fire! For not being too deep or having too many subjects(like Nas, Talib, Rakim, Mos Def, Common, the roots) he is amazin on the mic. Nest I have heard since God Son.

3,my opinion?,"bootleg this album. the hot songs are; times up, why, real hip hop, by ur side, welcome to d-block and kiss of death. this is a good album but it only has 6 good songs out of 18. im dissapointed jada."
4,Great Sophomore Effort,"I never got a chance to hear Jadakiss' first album. I first decided to check out his sophomore album when I first heard the Styles P album. When I heard the first single ""Times Up"" featuring Nate Dogg I was determine to hear this album. After listening to this album, it is definitely proven true that Jadakiss has the lyrical word play skill that is lacking in many artists today. Production is great, definitely above average level. The second single ""why"" has a great depth. As a matter of fact, this whole album has depth unlike many other new releases. Guest appearances are also great, many RR artists and Eminem made his appearances. After all that said, there was something lacking. In many songs, you find the hook repetive and boring instead of the catchy ones by Nate Dogg, and ""Why"" with Anthony Hamilton, other than that flaw, this album is definitely a great CD to cop.Lyrics: AProduction: B+Delivery: B+Overall: A-"
3,7 out of 10 stars,"after hearing times up i was counting down the days until this came out. When i got it i was just like, these disco beats r weird as hell n y is this so bad. I thought that this cd was going to b the zhit. The best songs r:ShineTimes upGettin it InReal Hip-HopShootoutsMighty D-BlockBy Your SideStill Feel MeAir it Out"
2,a typical mainstream album,"i heard why and times up and welcome to d block, and i really liked them, anyone i knew that bought it said it was amazing, so i thought it might acually not be as wack as tha rest of tha stuff ppl are puttin out these days.....but i was sadly mistaken, those where tha only good tracks tha rest is unoriginal, unreal, and hes talkin about ice, rims, girls, and killen ppl, he actually says he is rapping for fame on one part of tha album.....THIS IS HIP POP NOT HIP HOP, not for real hip hop fansP.S. Idont know why i even bought it"
2,"truth be told, it's worst than his first","I couldnt believe my ears when i put this on it's wack and there isnt much to say bout it""why"",""times up"" and ""Shoot outs"" are the dopest tracks on here everything else is wack. trust"
5,JadaKiss - Kiss Of Death - Do Yourself A Favor Get This Gem,"This album is one of the best albums i have heard this year. I am not a rap fan in any sense of the word but Jadakiss is awesome. I cant deny this album...He's only gonna get bigger, Anybody that likes Jada get this album its a gem"
2,Buy The Mixtape,"After listening to THE CHAMP IS HERE mixtape, I was really looking forward to this album. However, when I bought it and listened to it, I was greatly disappointed. Being that Jada is one of the best metaphoric rappers in the game makes it even worse. This album consist of TOO MUCH R+B. It's obvious that Jada was trying to make some dough by going mainstream. There is so much filler in the first 3/4 of the album, that you are already bored by the time anything interesting happens. Although it's killng me to write this review, I have to be honest. Even though I'm a fan, I can't just give 5 stars because of that, like some reviewers have done. If you can get your hands on THE CHAMP IS HERE mixtape, then you'll have a real Jadakiss album."
1,How the heck can people say this is the best of '04?,"It makes no sense, have you evern acknowledged that rjd2 came out with a new album? How about blockheads new album? And of course the MF Doom/Madlib creation Madvillainy absolutley trahses this piece of commercial junk. Theres more to rap than the fruity mainstream kids, look underground for real rap."
5,Kiss Of Death Gets 5 STARS,"Jadas got some sick words, his cd is great jada is my second fav rapper, DMX IS #1 hands down (no effece jada dont take it the wrong way bro you rule also :) )"
4,J TO THA MUAH!!!,"I REALLY DONT FEEL LIKE TYPIN RIGHT NOW BUT YEAH, JADA DOES IT AGAIN. BUT HE DIDNT REALLY TOP KISS THA GAMR GOODBYE. BUT HIS WHY TRACK WAS REAL AS HELL."
2,This was dull,"Jadakiss has skill in rhyming words and spiting on the mic but this album doesnt catch me into liking it. some of the songs like the one with Mariah Carey is bad. and some songs have some really horrible beats that dont go with certain songs. The only ones I really liked was ""What you so mad at"" and ""Why"" but ""Why"" got played out and then i got sick of it."
4,The Champ Is Here!!!!!!!,"This is the hottest joint of the sumer!!Now it;'s Jada's time 2 shine.(...) The best songs on the CD is ""Why"" ""U Make Me Wanna"" ""Shoot Outs"" ""Welcome To D-Block"" n ""Kiss Of Death"""
5,jadakiss delivers a great album,"This may be the greatest album so far of 2004.Jadakiss delivers some great lyrics to go along with the excellent beats. The good songs on this album are the hit singles ""why"" and ""times up"".Other great songs are ""U make me wanna"",""kiss of death"",and ""welcome to d-block"".Ther are some good guests on this album and even though im not a fan of Mariah Carey the song she guest appears on ""U make me wanna""is the best song on the album.The only bad song on this record would be""hot sauce to go""which features Pharrell and of course is produced by the neptunes.I highly recomment this album for any rap fan out there,you will not be disappointed"
3,COO,"I GIVE IT 3 STARS, I LIKED IT, IT WAS COO! NOT GANGSTA ENOUGH THOU!!BUT THE GROUP ALBUM SPICE 1 DID WITH MC EIHT ""THE PIONEERS""!! NOW THAT'S A CLASSIC ALL THE WAY THROUGH! I GIVE THAT ONE 5 STARS! WELL WORTH THE MONEY!!"
4,"The album is tight, like him or not","Overall, this is a good cd. The lyrics are on point. Some of the beats are a little off, but the lyrics clearly make this cd. Jadakiss is definitely a lyricist."
2,Jada's Kiss Of Death...to his fans,"This album is very well named b/c i think this is his ""Kiss Of Death"" to all his fans so he can get everyone to stop listening to him. I've never been a huge Jada fan to begin with but this album i was actually hyped about gettin but of course as you can see from the rating i thought it was very poorly done and the only reason i gave 2 stars was for the track ""Why"" which i love the way he put that song together although i think the beat to it is very annoying but in my opinion this album is very weak and trying a bit too hard to be commercial and radio-friendly, what is wrong with most rappers today? albums like this really are the reason behind P2P file sharing b/c everything is bull, only a select few are staying true to the meaning of hip-hop. Forget this album dont waste your money"
3,good but could of been better,"Jadakiss is one of my favorite mc's and i had high hopes for this album. His first album ""kiss the game goodbye"" was bangin and full of hot songs. While this album is good its not as good as his first album. First let me state why...this album is not true Jadakiss...there is alot of party and just plain girly songs on here to attract main stream pop culture listeners. And it worked...Jada sold alot of albums. But other than those songs Jada shines on his true street songs with great lyrics like always and a good flow. IF U ARE LOOKING TO GET INTO JADAKISS PICK UP HIS FIRST ALBUM ""KISS THE GAME GOODBYE"" FIRST, THEN PICK THIS ALBUM UP ANOTHER TIME...TRUST ME...HIS FIRST ALBUM IS WAY BETTER...But it deserves 3 stars because half the album is good and they have good lyrics, flow, and production but the other half is trying to appeal to the pop culture/main stream listeners and it just dosnt sound like jadakiss."
2,this makes kiss 0-2,"I am a big Jadakiss fan but im not going to pretend this garbage is good. I gave him a pass on the first album cause it had a few ill tracks. This time around he some how thinks hes a big star like Jay-z or something. Times up is a lame attempt to attract the west coast. Jadakiss enlists the best producers in the game again but ends up with the same lame result. If it wasn't for the havoc produced why, Kiss would be dropped by interscope. I see why columbia didn't want Beyonce to be on this trash so they ended up with washed up mariah. Kiss you wanna be top 5 dead or alive?! Try putting out a album with at least 5 good songs for once."
2,Disappointment,"This CD in my opinion is a huge disappointment. I was pumped for it, Jada's normally on fire, but this one is just sad with the exception of a few tracks. You listen to Jada for gritty mean get pumped up lyrics. Lyrics like ""K-I-S-S me, i just wanna make love"" do not get me pumped up. and the song ""why"" i think must be in there so that rainbow coalition wusses will buy this. I'll listen to love songs if i want to hear a love song. i listen to jada for hard-core pissed off music with hilarious and awesome puns. this will only please kids who listen to the softer stuff on day time tv."
5,that guy up there should shut up...,"This is one of the best albums that I have bought in a long time.The person who reviewed the album above and who wrote that long reply has nothing better to do. Get a life, man. He also pointed out a lot of wrong things. He said that rappers are some of the wealthiest people in the world. WRONG. Rappers who THINK they are the wealthiest people in the world give you the wrong image. Jadakiss would know, right? He IS a rapper, right? And who are you? Some white guy who thinks he would rather review a rap album that he doesn't like than listen to his country music? Either get a life, or get your facts straight. Obviously, you're not really into rap because if you were, you would realize that this is a great CD and even if you dont like Jadakiss, you'll like the album."
2,what the hell did he just say,"Why did Bush knock down the towers??I can't believe he said that sh*t.This guy is an idiot, screw his lyrics, f**k this guy.That song 'Why' sucks anyways. Many of us know about the struggle, I don't need to hear him bitch and cry about it."
3,Just average,"Overall kiss of death is just an average album i thought it would be alot better than kiss the game goodbye cuz that one was also just average.But jada let me down on this album with only a few songs that were actually good being times up,why,u make me wanna,shoot outs,still feel me(sick beat by the alchemist),gettin it in(another crazy beat by kanye),and welcome to d-block with em.Other than that the rest of the songs werent really that good."
4,one of the best all around this year,"i dont know what all yall other dudes are talkin about this album is hot! i'm not gonna say ""great"", but its definitely one of the better rap albums this year in my opinion. someone said that they thought ""hot sauce"" featuring farrell was the worst songs this year? (...) dun, what you messed up on? that song is one of the best tracks on the album! i love the hook, and the beat is nasty. stop the hate and learn to appreciate!now i will say this: this is definitely not what you'd call grimy hip-hop, but it is very enjoyable and fun. if you want something hard, real gangsta (...), go for lloyd banks, who's killin it with ""hunger for more""! thats all i got to say!"
4,"raps with passion, but seems to lack some finese","I really like what Jada raps about, I just don't hear very many jaw dropping flows that make me say ""damn!"" I'll have to say that this is a very good album with incrdable guest appearances (except Eminem who does just awful on D-block). I really like this album though, I think taht Jada isn't the best flow artist out there but he seems to rhyme about relevant things. Why is the best song on here and an appropriate selection for his first single (I love it when he asks Kobe why he had to hit that raw, why did he kiss that wh***). A mighty effort, he's going to hit the top."
3,Just as good as kiss tha game goodbye,jadakiss promised a lot for this album but its nothing very special. the production on this album isn't bad except the neptunes hot sauce to go is a song that has a bad beat which is very unusual for a neptunes beat and the kanye beat is below mediocre n we all know how good of a producer kanye is. i think jada's flow may've improved on this album but his lyrics haven't. there's also a lotta dorky r&b which doesn't really go with jada. overall its a good album but it should've and could've been a lot better.
3,Not as Expected,"This is a decent cd. Its got some good tracks but it was much different than I thought it would be. Usually, RR is hardcore all the way through and this cd isn't. I expected it to have heavy beats and good flow like the usual double R style but this was softer. Still good, but not usual RR tracks."
4,The voice of hip hop,"A talented story teller and hilarious one-liners! Jada Kiss cracks me up all the time.He is intense as a rapper and always seems to 'tell it as it is',no gimmicks!I can see Jada going places seriously in the near future,this guy is talented,fullstop!I just wish there were more 'heavy beats' amongst the songs,you know,something from Premo,Pete Rock or similar..."
2,Another mainstream disappointment,"yet again, it has happened. a promising rapper has become victim to the industry. its not really jada's fault, cuz all the money's controlled by only a couple suits at the top, but this album represents everything that is wrong with hip hop today. gimme a break, this isn't music, this is a lame ploy to make money. too bad it had to be jadakiss that had to sell out though."
5,Probably The Last True Record From Ruff Ryders,"I love this record.I heard alot of the songs from mixtapes,i was impresed.I got the album,sum good s***.I think this is better than Kiss Tha Game Goodbye.It's a shame Ruff Ryders are dead in the music industry.But hey S***,Move on,and i heard today That X left and Signed with Columbia and will come back out in the summer,so thats it for The Ryde Or Die n S***."
4,Beautiful,"This is a CD you can only listen to without other sonic distractions. Quiet, haunting soundscapes lay the foundation for Theo's emotional minimalist sax and flute. If you are a fan of the Silent Way side of Miles Davis, you should definitely enjoy this album."
4,Great for any lifestyle,"i use this in my everyday commute to school and when i'm out to sea. it holds my lunch, my books and tech manuals with room to spare. It's very durable and holds up well in any situation. the straps are very comfortable and easily adjustable. I like the top pocket that's designed for a CD player, i use it to keep my wallet, phone and shades. I think it's an all around great backback."
4,"""Good Carpenter Documentary DVD!""","John Carpenter: The man who brought you ""Halloween,"" Escape from New York""& more! This dvd that has everything you want to know about the famousdirector with many cast & crew interviews. I'm a big fan and own justabout all of his films. I recommend this good dvd."
3,Should be an extra on some Carpenter DVD,"It doesn't tell anything new to a Carpenter fan, but it is nice to see an hour on him. It isn't really worth putting it out on dvd, though. It should be an extra on some Carpenter DVD."
2,Why isn't there a Bogdanovich collection?,"What's Up Doc gets funnier and funnier as the years go by. You can keep the rest of the stuff here. What we need is Peter Bogdanovich's first three films as a box set - The Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc and Paper Moon. Many of the same actors in repertory, all three brilliant and all quite different. How about it Amazon?"
5,She rules!,"There simply isn't a better female singer than Barbra and this set shows off 'the voice' in some of her better roles and films. Whether she's acting or singing, or doing both [as in some] she's quite simply the queen at her craft. This set is fantastic."
5,love them,"great fit, sizing was easy to get right the first time. Seem thick enough but will no more when the weather changes."
4,Excellent Big Band Music!,"As I was searching on the internet for a specific song called ""Blues for Stephanie"" from the Big Band of Count Basie, I finally en only found it on the website of Amazon.com on one of the many CD's in their extended library. However it is a concert in his later period (1979) all the songs sounds fresh and young, and above all, swinging like only Basie's Big Band could do that. It feels like if you are part of the audience. Great music."
5,A GREAT sequel,"I consider Raffi's ""Singable Songs"" and this companion CD to be absolute must-haves for all Raffi fans. If you have been troubled by inane, annoying children's music, here is the remedy. If you are giving a gift, you can't go wrong with either one--better yet, give them both! Even adults can listen to these songs over and over without becoming sick at the thought."
2,Not happy,"This is a cheaper drive than I expected. I contacted tech support about some problems I had with this. The rattling noise that really annoys me is caused by the drive heads moving to a resting position where it ""rattles"" harmlessly. They told me its due to the fact its their low end no frills drive. I wouldn't have bought this had I known about the noise. Its very annoying.Also have a problem where the drive doesn't come up on startup. They say sometimes data gets trapped in a buffer, and the drive won't work until it clears the buffer. But since its ""data"" the drive is refusing to purge it. Usually unplugging the power and removing the USB cable for a minute does the trick. But not this time..... I may have a nonfunctioning drive until I can get to a repair shop when they open on monday....Very unhappy right now."
3,Ouch.... this one needs work....,"My kids always loved Raffi when they were younger, and now my little one enjoys listening to Raffi, but Raffi Radio was a clear disappointment to us. This is not as enjoyable to listen to because of all of the interuptions. What 4-5 year-old likes listening to the weather? Not my kids, that's for sure. Especially when what Raffi was saying doesn't even apply. Not a great way to entertain young children."
5,"A great kids CD, and adults will enjoy it too","This is a really refreshing CD for kids and parents. Most of the music is more sophisticated than Raffi's other music, and maybe that's why I like it so much. It's a pleasant change from all the hyper, bouncy songs that us parents get tired of. My four-year-old really enjoys this CD."
4,Great Format for Listening in the Car,"While this isn't the usual Raffi format, my son loves it. He is 8 and slightly autistic. He recently discovered Raffi music from an old CD that we had from when our teenagers were little, and has absolutely fallen in love with all things Raffi. We checked out 3 CD's from the library including this one, and this is now his favorite. I think it appeals to him on several levels--the songs are very well-done, the banter inbetween appeals to his funny little sense of humor, and the whole CD is like listening to a radio station, except it's silly and ""his"" radio station. I recommend this for older pre-schoolers who are old enough to understand the humor of the talking bits."
2,Well.....,"We love Raffi at our house -- my daughter always saves a seat for him at the dinner table. We didn't click with this album, though. It annoyed me, actually. Maybe we've ""pigeon-holed"" poor Raffi."
3,"There are better Raffi albums, spend your money on them","Briefly, the songs are wonderful, but the banter between songs is almost unlistenable. When we listen to this album we constantly have to skip the talking tracks. I would give the songs 4 or 5 stars (they are more developed than in other Raffi albums), but the witty banter gets a zero. Maybe I will feel differently when my son is five, but at age 1 we need more music. Despite my mediocre review, we still keep in the player and we still sing along."
1,"a dog book; not a ""Border Collie book""","This book is OK if you are a new dog owner. As a border collie owner this book does nothing for me. Some of the information is designed for border collie owners, but many of the pictures show other dogs. I also felt this was a ""cut and paste "" dog owner book...insert ""Border Collie"" here....a good book for new dog owners; but offers little information for Border Collie owners...chasing shadows, throw the ball, run, play, spin, come on. etc just isn't covered. If you write a book about about ""border collies"" all pictures should show border collies, and help for border collie owners of these wonderful psychotic dogs should be included...greg"
1,Terrible,"What a disappointment.The majority of this book is about dogs in general. If you're looking for information specifically about the Border Collie breed, as I was, don't waste your money. You can get 90% of what was in this book by picking up any book on dogs, and you won't know any more about Border Collies than you did before you read it."
3,The Border Collie: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet,This book was a bit of a disappointment as I was looking for some specific info on Border Collies and I felt as if any breed's name could have been substituted where they used the name Border Collie. As a general beginners book on dogs and dog training it was OK and would be worth a few bucks to buy it. Other than some nice photos of Border Collies it had nothing in it specific to this breed.
1,"2 Broken Out of the Box, old technology","Talk about cheap. We got one of these for my daughter's birthday and I was excited. I had one when I was a kid. It turned on when I put in the batteries (more later) but the on/off switch did not work. So I took it back and got another. Same problem, on/off switch did not work. Talk about quality control issues.Another complaint. I would prefer the old school electric plug, but they've switched to batteries. Fine. The bulb they use is smaller than a night light bulb, yet it takes 3 D size batteries to run it. Are you kidding me? I think you could light that with 1 C in 1970. Inefficient, wasteful, bad for the environment, expensive to run.Design could not be much worse. Find a 20 year old model on eBay."
2,Pegs Fly Everywhere,"While my daughter loves this the roll out compartment below is useless. Takes such force to roll it out all the pegs fly everywhere. Every. Time. Put the pegs in a separate container for your sanities sake. Plus, batteries to operate something that could easily be plugged in? And the light. There's no on/off switch. Very annoying."
2,This Lite-Brite Has No Might,"All cons (yikes!):-Smaller screen; standard-sized construction paper has to be sized, then cut(I am lazy).-Included pic sheets are slick, not matte, therefore, the pegs are ""held"" less well.-Peg holder is hard to open for tots.-Pegs are shorter in length now; even hobbit hands have trouble grasping theses pegs, then placing them in pic.-Bulb is about as bright as a firefly's glow.-Bulb action fades just as you are beginning to check out the lighted pic, bringing on disappointment and resentment.-Batteries are needed.The old-school version (very early 80's) has never been recalled. Get your butt to ebay pronto if you want bright creativity."
2,many flaws outweigh fun,"The game includes nowhere to store the black sheets for the ""screen"". The storage drawer jams every time you close it so opening it tends to result in pegs flying all over the room. You can turn the light on but not off; I seem to recall that we had on/off light technology even way back when I was a kid. The pegs don't stay in well, the blue pegs tend not to glow at all unless they're directly above the light bulb.You'd think with many generations of children to evolve and perfect this toy it would have gotten better rather than worse; your expectations would be frustrated."
3,fun,I had this when I was a kid and loved it - that is whenever we had the refill sheets. This new laptop version is nice and the case for the pegs would be nice if they didn't fly all over the room everytime you opened it.....needs some improvements
1,Lite Brite,"This Lite Brite is not this year's 'model', peg holder bin sticks too hard for young fingers to open and the on/off button is stuck in 'on' position. I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas but did not give it to her.....I was disappointed in this toy and knew she would be too. Don't know now if a refund is possible?"
3,Good enough for a kid.,"The peg compartment is an issue, but not really a big one. Life is full of moments requiring finesse, and this is one of them. I'd rather it be a little stubborn than flying open with one bump off the bed. If my kid had an artsy bone in his body, he'd love this I'm sure. Turns out he doesn't, but it makes a great Transformers nightlight!"
1,Gone Cheap,"I remember the lite-brite when I was a child and this doesn't even come close to comparing. The diagrams aren't well made, many pegs need 'filing down' to fit in the pegs. The drawer to store the pegs is very difficult to open and when you do get it open pegs go flying everywhere. I would have easily paid another $20-30 for a better product. Don't recommend."
2,"poorly made, not like the old ones","I was excited to get this for my daughters as I have very fond memories of it as a child. It is poorly made, the screen is small. The light on the red one illuminates the sides of the toy as well as the screen thus the colors are not as vibrant. It does not do that on the purple one. The worst part is the case that the pegs sit in - I thought this was a good idea, except that whenever they try to open it, the case sticks and the pegs go flying. I am still stepping on errant pegs. They used up the pages in one day, and I cannot find more."
1,Do not recommend this product.,"This product is a huge disappointment. It will not stand up, the pegs fall out of the board, the light is on an auto timer and there is no way to manually turn it off. I would not recommend this for purchase.We did a wish list at Amazon for this Christmas and will not do so again. We now have to return three of the items we purchased due to poor quality and broken pieces and due to the draconian return policies at Amazon we don't even know if they will take back the products. It is not worth it. Next year we will purchase through local retail stores. Never again, Amazon."
2,Too simple for me.,"999 was always more than just three chords. They were three chords plus some interesting tasty fills from all players. The lyrics were always funny. This album has their simplest stuff ever with hardly anything to spice up the mix. I know punk is supposed to be low budget, but this is totally off the cuff. Way too repetitive. No spark. The guys sounded much better 25 years ago. I don't know what happened to Jon Watson, but he needs to TAKEOVER the bass duties again. I hate that tinny, metallic sound. Guy, please play louder than the bass player! Credit Nick Cash who, even though he's breathless most of the time, is in there pitching. The first few cuts but are OK but the rest is lame."
3,"Don't last long, but look great","I really love the look of these bulbs on my Honda Civic. They don't really look blue, but rather very white, definitely an upgrade from the stock headlights. BUT, after only little over a year they both burned out. If they would last longer I'd rate them 5 out of 5."
3,"Look good, need to last longer though","I really like these bulbs, I just wish that they were more durable and lasted longer. One bulb burned out after only about a year and I'm just waiting for the other bulb to go out."
4,No problems yet,"I do mostly daytime driving, so I don't use my headlights very much. Nevertheless, the 9003CB has been working just fine; it matches the other headlight. Can't say I'm too impressed with them, altogether, but for the price, it's not a bad deal.Very easy to replace -- do it yourself if you want to save money. A mechanic was going to charge me $40 to replace it... I did it in about 15 minutes."
5,I CAN SEE!!!,"i only needed to replace one light on my '95 Subaru, WOW, one side projects a bright white light and the other side is the dirty tan light. Side-by-side Cool Blue is great, i now have to change the other bulb since it looks so bad. Cool Blue is even bright when i drive in winter weather when the lights are covered from road salt and dirt. If you have headlights that only look OK when no other lights are around, it's time to upgrade to Cool Blue."
1,Over-Hyped,"Despite the advertising, I would say that this book is of little or no use to all but the beginning investor who wants a very easy to manage entry/exit system. I could replicate the ""extensive historical research"" that these ""prominent authors"" have performed for their systems in less than a few days and I'm no expert.There are more pages of text devoted to the history of Fidelity and to an overview and explanation of the Select Funds (the only useful chapter in the book for me) than to the 3 ""powerful mutual fund models"". The ""computer programs"" included on disk are nothing more than incredibly simple spreadsheet templates.I'm not sure if the authors are bull-market opportunists or just naive, but their book was/is a great disappointment to me."
2,Attempts to Define Something that Isn't Definable,"I think this book will give comfort to those in the psychological community who want to explore a non-clinical pathway. Shamanism is a method for obtaining spiritual insights that are non-linear in nature. It is creative. It is challenging. For me this book attempts to structure shamanism psychologically, and that is not what the shamanic pathway is about, it limits the potential of the Work. To the seasoned journeyier this is not the book to read.If you are a psychologist who wants to expand your practice by ""doing"" shamanism without doing your own personal work so you can make more money- please take another path. If you want to explore this pathway of direct experience with the G-d of your understanding and are willing to leave your clinical training at the door, take off your psychological mask then come journey . . . and buy Michael Harner or Sandra Ingerman's book."
3,The Right Way to Read Shakespeare!,"This set is a fabulous idea for studying The Bard. Small, high-quality hardback books, with study aids. But overpriced, maybe $99.99 was a little low for this set, as it once was a few years ago. But $299 is too high for a set. Price this at $149.99, and I'll buy a set so fast, it will make your head swim! Rated 3 stars due to price, otherwise 5 stars!"
4,Good for what it is,"Nicely manufactured set, good supplemental information, easy to handle-to-handle individual volumes. Some might prefer a more comprehensive textbook a la Brevington, Norton, etc., but this is ""good for what it is""."
5,I'm Goin' Down To South Park (Part One),"Wow. This show is SO great. It is so crude and vulgar but it rules! This season contains some of my favorite ""classic"" south park episodes: ""Cartman Gets An Anal Probe"", ""Damien"", ""Death"", and ""Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo"". Also, the music videos like Cartman's O Holy Night really are classic. I'm goin' down to south park to meet some friends of mine: Cartman, Kyle, Kenny, and Stan, the third graders with a colorful vocabulary."
5,GReat,"This is what everyone of us had been waiting for so long the complete collection of seasons. Yes, I know its not a ""perfect"" dvd, it doesnt have commentary on it, etc.But when I buy a movie or a Dvd, my main concern is the main content, the reason why you bought it, to see the entire first season of the funniest cartoon show ever made.I read one article of someone really angry because it said it was a childrens show, you must have felt really stupid if you realized that this is an Mature show, for people who are MATURE."
1,No commentary? What a waste...,"If someone were to re-author the DVDs with the commentary tracks from the Comedy Central CD, I would buy them. Perhaps offer them on Rbay or something... a legal risk probably, but Warner Home Video should know better.I'd sooner pay the same amount for a re-authored set, no matter how illegal, than give one cent to Warner Home Video. I feel totally cheated, and I didn't even buy the thing. One star. Why did they even bother releasing this? Take a look at the Simpsons releases... they're in the Top Ten. They're quality products. Too bad Matt and Trey didn't stand up for their creations and hard work."
3,South Park Season 1,"South Park...what more can be said. One of the most funniest (yes this is a word) shows that I have seen in a while. So when I heard that they were releasing the complete first season, I had to have. My only regret is buying this dvd without the knowledge that Matt Stone and Trey Parker have a commentary in front of everyone of the episodes of South Park. It is rather annoying and sucks because you aren't able to skip right to the episode unless you fast forward the dvd. And what is worse, the commentaries are long, they talk about absolutly nothing, and they are hella boring. So all in all buy this dvd caution and if you are patient."
4,All Great but one thing i dont like..,"Im a great fan of south park. I own all the 3 seasons on Dvd, the only thing that i dont like is...the south park seasons on dvd have the annoying bleeps when you would see watching the tv show, those thats not really any problem still a good show, though the reason for me buying the dvd was to not have the show censored, because if that was the case, they shouldnt use those words at all."
4,It's about time,"Finally. The people in charge have finally decided to release the South Park series as every show should be: by season. Time to sell all those theme based DVDs, unless your a collector. South Park Season one episodes are:-Episode 101:Cartman Gets an Anal Probe-Episode 102:Weight Gain 4000-Episode 103:Volcano-Episode 104:Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boatride-Episode 105:An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig-Episode 106:Death-Episode 107:Pinkeye-Episode 108:Damien-Episode 109:Starvin' Marvin-Episode 110:Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo-Episode 111:Tom's Rhinoplasty-Episode 112:Mecha Striesand-Episode 113:Cartman's Mom is a Dirty SlutA very solid first season with the cliffhanger episode that [bothered most people]. The introduction if Scuzzlebutt, Big Gay Al, Pip, Starvin Marvin, Mr Hankey the Christmas Poo, and many others. I can't wait til Season 2 is released, hopefully, it won't take too long."
2,Not it's best season.,"Don't immediantly judge me based on my star rating. I've been a fan of South Park since 1997. When it came out, it was actually my favorite show. However, now that I look back on some of the older episodes, I can see the huge flaws in them.The first thing I noticed was that the humor was very differant back then. The current South Park episodes revolve around meaningful plots and have some actual good and funny jokes in them. The older episodes just use lots of bad language to try to be funny. Back in 1997, this was considered shocking and South Park immediantly became popular because of this. Then around the time period of 1999, t.v. started crossing new borders and South Park was no longer new or shocking. It was at this time when the creators changed the show to rely less on language and more on pure humor.Anyway, if you want to get a South Park DVD set, then get Season 3, not this."
5,South Park,"Nine seasons later, this is still the season with the episodes I watch the most. With the 10th season already in process, there are a number of sets and best ofs you can get. My recommendation is to steer past the best ofs if you are at all a fan or think you'll be a fan of the show. Watch a friend's season or so before buying a set. The Season 1 to 5 set is great, though costly (and sometimes not less than the individual DVD seasons). There undoubtedly will be a Season 6 to 10 set too, and it could save some money if its priced right."
2,Jesus Christ what a dissapointment,"Ok look, South Park is one of the best animated series ever. Unfortunately I can't see it on tv cause i'm from Greece! So what do I do? I buy the Dvd. WRONG!!! Why not? Cause the quality totally [stinks]!1)Episodes that are supposed to be on one dvd are on the next!2)Worst sound quality you'll ever get! Clicks and pops everywere!!3)The image is just unacceptable for an animated series.(one would expect it to be crystal clear)!!!4)13 episodes of 20 min each equals 260 min or 4 hrs and something. Too many dvd's!!!!5)The extras are of no interest! except the SP clips!!!!!Result=Don't buy it!!I don't know how the english version looks or sounds like but it can't be worst!!Save yourself trouble and money, but hey! keep watching SP cause it's out of this world!"
1,TOO LAME!!,"I think it is pathetic that both parties go at it here in the review section. I look to read customer reviews. Boycott outside of WB studios if you two have issues. I doubt there are really that many people distressed by the dvd's lack of commentary!! And NO, I DON""T WORK FOR WB OR KNOW ANYONE WHO DOES. Let consumers post the reviews!!"
2,JEFF THE JUMP HARRISSSSSSSSSSSSS,"THEY HAVE OLD VOICES which i dont find appealing and the graphics are not up to date. I'm not saying it wasn't funny but maybe because im so used to all our high-tech, i found saeson one old. Now if your a hardcore fan than go for it you'll like but if it's new to you don't."
1,Every single one of these episodes is already available,Every single one of these episodes is already avialable on DVD. Give us something new!
1,South Park: A Poor Man's Family Guy,And the problem is the downward spiral after the first season. I'd rather get my yuks watching the Love Boat.
5,Great,This is a great thing to buy. Really funny. Recommended for people over 12. A great deal. These episodes are in no order.
1,Parker and Stone make more money without doing anything new.,"This new compilation is nothing more than a reissue of their previous compilations, only in chronological order.As reported by others, there is absolutely nothing new here, and the episodes aren't broken into chapters. However, I want to add that the video quality is atrocious. I honestly think the quality is better in the broadcast versions (on non-digital cable).I'd return the set if I could, and I won't be buying Season 2 unless they - at least - improve the video quality."
5,let kids watch it it has very little sex,let kids that are 10 and up watch it now watch the old ones the new one are very bad for kids but the old one are for kids so moms and dads there you go
1,Warner Bros removed the audio commentary that was promised,"I love South Park. I own all of the DVD's already produced for the first season. I WAS going to buy this set of DVD's as well because it included a NEW audio commentary by Trey Parker and Matt Stone--the co-creators of South Park. However, that commentary has been removed by Warner Brothers, who are the distributers of the DVD Box set. They wanted to censor it, but Parker and Stone would not allow that. The audio commentary is available on a separate CD that you can get IF you pay extra (the box DVD set w/CD is 40 dollars at the CC site plus shipping and handling) or buy it here and pay extra for shipping and handling for the CD when you send proof of purchase to Comedy Central. Just remember that it's Warner Bros. fault...and let them know how you feel about, mmmkay folks? And if you buy it HERE...as you probably should...remember to send your proof of purchase to Comedy Central to get the CD that YOU ARE ENTITLED TO!"
3,Beware the bait and switch,"Apparently all the extras have been dropped. No Commentary, nor Intros. This may not be that horrible of a thing for those who just want to have all the episodes, including myself, however where is the price reduction? Commentary for the whole season is dropped yet the price tag remains at a list of 40? I don't think so. Be wary."
5,The funniest cartoon ever made,"South park is one of the funniest cartoonsever made.I now own the first season on DVD.It's awesome,no commercials.I wish they didn't beep out all the swearing.All the classic episodes are on here from Cartmangets an anal probe,Mr.Hankey the christmas poo,wellit's got them all.You can watch anyone you wantat any time.This is a must have for those who maystill have them on video cassette.The DVD is muchbetter.The first season is a must have for all thesouth park fans."
2,Cheap...,"Pretty [nice] box set for [price]. No library option for the episodes so you're stuck fast forwarding through the stupid (completely un-funny) commentary at the beginning of each episode just to get to the beginning. And forget jumping ahead to a particular scene. I love the fact that no one even proofread the box versus the discs. Got it home, popped in the disk to see my favorite episode, and the box was mislabeled! And the only good extra ""features"" are the music videos. I guess I expected a little better than this.... Maybe they should take a lesson from the Simpson's DVD Box Sets...!"
4,Good,This Season of south park is the complete first season and is pretty good but I do not like how it puts Jesus in the cartoon otherwise this is a good show it would have got 5 stars but it put Jeasus in one of the shows I am not shure if it is blafamous but I still don't like it. Otherwise this is a funny show with lots of creative episodes and lots of vulgar humor which never gets old. The weird thing is that the charcters are on construction paper so the charcters walk and look a little funny. Overall this is a good show and is pretty funny would reccomend if you like stuff on adult swim.
1,Doesn't work or broken,"Received in a timely manner however when received and attempted to view the dvd did not work. I had ordered this as I have been collecting all the seasons and wore out the first and needed a replacement, i was very disappointed that it would not play and could not figure out why but would not read on any dvd player.....very sad."
2,COMMENTARY AT COMEDY CENTRAL,"It is great to have all these episodes together in one set. However, apparently Trey and Matt's commentary was going to get edited for content. Rather than give us an edited version, they dropped the commentary from the DVDs and are offering them (unedited) on CDs through Comedy Central. See their website for more details. I saw this information at aintitcool.comSeason one has some of the greatest moments of South Park comedy. I only wish the extras had remained intact for this package deal."
4,The First Season - Because it's the first,"I can't give this DVD 5 star... Because it's not the best season of them all! And all these Episodes are allready been realesed on DVD, but having them together in chronological order is really convenient! Although they are not so good as the Simpsons... But they come close! Specialy South Parks first season is better then the Simpsons first season!! On this DVD there are not only the 13 episodes, but also some extra's like: ""A South Park Thanksgiving"" as seen on ""The Tonight Show""; Cartman ""O Holy Night"" music video; Ned ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" music video; On-Air promos; The Boys present at the 1997 CableACE Awards... The DVD contains 3 discs!! All three full of joy!! Buy it!! You'll love it!!"
3,about time,it's about time that WB is releasing the first season on DVD when in fact they've already realeased the fourth season on DVD in the UK last year. other than that South Park ROCKS! I give it a 3 stars since the DVD lacks features and was Authored very poorly.
4,Good Value,These ink cartridges work for me just as well as the much-higher-priced name brand ones. The only thing I don't do with them is print photographs because the quality isn't quite up to that standard. Otherwise . . . why pay more?
2,...,"This a disappointment from the boys , love the dust. But I think they need to go back on it themselves...Because uhm sober sevendust just doesn't seem to hold it down like the old stuff. And I'ma big supporter of growing and evolving , but I hope seasons is just a fluke and they'll come out with a better cd' next round. Enemy is a good track still though...So the two stars are for that....Hope they get back on the right track next round , I'll still buy the next album. But if it's bad too , well then I'll have to look at Sevendust in the same light as Metallica.... (Used to be good.)-The Magickal Supa Kak."
4,"Great start, great middle, okay finish","This book started out in a way that I could not put it down. It was a very interesting and well written beginning. Unfortunately, the narrative broke down a bit towards the end. I was able to predict what was happening about 100 pages before everything was explained. To me this lessens the quality of the book.However, much of the information on psychology given in the book was absolutely fascinating since I do not have any sort of background in it."
3,Already done on Star Trek!!,"This entire computer story line has been done before on the original version of Star Trek, I kept expecting they would change it, but it is almost verbatim! Would have liked more of a twist! I listened to the audio version and I could not believe how many numbers that poor person had to read out. Every time Lash picked up a file he read the client number and that was for 6 different files, all the different tests, all the different results. It was beyond tedious to listen to over and over. I think I had one of the numbers memorized by the end! When you are reading you can just skim over it, when listening you are stuck!!! I have to admit the basic premise is intriguing. The thought of a perfect match, the one person who complements you completely is fascinating. It is hard not to wonder if they person you are with would match with you in the tank!!!"
3,Great Idea...Flawed Execution,"Lincoln Child starts with an intriguing premise for what could have easily been a 5 star novel.The book starts of strong and is very gripping -- until the technology that was supposedly used to match the couples is revealed. It starts out pushing the reader's ability to suspend disbelief and things go down hill from there.The ending is obvious very early on and the book continues on longer after the ""secret"" is revealed.I checked it out the library and I would recommend the same for any Lincoln Child fan. It's worth a read, but not a purchase."
4,COMPUTER CUPID,"AT THE RISK OF BEING REDUNDANT, I find myself sharing the views of several other reviewers: it starts out great, but the last third is so bogged down in technical mumbo jumbo, and it seems as if Child fixed everything to make sense. Too bad, because for a while, we have a real pageturner going here. While I hadn't totally picked the real killer, the revelation is no surprise, considering the direction Childs is taking us in. Christopher Lash is an interesting hero, but his immediate love for his perfect match, Diana Mirren, comes out of nowhere; how come he doesn't fall for the lovely if offish Tara? And we could have done without the lengthy chase scene through the buildings tunnels or whatever they were. Richard Silver, the owner of Eden, is like most of the megalomaniacs in books like this, so his fate is likewise telegraphed.All in all, DEATH MATCH is a fun book, but it's overly technical climax is detrimental in the long run."
2,Not his best work,"This rates lower than it would if it were written by another author, because I've come to expect great things from Lincoln Child - either writing alone, or with Preston. And while this book really drew me in to begin with, it got a little stagnant towards the middle. And the end was entirely predictable. It was an interesting plot, but there wasn't enough of a twist to keep it interesting, and I'd say that if you read a lot, it's probably worth it. But if you're only going to read a handful of books this year, I wouldn't recommend it. It was just okay.I'd strongly recommend you check out his other works."
2,"cool premise, ""blah"" book","Now that I've read both Preston and Child as singular authors and coauthors, I now know Preston seems to be the backbone to Preston/Child's collaborative works. With ""Death Match"", Child developed an intriguing premise but failed to execute the story. Despite the promising premise, the story was actually BORING. It was slow-moving, the characters were ""eh"", and the end was predictable. It's unfortunate Child didn't have the insight to insert more conspiracy and intrigue, for the ""long-awaited"" answer to the deaths ended up being disappointingly simple and obvious. Hopefully Child's ""Utopia"" proves to be a more interesting read."
5,Good entertainment!,"I got this book after reading a previous book by Lincoln Child, ""Utopia"", which I liked very much. I wasn't disappointed although I have to say that ""Utopia"" was better. This book makes for a very easy, fast paced, page turning, read. One could argue that characters are not very developed but this somehow doesn't spoil the fun. I don't agree with some of the reviewers that reffered to this novel as sci-fiction - just having non-existing company and non-existing computer with unusual powers dowsn't qualify for sci-fiction. So you shouldn't expect here all the other qualities that come with sic-fi territory. The novel is not without shortcomings. I pretty much knew the gist of the ending long before the end. Some of the points that are related to the artificial intelligence and the computer that is part of this story are argumentative (but not utter ridiculous, as in some other works of similar genre). Still, I would recommend the book as a very good entertainment."
2,Must be meant for computer types.,"This story started out fine. I was ready for a murder thriller. But by the end, it simply turned into what resembled a computer manual. I also didn't care for the narrator in tne downloaded ebook version. He sounded eerily computer-generated."
2,"Great Premise, Flat Ending","The premise was great. The writing in the early part was absorbing. I was hoping against hope the ending would be different. But it became the boring, flat ending I was afraid of.As to Eden, while the premise of an all-knowing computer was intriguing, the extent to which it was pushed, & for a purpose like match-making, made it rather implausible, if not laughable. It is conceivable a computer can hack into that much data. It is rather dubious it can do that a million times without anybody detecting anything.Would have preferred if the novel had taken another direction, like, how all the information in the world still can't predict a perfect match...a little misinterpretation can ruin all the hard data..."
4,A lot of research,Very well written and goes into much detail so you know the author has done a lot of research. You hate to put it down as you never know what will happen. Amazon.com carries amazing reads.
5,Excellent read!,"I downloading this book to my kindle just biding my time til the next Pendergast book comes out; but, I have to say that once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. Enjoyable read from start to finish."
3,Fun Formulaic Thriller,"The first 2/3s of this book is great. Unfortunately, the last 1/3 degenerates into a bad episode of Captain Kirk on Star Trek battling a computer with illogic."
3,First disappointing Lincoln Child book,"I've read several books by Lincoln Child (with and without Douglas Preston), but this was my first disappointment. It isn't that the story doesn't move well, it does. The protagonist wasn't dumb, but he was a bit too.....slow. I don't want to spoil the story for someone else, but I realized what was going on way before Chapter 57, when the main character finally finds out.The idea that someone's life can be so transparent (and manipulated) by digital media is frighteningly real. It's a good story, I just like the protagonist to figure out what's going on before--or at least at the same time--as I do."
4,"A tad predictable, but very enjoyable","I'm a big fan of Lincoln Child (and Douglas Preston), and I rank Death Match among Child's better work. I think the only thing that really brought this book down from five stars to four was that Child's premise left the book rather predictable in terms of ""who dunnit"", and the ""how"" was not quite up to the standards of some of his other work (particularly with Preston).However, the book was a very enjoyable read. Anyone who enjoys the type of books written by Child and Preston should definitely check this one out."
3,"OKAY, BUT....","I am an avid fan and follower of Lincoln Child and Douglas Preston's works. I have all books, even the obscure ones, but this latest I put at the end of the shelf. If you are a 'puter techie and know all the jargon you will LOVE this book. Being only elementary level on that knowledge I had to skip over the ""tech talk"" and stick to the character plot. It was good - it was excellent in Child's own imaginary way --- but not up to his usual. I am looking forward to their new one, Brimstone, in August - but this one was only so so if you have read the rest. Still - if you are a collector --- BUY IT!"
4,Stunning,"I was a little skeptical about this book after reading the works of Preston & Child together I wondered about how Lincoln Child would write to compared to his other stuff when writing with a partner.I got such a surprise at this simply brillant thriller that kept me up for nights and sometimes days and the pages turning. The thriller was endless and although nearering the end I had the story figured out, the chase was marvelous and it is a joy to read.Lincoln Child's use of language and description was simple yet imagative and the mystery keeps evolving into new and different heights. It is one of the best books I've read in 2007."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I was very entertained throughout the novel, however I do agree with the others about the predictable ending. Still very good and worth your time."
5,Awesome Filter,"Built like OEM with a metal ""frame"" - necessary feature when the engine is at high end RPM so the filter edges don't get sucked in when it begins to get restricted!"
2,Iguana Information,"Upon reading this book I found a lot of interesting facts about Iguana's, but at the same time I found the book to be severly outdated and full of facts that were less important than care and feeding of your new Iguana. Would recommend a newer book!"
3,"It cuts well. But, has lost some teeth.","This blade cuts very well when new. The teeth are ""medium-course"" which means that they will cut wood aggressively but will not always leave a neat, clean cut. When cutting against the grain, your cut will sometimes be a little rough and splintered (that's typical with any such blade, not just this one). I have used this blade to cut 1x2's, 2x2's, 2x4's, plywood and tree limbs. It has lost several teeth (blade still worked). I never abused this blade. So I must assume that the teeth simply broke off during use. Maybe I hit a few nails? Recently the blade became stuck while I was sawing aggressivly. The blade bent badly. Even after trying to fix it, it just wasn't the same anymore. I will admit that I got a fair amount of use out of this saw blade. But, I am thinking that it should have lasted a little longer."
1,Ace Hardware - GOOD / Sharksaw replacement blade - NOT GOOD,"I had a good experience with Ace Hardware - they tried to make this right. The issue I had was with the Sharksaw replacement blade. My original blade had a ""replacement blade"" number on it, and that is what I ordered. When I got it it wouldn't fit into the handle. Ace was kind enough to send me another blade, but it didn't fit either. I think that the Sharksaw company may have made a slight adjustment in the design of the handle since mine was made, and as a result the replacements ALMOST but don't quite fit."
5,Fell a thrill of a century,"Have you ever read Edgar Allan Poe ? If no, this book deserve a place in your shelf. If yes, do not miss this chance to read his stories. First of all, remember that his own reality was like a nightmare, with a woman murdered, poverty and sadness ... His soul belonged to the silence of the night and his stories create a world where a wall could be the end of a life, where a monster jumps from roof to roof, or, even, beautiful teeth could mean a nail in your coffin ... Do not miss this one, Paulo Sunao Shintate Jr."
4,"Great words, not so great formatting","I'm a big fan of Poe, so I always like to take a look at editions I've not seen before. This is quite a good one, but the formatting of this ebook lets it down. The Table Of Contents is hit and miss, some links work and others don't. The stories themselves are well presented, however."
2,table of contents does not work,table of contents is not there on my kindle as advertised. poe is anamzing author but his body of work is unmanagable on my kindle and therefore nearly useless. i do not have the patience to page through literally thousands of pages. disappointing useless waste of time and money.
5,"Poe, the man, the myth the genius","I looked all over the internet for a better hardcover, for a book that not ridiculously huge or have incorrect margins making it almost impossible to read. For the most avid of fanatics to this wonderful author you can not find a more well put together book than this fine piece of American literature. The farther i dived into this book i truely have a better understanding of a complex man that not only can scare your wits in the twenty first century, but also has humor and satire that the likes of which i did not know existed. A well priced investment for any home library (in which the books are actually read that is)."
5,Awesome,Received this book in great condition. All the info that I was looking for when reviewing the book was in the discription. GREAT
2,Poems?,"The book is a good compilation, aside from one important thing which is not a part of title but mentioned in the review:POEMS!I specially bought this one for it claims:""This single volume brings together all of Poe's stories and poems [. . .]""That felt really bad when I realize this one only contains the short stories, well though some short stories contain some of the poems, a few but in the review, again I highlight they say ""all of Poe's stories and POEMS""!Hope they add the poems soon or I'll get to contact with Amazon customer service."
2,Reading Poe,"Edgar Allen Poe needs to be read with a thesaurus handy. Apart from the stilted vocabulary and long descriptions, murderous plots emerge.Purchased at Amazon."
4,"Fairly priced, but lacks illustrations","Not being a literary expert, I take the publishers at theirword that this thick volume contains all Poe's stores and poems.Nobody with any fondness for literature should be unacquainted with Poe. Personally, after all these years I'm delighted to have thiscompilation of his work in a single hard-cover volume at an very affordable price. My only wish is that a few expertly drawnillustrations accompanied some of the stories. Those thatshare this desire should seek other, illustrated, editions of Poe's work."
2,Tales of Edgar Allen Poe,"I love Poe's writing, but this book is in the original ""olde"" English and is very difficult to read for me. So I am really not too happy with this particular version. I should have read the ""small print"".ascott"
5,good !,ok Edgar Allen Poe is a good writter no doubt and his stuff is good to read so take my advice buy it and you wont be disapointed k....
3,Book review,"Bought this as a gift for my brother. He was very excited to receive the book and apparently loves it. However, I was disappointed in the shipment of the book. The packing was bad enough that when I opened it up, the corner of the book was bent and the book jacket was torn up on the corner. This was the only aspect of the book that I wasn't happy with."
5,One of the best authors in history,"Alan Poe is one of my favorites terror authors, and he is very good at it. Some tales will make you imagine the most scary situations, while others will amaze you because of the use of logic.I have just read a some tales and a few poems, and i can't wait to read them all."
4,E.A.P.,"The complete stories and poems of Edgar Allan Poe is a nice book to have around. A lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that's good news... more Poe to read!"
3,Troublesome Replacement Battery,"We only gave the Panasonic Cordless Phone Replacement Battery an average rating because it had to be replaced twice. The first replacement battery was difficult to install in the phone (mfgr quality control issue??), took hours to charge, then would only hold charge for less than 3 minutes before the phone went dark. Thanks to prompt seller response, we received another replacement battery. It installed very easily & although it took quite long to charge, it seems to be holding up well."
2,Don't like it for Pop Goes The Weasel,"I think that 3rd Bass really came off their lamest on this album. Most of the album has uninspired beats, and they're so obsessed with attacking the more commercial rap artists. The worst offense is the lame Pop Goes The Weasel, where they attack Vanilla Ice and his To The Extreme's multiplatinum success. What's even contradicting is that the group's rapping over a pop song in Peter Gabriel's Sledgehammer. The music sounds like some broken food mixer when the parts can't spin and the screws are fallin apart in the mixing bowl. The rest of the album is nowhere as exciting as that solid 1989 debut. The New York producers on that album come up with such pointless stuff, MC Serch comes off as arrogant, while Pete Nice sounds disconnected with his partner on the songs."
4,Hip Hop rapping good time!,"I first got this album on a cassette tape and I played it out. It rocks. The beats are infectious and the rapping is awesome. Pete Nice and MC Search are like two peas in a pod. They work really well together and it shows in this thumping classics. I love when they bring in other rappers to groove with them. It is an amazing album, some of the language isn't so great but it is a lot better than the stuff that you see out here today. A definite score!"
1,This Sucks! -It's Hipocracy at it's Finiest!,"It's funny how ignorant some people can be sometimes. Artists sell music with ""explicit Lyrics"" tag on the cover of the CD and yes, they are talking about fighting, killing, taking other guys' girlfriends and doing sexual things to her and what they are going to do to women... Ect... It's ok with me (I guess). But when you take the same songs with exact lyrics and bring ""kids"" to the studio and have them record over it with their voices, hmmm well, I have an issue with that.That only shows how stupid the world has become. And in my case, it's not about that, It's the fact that there are people out there trying to protect kids and keep them away from these type of music and lyrics. But yet this crap comes out. How would you like your 8 year old singing about violence, sex and drugs???[...]"
5,REST IN PIECE SIR TONY,"REST IN PIECE SIR TONY, DIRECTOR OF TRUE ROMANCE. HOLLYWOOD HAS LOST A TRUE GENIUS OF A FILMMAKER. SO PROUD TO BE A FAN AND TO OWN ALL HIS FILMS."
5,These aren't my clothes...,"When friends come over for movie night, the first thing I always ask them is; have you ever seen 'True Romance'? It is always my first pick out of the 1100 movies I own, when company comes. It is Tony Scott's masterpiece, and the best thing Quentin ever wrote. Over the top, way way violent, and unforgettable performances by a star-studded cast. So many memorable lines to add to the pop culture. And am still amazed at how unknown this film is to movie fans! Tony Scott will always be remembered as a high octane film maker. One who could make sense out of the kinetic editing process, to give us many thrills. Thanks for the wild ride Tony, may you rest in peace."
3,"good film making, old idea","The actual camera work and acting in this film is well done. it is entertaining, however not very original. this movie is much too similar to Terrence Mallicks Badlands. The score is exactly the same. If you are going to re-make a film, make it better. The problem I have with Terrentino, is he borrowes ideas and does not change them. it is one thing to borrow ideas, but at least use them to accent your own style. He has done nothing that really sets him apart from others. The films he has made have all been done, and done better i might add. His trade marks were all stolen from earlier film makers. this film is over rated, however it should be enjoyed if you are purely looking to be entertained."
2,Don't buy this yet,"There is a unrated special edition coming in september of 2002, so you might want hold off on getting this now. I don't know the specs or special features but it has to be better the the bare bones disk."
2,"great list of actors, but poor script","Can't believe how many great actors are in this film, Brad Pitt, Patricia Arquette, Tom Sizemore,Christian Slater, etc. etc. However, the story and dialog is poorly written. Slater's character goes from being a comic book store salesman to a premeditated killer/defender of call girls in one night (who happens to keep a loaded gun at home, really?). The story line was slow. The best part was Patricia Arquette's performance as ""Alabama"" the call girl. She is a tough girl whose beautiful face and figure are not hardly damaged after a violent assault scene by one of the bad guys.I guess she wouldn't have been so sexy and cute if they made her realistically look beaten up. Maybe she's just tough like Superman. The best part of the movie was the last 5 minutes. Twist turner ending, and the fact that it WAS the end. Rate this as a 2 out of 5 stars. Sorry I bought this as a gift for the hubby."
4,True Romance,"for such an old film,the picture is prestine but as far as audio goes it's not there ( due to how movie was originally recorded.not much action goes on in the surround speakers"
4,This Movie Is the Shhhhhhhhht!!!!,"Well written!! Well executed!! Well acted!! Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, transcend in this tell of love gone awry!! Brad Pitts debut!! Story of Love, Prostitutes, Pimps, Drugs, Organized Crime, Unorganized Crime, and Law Enforcement!! After seeing this movie and death by toilet, you'll never be the same!!"
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:While no one will acuse True Romance of being art, it brings a well-balanced mixture of Tarantino-speak and violence to the table and delivers an entertaining package; scenes like the one in which James Gandolfini stops trying to murder Patricia Arquette in order to talk about the nature of killing or when Bronson Pynchot gets caught with drugs alone justify spending time/money on the film."
4,What would you do for love?,"Christian Slater is a timid guy who works at a comic book store who is set up with a birthday rookie-prostitute played by Rosanna Arquette. The couple fall head over heels for each other & in an attempt to free his new love from her pimp played by Gary Oldman a brutal, blood splattered & bullet riddled high speed intensity adventure ensues. All star cast of great performances from Christopher Walken-James Gandolfini-Dennis Hopper-Val Kilmer-Brad Pitt"
1,It's not a comedy. It's not interesting either.,"It's not a comedy. Therefore, the plot does not make sense with all the killings. It's not interesting either."
1,This sucks!!,The movie was so filled with filthy words that we turned it off after about 20 minutes.What a waste of money!!
2,Inaccurate order,This was supposed to be a 2-disc set that includes the director's cut. But instead I received 2 if the feature presentation (2 of Disc 1). I was pretty frustrated
1,true romance,This dvd was in the wrong format so I will have to travel to south africa in order to watch it. I checked out flights and they are 1600 bucks round trip from Denver so I will probably just buy another dvd sometime from a more reputible seller.
5,Great seller!,"Good Sale. Came quickly in the mail, DVD worked and was like new as described. All around easy and efficient. Great seller!"
5,"Great Story, Great Acting, Great Dvd Edition",You must know what this movie is about from all the other reviewers so i'll just coment on this dvd. The quality of this dvd is excellent. Great sound and visual. Many extras. It's very much worth the price. Quentin Tarantino wrote the script and Tony Scott directed it. Do I dare say it is a masterpiece? It is to me. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give oscar worthy performances. I love it!!
5,WOW!,"Christian Slater, Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, Val Kilmer, Patricia Arquette, Gary Oldman, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn, Michael Rappaport, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Bronson Pinchot, Ed Laughter, Sal Rubinek, my God what a cast! This is a great movie! It has also adged very well considering that it's practically a decade old already! This movie will satisfy fans of Tarantino and those who aren't! Amazing, amazing, amazing! This WILL be the best money you ever spend on a DVD, not to mention the gretest DVD in your collection! BUY THIS TODAY!"
5,best taranino,"he's a better writer than ever. better than pulp fiction, reservoir dogs, set all - combined! you will not be disappointed"
5,Don't miss this one!,"I, like most people do not remember this when it came out in theaters. I caught it on cable late one night and was blown away. I ran out and got the 2 disc DVD Unrated/Director's cut right away.How a star studded action movie like this slipped through the cracks, I don't know. But do yourself a favor and DON'T MISS THIS ONE!Contrary to others, I think the DVD's extra's are fantastic. Well worth the money."
4,Strange name great gangster movie,"This is a very under-rated flick, this is around the time people thought Slater was the next Nicholson(?). Anyway good movie on both sides of the fence girls will like the love story and guys will love the mobster drug dealing story (even got James Gandolfini in it!) Good movie all around."
3,"Great movie, so-so Blu-ray","The picture on the Blu-ray edition is soft and flat compared to many recent movies. That might just be the way this movie looks (I didn't see it in the theater), but don't expect to be dazzled by the PQ on this BD. The movie itself is great, with an unbelievable cast, clever dialogue and memorable characters (particularly Gary Oldman's). If you don't already own the DVD, this Blu-ray edition is highly recommended. If you're considering a double dip, though, you might want to rent it first or check some reviews."
2,Tarantino and a cast of thousands,"Tarantino writes the script. And everyone and their mothers are in this movie. The casting must have cost half the budget. (One wonders why Steve Buscemi wasn't in on this one.) However, the casting and the script are pretty much the only reasons to watch this movie, which is about forty-five minutes too long for its plot. Christian Slater and his unknowing wife (Patricia Arquette) steal half a million dollars' worth of cocaine from a very nasty pimp/dealer (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman, playing as great a bad guy as he did in The Professional) and head for Cali to sell it. Could've been a high-powered action flick (the theft), could have been a good road movie (getting to Cali), could have been another good high-powered action flick (trying to sell the drugs to a hysterically funny Bronson Pinchot), but when the director attempted to glue the pieces together, everything came out flat. For Tarantino completists."
1,TRUE ROMANCE,"THE DVD IS NOT MARKED TO PLAY IN CERTAIN AREAS AND THE DVD DOES NOT WORK, WE HAVE TRIED IT IN 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT PLAYERS THAT WORK NOW JUST FINE WITH OTHER DVDS. WE CONTACTED THEM BACK AND THE PAPERWORK WAS SO LENGHTY THAT WE SAID IT IS NOT WORTH IT. I GUESS WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT MUCH FOR THE CHEAP PRICE BUT WE GOT EXACTLY WHAT WE PAID FOR. WE ARE NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THE PROCESS, AGAIN WE ONLY PAID $6 WITH SHIPPING."
2,A title for my review,"This is the best film ever made by Tony Scott. Actually this ain`t much of a special film but it helped to launch Tarantinos career. His trademark , this so called ""machine-gun-dialogue"", just didn`t got the kick at this point."
1,Missing disc 2,"I ordered this for a friend. It had two Disc ones and no disc two! Sent it back, got another one with the same problem!"
1,Check what region your in....,Love the movie and wanted it in my collection but it came from England and wouldn't play in my DVD player.
4,True Romance,Item was received in excellent condition and within time indicated.Packaging was in excellent condition as was both CD's. I would do business again with this shipper.
4,True Romantic,"If you don't get it, don't see it again. For me, it rests in my dust free enclosed shelf case beside my other prized DVD collectibles (I have watched these films many times over.)This film would have gotten 5 stars if QT had directed it. Much of the hard to quantify QT intuitive energy and pacing is missing. But Scott delivered in spades because the dialogue sets the pace, and I really like his choice of the ending. It made the gritty fairy tale romance complete for me. I totally bought Patricia Arquette's Alabama (she is the heart and soul of this film, ..."
3,"Pretty good...weird, extremely violent, Christian Slater...","This is pretty messed up. There are a few scenes that were so violent I curled up into a ball and cried for hours before unpausing the movie. Overall, it's a good piece of cinema (if you can stand Christian Slater's constant Jack Nicholson impression) from Quentin Tarantino (he wrote it, but didn't direct). Some dialogue that would later pop up in PULP FICTION, but that's ok."
5,GREAT TARANTINO MOVIE,"If you like Tarantino movies, I think you would enjoy this one. Of course, the obligatory violence....but also the great dialogue. There is a memorable scene with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken.....Awesome! Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are very credible, and perform their roles beautifully. Give it a go!"
5,A mostly unknown classic...,"Tarantino's first screenplay, and a ridiculouis roster of stars and great actors...This is a gem of a movie, because it hasso many scenes of black humor, and intense, gratuitous violence and indulgence...With an undertone of bizzare romance, and Tarantino-esque fantasy..."
5,Classic,One of my favorite movies of all time. Imagine if QT directed it.... A must see. Word word word word
4,Good-not so clean fun,Excellent movie- surprised to see Brad Pitt play such a small part but he was funny. I'd like to see him in the role of Dante in Jennifer MacDonald's book-Evolution.
4,ELVIS is KING,"Although directed by Tony Scott this is definitley a Quentin Tarantino movie. Lots of action and dark humor plus the ""mexican standoff"", great movie. Brad Pitt is hilarious."
4,Why the Directors Cut is A Far Better Movie...........,"I saw this DVD @ a friends home. I wore two VHS tapes out of this movie....and this was after taping them onto blank tapes, so as not to ruin the originals. This movie, along with Natural Born Killers, are my favorite bedtime movies. I would love to buy the directors cut of this DVD, but will not by one until I see it. I must admit, I am intrigued at the thought of seeing it letterboxed. Please get a letterboxed directors cut in so I can buy it from you. ""You see, he bought this ring for his sweetheart. He wears it on a chain around his neck until this dirty Kraut rips it off and it falls into the sea...He dives in after it....isn't that cool?"""
5,guilty pleasure,"When Tony scott(TOP GUN,THE FAN,CRIMSONE TIDE)teams up with theinfamous Qeuntin Tarantino(PULP FICTION,RESERVOIR DOGS)what badthings can happen.This is in my favorites of the Tarantino collection with outstanding performances by Christian Slater(MOBSTERSBROKEN ARROW)and the hot Patricia Arqeutte.Also a great ensembleincluding Dennis Hopper,Gary Oldman,Christopher Walken,Chris Penn,Tom Sizemore,Samuel L. Jackson,and Val Kilmer as the ghost ofElvis.Full of gunplay,strong violence,sex,drugs,and the TarantinoDialogue we all love which is ...everything.Not as good as Tarantino's single stuff like PULP or RESERVOIR but not to far back."
5,True Romance,"Penned by Quentin Tarantino, Scott's cheeky, hyper-violent ""Romance"" flippantly references movies like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Badlands,"" but manages to leave its own crazed, amped-up stamp on the lovers-on-the-run genre. Slater and the foxy Arquette are perfectly matched, her Jessica Lange-ish moll playing well off his cheerily smug, gun-toting clerk. Scott's ace in the hole, apart from Tarantino's ballistic script, is his gallery of supporting actors: Oldman's dreadlocked pimp, Brad Pitt's hilariously clueless stoner, and Christopher Walken's ice-cold mobster are all a hoot to watch. ""Romance"" is a stylish, high-octane thriller like no other."
1,WORST. TRANSFER. EVER.,"Folks,As an avid consumer of blu ray, I'm growing sick to death of studios releasing god-awful transfers of favorite films. This transfer of True Romance is an abomination. It's so dark you can barely see anything. Somebody should be fired over this."
4,25 Word Or Less Review,"Raucus but truly dumb action/romance/comedy that makes for a wild ride. Garth Ennis fans will notice how much that Brit ""borrowed"" from Tarantino."
4,A KICK A$$ MOVIE! very violent though,"nothing can describe this movie other than as a kick a$$ film. It is cool, hip and fun to watch. Although some parts are very violent it is still very entertaining. Written by Quinton Tarantino (pulp fiction, jakie brown, resevuiar dogs) it is even beter. The story starts out with Christian Slatter (Very bad things) and Patricia Arquette (flirting with disaster, A nightmare on Elm ST part 3) as the love bug couple. OH its a nice quiet film untill Christian slatter desides to mess with Alabama's (partricia arquette)former pimp Gary oldman. Boy that makes a mess of things! also with Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt, Chrispher Walken and Samuel L. Jackson this movie awsome to watch! Directed by Tony scott this movie a masterpiece. the only thing that did make me a little puzzled about this film was one scene where Patricia Arquette was violently getting beat up. Rated R for Strong violence, lauguge and some sexuality this movie deserves 4 stars!--dillhead005"
4,Good and gory,"Recommended by husband's coworker. Played well through WII on TV. Movie is quintessential Tarentino. Harsh language, bloody, lil' racist, violent, movie-music-celebrity obsession and rough. Makes one think something happened to that guy as a kid that he'll never get over."
4,Not for the squeemish,"A delightful modern odyssey, if you can tolerate periodic over-the-top scenes of violence. Terrific and extensive cast bring to life a dazzling array of characters. Memorable music score. And, our hero and heroine make it through in one piece."
4,True Romance,This is a great old movie. haven't seen it in a while and wanted to have a movie night. Ordered it got it loved it. Thanks
5,Great Movie!,"outstanding! a typical, and one of the best Tarantino screen plays... Tony Scott does a great job of directing. Acting is superb."
4,"Written by tarantino, b4 he was bigtime","This one of my favorites. Includes brad pitt b4 he was famous, small role but played it perfectly. All star cast, each perfect for the part. Lots of cussing, blood and action but has mellow moments also. Today i consider this movie nostalgic in a very good way."
2,Truly Romanced,"This movie is my all time favorite for no other reason than Tony Scott directing a Quentin Tarantino written script. The DVD is great... if you read the fine print. I purchased, by accident and my fault, a Region 2 DVD. What does that mean? I means only Region 2 players can display it. Where's Region 2, you ask? Ah, well... that would be Europe. I live in the USA which is Region 1. So it was my bad, but still wish a more active effort was displayed by the vendor to illustrate it was not a compatible DVD. Those are the breaks! I should've read closely, or at least wonder why it was so cheap.Caveat emptor! [Latin ~ beware the buyer]I felt I truly was romanced into purchasing."
3,"boy, tony scott really wiped his ass with this one...","the only reason why we watched this was bc tarantino wrote it. the ending was horrible. it didn't even flow with the rest of the film. clarance should have died when the audience thought he was dead and alabama should have left with the briefcase. end of story. what's with the oh-so-happy ending? and a kid? really? how cheap. even more disappointing was the fact that tarantino's cameo was cut out. he's a true auteur and tony scott totally took a big crap on this. if you're a fan of tarantino, watch this, however, don't expect too much.3/5"
2,No Dice.,"I must admit I'm not a Tarantino fan, and movie buffs mostly aren't. He gets it wrong again and again. It's arrogance at work disguised as an adventure. He's obviously prejudiced(your Sicilian slept around, The Compton schmeel in Res. Dogs), ect. The close-ups of the actors, again and again. Yes, I know they are pretty/cute/important, but just because the director says someone is outta sight, doesn't make it so. Oh, and how can I forget the rambling. On and on about whatever just as long as it doesn't make sense. Like discussing a drug deal on a roller coaster. This is supposed to make Christian Slater hiper than hip, but let's face it. Anyone buying 200,000 dollars worth of cocaine should be able to handle a roller coaster, right? I'm glad he hasen't put out any movies recently so people can get back to what a good movie should be like, such as ""Trees Lounge"" or ""The Fellowship of the Ring."""
1,TARRENTINO IS NOT THE TALENT TEENAGERS IN THEIR 20's THINK,"Could have been a good movie, if tarentino's ego were kept under wraps. He inserts himself into everything and HIS actual life is terribly boring. Tarentino's films are universally and fundamentally boring for anyone who has ever lived a real life and not just fantasized about having one. His dipictions of violence eminate from his own personal lack of sexual energy. Sadly, teenage males without girlfriends seem to like these slammed together video games that are being called brilliant, and continue to support the trash factory that generates this type of hyper garbage. It's especially sad when a true film afficienado understands the brilliance of all of the original pictures which he doggedly ripped off and claimed the scenes for his own. If one more person calls this sad, pathetic, lack of a man a genious, I will become even more sick of him. Please get a life and buy a real movie."
3,Hard to use,"This program is not compatabile with many instruments. It is based mainly on certain instruments, therefore it only works on five out of twenty people"
1,Musicwrite by Voyetra is incomprehensible,"This is impossibly difficult to navigate, and many instructions in the help file, even when followed meticulously, don't work. There is no paper guide to the program; I found it totally useless and a waste of time... and money. Into the round file with it."
2,I dont get what the big deal is...,"This sounds like something youd hear out of a nursery! This music has no redeeming values at all. Even if it was, it would be innapropreate for the children. If im right, fraire a' jaques means ""come and sleep with me"". That might be moulin rouge though. Honestly (COMMMENSE AND WE WILL DEFEAT THE QUINTON-TOES EMPIRE!) honk honk bussy be have your hunny swee, this song is the the only good one on the album"
2,"Obnoxious, Unfortunately","We are Veggie Fanatics at our house and we bought this CD after getting ""O Veggie Where Art Thou?"" [which is just AWESOME!]. Unfortunately, my husband and I found this CD horribly annoying. The songs are pretty terrible, including hideously obnoxious renditions of ""This Little Light of Mine"" and ""My God is so Big""... We've never bought a Veggie product we didn't love, but we don't love this one and wish we hadn't gotten it. The children, however, really like it - which means I've got these awful versions of these old songs that I love stuck in my head constantly! :)So, I recommend that you go buy ""O Veggie Where Art Thou?"" or some other fabulous Veggie product and skip this one."
5,Great CD,"My kids love this! They won't put anything else on while we're in the car. If you want some catchy tunes to help your children understand basic Bible stories and values, this is the CD for you!"
2,Lacking in many ways.,"While this book is informative, it is in no way a good reference guide in preparing for the exam. The author fails to deliver many key areas that are essential for the exam. Also, the test questions are not good enough to get you prepared for the exam.I was forced to use the SUN manual for this exam i.e. SA-387. The book also contains many errors, too much errors for a book of this kind.Be warned. If you plan to use this book, make sure that you have allot of hands on experience with Solaris and also make sure that you have a good reference guide to back it up.The verdict, this book is a good paper weight."
4,Good review book with lots of examples,"Covered are TCP/IP protocol concepts, client-server ports and sockets, routing, DHCP, SNMP, DNS, and IPv6.The book has lots of examples and output, which are well-explained. At the end of the book are summary and prep tips, a sample exam, and answers."
4,Got The Job Done,"I used this book as my primary study reference and passed. Overall, I found this study guide useful, accurate, and reasonably complete, although the answers to the questions at the end of each chapter were incomplete.As always, it helps to combine practice exams with study material. The practice exams on the CD were OK, although I thought the Boson tests were better.If you are going after your Solaris 8 certs, it'll get the job done."
1,Insufficient detail to pass the exam,This book contains material that is just too simple to allow you to pass the exam.[...].
3,"Fair movie,the real star is Wynton Marsalis's soundtrack","The movie is a bit of a mess, hard to follow at times, hard to know when to laugh, or if we are laughing, should we be?Peter Falk stars as a 1950's script writer for a New Orleans radio station's soap operas. Apparently he dislikes Albanians and allows his radio soap operas to take strange detours into jokes at the expense of Albanians.The movie also has a movie within a movie involving a romance between 36-year old Barbara Hershey and 21-years young Keanu Reeves.The real star of the movie is the city of New Orleans and the amazing soundtrack of Wynton Marsalis. He really did a hell of a job with his compositions, but hey the guy is from New Orleans -- who better to set loose to write a soundtrack about his home city."
2,I wanted to like this movie...,"I wanted to like this movie but did not.The whole movie required too much suspension of disbelief for me. While there were a few interesting moments, for the most part, the movie did not deliver. Though Barbara Hershey was easy on the eyes and Peter Falk did his usual thing, the movie was far from being zany and hilarious as advertised. Rent or borrow before buying."
1,Talent Wasted...,Wow! What am amazing waste of time and money. This movie is awfull. There is a reason it only made $2 million. The only people who saw it were the extra's and their families so they could point themselves out in the film.
1,Boring!,"The reviews of this movie were so good that I bought it.What a mistake.Don't buy it, rent it if you want to waste 2 hours of your time."
3,A period piece,"This is a film that was cut a bit too tightly, and it shows at times. It's a great Peter Falk venue to show off his ability to be truly absurd, but the love story between the leads is far less interesting than the cast of characters that Falk's character creates and personally portrays as a crazy soap opera writer in the fading glory days of radio.Theres also some subtle bits to watch for from the rest of the cast, but Falk's character has a tendency to bulldoze them aside horribly from importance as the great manipulator of events."
3,Keanu and Mario,"Mario Vargas Llosa's autobiographical novel gets an American treatment, with Keanu Reeves playing the naive hero, and able seconding by seasoned actors. Comic, but in a strange way."
4,Early Bette Davis at her Typical Best!,"Being a Bette Davis fan, I was surprised that I had overlooked this gem! In it, you will find all the qualities and nuances of Bette's acting style that bear her trademark moves--such as her clipped phrases and wide-eyed blinking frenzies. The director didn't strip her of any of these traits that we have come to love and expect of Miss Davis.In this film, she plays a ""hostess"" in a gangster's nightclub. The costumes that she and the rest of the female cast wear are amazing and are sure to delight fans of period 30's outfits and flashy clothes.Bogart plays a role that is atypical for him in this movie, and pulls it off with ease. In fact, all the actors do a superb job, and though there are elements of camp to this film, it does a fine job of portraying the true-life overturning of Lucky Luciano's gangland empire. See this film if you are a fan of Warner's gangster period or craving Bette's familiar set-chewing swagger."
5,"Bette, Bette, Bette","This is one of the most leading lady of all times. Her style, looks and the way she is, no one can top her, in today's world. A classic and beyond."
4,Three girls from Oaktown,"This is a nice CD full of funky grooves and smooth vocals - Mercury didn't push or support it, but it contains lots of hooks and soaring harmonies from three cute, nice girls from Oakland - mostly produced by Toni Tony Tone's Dwayne Wiggins - pick this one up in the bins, you'll thank me."
5,I Used To Listen To This All The Time,"I just couldn't stop. I like ""Bumping Up And Down"". Try hearing it without it sticking in your head for the rest of the day."
5,down by the bay,Down by the bay is a funny song and my teacher mrs. schneider has the whole song and the book and Really funny funny funny my mother say did you ever see a rhino kissing a dino down by the bay and really ever good
5,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful","This album is amazing--still today. I ""discovered"" Raffi as a 30-something mother, and am thrilled. Some of the songs I knew from childhood, some are new to me, and all are completely delightful. Raffi's voice is warm and steady. The simple accompaniment is quiet at times, celebratory at others, and never obtrusive.The album is a treasure. We keep it going (in addition to Susie Tallman volumes and Jack Johnson's soundtrack to Curious George) as a daily soundtrack.My daughter (8 months) starts to dance and hum the minute it begins to play. She has heard it since she was about 6 weeks old. I love dancing with her and singing along as Raffi intunes, ""The more we get together..."" ""Down by the Bay"" is probably one of my daughter's favorites, and I love the sharing song."
4,Great CD,This is a great children's CD. I actually don't mind listening to it (it's not one of those ones that drives you absolutely crazy!!!)
5,Raffi's Singable Songs for the Very Young,My kids listened to Raffi's Singable Songs and now my grandkids love to sing-a-long too.
2,Raffi - Singable songs for the very young,"I have bought that tape based on the reviews of other parents and it was a huge disappointment. The melodies are way to similar to each other, the cd is boring. Furthermore in some cases it has really scary lyrics that are absolutely not suitable for a 1,5 year old child. Not recommended at all for very young audience."
2,I know he's popular -- but I can't stand to hear his voice!,"I know that Raffi is one of the most popular kid's singers. You can't go into a kids music section without seeing his face everywhere. I tried to like him, I really did. But his voice annoys the heck out of me. Doesn't anyone else notice that this guy can't sing? Yuck.Buy Kimbo's ""Six Little Ducks"", or Greg & Steve's ""Big Fun"", or Joanie Bartels ""Bathtime Magic"". In short, buy anything else!"
4,Groovy,This CD is great for kids. My 7 year old thought it was catchy enough to take a break from gangsta rap for a while. Thank you Raffi! I highly recommend this one too.Baby Beluga
5,Kids love it,Great CD for listening to in the car with kids or to have on during breakfast and getting ready for school.
3,Make sure you read the discerption,This product looked great except for when my wife purchased it she must not have read the description and we received the clear shield. The picture shown is not accurate though it looked to be just as nice as it appears in the picture.
1,horrible business,my review is simple. this company never sent me my cd so this review is horrible. i lost money and have not been compensated for it.
5,"There's nothing like it, and never will be.","SLICK RICK the RULER!!! This album (which was highly underated) was and is probably the best lyrical word play ever given to tracks.......But wait that's not even the half! When listening to this album I notice that unlike any other songs I've listened to, the beat or the instrumental is as alive as the MC, meaning the tracks in full becomes a duo or some type of super being. the back and forth between the two makes you feel that there is more presence on the album besides Ricky D. What can I say it got Crack!!"
2,Poor sound quality,"To avoid interference from router, I purchased this despite negative reviews. I should have saved my money. The sound quality is so poor that I should have returned it."
1,This Phone Sucks,This is by far the worst phone I've ever owned. It holds a charge for about 15 minutes if you're lucky and cuts out the whole time.
2,Great Disappointment,"No doubt about it, this is the weakest/worst of the Byrds' regular albums and was a huge disappointment to me when it was released. Obviously, there are some pretty good tracks here--Kathleen's Song (although swamped in strings), Pale Blue, Glory Glory--but there are also some absolute stinkers--Tunnel of Love, I Wanna Grow Up to be a Politician. What saved this album for me was Jamaica Say You Will, with a very evocative performance of a great song. This was my introduction to Jackson Browne (who wrote the song), which caused me to buy his first album when it finally came out. Regardless of the merits of the rest of the album, this alone justifies the existence of Byrdmaniax for me."
3,The Byrds Worst Album,"Almost universally acknowledged as the Byrds worst album, Byrmaniax suffers from a weak title, an awful album cover, terrible overproduction, and mediocre material. However, Roger McGuinn's ""I Trust"" is an excellent expression of his personal vision, and ""I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician"" is witty and enjoyable. McGuinn's ""Pale Blue"" and ""Kathleen's Song"" are pleasant enough, and the Parsons/White ""Green Apple Quick Step"" is excellent, original bluegrass. The rest of the original album is pretty dull. Apparently, some of the over-production problems were corrected when the album was remastered for CD, and the three new bonus songs are all exceptional. Still the Byrds' worst album, but this CD version is worthwhile."
4,1971 Album Which Can't Match Their Greatest Work.,"From their 1965 debut Mr Tambourine Man The Byrds set the highest possible standards, therefore Byrdmaniax has been a considerable disappointment to all their fans.Some of the songs are middling efforts, such as Pale Blue, I Trust, Tunnel Of Love, Absolute Happiness and My Destiny.The worst are Citizen Kane and I Wanna Grow Up To Be A Politician, the least said about them the better.Glory, Glory is a better effort, Green Apple Quick Step is a spirited instrumental and Just Like A Woman is a worthwhile Bob Dylan intrepretation.Clarence White's vocal on Think I'm Gonna Feel Better is nothing like as good as Gene Clark's rendition in the mid 1960s.The cream of the whole disc is another Clarence White vocal, Jamaica Say You Will, Jackson Browne wrote and also covered it and both are superb.Maybe this is for Byrds Completists only."
1,Remarkably Unremarkable,"This stuff doesn't come anywhere near the Byrd's best releases. There is very little attractive about it. The only tracks that come anywhere near the quality I expect out of a good Byrds record are #3 and #6. Do yourself a favor and DON'T get this one. This record is much maligned, and it deserves it!"
1,Worse than you think!,"This is the worst of the Byrds albums. The production is terrible, but may have been necessary to cover-up the poor performances. It seems that the Byrds had run out of songs to record and lacked the enthusiasm to record them. Other reviewers have identified a couple of cuts that are acceptable - I disagree. I can't find a single song that I would ever play again. The McGuinn/White/Parsons/Battin team struck out with this album, but finished on a high note with ""Farther Along"", the last Byrds album (before the boring ""Reunion"" album)."
3,Anything by Flynn is worth a read...,"I grabbed this book as soon as I saw it, based on the incredible work Flynn did with the Firestar series. Unfortunately, I do not think it lives up to the level set forth in his other novels.The underlying concept of a Babbage secret society was interesting and made for a a good plot mechanism, but the fact that the novel centered around the two main societies and their constant discovery of other secret groups grew tiresome. In some ways the irony of these groups being so focued on manipulating the world that they fail to see others doing the same thing was comical, but it happened too many times and made me feel that I was rereading the same section over again.Having made these criticisms, I still enjoyed the novel as a whole, and I would recommend it but caution you to wait for the paperback to save money."
1,Should Have Been Great,"It's so disappointing when a really interesting concept is ruined by horrible, cliche-ridden writing and cringe-worthy dialogue. Such is the case here. The novel starts strong but slides downhill quickly, devolving into a series of ever-more ridiculous scenes with, truly, some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. And without providing any spoilers, the final scene is unintentionally hilarious in its sheer awfulness. Seriously: read anything but this drivel."
2,Major disappointment,"As many other reviewers here have noted, the idea is fascinating, but it proves too much for the author to handle. The impact of all the various splinter groups is so vague and confused that it's hard to see how any of them actually affected history, and in fact most seem more interested in increasing their investment portfolios. And if this 'science' was originally developed independently by at least three groups in the 19th century, all of whom managed to build Babbage Difference Engines secretly, then why hasn't a modern group, using modern computers, likewise developed it? The 'secret' of the society is pretty easily cracked by the lead character, who lacks only a cape and a mask to qualify as a super-heroine. Most of the rest of the large cast are pretty much names without faces. And finally, though the book ends, the resolution is vague and unsatisfying."
2,An interesting idea but a stale story.,"The idea of clioligy was very interesting and certainly this makes the book worhtwhile to some extent, but the characters are unreasonable and silly in places. For instance the poor woman overcome by lust when she had the game won.(No I don't remember their names...started witha G though...) The clioligy is just window dressing to a poor spy novel. I was hoping to see characters working over a long term trying to influence history and really exploring the possibilities. I'd probably try something else if I was looking for a good sci fi read. However,I will keep my copy for the clioligy appendix. Interesting idea."
5,Spanish Cure?,Finally a spanish band that rivals the Cure and Mana. I only wish they had more CD's in the states! Must spins are this disc and Memo Rex commander
5,nice,Sci Fi meets reality in this inquisitive series that answers the true geek's what-if questions with pragmatism and enthusiasm. Even if somewhat embellished the show is great fun. My one complaint : it isn't long enough.
5,Best series on TV,"Superb video series. Bought the DVD to be able to re-watch favorite episodes such as ""Is the Universe Alive?"" Buy it."
5,Awesome,The Season is very informative and interesting.... And not to mention Morgan Freeman is a perfect choice for the series.
5,Through The Wormhole,"I don't know much about studying the universe, especially wormhole's! They have been mentioned over the years but watching this video sure sheds light on what they all about. I couldn't think of a better person to explain what science has come up with than a famous actor. Check it out.you will learn and be impressed. Morgan Freemen will impress you."
2,Still questions,"As with most of this type of video ... there were more questions raised than answers given ... it was sort of like the comment you read at the beginning of some fiction stories ... ""This is all fiction except where it is true."" Who's to know?"
3,#1 Honker,"Illinois had the reputation at one time of being the number #1 honker of all times, justifiably so. This ain't a bad recording, neither is it a great one. There are better examples of his work around on this label and elsewhere. If your taste is toward racehorse jazz coupled with some bland ballads this might be your cup of tea. For the price it is worth it. He had a great supporting cast but for whatever reason it isn't in the ""must have"" category."
1,Too many errors,"This book has good overview of ESX server, but then it does not focus really on any topic. It contains too many errors (where's the proofreading?) and chapters are in strange order (if you are beginner, you probably want get ESX installed with this book - and if you have done at least something with ESX, this is too simplistic). It however contains some commands and tips, which are for some value (which anyway are correctly written in ESX lab manual and man-pages), so this gives the only star for this book. Without silly errors, I would give two stars."
1,Too General to be of real value.,"This book is easy to read, but it is too general to be of any real value. Stick with the vendor documentation. It's free and its right."
5,A Must read,"Excellent book, that deals with the the question of what it is to be a Christian (how to come to Jesus) and how does one life the Christian life.If you've ever had doubts on what the Christian experience looks like, this book will greatly help. The the titles says ""Steps to Christ"", we often here you need to come to Jesus, but what does that mean and how does that look... This book deals with that.One of the things that I've found is that many people miss out on the power that God's grace give us to live out the Gospel. The power of the gospel empowers us to live victoriously.You will not find just ideas, but scripture is quoted throughout the entire book. It's not long or complicated. This is not about the latest fad in Christianity or the next superstar Christian teachers ideas, but it always points back to Scripture as the guide rather than the backup for idea. No her Scripture is the foundation and the ideas arise out of scripture and are subject to it."
1,zero (0) stars,I only wish I could comment on the content of the film. Unfortunately due to the extraordinarily poor quality of the disc I was only able to watch the first 17 minutes of the program because the DVD was corrupt. The quality of the DVD was so poor my DVD player was unable to continue playing any part of it after 17 minutes. I tried to skip over what I though was a bad part but none of the disc would play from the 17 minute point on. The label on the DVD itself appeared to be homemade; I don't have a problem with low buget but this was unusable.
1,Broke on first day of use!,"I used this saw for pruning a large blue spruce in our yard and it broke before I even finished limbing the bottom of the tree! It broke at the handle, don't know if its a design flaw but its not worth almost 30$."
5,Agatha Christie's Poirot on VCR,I am very pleased with this set of tapes. I have read all the books and now it's fun watching the movies. I'm pleased with the quality of the tapes. A very satisfactory transaction.
3,It is a good Movie,"But.... very slow at times.I`m such a fan, i love Poirot!!!! And i just got the collection.The movie was good, but not my favorite."
4,Good refresher/overview,"I used two books to study for my GMAT exam: Kaplan Premier and this book.""GMAT for dummies"" was a very good overview and a refresher. It helped me get quickly up to speed.However, This book however was awsome for strategies and practice. It has one significant drawback - there are no computerized tests.I found practicing on the computer extremely important.I recommend this book as an overview book but also recommend using either Kaplan Premier or some other source for online/computerized practice"
2,Dissapointing,I used this book as my only prep material for the GMAT. I mainly studied the Quantitative material and spent several months reading and studying every concept. I took the practice math exam in the book and finished it early - only missing one question.When I took the actual GMAT the math was nothing like what I studied in this book. It was much more difficult and had far more data sufficiency question types than this book predicted. There are only a few pages to prepare you for those kinds of questions and it left me totally unprepared. I did not finish the math questions in time and scored far below my potential.I will be purchasing a different book to study the math concepts that are actually tested on the GMAT. Overall I am very disappointed that I used this book.
5,Recommend for Anyone,"Would absolutely recommend for anyone applying to graduate school. Very helpful, easy to read, and great tips for exam day. Kudos!"
4,Worth your time to watch,"There are a couple of reason to give this film a look. 1. It is well acted by the entire cast. 2. The story line is intriguing. 3. The story line is (sadly) believable. 4. The music throughout is hauntingly beautiful. In fact, I have searched ( so far in vain) for the movie soundtrack. A recurring use of symbolism throughout the film, I felt added a lushness and depth to the drama as both a foreshadowing tool as well as an exclamation point to a scene just played. A better reviewer than I has suggested it be viewed more than once in order to feel deeper levels of this film, I heartily agree."
1,"Somewhat interesting, but never left the gate - not worth watching","SEMI-SPOILER ALERT. I kept expecting SOMETHING to happen... to shake up the story, make it more interesting. The acting was fine, but I felt the story was lacking. The cultural tidbits were interesting. It just felt like the movie was like a sports car sitting in a garage, looks cool, but not much worth if you never take it for a spin! Hard to connect to the characters, the storyline didn't make the characters very important to you... run of the mill movie."
5,graduate student abuse,"I saw parts of this on TV, and bought the whole thing.A similar situation (graduate faculty abuse leading to dire consequences) happened in the same town I was doing graduate work, but another institution. My whole class of graduate students was abused and mis-managed, so this film was very resonant with me.A must reading for anyone enterring graduate school; a revalation of what graduate education is often REALLY like, and how short of the mark."
2,Doesn't Matter,The first 2/3 of this movie are spent developing the characters of Liu Xing and Prof Reiser and then all the strongest character traits of those two people are just tossed aside for the ridiculous ending. That made the entire film a complete waste of time. You're left wondering what moron wrote that idiotic ending and why. Anyone with a shred of intellect isn't going to be moved by this except maybe to anger at having squandered 90 minutes on it. It could have been a decent movie. It did have a really cheap quality about it as you never see ANY other students at the school.
2,disappointing,"Pretty good 1st half, which portrays the life of a grad student (those lucky enough to have superarrogant R.D.s) But, the ending is not believable, completely out of character for the protagonist. Also, Meryl Streep is a marginal character--it's false advertising to put her on the cover."
2,Not one of her better ones!!,"As I have a collection of all of Meryl Streep's movies, I added this one but upon watching it couldn't really get into it. Found it rather gruesome, weird and sad. To me it was not one of her better movies so I would not recommend it."
5,Excellent Kirk Douglas-Walter Brennan feature,"ALONG THE GREAT DIVIDE is a fascinating character study Western, with Kirk Douglas after his man (Walter Brennan), and through it all, revealing as much about himself as about the man he is bringing to justice. Fine acting all round; excellent dialogue, and engrossing all the way. Highly recommended."
1,Title cannot be sent to my adress. I dont understand why.,"It's a plain normal western and it cannot be sent to my adress. Please tell me why !!!! If their is any reason this film cannot be sent to Switzerland, I'd like to know why !!!!"
3,It's great for a circle time activity for teachers,I used this book with my preschool class. I brought in a toy spider to go along with it. I sang the song as I read it with the children in a circle. Then I put the spider on the children and the part of the body the spider was on. This was a fun book to do.
5,A life-changing read!,I started reading this for my Women's Health course and could NOT put it down. If you are looking for a general yet intelligent and emotional overview of women's history of healing (or lack thereof) this text is for you. I highly recommend it!
3,Facts Off,"It's not a bad read, but the author's facts are a bit off.In the chapter on Denmark (which should really be titled 'Germania'), an overview of Norse Heathenism is given - and very incorrectly.Of the several facets that are listed, perhaps only two or three are accurate and the rest are the result of poor research coupled with biased writing.Grated this is only a small portion of the book, but it set up a bad relationship with me right off the bat (being a Norse Heathen myself) wherein I could not trust any of the facts in the book to be totally accurate."
4,For real Hip Hop fans only,"If you like Nelly and cash money then you wont like this.This is pure street hop from a time lost.When rap was hip hop and not a seperate entity.Pete Nice and Daddy Rich join the Beatnuts to create a highly underated,hardcore mini-masterpiece.Along with MC Serch,these two created two classic albums as 3rd bass,and returned to show another side.Sadly it didnt sell the way it should of.But if your truly a hip hop fan and not obsessed with bling and sluggish down south rhyming then you'll enjoy this."
1,HOLY JESUS!,"What the (blank) happened to Pete Nice? I had always wondered what happened to the Prime Minister after 3rd Bass imploded. I knew Serch put out a CD but I never even knew Pete did until recently. Sadly.... now I know why! I could barely even listen to this CD and haven't touched it since. If you wore out your 3rd Bass tapes back in the day and want to hear Prime Minister in action again... Just get the 3rd Bass CD's and forget this crap! Oh don't believe me?? Check out how much it's selling for.***UPDATE*** 01/24/13I've listened to this CD several hundred times since 2005 and I'll admit it.... I WAS WRONG! The Lumberjack, The Rhapsody (in J minor), Kick the Bobo and Blowin' Smoke! Pete was getting down like Charlie Brown! Guess I was so used to 3rd Bass I just couldn't hear it. This one is a gem buy it."
5,FoxyLady,This product is perfect. I now can see what I'm taking and they are clear. I definitely would recommend this product.
4,wonderfully addictive,"When i got this camera, i tried it out immediately. It was incredible; i couldn't take a bad shot. It has great features that allow for very high quality photographs. It's the perfect size and has a great price for this level of performance."
1,slowest camera on earth,Buy this camera only if you feel like missing crucial shots that you would love to have. It is the slowest thing on earth.
4,NIce Canon,Nice camera. The only problem is that Canon won't back up their products. The zoom doesn't work all the time after less than a years use. Canon said send it back but we'll charge you to check it...not very impressive!
3,Loved it until it got dropped :(,This is a great camera.... I love love love it. But dropped it only once...and that's all she wrote. Seriously.
5,Great bargain for your buck!,"After using my Sony Cybershot for 5+ years, I decided it was time for a new digital camera. My Sony had cost around $275 when I bought it, and it was considered one of the better digital cameras at the time. I thought I would purchase a new Sony Cybershot to replace the old one, but after checking them out, as well as the other brands, I changed my mind. This Canon PowerShot had most of the bells and whistles that the Sony had, but at a much lower price! I read the reviews and made my choice...the first test of the camera was on our trip to Disneyland, and the camera was terrific! Easy to use, a powerful zoom, TONS of photos with the 2gb memory card I added--what more can I say? A great little camera for the price."
4,OK camera for beginners,It has been fine experience. The problem is that the mremory card is in the battery compartment. So if you would like the card out you should bother with openig the battery port too.
4,Great,"excellent pictures in day, night or inside, good video and sound, but the battery cover broken with use"
5,Great camera for the price.,This camera is quick shooting. I have the Cannon 620 and bought this one for my daughter and family.They have had a ball with it since I bought it. Great Value. Great Product.
3,Good camera but...,"I bought this camera and I am very satisfied, but it has a downside; you can not use this camera for take night pictures, because the screen is so dark that you can not see the subject.You almost have to guess. I can not believe that my HP Photosmart E327 5MP was much better in this way."
5,Great camera,"Over all it's a fantastic little camera. The only thing I'd like better is a metal body, but its features make it well worth while anyway. Small and light-weight, easy to use. Also has an optical viewfinder - some people still prefer these though they are getting rare on digitals. It saves battery life to shoot without it, and the monitor is always there if you want to use its preview mode, so having the option is nice.The camera starts up quickly and shutter lag is minimal (I'm used to a 4 yr-old Olympus which is slow so I really like it).Canon is known for good optics, a superb CMOS sensor, and excellent processor (DIGIC II). From using this camera I can tell how good those are. It also takes AA batteries, which are easy to find and cheap!In short, a great camera."
2,Terrible pictures,"I received this as a gift from my mother when my Panasonic Lumix was dropped in the sand and stopped working. She wanted pics of the grandkids and was tired of me using the broken camera excuse. I have now used it at my daughters gymnastics meet and outdoors at Red Rock Canyon in Las Vegas. The indoor pictures using zoom were all throw aways. Not a single shot came in focus. The lighting was typical gymnasium light, very bright. I tried shooting on about 5 different settings with and without flash.On to RedRocks. In some shots the sky (which was brilliant blue) came out white. In the shots where the sky turned out blue, the vibrant red rock looked over exposed.This camera is not worth the plastic it is made from. I am going to sell it on Ebay and go back to the Lumix for my point and shoot needs."
4,Great Camera!,"I researched this camera before purchasing and knew I would be making a wise purchase considering the price and ease of use. I have a higher end camera (digital SLR) that I'm very fond of, but wanted a point and shoot to slip in my purse. I'm not disappointed I bought this one... the colors are amazing! If you are looking for a beginner camera, this is the one. If you are a more experienced photographer and want a camera to slip in your pocket that you can rely on, this one will work for you too!"
1,This camera fizzled out after two months......,I bought this camera in July and by August I was having troubles with it. It keeps on saying low battery and shutting itself off. I've replaced batteres with fresh ones and cleaned the contacts. This camera is defective.
4,Canon camera,"I purchased the Canon A540 for my daughter, so when I was looking to purchase a camera for myself, knowing how good the Canon was, I decided to purchase the A550. I am very happy with it."
3,The good and the bad.,"The bad is the batteries expire quickly once the camera is connected to the computer. It's difficult to open the filmsy door to insert the batteries. Another bad is it's hard to see the item in the camera's display in the sun, too much reflection.The good is the pictures come out good. The camera is easy to use. I'm the type that hits buttons to see what they do. I haven't destroyed any thing yet. The software that comes with the camera is ok. Another product is needed to really edit a photo.Over all it's a good camera for a beginner and the money."
2,"Mechanically Flawed, Photos are OK","If you are a novice photographer, you will probably not notice the oddities with this camera. In many cases, the photos are overexposed on sunny days. Underwater photography (in underwater housing) is so-so. It does pretty well in low light conditions (after manually setting the ISO really high). The nifty little shutter on the front started to stick upon opening after owning it for 4 months (I keep it in a case, so this is definitely a mechanical design flaw). Movies are of good quality. Gets good life out of rechargeable batteries. I'd only buy it again if I couldn't find another camera with this many features that took no more than 2 AA batteries."
5,From Basic to Complex,"After doing some online research, I decided to purchase this camera due to the large number of positive reviews it had received, along with the reasonable price. (This is my first digital camera purchase.) As someone who is limited in their technical knowledge, I wanted something that would give me good results, without complicated instructions. I have been very happy with the photos I have taken so far... and I haven't even used all the features that this camera offers! I am looking forward to becoming even more familiar with all of its capabilities -- and using it to its fullest potential. I like the fact that it uses 2 double-A batteries, because those are relatively inexpensive and easy to find. Also, it is small enough to fit in my purse, which has worked out great for plane travel."
4,Good little camera,"I bought this camera as a replacement for my very old 2.1 MP Kodak Easyshare. I really like the ease of use and the picture quality. One thing I really like is that it is ready to take a photo within one or two seconds of turning the camera on. My old camera would take a few seconds. I also like that the camera uses AA batteries and an SD memory card.The only thing I would like to see on this camera that it doesn't have, and the one thing that makes my rating a four instead of five, is an anti-blur feature. Other than that I am very pleased."
3,shutter sticking,This camera is fairly simple to use. However I have only had it 2 months and the shutter fails to open periodically. I have to open it manually which I am afraid may damage the lens. It's better than the polaroid digital I had before but I'm not totally happy with it.
3,good camera,"This is a good camera, but could be smaller and sleeker for ease in taking with you in a purse and such. Gave as a gift to Mom and played with it a little, but she doesn't really use it much. She uses her phone to take pics more since it's always with her in her purse."
3,Uses Regular AA Batteries,This is a good camera but it still takes regular batteries instead of being able to plug in and be recharged. This can be a pain on a trip as you will have to also either pack extra batteries or a battery charger for rechargeable ones. It is also a bit heavy because of the batteries. Still a good deal but something you may want to know.
5,Canon A555,"This is the best camera you will find for the price. It really is easy to use and takes awsome pictures. Amazon,s price beat even Ebay,s."
4,Fatastic Camera and I am using the same one since june 2007....night mode not good,"This was my first ever digi cam. I bought it in June 2007. So its been more than 2 yrs now and I am having no issues with this Canon baby. I would surely recommend this cam to everyone.All in all , it has been a fantastic camera for the last 2 yrs of my use and still going well.Only issue I have found is when you shoot in night-mode , the images get blured and photo objects get mixed with each other."
1,Don't try to expediate this product,"I spent 30.00 extra to get this product expediated to the person I bought it for. The product was delivered 10 days later rather than 3 days; thus, the present didn't reach the person I bought it for in time for their birthday. Therefore, I would advise ordering this from another company if you need it delivered on time!!!!"
5,Great documentary,This was great! It gave me a whole new appreciation for my parents. I highly recommend this documentary to everyone.
5,Mission of Justice kicks A$$!!,"This is a darn good martial arts movie! Terrific choreographed action sequences. Good story to follow. And a good role for Stallone's ex-wife, Brigitte Neilsen"
3,A screwball comedy with SF trappings,"I didn't read the dedication before starting the story, so I took a little longer than I should have to realize that this was Preston Sturges's ""The Lady Eve"". If you like one, you'll probably like the other."
3,"Well edited, whole family may read it.","Very well written and edited. The whole family might enjoy this little sci-fi book, imaginative but at the end lacks a little something to give it a higher rating."
4,very nice book,"A classic, but I wish it were written in American English. Sometimes feels a little dry compared to the text by Dudley Underwood. Author gives little historical context. A few practice problems would have been nice."
3,Number Theory,"The book was an excellent accumulationof Number Theoretic ideas. However, itfailed to produce applications or clearcutexamples of the theorems."
2,Not the Bevington!,"Although the product description includes a long section called ""From the Back Cover"" which explains in excruciating detail why the Bevington is the best edition, it turns out this text has nothing to do with this item and is not the back cover text. This is not the Bevington edition, and the much praised notes and numbering system are not used in this item.This description should be modified, as it is extremely misleading!"
2,workmanship,"The workmanship in this 6th Edition is less than satisfactory. Several of my fellow seminar students had their books split upon opening the front cover of the hardback. Apparently, the inside of the cover and first page are defective, either in material or application. My copy has not split yet. However, it is obvious that there is stress and it is just a matter of time. I hope the appropriate person at Amazon reads this."
3,No Table of Contents,"This is a noble effort, and one cannot argue the price, but there is no table of contents or other way to manuever through the titles. I wasn't planning on starting on page 1 and reading to the end. Just inconvenient - that's all."
1,Terrible formatting,"Don't buy this if you want to read it, the formatting is terrible. It's like whoever created it just rendered the public domain version in notepad and converted that to a e-book. Instead buy ""The Complete Plays Of Shakespeare (Special Kindle Illustrated and Commented Edition) for the same price.Don't take my word for it, download a sample. I ended up buying the other one. This version should get zero stars."
1,Ditto,I am entering my disgust with the kindle version just to add another 1 star review. I was misled by reviews of the paper version and did not realize that the kindle version is unusable until I bought it.
5,The Bard for the Digital Generation!,"Shakespeare must be one of the most recognizable names in the world and I think it is wonderful that we have collections like this that allow us to preserve his immortal words for the next generation and the next. I am a techie girl, but I love classic literature too and the combination of Shakespeare on Kindle is just a great thing. That said, I think this a great collection and I only wish Shakespeare had written more! Anyway, I look forward to reading the words of one of my favorite writer on a digital screen!"
5,"If I were to rank it 1 to 10, I would give it eleven!","This book was excellent- the commentary was extremely useful in interpreting the text, and Shakespeare himself was quite magnificent. He shows the capabilities of the mind, to the far reaches of our feelings, while philosophically expressing himself in the way we work."
2,What table of contents?,"I just purhased this version of Shakespeare's Complete Works and there is no table of contents when you open it! How am I supposed to navigate without a ToC?? Maybe mine will update like the other customer said his did, but right now I'm very disappointed with this purchase."
5,The Standard By Which Others Are Judged,How can you rate the best there has ever been? He has been studied for centuries by students of literature for very good reasons.
1,No table of content,This book does not have a table of contents. Can you imagine finding what you want in the COMPLETE works of Shakespeare without a ToC?
1,this version is not indexed for search,"i purchased this edition expressly because it claimed to be easily searchable. When I downloaded it to my Kindle, I discovered this was falsely advertised. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
2,"Away, Vile Formatting!","This ebook formatting of all of Shakespeare's works seemed too good to be true. And in this case, it is. The formatting on the plays is not good and makes them practically unreadable. The character names appear above the lines they speak but there's no differentiation between the character and the lines so it's very confusing. And unless you're reading with the matching font size the lines end strangely. Sometimes a cheap Kindle version of a classic is worth weird formatting issues but with Shakespeare it can get confusing. If only they had perfected the formatting. I thought having all of Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and poems on my Kindle would be an invaluable way to carry Shakespeare with me everywhere but I'll need to go back to my hard copy versions."
1,Avoid: A badly formatted mess,Poorly formatted with sentences broken in half and continued 2 lines down. Each dialogue is separated by an empty line - a huge waste of space for Kindle owners. Look elsewhere.
1,Kindle edition is a Guttenberg Project text and probably illegal,"To my great disappointment, the Kindle edition is simply a Guttenberg Project text, complete with their copyight notices prohibiting commercial distribution. The Kindle publishers did not even bother to add a usable table of contents. How can one locate anything in 50,000+ pages of text without any cross-referencing? I will be informing Guttenberg project about this - they are being ripped off."
2,A favorite line marred by typo,"Having just downloaded my copy, I eagerly searched for some favorite quotes. Going straight to ""but man, proud man...."" in Measure for Measure, the fact that ""spleens"" had become ""speens"", ruined my enjoyment completely. In view of the material at hand, I would have expected a little more care to have gone into the final proofing of the text. Instead of risking more of the same, I think I'll just forget about the 3.99 and get a different version."
5,Amazing!,"There's not much more I could ask for with this collection. I got my Kindle recently, after a long wait. And I've been waiting, impatiently, to load it up with a lot of the classic literature I love. This has been my first stop and I am very happy with this collection. Besides from the content and the plays, which are already amazing, I found the formatting of this Kindle edition to be real easy to read and move around in. As for the plays themselves, I am so glad I seem to have got more than I originally thought I would get, with these extra plays. Highly recommended."
3,"Confused, confused, confused!!!","I'm relatively new to the world of Kindle, and the thought of keeping all of Shakespeare in my purse seemed really, really cool! All the reviews keep mentioning the awesome table of contents... but I can't find it!! Could someone please help me with this?As far as I can tell, this really is an awesome collection, but I'm deducting a couple of stars because I find it impossible to navigate!!"
2,No line numbers - don't buy for school,"Yeah, all the works are there. If you are not experienced in reading shakespeare, this is NOT for you. The annotations that it claims to have are there, but there are not at the bottom of the page like they are in a book, you have to go search in the poorly designed appendix for the annotations.NO LINE NUMBERS. If you buy this for a college class, you will be lost. You may be able to search and find, but its hard.Formatting is often off and not always uniform, making it harder to read than necessary."
5,The digital age is amazing!,"This is the reason I love having Kindle!!! The fact that I can have a huge Shakespeare collection with all of his plays in it and I can carry it around with me and read it anywhere I am is so cool! As for the collection itself, it is Shakespeare of course, so it was going to be great stuff anyway, but its also so amazing that I now have a whole bunch of his plays that I've never even heard of before, and carry them along with me too! Just scrolling through them and seeing new characters and stuff makes me think how amazing this modern digital age is. They are really cool! I think this kind of electronic collection in our modern digital age s really making it a great time to be alive!"
5,Enjoying it all,"The language of Shakespeare is so beautiful, and I have always been a fan of it. It has this magical ethereal quality that so awe inspiring and inspirational. So I was very excited to be able to get a complete collection for my Kindle. And when I read about these extra plays that I know nothing about, I was even more excited. I'm really enjoying reading my favorites and these news ones!"
3,No indexing,The formatting and TOC seem relatively good but when you use search this book to find words or phrases a dialogue box pops up to tell you that this item has not yet been indexed and that the search cannot be completed.
1,Poorly formated piece of garbage.,"There is no table of contents. Best you get are categories ""Comedy's"", ""Tragedies"", etc. From there you have to flip page by page to the play you want to read hoping that you one day find it. Also a great many general errors as well with spacing. Something that happens frequently is this:SPEAKER 1: Blah blah blah.SPEAKER 2: Blah blah!SPEAKER 1: Blah!Very glad I only paid $2 for this."
3,it works okay,"This is decent thing to have on kindle if you are reading at your own pace but is difficult for other uses such as school. I am taking a Shakespeare course and it is hard to follow along with class because it doesnt give line numbers, the dialogue is not neatly broken up and you cant just jump from scene to scene with class unless you go through and mark the pages before hand."
3,Good EP,"The downside: Tim Owens stinks compared to Matt Barlow. Too bad Matt left, but it's his life, and I salute him for his choice to pursue a criminal justice degree and wish him the best of luck.The upside: The band is still good. The songs aren't the same without Matt's vocals, and I hate the way-overdone, 80s-style vocals that Ripper has, but it's not enough to kill Schaffer's great work. The new Iced Earth lyrical material will surely not appeal to the European crowd that loves the band so, as Europeans despise American pride (it does get annoying when people boast about being American), but if they concentrate on the music, they'll like it enough. I'm looking forward to a good album by Iced Earth.BTW: I gave this 3 stars for 1) the bad vocals and 2) the fact that I really don't like EPs."
2,Somtimes he fits..sometimes he does'nt,"Well sorry to say but Red Baron,The Reckoning,and the first song Declaration Day are the best songs.I've heard the whole album and sorry to say the rest is well..pretty darn cheesy.The riffs are very mundane for iced earth..i mean come on they do it on a few songs lets keep it steady.And the main 9/11 song when the eagle cries is very thoughtful..but lacks that certain passion it should have.Especially with Ripper on vocals..to me it seems that sometimes he fits and other songs he doesnt..mostly the soft songs.Just seems that Matt was SUPPOSE to sing on these..but fate didnt allow it.But it is a good dedication album to americans and freedom..but not in the world of hardcore iced earth fans..sorry."
2,Be careful,"Someone else said it best about Ripper Owens era Judas Priest:""Ripper Owens has done to Judas Priest what Blaze Bailey did to Iron Maiden.""He's now doing the same thing to Iced Earth. This is an album that Jon Schaffer will rerecord in a second if they ever find a decent vocalist again. You almost have to ignore all of the vocals and listen to the music. If I could I'd take the vocals out of the album and leave the rest of it as is, and I'd like to do the same for the Glorious Burden when it comes out I'm sure."
2,Wrong item!,"I was sent the wrong item. Unfortunately, the merchant didn't have the charger on the picture and my phones remain dead."
1,Terrible,"This Dvd is terrible ... the picture quality is junk and there isnt even a menu its just one continuous loop of biggie songs, no pauses or intros it just goes right from one to the other. Quite Disappointing."
4,this is how its done,Great melodic death..some people are whining about synthesizer and samples that are on here..but they are minor in my opinion. the riffs and songs are memorable. Their last cd 'My Passion // Your Pain' was a 5 star cd..so if you like this one DEFINITELY check out that one.
4,AN ARTFUL LOOK INTO THE WORLD OF BEAUTY AND HISTORY,"Can't tell a Baldung from a Balthus? Think Carpaccio is the name of a spaghetti sauce? Do you insist Cubism has something to do with blocks of frozen ice? Thomas Hoving, the former Director of New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, is here to lend aguided hand through the palette known as ""art."" This fun and friendly guide removes art from its lofty perch high upon a pedestal (marble, Italian Renaissance) and chronicles its history in plain-English. The extras are endless: there's a museum checklist (where to go, what to see, what to avoid); how to start a collection without spending a bundle and shocking --- but true! --- anecdotes of artists and their work. And the introduction by Andrew Wyeth paints a rather nice picture as well."
4,"a good, easy, broad introduction","Before I read this book I knew less about art than perhaps any human alive. Now, having read the book, I know slightly more than less than any human alive. It's an easy, fun, broad introduction to art. It suffers terribly from insufficient illustrations (what do you want for the low price?) and the color prints are in isolated sections that are not well keyed to the text which means you spend a fair amount of time looking for the piece in question. All said there is good information from a reliable source for someone just ""walking in the door"", so to speak.From here the next two books are the much more thorough and pricier books: ""History of Art: Slipcased"" (sixth edition) by Jansen and, for art appreciation, ""Living With Art"" (fifth edition) by Rita Gilbert. They are the standards in their respective fields. These two and, of course trips to your local museum."
4,Best thing I took to Italy,"I read this on the plane to Italy and then took it around with me on our tour. It was amazing how much more I loved my experience in Italy (Rome, Florence, Venice, especially) because of this book. I actually looked forward with huge anticipation to seeing doors and domes and paintings, something that my very limited experience with art would have previously been boring to me. I really felt like I could understand so much better what I was seeing and experiencing because of this book. Also, I could have spent days in the museums, something I have never thought of doing before. All the symbolism was so rich and interesting..."
2,"Not very interesting, few illustrations","I have to disagree with any reviewer who says it's okay for an ART book not to have lots of illustrations! This book has very few illustrations, most of them in black and white - and the color ones are too small and are not good reproductions. If the writing were really good, I might be able to overlook the lack of illustrations, but it's just mediocre. The information is very basic and disjointed."
3,Starry Night's flipped,"I liked his anecdotes a lot and I agree with his overall philosophy about art, but agree with others on the shortcomings."
2,Interesting but with one MAJOR flaw,"An interesting author who knows his art but I found this a frustrating book to read because Hoving describes one great piece of artwork after another but only a small number are actually illustrated. Even a bad picture is better than no picture. The author tries his best but the beauty of words just don't measure up to the beauty of the artwork. Next time, the publisher should spend a couple of extra bucks and put in a few more pictures for us dummies out there who are not as knowledgeable as Hoving. They have, to their credit, included some nice color pages in the front and end of the book."
3,But Of Course,"As a successful writer and former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the author is guaranteed a large attentive audience. What a tragically missed opportunity then, as the result looks, feels and reads as if it were tossed together, less interesting and less persuasive than a second-rate art appreciation text. This is precisely what a ""dummy"" doesn't need. One wonders how Andrew Wyeth, who wrote the foreword, feels about having his name on it now. (Copyright by Roy R. Behrens, from Ballast Quarterly Review, Vol 15 No 2, Winter 1999-2000.)"
5,Just like the one in Half-Life!!!,"IRAN = IS THE DOG EMPTY?! Or something to that extent. This crowbar has the same colors, nice length, it's made in the wonderfull Japan, AND it was first avialable on SEPTEMBER 30TH 2003! The original release date for HALF-LIFE 2! Coincidence? I think not. BUY THIS CROWBAR! It's a great addition to any Half-Life fanatics collection of completly useless Half-Life related junk!"
5,Classic material from a very special time,"Okay, you can listen to that other clueless dude from Toronto, or you can listen to me, Hip Hop Connoiseur who was born and lived his whole life in Brooklyn, New York and followed Hip Hop since 1982.When the Legion dropped in 1994, it was some downright nasty new material. This is vintage Hip Hop out of the Uptown and Bronx area of NYC. When I first heard Jingle Jangle in 1994, I wasn't crazy about it, but a lot of my friends were loving it. So I listened some more, and before you knew it I was hooked.This is by no means some commercial G Unit radio play material; this is what it is: that classic 1994 Bronx sound."
4,decent quality,"These are nice enough, but I don't think I would pay more than $10-$15 tops for a set of 2--certainly not the ridiculously inflated ""list"" price of $75! They earn 4 stars only because of the low price I paid (less than $9 for the set); otherwise, they are really only about a 3-star quality. They are pretty enough, serviceable, and seem fairly sturdy, but they are just fairly ordinary glassware."
3,Disappointed,"Even those these chargers were beautiful, the plates in my Christmas china rocked so badly that I would never use them with that china. They were fine with my day-to-day china, but I would want to use them with both. They would be great to use as a serving plate, but I have plenty of those already."
4,still happy,I've had a pair of these in my basement for a few years now. I play loud rock most of the time and they work great through my ancient pioneer amp. Haven't blown them up yet! A really robust speaker for the price.
5,the price is right,For how much it is its a good buy. id highly recommend this to any one. it sounds pretty good. lost of bass and over all its really good.
5,Great So Far,"So far these have been great speakers. I just needed something smaller for out living room T.V. and these work great. I'm certainly not an audio expert, but these sound very good to me. They have nice bass and make watching movies much more enjoyable."
4,Battleships,"Great speaker for the- price.Powerful sound and they can handle a lot of volume. They sound better if played loud. Great for parties and for really knocking down the walls. They work with any amp/receiver, but a very strong amp will bring out their best. While a weaker amp will display more of their shortcomings. If you are looking for an inexpensive and ""decent"" set of speakers, these will work great. However, they are enormous for bookshelf speakers. If you have a critical ear, and are used to speakers costing more then $400 a pair, then these probably won't pass your test."
5,Perfect for Me,These speakers are more than I need. I built a 7.1 surround sound system and used these as my front speakers. They are larger than they appeared in the photos. I use them as floor speakers. I could not be happier.
5,Excellent,This speaker is great. Very clear and has great range. Almost don't need the separate subwoofer...perfect for my home theater setup.
5,Excellent Value,I'd read some reviews on these speakers; but it's difficult to really know how a product will perform for you until you try it out for yourself.The high end frequency response is excellent and I get a nice smooth lower frequency...the bass sounds full and clear. I'm very happy with these speakers...like I said they are a great product for the money. I'm actually surprised how good they are.
4,"very good speakers, dirty cheap","awesome speakers for the price. They are smaller than I thought - which is actually good news - and they sound very good. But, really, for $80 a pair, your next upgrade will probably cost you over $500. I would stick with these, they do their job very very well."
4,Sony SS-B3000 Speakers,"I recently replaced my small bookshelf speakers with the Sony B-3000's for my front surround speakers. Great improvement with a lot more power and clarity compared with the old smaller bookshelf speakers. Just note that these will not disappear into the room. They are decent sized, however, the added power and clarity more than make up for that."
5,sony ss-b3000 bookshelf speakers,"priced very fairly, arrived timely and of good quality. i have enjoyed the sound quality very much since i received them."
4,Great deal!,"I gave these four stars because I got these speakers a few months ago and they haven't yet stood the test of time that would make them five-star speakers.They sound great. People come over to my house just to listen to their music on these speakers. Accurate, deep sound, and considering the unimpressive receiver I own, they were a great buy. I would definitely recommend them. One thing - if you intend on spacing them out a great deal, you should buy extra speaker wire, because the wire they come with is not that long."
4,Serves its purpose very well,I bought these to replace an old pair of Boston Acoustic in which the plastic had degraded after more than 25 years. I listen to classic music and DVDs and these fit the bill very well.I am not an absolute audiophile but I like what I hear -recommended
5,"Great speakers, but shallow sound","I'm on a tight budget because I'm a college student and I was looking around everywhere for speakers that could handle everything by themselves (good bass quality, nice highs and mids). As of right now, my setup only has these two speakers and they are hooked up to a Denon AVR-1507 and they sound really good. The only concern of mine with the speakers is that the sound seems a little on the shallow side for the bass, but its not too bad. By themselves these speakers definitely can stand on there own and for anybody on a budget looking for great speakers these are it. I feel that even though the bass is just a tad shallow it doesn't merit giving these speakers 4 stars, they are definitely 5 star speakers. As soon as I pair these with a woofer, I'm sure they would sound even better."
5,Pretty Important,Maybe this is obvious but it wasn't to me. I used the wires that they came with. I was excited to set them up and hear them. When I first plugged these in I was let down. I was so disappointed in the way that they sounded. Then I ordered some 16-gauge speaker wire and they were totally different. They became a different product.Please use real speaker wire and I think you will be impressed.
5,Good Value,"These are very nice, efficient, quality speakers. They aren't top of the line and would not satisfy an audio purist but they work very well in a home system. I have them backed up by an HSU subwoofer and that makes a good combination with really good sound for not a lot of money. I have another pair as well without the subwoofer and these little speakers can handle some awesome bass for their size. I enjoy pipe organ music and many speakers just can't do justice to a pipe organ. The combination can and even the speakers alone without the subwoofer do very well."
4,"Quality Sound, larger than expected","Good speakers, match the output of my receiver. I expected ""book end"" speakers to be much smaller than these but would buy them again."
4,it depends,"for the price, you can't beat them. it's not that you should 'settle' for these, but for me the use is different. i use these in my gym and they work great. i wouldn't use them for my surround system unless you are on a very tight budget."
3,Boohshelf speakers,These may be good as front speakers but definitely not for surrounds but Sony is good quality just for fronts .
2,NOT BOOKSHELF,"though they were good read other ratings sound is not good they had some damage on one bought yamaha6490 129.95 great should have gotten an other pair for 29.00 dollars more don,t like sony at all that,s why they were 109.00 will not listen to other people,s review any more"
4,Fits the purpose well,Bought the first pair of the Sony B3000 speakers a month ago for an old Sansui reciever and was impressed on the quality. Enough I purchased a second pair. For the $$ it was a good purchase.
5,What a purchase,"Great price $99 for the pair.Great service. I ordered these speakers Thursday night and they were delivered Saturday morning, and for FREE!!! How do you top that?As for the speakers, they replaced a pair of Mourdant Shorts I bought close to twenty years ago that have lost their ommf, These Sony's are clean sounding and effortlessly powerful, I can't wait until thet have been broken in. You won't be dissapointed.You won't need a sub woofer but maybe a hard of hearing neighbor."
4,good sound for the size and price,"I am very happy with these speakers. They are mounted in my basement rec room. I wall mounted them by using a short strip of metal fastened to the back, wire them to my amp, and the jo was done. Good sound and easy install."
4,Great Value and Great Sound! Weird Size...,"I purchased these for a simple analog 2.1 channel AV application. Everything is running through a Sherwood receiver and the speakers sound great! My only negative comment might be the size. They are just an odd size. I knew what the size was when I ordered them and anticipated placing them on speaker stands. At 20"" tall and 10"" square they just look top heavy. The wife is afraid I would create a death trap for the cat should he knock one off the stands. Regardless, I found an alternate mounting option and everything sounds great. The cat is safe and we are now enjoying DVD's, Netflix and content from my new Roku player with complete enjoyment. Even NPR radio sounds better...Yes, buy them, but don't use with tall flimsy speaker stands."
4,Great value...decent sound,"I was looking for a pair of speakers in between floor standing and bookshelf size, so these fit the bill. )n sale for $69 at the time I ordered...a great deal. Excellent definition but a little on the bright side. I would prefer a fuller, warmer midrange. I'm using these on a pair of wooden floor stands that gets the speakers about 14"" off the floor, which enhanced clarity and smoothed out the bass response. With this and a discontinued Sony receiver, I was able to get a great sound system for my high-ceiling bedroom for about $150."
4,great replacement speakers,"Rapid shipment, great sound, perfect size for small space, so far so good. Very happy with quality, time will tell on longevity."
3,i got what i wanted,"i did not like the sound coming out of my samsung plasma. it is not terrible, but it has very little base to it, (as well as distorted) at higher volumes.i would have loved a surround sound system but the TV is in our living room and my wife won't let me string wires all over the place. i had some old rogersounds i put up but my wife did not like their looks. i saw these on amazon and thought they might work. they work just fine. i can play a rock band DVD and actually hear the instruments. my wife thinks they look good. i am running them through a sony receiver.HOWEVER - no one will ever mistake these for high fidelity. treble is not clear, midrange is also a little mushy, actually everything is a little mushy. why do i like them? the sound is easily 3 times better than my TV. i can turn up the volume and they do not distort like the TV would. and they look good."
4,Not Bad,I'm building a small system with a budget in mind. I needed something quick to start with. I'm old school and wanted a bigger woofer for my main speakers. These do produce a strong bass but I tweeked down the boom (caused by the ported design) with a quality subwoofer. Polk Audio would have been better but these are great for the price.
5,Sony SS-B3000,"These speakers are a great bargain. Like the other reviews say the speakers are a little larger than normal bookshelf speakers, but if you know that going in, you will be pleased with the value they present. The sound is good and the price is great. Enjoy!"
5,Awesome speakers at a great price,"I recently got these speakers for use in my apartment. After reading my reviews on them, I decided to try them out. For the price, you simply can't go wrong. They have awesome sound and can get pretty loud. I would recommend them"
2,Lasted less than a year.,"I was pleased with the speakers initially, but after less than a year, there is crackling and serious sound distortion. I was using them with a 40-watt amp. Now I need a replacement."
2,sony ss-b3000 speakers - amaZON,i was surprised that my pre-amp could over drive the speakers and cause them sub-woofer to flutter. i have to be careful with the volume and equalizer bass setting.
4,Good product for a great price,Very pleased. Product works good and the price was far less than at my local electronics store. I recommend it.
3,Not bad,"All in all, good sound quality for the money. Not much presence at low volume levels, but the sound fills out as you turn it up."
3,too good to be true,"I bought these to replace Kenwood speakers that I purchased in 1987. A woofer on one of the Kenwoods had failed. I was expecting to pay a lot of money for good speakers, but the reviews for the Sony SS-B3000 convinced me I could get great quality for a small price. I bought the Sonys and was disappointed. The sound was muted compared to my one good Kenwood. I use these exclusively for music, and they just don't perform satisfactorily. Maybe ok for gaming, can't say. I packed them up and shipped them back to Amazon, who quickly processed my refund in full."
5,Raffi Rules,I taught kids with autism (ages 5-8) and Raffi was part of our daily routine. Baby Beluga was a favorite. The children just love his music. I now have a 5 month old daughter who just loves listening to Raffi music. We sing and dance to it for hours. I recommend all of his CDs highly to teachers and parents.
5,Excellent Customer Service,A great transaction---seller is honest and caring and has excellent communication with the buyer. THANK YOU
5,Lots of Fun!,"We love this CD. The songs are great and lots of fun to sing along with. It pleasantly surprised me that although these songs were recorded in 1980, they don't sound 80's. I would recommend buying this book along with it for even more fun!Baby Beluga (Raffi Songs to Read)"
3,"Ok, but not as good as some of his others",We love Raffi and own a lot of his CD's. This one only has a few good songs. I would be ok without it.
2,"A few good songs, but gets very annoying very fast","The title song is wonderful, and my daughter loves it. The rest of the songs, however, are very annoying for the adults to listen to over and over. The CD frankly drove me nuts from the second time through. If you are looking for something to add to a play list, I would look elsewhere."
2,This Album is the Cat's Meeeow!,"I am a big fan of Raffi, and I have been since birth. I was even a fan of his while inside of my mother. My dad did a show of his in Tampa Florida and I began kicking my mom's stomach when I heard his voice. He is the best! I am sure I will listen to him for the rest of my life, until I die."
5,My second copy,"My granddaughter and I literally wore out our first copy of ""Baby Belluga"" by the time she was three. I recently bought a new copy for her year-old brother, so that he could experience the same musical fun. This CD is a real musical treasure!"
5,CD for kids: A+,"If yoy do not own any Raffi CDs, this is a good one to start. The songs are cheerful, fun and this is one of my favorite kid-CDs. Bought it as a gift."
5,A keeper,"My daughter loved this music when she was little and now I bought the same CD for our grand daughter. You won't mind hearing this over and over, which cannot be said for some purple friends :-)"
5,Raffi great as always!,"I listened to Raffi growing up, and always loved him! I enjoy how he encorporates fun and silly songs with educational songs!"
5,Raffi's music is superb for children.,"We own several Raffi CD's and we (and our 18 month old daughter) love all of them. I wholeheartedly agree that ""Baby Beluga"" is the best children's song I have ever heard."
5,Thank you Raffi,"I put this CD on when my 5 month old son starts to get cranky. From the moment he hears the whale sounds, a smile spreads across his face. If he is tired, by the time ""Thanks a Lot"" plays, his eyes close peacefully. That's when I sing ""Thanks a Lot"" to Raffi. This is truly a classic."
5,Happy to see this classic back in print,"""Mary's Land"" is a colorful and detailed novel of a time at the beginning of Europeans' migration to the New World. Robson's novel puts the reader into the thick of the action from the long journey on a small ship to the taming of the frontier. The characters are people you care about. You cheer them on when they find success and cry for them when they don't. Wonderful to see it back in print."
4,color and confusion,"Robson writes a vivid and colorful description of life in the seventeenth century. She provides details of the Bristolwaterfront, Catholic persecution, Atlantic Ocean passage and life in early America. Her characters are flawed but easy tolove. Unfortunately the story unravels three quarters of the way through and confuses the reader with the facts of earlyMaryland history."
2,TOO much detail,"I loved RIDE THE WIND and other books by this author, but this one is a struggle for even a history lover to read. I appreciate the exhaustive research she obviously put into the book, but the details obscure the characters and make the novel dull, dull, dull. Unless there are well-developed characters, all the earthy language and descriptions of customs in the 17th century won't make an interesting book. This was supposed to be a historical NOVEL, wasn't it?"
5,A revisit to the 60s - SMASHING ....,"I am from Singapore, who had bought particularly a CD on Hank Marvin (Ex-Shadows) for my dad as a birthday present, who was a staunch fan of the shadows in the 60s - some 4 years ago. I immediately become a fan same as my dad, when I started hearing Hank Marvin's guitaristic tunes.Till today, for 4 years since purchasing the guitaristic CD - I am still very impressed for the guitaristic tunes in the 60s. I particulary like the 'Summer Holiday' guitaristic tune played by Hank Marvin - which was played absolutely fantastic (in remix sort of style esp the guitaristic tunes) - I could go on hearing and hearing again - and I wouldn't get tired of it. I like other musical tracks as well - 'I could easily fall(in love w/ you), 'It's all in the game', 'living doll', 'the young ones' etc..,I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musical guitars of the 60s."
5,Simply phenomenal,Late era Byrds at their best both live and in the studio. The extra live tracks more than make this a good buy but combined with the unreleased studio songs and of course Untitled itself make this a must have for any fans of rock & country.
3,Last of the great Byrds,"Okay album, but in my opinion the vocals sounded weak, perhaps it was due to the mixing of the recording."
5,"Well, actually, I just bought it","Sometimes the idea of a song that is burned into your mind just hits as you're going along. I've never heard *that* version of Eight Miles High since college in 1970 (it belonged to my room mate) and I want to hear it again. And the rest of the album too, which was wonderful.I just ordered it and fully expect to be rewarded (hence the 5 stars).Most reviewers seem to agree with me. Too bad the one guy doesn't have the attention span for 16 minutes of playing. It is such a high as they bring the tune along and climax at the end. I can't wait for it to show up in the mail!"
4,Y?N-Vee Tells You Why You Are Some Tricks-In-Training,"A group out of south central in '94 appeared on 2Pac's Thug Life CD and made an impact so much that they was given an opportunity to show off the pimptress lyrics and sounds on the debut and only album that featured the hit ""Chocalate"", a remake of the classic of the late Rick James ""Mary Jane"". Also, I agree their version of ""I'm Goin' Down"" is better than Mary J's and this was released before hers subsequently in early '95 but did not get a lot of airplay on the radio. Some of the songs on here don't have the best production but Y?N-Vee makes up with their g-funk lyrics and voices like on ""Tricks-N-Training""(my favorite), ""Str8 Hustler"", the title track ""Y?N-Vee"" in which they rip the track up, and ""We've Got A Good Thang"". So for all you g-funk lover's that miss the g-funk era(the best era) of rap, pick it up."
4,NO PLAY,Y?N VEE THE HAD THIS THUG BUT SEX APPEAL ABOUT THEM. I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE FROM THE WEST COAST. IF THEY HAD TUPAC BEHIND THEM THEN THAT WOULD BE A GOOD REASON WHY THEY HAVE THAT THUG APPEAL WHICH I THOUGHT WAS GREAT. THESE GIRLS CAN SING AND CHOCOLATE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS. THEY DIDN'T GET MUCH OF A CHANCE TO SHOW WHAT TALENT THEY REALLY HAD.
1,out of date. Don't waste your money.,"Since there is no off-Broadway commercial scene these days, this book is a time capsule.Don't waste your money.If you try to produce your show off-Broadway, you will waste much, much more!"
3,Amen ~ Paula Cole,"Like many others, I was very suprised with the quality of Paula's second album ""This Fire"". A bold and dark album about her inner torments and hate. After a while I also bought Harbinger, not as good as This Fire but a strong debut with signs of a great talent. And then ""Amen"" got released. Instead of making a second This Fire, she chooses a very different musical direction. This record is more about freedom and spirituality, with a more rythm and blues sounding band. Paula Cole's voice is still the driving pulse on this cd, with some guest appearances from Tionne Watkins (from TLC) and DJ Premier who adds some scratches.The only problem I have with this cd are the lyrics. Sometimes Paula tries to much to convince us with her believes (that's her good right) but I prefer the emotional statements from This Fire."
3,"Beautiful sounding, lyricly adolescent.","I was disappointed with Paulas new offering. While the production values remain high, the lyrical content slides too much to the ""Jewel"" side of the scale. I admire Paula in her ability to sing what she feels, no one currently has a more promising voice, but the lyrics are something that my teenage sister would write. Missing this time around is the subtlety of her previous angst ridden albums, its unfortunate that bombast has replaced the beauty of her other 2 albums. While her last album was spectacular this one falls way short, it makes me wish she had some editorial help. Oh well back to ""This Fire"" until the next album."
1,Fire is replaced by banal preaching,"I loved the cd ""This Fire"". The songs are without flaw. I thought I had discovered a new musical ""idol"". I have long been a Genesis and Peter Gabriel fan. When I saw his name aphixed to the cd, I gave it a try. I discovered a selection of songs that exceeded anything Gabriel has ever done. So I went out and purchased ""Amen"" without a thought. I was a little leery when I detected the spiritual bend (being agnostic myself), but I have listened to many artists decree there spiritual growth and still maintain artistic integrity. (early Bruce Cockburn comes to mind). I was sadly disappointed. Ms. Cole seems so focused on the words, that the music is hardly considered. Where ""This Fire"" was totally solid, Amen is very week. Words seem to be cramped into hurried melodies. There are still moments when her marvelous voice is tested, but her song writing talents are lost. I hope she has expunged the need to decree her spiritual dictates. I am very disappointed."
1,Regretable Misstep From Rising Talent,"The talent is there, and the spirit is willing but the material is untempered and otherwise over-the-top, lacking the mature vision the moment demanded. Truth is, the people around Cole should never have let her issue this overripe execution of underdone fare. A live album with some stronger new material (and cool covers), followed by a studio work with a more grounded and humble perspective on herself and the world would still be the wisest course. Live, learn from mistakes, do better next time; that's the artistic process."
2,Kinda disappointing follow-up to This Fire,I was disappointed at this album. It seems the FIRE has burnt out. It's way too mellow for me.
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"After listening to Paula's previous album endlessly for two years, I was really looking forward to her new release. But after hearing it, I was terribly disappointed. None of the songs are even worth listening to again."
1,What a let down!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sorry Paula this one is a disapointment. I always hate when artist start taking themselves to seriously and Amen is full of that. I hoped for more ""fire"" and got a trip to church!"
4,This is a great album!I'm a new fan of hers!,"I'm not sure why there were such passionately negative reviews from her supposed fans! I've never bought any of her albums before, but I saw her at Hard Rock Live a month ago and she was INCREDIBLE!I bought the album soon after.Amen,I believe in love, and I wanna be somebody are amazing songs.And as for her R&B dabblings, I love it.The band is amazingly tight and I think she's just being true to her artistry and trying new things."
1,zero stars!,most of the good reviews I've read are from people who don't want to beleive this album is rotten. I would bet anything they don't listen to it more than 10 times and put this fire back in the cd changer!
5,Boldly courageous,"I disagree with most of the other reviewers in saying that this CD was a disappointment. I found it to be highly emotional and filled with heart. I love love love both her other albums (Harbinger being the best of the 3 in my opinion). I thought that ""Amen"" was exceptional and very courageous. She did take another turn and I found it refreshing that she wasn't afraid of sale dips when she openly expressed her views on spirtuality. That can be a very difficult turn for ""secular"" musicians to do after such great album sales. I commend her and don't believe for a minute that her heart and soul wasn't completely in every song. Kudos to Paula Cole and looking forward to the next CD and what she will do with that one."
1,Doesn't compare to This Fire,"After listening to Amen I would think twice about purchasing another Paula Cole CD. I was extremely disappointed in the Amen CD considering I loved This Fire. It doesn't appear that Paula Cole is writing songs that the same audience would appreciate. In addition, a lot of the words of the songs are barely audible making listening to the words in your car, let alone anywhere else, practically impossible."
4,Paula shows her broad range,"I didn't know what to expect; Harbinger had to grow on me, and I loved most of This Fire, and I knew that Paula had more to show stylistically. This she does; she teams up with T-Boz, she combines what we might call her ""style"" with R&B, rap, and a little funk. It's so refreshing to see an artist who isn't restricted to sounding the same on every album..."
3,Where has Paula gone?,"Like many of the other reviewers, I too anticipated Paula's latest album. As I listen to the CD, I hear Paula changing and maturing, but instead of writing about this maturation and herself, Amen focuses on others. What I love about This Fire and Harbinger is that Paula writes so intimately about herself and her experience. When listening to her first albums, I wonder how she can share such intimacy with people she will never know. But, Amen has lost this intimacy. Except for track 4, she writes about others and their own struggles. yeah, her voice is still fantastic, the musical aspects are interesting, and she writes about important issues, but where has Paula gone?"
2,"Paula, Stick with what you know.....","""Amen"" equals ""Ouch"". Paula, if it ain't broke don't fix it.....This departure into soul/r&b/rap stinks on ice. You are an exquisite vocalist and writer,,,,why have you taken the low road and produced such a typical sound on this new cd? You have been an extraordinary new force on the music scene since ""Harbinger"" and I have been a fan since day one, seeing you perform live in tiny venues such as Philadelphia's Tin Angel before no one knew your name.....and now with the success of ""This Fire""s"" worst song...""I don't want to wait"" you continue the popsy, common sound on ""Amen"". Yuck. This schlock belongs on AM radio.....'nuff said."
2,Rush Job,"You would think in the CD age, a person could afford to put more than 9 songs on a CD. This is obviously a rush job for Paula, and a ripoff for anyone who pays full price for this CD. Not to mention, of the nine songs, there are only a few choice cuts on the CD to choose from. The opening track ""I Believe in Love"" is the real highlight of the album, although the lyrics sound a bit lame. Whatever Paula is going through right now personally, I can respect, but this CD really underlies her talent."
1,"Paula, What Happened?","I would most certainly consider myself a BIG Paula Cole fan. I would consider Amen to be a BIG Paula Cole disapointment. This CD completely lacks the passion that fills her other musical efforts. I would even go so far as to say that this CD is not even worthy of a third listen. I listened twice to make sure I wasn't missing something. I wasn't. Hey, I know that not every CD by an artist will hit a home run. This one doen't even make it off the bench."
4,I loved this CD!,"In moments of creativity, you can only hope to put as much of yourself as possible in your work. That's what Paula Cole has achieved with ""Amen"". In this eclectic mix of funk, pop tunes, and bluesy numbers, you not only hear and feel her struggle for love, inner peace, political righteousness, and a life of spiritual meaning - you want it too. Honestly, there are a few ""fillers"" in the album, hence the 4 star rating. But with evocative tracks such as ""I Believe in Love"", ""Amen"", ""Pearl"" and ""Be Somebody"", these ""fillers"" are forgiven. In short, Paula Cole offers a musical reflection of herself and ourselves as well in our struggle for harmony in our personal relationships, our humanitarian responsibility in the world, and our spiritual balance in the universe."
4,Amen For Paula,"I really liked this CD. You really can't expect Paula to want to duplicate the same style as she did on 'This Fire' do you? I loved about 6 songs of the 9 on the cd. The songs are long enough to make up for the low number. I didn't feel she was preaching, only showing her spiritual side. Her voice is soothing and comforting. Now, it all depends on which mood I'm in and which of her cd's I'll listen to at that time. I loved This Fire. I want to buy Harbinger next. Anyone who loves Paula Cole's voice should buy this cd."
3,Fine.,"Well, It seems to me that PAULA COLE has grown up a bit since ""This Fire"". When I first listened to ""Amen"" the music sounded ""Hippie-Like"" and very naive. After Listening to this album carefully, and especially to songs like ""La Tonya"" and ""Free"" I realized that the lyrics are hypnotizing and there is a lot of meaning in them. I almost believed her. I consider this cd as a good atmosphere cd, especially for dusk (preferably if you have a sea-view)."
3,Flames are dying,"I have admired Paula Cole ever since I discovered her. She has real talent: not only in her lyrics and ear for production, but in her magnificent voice. For some reason, Ms Cole. has tamed this vocal fire WAY down. I can live with that. I don't have any problem with her embracing a more 'black' style of music; it's a shock, but one I know I'll get used to. We're fine, so far. The problem is, her lyrics are nowhere near as powerful or strong as on such songs as ""Chiarascuro"" or ""Our Revenge"" or ""Tiger."" Half the time she is as good as before, but on too many places she gets self-important. (This is her one flaw, which brought the only weak moment to her otherwise stellar last album, This Fire) This is a good record, of course, but from Paula Cole we should have expected better than this. Really."
2,"Paula Cole finds God, loses music. . .","If Whitney Houston was backed up by the theme from ""Shaft"" you'd have Paula's new sound. . .it's new, it's old, it's very odd, and it's not much like the wonderful and idiosyncratic set of previous CD's she's done. I'm waiting for the next one and hoping that her original, erotic and beautiful voice and song writing style return."
3,too bad......the fire just went out.....,"I was a fan when I heard This Fire. Totally loved it, still do. I also loved Harbinger, the first album. But this album caused Paula to fall from my favourite artists list...... This Fire was much much much more challenging.I'm sorry Paula......this just doesn't seem like you.....I mean, She used to have great lyrics (they are still okay on this album, but not that special) and she used to make music that just grabbed hold of your heart and tore it out.....These songs all seem to sound like eachother. DOn't get me wrong, it's a nice album, but no more than that.....nice..... SHe could have done so much better...."
1,Tori and Sarah do it better...,"What can i say besides ""yuck""? i loved ""This Fire"", but ""Amen"" definitely does not meet the same standard of quality. Let's face it though, Paula will never surpass her other female peers such as Tori Amos or Sarah Mclachlan in terms of music or lyrics. Go buy Mirrorball or To Venus And Back. One reviewer below said that Paula had more to offer than songs for a Dawson's Creek soundtrack...Well, i agree, she does have more to offer. Unfortunately, nobody wants it!"
1,Big Disappointment,"I'll keep this short...like the length of time that I owned this album before selling it back to a local CD store. One customer who previously reviewed this album on Amazon.com said it best: ""What is this, Christian Rock?"" I own the 2 previous albums by Paula Cole, and this third one absolutely stinks--it's whiney, has too many religious undertones, is often very cheesy and sadly mainstream--Which is why you'll find it typically on most of your ""Top 40's Hit's"" Radio stations--right along with Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears."
1,What is this? Christian rock?,"I didn't expect an album called ""Amen""-especially coming from Paula Cole-to LITERALLY be filled with God-speak and dull lyrics. ""I want to be somebody...for we all are children of the father"" or ""I wanna be free"" sounds like something from ""We are the world"". Too many songs on this album are dragging, simplistic, and preachy. I'm going to the CD exchange place as soon as possible. I give one star for ""I Believe in Love"", the only song with potential on the album, although it, too, lacks originality."
1,"Oh, please go away......","Paula Cole is easily one of the most overrated performers of the past decade. Her voice is weak, her production is sloppy, ""Where have All the Cowboys Gone"" has some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever heard, and if I have to hear ""I Don't Want to Wait"" once more I will throw myself in front of a bus. As part of my job, I had to review the ""Amen"" CD. I couldn't listen to it all the way through. Simply awful, pretentious and preachy. And it is a complete flop, both critically and commercially. Maybe now we will never have to hear her again. Now, if the same thing would only happen to Jewel....."

1,Paula Morissette?,"This is Ms. Cole's worst offering. I totally loved ""This Fire"" and most of ""Harbringer"". This album is laced with Mariah Carey sounding vocals (who's doing the high stuff? - NOT Ms. Cole), Alanis 90's disco grooves, and Dr. Dre sounding beats. Her lyrics I might give 2 stars to, but there very self-centered and pretentious most of the time. This was a drag becuase I have been a fan of Paula's since her days with Peter Gabriel - but this ""Amen"" album is terrible. I was totally dissapointed. Thanks for selling out, Paula."
1,"C'mon Paula, get it together","This album was a total diappointment, with a capital D. There are a few songs that are OK-like Pearl and Amen-but adding hip-hip and rap styles to this album was a definite MISTAKE. I personally abhor rap and hip-hop, so naturally this album was a waste of money for me. I wouldn't have given it even one star, but there were no other choices. If you like rap and hip-hop, then you will be pleased with Paula's transitions here. I hope she departs from the style of this album is she produces any more."
2,problems,"i bought one of these fans last year on sale and thought it was okay, my son bought us another one and it smelled like it was burning up each time we turned it on, it finally stopped smelling, runs alright. but not worth the full price."
2,do not believe whisper-quiet operation,The fan is not whisper quiet. i.e. if your watching TV and you turn on the fan you will have to increase the volume several notches. You will eventually go deaf with the high volume of the TV and the loudness of the fan in its lowest setting Look elsewhere for a whisper -quiet fan. I will be returning this one. If you anyone has any suggestions for a whisper silent fan please let me know. thx
4,Vornado 733B High Velocity air circulator,I am amazed that this small air circulator had really kept my small house cool this summer. I have other fans in different areas of the house and none of them can do the job of the Vornado. I would highly recommend it. MDH
2,"Works, but it's overpriced and much louder than I expected","I expected more from this product.It does move a fair amount of air, but it's far too loud at all settings. At the lowest setting, calling it 'whisper quiet' is a joke.It is solidly built for a plastic fan, but it hardly merits the price. It only has a handful of settings/adjustments. Vornado must be making a TON of money on each fan."
4,"Works Well, but..","I agree Vornado fans are not made as they used to be ~10 years ago, but I think they are still one of the best on the market.This fan worked well, but it would make the entire house smell like burning plastic. So I returned the first and am breaking in the second one now, luckily no smell yet. Hope it stays that way!"
1,sucks,overrated fan. just go to lowes or home depot and save money and get something you can return in person.
5,You get what you pay for,"This fan (air circulator) is convenient to use and solidly built. It moves the air quite well and most importantly, it is QUIET. While there are certainly less expensive ""simple"" (i.e. no timer, non-oscillating etc) fans on the market, if you want a work-horse, this is a good one. We have 6 of them in our office areas. They have run non-stop for 2 years. We still can't hear the motor in any of them. We just bought 3 more for co-workers on another floor."
3,Stand and Deliver!,This fan is basically fine. I have two other Vornado fans and I like them better. The stand on this model has a cheap feel and that puts me off. I guess the stand will last the life of the fan ... but in my experience Vornado fans are great and that might be a long time. I wish they had put a little more time into the feeling you get when you move it or pick it up. I'm sure its fine but it isn't what I expected.
4,"A bit noisy, but moves a LOT of air","I use two of these to help ventilate an art studio, and to stay cool at home with less A/C. They move a ton of air. The only down side is that they are a bit noisy, but I don't know if that can be avoided when you're moving so much air."
4,Great Fan,I use this to push air down from my vaulted ceiling... this fan has been running 24/7 since it arrived!It is quiet enough... and certainly powerful enough to circulate the air even on low speed.
3,Still a great fan... but they took away full aim!,"This is basically an update of the great 723/723B Vornado fan. But, while that model had the standard ""tubular"" style base that allowed full aiming, this model only has three positions! That's what I call a downgrade! -2 stars for that! :("
4,Great Fan!,"I have multiple of these fans now and have to say that I am impressed. I was a little worried about how effective this product would be at the price but I took plunge! After reading an in-depth review on Vornado 733b at geekmontage, I was instantly sold. This fan doesn't help every room but it doesn't, no fan will. I recommend this fan to anyone. Try it out! You'll be impressed."
5,Vornado does it again!,"Vornado is an amazing company! Although much pricier than the other fans, it is well worth the money if you need something that's going to last. The 3 fan speeds are perfect and quiet. The unit does not shake or rattle like most other fans. My in-laws bought us our first Vornado over 14 years ago and it is going strong. We decided to add another fan to our household and were so thrilled that we stayed with Vornado! This fan is awesome!"
2,"Nice and bright, but short life.","Well after my left low beam head light burned out after 100,000 miles, I did some quick research. I decided to buy the Sylvania 9006 ST head light since I thought it was a descent product based on brightness and effective lighting. Unfortunately it only lasted about 20,000 miles. I properly installed it without touching the bulb or bumping anything. Just like playing a game of Operation. Although the bulb is bright and clear, I'm very disappointed with it's life performance. :("
4,Good,"This product was great for the price at the time, but considering I changed just one headlight, when I turn both on, I do see the difference in the intensity of light. Otherwise, works nice for the past few months."
5,Very Helpful Techiques,"I've had trouble falling asleep for a long time and recently got this CD after deciding to quit relying on the help of sleeping pills. Dr. Shapiro's relaxation techniques are excellent and have helped me to relax and fall asleep without the use of sleep aids. More importantly, I learned her relaxation techniques after listening to the CD several times and am now able to use them to fall asleep on my own. I now know that I can use these techniques to fall asleep no matter where I am or what kind of day I've had, and any time I need a little extra help I play the CD and am asleep in no time."
4,has helped many times,"I recommend the use of the this CD for chronic insomnia and not acute. It does help the mind relax if that has kept you up at night like me. I have my acute insomnia under control with herbs, vitamins and acupuncture. Playing this CD when I first get in bed helps the best as opposed to using it later in the night when I realize I am in a funk and cannot get to sleep. I also use earplugs that allow me to hear my heart beat and breathing taking my mind of stresses that can keep me awake."
3,The Calming Collection - Sleep Solutions. ** Guided meditation for restful sleep,"At the time I bought this CD I also bought the ""Sleep Easy: Guided Meditation for Deep Rest"" CD. I like the ""Sleep Easy"" better. Maybe it's just me, but sometimes I get so wrapped up trying to follow meditation instructions perfectly that I actually get more tense. The ""Sleep Easy"" tape is so loose there's nothing to trigger that tension creating desire to ""do it correctly."""
5,Thanks!,Great product - gifted to my mom and she loves it. Case was cracked when I received it though
3,Distracting voice,"I have to say that I found her voice to be abrasive. Also, she had a way of repeating suggestions that I found so distracting and cheesy that it made it hard for me to get into the CD. The positives are that she does try a wide variety of techniques, so perhaps if one didn't work another might. But I found her voice and style so distracting that it didn't work for me at all."
4,pls help,"I have a question for all who is using these CDs. I have had insomnia for 20 yrs. I want to ask what do I do if I fall asleep during/after the playing of the CD? The ipod or the lights on my CD player will wake me up after a couple of hrs, no? Do you all have a solution/answer? thanks so much"
2,Not very helpful,"I had such high hopes when I read all the great reviews for this cd, and after giving it too many tries, I am terribly disappointed. (I'm the type of insomniac that falls asleep easily, but after 4 or 5 hours, wakes up continuously. I also need earplugs, so even if this cd was starting to work, I still have to sit up, turn it off, put in earplugs, and try to fall asleep again).Shapiro's repetitive instructions just annoy me (I heard you the first time!), and tracks 3 and 4 (to lull you back to sleep after you've woken up) were much too short and hard to visualize. As track 2 progresses, her voice gets too soft to hear, making me strain to hear it and waking up again.I give it 2 stars because I like her mind-clearing technique; I use it along with some mini-moves from ""The Insomnia Solution,"" a book that's finally helping me calm my mind and get some rest. Forget the cd and try the book."
5,extremely calming,I love the cd collection! It helps me unwind and relax and fall into a peaceful sleep.
5,Best way to fall asleep,As a decorator I am always thinking about my projects. When I hear this CD and Roberta's soothing voice my stress goes down and I feel peace wash over me. Not just me but my ten year old son loves it!Tamara RothKreative Makeovers
2,Not impressed,"I'm an insomniac as well as a multiple waker every single night. I bought this cd in the hopes that I wouldn't need to take a heavy dose of sleeping pills every night to get to sleep. It didn't work for me. her voice is too loud for me, there is no soothing quality about it at all. repeating the same words over and over didn't do much for me either. I am very disappointed in this cd and definitely wouldn't recommend it."
5,Works wonders!,"Such a great CD. After years of having sleep problems, a friend recommended a few CDs and this is the one that did the trick!! Buy it! You wont regret it!"
5,Finally some sleep!,I put this in the first night....I didnt even realize i had fallen asleep. I woke up refreshed and amazed at how easy I had fallen asleep. My husband has also listened to it with mix reviews! 4 me ..I LUV IT!
5,so happy to be sleeping now,I am reaaly happy I bought this CDi've tried a few others that I didnt like but this CD I love!!!I use it not just for sleepingI take it with me whenever I need to relax the doctor dentist airplaneits a GREAT CDbeth
5,worked very well,I listen to this cd every evening and I get a much deeper night's sleep. I wake up feeling more rested and don't feel as sleepy during the day as I did prior to using it. I highly recommend its use for anyone who has sleeping difficulties.
1,really disappointed,"Really disappointed in this given the strong reviews. Not enough direction, basically a disembodied voice telling you to clear your mind, sweep thoughts away, think of sunsets and beaches .. but not much direction as to how. If it was that easy to clear one's mind, we'd all be sleeping. The main track was not long enough to put me to sleep and having to get up to increase the volume on the last two tracks destroyed any beneficial effects from the first tracks. The volume drop on the subsequent tracks, with the stated intention to not disturb you if you are sleeping after the first one, doesn't work if you're not, makes it impossible to use the tracks consecutively."
5,"Awesome ""Sleep Solution""!!","I often have trouble falling and staying asleep. This CD is amazing. Miss Roberta's voice is very soothing. I use to rely on sleep medication for a long time. I'm happy to say....I am totally free from that. I highly recommend anyone who has problems falling asleep, staying asleep or even relaxing...buy this CD! It is a must have! I'm getting some for friends and family for Christmas!"
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I read some very good reviews regarding this product, but it really didn't work for me. I found that I had to do too much visualization while trying to get to sleep. After a week I decided that I needed less of the meditation and more of the hypnosis. I'm sure it works differently for each person, but didn't work for me."
2,Sound volume is an issue,I think the CD is great except. . .the last two tracks are so low that I can't hear them at all when I have the volume set for the first two. It's a pain to have to get out of the relaxed state to have to turn up the sound to get back to a relaxed state.--Something wrong with their planning.
4,I really like her voice,"I have fibro and have so much trouble sleeping. I have purchased many cd's and wasted money but I like this one. Her voice is very soothing, not annoying like some. The only thing I don't like is that she gets quieter and quieter toward the ending of the cd and I can bearly hear her over my fan. I think she lowers her voice for different segments of the cd, I wish it was all the same volume."
3,sleep video,"I ordered this for my husband, who has insomnia. On the CD, the voice leading you through the relaxation gradually becomes softer and softer with the thinking I suppose that the listener would have drifted off to sleep by the time the voice became inaudible. But my husband found that he would strain to hear the voice as the volume became lower, which brought him out of the relaxed state. He tried it a few times, and it didn't work for him."
2,Not satisfied,"I didn't enjoy it, she's talking to low for you to hear. I'm using it for trying to get to sleep, and I can't understand what she's saying, so therefore, I have to get up and turn the volume up on some of the tracks."
5,Sleeping Med. free,"Changed my life;this was the best option to getting a restful nights sleep with out medication.I have lived with sleeping medication for the last ten years.Now I sleep soundly after just listening to the calming voice of Roberta.Thanks,a real life saver.Shraga"
5,Recommended Highly,"I recommend this CD for Everyone-people trying to sleep, or just relax, adults, children, fearful people with anxiety and fearful fliers. It is the best CD of it's kind I have ever listened to. The narrators voice is superb and it really does the job. A resounding five stars! Kelly Austin Atlanta, Georgia"
3,It is hit and miss,"Sleep solutions works OK for me some of the time. But if corny is not your thing then it may not be for you. ""Transported on the wings of serenity?"" Huh? What does that even mean? And ""my own magical sleeping place"" sounds ridiculous to me.That said, her voice is soothing and some of the guided relaxation exercises are nice.But the Signal Breath? It doesn't signal me to do anything. There is a huge gap between when she tells you to breath in and when she says to breath out. I can't hold it that long and I end up taking several breaths and feel like I am doing it wrong.Finally, at the end she tells you that you are now asleep. If you are not asleep, all that does is irritate and annoy. Tell me I'm relaxed by all means, but don't tell me I'm asleep! If I'm asleep I won't be listening to you anyway. If I'm awake then it will be annoying to hear."
3,The Calming Collection - Sleep Solutions,"The first selection on this CD is very relaxing and helpful in getting to sleep. Unfortunately, the second and third selections require an adjustment of the volume control which is annoying."
1,Disappointing,"It might have been the voice (which IMO was not gentle/comforting), the accompanying music or the whole presentation, but I found myself more awake at the end of her presentation than before."
5,I love the music,It is very calming and it takes the tension of the day away. I am at peace when I drift off to sleep.
5,"Works great, for awhile...",This was my first guided imagery experience and I tried two others that fell way short of this one. I'd still like to find several others to use so I don't get bored with just this one. Stay away from the alien robot lady and the guy with an English accent. I find that the effect seems to wear off after repeated listenings but I slept great for a week.
2,Please warn us before,"This cd isn't axactly what I was expecting. While the music and sounds played on the disc are what I was looking for, I was most certainly not expecting Roberta Shapiro herself to be giving instructions on what you should be doing. I found her to be very distracting. I will not be buying any more of her cd's."
3,Earphones,"People,I've never heard this particular CD, but I do own others that I like, and you must wear earphones to benefit from this CD or any other meditation type CD. If you choose not to wear earphones, you should try something different.Thanks"
3,A good evening's read,"This is a fairly short book, which means some limitations in character development. However, Ms. Bishop manages to pack a great deal of both plot and suspense into this short space. The strong points are watching the main character evolve from a gauche girl to a young woman whose dreams are beginning to come true; and a story that keeps you engaged and guessing. I read almost all in a single sitting, though I didn't intend to.The one negative point is that the book was written when the double standard for men and women was alive and well, and it forms one of the central points of the story. The unfairness of it kept me gritting my teeth. Other than that I enjoyed it, although the character of the Vicar's wife is perhaps a little overdrawn."
5,2nd review,The DVD arrived promptly and is a good lesson for children on why you should not cheat but be honest in your dealings with others
3,3-2-1 Penguins 2: Not nearly as good as 1st or 3rd,"It's me, StoryMaker. So far we've watched 3 Penguin vedios, episodes 1, 2, and 3. We got em' all from the library, so far we own no Penguin vedios. This is sorta good, but my review for #1 reached 5 stars. This one had 5, but 2 of them fell off because it is my least favorite of 1, 2, and 3 episodes. The only good thing is Michelle, the funny landing gear and the cute Bandicoot king (who sounds like a queen, female) and silly red things the penguins get the ware. It has a false-advertisment box, the pic on the front makes it looks like only Midgel is captured. The back, well, false ad pic of Squid-Tac-Toad because they do not have red things on them and it just looks like life-sized Tic-Tac-Toe. Signed, StoryMaker. ""Gotta trust the kid's review!"""
4,"Excellent, but original edition better.","An outstanding expedition into the power of emotions and the internal struggles faced by Lew Alton in returning home to his native Darkover. The author has ""tidied up"" a number of time lines from the original publication. However, I found the original to be both more enjoyable and imaginative. While the reader can understand the desire of Ms. Bradley to have her work reflect a more mature self, the naivete of Lew and Marjorie is exchanged for a less dedsirable physical lust. While both versions entertain, and are excellent presentations of the Darkover venue, the original holds a special place in my childhood memories."
5,Shimmering power-pop with a pedigree,"Members of the Doughboys and Big Drill Car? How could this album NOT kick a$$?!?!? ""All I Want"" is one of the finest pop songs ever recorded. Period. Watch for them on the Warped Tour. Do yourself a favor while you're at Amazon, pick up anything still available by the Doughboys or Big Drill Car!"
3,Better than nothing,"This album is ok. Not the best, not the worst. If your expecting it to be like a vintage Big Drill Car album you will be dissapointed. The singing is good and the music is solid pop punk/ rock."
4,First class pristine punk pop,"It had been a long time since I'd heard of anything from the likes of John Kastner from the Doughboys, but that band had been such an influence on me that when I discovered this CD I was in heaven. Vodka Sonic just blew me away and the more I listen to the album the better it sounded. Forget all the purile songs of Blink 182, punk pop has never sounded this good - this album is first class. I can't wait for future releases."
3,Seasoned by Salt,"There are two books in Seasoned by Salt - Jerry's book and Anne' book. Each one contributes to the overall experience of sailing the dream that many of us have. Being an academic, Jerry's book sometimes flounders in invisible footnotes that divert our enthusiasm from the adventure at hand. We are, at times, forced to navigate the geopolitical contours of the Caribbean rather than feeling the trade winds in our sails and finding the right words to make this experience come alive for the reader. Anne's book is more immediate, touching emotions that describe the event allowing us to view the journey through intimate eyes. I would trade hearing more from Anne and less from Jerry's lecture prone prose of ""The Politics of the Caribbean""."
3,Biiiiiiiiig let-down,"RFTP is one of my favorite bands, and I have all his albums on lp and cd. So I was thrilled when I heard about a new album. I ended up very dissapointed. Actually, let me be accurate. The album was OK, with a sort of dark synth-pop type sound, but as a hardcore fan of the old school, I found it weak and not at all of the same quality as his earlier albums. Perhaps my standard of expectation was too high. If you are interested, start with any of the earlier ones; ""We Love the Moon,"" ""In The Sea Of E,"" and so on; they are all terrific."
3,Wasn't his best but wasn't terrible,"Having read David Edding's other nineteen books, I was very excited when I saw High Hunt in print. I bought it on the spot and delved into it. It was interesting enough, but I found the character interactions were a bit predictable, and seemed a little fake, if not overexaggerated. I must say it was interesting to read my second non-fantasy book by Eddings, but I think he should stick to maces and maidens. But then again, this was his first work, so maybe after reading Polgara I was expecting too much. Worth your time and money, but hardcore Eddings fans may be a little disappointed."
2,High Hunt by David Eddings,"Not a too great book, at least not nearly as good as""The Malloreon"", ""Elenium"" or ""Tamuli"" which are all very good books. Very exiting and reads easy!"
1,Waste Of Money!,"A lot of the book was based on any breed. In the training section, it was hard to understand what they were saying. I own two Chis of my own and thier behavior was not as nearly bad as the book described the attitude! I might as read a book about German Shepards!"
2,Maybe Nice Enough For Beer,"I purchased this for a special occaision and am sending it back because it's just not nice enough.The problem is the little handles on the side. The bucket itself, while thin, is nice and shiny. The little handles look like cheap tin that was spot welded on spoling the whole effect.If they made it without the little rings, I would have kept it."
5,Greatness!,My dog recently went blind so I needed to find some toys that made noise. This toy is GREAT! Believe it or not I did a lot of research online trying to find the perfect toy that my dog couldn't tear up in seconds and this one is good quality. My dog loves it so much that I might end up buying more.
3,This is for tiny dogs?,"I have small dogs, meaning they weigh under 12 pounds. This ball is as big as my chihuahua's head. I'm not kidding. The ball would be perfect, but she can't even pick it up (though she tries), so I must give a giant thumbs down due to ridiculous mislabeling. However, if your dog is medium to large, he or she will love the bell, bounciness (not sure if that is a word..) and ridges for gripping."
3,it will work,"The ball was exactly what I was looking for, except it is very heavy for it's size. My puppy is only 3 pounds (will get to 8 or so) and picking it up is a problem. He prefers the light weight plastic ones made for cats. I do like how sturdy this one is though."
5,Excellent Trim Saw,"This is one of the finest trim saws I have ever used. It has a very thin kerf and is very accurate. It cuts on the pull stroke which takes a little getting used to, but once you do I found this saw much easier to use and to start a cut. Everyone that has borrowed my saw says that they have to get one for themselves. I don't think anyone would be disappointed with this saw."
5,Great Saw,"This saw is great! I received 3 Veritas dovetail saws the day before this one came in. If this saw had a pretty wood handle, it would rate right there with them. It cuts a straight, fine kerf with little effort and you have great control over the line it is sawing. I don't know if they make a better saw for dovetails or not, but this one works pretty darn good."
4,Good. Not as good as Trek!,"This was a good film. Makes me wanna go on a long distance bike ride. However, it was not as well done as their first film, Trek. Too short and it didn't seem to explore the participants as well as Trek (except for the 15-year old; his story had good depth and was interesting). Overall, though, if you like long adventures, biking, or just have wanderlust, you should enjoy this film."
4,Interesting look at bicycle touring,"I bought this DVD last year expecting more of a documentary about loaded touring from an outsiders point of view. Instead, the narration and storytelling is done by actual group members. It gives you an inside view of the chemistry of a group as they go on a long journey by bike. The way it is done, you sort of feel like you are a part of the group.The scenery is incredible. It makes you anxious for the warm weather to return so you can hop on your bike and experience as much of the country as possible. I say ""experience the country"" because that is what happens when you ride a bicycle rather than drive a car. In a car, you are just trying to get somewhere. On a bike, you become a part of the journey, and that is one of the things these guys show you through their own journey.I am planning my own journey/loaded bicycle tour along a portion of the same route for the Summer of 2006 and this film has definitely helped me through the long winter."
5,Inspiring!,"I had to get this after I saw their first documentary on hiking the Appalachain Trail, ""TREK"" . That was amazing in and of itself, but they have gone leaps and bounds above that documentary in terms of production and presentation. This truly engaging and inspiring DVD chronicles their bike trip all across the United States over the course of one summer. They are a rare group of souls who truly follow their dreams, and have been courteous enough to share their adventures with the rest of us. I highly recommend this DVD. It makes me want to get out and see the world. You will be inspired!"
1,Incorrect Listing,"I received a CD with 11 tracks, not the 12 tracks AS LISTED. Of course, the missing track is why I ordered this CD in the first place. I will be keeping it, because I like Lauren Christy, but this discrepancy needs to be addressed. I can see in the reviews that I am not the only person this has happened to."
3,"If you like Breed, then don't get this CD","It's Heather Nova without the soul. Breed is one of those CDs I won't leave home without. I have had it for years and never gotten a bit tired of it. So I thought this was a sure bet. The edginess is there, but the delivery just wasn't developed yet and it comes off as bland. There are so many feelings there, but they don't hit like in Breed. The true test of an ablum, for me, is how long it takes me to start singing along to it. Though I've tried to get into this one, I just can't do it. My advice would be to listen to a couple of tracks off it first, but definately don't think you know what to expect out of Lauren Christy without hearing anything off the CD.I guess it's all a matter of taste. Breed is my taste, this is not. I have to give her some credit because so many artists go along without ever evolving."
5,Replacing a CD that my EX stole from me,"I would describe her voice as a mellower, smoother Tori Amos with a unique accent.liked her voice, music was okay too.price was right, so I bought it again."
1,Don't do it.,"When I built my computer, I was stupid and wanted it to be obnoxiously illuminated and filled with cathode lights and LED's and EL wire. I regret all that now, and I also regret this mouse pad. It's bulky but provides little room, the colors are a stupid novelty that wear off after a day or two, and it absolutely kills teflon feet."
1,Made a mistake trying to save some money!,"This product is OK for letter writing or documents if you're not printing a photo. I wouldn't buy it again. I make cards with prints and photos and never had this problem. I get green were there is no green in the print or Photo. I have to put my printer on Heavy Ink so I don't get white lines on the matte pages. Go to Staples and buy Lexmark 34 & 35 for high yield ink if it goes with your printer model. Staples won't charge you for shipping, at least not today. So far on my search, they are the only ones that have a reasonable price in the combo pack & singles. I do recommend the products that come with your printer. I like the high yield because 95% of my prints come out flawlessly. I am always searching for better paper and ink and comparing their prices from one store to the other. Amazon does sell ""Lexmark"" ink, but they do not sell #35, otherwise, I'd probably buy it from here. Hope they do one of these days."
5,I received this from my girlfriend for my birthday and love it. ”,"For it's price it cannot be beat! Overall, easily worth the price and the five star rating I gave it. I would also go as far to say this is the best"
5,Still shines,"One of the best second tier ""Manchester""/Britpop releases of the 90's....the era of artists like Northside, The Wendys, The Real People, The Mock Turtles....Its a CD that still continues to impress me. The Dylans just seem to nail the everything about music in this vein, funky drumming, wah wah guitars, hammond organ, great lead vocals and terrific choruses.Things start out a a roll with ""She Drops Bombs"" a swirling blissed out drumming track. ""Planet Love"" keeps things rolling right along. ""Sad Rush on Sunday"" is majestic. One of the hidden gems here is ""Ocean Wide"", great organ work and percussion. The pounding ""Godlike"" is my favorite track. Things just don't slow down after that with ""Mary Quant in Blue"" thru ""Indian Sun"".Toss in some utterly first rate production by Stephen Street and John A. Rivers and you have pretty much a defining piece of the early 90s sound."
3,Enjoyable,"I have read several of Georgette Heyer's books and I think this was my favorite. I don't like when reviews go on and on, so just let me say this: A light read, read the whole book today. It think it was the characters I liked best. Enjoy!"
4,Faro's Daughter,"Faro's Daughterby Georgette HeyerExtremely well written. Historically accurate in detail of clothes, houses, means of tranport and manners and engaging"
5,Laughed til I cried,"Having previously read at least 9 or 10 Georgette Heyer Regency books and loving them all, I was still not prepared for the laugh out loud surprises that Faro's Daughter brought forth. I litereally laughed til tears were running down my cheeks at the antics of the combating hero and heroine. These two strong personalities were combustible both verbally and physically and upon finishing it the first time, I immediately read it again. I would love this book to be made into a movie. I can picture one of my favorite British actors (RA) as Ravenscar. There is so much witty reparte, humor, drama and romance that I put Faro's Daughter on my wish list. I don't mind borrowing from the library, but I want to own my favorites so I can grab them anytime I want to be transported. Asking someone to pick their favorite Georgette Heyer is like asking them to pick their favorite child. This one is definately a keeper."
3,Underdeveloped,"I discovered Georgette Heyer on an ""If you like Jane Austen you'll like..."" list. Faro's Daughter falls very short of Austen quality!The hero, Ravenscar, spends 99% of the book trying to prevent his cousin from marrying Deborah Grantham because she is considered an unsuitable bride for a member of the ""ton"". Although he finally discovers that she is not the ""harpy"" that he originally believed, the actual interaction between the two protagonists is so little that a love match at the end is wholly unbelievable. In addition, a great portion of the book is wasted due to repetition and unnecessary conversations between Deborah and supporting characters.One redeeming quality is that there are sections that are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny, however, not enough to make it much more than unsubstantial and dull."
1,Shame on Amazon for selling such a poorly proofed Kindle edition!,"I downloaded the sample to read before buying this book, and found two 'typos' in the first two pages. Why should Amazon recieve $7.99 for a book that they have zero investment in, and nobody to pay royalties to? To issue these shoddy digital editions is terribly disrespectful to the author's memory."
5,Pharo's Daughter Deals a Delightful Hand!,"Another delightfully fun read from Georgette Heyer!My mother was a Jane Austen fan, but dear Jane wrote only SIX novels.Not our marvelous Georgette! She was prolific. And Ms. Heyer's historical research into the social aspects of the Regency era shine through all her books.In Pharo's Daughter, there is this scene. They are going to the Theatre in a box. Her ensemble. Her dress, her accessories, her whole manner are pointedly dreadful. When I read it, I cackled and a guffawed out loud for such an extended period of time that my sister finally just had me read her the scene aloud.This is a love story of opposites attracting in the milieu of Beatrice and Benedict.Georgette Heyers make for marvelous Summer Beach reading or something to nibble on in the Winter chill on the weekend. Pharo's Daughter is totally worth your reading."
5,DELIGHTFUL!!!!!!!!,its a wonderful book and makes for lovely reading. heyer wit and style will keep you entertained from the first page to the last.a must buy for anyone who enjoys heyer style romance.
5,One of my favorite authors,"Faro's Daughter is one of the first I ever read by Georgette Heyer and the first of her books I got to read on Kindle. I love Heyer for her wit and her minor characters who are often very funny. Yet the romance is believable. I wasn't thrilled with the price, but then I hope my Kindle version will last longer than the crumbling paperbacks I have. Can't wait for her best stuff to appear electronically: A Civil Contract, The Grand Sophy, These Old Shades, etc. . ."
5,A Heyer Classic,"This one of the best novels by this superb writer; the characters are both fascinating and delightfully amusing. If you have never read one of these classic romances, prepare to be hooked. Heyer fans are legion and read and reread her works...none of the the so called ""romance novels"" written today can come near to rivaling her books. After all, she founded the genre."
5,Egoyan entering his peak,"Outside of his experiment with Calendar, this was Atom Egoyan entering his mastery of writing and filmmaking with his 1-2 punch of The Adjuster and Exotica.The usual cast is all here: Elias Koteas, Atom's wife, and Maury Chaykin. Similar in thematic content to many of Egoyan's films, Koteas is a man who job forces him to encounter people and families at the moment of crisis. He cannot resist getting involved in their lives to further understand their drives and motivations. At the same time, his wife is a film censor who secretly tapes the movies she screens and brings them home for her sister.Again no one can seem to really speak with each other except in a cursory manner. Instead they rely on these other conventions to communicate. Extremely sad, odd, and relevatory."
2,slow & boring,Incredibly slow build up which manages to spoil the promising points in the movie. A waste of time!
1,horrible,"For the first 30 minutes I was waiting for the story to start, it never did. Then for the next 30 minutes I was waiting for at least something entertaining, anything. Nothing. Then for the last thirty minutes I hoped the movies would end soon.Pity, the movies seemed interesting."
1,Not even good enought for a rental,"All the characters seems to be reading from que cards. Very disappointed with this movie. When the intimate scenes started, it was over within seconds. Feels like a PG-13 B movie. Eventully I fell asleep halfway thru. I'm keeping this movie only for the fact that it'll help me out during the nights that I have trouble sleeping. Don't get burned by this stinker!"
3,Great book; bad kindle formatting,"This book itself is lovely. Unfortunately it has been formatted for kindle in a cheap and careless way. Both on my iPad and kindle, the words on the page are blurry, and then there are typed words written below the page. However, the typed words don't fully match up with the pages to which they relate, and in some cases the same pages show up twice. Unfortunate, because I am sure this could have been easily avoided."
2,Not as good as others,"I'm a librarian so I was really excited to get this book for my daughter, who loves CG (22 months). But, the story is not at all interesting and is too long. When my daughter sees me pull it out, she actually says, ""Bleah."" She might just be too young for it--but she really likes the CG visits the zoo book."
5,Kids love it,Very singable tunes. Keeps kids busy singing along. They ask for this CD all the time. Good purchase for price.
5,Children love these songs.,"I have music classes for children ages 2 to 5 years old. I often have 25 of them at a time. When the children hear Raffi""s voice they are captivated and eager to sing along."
5,Rise and Shine raffi,raffi does not go out of style....I'm now giving his songs to the children of the children I originally gave his music too. They love him!
4,2 Figures,"You actually get 2 droids with this package. You get the one pictured as well as a very basic droid which basically is a treaded base with a stick on top (it reminds me of a Battle Bot). It's not fancy or anything, but my 4 year old was tickled to have 2 droids to play with. The droid pictured has moving legs. There's a button on his side that you press to make his legs walk."
3,Uncle Ted,"Actually, I never heard this album yet, that is why I gave it three stars (not good, not bad), but you need it because Ted Nugent is on it. OK, I gotta go now, I'm gonna buy a copy. Cheap price, too. Gad!"
1,CD is not compatible with my player,"In the excitement of finding this CD, I did not notice that it requires a special player. Upon receiving it and unpacking it I saw the ""super audio player only"" sticker, and thought that my player would be sofisticated enough to be able to handle it. But, NO. I have spoken with friends and professionals and everyone was surprised to hear of my predicament. I would very much like to return this CD for the same title that will play on my player. Since I could not find a customer service site to air my disappointment, I chose this."
2,a travesty to the legend of Mae West,"This book will embarrass the reader, as it is written in such a juvenile manner. All info in it is erroneously written as if it were told directly to the author by Mae West, when in reality it is a simple combination of research taken from several other Mae West bios. The author claims to have been a close personal friend and secretary of Mae Wests, which has since been wildly refuted by readers and many of Wests real secretaries of the time. Some very rare photos, but most can be found in any store on Hollywood Blvd. The book is incredibly over priced as well."
5,get it !,"This is Ben lee at his best, or perhaps I should say his next stage. It seems that his music just goes to higher levels each time he releases another cd. He started with the young and hopeful `grandpaw would', to the broken hearted and liberated `something to remember me by' to the epic and amazing `breathing tornados'; Ben lee now is back with a cd to show all that he's still around, and he's having fun doing it. Ben lee has always come out with a new sound and emotion, and ties it in with a history of brilliance. You will love his new raw outgoing style of `running with scissors' and `dirty mind', then easily reminded of the old Ben with tracks `chills' and `no room to bleed'. If you're a Ben lee fan and you don't have this album...what the hell is wrong with you...and to those who are interested... three things. Get it, love it, live it. Great album."
5,Good good stuff,"Well...I've been into Ben Lee for about six years now and he keeps coming up with some great stuff. It's been really interesting to watch his gradual transition from a Hansonesque teen star to a rambling folk singer to a mature pseudo-techno-laced rock singer. ""Hey you"" is really a great album. I was kind of turned off at first because it seemed Ben's emphasis here was the background beats by Dan the Automator rather than songwriting (his real talent), but all of it gradually grew on me and I realized how great some of these songs are. My favorites are ""Running with Scissors,"" ""Something borrowed somethign blue,"" and the softer songs at the end of the album that are reminiscent of his earlier folkish work."
2,Why the electronics?,"To make this quick and easy - if you want Noise Addict or even his underrated litte-electrified ""SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY"" you won't find it here. If you LOVED TORNADOS, you will probably LOVE this record."
4,A cd well worth your money,"While this may not be the best cd I have ever bought, it is a fine one. It starts off strong with a few good fast songs. Towards the end the songs slowly sober up and concentrate more on melody, harmony, and lyrics rather than beat and tempo. This cd is a strong one and I would recomend it to any fan of indie singer/songwriters. And while I agree that he is no Ben Folds he is up there near him. Go out and this cd, it's a good one."
1,"Big Nose, Hairy Tooth Guy","Ben Lee is funny, you gotta give him that. Running With Scissors is a hilarious song, I laughed so hard when I first heard it. The sad thing is though, I don't think he's trying to be funny. So basically, he sux. The Big Nose Hairy Tooth Guy (inside joke, you wouldn't get it) is back and badder than ever. Literally. Hey is he still dating Claire Danes?"
5,Zoids Rox my Sox OFFFFFFF,Im in highschool now but zoids still rox my sox i pull out my old volume 1 dvd and wacthed it it freaken rules man i am seriouly considering buying more dvds of it even though im in highschool thats how much it rules
4,Perfection,"I, the instant I saw an episode of the Zoid series, thought that it was completely awsome!!! Zoids is 100% better than ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" or ""Pokemon"" or ""Digimon."" It is totally cool. Once you see, it you'll love it."
3,Waiting for my tape!,I cannot write a review as I have not received the tape! It is a gift for a friend so do hope it arrives soon!
5,Nurse Gives Book Thumbs Up!,I have worked extensively with elderly patients and I love this book! It gives seniors great recipes that are easy to prepare and are chock full of nutrition. This book will be very helpful for widowed men with very few cooking skills.This book also addresses various problems that elderly individuals face and gives them tips on how to solve them. Debbie Foray- nurse
3,oops,"I really wanted ""The Little House on the Prarie"" and carelessly ordered this instead. My mistake, but the ""Little Town.."" worked out ok."
1,Abridged Edtion,"I am rating thisbook in reference to the abridged edtion this is. The Laura Ingalls books are classics, and its sad how they are cutting them short in these cheap imitations."
3,Thanks for the confusion!,"As a teacher, I utilize the Little House audiobooks on a regular basis. So far, all of the other audiobooks have been tracked logically, based on chapter. However, the tracks on this CD set were organized rather haphazardly: chapters end and new chapters begin within a single track, without rhyme or reason. This may seem a minor detail, but to a teacher who assigns daily chapter readings, it's a real annoyance!"
5,The most awesome and catchy book,"My daughter is writing this review: Before I went to the library, I was thinking about this book. Then I borrowed it. Then when my dad was looking at his books, I started reading the book. You couldn't imagine how I loved it. It was AWESOME.I didn't want to stop. When my dad came and said it's time to go home, I kept having to ask for extensions, as I said before I just couldn't stop. Even when I came home, I didn't want to stop. I later purchased this book! Boys might not find that much interest in the book, but girls will find this very thrilling!"
3,Alyson,I heard Alyson sing on Marcus Johnson's cd Lesson in Love and wanted to hear more of her! Track 1 is o.k. I love track 2!! But that is it. I think Babyface or Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis to name a few could have gave her better songs and music.
2,Disappointed,"There were a few decent pieces of information, but overall I was not very impressed. Some of the content was OK, but the grammatical errors and different writing styles made it a very disappointing read. There were four different authors which contributed to the flow problems, and it was obvious that some of the chapters were more poorly written than others. In addition, it didn't seem like anyone even proofed the book. I can understand a few errors, but I found myself re-reading sentence after sentence trying to understand what words were missing, misspelled or out-of-place.The chapter on transactions was pretty decent. I liked the information on compensating transactions, which I had heard called three phase commit previously. The chapter on UDDI was pretty decent as well. I was disappointed in the last chapter on Event-Driven Architecture. It just seemed to be a hodge-podge catch all of the author's thoughts without much meat."
1,Dishonest authors,"These folks use my book, ""How to Open Locks With Improvised Tools"" in their work. They stated that my book was published by Harper Collins in 1997. The first version, ""Lock Bypass Methods"" was published in 1998, and the version they cite was published in 2001, by Level Four Publications. The title page, including contact info in my book, is concise and clear. Harper Collins has never touched it. No, they didn't ask permission for use, and there are so many spelling and grammatical errors that it is obvious they cut corners in other places, too. Since they're happy to invent spurious references when the real thing is readily available, I wouldn't hold much faith whatever else they cranked out. I'm sorry my name shows up in their shoddy work."
3,"yeap, they're plastic","I bought one of these for my bathroom. I was amazed to discover it was plastic, coated with metal plating. I, also, had to replace the aerator, and had the same problems. This unit doesn't leak, thankfully, but I believe that is due to the fact that I did not purchase a single-tower unit, which I did for my kitchen. Big mistake, as noted, below.For my kitchen, I bought the Kohler Fairfax kitchen faucet. When I disassembled unit to investigate a leak in the tower (which other owners have also reported) I discovered that this kitchen faucet is also plastic. Worse, it's unrepairable because their are few gaskets and washers. So, I have to buy a new kitchen faucet.You can bet I'm buying a Moen."
4,Great Music,"Great Music, not as good as the first songs album but makes a great addition for a set. Would reccomend"
5,Inspirational and humorous!,"This is an approachable read about a very difficult subject. The reader, whether a patient, caregiver or relative, will spend 11 months with Patty Gelman as she discusses her emotions, treatments and approach , with humor, to breast cancer. A must read for all caregivers and anyone else touched by this disease."
2,This book is too technical,I found this book a little too technical. They have a lot of pictures of fish disections to show the effects of disease. I would rather just have a book with pictures of sick fish that are still alive. I need that sort of info to figure out what my fish may have.
4,"Great, but not linear!","While I really appreciate good Stephen King novels, short stories, and the movies that come from them, it is always harder to enjoy a movie without a thoroughly developed story that lasts throughout. This movie was a compilation of his short stories instead, with four barely connected themes. I did love the kitty though!"
5,I love this guy!,"According to me and many people, Stephen King is the brand name for the horror books and films. I liked this film because it had an original script. It touches sensitive points about fear and usual human life. I can truly say that it made my night memorable."
3,It's ok.,"The dvd inside the case was ok, but the plastic case it came in was smashed. looked like someone sat somethimg heavy on it. Postal problem?? Vender problem?? Now, my problem! :("
2,Is this meant to be funny?,"This is NOT horror, and the effects are tacky. But it's still an average film. Cat's Eye tells the story of a tortoise-shell cat, who seems to be able to save everybody from monsters and other scary things.The first tale is quite creepy, and is a bout a man who tries to give up smoking. The Quit Smoking company try sinister methods to try and get the man to quit.The second part is the main NON HORROR film. It's about a man who is forced to walk around a ledge on the top of a tall hotel. An average thriller, but not scary.The third is where the supernatural comes into it, but the monster has little bells on it's head and is about ten centimetres tall, so this is the worst story of the lot. In places, it's funny, but is it meant to be?There are better films out there, but watch this if you have nothing better to do."
1,not a horror movie(except for the fact it is a horror to watch),"sstephen king can blame no one but himself for this missfire of a movie,because HE WROTE THIS JUNK! never finds it's feet, horror,comedy,drama,fantasy,adventure,and even thriller,it tries to be all and fails at each one!!! skip it!!!"
3,The Cat's Got the Goblin's Tongue,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodHere a good horror anthology! Three stories of dread & suspence, with a little black comedy.The third one is a doozy, as a cat protects a little girl from a Goblin that lives in her bedroom's wall, trying to suck out her life's breath while she sleeps! Her parents think the cat is to blame, but this is a true classic cat & mouse game of chess & chase! Great episode, & worth the price of admission alone!"
4,A rare quality adaption of Stephen King stories,"Just re-watched it on video. Here it is 14 years later and the effects and stories still hold up! Quitters, inc is my favorite. Beware the awful guy-falling-off-roof effect shot. I've seen better effects pushing on my eyes!"
5,Great Album,"This is a very good country album. The best song for me is ""Written In The Stars"" a very good story song and I love it. Please try and hear this album."
3,not what is pictured,"I received this item very promptly. However, the item pictured is the full cd, which is what I believed I ordered. What I received was a demo which had only one song on it. The pic on the front of the cd is different than the one shown, too. I didn't pay very much, and the demo is kind of cool, but it is not the full album, which is what I thought I was purchasing."
3,"Not bad, could be larger","It's not like looking out your car's rear view mirror since a bike isn't as stable a platform for a mirror as a car. It may need a little getting used to having to take quick peeps down at the handle bars to view the mirror, so perhaps a larger mirror surface area would take less time for me to capture the traffic picture behind me so I can concentrate on what's up ahead. Installion was breeze.GeorgeOceanside NY"
5,Great mirror,"This mirror is great. Infinite and easy adjustment. I have one in each end of my handle bars. I can see 180 degrees with these things. I highly recommend them. Oh, and they're very stable. No bouncing or vibrating that causes blured vision."
4,Bike Mirror,This mirror works well with my Townie 7 speed bike. It stays stationary when needed and can be moved but stays where you move it to. I've done about 30 miles with it and have had no problems. I would recommend this item for the the casual cyclist.
2,Hardware not the correct size.,"This would be a great product, if the screws fit properly. The long screw that actually mounts the unit to the bike was fine. But there are two shorter screws that assemble two arms to the mirror. These shorter screws were EXTREMELY tight. In getting these to go in all the way the unit cracked. I was still able to finish the assembly, but now with a cracked unit. So if this had the right sized screws for assembly it would have been great."
5,Have two of these,"I have these on both my MTB's and they work fine. Once you install and tighten them, they take adjusting really well and won't need to be tightened up again.Have taken a few hits and haven't broken off so seem durable as well.Great mirror for the price"
4,Bicycle mirror,This is a nice mirror for my Trek bicycle. Not all mirrors will work for my bike. It lets me know if people are coming up from behind to pass.
5,Great Mirror,"I looked at several other mirror styles before deciding on this one. After reading several positive reviews and watching a You Tube video on the intallation, I picked it. It was a breeze to install and works great so far. I do notice it gets bumped out of alignment once in a while, but I've been gradually tightening it up, so it's getting better. Especially for the price, I don't think you can beat it. Minimal vibration and good field of view."
5,Easy viewing mirror,This mirror is superb. I have other mirrors from another company but this one is what I highly recommend. Easy to install and stays perfect with the bike. Bought 3 of them so far for all our bikes.
5,Easy installation and adjustment,Went on quickly and I only tightened the screws all the way on the third day after doing re-adjustments while riding.Now it stays put and I only once needed to re-adjust when someone seemingly bumped it while being parked.Sometimes fogs up on cold mornings - but I presume that all glass mirrors will do that if not treated with anti-fog stuff...
5,Grreat Mirror,"Looks very good on bike, quality made parts, easy to install, fast shipping. What more could you want? It fit my bill......"
5,Works great!,I put this on my Giant Sedona ST mountain bike. Bit of pain to put on but it's a good mirror. Fits nice and tight and doesn't move. I like the mirror positioned inside/under..less likely to get damaged.
5,Best Mirror on the Market!,My Mirrycle MTB is now on it's second bike. I did have to replace the mirror part after dropping the bike...no fault of the mirror itself. It stays in place and gives a wide view of what's behind you.
5,Great Product,Threw this mirror on my trek 7.2fx (2013 model) after adding these handlebars to the bike as well (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I7PRUQ/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_title) and it still fit perfectly. Very secure and gives great added sight for when riding through nyc.
4,"Nice mirror for the price, but you may need to lube the cap screws","I was looking for a simple mirror that wasn't too expensive and this one did just that. I was also interested in something that would not break if the bike tipped, so the option to mount this toward the ""inside"" of the handlebar instead of the outside was attractive to me.I noticed some of the negative reviews centered on the mounting ""screws"" being too tight and of a non-standard size. I found this to be true for me as well. The cap screws would only go in a couple turns before binding up and making me fearful of breaking the plastic parts. I tried to ""clean"" the threads with a metric tap and die but it appeared to be 4mm x .8, which I did not have. In desperation I sprayed some teflon lubricant onto the threads. This worked wonderfully and I was able to connect all parts with the supplied hex-wrench without fear of breakage.This will now allow my wife to see how far I am behind her when we ride! :-)"
2,Mirror broke fairly easily,"I purchased the mirror a few weeks ago, and the purchase/delivery were fine. The mirror and frame assembled as directed. Just before my first ride the bike fell over as I was putting air in the tires, and the mirror hit something (ground perhaps) and cracked beyond useability. I checked the web site of the manufacturer and the replacement cost of the mirror alone was $5, but the shipping was another $5. The replacement cost of the mirror was almost the price I paid for the product in the first place.I contacted the manufacturer (explaining my situation) and was hoping they could send me a mirror with the shipping for $5, and they refused. They suggested buying 2 mirrors as an alternative (to make the shipping more palatable?). Very disappointed with the response.Anyway, I feel that the frame and design is great, but the mirror is way too fragile for a product that is sold as a ""mountain bicycle mirror""."
4,Great mirror - doesn't shake,"I have three bikes with these mirrors now and no complaints so far. One bike has had the mirror on for about a year now, and even though it gets bumped every so often, it can handle it. I will have to tighten that mirror on that particular bike, but the others are just great. They are easy to install and a great value for the price. No need to spend crazy amounts of money on more expensive models - it isn't meant for a fashion show! It's simple and the perfect size. Some smaller style mirrors create a problem where I try to scan for cars, etc too long. This is larger, maybe the size of a medium sized plum, approximately, and gives me plenty of time to move over if necessary. I have to mention that it was really easy to install - the toughest part was cutting a hole in the end of the handle bar grip, and then just screw it together. The construction is also pretty durable. Great value for the money."
4,Love it!,"Since I couldnt wait, I bought this from a local store. It is a great mirror. I tried the one which goes on the helmet but frankly it didn't help me much as the viewing area is so small. I wanted something like my car mirror with a clear view of cars zipping by me when I commute. This mirror did the trick. Make sure you install it correctly as it is a real help to make you feel secure while riding on the road."
1,i do not know how to install that,i do not know how to install that. And it requires a lot of work. It is very hard to install that
1,Broke in one week,"So, I got this mirror for my bike before I went to college. Well before a week was even up, it broke. The part that gets inserted into the handle bar snapped right off while I was biking. I didn't drop it or bang my bike around. It had been parked at the bike rack for a majority of that week."
4,Great mirror,This is a very high quality mirror made from sturdy material. Only reason I took one star off was because the screws required too much torque to get them to tighten. But it's for the best since this item is subject to vibrations.
5,Best yet,"This is my fourth or fifth mirror (can't remember exactly). But it is by far the best. The view is clear and big, and the mirror stays in place - I never have to adjust it as I ride - it doesn't work loose like the others - that was my biggest complaint about the other handlebar mirrors. If need be, it swings out of the way easily, and its easy to bring it back into the right location. I tried a helmet mirror, and it was like riding cross eyed - one eye on the mirror and one on the road -- it was funny in a way, but dangerous, which was not the point - I put it in a drawer the second day without regret.The local bike shop now stocks the mtb mirror after I bragged so much on it -- the amazon price is better though."
4,Solid,"Solidly constructed, the Mirrycle bumps along the road with little or no jiggling, the large mirror surface offers a good rear view without head movement, versatility allows several configurations, then easily folds away for storage or transport. As noted in the instructions and mentioned by several reviewers, you really MUST crank down HARD inserting the bolts! A good bang for the buck."
5,Well built must have item.,"I have three, one on each of our bikes and one spare.Pros:-Well made, sturdy.-good field of view, much better than eyeglass clip style.-easy to install and adjust.-durable when wacked and easy to readjust.Cons:-not included with every new bike."
5,perfect!,"This mirror only took my husband a few minutes to install on my bike, and it's great that it isn't scratching up my metal handlebars and is out of the way. I love it!"
2,it just works - but fragile (update),"Installation was easy and I was really surprised at how well I could see behind me. I had expected a lot more vibration- there is practically none. Tighten all the screws (there are 3) enough so that they are snug but you are able to move the arms for adjustments. Getting ready to order another for my wife's bike.UPDATE: So I liked the mirror much I put it on my wife's bike and ordered another one for mine. Opened the package and found a broken mirror lens. Amazon was great (as usual) about the return and sending a replacement. So I mount the mirror just snug enough so that it stays put but can be adjusted fairly easily, also figuring the flexibility would protect the lens if bumped. Well, I bumped the end of the mirror and the lens broke - in less than one day!! (No, I wasn't riding off-road.)Maybe I just had a run of bad luck, but a plain glass lens this big seems to be asking to break. Regardless, my original 5 stars is now only 2."
4,Sturdy and large enough,Numerous similar products I have used were too easily broken in the city and were too small this one seems just right. The mounting was simple and as expected. The material is of good quality and allows for differences in handle bar size.
5,Great mirror,This mirror is very steady and easily adjusted to the correct viewing position to see cars coming up from behind.
5,Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror,"Installed without a hitch on my homebuilt recumbent. The allen wrench required for installation is included, along with more than adequate instructions. The two cap screws ""are an extremely tight fit when screwed into the brass inserts"", but the instructions also tell you to ""don't worry about breaking any of the parts"". It's designed with two hinge points so you can point the mirror at virtually any angle you need. Highly recommended; its' #1 sales ranking @ amazon is justified."
1,Never in my life to find a product so poor in quality????,"My last Mirrycle was purchased some 21 years ago and used on the same bike until recently when it broke.The same new one arrives from Amazon, must be made by exceptionally inferior manufacturer, the plastic simply broken into pieces when you tried to assemble the unit. I am now having a pile of broken plastics...."
2,I could not use it.,I broke the plug at the end of my $600 bike just to discover that inside of it was filled by the metal holding handle-bar soft cover.
1,What's worst than awful?,"Do not purchase this product.It's poorly engineered. I own a Trek 8.4 DS and the item got stuck in the handle bar. Try to look for other products before buying this. If you do, use the smaller ""wedge."" The large wedge goes in, but it doesn't come out."
1,Cheap and horrible design,"I mounted this mirror on my bike, and THE NEXT DAY I accidentally tipped my bike over on the side that the mirror was mounted on, and the mirror hit the ground. Luckily for me, the mirror is made out of glass and it shattered on impact. I guess this product is too cheap to be made with any type of shock-proof material. Oh well, $15 lost and a lesson learned."
1,not worth the buy,"the mirror is nice but honestly i opened it about 2 months after getting it, just forgot it came, and its missing a screw to assemble and the mirror swivel SUCKS, so i wish for a refund but the window to do so closed"
1,Poor quality parts,I ordered this based on all the good reviews on this website. The package of parts received contained ill fitting bolts. Very poor quality. I will have to keep searching for a decent mirror and return this poor quality package.
2,Loosen screw made it difficult to keep mirror in position,My major problem with this is a screw on the mirror keep getting loosen and made it impossible tokeep the mirror in the proper position for long. I constantly have to tighten it. Very annoying!!!
4,works great,"I have tried a few bike mirrors , this one works great, very compact, light and great in size. But you will need to be careful if your bike falls since it could brake on impact. I suppose this would be true for any mirror . The adjustment is okay.Very well working product."
5,I cannot believe how well I can see everything behind me. Solid and high quality.,I cannot believe how well I can see everything behind me at a glance. Solid and high quality. Would recommend it to a friend.
5,Works great,"These mirrors are great because they are removable, adjustable & will fit on any sized bars."
5,Hindsight,They say hindsight is 20-20. This mirror proves that point. We put one on each bike. We are old and can't turn our heads anymore. Now we can see what is going on back there.
5,Great mirror set up,"This mirror is really a savior for me. It's easy to adjust while riding, is light weight, has a curved mirror and is not made of glass... features I required. For the price, the quality is excellent. As far as installation, they installed it at the bike shop where I purchased it, but I watched, and it seemed very simple. It also comes with a small tool to adjust it or change the mirror from sticking out or turned inward. At the bike shop they said if the plastic mirror should break, they have replacement parts. This might happen if I fell on that side. I now ride more safely because I can easily see behind me without turning."
4,Works Fine,This little mirror does a great job of showing me what is in my blind spot. It sticks out far enough from the handle bars to get around my rather large body and show me what may decide to run me over if I am not mindful.
3,Does the job,"The product arrived needing to be put together, was not too difficult to do nor did it take too long. Fitted onto my bike without an issue. The mirror has a nice wide angle, clear and easy to position but stays in place well. So far I like it, and I am glad I purchased it, I had a smaller mirror before and it was getting hard to see the traffic behind me."
2,"Good visibility, poor materials","I really have only one gripe with this mirror.It's made of a very hard and brittle plastic. This, when combined with expanding fasteners for the screws to spread apart when tightening, shatters with the slightest impact, and sometimes just from overtightening. I've gone through 5 of these mirrors in less than a year. I first ordered one due to the good reviews and the appearance (in the photo) that it was flexible to reduce the chance of breakage. My bike is a commuter, and I usually park it on the centerstand, but every so often it falls over. Result, broken mirror.If you buy one, buy a couple spares. Otherwise, be very careful setting your bike down and don't bump into anything with the mirror or it will break. I'm switching to a more durable hinged model."
5,Bull bar mount,"I checked out the pictures and thought, by leaving out a part, I could mount it in the end of my bull bar. Sure enough, it mounts that way. Very happy. Strong unit."
5,I SEE YOU!,"The mirror is wonderful for it's wide field of view, easy adjustment, and makes biking in the city much more safe. Stable view too. Easy to install as well with included hex wrench."
5,SO happy I returned a Schwinn mirror for this!,"My husband & I both bought & returned Schwinn mirrors & instead bought 2 ""Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror"", which we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! This mirror has a fish eye for full street view with minimum adjustments & holds it's placement. It's just a few dollars more & a much sturdier & useful product...good enough that we even bought one as a gift for a friend that's a more serious rider than we are. I was nervous about installation after reading some of the reviews for this mirror but we put one on a Schwinn Mt. bike & the other on an Eddie Bauer Mt. bike with no problems at all."
4,A well-made item,"I just received this item in the mail and have already installed it within 15 minutes. That includes opening the box, reading the instructions and final adjustment. The instructions were very clear and even advised to expect tighter than normal resistance of the mirror and mirror arm mounting screws. That is to be expected with any system which allows for adjustments-on-the-fly. Seriously, the arms will not break if you tighten the screws by hand. I can't say what would happen if you used a power tool but I warn against that as I have seen such things occur in my career as a machine mechanic. That experience also allows me to say before any road testing that this product is going to work just fine. The delivery was prompt and the package arrived intact."
5,The best I've had. Can be used without second arm...,"I've had a few mirrors, bar and helmet, but have settled on the Mirrycle.I suppose it's a negative that if you drop the bike it can break, but it's hard to make a mirror which will never break.I've generally used it leaving out the second (roughly horizontal) arm. It doesn't serve much purpose as far as I'm concerned, and adds unwelcome width filtering through traffic. Perhaps it would be less prone to breakage if I used it as is.I'm going to try tucking it down and inwards next time - if that works it should keep my profile slim and be break resistant. We'll see."
3,Not steady,"I have to constantly adjust the mirror. It may be because I didn't install it properly. At the proper position, it provides a good view to the rear."
4,"good mirror, with one caveat","This is a fine bike mirror at a reasonable price (and delivery from Niagara Cycle Works was speedy -- two days). However, it comes with two ""wedges"" for inserting the mirror arm into your bike handles....but neither fit my bike -- one was too small, the other too big. If that happens to you, try my solution: Wrap a rubber band around the smaller of the two wedges and insert it that way. Worked great for me."
1,Not easy to put together or install,"Not easy to put together or install. After more work than i was prepared to do for a bike mirror, it did not stay on, so I donated after a few users."
2,terrible to assemble,"I almost broke the thing trying to assemble it. you have to be very strong. otherwise, its an OK product."
4,awesome bike mirror,I bought this mirror because it was an in handle type mirror. It has worked just as I hoped it would. Easy to install and maneuver but you must be careful not to break it when going through tight spots....
5,Mirrors,I needed these mirrors for my motorized scooter. Unfortunately they didn't fit but they came in handy for my grandson's bicycle. My merchandise arrived earlier than expected in new and excellent condition. I would definitely transact business with this seller again.
5,It's GREAT !,"Put me on the list for a positive review. Replaced a cheezy Bell ""strap on mirror"" with this mirror. Not nearly as much shake from vibrations. Holds secure once assembled yet will still fold back without damage if you ""whack"" it on something. Some mechanical aptitude required for assembly.Mirror surface has superior quality. Spare parts avalailable from company.Clear, concise instructions in GOOD english.On a very heavy Currie Ezip and it's holding up well after a few weeks, no adjustment has been needed. Couldn't say that for the Bell which shook out of position on our rough roads every few minutes."
2,Not very durable.,"I've owned three of these, but will buy no more; it's too easily broken. It was easy to install, and it's not too hard to adjust.The biggest flaw is durability. I bicycle commute 16 miles a day, through a park and on city sidewalks. Even in this rather benign environment, this will get broken or wear out in a few months. The least impact at speed with bushes, tree branches, poles or other obstructions can crack the mirror or break the plastic mount.Also, a few months of adjusting the mirror via the friction mounts wears them out and the mirror will no longer hold position.I cannot imagine these mirrors lasting more than 2 or 3 rides on mountain trails."
3,Adequate,"It is good for making sure friends are keeping up on a ride. Not exactly something you should rely on when riding in traffic though. Too small, and there is no vibration dampering."
3,OK Mirror,I received the product and it is easy to assemble and the mirror fits on my bike.The screws it comes with are extremely tight and it does say this but you really need a set of pliers or something to hold the mirror arm and possibly a second set to turn the allen wrench. They are difficult.My mirror actually fell onto the floor and shattered but the company offered to send me a replacement for free so they are good and stand behind their products. I woudl just take caution installing the mirror.
3,Doesn't fit my bike :(,"I have used this mirror on a Cannondale mountain bike and it worked well. It can be moved up/down and left/right for a pretty good range of movement/view. Thing is, I just bought a Trek ""Utopia"" and this mirror DOES NOT FIT. So sad. The box says it fits handlebars with inside diameters of 15.5mm - 22.5mm and mine are just barely under 15.5mm. Maybe if I somehow scrape or sand or cut down the size it will be fine. Just be sure to measure the inside diameter of your handlebars before buying."
3,bike mirror,Tried to tighten up the o ring and the mirror went flying off and broke. Otherwise a good product...you just have to be careful with the installation.
5,"Now husband wants one, too","Hubby and I are new bike riders. We each got a mirror that attaches to the helmet. I realized right away that it wouldn't work well with my progressive lenses, so bought the Mirrycle instead and love it. We just got back from a 25 mile ride, and now my husband wants one, too. I highly recommend this mirror."
3,A tale of 2 mirrors...,"I would have given this mirror 5 stars if I would have only bought 1, but the 2nd one I bought, the mounting hardware cracked while installing it. The cross-threaded screws install so they won't unscrew with vibration and are quite stiff to install, on the 2nd mirror, they were easy, because the mounting hardware split as I was installing the screws!!Even though cracked, the product still perfectly functional.All in all still a very nice product, be carefull when installing...you have been warned!"
5,bike mirror,"This was exactly the type of mirror I was looking for. It gives a very good view of any traffic coming up behind me without having to turn my head. I also like the flexability in positioning it on my handle bar. I had checked local bike stores who either did not carry the mirror or it was way more than the Amazon price. Plus, I had the mirror exactly 24 hours after ordering. That is service!"
3,tfmdam results,"Nice range of movement, screws loosen up easily, had to shim and add lockwasher to veritcal pivot. Good viewing, but sticks out there and can be vulnerable. Usefull, can be left or right mounting."
2,Not so hot,"They worked out OK at first but the quality wasn't the best. after a short time they became loose and one even broke off, so i would look for a better one next time."
4,No regrets!,"I just got back from my first ride with the Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bike Mirror installed. Good experience!First thing is don't think this mirror is only for mountain style bikes...I used it on my Next Avalon comfort style bike. Second and probably most importantly is don't be concerned about the screws being quite tough to get installed. They are tight and they will get rather warm from the friction. They are designed that way on purpose so the joints don't vibrate loose while riding. I was very pleased with the shipping time too. It arrived 2 working days early using regular shipping. Can't hardly beat that. I've always been apprehensive while riding along a roadway not having a good way to keep an eye out for ""distracted drivers"" coming up from behind. Now I can watch my back...literally! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is I don't know about duribility yet. Great product and I will definitely recommend to my biking friends."
2,"a lot of tiny washers, long screws and nuts","There were a lot of tiny washers, long screws and nuts to put the mirror together and install; however it was easy enough to figure out and the package provided an allen wrench. Viewing the pics of the product online, I thought the ribbed-looking arm piece was perhaps some of flexible plastic or rubber but its actual hard plastic or even wood maybe. I thought I would be able to bend the arm to get it in the rearview position I wanted, but that's not the case. You have to pivot the hard plastic pieces. Not quite what I was expecting, but it'll do for the price."
5,Great Bike Mirror!,"I purchased this bike mirror in 2009 for my wife's bike. It was relatively easy to install, and has stood up well over many rail trail and tow path rides over the years. We look forward to many more years of use!"
3,"'eh, there's others out there","I'm stationed in japan and do a lot of bike riding. I bought this to try and help me not get hit by cars. While the mirror serves its purpose, i didn't like that a had to cut a hole in the rubber of one of handle bars to mount it and the adjustments only go in two directions, up and down left and right. Oddly enough I went down to 100yen store and found a bike mirror that just clips to my handle bars and has a greater range of flexibility. The product itself isn't bad, its just there are others out there for comparable prices."
4,Myrricle,"A good bike mirror. Careful reading of the instructions,however, is essential because the screws form a VERY TIGHT FIT into their threaded fitting. First impression is that the wrong hardware was sent with the unit! It feels lIke something will break! Read the instructions!"
5,Great safety item!,"After trying another on handlebar mirror we were happy to find this one. It is excellent, giving you an unobstructed view of the road behind with a substantial size mirror. The fold-away aspect helps with storage."
5,Good bike mirror.,"This a terrific bike mirror, especially in ""View"" of the mirror extension. It assembles and installs quite easily (Good instructions too). I have two and wouldn't buy any other."
4,Good mirror,"This mirror is actually a mirror and not a mirrored surface, which is great. It doesn't minimise or enlarge the reflection, so is a true reflection. It's very clear, even around the edges, and is actually glass and not plastic. Unfortunately, I dropped and broke it before I could use it, so I can't comment on how it functioned."
5,Excellent mirror,Great mirror and exactly as described. This mirror will adjust to any bike or riding style. Very happy with my purchase.
4,Great bicycle mirror,"I had to replace my Mirrycle MTB Bar End Mountain Bicycle Mirror when the previous mirror was broken in a biking accident. It was easy to remove the round mirror from the bar end assembly and replace it. This small unobtrusive mirror gives a good view of what's behind you without taking up much space. The arms bend in all directions so that the mirror can be positioned exactly as you prefer. And since the mirror mounts on the bar end, it takes no space on the handlebars."
5,bast mirror for bike and scooter,I have this mirror on my electric scooter x500 and I love it very used full but the only think is that one time I hit it well I was riding my scooter with a little hit the mirror broke but it still worth 5 stars
5,best bike miror on the market,The Mirrycycle bar end bike mirror is the best bicycle mirror on the market for the money.
3,pain in the rear...view,"I must be doing something different to everyone else. Bought this for my commuter. It gets knocked out of alignment in the garage, knocked out of place in the bike racks, knocked if I dare put the bike down. Every time I ride the bike I have to readjust it. It is fiddly to readjust because only 2 degrees of freedom (twist and tilt). Tightening the bolts just makes the inevitable readjustment more difficult. I guess it's just bar end mirrors in general I'm going to have problems with as a commuter who's pushed for bike parking space. It adds 4-inches to the width of the bike, which is a pain in general. This mirror is well made and designed so if you're not using your bike in cramped conditions maybe it will serve you well. Not me.Adjusted right, it works well in traffic. But it does not work well at all for checking my son in the bike trailer - the adjustment isn't flexible enough to see what's behind me."
2,Bad hardware!,The shorter bolts that came with this don't match the threads for their respective holes. Other than that it seems alright.
1,Bad screws,"My order came with the wrong screws or a bad nut thread, the thing is that one of the main screws just go 2 turnes in the nut inside the arm piece. Now I am trying to find the right screw for the piece."
1,Cheap made,screws would not work would not fit like they were the wrong tread type could not use bought a much better product at Walmart cheaper and works better don't buy this item
2,Less than you bargained for,"The concept of FlipAlbum is great and when it works it's great. Which isn't often. I found it to be full of bugs - lots of things not working as they are supposed to and I had to do things over and over and over because the program reverted back to an earlier state. It was extremely frustrating. Tech support? - just terrible. If you actually get a response after a week or so it's something to the effect ""did you follow directions?"" and when you answer ""yes"" you never hear from them again. If they ever get it to work properly I might take another look at it, but I've found simpler programs that aren't quite as fancy but they work."
