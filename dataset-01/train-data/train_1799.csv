5,Fun for the kids and their parents,"My daughter is crazy for Oxenbury's babies. The illustrations and text are a perfect marriage for toddlers. They can relate to the simple, every day message Tickle, Tickle relates...""gently, gently brush your hair"". My daughter's favorite part is ""tickle, tickle under there"" when she gets a HUGE tickle from her dad or me. a must read."
2,Not what was expected,"My 12 month daughter was not attracted to this book, it's too short and there isn't enough of a story. There are much better books out there that will keep a child's attention."
2,Not what I thought,"I thought this is a book on growing the stuff you need to brew a beer. The plant desriptions are not extraordinary and the part of the recipies completely useless- at least for me. The ingredient lists are just too long, and I'm not a millionare. Each recipe ask for different kinds of malts for example. You might be able to brew excellent beers with that book, but I doubt that they will be cheaper than any boutique beer you buy in an upmarket shop."
3,Great Gift,This book had a totally different approach to home-brewing.One that should be appreciated by any amateur gardener.
4,Great info on herbs,"The first section on growing hops is decent, but it's nothing you can't find online.But the section on herbs is great. Not only does it give a list of brewing herbs but, more importantly, how much to use and how. I've researched gruits and know what types of herbs were used, but I never knew how much to add.There's also a section on grain. While I'd like to grow some grain, I'm not keen on malting. I may stick with unmalted wheat as that seems the easiest. Rye and Oats would have been nice, but they strongly advise against malting those items.Overall, a good book- mainly if you have the land and time to grow your own ingredients. With the large amounts and quantities I brew, it doesn't make sense for me to go this route. Especially when I can get grain delivered for about 30 cents a pound."
3,Not a whole lot of info here.,"I was interested in info on growing hops. Very little of the book covers that particular subject. I learned a lot more from going to FreshHops.com. Lets take a common subject like say, ""growing hops in containers (above ground), and what to do with them over winter; nothing here folks... move along."
2,Book is okay -- not what I was hoping for,"Chances are that if you are buying this book, you are trying to grow your own hops.If that's the case, I suggest you save your cash and just go to listen to a podcast by The Brewing Network. I bought this book wanting to plant hops and everything in the book about hops was covered by a few different podcasts available on The BN.If you want to grow and malt barley, in addition to growing hops, this book is what you are looking for."
3,"Handy, but glosses over some subjects","I really bought this to improve my hop growing, but the chapter was all a bit simple and short. I was looking for nutrient information to get less foliage growth and more hops, but there's not really much info about that at all. It's still a great book to have in your brewing library but maybe more of an introduction than an in-depth resource."
5,Comprehensive guide to everything you wanted to know about growing your own beer.,"I found this guide to growing ingredients for making beer enjoyable and practical. It is written on a level that someone with a basic understanding of gardening can understand quickly, and offers practical advice on not only how to grow things like hops and such, but the role each ingredient plays in the flavoring of your homebrew. It covers topics as varied as the subtle differences between hop varieties, the role different ingredients play in flavoring beer, and the use of wild ingredients that the settlers used to make beer from the ingredients around them. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to take homebrewing beyond merely buying a packaged kit and brewing it up in the kitchen."
3,"Great Commentaries, The Rest is ""Blah!""","First off, Chris Rock is funny. Really funny! I haven't seen him on SNL (I lost interest in that show a long time ago) but I was really looking forward to this DVD.The best parts is when Chris Rock is NOT doing comedy sketches. The comedy was not funny at all. The only parts worth laughing at were lines not spoken by Chris Rock. If this was the best Chris Rock did on SNL then I'd had to see what didn't make the cut.But what was funny was his social commentaries and correspondent reports. Chris Rock is the master at commenting on what is wrong with what goes on in this country.If you rent or buy this then expect to not be entertained through most of the show. But the rare funny moments are worth hanging out for."
2,Not what you'd expect,I bought this dvd thinking it was hillarious. I was very dissapointed. Didn't have the funnies you think.
5,Very Unlucky Leprechaun,"This is a great childrens movie. It will make you laugh, how this Leprachaun brings bad luck, not good to a girl who has just moved to a small town, then come to find out, he does help her out. Buy this movie for your small children right here at amazon.com."
1,"Beautiful photos, but......","I have been looking at many World History Encyclopedia style books. This one is beautiful but... well,lets just say I think the D in DK stands for Darwin. There are many other books out there that start at 10,000 BC, and not 200 million years ago as this does. Also which don't push evolution which is a science theory in a history book. Keep shopping."
4,Beautiful book,"More of a time line with illustrations and brief bits of information than a verbose treatment of history. In fact, many important people (Caesar Augustus, Ronald Reagan, The Medici Family, and more...) are barely mentioned or not mentioned at all, to my disappointment. More is said about Hitler than George Washington.Nice reference nonetheless."
5,Captivating,"I'm new to Anita Burgh's writings, but I tell you that I could not put this book down. I read it twice in a row because I couldn't believe it was over. The House of Harcourt takes you back in time as if you've lived in the 1700's. Each character is thoroughly developed. From the beginning to the end, it all unfolds and comes together nicely. I'm a fan of Anita Burgh after reading House of Harcourt. Now, I'm looking forward to reading other books she has written. Enjoy as I'm sure you will."
5,Great!,"I like reading books like this with short stories, and this was my favorite one yet. All the stories are great!"
1,POORLY WRITTEN,"I was told to get this book by my company. I can't believe they buy into this baloney. There are a lot of these quality programs out there; but, this one is probably the worst. Ill conceived and poorly written."
5,Really helped me Get'er done,"Number one, it was so easy to grasp the concepts. As we studied each Pillar we summarized the concepts and created Power Point presentations for our team members. There was no technical jibberish nor in depth philosophical ramblings; just what to do and why.Also, I thoroughly enjoyed studying the 5 Pillars and the team members have enjoyed implementing it, though we are not all the way done yet. I just couldn't wait to tell someone how pleased I was with this simple and yet very effective book. It's just the right thing to keep everyone's mind off of the poor economy, especially since we have a little spare time on our hands."
3,Skip this and find the 2006 edition,"I discovered that the 2006 edition existed right after I bought this one. Pam Stenzel gives the same consistently great presentations, with excellent arguments and messages, in all the editions I have watched so far (obviously she has done this zillions of times). But I am disappointed in the public school version in this package: she leaves out so many important issues, which are covered in the faith-based one. The 2006 public school edition contains all of the issues covered in the faith-based one (minus, of course, the mentioning of God and the Bible), including the latest medical information, most importanly the HPV vaccine. It must be noted that the two 2006 versions are sold separately, but they are worth the prices.By the way, I am a family physician, and I fully endorse these teen sex education videos."
1,Crud,"This is a pricey product so I expected quality. Installation was made difficult by the instructions not including one of the pieces shipped in the box. In other words, I unpacked the box, opened the instructions, and in the PARTS LIST at the top of the page, one steel bracket and two bolts were not mentioned! Oh well, I lost 1 hour trying to figure out the right way to mount that bracket, and got it to work. Screwed on the mounting bracket, slid the CPU onto the track and.... crooked! There's nothing to be done about it. I spent another hour messing with the various clamps, to no avail. My machine is not especially heavy but it pulls the clamp sideways. And Fellowes calls this their professional line? I'm going to go with a computer mount that goes ALL THE WAY around the machine---I suspect any L-shaped bracket might cause a problem like this.Disappointed + inconvenienced + return hassle = 1 star."
3,Quantity over Quality,"I'm a huge fan of Christine Feehan -- I own all of her books, two copies of some -- and that's why I purchased ""Lover Beware."" I do wish, however, that she would eschew short stories and novellas and stick with her wonderful full-length novels. Her short stories allow for neither character nor plot development. This story could have been so much more. I'll continue to purchase any book with Ms. Feehan's name on the cover, but I believe that her best body of work are the full-length Dark novels.The other stories in the book were akin to excerpts and were clearly crying, ""Buy the sequel!"""
3,Stories were good but padded for length,"While I enjoyed every story in this anthology, it also seemed to me that each story could have benefited from some judicious trimming. There were repetitious sections, dialog and scenes. These stories would have been stronger shorter, instead of being padded for length. That having been said, again, I read each story all the way through and enjoyed each one."
3,Lover Beware,"I got this book cause I knew there was an Eileen Wilks story in it about the Lupi, but it was a different take on the full length novel series and I don't think it's as good. In hindsight I wouldn't bother reading this story since ""Tempting Danger"" is a far better story about the same thing. You learn a little more about grandmother though, which is interesting."
4,FEEHAN - Magic in the Winds - SENSATIONAL !! -,"Christine looks to have another winner on her hands withthis new series. This book captures you within thefirst few pages, and now i can't wait to see what happenswith the other sisters.I did have one comment, Damon seemed to be a little soft and easy going, actually way to soft and easy going.However i still am looking forward to the other sisters stories"
5,One of the best british sitcoms,"This is where men Behaving Badly hit it's stride in the fourth series. This series features a few episodes that really stand out for me. The episode Drunk has Gary and Tony getting very drunk and trying to get back into their house when Dorothy has locked them out. In another episode Gary looks after Dorothy when she's had an operation. I always wince in that episode and I can safely say that should I fall ill I don't want Gary within 100 feet of me! In the final episode of the series I always crack up when I see Tony trying to remove his tooth, personally I think this is one of the funniest parts of the whole series. Of course Tony still has problems and this will change how everyone sees each other."
1,crashed my computer,I installed this software and merged my C: and D: I chose to copy the files in D: to a folder in C:This request crashed my computer and made the hard-disk useless. I had to reformat my hard disk and reinstall the OS. Lost precious data and wasted 2 days due to this useless software.Never ever buy this stuff
5,Norton PartitionMagic 8.0,"This product is excellent. I used it to resize partitions and add new partitions without losing any data. I added new partitions, or resized existing ones on several machines without even reading the manual. Very easy to use. This is a first rate product. I tested it on dual boot Windows 2000/XP, and Red Hat Linux 9 with no problems. I never lost any data and I now have very nicely partitioned my machines. I like to have 2 separate partions for each operating system, and this product did the job flawlessly."
2,Just a warning to those who want to install 2 OSs on 1 drive,"I have 2 PCs, one with Windows ME and one with XP. I wanted to have both OSs on these machines. The addition of Windows XP to the ME machine worked well. But adding Windows ME to the XP machine crashed my system unrecoverably. Make sure you backup your hard drive before attempting what I did using Partition Magic."
3,Good product; not current,"Pros: This product delivers what it promises for desktop application and is relatively easy to use and set up.Cons: I would have given this five stars, but for the REQUIREMENT that the machine have a floppy drive for rescue disk creation in this day and age of CD/DVD and USB drives. Way too limiting and outdated to overcome.Overall, I recommend for desktops (which I happen to have but not for laptops unless you have an external floppy)."
1,Inferior Technical Support - do not waste your time,"I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.I am sorry that I did this as the level of support provided for this product is vastly inferior to that provided by Symantec for other products that I have purchased from them. All I wanted was to increase the size of my system partition on my C: drive by getting rid of some free space at the beginning of the drive. I was unsuccessful in ever accomplishing this despite hours on the phone with Symantec Technical Support. I was only able to speak to technical support staff in India who finally told me that they could not solve my problem, but that I would be called back by a senior engineer. It never happened despite repeated promises. I finally gave up and returned the product to Symantec for a refund."
4,Well it worked for me,"I'm not a techie and had no chance of getting technical assistance where I live but I did have an XP based computer with a ridiculous 10GB C drive and 160GB D drive partition so it gave the impression that there was lack of memory where it needed it most.Reading the reviews, they seem to split between ""works well"" and ""scrambled my hard drive"" but, with no alternative, I took the gamble.Anyway it worked first time and I found it easy to use. Beginner's luck maybe"
1,Don't Buy Norton (Symantec),I have used Norton antivirus and got a virus.I used Partition Magic and it ruined my hard drive.I will not buy their junk again.
2,Fixed a Partition Problem,"For some unknown reason, my Acer Laptop came with the hard drive partitioned into two drives of 25 gigs each. C drive maxed out at 25gig while D drive was empty. Partition Magic made it easy to move the partition and free up the C drive.partition magic does a lot more, but I haven't needed the rest."
4,House into dub into...?,"The ""Main Street Records"" story is what this really is. Starting with a pretty conventional house record in Andy Caine's ""I'm Your Brother"", this CD traces a gradual morph in sound from that, to the ultra-deep trippy dub of Tikiman's ""Na Fe Throw It"", which sounds like it was mixed at the bottom of a heavy-water pool reactor. And all in between, starting with the Basic Channel remix/redux/reconstruction of ""I'm Your Brother"" as ""Quadrant Dub II"" (which was actually released on Basic Channel), this disc charts a course that leads through some of the deepest, most dusted dub this side of the ghost of King Tubby. By the time you get to the end, it's obvious that the dub wins out totally over the house that starts the disc off, and there's tracks on here you'll likely just want to put on repeat over and over again. Much to dig massively here..."
3,A lightweight...,"After reading the review suggesting this book is a little too much and it involves throwing around large files etc, I thought that this would be a high end book and something I would be interested in. Well Im a bit sad to say its very light on material. If your a beginner you may get a kick out of it but anything more than that you will be very dissapointed in this title. Much better books out there."
3,"Beautiful, but sloppy.","A. The blow-by-blow accounts of the steps the photographers featured in this book use to create these stunning images are indeed comprehensive, and fascinating. There's stuff to be learned here, even for beginners, but almost all of the examples require access to some pretty serious cameras and computer hardware...the artists are regularly working with individual files of 50, 100, almost 200 mb in *.RAW format, and spending hours or days in Photoshop to achieve the effects illustrated.B. For all its beautiful production values and technical sophistication, this thing was sloppily edited...words are missing, lead-on sentences go nowhere, and in at least one instance, ""there"" was unforgivably used when the author meant ""their."" If there's a second edition, let's hope some of the money gets thrown at a decent copyeditor."
2,Not an introduction.,"I disagree that this book is a good introduction to sendmail. It does not cover the basic options well, and very quickly goes off the deep end of the sendmail.cf file. It is probably a very good introduction to the advanced sendmail.cf programming that most people will never need to do.It barely mentions how to create sendmail.cf using the m4 macro processor. It doesn't cover virtual hosting well, but spends pages and pages on uucp and decnet mail. And ,it is unix-centric to the point of assuming that all users will be on unix boxes with their own properly configured hostname and sendmail, rather than on DHCPed PCs down the hall (which seems to be the current situation).All in all, this book told me little of nothing about the sendmail tasks I have to accomplish and way too much about stuff I should never have to touch."
4,good product,"this company is the best, i got the item i requested in a couple of days. they ship fast."
1,piece of junk,"waste of money - out of date, full of typos (the ""Isreal"" embassy, ""Jaurez""....doesn't inspire confidence in the accuracy of the info) wish I had gotten the guia roji instead."
2,Not all that useful,This isn't quite a streetmap of Mexico City so if you don't intend to buy a guide of the city then you won't be disappointed by this map. What it does show you are some less than ideally detailed maps of the center city (from Chapultepec to about the historic score) and a little north and south. Not that useful if you wanted to make it out to other parts of the city like Xochimilco for example. This is not that useful unless you plan on staying confined to this area of the city.
1,Of no use to me,"This isn't a map of Mexico City as a whole; that is, you can't spread it out and see where the various areas are in relation to each other. But the reason I couldn't use it is because the area I was interested in, Condesa, is obscured by an ""inset"". They might as well have placed a bumper sticker over this part of the map."
2,Ony a Portion of the city,"This map is only a very partial section of the city. It is absolutely useless, unless you plan to only go to the main tourist areas. If you are like me, and need a map of the streets of Mexico City, for work, study, play and to explore the city, then this is not the map for you. It is not a street map of Mexico City. Thousands of streets are left out. Most of the city is missing from this map. Do not rely on this map to help you find your way around if you are coming to Mexico City to do business or if you have friends who live in Mexico City. It may only be useful for a quick visit to the city for tourist purposes."
2,this map is just a tourist map,Streetwise Mexico city map needs to be twice the size to include the rest of the city that is missing.It is sturdy but if your planning any travel out side the center of town you will need a better map
4,This is my life,"ok so i get this as a binder/ computer case for school and you see i was really disorganized but theis thing changed all of that it has a spot for everything it is sut incredible the only issue is that sometimes the zipper jams and the thing is really big wich has both good and bad parts firs of all you can put alot of stuff in it but it is hard to open and close it eficently but it's probobly just me, over all this thing ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,supensful and twisted,"amazingly suspenseful. you never will see it coming until she shoves it down your throat, just chocking you with suspense and surpise. slightly creepy, and completely suspenseful. great for teens. the writing is great to. good book, gave it a 4 because it almost had too many twists."
4,The Twisted Window,"I relly liked this book. It did start out slow but it then picked up and got intersting. I thought Brad was fine in the begining but then got a little weird at the end. At the end of the book it got to where I could not put it down, it was so good.There was a chapter that was confusing but i read on and found out what it was saying.I think the reason it is called twisted windo is everthing bad that happened to Brad, his mind changed it. So he saw something that happened got changed in his mind."
4,Twisted Window,"This book has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It's about a young teenage boy around 16 or 17 who is on a quest to find someone who will help him find his young sibling Mindy. He notices a certain young lady named Tracy who reminded him of his Best Friend. He asked her if she would join him on his journy. Tracy replied yes, but she didn't know just how dangerous he really is. This book is not dull or boring like most. Its goes through series of adventures and mystery that really make you think. I could hardly put the book down. I recomend this book to any schools in America and to any young teenager who loves mystery storys. i will indeed read more books from Louis Duncan."
4,I liked it!,"This book had a lot if suspense in it and at first it seemed too unwrap to quiqly but then thats when you begin to realize that somethin is going to happen anyways I dont want to ruin it for the people who havent read it but I definatly recomend it. And I want to responed to some readers that reviewed the book and said somethin about the title, well to me ""The twisted window"" means more like his mind because he twistes things in his mind, anyway this is a good book so read it & give it a try!"
4,The Twisted Window Review,"In the book, The Twisted Window, Tracy Lloyd is grateful to have a complete stranger staring at her during lunch. The boy walks over and introduces himself as Brad Johnson from Albuquerque, New Mexico. Soon enough, Tracy finds herself caught up in Brad's twisted plot to kidnap his sister from his evil stepfather, Gavin Brummer. Tracy not only finds herself disobeying her loving aunt and uncle, who have cared for her ever since her mother, an actress, was stabbed, but she also ends up on a crazy drive to New Mexico with Brad and his supposed sister Mindy. Is the little girl who calls herself 'Cricket' really Mindy, Brad's beloved little sister? Is this plan more twisted than appears? How will Tracy ever convince Brad to come to his senses... if he has any..."
2,Warning: Originally published in 1987,"I must admit I feel cheated. ""The Twisted Window"" was originally published in 1987. This is the same story with some added references to cell phone usage and other items to help update the story. It is not a new Lois Duncan book as I was expecting.Original publication date aside, this is just not one of her better stories. The characters are not well developed and the ending was extremely predictable - of course that could be because I read it in the Eighties. I just feel there are better Lois Duncan books, for example, ""I Know What You Did Last Summer.""Disclaimer: I received a copy of the book for my Kindle in exchange for my honest opinion."
3,A Worthwhile Mystery,"This book is a wonderful mystery. It's about an ""insane"" teenager who kidnapped a little girl, who he claims as his sister whom was kidnapped by her father, after his mother had divorced him.Only, later, to find that he had made a terrible mistake.If you are wanting to read a spine-tingling mystery, The Twisted Window is the book to look for.You can never prepare yourself for what will happen next, in the book, of course."
1,Twisted Window,"I read the book the twisted window by lois ducan. i could not say i cared for the book in fact i don't see how anybody could. Sure it has myestry and suspance. but are incoherently jumbled so that you can't get in the book since there is little Character depth you cant feel for the people in the book, there was only one person i felt sorry for snd that was me for reading this ""novel"". the ending was pretty shoddy. the book surely taks fter the title, reading this book is like look in a twisted window."
1,twisted window,"the bookstarts out slow.but ok.the book sucks, well thats my opinion. If you like books about phsyco kids that lye to there mom and kidnap little girls then this is your book.I would not be writing this review if my teacher didn't make me.I wouldn't waste my time. This is chick flick, but if guys like this kind of book then let them read it. To all you chicks out there this is your book.Writtin by Jeff Milby Tower Heights Middle School If you like to contact me about my review My addres is GNOFF1315@aol.com"
5,A GREAT BOOK,"This book was exciting and thrilling, it kept me hanging at the end of each chapter and I loved it! I have read many Lois Duncan books and this one is one of her best. Tracy feels Brad watching her but when she looks up his name in the school directory he is not there. He doesn't go to her school!?! If he doesn't, what does he want with her? If you want to know, buy this book!"
2,Needs to be sealed better so it doesn't leak,"I bought the Neowrap that this is used for, and have had to buy these replacements because the original one leaked. After using the first replacement a few times, it has started to leak as well. And not just in one small corner--in at least a couple of areas on the cold pack. I think they need to do a better job of sealing edges so that this doesn't happen."
3,Good idea,"Good item. They should round off the corners, so that the packs are easier to insert into the fishnet-like holder for them."
2,good when it works,"I bought this casette deck 1.5 years ago, looking for something that would be decent to last me through grad school. I dub a fair amount of tapes (I buy most of my music on vinyl) for myself and friends, so I wanted something of decent quality. Well, after 1.5 years of moderate use, the record head seems to have quit on me. I'm going to look into fixing it, but I feel that it will be foolish to sink more money into this after it broke in such a short time. For my money I think I'm going to bite the bullet and go with a cd-r component instead."
3,fireplace,"the wood burns too hot, making it very unsafe for indoor use. almost burned down the house, would not reccommend it for cooking"
1,Change rating to 5 stars if you like ...,"spankings, lechery and the lash. There are two stories in this book that I found mundane to say the least.This Masquarade version, the Yellow Room took it's title from the fact that the room in which Miss Alice Darvell is shut in to receive her repeated and continuous punishments. Although the book says the room got its name from the curtains I think that it got its name for the golden showers that Uncle Edward seems to like so much ...The second part or the book is a series of letters from Miss Coote and her experience at a French all girl boarding school. These letters have been published so many times as filler in so many books that I think I have alll the letters memorized ...I am upset that the publisher does not include this information in the name of the book since 128 pages of a 210 page book have nothing to do with the 'Yellow Room' story .."
1,Waste of time,"If you are time-starved please don't waste one minute on this material, workbooks or DVD. I wish I could rate it zero stars. Don't worry about offending your non-Christian friends because there is zero substance and zero Biblical application. Our church group tried it for 2 weeks and everyone threatened to quit if we didn't move on to better material."
1,Everything is extra,"After ordering the install and ""activating"" online it took them a week and a half to get back to me. This was after I sent them an email requesting status. They put me in touch with the installer (35 miles away) and left it up to me to make the appointment. When I arrived the guy explained that mounting it where I wanted would be extra. It would have been nice to know this before I paid for the install and before I made the long drive.The install was nothing special."
2,Not much for the money,"Sorry to be the bad guy here, but I felt this was one of the most 'low budget' motorcycling books I have read (literally and figuratively). The editing was EXTREMELY poor - grammar erros serious enough to confuse concepts, wrong words, missing words, etc. The author tries to write in a 'down to earth', conversational-type style, but is only marginally successful.From a technical standpoint (getting beyond the errors to what he's trying to get across), I did find a few helpful tips. If you don't mind spending the money and the reading time to sort out 3 or 4 items that may help improve your riding, go for it. Otherwise, I'd suggest you save your money and put it toward a better book."
2,Don't expect too much,I was disapointed and could not learn much from it. I didn't like the writing style - very distracting - and concepts - confusing. Try Twist of the Wrist II from Keith Code and/or Sport Riding Techniques from Nick Ienatsch. Those are good investment.
1,Save your money,"Amazon offers several great books that will help you improve your riding and street survival skills - unfortunately, this book is not one of them. The author's ego and lack of knowledge have produced a book with few meaningful insights into sport riding. You will be better served by any of the excellent instructional books from Keith Code, David L. Hough, Nick Ienatsch or Lee Parks."
5,great book !,I wish there were more books like this one on motorcycles. It worth its weight in gold. Too many of motorcycle books trying to compensate for a lack of originality and content by a gloss paper and meaningless pictures.
2,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing. There is a variety of men of all types (clean cut all-american, hairy hippy, tattoed and pierced) and colors, which is nice. The problem is, at least a third of these pictures are badly out of focus and/or badly (not artistically - badly) lit. Other pictures look like something you could snap off with a cell phone camera or the men simply just are not very interesting (I like a bit of personality.) In addition, many of the men don't actually get into the lotus position. The few nice pictures don't make up for the many poor or so-so ones, so it is too much money for the price."
4,"Know nothing about Japan, then read this!","A good book for those interested in Japanese culture. A very helpful additon to one's literature collection, especially for East Asian Studies majors."
2,This book needed some work.,"I have read alot better in my times. Some people my like this book, but not me."
3,Not really a running book,"I have to admit that I'm only halfway through this book, but honestly I have put it aside for a while. Dean's book is good, but know that it's closer to a business or personal improvement book than a running book. If that is what you are looking for, this is a good one. But Dean is definitely not the next Sheehan, and his topics and style are completely different. A good book, but know what you are really getting."
2,I guess I do not like it that much for the reasons ....,"well, the title is quest for meaning .... what I read are just simple stories and fables nothing reflect the so called ""the meaning and the quest"".. disapointed !!"
4,Big and toasty!!,"This thing is huge, my wife and I had no problems staying comfortable - the bag is so big it takes a little while to warm up from body heat, but once warm - you never want to get out! Two reasons I didn't give it 5 stars was the zipper was not the really big one you see on high quality bags and the stuff sack could have been a touch bigger to make it easier to repack. In spite of those drawbacks, I would still recommend it for the price to friends."
1,pretty good item,I actually gave this item 4 stars but somehow it reverted back to the 1-star. The sleeping bag is very comfortable and warm. A little tight for two average adults. The bag is a PIECE OF WORK getting it back into it's sleve. I gave up and now use the pouch for my single sleeping bag ... which is nice because the pouch has 2 sholder straps.
3,"Great Price, but Excessive Drill/Driver Run Out","My initial pleasure with this value-priced made-in-Mexico combo turned sour once I put bits in the drill: the most run out I have ever seen in any drill at any price. Even my cheap old Ryobi has virtually no run out, and it's from Chiwan! I guess the Mexicans have a way to go to match the stellar build quality coming out of the Far East.I've contacted DeWalt through their email form, but I've heard they apparently don't do anything except cheerfully apologize and hope you'll go away.So my options are to keep it or send it back to Amazon and never see the great price again. The nailer seems to work fine, but the drill will never be anything more than a fancy screw gun. With the run out it wobbles and shakes while drilling and the hole is neither where you wanted it nor the size you expected."
4,Very enjoyable,"This recording is really fun to listen to, cranked up on a very high-quality sound system, especially the haunting Duel of the Fates. I also bought a recording of The Planets by Gustav Theodore Holst, and I can hear a lot of the same themes from that composition being repeated in this Star Wars soundtrack. I believe that is where a lot of the inspiration came from."
4,"Great, but not perfect","I like the music in this CD alot, cuz i love Star Wars, but there are a few complaints i have. First and foremost is the lack of organization. I wish they would have put the music in order, and even maybe titled the music correctly. For instance, the Arrival at Naboo in track one starts out that way, then goes into the arrival at Coruscent. Then there was the missing music. I was really mad they left off the music that played as Anakin said goodbye to his mother. A great piece that would have been an asset to this CD. And finally, the final track. Unlike alot of people, i liked Augie's Municipal Band, i just hated what came next. He just threw together the finale, basically putting the Star Wars theme, then tracks 2 and 3 in there entirety. He should have done it the way he did for the other movies where they play part of the songs, not the whole thing. But other than that, i can't stop listening to this CD."
5,yeah baby!,"This CD is awesome. I am too young for the original Star Wars, but I remember John Williams from many movies such as ""Schindler's Lsit""..(which was very good as well). I have played the clarinet for almost 7 years now and I sit and listen to this in awe of what it would feel like to record this under John Williams. I love the rhythms and everyting about it, as a musician I appreciate it so much more!"
2,A mixed bag,"Who was the heartless soul who released this CD? The music is good, but please, where are the pictures, where are the liner notes, where is the music?!? I have the original soundtrack on vinyl of the Empire Strikes Back, it has a greater percentage of the movie's music on it, a great many pictures and notes on every track. Much like the SW:ANH special edition double CD. Why did we get cheated on this CD and get something so mediocre? I am thorougly dissapointed by this package, though I do like the music very very much."
3,Lives up to the movie,For any Star Wars fan TPM did not live up to the expectations of the first three movies and the soundtrack follows suit. John Williams is of course brilliant again in the next chapter of the Star Wars saga but I was sadly disappointed by the CD. First of all one of the titles of the tracks gives away a huge plot secret that really ruined the ending of the movie for me. Duel of the Fates is by far the best track on the CD. Anakin's theme is not as catchy as Yoda's or Princess Leia's theme from the earlier soundtracks. Not the best Star Wars soundtrack but then again TPM isn't the best Star Wars movie.
3,"No character development in the movie, and none in the music","The CD is quite dull, and Lucas is to blame, not Williams. Lucas didn't develop characters at all in Phantom, so Williams had precious little to cling to when trying to develop compelling musical themes for each character the way he did in the originals. If the movie was a parody of the original Star Wars and a rude joke that Lucas has played on real Star Wars fans, Williams did the best he could to make the CD half respectable. I'm not expecting anything else worthwhile to come out of the Lucas/Williams collaboration."
5,STAR WARS IS BACK,I must say that this is the best soundtack to date. The songs are wonderfuly done espeacialy Duel of the Fates and Anakin's Theme those were very good. As I'm writting this I'm listening to the Phantom Mance now and it is wonderful. The London Voices are outstanding. I've listend to it about 4 times today and I'll probley listen to it about 4 million times more. John Williams is the best music composer of are time. And I can't wait till the next soundtrack to the other Star Wars films come out. If I can give it ten stars I would.....
2,"GREAT score, Album is a SELLOUT","This CD is a horrific example of what happens when great music meets bad record label. No tracks on this CD are intact, are are fragments carelessly strewn around. This is due to the carelessness and arrogance of Sony Classical. After a 5 million dollar buy on Sony's part, Williams and Lucas decided to sell out their classical work. It contains no portions of Qui-Gons theme or the briefly stated (new for episode 1) Obi-Wan's theme. This album should have gotten the 2 CD RCA victor treatment like the Special editions soundtracks did. I was shocked. I DEMAND, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER FANS- A TWO CD SET!"
3,Williams and Star Wars rock once more.... Almost.,"""Duel of the Fates"", ""Anakin's Theme"", and the ""Augie"" piece are all examples of how awesome John Williams can be and still is. But what happened to the ""Force Theme"" in this installment? Okay, so this IS a different generation than that of the first three films, but should The Force be any different? Nearly all traces of the ""Force Theme"" (probably the most moving and powerful motif to come out of the first three films), as well as the general ""Star Wars Theme"" (as heard in the ""Main Title"") are nowhere to be found in the main body of the score. The lack of these essential elements makes most of this soundtrack a bland, un-engaging disappointment. Does this remind anyone of how the actual FILM turned out to be, after so much hype? My fingers are crossed, however-- John Williams (and George Lucas) have TWO more chances with Episodes II and III... to prove that Star Wars, and the music that defines it, AREN'T dead."
5,Williams Knows What He's Doing....,"The new STAR WARS score for EPISODE I - THE PHANTON MENACE is nothing short of spectacular. ""Duel of the Fates"" is the best match of music and visual ever constructed for a SCI-FI film. Not only do we get a battle scene for the ages, we get music to match. Anyone in their right ""SITH"" mind will get the track and remember how versatile John Williams (our best film composer, bar none) really is. Oscar nominee, no doubt about it, come FEBRUARY."
5,John Williams' is a genious!!,"My mom bought me the soundtrack to The Phantom Menace and I immediately played the CD on my computer, loving it! Williams' music is unwordly and superb! His themes are new, to introduce a new feel of the current state of the Star Wars' universe, but adds dashes of foreshadowing of what lies ahead. In every track you can picture what is happening in the story. In the appropriate tracks, you can actually feel being underwater. It's hard to explain, really. I am 16 and feel honored to experience what my parents did in the 70's. I love Star Wars and was not dissapointed one bit with the new films. Lucas and Williams will shine on in my heart forever..."
4,"The ""FORCE""...behind the music!","A wonderful score! I commend John Williams on another winner! Especially the ""Duel of the Fates"" (track 02) and the last track (track 17)! Movie scores have always inspired and motivated me especially those from the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies! Highly Recommended!"
3,Am I listening to the same CD?,"Sadly, like the reviews of the film itself, Williams's score pays more attention to the landscape and not enough to the characters and their conflicts beyond his usual boom, crash, boom. That said, I'm still impressed by the exquisite orchestration displayed in the transitional material. With central themes, like Anakin's and Jar Jar, cobbled togethor from Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf however, I'm not inclined to rave as many reviewers so readily have."
4,Great masterpiece with nevertheless a few tweaks,"John Williams is one of my favorite composers, even surpassing composers like Copland and Stravinsky. I've grown up listening to these Star Wars tunes and never get bored with them. The only thing that was not very satisfactory was the pieces' dissonance & extreme dynamics. Sometimes it is just too hard to listen to the CD without turning the volume a couple of notches. Then suddenly a loud passage appears, completely blowing my ears off. Its rather dissonant harmony and twisted melody fit the theme, but may be difficult for some listeners to actually enjoy it. Aside from all these minor things, another masterpiece from John Williams. Bravo!"
4,"Good, Bad, I'm the Guy with the lightsaber.-TheJediWill","The CD is overall good, some of the songs are really impresive with the changes in tempo, volume, and overall the music is similar to A New Hope Soundtrack. The Duel of Fates song is great, the choir and music is a perfect compliment to the Star Wars music."
2,Terrible CD- But wait! There's more!,"Let me start by saying how truely terrible THIS presentation of the score is. It lacks any sort of coherence and LOTS of additional music. While it serves as a listening experience on it own and seperate from the film, you later watche the film and realize you've been robbed. Help is on the way! It would seem Sony Classical came to their senses (and woke up to the fact that they spent too much money for the rights to the score and did not move enough copies) and announced that they will be releasing a full score in November. So you have a choice (a choice that I do not have anymore - because I bought this inferior CD the day it came out) you can buy this now,... or you can wait until a full score is released and experience the music as it should be."
3,Good but Not Great,"John Williams has written some great music in his time, and although his soundtrack to Star Wars I is quality, it is not my favorite. The best tracks are 2, 12 and 14. Track 12 is reminiscent of the astroid chase scene in Empire- very good stuff.Also interesting is the way Williams has incorporated a theme from the earlier movies into this one, slightly altered. All in all, a good piece of music great for a reading soundtrack."
2,A disappointment,"There is nothing memorable about this sound track. None of the characters have a theme that you will find yourself humming later, though several characters (Watto, Sebulba and especially Qui Gon) deserve a strong and recognizable theme, in my opinion. I also question the ordering and pairing of the tracks on the CD. They are not in the order they come in the movie. If you are familiar with other sound tracks by John Williams, you might hear echoes of Close Encounters, Superman, Indiana Jones, and Jaws. The strongest piece is ``Duel of the Fates'' and you will catch pieces of the Force Theme and the Empire March from the previous movies, which is nice. But all in all not a soundtrack I will listen to often."
5,This sound track reminded me of John Williams' other scores,"I Thought that this sound track was excellent. It was different from the other Star Wars sound tracks, but at the same time, it had a familiar flavor. It reminded me of some of John Williams' other film scores. But not just John Williams scores. ""Dual of the Fates"" has the style and excitement of Joel McNeely's score for Shadows of the Empire."
2,Please Forgive Me John,"I'm sorry, but this score is not what you are expecting from a Star Wars film. Remember how intense the music from the trailer was? Well, it's entirely absent from this soundtrack. I think that the score to the Lost World is better than than this one. If you've heard it, you can make the comparison."
5,I loved this CD!,"If you like John Williams or previous Star Wars Cd's, then you'll love the Phantom Menace. I didn't want to listen to it until I saw the movie but i couldn't resist. I just sat and listened to it for 74 minutes straight. Very captivating. Buy it!!!"
3,Williams Phones It In...,"When listening to Duel of the Fates, I often have to check and make sure that I haven't popped in a CD from the Indiana Jones Trilogy. Modern movie music, much like movies themselves, may be devoid of innovative and creative energies (opting instead for proven (read:stale) products), but in a moment of supreme irony, Williams cribs off himself. Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars, and this album is not ""bad,"" it just lacks inspiration. Its five parts Star Wars, four parts Raiders/Temple of Doom, and two parts Danny Elfman. Also, there is a huge spoiler among the song titles (not an unexpected plot element, but still...)"
4,Classic John Williams and an excellent score.,Its Back! I was 10 when episode 4 came out and it started me on my hobby of collecting film scores. This score is excellent but not long enough. My favorite is the piece called Duel of the Fates. It has an Orff like quality to it and conveys the battle between light and dark.The Appearance of Darth Maul sounds very much like the emperors theme from episode 6.All in all a very enjoyable CD. I hope the Lucas / Williams collaboration continues with the next 2 films. A fine addition to the Star Wars universe.
2,very confusing cd jus like the movie,I bought this cd thinking as most soundtracks collectors do that it would be a set in order like his other star wars cd/special editions. What I got was a confsing cd totally out of order from the movie!!Other than it ok if you can find out the ways the numbers should be on this confusing cd !!BTW it still great music!!!
3,Somehow missing the grandeur of the original.,"Before Star Wars, there was the Phantom Menace, and before tPM there was the soundtrack, which had the unfortunate problem that it ruined a large part of the ending by revealing Qui-Gonn's death.John Williams did a wonderful thing when he established the major themes in the original Star Wars soundtracks. Unfortunately tPM soundtrack seems to lack this sort of definite organization. The tunes are not nearly as memorable as the other soundtracks, which leaves a lot to desire in a movie soundtrack. Still, Williams is an excellent composer and any chance to listen to his work is a welcome chance."
4,The Four Stars are a preliminary. I want to see the movie.,"John Williams is great, but Duel of the Fates sounds alot like Danny Elfman's Ride of the Batmobile for _Batman_."
2,Missing So Much,"Don't get me wrong, the music thats actually on this score is really great. The problem is what is missing, so much of the music in the film is not on the soundtrack. Plus, what is on the soundtrack is out of sequence with the film. I don't understand how the original trilogy had more than complete soundtracks and this one seems to be thrown together randomly. Really a dissapointment as far as the quantity. The music of John Williams deserves better."
5,Inspiring.,"William's score is an excellent complement to the movie. Tracks 14-16 played back to back convey the movie's feel. I could have done without Jar jar's theme but besides that, this CD is a testament to William's greatness."
3,A Mild Disappointment,"I just got back from seeing the movie and I loved how the score worked with the movie. it works really well with the film but the actual score is pretty forgettable. It really is. The themes aren't anything I could sing back to you except for ""Duel of the Fates"" and "" Anakin's Theme"" and the only reason I could sing Anakin's theme back to you is because the end of it has the Imperial March from the previous films. Forgettable scores have their place but Star wars is something that should strike you emotionally. This score will not. Not unless you convince yourself it will. This is not a score to buy but it is a score to be seen with one truly extraordinary movie. That's just my opinion- I only study film score."
3,Disappointment,"After reading the reviews here, and seeing the video running in MTV, I decided to purchace this CD hoping that it would contain some great tunes just like it's predecessors by John Williams.This is a typical soundtrack with great music FOR A MOVIE but not that great for easy listening at home. The score does a great job describing the battle between the Kungan and the droids. But, as I said, you will want to BE IN THE CINEMA listening this, not at home. There are no easy melodies to whistle to, not a single tune you can easily remember. This is not what I expected to hear from a STAR WARS soundtrack... I was hoping to learn some new powerful tunes to use at my big entrances."
4,It's OK,"It's nice. But the ""base themes"" (if you know what I mean) are missing. I am talking about the Imperial March and Luke's Theme, etc. I though the music in the trailer sounded better. This was an OK soundtrack, but ""Star Warsie"" enough (Where the heck is the Fox Fanfare???)."
4,Longer ago and further away....,"Ten years ago, STAR WARS came back in the form of THE PHANTOM MENACE. And I was one of the first to go out and purchase the eagerly awaited soundtrack by John Williams.Needless to say I was in awe! Even after I saw the movie and was subsequently disappointed, I was still enamored by this music. Although ""Duel of the Fates"" felt a little out of place in the Star Wars universe (don't get me wrong, it's an awesome piece of music), it eventually grew on me, especially after getting incorporated into the succeeding prequel scores, ATTACK OF THE CLONES and REVENGE OF THE SITH.I still think the soundtrack would have been improved if John Williams had used more of the Tatooine themes from A NEW HOPE (perhaps excerpts from ""Binary Sunset"" or ""Mos Eisley Spaceport"").But after ten years, it's much more Star Wars-ish to me now than it once was. It's still a fun musical adventure, full of excitement and wonder.Par for the course for John Williams."
2,Disappointing - if you'll notice the details,"First, the track arrangemnt dosen't make any sense. Second, this CD contains pieces that were CUT OFF, and lacks so much of the finalized soundtrack found in the movie. Just listen to the first track ""Arrival at Naboo"" and then compare it to the movie. Listen to ""The Droid Invasion"" (my favorite piece in the movie) and compare it to the movie, it's different on the CD!. SOME OF THE GOOD MATERIAL WAS LEFT OUT, and the order of the tracks does not match the sequence in the movie.It seems they had made this CD before the movie was even edited. Although it has the music on it, this CD was a complete disappointment for me, and if you'll notice the details - I'm sure you will agree with me."
4,Star Wars Soundtrack... It is what it is,"Purchased this soundtrack simply to record a couple of tracks from it. Not into classical musit, therefore it is what it is."
1,what a piece of poo,The main theme of this album is obviously star wars and thus I expected to hear strong emotive music what I heard was like listening to the ELO and Jean Michel Jarre on speed.
3,It leaves me feeling incomplete.,"""I have been listening to the 'Star Wars' film scores since I was a boy-(what film music buff hasnt?)In fact,John Williams's music was the reason I began to do so in the first place.His scores kept getting better and bigger,until with the 'Empire Strikes Back'score,he reinvented the wheel as far as 'Star Wars'was concerned,and I never thought he could top that.I'm sorry to say I dont think he has with 'The Phantom Menace'.Dont get me wrong-'The Duel Of The Fates'is ambitious and awe inspiring,but the score as a whole felt incomplete.'The Force' theme should have been much more prominent,and 'Yoda's Theme'makes only the briefest of appearances.And to top it off,the'End Title' cue ended rather anticlimactically without the return to the 'Main Title' fanfare at the pieces end.Hopefully,the second disc(which must be forthcoming)will have more of the traditional Williams punch, a'la''The Asteroid Field' or 'The Duel'."
5,New Star Wars soundtrack is a work of art,"This Soundtrack is another great work from John Williams. The new themes introduced set the tone for the new trilogy, and the some of the old themes are also woven in. Exciting tracks, such as Panaka and the Queen's Protectors and Droid Invasion, add punch to the music, while slower, harmonious ballads, like Anakin's Theme, calm and entrance. Most of all, the new Star Wars theme, Duel of the Fates, is worth the price of the CD. It stands on its own as a great musical piece of the times. This soundtrack is a great work."
3,OK with some really good parts,"After you've listened to a few of John Williams' albums they all start to sound similar, and the ""Phantom Menace"" is no exception. The album sounds a lot like a mix of Star Wars and Indiana Jones, with a dash of E.T. for flavor. However, to its credit it doesn't repeat a lot of the themes included in the soundtracks for the first three movies, and pieces like ""Duel of the Fates"" and ""The Droid Invasion"" make it worth the buy."
3,Dissapointing,"This soundtrack is quite a departure from the Star Wars series. I expected specific themes for each character. Unfortunately, Anakin and the film's theme were all I got. This score was treated like one part of a whole, while the original trilogy's music was intertwined and fluid throughout the series. There are two good tracks: ""Duel of the Fates"" and ""Anakin's Theme"", and, while the latter is almost worth the price of the cd, it's just not enough for a Star Wars soundtrack. The final medley, featured in every Star Wars soundtrack, is only a compilation of the two aforementioned themes in their entirety. If the score is this shallow, I can't imagine how weak the movie might be."
2,Not so great....,"The Star Wars episode 1 soundtrack really isn't so great. Most of the tracks are fairly boring, and the exciting ones aren't really worth your money. Get Episode 3; it's far better than this one."
2,Is this Kidz Bop or Star Wars?,"This soundtrack is pathetic compared to the old trilogy and the Episode III soundtrack.While ""Duel of the Fates"" ""The Droid Invasion"" and ""The Sith Spacecraft"" are excellent, most others like ""Anakin's Theme"" Jar Jar's Introduction"" and ""Augie's Municipal Band"" are terrible. The band one is so retarded! There are people singing idiotic lyrics as children laugh. The rest non-kiddie tracks are totally bland, boring junk that doesn't deserve the name ""Star Wars.""DO NOT believe the 5 star reviews. If you do, you'll just get buyers remorse."
3,"Its okay, I guess","Well, I'm not exactly a Star Wars fan (I'm a Trekkie), so my viewpoint may not be objective enough. The songs on this CD seemed to me to be repetitions of the same lyrics from the first three movies. Those were easy to liten too, had some feeling, etc. However, this does not. In fact, the only song I really enjoyed on this CD was the last scene music, not just because it was the end of the CD."
3,"Good, though lacking in the ""Force""--3 1/2 stars","I bought the CD after seeing Star Wars for the third time, wanting to hear specifically three different scenes: (in order] 1) the intense play of the ""Force theme"" when Qui Gon shoved his saber through the blast door, ""This is Impossible!!"", 2) the force theme when Anakin says fairwell to his mother, ""Don't look back..."", and 3) the choral/strings during the lightsaber duels and attack on the Palace/control ship. The first two were not on the CD (as far as I could hear) and the third is broken apart and has large gaps. I think the force theme is the best theme in the Trilogy's soundtracks, which is why I love ""Binary Sunset"", the second movement in ""The Battle of Yavin"" and ""The light side"". However, the cd is really good besides. The choral essambles in ""Duel of Fates"" remind me a lot of those in ""The Hunt for Red October"""
4,Great but not excellent (just like the movie),"For the most part, John Williams has done it again, composing a brilliant score for Star Wars: Episode One. The new opening theme after the Star Wars theme was filled with excitement, as were Duel of the Fates, Panaka and the Queen's Protectors, and Qui-Gon's Noble End. Tracks like Anakins theme hinted at bits of the future, and that was also fun to listen to. Augie's Municipal Band captures a spirit which is new, but sounds much like the original ROTJ celebration song. Likewise, track 14 with its army-like march was cool but too reminicent of Indiana Jones' Nazi theme. Definitely worth the buy, if only the tracks had been arranged in some kind of order, like the special edition reprints."
5,John Williams is a GENIOUS,"I've been a fan of John's work since I was a little kid and saw the first StarWars in the theater. The music on the new film is no exception. Beautiful string arrangements, excellent rhythms, complex counterpoint, and opera vocals make up the massive soundscapes. My old keyboard player wrote John Williams a letter when he was 13 years old and John wrote him back in ink. I can't imagine getting a letter from John in the mailbox. He is truly one of the greatest composers of all time!!"
5,John Williams is the greatest!,"His talent is always great to hear in the movies or on soundtrack. Each and every track on this album was written well and I enjoy listening to all of it. I only found one problem with it which is the same in the movie. Toward the end, when Qui-gon's funeral is going on, they have sad melodic music playing, then a few seconds later there's a big happy parade going on with laughing and joyful music just after that."
4,"Different, but still good","The music of The Phantom Menace, is quite similar to the original Star Wars soundtracks, and yet completely different all at once. I still consider it a classical style, yet it is more contemporary than the previous Star Wars soundtracks. True, this album leaves out a great portion of the music used in the film, but the music on the CD is fun to listen to, and every track oozes with emotion (like most John Williams recordings)."
5,STAR WARS? - NOT without John Williams,"Probably the greatest living contemporary American composer, John Williams brings life and emotion to all movie soundtracks. I believe George Lucas animates Williams' scores, instead of the other way around; otherwise, Star Wars would just be another science fiction series."
4,The Begining of the Prequils,"I bought this one to complete my collection of all of the SW Soundtracks, it plays okay but is not my favorite, except for Duel of the Fates. It also doesn't have CD Text Capablility, not the best one prefer OE Trilogy and EP. 3 but good to have to complete your collection."
5,Worthy of the Star Wars Legacy,"Once again, John Williams has given us an excellent score. The ""Duel of the Fates"" tract is fantastic and is perfect for the background in the final duel between Obi-Wan and Darth Maul.Anyone who loved the original trilogy music should enjoy this one as well. I give this one 10 stars!"
3,Not what one would expect...,"I have spent the past week listening to the Return of the Jedi soundtrack, and am still in awe of John's ability to make the music invoke the movie, and not the other way around. Just like the movie, though, The Phantom Menace soundtrack disappoints. It has the sound of typical Williams ""filler"" music, like we hear in the dead parts of the Indiana Jones trilogy. It is missing the elements of instrumentation that musically depict the accompanying celluloid. And it tends to force dramatic themes, ostensibly full and loud in minor keys to say ""here, this part is scary,"" and thinner and major (or dominant), save for the Imperial March quote in Anakin's Theme, to tell you that the happy parts are here. It is unfortunate that a movie this mediocre has been slapped with the Star Wars franchise tag, but almost criminal that an average soundtrack be given the same treatment."
5,Williams ceases not to amaze.,"In another amazing score by the world's best composer, John Williams impresses the world with an exciting rendition of his score for the Phantom Menace. Williams proves his worth again, with strong songs such as ""Duel of the Fates"", however the only mistake seems to be the final track, with ""Augie's Municipal Band"" destroying the effect. This album is, however, worth purchasing by a large margin."
5,"Possibly one of the greatest scores in the ""Star Wars"" saga","Although ""Duel of the Fates"" is the obvious favorite on the recording, the other scores are written well also. ""Duel of the Fates"" captures the all-around feel of that final battle between Qui-Gon Jin, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul. It seems to capture your soul and take it for the ride of your life. Excellent!"
5,The Force is still with John Williams!,Another amazing score by John Williams. He has somehow managed to keep elements from the original Star Wars Trilogy while at the same time presenting something completely different. An excellent job of sweeping dramatic music that ranges from touching joyful celbration to dark and sinister pieces that will make your skin crawl. A definite must for even the lightest Star Wars fans.
4,"Nice, but not as good as Return of the Jedi","The return of the jedi had more of the star wars themes i liked, i wish this had at least the imperial march!!! whocan do with out the imperial march!!! liked it though!"
2,The Phantom Menace score is missing what makes Star Wars,"I realize that this is a whole new trilogy and a lot has changed, many might think it wrong to compare this score with the old trilogy, but I don't see how you cannot. The score to the Phantom Menace doesn't even sound like Williams did it. In the original trilogy, the music for each character fit them so well. What we have now is more so music to fit what is happening in the movie. What I missed most was the single melody that was present in almost every piece that bound them all together. This consistency that made the original trilogy music so great is not present in this new score. So it is with regret that I give this CD a score of 2 stars. My only hope is with the next two films, they bring back the formula that made the original trilogy score so powerful and moving."
1,The Worst Video Phone I have used,"The video and sound are the worst qualities. You must use the handset. It is full of echo when you use the speaker phone function. Although the screen is 5"", the resolution is low and bad when you use the full screen. You have to shrink it to smaller screen (3"") to have better veiw. I switch to use Skype video phone and it has a lot better sound and video qualities. Also, Skype is more easy to set up. No any ports need to open in your router. Just plug and set up your account."
1,Under delivered,"I bought the unit for my parents, but tested it on my own local network first. The intent was to use Microsoft NetMeeting to connect to the D-Link device using H.323 standard IP communication, something that on the D-Link website they say they support.Despite it being relatively easy to set-up, assuming you understand something about routers, the product totally under delivered on sound and video quality. Video was very grain and did not adapt to changing light conditions very well. And the sound was absolutely useless; very garbled and totally unintelligible. There are no settings that can be used to adjust sound quality.The only positive point was the ease with which Amazon accepted the return and reimbursed the cost."

5,Excellent Texas Book!,Being a native Texan and a former history I found this to be aninteresting book.The book tells of Remy Fuqua moving to Texas tostart his life.Once in Texas he marries Beatrice the daughter ofwealthy Mexican parents.Together they have three children.Hiswife and two of his sons are seized by a feirce Comanche chief bythe name of Kills White Bear.Remy rescues his wife and one of his sons.Once home Beatrice has a child that has been fathered by Kills White Bear.Remy rides with Sam Houston and does battlewith Mexican bandits and the Comanche Indians.He later has aconfrontation with Kills White Bear.A very well written fictionbook that sounds like actual history.Read this book.You will havea better grasp of the early days of Texas.
5,"If you're not from Texas, it will help you understand us.","If you are from Texas, you'll recognize your ancestors, family, friends. This book captures the flavor of Texas complete with the contradictions, class warfare, cultural warfare and intermingling of various cultures that is our greatest asset, and at times, our greatest challenge. This author snares your interest and will keep you up late at night reading just one more chapter. At least that's what happened to me."
2,This is no Lonesome Dove.,"This book was recommended to me after I expressed a strong liking for Lonesome Dove and a biography of Sam Houston. I read the reviews and many likened it to McMurtry's Lonesome Dove. What?!? Not even close. In comparison, the characters are poorly developed and not believable. The book is okay, but no where near great."
3,Epic but not Classic,"Really expected a Michener type novel. While a good story and a comfortable read, the writing doesn't reach that level."
4,Its not a toy >.>,"Amazon is callin it a toy! its a MODEL! Not a toy!Anyways, Carnifex: The living tank - 160 points per model w/ dual Scything talons, or mine with Crushing Claws and a Heavy Venom Cannon for 210. A brutal close-combat engine of destruction, hard to kill with 6 toughness and a 3+ Armor save, with 9 strength to make it a terror to vehicles and infantry alike. Get it into close combat with Crushing Claws giving +D3 extra attacks, and youll find him worth every point, although if you were to have a tossup between the Carnifex or a Trygon, the Trygon will put out a lot more hurt."
3,"Great band, lousy lyrics....","I've had this cd for about a year and am just getting around to reviewing it. When I first listened to it, I could not believe the musicianship. Absolutely stellar! This is gritty, electrified blues of the first order. And with a lead singer who sounds like Eric Burdon to boot! The only problem is the lyrics to most of the songs stink to high heaven. I know, I know--this is the blues, not poetry fer Chrissakes! Well, if you enjoy the same phrase repeated over and over again ad infinitum one song after the other--this cd is for you! Despite the authenticity and high standard of the music, the one phrase songs become more and more irritating...They have won some awards and have a new cd out now...but I am wary..."
2,A little disappointed,"I hate to trash any product because I'm sure every book is meant for someone; however I was disappointed in this book. If you know how to meditate on the chakras and are familiar with the different types/definitions of psychic abilities, there is no reason to buy this book. This seems to be informationt that you can get online for free. I like John Holland so I thought I'd enjoy the bonus CD. The bonus CD contains two chakra meditations, nothing spectacular."
2,My psychic abilities say Don't buy this!,"Has affirmations and exercises that are supposed to help you develop your psychic abilities, which all people are born with. Basic stuff you could find through a quick Google search. I am disappointed in John Holland's general information in this book, after all he is supposed to be one of the best psychics in the world. The information in this book is basic information, including his story, that every psychic says.Not worth the money!"
1,John Holland,"I can't find the product I want and to research it is near imposible!! I want the CD on Chakra Clensing.was toldit was good and good for me as well...... but, finding it on line is the pits. Where in the world are you hiding it?"
2,Take Some Advice From The Third Song...,"Here's some heavy advice from The Dipper. Send this CD single to Kim Il Jong, the weasel leader of North Korea. It has a MOVIE on it. Dear Leader is bananas about movies (and also is just plain bananas). He will watch this CD over and over, listening to the schmaltzy, vapid piffle called ""Forever & Always"" until his skull goes supernova. The world will then be a much finer (and snazzier) place all because you bought this horrific CD and did the right thing by getting it off the North American continent. Consider it your Yankee Doodle Dandy responisibility to make fun of this trash as often and as brutally as possible. Better yet, buy this CD used so Shania doesn't get an even bigger head and thinks she has talent and puts out more of this schlock. Remember: it's all about song number three...."
4,perfect fit for those interersted in sports,Lupica books are great fits for middle school students who enjoy sports and and a good book about youths overcoming odds to succeed
5,Very good and enjoyable,This is a great book for young and old. The story is touching and refreshing. Baseball fan or not you will love it. Highly recommended.
2,Why most kids hate reading.,"Frankly, kids shouldn't be reading this in 8th grade. They should be reading The Count of Monte Cristo, or Ender's Game, or the original Sherlock Holmes stories. Books like Heat and Twilight should be read in Elementary School, but thats where the line should be drawn. Short, Tween books like Heat are brainwashing American children into thinking that any book over 300 pages will be boring incomprehendible drivel. Even in High School, adminostatrers encourage kids to read these books that take a 5th grader half an hour to read. If you are a parent, DON'T buy this for your kid! Buy them Ender's Game or the 3 Musketeers. Challenge them!On a side note, most sports books seem generally the same. Kid plays sport, kid goes through emotional struggle, kid gets big chance, kid scores winning point \ goal \ shot. Blah, blah, boring."
1,abysmal,"In one of the great all-time perversions of celebrity, Mike Lupica, sports columnist turned novelist, has perpetrated an incredible hoax: somehow, on his sheer ""charisma,"" he's built a reputation for having something interesting to say, and, more remarkably, as a writer of some talent and significance. The reality is that Lupica has never had fresh, original takes on anything. His distinction, if he has one, is to be about the dullest, most insipid, prose writer ever to earn a living pumping out copy. The success and glowing reviews of his latest, brutal novel is just another persuasive argument that, sometimes, ""image is everything."" Lupica, the heterosexual Richard Simmons, does have one indisputable talent: self-promotion. As a writer, he's an unmitigated disaster, and those who argue otherwise are either deluded or simply enjoy reading on a third-grade level."
4,Fun and thrilling,"I loved ""Heat"" because of all the great things it had inside of it. Heat is about a 12 year old baseball player named Michael Arroyo who lives in New York City. He is a very good pitcher in the city league. The main theme of the story is that he is too good for his league. The coaches in his league wonder if he is older than the rest of the league. Once this problem comes upon Michael, he has is asked to show the league his birth certificate so they can make sure he is the same age as everyone else. But problems fall like rain on Michael and he cannot give them the certificate because he has lost both of his parents and only has his brother for his family. Michael has to get all the help he can to get past the coaches who are so curious. Michael cannot live without baseball so he will try anything and everything to get it back.Heat is a book for ages 10 and up. Heat is a fun book that all sports fans will adore. Heat has thrills!--Kyle Dickson"
1,Item was not as described,"A book described as new had no dust jacket although one was shown in the photograph, the hard back was dirty and a page corner was turned back and creased. It was not at all as described. I would not order from this seller again."
2,Heat,"The author is trying to be a Tom Clancy type of author by taking a number of pages to explain one fact. The story line is good, when you can remember what it was. Should be more baseball action and less talk about the same subject.My favorite books when I was growing up were the chip Hilton series, written be Clair Bee. They all had good story lines, but had one thing in common, they also talked sports. Mr Lupica gets away from this in all his books, whereas he could be the modern day Clair Bee if he so chose."
4,Heat by Mr. Fuzzypants,"The book Heat by Mike Lupica is a great book about a boy named Michael Arroyo, from Havana. His parents are both dead and it is just he and his brother Carlos. Michael loves baseball and wants to make it to the Little League World Series. And he his the greatest player on his team, the only thing holding him back is that some coaches think he is not the age that he says he is and get him dispelled from the league. His best friend Manny and his brother help him try to get back in the league. Will Michael get back in the league? If he does how will he do it? To find out you have to read the book. I loved this book even though it was a little hard to get into, but it is definitely worth reading."
5,A must have book,"Okay, so it's not written in the chatty style that students prefer, but this book is really the best tool out there to provide a background for New Testament studies. The author has no agenda, no liberal or conservative spin. He has scoured the Mishnah and the Talmudic writings, which would otherwise take years to do, and crystallized them into a succinct and convenient package. Modern analyzes of ancient Palestine are generally based on modern sociological theories, and inevitably they disappoint, but Jeremias' material is derived solely from relevant source texts, and I know which I prefer. Anyone serious about understanding the society into which Jesus was born ought to purchase this book."
3,confused about this product,"I think there may be some mismatch in the db - the product details start off like this: ""Henry Threadgill is the kind of musician who gives Wynton Marsalis nightmares"" and go on to describe what is probably Cary the Day, an album by Threadgill. The reviews also seem to refer to that album.I'm a big fan of Threadgill, and this ain't him.It's kind of an interesting record though. Includes ""The Times They Are a Changin'"" in Dutch, as well as some interesting arrangements of other songs (original, and otherwise, I presume) in dutch."
4,pleasantly surprised,"i am actually surprised at how well this product has worked after spending much money on useless products. noticed improvements under my eyes in one day. have allergies, some crepiness under eye,puffy dark areas and fine lines. the next morning...no puffiness and dark areas. have been using 5 days and actually can see improvements in lines. also make-up does not settle in the lines while wearing under foundation. hope this continues to improve under eye lines. but very impressed so far."
3,Outgrows Quicklly,My little girl enjoyed this first (at 3 months) but soon grew bored (around 5 months). She got frustrated because she couldn't touch the objects under the plastic. The songs are nice. I don't know why they have the retail price of over $50. Walmart has it for $12. 87.
1,Flimsy! Beware!,"One of the snaps that connects the separate sections broke the first time we loaded this with ornaments and attempted to reconnect the sections. That renders the whole thing useless, because now we can't carry the assembled unit. As one of the other reviewers also noted, the flimsiness would likely cause the whole unit to separate while carrying it -- so perhaps our delicate ornaments were saved by the fact that this was SO flimsy we never even got to carry them in it ... hmmm, maybe I should give it 5 stars for saving my ornaments then? Nah."
1,Didn't even make it out of the store,"The concept of these storage boxes is great, but they just don't work. In fact, I couldn't even make it out of the store where I bought them without them coming un-snapped -- and that's when they were completely empty. Needless to say, I immediately returned them.The quality of these boxes is very poor. On many of the boxes in the store, the snap loops were broken off, and several of them were cracked in other places.I really liked the idea of clear, divided, flexible ornament storage, but sadly this Snapware set is not a good solution at all."
5,Easy to organize,"I love these ornament boxes. They keep things in a controlled place so that you can see them and not lose the ornaments. I have modified some of the dividers to include larger/longer ornaments as well. I have used these for two Christmas seasons and they still snap securely. It helps to make sure that the layer's edges are not bulging, since that will make them very difficult to snap securely."
3,Good But Not Great,"It's a great idea, but it still needs some work. I like that I can store my ornaments in a way that I can see them from the outside, and I like the way they snap together.What I would like to see is:1) some sort of divider (plastic or cardboard) that actually fits into the slots molded onto the interior sides of the crates. You can fit the cardboard inserts together to create various sizes of compartments in which to store ornaments (anywhere from 2 to 16 in each carton, depending on how many inserts you use and how you put them together), but even though there are slots in which to fit the inserts, the cardboard pieces are too short.2) something with a somewhat sturdier snap-on piece, so you can stack more than just 3 at a time without the whole kit-and-caboodle coming apart.3) (assuming (2) is done) the option of buying the individual crates separate from the lid, so you could purchase as many stacking crates as you wanted or needed, and stack them all up with just the one lid."
4,Almost Great,"This product is almost great, except the cardboard inserts do tend to bend, come apart or twist. However, this three-tiered box certainly holds many many ornaments. I like the convenience of the stackable trays, and haven't had any problems with the snaps coming unfastened. If you have any heavier ornaments, I'd suggest a flat tray system that won't be susceptible to damage."
3,pretty good,the storage space is flexible and easy to see. the latches that hold the layers together do not hold consistenly. i had to improvise and put a strap around the whole thing to hold it together
4,Not for fragile ornaments,"I use this to keep my less breakable ornaments. I haven't had any issues with it breaking or cracking, and the snaps have held up just fine, but unless you are individually wrapping your fragile ornaments, it isn't cushioning them at all, and I'd be afraid to put them in there. The dividers are just cardboard, but they work just fine for their purpose, and they can be used to make smaller or larger compartments. I wouldn't add more than the 3 layers to this, even though it's possible to do so."
2,Cardboard dividers aren't long enough!,"I bought these for Christmas ornament storage this year, and thought they were so great because they were compact and sturdy. Mine have stayed snapped (already put ornaments away that we didn't use) but the cardboard dividers don't even touch the sides of the boxes! I thought the little grooves on the sides held the dividers in place (another thing I liked) but they don't even reach the grooves. AND, they don't include directions on how to assemble the dividers, which if they had reached the sides of the box, would have seemed to be self-explanatory, but I couldn't figure it out at first. Disappointed."
4,"It's okay, but could be better","Purchased the Durex Intimacy Kit because it is such a good deal.The massager along cost about the same price as this package. But the massager is not really up to the standard, it is really loud and you have to recharge it often. But on other hand, the vibrating ring is a really fun toy that everyone should try it out, it is ingenius. By the way, mine came with a rebate form for $20.00, so the final price for this pckage is $29.99, make this a very very good deal. The rebate ends at 06/30/06!"
1,Junk,"I bought one of these: it failed after about one week. Wouldn't play in ""random"", and I couldn't get the unit turned off or extract my CDs. I rated it one star only because there is not a lower rating."
4,Technics SL-MC4,"We rated the Technics SL-MC4 four stars, after we started burning cd's at a much slower speed -- about 8x (on Apple Itunes.) Before that, we would have only given it two stars or less. Like some of the other reviews, it, too, would hang up toward the end of cd-r's.I hope this will help others whom are thinking about replacing their MC4 with another player (and after researching cd changers, I feel your pain.) We decided to keep ours, at least, for now."
3,great deal for the money,the only problem i have had with the unit is it has trouble with burned cds. usually if it won't play just burn another copy and usually it will do fine. i have had it for five years. it needs more features but for the price it is great.
5,Un clasico contemporaneo,"Ensayo sobre la ceguera fue la primera novela de Saramago que lei. El hombre es un genio. Facilmente te envuelve en el texto hasta hundirte en el mundo de la historia. Oracion tras tras parrafo tras capitulo -- Saramago es uno de los pocos escritos aun comprometidos con el arte de la literatura. Como estudiante de literatura contemporanea hispana, recomiendo esta novela como una verdadera obra maestra. Es una delicia de lectura."
4,Ok bag,"Quality looked better in the picture, but for this price I really can't complain. Very convenient for taking keybard around."
2,Doesn't reflect contemporary teaching,"Understand that TAN books has two primary markets: Those who are interested in texts of historical significance and those who believe that the church should not change its approach to the world as the world changes. This book is aimed at the second group. The central premise of this book is that the primary purpose of marriage is procreation and the raising of children, a view that the church developed in the 1920s when it first attempted to formulate a theology of marriage and had shed by the 1970s."
2,Presto 09982 Cord,The product wasn't all that great. The magnetic prongs wouldn't grip like they should.
1,Incompatible.,"I lost my cord during a household move, and the replacement did not work with my cooker. Bummer. Real bummer."
1,only 1/2 a cord?,"Does this include the portion that connects to the fryer itself? That is the part I need, I have the portion that goes into the wall and the picture only shows the portion I have. anybody know?"
5,Cord was received sooner than expected.,I received the Presto Magnetic Deep Fryer Cord in a very short period of time. It was the exact cord that I needed and my son was thrill that I could cook for him again. I will use this company again when I need something quick.
1,Not the pl1215.,Looks like a nice cord but it is not the pl1215 i needed. Do not believe Amazons search results when they claim this is the pl1215.
1,Poor drivers + weak hardware = worst USB device I have used,"We have tons of these drives, as they were the only ones originally available. Unfortunately we have nothing but troubles with them. They constantly stop working and the drivers do not make these drives as easy to use as a normal floppy.Thankfully the poor product's problems are (usually) easily solved. Every time you use the floppy you have to uplug it from the USB connection, wait, then re-plug it in. This seems to reset it and allows it to work for another 5 minutes. I would not reccomend this drive at all.On top of all of this, this is the ugliest contraption I have seen! It is HUGE and heavy for just a simple floppy drive.We now use VST's USB drive and have had much better luck with it. This drive is small, light, and seems to be much more robust."
5,The best jazz/swing drummer of all time,I'm not a big fan of Buddy Rich but for me being adrummer I respect the music and I love the style he had.I first saw this video at guitar center one day and theywere playing this video on the t.v.I was blown away just buywatching the video.Buddy played the snare drum like no bodyelse could and he was phoenominal.I'm more of a jazz/fusionlistener and I love the blues.But even if you don't likethe big band/swing music and if you don't like jazz either.I highly reccomend for every drummer to watch Buddy Rich.I found it better to watch the video's than to listen tohis album's.You can learn alot from watching the Buddy Richconcert video's.This video is awesome you have to own thisvideo and part 1 of this documentary of Buddy Rich.
5,the 'one and only' Buddy Rich,"The Buddy Rich video was fabulous. It captured the World's Greatest Drummer during a time of great acknowledgement and fame. If I were to suggest a video of any type, it would most definitely be this one!"
3,An interesting view from the recent past,This book includes a number of interviews with industry managers who were attempting to implement Lean Manufacturing several years ago. The most interesting message that might be derived from the collection is the contrast of outlooks in the range of actual experience. Those with the least actual experience present the most aggressive and optimistic expectations. Those with the most experience seem to have a much more humble and cautious outlook. The contrast illustrates the contrast between Japanese and American leadership cultures. It would be very interesting to follow-up on the actual experience since these interviews. My own experience with one of the interviewed manager/leaders who was attempting the most aggressive implementation showed that he didn't recognize his own blindness to the cultural differences that led to his failure.
3,Buy the complete work instead of this,"You shouldn't buy this book, instead you should buyLife After Life & Reflections On Life After Life (A Guidepost 2 in 1 Selection). It contains this work and Moody's first book on NDE's.As for the book itself, it covered the subject matter well. I enjoyed the accounts of different Near Death Experiences, but Moody spent only half the book relating them. I didn't enjoy the sections on how parts of historical or religious literature could be based on NDEs. I didn't enjoy him speculating (the 'reflections' part I guess) since he writes with a very fundamentalist mindset.Overall, an OK book that satisfied my curiosity."
3,Good stuff!,"A little tough to read. ""Quiz"" up front was a little ""off-putting."" Thorough and basically good marriage book."
2,Common Sense Packaged,"I got this as it was part of a package for our pre-marital counselling. It wasnt mind blowing, it was really common sense packaged. Some may find it useful though."
5,"Took six months to pick a phone, this one is ""IT""","I have had my W660I for a little while, I love it. The features are great and easy to use.The only thing I recommend is to prepare the music you want to load and restart computer before transfering. When you finish transfering files disconnect the USB connection(not the cable the USB communition) before unplugging USB cable from computer. ( If your resources are low and the computer locks up your phone may need to recover. When I plugged the USB cable and selected transfer file I got a white screen. To recover the phone I had to leave it like that for 30 min and it was ok, that worked for me. All in all the phone was worth the time to pick it. I would buy another one if something happen to it. Aslo, love light feature."
4,Awesome phone BUT BEWARE,"BEWARE THE WHITE SCREEN OF DEATH.Besides that, this *is* the best phone. Pretty dang cool too."
2,camera malfunction,"i have had this phone for less than 7 months now, but the camera is broken. i have neither dropped the phone nor harmed it in any way. the will take views but it will not actually take a picture. anybody experience this???"
1,White screen of death in first 3 days,"I got the phone on 31st July 06 and before I could even explore the features of the phone, with in 3 days, it crashed and did not recover ever.The worst thing is, I did not try doing anything fancy. I left the phone in the night at the table, and in morning when I picked it back, it was having the WHITE SCREEN. Power off etc did not work. Now, I am figuring out a way to exchange it."
1,Junk,"I have read all problems on the reviews and agree. Having problems with swivel head only had phone for 5 months. Get white screen, locks up only way out is to take out battery and re-boot. The only positive thing about this phone is the speaker and music storage, but hard to enjoy either when battery life is less than a day. THIS PHONE IS JUNK, CINGULAR KNOWS IT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT SELL IT NOR WILL THEY SEND THIS SAME PHONE OUT IF IT IS WARRANTIED, THEY ARE WARRANTING THIS PHONE WITH THE SAMSUNG D807. IF YOU ARE EXPIERENCING ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE, AND IF IT IS A CINGULAR BRANDED (LOCKED TO CINGULAR) AND YOU HAVE PURCHASED LESS THAN A YEAR AGO YOU CAN GET IT WARRANTIED WITH 15 MINUTES. CALL WARRANTY SERVICE 800-801-1101 AND GET THE SAMSUNG D807 STILL HAS THE 1.3MEGAPIXEL CAMERA, IT IS A VERTICAL SLIDE PHONE WITH A BIG SCREEN I LOVE THIS PHONE."
2,Just a toy ....,"Believe it or not.I bought this phone and after a perfectly valid operation with the USB cable, this phone competely went dead.The saving grace was the excellent customer service and the prompt replacement phone i got.Since I wanted to alter the ring tone to be able to differentiate this phone from the other similar phones around me, I tried using the USB cable again. The phone software just hung this time and now I only get a Sony Ericsson Logo on the screen.As a phone with all the bells and whistles, it is very nice only if the software that it uses was better programmed.I am not sure what kind of response I will get from the customer service this time but I do hope they remain ever courteous and do the needfulIn short, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SERIOUS USE."
4,Pretty good phone,"Ive had this phone for over a month now and so far I like it. The reception is great, i have no trouble except for in my building at work. Ive never had a phone get great signal in here. I like the simple alarm/organizer. I had the Motorola i860 before and you had to go thru too many steps just to set the alarm. The rotating feature takes getting used to, but u really dont need to open it unless you have to manually dial a number. My least favorite thing about the phone is the ringtones. There are no plain jane ring tones. I dont like music ring tones but what did expect from a walman phone? The good thing is that there is so much memory, i can download lots of standard type ringtones. The voice dial does not work with the blue tooth headset and the camera sucks.Overall i give it 4 stars cuz of the great signal strength, great alarm, easy to navigate, plenty of memory, radio sounds fantastic and a nice big screen."
2,Screwed up,"It is a rather nice phone, but after 6 months, the screws holding the faceplate to the swivel arm have come out. I don't want a phone that I need to rubberband to keep together."
4,It has its moments!,"First, the White Screen of Death Issue. I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular. I sent it back to SONY. NO more problems. They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine. The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer. However, wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro: Loud and easy to hear from.Con: Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro: The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con: Battery drain is bad, when you play the MP3 player."
1,Bad Phone,"I have owned 2 phone since December 2005. Since then, screws came loose in the swivel mechanism and the top half of the phone is about ready to fall off. The phone NEVER went through excessive heat and was never dropped, just by using the swivel it became detatched. It's hanging on by a single screw now.Sony fixed the screws on the first phone, and broke the light, and when they fixed the light the phone was not able to get any signals.I'm buying a nokia phones to replace my 2 phones."
3,It's pretty good,"I liked it, especially since it plays MP3's. However I did find some flaws, like how it will let you only have one number per person in the address book, so if u want someones home and cell in ur contact list u have to make their name twice. plus it is pretty bulky for a phone and the risk of the screen breaking in your pocket. it is semi-expensive but not too bad. i wouldn't reccomend it unless you really want the mp3 player"
3,Poor Battery Life!,"I purchased this phone from Cingular. My review will focus on battery life (or lack thereof). Yes, phone is wonderful. A little bulky but feature packed and great sound quality. Battery life is another issue. SE states ""up to"" 15 days of standy. Aparently, Cingular branded phones with the new firmware get 2-3 days MAX on standby. Don't expect anywhere near 15 days."
1,frustrating,I have had problem after problem with this phone. I've to send it back three times now because it keeps crashing and going into a blank white screen from which there is no return.
3,returned phone,"i was happy for 3 weeks and then a big disappointment.the good - i found the basic phone features (talking, listening) excellent, with very good signal strength. both bluetooth and speakerphone were great. the walkman feature and fm radio were also very good.the bad - the camera was below average - like some other comments, the pictures taken indoor were very fuzzy. outdoor pictures were better, but still below average sharpness/focus.the ugly - after three weeks, the USB connection froze the phone. the only way to reset was to remove and reinsert the battery. talked to cingular and sony ericsson, and was offered a replacement. the next day, COULD NOT EVEN TURN ON the phone -- so decided to return the phone and cancelled my plan (lucky for me, my disappointments came before 30 day trial period ended)"
3,All in one gadget but not a good cellphone,"HiI got this phone primarily looking for a good cell phone and nothing moreBut I was fancied by all the other items in this phone like fm radio, mp3 player, camera etc etcBut the call quality in this phone is no where close to my 3 year old lg-vx4400my old cell phone call quality is hundred times better than this oneI understand that the call quality depends on the signal strength which in turn depends upon the carrierI immediately returned this phone and got one nokia 6102lets see how does this nokia turn out to be?"
1,AMAZON SUCKS,Don't ever order thru AMAZON... they will not ship and will take a long time.. They will just say that have not got CREDIT APPROVAL from CINGULAR... But I called Cingular and learnt that my approval was done 10 days back but these cheaters will delay because they don't have in stock.
1,Extremely poor battery life,"I agree with S. Jarecki. Two days battery life, at least with the Cingular issued phones. Firmware is updated, battery replaced by Cingular. Sony Erickson can't explain the problem yet lots of us are experiencing this."
2,overrated,"This phone turns off when you don't want it to (like about 3-4 times per day), the buttons don't work well, the service is very slow, and poor (with this phone as opposed to cingular with my old phone), and the storage capacity for songs is very low--approximately one album at a time. Go for something better, at this price!"
5,Face Plates,Does it include a white faceplate..or only blue and orange? white wud be kinda cool looking!!
3,ZERO BATTERY LIFE!,"i love this phone and all its features BUT, my phone has to be plugged in daily or my battery goes kerplunk on me. even when i am not using the walkman!"
1,DO NOT GET THIS PHONE,"Absolutely, positively, do NOT get this phone. I have had 2 so far in the last 8 months. Both started acting weird, then shut off and NEVER came back on again. Cingular admitted to having many problms reported on this phone. Sony is supposed to be coming out with a new model - the 700 - but I doubt I will even bother with that. No matter how much you want the included MP3 player and/or FM radio- it will save you a bunch of potential trouble if you don't even get this phone."
5,ok phone - sucky battery,"phone sounds great, but...newer phones seem to have issues, checkout cingular.coms forum for a whole thread on this issue. When ordering, let the sales rep know that you have heard about this issue:very poor battery life. Phone purchased in NYC, US from Cingular Store on 5/22/06; battery does not last more than 30 hours, even in standby/non-use. Phone has: R7CA017 firmware, backlight is turned down lowest, I do not use the walkman feature,do not use IM, Web or other gprs svcs. avg 1 or 2 calls/day. Phone was charged for 12 hours before using, do not use bluetooth accessories. do not use camera much (1 picture every other day),Please advise. Can you provide a new battery or advise a long life battery? Can you provide new firmware?"
3,Pretty good phone but... bad power connection...,"Hi.The good:- Love that walkman have built a competitor to Apple. Rock solid sound; Good interface; blue tooth connection is superb; 3 speakers are superb. Great to relaxing in the tub :) Good pc connection software.The bad:- Got annoyed with the swivel aspect. Hard to do with one hand and heck, the novalty wore off quick.- Main issue, it powered off without warning. Think it is the power connection in the swivel joint. Sad mechanical error."
1,To expensive,I found the same thing for $3.99 on ebay. I almost always use amazon cuz I can get better deals and get my products in a timely manner. This price is ridiculous though. I'm talking about the stylus for a Toshiba e740 pocket pc.
2,a good but non exciting book,this is a good but boring book. I would not recomend this book because they just dress up in masks and pretend to do great things.
4,One of the best of Deltora,This bookof theDeltora seriesis very exciting because it is a story about self- finding and is very complicated. The main character is the king of Deltora. His name is Leif and he goes through a lot of difficulties. The book Dragons of Deltora Shadowgate is one book of the series of Deltora and you need to know the whole series to understand the book. I would recommend this book to readers aged 9-12. I think this because it is very confusing and jumps around alot.
5,The 2nd book in the dragons of deltora,"I,(personally), think that this book is clever, clever how the author uses these puzzles, codes, and tricks in it. Any book reader would want this book"
2,"If you liked the singles, avoid this...","Having loved the Dope Smugglaz singles 'Double Double Dutch' and the 'The Word', I bought this as soon as I found it. It wasn't worth it....the only really good track on the album is Double Double Dutch ('the Word' isn't even on there). The rest of the tracks are short (less than a minute) mumbling pieces with no rhythm and little point to them, track 8 is a b-side from the Double Dutch single, or full length tracks with none of the charm of the two singles. Sorry, Dope Smugglaz, but this is a poor show considering what you're capable of... My recommendation would be to get the Double Double Dutch single, and watch the video on it instead, because it's fantastic. This album, however, gets the thumbs down."
5,From Val Middler Middlebrook,"I recommend Destiny's Godchild with great enthusiasm. Diana Johnson's ability to blend history and fiction, giving the characters personalities that captivate your emotions, adds intrigue to what could otherwise be just another history book. Diana Johnson's ingenious talent reaches into the hearts and minds of the people who played such an important role in the freedom we enjoy today. Her only fictional character, Egar, will amuse and captivate you as he moves through the pages so wisely. I could hardly wait to read the sequel. Both books still linger in my mind. Val Middler Middlebrook, author of ""Val's Victory: Defeat was NEVER an Option."""
5,Egar the sorcerer is a winner.,Diana Johnson's passion for medieval French history shines through on every page of Destiny's Godchild. Her meticulous research makes this a fresh and inventive story for readers not only of history but of fiction.
2,COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER,"""Spike Lee's attempt to ""do the WHITE thing""turned into little more than a porno with no plot, an uninterestingstoryline, no conclusive ending, and a talking dog. The real Son of Sam claimed a dog made him do it, but in reality he was probably just some nut who got his sick thrills out of killing. Since there was no proof, why add the dog? The film portrayed Americans with Italian heritage with Hollywood stereotype. A film idea about New York City in the midst of a heat wave, a blackout and riots, and everyone gripped in the paranoia and fear of a stalking serial killer sounded very intriguing. Too bad Lee couldn't do better with that idea. I don't speak for all of Lee's films. I thought Boyz n the Hood was a good movie, though its prejudices are still very one sided. I've been meaning to see Do the Right Thing, which I hear is an outstanding movie."
1,Spike did not do the right thing,This film was so bad that the scenes in the ltalian restaurant didn't even make me hungry
3,Boiling Hot 'Summer',"""The Son of Sam"" was a disturbed. But, ""The Summer of Sam"" has nothing to do with that perturbed individual. It was about people in the Bronx during the summer of 1977, getting down to the rough dirties. I was appalled with the amount of graphic depiction of rough dirties performed everywhere imagined. There were many unnecessary moments in this movie, but only Reggie Jackson was the true hero. Spike Lee directed this character study during a time of paranoia and fear. This movie is not for children and if they watch this movie, they will have nightmares, so parents beware!"
4,Amazon Seller DVD Review,"I received all that was promised. The only problem is that the DVD came from Europe and is set to view on DVD players that are Region #2. In the USA, DVD players will most often only play DVD's set to Region #1 therefpre I can't view it on my DVD player/home theater but have to view it on my computer instead."
3,summer of sam,It was an ok movie. Had been awhile since I have seen it. Not as good as i remember it but ok nonetheless. The best thing that I liked about this movies was the music. When i watched this movie years ago i went out and bought the soundtrack. If ur a fan of old-school 70's disco music pick up the soundtrack. I promise that you will enjoy. As far as the movie its give or take. Has a few good scenes but its not my favorite Spike Lee movie but a good effort.
4,Not Even Close,"The Summer of Sam has its good and bad points.Although the feature film was to depict a serial killer gone made in New York City during the summer of 1977, the film focused on a tight knit group of people reacting to the possibility of unfortunately becoming the next victim.I thought the acting was impeccable. However, John Leguizamo still appeared to be more hispanic than Italian which took away from Vinny and Dionna's relationship. Unlike other Spike Lee features, Mira, John and the other cast members did a superb job.At times it seemed as though there were two movies spliced into one to create what was dubbed the Summer of Sam."
2,Snore,"While it sounds like a really good idea, Summer of Sam turns out to be a boring and overly vulgar film.There are a few interesting scenes but overall the film is badly edited and really fouces far too much on the main characters sex life.None of the characters are particularly well developed and the movie fails to be deep or entertaining. Most people will watch this film becuase it is ""a Spike Lee joint"" but it's not worth the time or money."
1,"Awful movie, but Sorvino was great!","The only thing that comes remotely near saving this movie is Mira Sorvino's performance as the wife of a manipulative, sex-crazed, abusive man.This movie is ALLEGEDLY about Berkowitz, but it sure gets messed up in that effort. The story drags, the sex scenes are horribly irrelevant and disturbingly abusive and graphic, and a lot of the ""plot"" has nothing to do with serial killers - but messed-up, drug-addicted small-time criminals.Mira Sorvino was great, but I hope she's in better movies in the future. this sad excuse for a movie is a uncreative, uninspiring, repulsive mess and I hope never to see anything this horrible again."
3,Spike Lee is not at his best,"Roger Ebert liked it and gave it 3 1/5 stars. I thought it was boring. Positive side: very stylish, great soundtrack. Negative side: I watched it carefully but can only GUESS what it is (exactly) about.Highly recommended for Spike Lee's fans, not recommended for people looking for a very entertaining movie."
2,A somewhat repulsive film,"I found this film a bit repulsive and not really that informative of the 'Son of Sam' murders. I generally really like Spike Lee films but this was not one of his best. If you really want to understand the times and the topic, read ""The Bronx is Burning: 1977, Baseball, Politics and the Battle for the Soul of a City"" by Jonathen Mahler. You can't do better than that."
4,1977..... Oh what a year!,"i loved this movie, but i'm hooked on serial killers. sos was facinating to me, because it looked at average people (yes, average people went to disco's, cbgb's and cheated on their signifigant others in the 70's.. and the 2000's as well) and their lives in relation to the killings rather than focusing solely on the killer. i'm showing my age, but the ""new"" punk movement vs. the disco scene brought back a ton of memories... but then i remember the zodiac as well..... great entertainment"
3,"Entertaining, not Spike's best","This is far from Spike Lee's best. It was an entertaining movie but the simplistic research passing off as 70's style did make it seem a bit weak. An Italian ""guido"" Bronx CBGB punk rocker affecting a British accent who has old Who posters all over his room? And plays air guitar to Babo O'Riley on his new '77 Fender Strat? And he's also a gay stripper and porno star? The vigilante characters are just as unbelievable; as well as the token ""mob"" element.If you watch this with the thought in your head that this is some alternate universe and not trying to portray 70's NYC then you will be fine."
3,NOT A HISTORY LESSON,"If you understand that this movie is not a historical account of the Son of Sam murders, but an insight of all the different happenings that occured during the summer of 77' in NYC, including the paranioa that Sam created you might enjoy this movie."
1,A great example of how bad movies can get,"Spike Lee has done little to impress me since his debut with ""Do The Right Thing"" which I found to be a wonderful film. Lee has a great topic to work with in this film but it is executed in a way that made me sick to my stomach. For one thing only a small portion of this film seemed original. Elements from ""GoodFellas"", ""Boogie Nights"", ""Shampoo"", ""Saturday Night Fever"" and even ""Do The Right Thing"" are all woven together with a serial killer chasing everyone. The language is extemely foul, the sex scenes are borderline porno, the violence is extreme and, the acting is horrible. It all turns out to be a major dissapointment. Some scenes are shot fairly well and the period music was also chosen wisely. Sadly there is not any other credit I can give this film. Watch the movies that were ripped off by this one instead."
1,Buy any other Spike Lee movie but this one!,"I did not enjoy this film. While the acting was fairly good (except for Spike Lee's cameo as a TV reporter-awful), the plot was weak and included too many extraneous tangents. A lot of unnecessary and exploitive sex and moments that were intended to be bizarre and imaginative but just ended up being laughable. Did I mention no rising action and murders set to cheesy 70's music?"
3,Mixes graphic violence and graphic sex,"The point of this movie seems to be that everyone in the 70s was as loathesome as David Berkowitz in their own way. This film graphically depicts sex intermixed with violence. Acting is pretty good, though, I suppose. Leguizamo's character's disloyalty to everyone he knows is despicable. Was this a real person? I don't know, but I'm glad I don't know him if he's like in this movie. One thing a little different about the movie, is that a minor character, the punkrocker friend's step-dad, who is a responsible gun owner is portrayed in a good light."
2,Spike's stab at a Scorcese movie.,"Hard to watch film about Italian losers during the summer of 77... you know you're in trouble when the only remotely likeable character is a punk porno dancer/actor. Leguizamo seems lost as the lead, a scumbag who sleeps around on his wife, Mira Sorvino, who wrestles with her role in front of your eyes. I'll give him an extra star for getting the feel of the 70's right, but this effort is nowhere near as good as his earlier great Clockers."
2,Oh My Gosh!,"I watched this movie finally, it has been rented out for months! I finally got it sat down and watched it, and oh my! What the heck? Every sentence had the ""F"" word in it at leats 5 times! It was part porno! This wasn't horror, suspense it was stupid but had occasinoly good parts."
3,A Sub-standard Spike Lee Joint,"Given this was a Spike Lee Joint, my expectations were higher for this movie. This is definitely not one of Spike's better films but in SOS, Spike strays from his usual racial discourse to a portrayal of the universal dualities of human nature and the ""shadows"" of the human psyche. This theme is highly intriguing and well worth exploring, however Spike's plot gets lost in a barrage of vulgarity, graphic sex, violence and splatter. SOS is a musical and visual montage of the period and realistically captures the fear, hysteria and paranoia of the time. The cinematography, at least, is well within expectation.Michael Badalucco (Jimmy from ABC's ""The Practice"") is eerily humorous as the innerly tormented David Berkowitz however this film is not about the 44 caliber killer but rather the impact of the 1977 murders on individuals, a community and society at large."
2,Nothing to Prove,"Spike Lee has nothing to prove to me. So many of his films--Do the Right Thing, Jungle Fever, Malcolm X, Get On the Bus, and 4 Little Girls--have touched my heart and soul and changed my way of thinking that I can excuse him for one muddled, uneven mediocrity."
3,It went a little TOO over-the-top.,"I really like gritty movies, but this movie just became grimy and digusting after a while. The thing w/ Adrian Brody working in some kind of bizarre gay strip club/S&M club was jut bizarre and sort of unnecissary. Good performances all around. Except for the other tough friends over did the being tough NEW YORKA thing. 1 being a New Yorker I don't talk that way and neither does anyone. It was shot better than any other one of Spike Lee's joints and I WORSHIP the montage w/ Baba O' Reilley, it's my favorite song and it shot really well and very very cool stuff. The movie just made me feel dirty. God love Ben Gazzara!"
3,"Good, But Not Great!","This movie had it's moments. For one thing the nice amount of music that they had in it and some of the gory shootings that this so called "".44 Calibur Killer"" did to nearly every brunnette girl in NYC in 1968-1977. It also has it's disturbing moments like the violent outbursts that the killer gets just when he hears his neighbours dog barking. This movie to me is Rated R because of the EXTREME amount of coarse language and Violence. Also going on to my next topic ""SEX"" I know that a lot of grown men like to watch this kinda stuff just for the sex but this movie had it's fair amounts of sex in it. If I was a parent I would never ever let a child under the age of 15 watch this movie it is just a really disturbing movie but also the storyline was a masterpiece. I am not really a Spike Lee fan but this movie I would have to say is one of his best."
2,"It should have been called ""Summer of Sleep""","This movie is alright. It is way too long. A two and a half hour movie could have been made in under and hour and a half. The only good thing about this movie is the acting by both John Leguizamo and Adrien Brody, thankfully the stars of the film. Spike Lee makes a somewhat hilarious cameo as a news reporter. But other than a rockin' soundtrack and and a half naked, super hot Adrien Brody, this isn't worth a second viewing."
2,John Leguizamo's overrated nudity and butt,I dont understand why people rated this as a good movie. I found it to be very boring. The pointless nudity and nudity. How many times did we need to see John Leguizamo's butt. If you want to see a better Spike Lee Joint see Crooklyn.
1,Bigotry is alive and well in Tinsletown,"Lets be honest.Spike Lee is a bigot who hates white people.When i had to endure this Italian exploitation mess,I felt insulted and as an Italian,quite angry.Hey Spike get a grip.Perhaps your own people are beginning to see through your ways!"
2,wow in a bad way...,"When I went to the movies, I thought Summer Of Sam would be completly different then from what I saw.. I was completly shocked, in a bad way. I went with a few girl friends of mine and a few guy friends of mine.. And definately the guys enjoyed more then the girls did.. I couldn't believe some of the scenes.. all of us girls were like ""we paid to see this? "" and the guys just LOVED it lol I really expected a better storyline.. I know it was a true story, but Spike Lee could of really choose a better point of view of showing the summer of sam murders.. But, some scenes were amazing to watch, because the direction was good.. like when Mira Sorvino and John Lequizamo were in the club dancing.. the lights and choreography was good.. but definately a lot of scenes were not entertaining AT ALL.. lol But there has been mixed reviews about this movie- so rent it if you like. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. I definately did not."
1,Nothing wonderful,If Adrien Brody hadn't been in his underwear. I wouldn't had watched it. The movie really was bad.
3,summer of surprise,"I think the movie was great. It kept my interest and, it touched on everything happening in the times , back then. I know being a kid myself back then , that is how I remember the times. It was a good , good movie. It did just focus on the killer. It focused on a small comunity in New York City. It was real! The sound track was killer,too!"
2,ONLY GOOD THING WAS THE SOUNDTRACK,"I agree with the other reviewer who gave 1 star, the sex scenes were uncalled for, and way to excessive! And boy did this movie DRAG! I usually enjoy Spike Lee films(Girl 6 is one of my TOP 10 fave's), but this was not a winner. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was the soundtrack was REALLY REALLY good! and Mira Sorvino is one of my faves!"
1,Abysmal!!!,"What an awful film. I saw this in a theatre and will never forget when, in what supposed to be a moment of terror and psychosis, David Berkowitz begins to hear a dog speak to him. The audience howled with laughter! I wanted to walk out, but my friend didn't and he had the car keys. Avoid this unless you crave a really violent episode of ""Welcome Back, Kotter!"""
2,"lotsa good, but more bad than good","Summer of Sam is another frustrating film from Spike Lee. Lots of great scenes, ideas, performances, but so many bad, dumb decisions too. The plot itself is Saturday Night Fever meets Shampoo meets the Ox-Bow Incident -- but it's really about Spike making a movie about white Italian scallions who live deep deep deep inside their NY state of mind and can't get out of it. From scene to scene I found myself alternating between ""wow! Spike's got talent to burn"" and ""this feels like it was written by a 10-year-old."" The previous basketball one was the same way. My favorite bit is where the dog talks to the guy and my favorite Spike Lee joint by far remains Get On the Bus!"
2,A Spike Lee Flop,"After about twenty minutes I had to remind myself that this was supposedly about the Son of Sam. Sounded like a good premise but instead we follow John Leguizamo through a boring plot where he thinks he'll go to hell for cheating on his wife. The there was all this time devoted to an Italian guy who thought he was a punk rocker. This movie was all over the place. The subplots were fuzzy and were a distraction since the audience belives the Son of Sam is the main idea here. Egomaniac Spike Lee puts himself in the movie as a reporter. Do the right thing, Spike, and make a good movie next time."
2,Eating its own swelled head,"I don't know much about the real ""Summer of Sam""--I was only a year old. I DO, however, know that this film displays poor excuses for tension and meaning all by itself. The sections of the movie that focus on David Berkowitz are actually the good ones. It's the surrounding drama of the couples and their neighborhoods that really bombs. Director Spike Lee seems to be trying to shock the viewers into some sort of social awakening, but only manages to shock us into realizing what a bigoted movie this is. We are made to dislike EVERYone in the movie (even the characters we're probably supposed to sympathize with), and even that brilliant 'Who' song gets extremely annoying when it's played ten times in one movie. The only thing that kept me from giving ""Summer Of Sam"" one star was the fact that it did provide a bit of historical knowledge into that summer--something I found at least interesting."
1,"One of the WORST,most worthless films ever made","A hateful, unwatchable abortion of a movie--Who green-lighted this piece of trash and WHY? Awful story, script, direction, characters--I think this was the only time I was actually made ILL by how awful a film was--I would have walked out, but I was in the company of other ""victims"" at the theatre and didn't feel like HITCHIKING, or I would have! Spike Lee owes the patrons of this miserable waste of filmstock a refund (and punitive damages) A disgrace to Hollywood and even the decade of the 70's--one thing worse than sitting through this film would have been getting shot by David Berkowitz--S-U-C-K-S! Spikey went on to make other horrible films like BAMBOOZLED. Someone take his movie camera away!!"
4,Weird film from Director Spike Lee.,"This film have an excellent cast inculding John Leguizamo, Mira Sorvino, Andien Brody, Jennifer Esposito she really good in this film and i didn`t recognize the actress Bebe Neuwirth.Director Spike Lee has good cast to make this film works at times, especially uneven at times, including the film ending. This film is the most underrated films of 1999. Director Spike Lee give himself always a small role in every film, he direct it.This film own more to Director of Taxi Driver andCasino. Is the first film from Spike Lee doesn`t cast the lead to a black actor."
2,Not as good as expected.,"This wasn't one of the best films that I've seen lately. The thing about it that I didn't particularly care for was that it was too long (it should have wrapped up a lot sooner than it did). The acting was okay, but none of the cast stood out. Summer of Sam wasn't as good as I thought it would have been. It's a real gritty and coarse movie in all aspects, but didn't capture my attention completely. I actually give this film 2.5 stars."
3,Not all that,"I thought this was going to be a good movie. But it wasn't all what it was cracked up to be. I thought it was going to depict information about David Berkowitz going on a killing spree, but this movie had little to do with that. The movie focused more on the disco scene, the sexual revolution associated with the disco scene, and the punk movement in the 70's than with The sun of sam. This movie wasn't Spike Lee's best film. The movie would of did better just focusing on The late 70's Disco Scene such as Boogie Nights did. But then again the title didn't say Son of Sam, it said Summer of Sam so what was I supposed to expect? Nevertheless, I wasn't impressed with the movie. Even though the film wasn't that good this was the best acting Leguizamo has ever done, he's usually a cheesy and stupid actor."
1,this actually made it to the theaters?,"Having been a teenager in the 70's, I was excited about the prospects for this movie. The film disappoints on all fronts, however. Instead of a period piece, or cultural revelation of that time period, we are served a poorly acted, ""in your face"", directionless movie in search of itself. While the son of sam seems artfully and accurately portrayed as the sub plot, it gets completely out of hand. If you don't find yourself asking 'why am I watching this?' when you get to the scene with the talking dog, then you and I will disagree and part ways here, but for the rest of you, skip this one."
1,"If you like soft porn and vulgar language,this film's 4U","This is absolutely the worst movie I've rented all year and I am sooo glad I didn't pay money to see it in the theatre. Almost every dialogue in the movie centered around the 'f' word, the sex scenes were vulgar, bordering on porn, and it dragged on for a painful 140 minutes. The idea behind the film (a NYC Italian-American neighborhood during the heat-wave, black-out summer of Sam) was a good starting point, but this movie needed direction, better writers, more developed characters (rather than so many characters) and less vulgarity. Somebody help Spike Lee make a good, meaningful movie--he's on a long losing streak!"
1,What a Piece of Junk,"It seems that the other reviewers are afraid to ""dis"" the great Spike Lee. This was the most boring movie I've seen in a long, long time. The gratuitous sex scenes bordered on porno. And how about that great acting by Spike? What a piece of garbage. It gets one star only because zero was not an option."
5,Port A Park,"Easy assembly, sturdy and solid for 14 year olds. Best part was free shipping when all others wanted $150+"
3,review,"zalman thermal grease was cooling my cpu pentium M780 2.26Ghz only two weeks. After 2 weeks, cpu gets high and became useless. I tried arctic silver 5 and got same results. Now I'm using arctic MX-14. It's way better than zalman or silver 5. RECOMMEND MX-14 but no zalman nor arctic silver 5."
2,Meh.,I liked the idea of brush on grease. The bottle I received was new and half dried out. I'm not sure how well it would hold up over time. I'm going back to Arctic Silver. The only good part is that it was easy to clean off.
1,Zalman ZM-STG1 Super Thermal Grease - Nothing Super about this,Zalman ZM-STG1 Super Thermal Grease - Nothing Super about this product. I have a laptop that would automatically shut down due to an overheated cpu. I tried Zalman ZM-STG1 Super Thermal Grease only to have the exact same results of automatic shutdown. I tried this product a few times with slightly different applications and the results were the same. It does not do the job as intended. Save your aggravation and money and use OCZ. I did not experience any more automatic shutdowns with OCZ Freeze Thermal Compound.
5,Good choice,It's _very_ easy to use and it works just fine. My system is overclocked by 20% and it's stable. For me this means that this grease does its job well.
5,THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!,This movie ROCKS! I got it after seeing an ad on TV and I love it. It has a great cast and off the wall cult comedy. This movie is not for the timid or mainstream people. You can go to the official web site and check out the trailer... it's a good example of what the movie is like.
1,I HATE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE,"THIS WAS NOT A MOVIE, WHEN I SAW THE COMMERICALS FOR THIS MOVIE ON TV THEY ADVERTISTED IT ON BEING ONE OF THE MOST OFFISEIVE MOVIES YOU'LL EVER SEE. I WAS NO OFFENED ONE BIT. THIS ""MOVIE"" WAS SO BAD, I SERIOUSLY BROKE THE DVD DISC AFTER WATCHING IT, IM NOT JOKING. PLUS WHEN I BOUGHT IT OFF THERE 1800 # THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME ANOTHER TAPE OF BONUS FOOTAGE WHICH WAS NEVER SENT TO ME. I PURCHASED THE DVD AND AFTER WATCHING IT I WAS SO DISSAPOINTED, I LATER FOUND OUT AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE THAT IT USE TO BE A PUBLIC ACCESS SHOW IN CALIFORNIA. I DONT MIND PUBLIC ACCESS SOMETIMES I LIKE IT, BUT IM SORRY BUT I HATED THIS AND EVEN THE FEW STARS IN THIS MOVIE DIDN'T MAKE UP FOR THE FACT OF HOW BAD IT WAS. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH THAT PLEASE DONT BUY THIS!!!!!!"
1,possibly the most derivitive film ever,"The writer/director of this film should slit his wrists, it is the worst comedy that I've ever seen in my entire life and verging on the worst movie ever.... and I'm including pulp horror and all manner of trash like that. Not only is it utterly idiotic... it's just plain boring, which is the worst crime that a movie can commit. It's not even offensive as the film so boldly claims that it is, just dumb, half retarded, possibly with a hint of downsyndrome."
5,OH MY GOD!,"This is definitely the craziest funniest movie ever. It's like Jackass, Scary Movie and Kentucky Fried Movie rolled up into one. There's a superhero called Dickman who fights the lesbian community and the ""Watt's Up"" talk show is historical. I have to recommend this movie however the movie is not for everybody and is very offensive if you can't laugh at the jokes. So if you can laugh at yourself and don't mind the offensive nature, I strongly recommend it. Oh yea, great for parties!"
1,This is the worst movie I have ever seen.,"This is the single worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This is not an exaggeration or hyperbole; really and truly, the worst movie ever."
1,Just NOT funny,"To call this film crap is an INSULT to crap. The producers of this film have the nerve to compare it to the Kentucky Fried Movie. The Kentucky Fried Movie was truly hilarious, this film is just a WASTE of film. If I can encourage anybody not to waste $20.00 then I will be pleased."
1,garbage................,hands down the worst bit of film ever. Anyone who liked this is high on homegrown dirt weed or crazy....................i rather watch reality tv
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This,"This movie is just not funny. It's not shocking, edgy, or offensive. It's just stupid. In the credits, it says something about the producers of ""There's Something About Mary"" ripping this movie off. Nothing in ""There's Something About Mary"" reminded me of this ""movie"" in the slightest. Maybe they stole the funny parts and didn't give them back, and that's why we're left with this unfunny non-movie. I'll admit that my sense of humor is very low-brow, immature, and childish, but I still didn't even laugh once. Not a chuckle. Not even a titter. There is no way that any human being could find this ""movie"" funny or entertaining in any way. Don't be deceived by the one star in my rating. It's not even worth one star, I just didn't have the option of picking anything lower. Don't make the same mistake I made. There's 1.5 hours of my life that I wasted and I'll never have back. Don't let it happen to you."
4,Crazy!!!!,"This movie pushes the envelop to new heights. The only thing I didn't like is the nechrophilia scene - in a bit called ""Porno Review"", but my boyfriend thought it was hysterical. This movie is definitely not for the mainstream but it is liberating to laugh at things you're not supposed to, it bashes almost everybody and because it's so funny you don't mind it."
1,wow.,"i really hate it when people who make money off of something go and review it everywhere and give it the best ratings. one thing i hate more than that is this movie. if you want offensive, go watch southpark. if you want a lot of celebrities, go watch jay and silent bob strike back. if you want stupidity, wtach this. or bill & ted."
1,A WARNING not to buy!,"This movie, without question, is the most disgraceful attempt at comedy I have ever seen. Not once while sitting there watching this piece of trash did i so much as smirk. I love comedy of any sort so long as it is funny. This can not even be classified under the genre of comedy, it should be classified under the genre ""Vince Offer is a joke and this is his movie.""I literally cracked the disk and burned it after watching this.I don't know who the people are that actaully enjoyed this movie but they must be the most feeble-minded idiots on earth who giggle when they hear the word ""boob"". If you're thinking of buying this movie, consider wiping your ass with a $20 bill instead to make it more useful. I can't even believe i have to give this film one star."
1,"Repulsive, Vile, and Not Funny.","Vince Offer directs and stars in this low budget, low class crapfest. I have never seen a worse or less funny movie. Anyone who finds this movie to be even vaguely amusing should be in therapy.Maybe it's just me, but I am highly suspicious about the 'promotional qualities' contained in most of the five star reviews of this film. I find it hard to believe, for instance, that the grammatically challenged ""Dr. Feel"", who claims to be a 'distinguished doctor in the medical field', can't compose a coherent sentence, or at the very least know how to use spell check.Leave this movie alone. I thought it would be 'good in it's badness' like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" or even a Troma release, but it isn't. It is actually quite bad in its badness and is simply unbearable. It does not even deserve one star, but that is the lowest allowed by Amazon.Yuck."
1,Duh,"If you saw the ad, you saw the best parts of the movie. A ""Kentucky Fried Movie"" wannabe, that doesn't come close. 30 minutes in and one semi-laugh. Save your time."
5,A-Zoom Snap Caps,"This product is excellent even though I did not purchase from Amazon. There is five in a pack and compared to live ammunition, these snap caps come pretty close in measurements. They are not flimsy and cheap and the color of it makes it easy to separate from live ammo. They fit perfectly and cycle through my springfield xd 9mm without any hiccups. It also gives you a feel of the trigger break. Works well building muscle memory and I have definitely seen improvements in my pistol shooting accuracy! Great for practicing and they hold up well."
5,Great for training!,Video review available. See my full product review on youtube with in depth product usage... Search for my channel: INTOWEAPONS
1,A-Zoom Snap Caps,"I bought a package of 9mm snap caps and they arrived today. The package contained 5 ""precision"" units. I tried them in 3 separate 9mm guns and only 3 of the 5 units would chamber properly and it was always the same 2 that would not chamber. It appears that only 60% of the units are ""precision""."
1,Didn't like it,It gets beat up really fast and leaves tiny colored flakes in the gun when I cycle it through the action. I just manually drop one in the chamber when dry firing so I don't have to rack the slide. Just not a durable product at all.
3,A-Zomm 9mm,"They work great for dry firing and that's about it. The ones I got are not machined well and have a serious lip or edged where the ""bullett"" meets the casing. Due to this I cannot load up the mag and cycle them through the gun without jamming up. What a pita. Next time I will buy from a store so I can inspect them first."
5,Great,"Bought these before I bought my new pistol. They work great, the metal body on them feels much more durable than some of the other brands plastic ones. I have cycled these probably 50-100 times each and they do show signs of wear but they still work great and keep the gun damage free and safe."
1,"Wish there was a ""0 star"" available","Aluminum breaks apart when cycling in the gun.The soft plastic ""primer"" is worthless after only a few dry fires.At the best, these are only good for teaching people how to load a magazine. I would not recommend cycling these or using them for dry fire.Google ""snap caps best and worst"" for YouTube video. It accurately reviews these."
3,Training needs met,This product serves what I need as far as triger pull and pulling from my holster. Its just for training needs.
3,It's Ok,"I use these for dry firing and simulating failure to fire (FTF). It works, but can sometimes jam when attempting to cycle a round. So not totally to 9mm Luger spec, but works for intended purpose."
4,Useing them to function check and dry-fire a Glock,"Per recommendation online, I bought these to dry fire a Glock 34 Gen 4. They do and fit exactly like they should.The only thing is when I was racking the side to function check, one somehow got jammed in the ejection port. This didn't damage the firearm but there was a burr in the snap-cap. So, I threw it away -- I didn't want to damage a $700 gun to salvage a single snap cap. I never had one get caught in the ejection port again and now I don't even rack the slide all the way; just enough to reset the trigger.I'll probably buy more soon just to have a few more to stretch out the magazines. (I don't keep live ammo in my home for safety)."
1,not that great,I tried this product in a Ruger SR9c. It seems that they are great at practicing misfeeds since that is what they do pretty much all the time.I am now looking for something else.
4,Excellent Snap Caps,"These were great snap caps. Allows me to practice drawing from my holster as well as dry firing and loading, unloading. With Semi-Auto's being so popular it should come with 10 or 15 but they were probably made when revolvers were more standard. I'd HIGHLY recommend these. If you mistake these for live rounds you need to put down the gun and get your eyes checked LOLHope you enjoy them and practice often as in an emergency situation it's important to make sure you know what to do and are able to do it almost on automatic pilotsteve @ www.doomsday-preppers.com"
5,Good Quality,"I recently bought a CZ DA/SA pistol and wanted to dry-fire it to work out the trigger some and get it a little smoother. Most manufacturers advice against extensive dry-firing so I looked into these snap caps. The best thing about them is that they are made of metal. I cycled all 5 of them repeatedly through my SP-01 and the extractor didn't leave so much as a mark on them. The rubber ""primer"" on them is sturdy and appears to be well-made. I have only fired it about 50 times with one of these but it's in tact and looks great.For the money, these are the snap caps to go with. They're well-made and will hold up to a little abuse. I'm planning on using them up and when they're done and the rubber primers are shot (pardon the pun), I'll get more. Great addition to any range bag. They're great for training on trigger control as well as teaching new shooters how to load magazines and cycle rounds manually when a light strike or jam occurs without having to use live rounds."
5,Great Dryfire Product,Makes practice very easy to do anywhere. This allows you to hone your trigger control and is great for any type of handgun.
2,Don't fit very well.,They aren't normal 9mm round size and if you eject the magazine while the cap is in it will fall out..
1,poor quality,"these do not load well at all. they bind up and the slide gets stuck. they arent accurately sized, they seem too big in diameter."
1,Color,Whoever figured out the color for these snap caps never tried to find them once they were ejected. Neon would be a much better choice.
1,jams pistol,"they come in a pack of 5 but only 2 of the 5 eject from my 9mm the other 3 jam up and do not eject, I will not buy from this company again. P.S. this is the first time I have rated on Amazon I do not put down products unless they do not work."
2,awful,"bought this elsewhere and not even 25 fires to one, and almost tears apart. the area where the firing pin hits is almost pushed inside.Piece of gargabe product!"
2,They JAM all the time!,"Not sure why, but these caps seem to jam about 50% of the time when trying to expel the round from the chamber. Otherwise, everything else was great. Fast shipping, good service, etc."
4,Good for Practice,"Have used these snap caps before. They work well - feed and eject like the real thing. They do get a bit scuffed up from the magazine feed lips over time, but still function as intended. Would recommend to anyone for practice handling firearms."
4,practicle,"i really like this product in my tuarur 24/7. manufacturer recommends not dry-firing, due to potential damage to firing pin. this product prevents this damage and i can safely practice dry fire, simply raking the rail provides new casing.it is a sa/da pistol so reloading is for practice only."
5,Practice practice practice.,Practice makes perfect. These are well made and cycle thru just fine. Not sure what to do with them when they are not in use. Wish they would provide a little storage case for them when not it use.
1,The worst Peter and the Wolf EVER!,"Buckley sounds like he'd rather be cleaing toilets than reading the script to Peter and the Wolf. I know this is an out of print recording from a defunct recored label, but since it is still listed out here, I thought I'd warn anybody tempted by it, as was I. It is completely, thoroughly dreadful in every way."
3,Good For Keeps,"It was really nice to see all the present Kings how they were when they were not Kings... they were funny and will always be funny, This DVD i will rate it as a THREE STARRegardsSalome Ferrao"
4,Excellent reference book for those needing to know more about the trombone.,"Very thorough text. This is not another exercise book. Instead it is more of a reference source including all of the technical data one might need to solve problems or answer questions. There are a few basic exercises here, but mostly it is very dry reading. Very much to the point. I found it very helpful as all the books in this series tend to be."
2,disapionted,"the book is a little too intence,academical and advance for the beginner.demonstrations and simplification for the beginner is much needed,as a result it boring for the beginner."
2,Septic System Soil Probe,"Bought this soil probe to locate the distribution boxes in my septic field. The probe is fiberglass which is great for strength, but it flexes too much as you are attempting to push it into the ground. Only works well if the ground is fairly moist. Not for professional use or frequent use in any kind of soil conditions. Instead, you will probably want a metal probe."
5,termagaunts,tyrinad termagaunts are awesome! i play warhammer 40k and these little baddies are really good. this set is good for beginers because it is easy to asemble.i recomend 1 of these sets to start and if you like it get the bigger termagaunt brood. enjoy!
3,"Good, but needs an update.","This book was actually written after the 3025 technical readout. It was published for all the fans who wanted to see some of the ""Lostech"" from the Star League mentioned so often in the TR3025. It's one of the few technical readouts that hasn't been updated and it shows. Some of the technology it mentions in passing is more likely to be found in Star Trek, while many of the events mentioned contradict the updated, official story line. Its worth owning and reading, but FanPro really needs to reprint it after bringing it up to speed!"
2,This book was disappointing compared to the 3025 readout,"The 2750 readout gave us a number of new vehicles, aerospace fighters, warships and personal equipment to use, but what we really wanted was MECHS!!! This readout gave us a tiny 20 new designs. I was disappointed with the brief descriptions given, the non-existance of varients and the poor choices of design. They should have included some info on Star League spec. 3025 mechs too. The art work was okay and the layout was familiar."
2,nah,cd isnt that good there are better tunnel trance force cds out there than vol 25. like vol 24 and 26 and 18
2,Ehhh....very slow treatise on sociology,"First things first...this really was not a romance. I would more call this a psychological, sociological and religious ficticious exploration. There was not much romance stuff going on...and trust me I know romance. There was no real villan and the ending kinda just crept up on you.....very slowww. Half way through the book I was at the point of yelling ""get to it already"". It was all pretty much a big blur to me so if you want romance read Sherrilyn Kenyon or Gena Showalter since there was nothing much going on here. Interesting fantasy concept...pretty darn nothing romance."
2,The Saint,"I was very dissappointed in this book. All of the other Wildside books have been very intresting and edge of your seat, dont want to put them down. This book is simply a soapbox for the writers ideals on life and the state of our planet. Thats fine and her absolute right to write this kind of book, however, I found myself skipping whole passages because she went on and on and on constantly and I got very tired of this. This book is less a Wildside romance and more a political statement."
2,Not a romance at all...,"This book appears in the romance aisle and has the typical romance cover, but it really doesn't qualify as a romance, since very little actual plot or story time overall is used to deal with the attraction between the leads. It is, in reality, a melange of things: a social treatise, a psychological profile of the main characters (both of whom have Serious Issues), a retelling of historical beliefs and myths. Without the interesting writing style of the author, this book would be a complete mess; as it is, it ends up being odd, but interesting. If you are looking for romance, look elsewhere. If you want to spend a few hours contemplating the nature and purpose of religion, the difficulties of transcending differences in culture (and the resulting cruelty, advertent and inadvertent), and the commercialization of Christmas while occasionally delighting in an interesting turn of phrase, this is the book for you."
1,Worst book ever!,"Ok, I'm quite mellow about romance novels but I have to say this book was horrible and painfully disapointing. It was like every Mary Sue cliche possible as used all at once. The characters were flat and one dimensional, the plot..was there a plot I couldn't tell? And the characters were unlikeable. The character of Kris was the most farfetched overly gary stu male lead I have EVER read and I had to force myself to finish this bit of mindless drivel.I'm glad I got this on mega sale and the only use it's had so far is going to be something to prop my good books up with. This is aweful and it shocks me to see how far such a previously good author has fallen. Don't waste the money on this, even if you can get it for 1 cent. It's not worth the paper it's printed on."
1,Book Review,"The title of this book is deceptive in that once you read the inside cover, you discover that it wsa for Americans in the 1980's and that, in many ways, times have changed significantly. If you know nothing about the Japanese culture or people, this book is a decent start. But if you really want to know about protocol and today's Japanese, you will have to look elsewhere."
4,A Qurky Delight of a Film,"What can you say about a film involving a young man who will not leave the bathroom?Hilarious and, at times, poignant seems to sum it up.Excellent cast with Stephen Root as the beleagured dad who just wants to get through each day and Justin Long as the son who just wants to be left alone. Dysfunctional family - you bet - but one that keeps you interested.It would appear as if Long has watched Office Space more than once in order to adapt Root's character from that film, into his own version of Milton for Raising Genuis.A great film? No, but one that should be in any film lovers library anyway."
4,Raising Genius,This is really funny and good for family viewing. Only one scene deserves parental guidance for young viewers. The cast is ideal I think. Danica McKellar does not do much but is very effective doing her part. The plot is simple but very good.
1,Doesn't live up to the specs on the box,"Gigabit? The speeds are about 5-6 megabytes per second. Does that sound like Gigabit?Since it is a file server you would expect to be able to have multiple shares right? wrong. Only one at any one time.Mac compatible? Hardly. It's more like the Mac can connect, but it doesn't have Appleshares or Appletalk/IP.The UI is really bad. I updated to 1.02 of the firmware, but that didn't help any of these problems. Other than that it was great."
1,Unfortunately I have bought a DLINK product again...,"I can only blame myself. After having a lot of problems with the DSM-320; I still managed to be dumb enough to purchase a DSM-g600 rev. A. (even worse than rev. B)It frequently disconnects from my computer (every 10 min)and freezes. I have to pull the power cord to get it running again...I was promised ftp server functionality, rev.a has not got it!This is the second time DLINK has stolen my money by selling me junk. Do not make the same misstake as me! Do not even consider to purchase a DLINK product!If they ever manage to fix the issues with the DSM-g600 rev. a, I promise I will update this review. Until then, keeo clear!!!"
2,"Poor Tech Support, Poor UPnP-AV Execution","This single device could potentially have everything I want.... if it all worked. (Rev B).The specs are great which is what made me buy it, but like most D-Link hardware, it's very poorly executed and rushed to market. Major issues are:1) Occasional 'freezing' and random disconnects for several moments while browsing folders2) No option to automatically boot back up after a power failure3) UPnP-AV does not sort alphabetically. This makes playing an entire folder in alphabetical (or chronological) order impossible.4) Tech support seems focused on turning around emails (albeit slowly), and not doing any actual tech support.5) EXTREMELY noisy fan... and I mean ridiculously noisy!6) No option to edit email server port number for email alerts7) Overall poor quality, should have had a lot more testing before being released to the public.Not bad for the price, but if you don't need all of these features in one device, look elsewhere."
1,"Poor product, poor service.","Purchased DSM-G600 (B1); upgraded firmware to 1.02. Very difficult to configure and setup. Will not recognize any drive over 250 GB. This is not documented anywhere except in an obscure FAQ page on the D-Link web page. Tech support is not worth the time. I was disconnected multiple times. I knew more about the product from reading online documentation then tech support did. Returned for a refund. Save your money, save your time. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
1,Very Slow,I was unable to get better than 10 MB/Sec on this device (a newer Rev B1) with the latest 1.02 firmware despite full gigabit Ethernet connectivity.The little fan on this thing is LOUD too.
3,Works OK,Works OK. I have ver B with firmware updates (last update was 2 or 3 years ago - if they keep selling this they really need to support it better.) Wish it would hibernate so it did not run all of the time. I mainly bought it for its UPnP Media Server but can't get it to work with my SMC Media Receiver. Not sure if the problem is the d-Link or the SMC. I tried e-mailing customer service but they replied stating I needed to call. I have not bothered yet as calling is usually frustrating. Good use for old PATA drive. Only pay the extra money if you need the wireless as they're a much cheaper and faster enclosures out there. It does allow you to attach two external drives via USB but only writes on FA32 or Linux formatted hard drives. Could be better. Got a good price so not so bad but don't spend more than $60-$70 for this. It is being sold for twice that amount. Shop around.
1,Too Hot to Handle!,"Although the sound quality and features of this techniques receiver were very good, its venilation system is extremely poor and it gets very hot. If you have your components in a cabinet, you will not be able to leave this receiver on for very long. I had to return it because I thought the wood shelf above the receiver in my cabinet was going to catch on fire or warp. I had to return the product."
3,Book is ok did not lke the format,This book is ok however I did not like the way it is set up. Does not flow every well. would not read a second time or recommend buying it. Find in a library.
3,ok but small,"The quality is fine. The shorts are small in width and length. My son is 5'8"" without a stitch of fat. He wears a 31' waist. These shorts are snug at the waist and above the knees. He wore them right away so I couldn't try to return them. I also figured they weren't uncomfortable."
1,AN AUDIO RAPING FOR THE MASSES,"I first heard this cd when my wife wasted my hard earned money on it. Needless to say her allowance is now in permanent moritoriam. The assault on my ears by this pompous, self indulgent windbag was enough to send me to the liquor store for a case of Bourbon in hopes to drink it's memory out of me. This cd is perfect if you want to punish the ones you love. I wish I could give it zero stars but I guess when it can be used as a weapon it deserves at least one.A true weapon of mass destruction."
1,terrible,"cheesy album, she is the worst singer i ever came across, and all her music turns people off, she is the worst singer in that last decade and hopefully this is the last i see of her!"
5,All The Way...A Decade of Song,"A great way to leave us, with a record that has all her top hits and some new recorded songs."
2,Nothing but a cash grab,"Once again the music industry must ask why so many users are turning to online P2P services, such as WINMX, Face facts, here is a Celine Dion's Greatest hits, and it does not include all her greatest hits. Instead they leave off songs such as WHERE DOES MY HEART BEAT NOW, and WATER FROM THE MOON, among others, WHY??? Simple, its a CASH GRAB!!! More than likely in a year or two they will release a double CD set with the previously mentioned tunes and more filler, as this CD has. HELLO!!!!!!!!!!! Wake up to reality and put all her greatest hits on 1 cd, and stop the GREED. Too many times you see greatest hits complilations from a group or artist and they have purposely left off great charted tunes, so they can put out yet another CD to make money. Once again trying to soak the consumer for more cash. Time to boycott these record company thieves. No offence too online CD services such as CD now or others, they are great and only deliver what is given to them."
5,"bravo celine, another excellent cd",i very much enjoy listening to ms dion. her songs are amazing. she also seems to be a very nice person. she will be missed but deserves this time off.
5,Another totally spellbinding album from Céline Dion!,"The 9 hits will be familiar to most people already as wonderful music, but the new releases are spectacular - amazing songs with wonderful melodies and powerful moving vocals from Celine! She will defiately be missed during her break!"
2,Titanic talent takes on water,"It's a historic moment: Ol' Blue Eyes and Young Iron Pipes, two hugely popular vocalists, together for the very first time. Guess who triumphs? Okay, so the song ""All the Way,"" Dion's pairing with the late great Frank Sinatra, is only a virtual duet, cooked to perfection in a studio. Still, Sinatra's sophisticated talent only serves to highlight how blunt and overpowering the French-Canadian chanteuse's alto sometimes sounds. An unsatisfying hodgepodge, this disc features nine hits (including her greatest, ""My Heart Will Go On"") plus seven less memorable new tracks that will leave even Dion diehards wanting more than this album offers."
3,Beautiful and Heart Warming Songs,"Celine Dion has an amazing and beautiful voice, and the songs here showcase it wonderfully. Although I feel a few essential songs have escaped the collection, ie. 'All By Myself' and 'Think Twice', the majority of the songs here are great. Highlights include 'The Power Of Love', 'Beauty and The Beast', 'Because You Loved Me', 'That's The Way It Is' and the incredible and beautiful 'To Love You More'. The massive and Grammy-award winning hit 'My Heart Will Go On' is nice as well. The only reason I didn't give this album 4 stars is that I feel some of the songs are fillers, but all in all this album is an essential addition to any record collection."
4,Céline is not only a singer...,"Correction: Céline is not only a very talented singer but also both an excellent pianist and a songwriter; she has composed many songs (released: Don't Save It All For Christmas Day, Ce n'était qu'un rve), but fortunately (or unfortunately) for her, she has been surrounded by some very talented songwriters and has released only a few."
5,Let's stop underestimating the power of Celine.,"Frankly, i have to admit that i have never heard a more beautiful voice than Celine's. I have been reading the bad review's about Celine and i find them rather nauseating myself. It is an honor to own all of Celine's CD's I especially like this CD, All the Way. I love her duet with Frank Sinatra and i know there's no one who can sing a duet better. So what, if some of the songs aren't in this CD go out and buy her other CD that contains your favorite song. Celine is remarkable in singing, personality and always having time for her fans. So tell me what other singer is like that. So sit back an enjoy this CD and stop being so jealous of this talented woman."
5,Celine Shines,"This album is by far my favorite Celine album. Not only are some of her most well known songs on here, but the new additions are just amazing and by far Celine's most wodnerful work recently. She said she could never top LTAL, but she certainly did that with this album. Thank you, Celine. Have a wonderful break and I, along with all your fans, hope to see you back soon."
4,Critic on All the way.... A Decade of Song,"I found this CD to be an excellent one, 'cause it contains marvelous songs of the past decades, that expressed in Celine's voice, certainly takes you back to the essense of life and love.Certainly, we will miss her, and will anxiously wait for her return.Adrián Dixon"
3,nice collection.,"Celine has a great voice, and got the best producers. The Best are songs are 1. Power of Love - good. 4. Because You Loved Me - Great Dianne Warren 7. To Love You More - Nice, different song. 8. My Heart Will Go On - overplayed, but good. 9. I'm Your Angel - nice duet. 10. That's The Way It Is -great up tempo. 11. If Walls Could Talk - Mutt Lange/shania does all the work. 13. All The Way - nice duet. 14. Then You Look At Me -great. 15. I Want You To Need Me - another great Dianne Warren song."
5,GET THIS AND YOU HAVE THE BEST OF ALL CELINE'S MUSIC!,Have all her tapes...and by far this is the very best. You get all of her best music on this one disc. I recommend it very highly for people of all ages. I work in a machine shop and wear a walkman...and this is the one I hear night after night...keeps me going...trust me...you will love it!
3,an okay collection hits,"I just can't believe they only included 9 Greatest hits, and 6 mediocre new songs... Don't get me wrong ""That's The Way It Is"" ""I Want You To Need Me"" ""First Time"" are all great songs, but she could've done without the others. Also the omission of ""Where does My Heart Beat Now?"" has definetly left this album feeling weak.Other hits missing: Nothing Broken But My Heart, Misled, Think Twice, All By Myself, Falling Into You, The Reason, Tell Him, When I Fall In Love.Highlights: That's The Way It Is, The Power Of Love, If You Asked Me To, To Love You More, My Heart Will Go On..."
5,WOW!,"This cd is fantastic. Celine really put her all into this one. The classics are great choices and the new stuff is incredible. My personal favorites of the new stuff: ""If Walls Could Talk"" and ""Live"". Definately pick this one up!"
4,An unbiased and objective review.......,"Ok so you came here to buy a christmas gift. you need some recommendations that are fair and unbiased. You don't want slop from fans but need a real objective view point.Here goes. I'm not a Celine Dion fan. I bought the c.d. to hear what it had to offer. This I wasn't prepared for. Her voice is especially fine tuned on LIVE, which is possibly the best song on here. Her phrasing and intonation is well-defined. Other experimentations are 'I want you to need me'... dont let the title fool you. It's not all slop. I thought i was listening to Aerosmith in their better days. She does have a rock 'n roll voice. Who would have thought. 'Then you look at me' is probably my favorite. epic sounding and triumphant, there are some words in here that gave me chills when she said it, and joys all at once.'beauty and the beast and 'because you loved me probably shouldn't be included. But there are enough highs and new artistry in here to keep you engaged and listening."
1,You've Got to be Kidding,"I think the CIA should use ""All by myself"" as a means to extract information from enemy agents. They would break after about 5 seconds. But that is not the only suicide-inducing ditty on this CD, that would be too easy. Someone should tell Celine that her 15 minutes of fame are up, stop milking it already!"
1,MORE ELEVATER MUSIC FOR THE COMFORTABLY NUMB,"This is not art, but pure elevater/soap opera type of music. I have heard these songs(unfortunatelY) when I was over an colleagues house and it almost put me to sleep. How can anyone listen to such banel trite stuff? Music should have some asthetic value, which this rates as a zero in. It is one of the reasons I don't bother turning on Mtv, VH1, or the radio, because I don't want to end up completely numb like most of our society."
3,Could've Been Better,"Celine delivers another powerful album, but that doesn't mean that this album is great...Some of the new tracks are pretty boring and I'm sowry to admit that it gives me a headache when I listen to tracks like Live and some other boring ones.. And What the hell Beauty and the Beast?i Mean common people Mariah's #1's although not a greatest hits is way better."
1,i wanted to like this but...,"celine dion is apparently repeating her stuffs and she has already shown all of her skills, come on lady treat your audience well!"
1,Won't even spend the money for this...,"Usually I would not come up on this tramp's album board and post a review about her sorry album, because I'm not stupid enough to buy an album from an artist I can't stand. Unlike some of you dumb Celine Dion lovers who go buy Mariah Carey CD's knowing you hate her, then want to come and put negative reviews on Mariah's board. Get a life! One thing I have learned... Celine lovers can't possibly like someone as classy as Mariah, and Mariah lovers can't possibly like someone as trampy and wish-washy as Celine Dion. At least Mariah is true to herself. So let's stop this garbage. Stay off the Mariah album board and keep your sorry reviews to yourself. You're not going to like ANYTHING of hers, so why bother trying? Y'all are dumb enough to spend the money for a Mariah CD when you know you hate her! At least I know how to spend my money, and it certainly will not go for a Celine Dion CD. Oh. And Celine is not better than Mariah."
1,can this salvage her career,"gone all the good old days of celine dion, my heart will go on is her last straw! this album is to celebrate her departure, still her last album she wanna turns everyone off by her corny songs that is always repeating by itself like a music box, she is a truly fad, a titanic fad...goodbye celine, your career, is sinking like the titanic!"
1,Absolutely Nauseating. Celine Dion is Queen of the Harpies,"A decade of song is ten years too long for this unfortunate French Canadian export to the world. If you want to induce sickness, you can play this CD really loud and I guarantee you will be vomiting within minutes."
1,sick of her!,"i am totally sick of her songs, its always the same old sound she is trying to put into everybodies mind, and i am not gonna be so shallow as to be taken in by her... she should try to change her singing tactic and also she should switch comoany...may be this will help!this album is her worst of all!"
1,And They Call This Celine's Greatest Hits?,"Celine Dion did it again...released another boring album! I mean what kind of a greatest hits is this anyways? She probably put the other seven songs because she thinks that she doesn't have enough hits, which by the way is true. And people, especially meeh got tired of listening to her rather good songs but a sorry voice. I actually liked her other cd titled Falling Into You. Which I know better than her Greatest Hits...although being criticized for her slutiness MARIAH CAREY's #1's album is sure way better,although it's not her greatest hits, this album is all the way better than Celine Dion's HITS. And Mariah Carey is the only active rrecording artist to have the ost hits and Mariah is the bes selling female artist...Compare her to Celine Dion? No, I would not compare her to Celine cause you'll know what I'll say for the TRYING-HARD Celine. Go MARIAH! just GO AWAY CELINE...U don't need a greatest hits album to get people's sympathies...MARIAH! MARIAH!"
4,The Hits of Celine,"Justbefore signing out of the limelight for a much-deserved hiatus, Celine offers the public a collection of her greatest hits plus more. What's cool about this album is that it shows a different side of Celine. That she could also render upbeat songs and not just ballads as others would categoriza her. The current single That's the way it is should be released commercially to further boost this wonderful album and so that it will have a long staying power in the charts. Other noteworthy tracks here are ""If Walls COuld Talk"", ""Live"", The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"",""Then You Look At Me"". while his digitally mastered duet with Frank Sinatra may appeal to older audiences, it wont appeal that much to the younger ones... Anyway, yhis is album rates 4 stars. This album is great for a ""greatest hits"" album and more! Thanks Celine for giving us your voice!"
3,nothing new under the sun,"Too many shrill sounds on this cd. The ""new"" music is very uninspired. I really respond to the enormas power of Celine Dions voice but found much of this cd without any sublety. Very little shading. Just blasting, which we all know she can do. The old favorites are just that. They can stand on their own."
5,The great Celin Dion,"I am a Celin Dion's fan. Really, she is one of the best singer I know, maybe she is the number one. The voice of Celin is clear,beautiful, sweet. She could sing with differents singers with differents voices and always is pleasured to heard these song.I bought the former Celin's and I heard it avery day in order to understand every song.Every song sing by Celin include a message of love. I love Celin."
4,A Treat for the Ears and Senses,"Celine is always a pleasure to listen to and this recording is no exception. A good sampling of her past successes with several new delights tossed in. ""Mountains""is upbeat and fun. The duets are highlights-even the mix with ""Old Blue Eyes"". Anyone in love is bound to relish ""If Walls Could Talk"". But, did she really have to rehash Roberta Flacks ""Face""-a bit too dreary, as well as the final two cuts which could have been better used with more of her past glories. All in all, worth relaxing with, if not her very best."
3,Not her best,"I purchased this cd with the hope of hearing Celines strong vocal ability shine through, but unfortunately, with the exception of 1 of her new song, the other 6 new songs were slow and lacked the power and emotion that Celine usally demands. I did find her remake of The First Time ever I Saw Your Face, extremely pleasing to my ear. This is what I had hoped for from the whole album. Her old songs I guess made up for what the new ones lacked."
5,"On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this album a 9!","I love this album! Its a must have for any Celine fan, or just anyone who enjoys all-around good quality music. Its so great that Celine has finally released a Greatest Hits album. I love all the old songs on it. And the new songs are great too! Of them, my favorites are Then You Look At Me, That's The Way It Is, and I Want You To Need Me. Live, All The Way, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, and If Walls Could Talk are all good songs too! Honestly, the only thing keeping me from giving this album a 10 (or even an 11 :), is that they (Sony ? ) left off Where Does My Heart Beat Now. This is one of the songs that I would've most expected to be on there. It was Celine's first big hit. And for her not really being known in the US at that time, it was BIG! I can't understand why this song was not added...Sarah"
2,All the Way...to where?,"I've been a Celine fan for a while, but this album wasn't as great as I expected it to be. I really like all the ""hits"" that she put on the album, but I couldn't find myself enjoying the new 7 songs that she put on it. It just wasn't my cup of tea, although it was Celine style. If you like Celine's hits, but not all of her songs, I wouls say that this is a good pick, because I got it only because I wanted all her hits on one album."
5,Loved It,"I was also glad I waited for this CD to buy Celine Dion. I love the whole thing and the sound is wonderful. If you like Celine, this is the CD to buy."
1,oh please,"please people, can't u just wake up one day! celine's days r over, i hate to say this but i must agree with this! Mariah is better in many sense, though i am a die hard fan of celine dion, i must say that at least that mariah carey writes her own songs! please help celine!"
1,"The definition of ""schlock""","Celine Dion is one of the most popular artists around these days, so I thought I'd check this out ... It's appalling. Seems the Schlock Factory has been working overtime. ""Because You Loved Me"" is a particular low point. The songs are maudlin and treacly, the singing is way overblown, and it's all in all a sludge-fest of gooey sentimentality, bad songwriting and over-singing. Avoid."
1,MADONNA rulezzz,can someone just stop celine dion...she can't sing...MADONNA is the best! no one can compare with her! you are doom celine COCO LEE is coming your way!
1,pls oh pls,"celine dion, come on, i want some new songs, not the same old ballards that u use to POISON us... my heart will go on is history so does beauty and the beast and the power of love, can u do better than this"
1,regrettable,"i really regret getting this album, its a waste of monay, i have all the songs that was included, which is not her new songs, i my as well go get the singles for the new songs, a piece of trash!"
1,terrible voice,"she sounds the same, she looks the same...no sense of changing at all, and all she can sing is love ballards! my god have a life"
1,pls help me someone,"this album, i really hope that this is the last i see of her! she can't sing at all! and hse have to borrow her old songs to boost the sale sof the new songs and singles!"
1,A Decade Of Torture.....,"Celine Dion is unlikeable trashy music with no morals or relevance to the world that we live in today. Her voice is incredibly uncredible and slightly overrated yet good.Her music is terrible and absolutely vile, it makes me vomit and is unstickbale and unsustainable. She needs to go away, I cant take the pressure anymore. Too much, too soon!When I hear Celine Dion, I am reminded of heaven, she is a wonderful person with wonderful songs and should remain in our hearts and souls beyond eternity.Our hearts will go on beyond the Celine Dion hits factory of 1991....."
1,All the Way - A Decade of Boring Songs,"Celine Dion is perhaps the most overrated female singer in the world! She's ugly, lacks any real talent, and worst of all, sings nothing but love songs! I hate love songs. There are millions & millions of songs out there that are about love, and when I constantly hear songs that are about the same subject every time, it gets annoying. There are better things to sing about besides love. I like Marilyn Manson and David Bowie. They sing about all kinds of cool stuff!"
5,Love at first sight!,"Amazing! I heard it ""That's the Way it is"" on the radio and went out and bought it intsantly! A must buy for anyone Celine Dion fan or not. Who cares? This is Da Bomb!"
5,Celine Dion Rules!,"This is an awesome CD. It has all of Celine's hits-the still-amazing ""It's All Coming Back To Me Now"" and ""The Power Of Love"", the great songs ""Because You Loved Me"" and ""If You Asked Me To"" and the gentle, soothing ""Beauty And The Beast"" and ""My Heart Will Go On"". ""The new songs are awesome as well. ""That's The Way It Is"" rocks, ""If Walls Could Talk"" is fabulous and ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is one of the gentlest and most soothing song Celine has ever sung . ""All The Way"" is fabulous as well. ""Then You Look At Me"" and ""I Want You To Need Me"" send chills down my spine everytime she hits the high notes. ""Live"" is beautiful and tells how Celine feels about retiring. To all those who said that Celine is ugly and is bad-criticize what you can do better, OK?"
4,Almost All The Way,"To get to the point- some of her better songs are missing ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"" and ""All By Myself""But that's not half as important as the other new songs. OK< so Celine sounds good if not great on her duet and her cover of Roberta Flack's hit. But when it comes to songs like 'Live', 'I Want You To Need Me' and even the nice effort, 'Then You Looked At Me'just doesn't meet the expectations one would have of Celine.If you'd like to know what i mean, i'm talking about songs from albums like Falling Into You. Where are the grand ballads like It's All Coming Back To Me Now and by the way My Heart Will Go On is effective only once- the new Horner-Jennings composition sounds less dramatic although it is a beautiful song.Well, Celine- this album is great but not quite there. Hopefully, your next album will bring you back to your roots- your original french style presented through english songs and then you'll be all the way to the top.Celine dion, what a great voice."
5,"CELINE ""ALL THE WAY ""","THIS CD IS AWESOME, EVERY SONG IS WONDERFUL, I LISTEN TO THIS CD AT WORK, AND MY CO-WORKERS LOVE IT."
4,Great album for Celine fans,"This was a great gift for my Mother-in-law, who had this album, but left it in her car during a 100+degree day, so she needed a new copy of her favorite singers album."
4,Her best songs of her career,"This CD has been out for several years now. This is a collection of what will prove to be her best songs ever.Celine has always had a great voice. At this time she was singing wonderful songs that were well written. She had the best writers in the business and her songs showed it.The Power of Love, Beauty and the Beast, Because you Loved Me, My Heart will go on, amongst others are included here.To me the best song on this CD is her duet with the late Frank SinatraWith today's technology she mixed her voice with ""Ole Blue Eyes"" and really out did herself.This CD is loaded with classics............."
3,ALL THE WAY A DECADE OF SONG,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD, NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO MAKING THIS CD. THE SONG ITS ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW ONE OF HER BIGGEST HITS,THE SHORT VERSION WAS DISAPPOINTING THE LONG VERSION SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE CD. I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE TO COMPLAIN,I AM GOING TO WAIT FOR THE LONG VERSION ON SOME NEW ALBUM HER GREATEST HITS WHEN IT IS RELEASED"
5,Outstanding...a must,"I used to hate vocals. But for some reason, I became a Celine Dion fan and no longer hate vocals. In my opinion,Celine Dion has the best voice of any female singer. I hope that Celine will someday sing a duet with Jack Jones(my favorite male singer) that would be a sound to hear."
4,A nice way to bow out of the spotlight,"This CD was excellent, her mix of old songs along with her new ones such as the hit ""That's the Way It Is"" was great. The song ""The First Time"", was a beautiful ballad that showed Celine's talents. Her duet with Frank Sinatra, "" All the Way"" was put together nicely as well, a sweet tribute to the great singer. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a Celine Dion fan or is in the mood for a great CD that you will play for a while."
2,More Schlock,"The song, ""All the Way"" sounds like Celine just recorded herself singing along to a Frank Sinatra song. What a travesty! I know Frank recorded some awful duets on his ""Duets"" album while he was still alive, but does his memory have to be trampled on by stunts like this now that he's gone too? Celine, please take that time off you've been promising to do...and don't rush back!"
4,New York City Really Loves Celine,"The reason I did not give her % stars was because there are a lot of songs here that are missing to be a greatest hits collection. Where Does my heart beat now, All By Myself, When I fall in love, and Misled are just a few left out of the collection. Reguardly Celine's songs are timeless, and always remembered. This cd contains the power of love, her first #1, If you asked me to which is a forgotton song that was really loved, Beauty and the beast which i hate lol, Because you loved me, My favorite It's all coming back to me now with her powerful voice and strong piano, upbeat love can move mountains, To love you more with its sighing violins, My heart will go on gag gag, and I'm your angel. It also has 7 new songs including Thats The way it is which everyone knows by now. The other six are good too. Well get this cd cause I never owned a cd by her before this one and I love it."
5,She is THE Princess of Music,"I suppose the person who wrote ht e""poop"" review hd nothing better to do with his time. Nor did hte person who wrote the ""cheeseburger review"". Notice that neither gave a reason for their statements. I will for mine. Celine Dion is a wonderful, beautiful person with passionate, grammy winning music. She deserves nothing less then five million stars. 3 notes from one of her songs deliver more feeling and quality than Britney or Korn's whole album. I recommend this album to a true CEline fan and to anyone who actually has TASTE in music. This is full of old classics (Power of Love, If YOu Asked me To) and new hits (That's the Way it Is, If Walls Could Talk). You will not be disappointed."
4,Good CD (Not perfect thought),Is it me or just that most of my countrymen *loath* Celine. (And what is it about CoCo Lee?) Enough about other artists. This is a review on Celine's new album. You can say this album is a greatest hits album(half of the tracks are old hit) and a new complation(the other half are new tracks). Both for keeping fans happy and in the mean time expanding her fan base. Thought I agree with the other reviews that other more noticeable hits are not included in the album. I give it 4 stars (almost perfect. but then since when things are *totally perfect*)Joke time: What is the similarly of Celine Dion and The Spice Girls? (Hint: Singaporean's *Honesty* for music)Answer: They all bought their albums and like their songs...but *refuse* to atmit that they are Fans of these artists. :P
3,Enjoyable!,"I'm not really a fan of Celine's, but there are a few songs on this CD that I liked. I especially like 'All the Way'. It gave me such a great feeling about my relationship, I feel that way about him and it seems the song is describing the ultimate level of love that there can be. After hearing that song, I ran out and bought the CD for him for Christmas!"
1,i cant believe she's pregnant,"i cannot believe she's already bregnanat by her husband, i thought that i would have the chance to get with him, but she just broke my heart."
4,Caramello Celine,Celine- you did a wonderful job! Best of Luck to you and Rene'! Have a Happy and Relaxing break! You deserve it!
1,Cookie-cutter Collection,"When Lauryn Hill sings ""Everything you drop is so tired,"" Celine Dion could very well be the target of that blow. Blatantly ripping off a song is bad enough, but to copy off the Backstreet Boys, of all acts, is an absolute shame. Of course, I'm referring to ""That's the Way It Is,"" which is merely a rewrite of ""I Want It That Way.""Save the exquisite ""To Love You More,"" this album only showcases Dion's penchant for wasting her chops on lame material."
1,"Greatest hits that is missing her ""greatest hits""","What a shame it is to see Celine's people forgot the first two or three years of her career when they put together this little collection. MIA are ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"", ""If There Was Any Other Way"", ""Misled"", ""When I Fall In Love"", and the more recent ""Tell Him"". To me, this is the Celine that makes music. Not Celine the robot who churns out mellowdrama like its going out of style as eximplified by recent hits such as ""My Heart Will Go On"", and ""Its All Coming Back To Me Now"". For this, I place this collection back on the shelves of my local record store and search for another cd."
1,coco lee,she is gonna beat u in your game celine! coco lee is gonna be the next superstar and u r doom! maybe u should sleep with tommy motolla in order to win the game!
1,it makes me wanna sleep,"miss dion is actually repeating her songs over and over again! pls dun buy this album, its actually more of a compilation than an album!"
1,our lives take us down different paths,Cel's music is the sound of what happens to a woman who doesn't own any ministry and sold her goasts to be a pop star. Bring back Debbie Gibson all the cool kids scream.
1,NO STAR!,This is the worst album of 1999... It just gives me headache. Celine Dion had shown some musical talent in 'Falling Into You' but now... it's feels that she is just a women with loud voice. I think Britney Spears can sing like her if she had some vocal lessons. The new Diane Warren song ( I forgot the title) is just OK... but that's all...
1,AWFUL!,"Who really wants to hear a gazillion yucky songs? That's fine with me if you like that kind of music, but believe me, if you don't like songs like THAT, don't buy THIS CD. I have it in my house, and I'm sick of it. Especially since my mom LOVES it. She lives to torment me with romantic songs. So if you ever asked ME what CD to get, I'd say, ""NOT THIS ONE!"" Remember, this is just my opinion.I DO NOT LIKE Celine Dion. Used to. Back when I was tormented with her music. But now I'm not. If you want to get this awful CD, go ahead. I'm not stopping you."
1,can i have a refund,celine dion's album is a total wreck ! can i have a refund i hate her new songs more!
4,"I've Never Heard This CD, but I'm sure it's great.","I really want this album because I love Celine Dion's music. 'That's the way it Is' is an awesome song, but where are her earlier songs? This album also needs those songs. Oh, people who do and don't like Celine, please e-mail me. ;-)"
3,"A nice record, but not ""All The Way.""","As we look back in the 1990s, Celine Dion is a great singer whose voice is definitely touched by God. A great greatest hits album with some of her best songs. Songs like ""Beauty And The Beast,"" ""My Heart Will Go On,"" ""Love Can Move Mountains,"" and who couldforget her first #1 hit ""The Power Of Love."" It's like looking at a scrapbook of hitsongs. Her new songs are not to bad. I just wish she wouldgroove a little more like herlead-off single ""That's The Way It Is."" Her new version of Roberta Flack's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is pleasing to my ears, and her virtual duet with Frank Sinatra on the title cut is somewhat a change of pace fromher usual Pop/AC fare. I'm disappointed about some songs that didn't make the record, like her very first hit ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now,"" ""Water From The Moon,"" 'Think Twice,"" or ""Tell Him"" (her duet with Barbra Streisand).Now if she had released it asa 2 CD set, then let's talk about it further."
4,Celine,I just bought the CD 'All the way - A Decade of Song' by Celine Dion. This is a wonderful CD - it has enough old songs to bring back memories and also the newer ones that you currently hear. The sound quality is great!
3,Missing Songs,"I mean I love Celine Dion but what about her earlier songs, and all by myself is a major hit, forget about that one?"
1,Save your money!~,"Money doesn't grow on trees, and you should not spend it on a trash like this... It's just a piece of junk. Time to say good bye to Celine!"
1,Is this 'greatest hits album???',"I think Celine does not have as many hit songs to make a best album, and this album proves it. Half of the album is filled with the new songs!! And the new songs sound just like the other old ones... WHAT A DULL STUPID ALBUM IT IS!! This is just a piece of trash! And I really want my money back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Good new album.,Actually i want to give this cd album for 3 and a half stars but i think i rather put 4 stars. This album was not really bad and i loved it. I do not really enjoy 2 songs out of 16 songs. Especially 'The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face' and 'Live'. I loved all of the songs indeed. The song 'All The Way' that was written on 1955 and renewed is not really bad. I will give the 'All The Way' song 2 stars indeed. You're not gonna regret to purchase or hear this album. Get it and sit down relax hearing it...enjoy~!

That's The Way It Is16. All The Way
4,Celine- All The Way...,"There's no need say much. This great singer's voice says it all. She's sold over a 100 million albums internationally. This album is a good CD for anyone to own, big fans or just a music lover. This album could have used some more of her hits but other than that, its a great all around album. For those who oppose this artist, has a right to their opinion. But honestly, I don't think you know a real singer when you see one. Ms. Dion is obviously one of the best vocalist of our day!lscott7@yahoo.com"
5,A Celine Confession,"ok i must say that i am the person who wrote all those *one star* comments about Celine album. I write from singapore, n,y, brussels, just any city. I was very jealous of her singing talents on this cd. her voice is soo good on this cd. i love all the songs so much.i wanted to bring her down. BY far she is the very best in Pop music, i just can't take how good she is....she makes me jealous because her cd. sound sooo good. and she is making all the others like coco lee, mariah, madonna sound really bad. so now you know when you see all the *one star* reviews. its me trying to hate celine because she is too good, more than the rest!"
1,"she is god, my foot!","her voice is terrible her looks argh! disgusting! the way she sing is a torrid to listen and she actually claim that she is a diva.. my god, only iliterate would compare her with the likes of britney spears and christina aguilera, look sony has already decided to promote a really new star in their company, COCO LEE, she is gonna be a successor of celine dion, poor dion lady, u r doom!"
1,no breakthrough,"she sounds terrible, her voice is yucks! and r all her sounds repeating by itself...come on have a breakthrough!"
1,i can't believe this!,"u mean there r people who call this album great! my my my! celine dion is history her days r over and now other rule the world not her anymore, she doesn't have a voice of an angel but a horse instead and her face looks like one too!this album is a total turn-off learn from my mistake dun buy it!"
3,All The Way Up,"Since her American career started in the early 90's, Celine Dion has become a monarch of pop music today. Her beautiful voice, and tough determination still continues to rock the music world.Her 1999 Greatest Hits album, All The Way: A Decade Of Song consists of nine of her greatest hits from her six English studio albums: Unison, Celine Dion, The Colour Of My Love, Let's Talk About Love, Falling Into You, and These Are Special Times. Although her standards come out like My Heart Will Go On, Because You Loved Me, and The Power Of Love are in this collection, there were so many songs that didn't get into this collection, like her duet with Barbara Streisand, Tell Him, Where Does My Heart Beat Now, and When I Fall In Love, from Sleepless In Seattle.Although Celine has became the biggest selling female artist of all time, this collection is hardly up to those expectations. Nonetheless, for any Celine fan this collection might be worth the dollar."
5,Celine is great,"For me, this is easy. I've always loved Celine so for me, she can do no wrong. For some, the CD may not contain their favorites, but how can you put them all on one CD? There's not a bad, or even so-so song on the disc. Love it!"
2,An amazing voice & tired material,"Although the song ""That's the Way It Is,"" is another likeable Max Martin-pop gem, the rest of the tunes on this CD are pretty much overplayed 90s drivel. Even the new material (including an unfortunate, overblown remake of ""The First Time Ever..."") sinks fast. A better investment would be the 'Falling Into You' album, in which Dion's vocals are surpreme."
4,All the way,Celine Dion has a beautiful voice which never disappoints. This contains some of my favorite songs which made it the right choice for me.
5,Great quality!,"Brand new unopened CD, played flawlessly - will look to this site for other titles and recommend same to others........."
3,Good Greatest Hits collection,The first 2/3rds of this CD is packed with hits! Unfortunately the end has songs I never heard before... but still worth buying.
4,Celine Dion in multichannel SACD,"Celine Dion voice is really amazing, specially when you listen to the SACD multichannel format. You would feel that Titanic's soundtrack so powerful."
5,She's the best.,This album shows all the world she is the best in this music industry. A great mixture of Celine classics and new songs. Strongly recommend to all Celine fans.
1,Missing the best song!,"""Halfway to Heaven"" is her best song to date, and bingo, it's not on the cd...what's up with that? I guess that song is too soulful for most..."
3,decent cd by an overrated artist,"I first came to like Celine's music after seeing her performance of Power of Love on an award's show... After hearing more of her music, I was even more impressed. Of course, after hearing continuous radio marathons of My Heart Will Go On, as well as listening to her other top 10 hits on the radio,...well truthfuly, one can get tired of her voice.This album has all the songs that were overplayed on the radio, as well as a cover of All The Way. And if that's not enough, there's also a few lesser known songs on the album - none of which I would say is a decent song tho."
1,music is no longer music sad but true!,words cannot desribe my hatred for this womanshe has no singing talent whatsoeveri am a major in music and she is not music she is trash to the extreme if you kids of today call this trash musicthen i give up totallyreal music lies with these facts1. you must have songwriting ablilities2. you must be able to carry a tune3. you must be able to play your own instruments4. allof the above5. originalityunfortunately she has neither of these 4 qualitiesand she has the ugliest nose i have ever seen
1,A decade of rubblish,The Cd is absolutely a rubblish! PLease do not buy it and save your money for charity! Celine's Style and tone never change and it has already made everyone sick... I recommend those who want this CD to buy Whitney's CD.
1,WHAT A SLEEPY CD,"As if it isn't bad enough that Celine Dion is the same structured balladeer how about a full c.d. of the same songs over and over again? Well that's what you'll get from her newest c.d. which is such a cheap shot at lasting Celine Dion into the new millenium even though she supposedly is supposed to be going on a ""break"". She doesn't have enough greatest hits to call this c.d. a greatest hits c.d. so maybe that's why she included not one or two but SEVEN new songs. Obviously she does need a break and hopefully when she comes back in two years she will bring some creativity along with her."
1,STOP HATING MARIAH CAREY,"Listen up. First of all, I like Celine Dion's music, but I'm a hard-core Mariah fan. Listen, people who review Mariah's albums don't start comparing her to Celine Dion, that's because they have respect for both singers! Why are you people so ignorant and always have to compare her to Mariah Carey. It's always Mariah Carey this, Mariah Carey that..I'm SICK OF IT! Celine has a powerful voice and her song ""that's the way it is"" is a great song, but stop hating on Mariah Carey, u people need to hear better music overall....Celine's music is nothing compared to Mariah's music!"
3,ALL THE WAY.....OR HALF WAY,"...I don't think this is the proper send off for Celine. The album is called ""All The Way"", but where are all the hits? Sure Celine included all of hits, but there are a few she left out. What about ""All By Myself"", ""Tell Him"", or ""When I Fall In Love""? These were all hits, but you won't find them on this lackluster excuse for a greatest hits. Also, there are great album tracks like ""The Reason"", ""Immortality"", and ""River Deep Mountain High"" that are left in the dark. This could have been a huge CD, but instead it is a only a taste of Celine's ability. The new songs are a bonus, and ""That's The Way It Is"" is a wonderful and exciting track. However, the duet with Frank doesn't make your heart go on. Frank is a voice Celine cannot blend with. At times it just seems as if he is singing...she's singing...ok. Where is the balance and blend, emotion. ""All The Way"" is a good CD. Nevertheless, I think Celine should have done what the title said."
5,TREMENDOUS!,not at all like most greatest hits cd's it is a great blend of her greatest hits with enough new! material(for her) it could havebeen made into( 2) seperate albums! all together a greatso-long album to remember her by as she takes some well deserved time off
5,She's my inspiration,"I learn how to improve my vocal by her song. She is the only one I've ever dream to meet, hug and kiss. This album... oh, I just don't know what to say. I like the song ""All The Way"" so much. It's very lovely to hear at. What can I say more about her? She's my inspiration..."
4,Celine At Her Best,"Anyone who thinks Celine cannot sing needs to go out and buy Brittney Spears' latest album. This cd is one of the best I have bought in years. Not only does it include all of her greatest hits, her rendition of Roberta Flack's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is great! This one is truly for the fans, something to remember her by."
3,All The Way and then some,"Well Celine finally managed to pull off a collection of 9 old hits and 7 new songs, but still not a very retrospective record so to speak. Her maiden English hit WHERE DOES MY HEART BEAT NOW is solely misiing and that's the song that broke her into the mainstream. I wonder why To Love You More was included although it only did moderately well at radio. I would consider Celine's best to be the pre-Let's Talk About Love era, after which she, not unlike Mariah or Whitney, started becoming commercial and displaying full vocal pyrotechnics. But somehow she was more honest and less of a prima-donna! Missing are such celebrated hits like Where Does My Heart Beat Now, When I Fall In Love, Nothing Briken But My Heart, Think Twice, Misled and Falling Into You. For the new songs, the first single, That's The Way it Is, is a mid-tempo Celine-type songs, as unexciting as the title suggests. Only the virtual duet with Frank Sinatra deserves a mention for being fantastic."
4,A wonderful CD but lacks any reference to Frank Sinatra,"I think that this CD is a wonderful collection of Celine's hits and shows off her vocal talent very well; but, as a huge SINATRA fan (I am 35 years old) was very disappointed that there is no reference any where on this album that ""All the Way"" is a digital duet with ""the Voice."" I love the duet and hope that young people that do not know of Frank Sinatra will want to know more about this wonderful singer."
1,Blah? I'm not trying to be harsh here...,"I think Celine has a fantastic voice, but this latest material seems taken from the same cloth as her previous efforts. On top of that, the effort 'That's The Way It Is' is a welcome pace change, but seems to be a bit too childish in its subject matter for a 30-year-old woman to be singing. As for the remainder of the tracks (I do own the album, by the way), too many ballads that all sound alike without any truly memorable melodies. As always, her voice is in fantastic form, but for me, I don't know, I'm not a fan. I see that the sales of this album have been astronomical, and that a lot of people enjoy the music, and I'm not a pop-music basher in any way, but I feel there's a better use of her voice and talent if she and Sony would be daring enough to try moving her music in a different, less cookie-cutter direction."
1,BARBRA STREISAND SHE IS NOT,"THIS WAS A TERRIBLE ALBUM, GET WITH BABS AND GET SOME ADVICE BEFORE YOU CUT ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE THIS ONE. GOOD LUCK"
2,not her best form,"i actually sympathise with her plight, but sympathy doesn't go all the way, so miss dion pls do some realy solid music for us!"
3,"Hey, wait a minute...","This is not a bad album at all. I got it as a Christmas gift from a friend of mine. But HOW can Celine have a greatest hits album without ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now""? ""Misled"" and ""Think Twice"" should be here too. And ""My Heart Will Go On"" sounds better on the ""Titanic"" soundtrack.Other than that, not bad."
1,this album is a flop,"coco lee is coming your way celine, pls do something abt the cheapo compilation your company come out with!"
1,COCO LEE rulezzz~!,can someone just stop celine dion...she can't sing...COCO LEE is the best! no one can compare with her! you are doom celine MADONNA is coming your way!
1,too much to give u a star,"this is the most unsincere album i bought, she practically chuck all her songs from previous album into one, what is this? u dun have to earn consumers money by using this kindda method, this is apparently a strategy to promote her, since she is falling, they have to actually 'auction' her new songs with the help of the old onesZ!"
1,U R FINISHED!,STOP THIS SINGING CAREER CELINE DION! U CAN'T SING AT ALL! COCO LEE STAND A BETTER CHANCE! AND MADONNA CAN DO BETTER
4,She finally got to me!,"Okay, so I was one of the people who hated Celine Dion. ""My Heart Will Go On"" started to work on me, and I had to admit that I loved that song. Then I heard All the Way playing in a record store and I remembered how good ""Love Can Move Mountains"" was. Next thing you know, I was hustling to get this CD. I just wish it had a few more of her older hits on it, like ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now?"" I just love the new tracks, though!"
5,A Must For Celine Fans.,"This album is the ultimate album for Celine Fans. It includes her most well known singles including Because You Loved Me, The Power of Love, and of course My Heart Will Go On.( My question is why didn't All By Myself Make the cut.)The brand new singles are crowd pleasers. Heart wrenching ballads that made Celine a star. She sounds better than ever and each song she belts her heart out. She will definetly be leaving everybody wanting more Celine. Also includes the new hit That's the Way it is."
2,Dry as an old prune,If I didn't need this for a college course then I'd have not bothered. Dry as... it totally sends me to sleep.
1,Don't fall asleep watching this.,"Not the greatest thing to happen to space documentary videos. Most of the material is abstract and all of it is ""what if..."" material. Very boring to watch, not worth the money at all. Being a former NASA Moon researcher ov lunar photography, I wanted to see what this video was like, and to me it was a not so funny comedic video. Save your money. Purchase a Spongebob Squarepants video, more fun, even more factual. An insult to real space enthusiasts!Walk away from this one!"
5,spectacular documentary,"this is a very excellent video, factual, easy to understand, long and full of excerts good picture quality,audio is good too"
2,Computer recording enthusiasts: DO NOT BUY THIS!,"If there is anyone seriously interested in computer recording I would first check out the Edirol UA-4FX. It is a fully intergrated USB/Audio interface with 4 imputs including: 1 for MIDI, 1 RCA stereo imput, 1 for a dynamic mic/guitar and 1 for a condenser mic with the option to use phantom power, and whats even better is that is all USB bus powered. So there's no need for a power pack or bulky adapter, making it completely portable for you laptop people."
3,if at first it doesn't work....,ended up having to switch the MIDI IN to the MIDI OUT position to get it to work. am glad it did!
2,Sorry Yamaha!,"This is an expensive device, not worthy of shipping. I love myYamaha YPG-235 76-key Portable Grand Graded-Action USB Keyboard, but this cable is useless. As my good friend Stan would explain ""Nuff said!""."
1,does not work,"Doesn't work. Installed windows 7 driver from the website. The disc only supports Vista,2000 or XP.Tried on 3 different computers including an old one running Vista.I'm trying to connect it to a Yahama CP300 stage piano."
5,Works great!,"Installation instructions were easy to follow; connecting to my laptops was easy, and I was up and running in a matter of minutes. I read reviews of similar items that were much cheaper, but since I have a Yamaha keyboard (20 years old), I decided to stick with the reliable brand I trust. I've not been disappointed."
5,DX7,"This product works great. USB driver supplied by the manufacturer, installation was easy. It does what the manufacturer claims it will do."
2,Annoying,"My Win7 64-bit computer doesn't recognize this device on start-up. I have to wait until the computer boots, disconnect it from the USB port and reconnect it, and then it will work. I did upgrade to the Win 7 drivers. I also had intermittent issues of it working/not working when I ran it on another Win XP machine. Seems fairly reliable with Win7 other than the start-up problem.The writing on the IN and OUT cables is practically unreadable, so you just about have to guess which is which."
4,Just last night,"When were you in Viet Nam, just last night. After 38 years of leaving Viet Nam behind,that just last night comment made by the author hit home. For me that holds very true as I expect it does for many others. So many things in this book have brought back memories, things that I had forgotten and re enforced others that I thought were just my fading memorie at age 58 now"
1,Poor quality,Ordered online last Xmas and finally got around to opening it this weekend. I was dismayed to see that the top half of the 'bulb' had literally cracked in half.
1,BROKEN,Ordered as a wedding gift and quite a surprise to open it an find that the main section was broken in numerous pieces. Fed Ex must have air dropped it without the chute. Although I imagine amazon will make the transaction right.
1,"Thought it Was a Great Product, Boy Was I Wrong!","I was looking for a nice lunch tote and this one seemed to fit the bill. Well, boy was I wrong. After only 2 weeks, the blue fabric started pulling away for the top and the bag looked awful. Would not recommend it to anyone. No, I did not ""over stuff it either!"
3,it will do,i ordered this as a result of local stores running out before school started. it is much bigger than the normal lunch bag. it has already ripped by the lower section zipper and i have had to sew it (less than 1 month old). i hope it lasts the year!
3,"Practical, Durable and Compact","Insulated Lunch Bag meets the basic requirements for a good and servicable lunch bag. I especially like the insulated design and what appears to be good workmanship. It would ideal if it were alittle larger in the top section. I usually put a frozen block in the bottom zippered section to keep contents cold, but even if it's used for beverage, the overall size is 'compact'. This is my ""back-up"" lunch bag."
2,lunch bag,"The manufacturer of this product is fine, this particular lunch bag was too small for what I wanted."
4,Native Dash XP - Great glasses without Huge price,"I had a pair of Oakley half-jackets that these replaced. I really liked those sunglasses but felt like they were just too pricey. Especially with Polarized lenses. These Native Dash XPs do the job and I really like the fit and look of them. The only thing I dropped a star for is although the lenses are designed to be removable, they tend to come out a little too easy. For example, they were knocked off my face by my child and the lenses popped out. Not a huge deal as I don't plan on dropping them or having them knocked off often, but the lenses on my Oakleys never popped out."
4,Great sports glasses!,"This is my first pair on nice sunglasses so I have nothing to compare to except others I tried on while shopping. These looked the best and the lenses were simpler than some others to switch out. I'm also new to the clear lenses, which I think are awesome! They make the environment brighter looking than it really is and help with late evening activities. They stay put for everything I've tried so far, biking, running, serious sweating... My only minor concern is that they might touch your eyelashes if they are long. At the beginning they did at the top when I blinked sometimes but I think I've gotten used to it or something and don't notice that anymore. Some other people didn't like the gap at the top but that isn't a big deal to me either. My friend also got these glasses because she hates things touching her eyebrows."
4,Awesome older movie still makes me laugh!,Still a good movie after all these years......if you like Robert De Niro add this one to your collection ~
2,Not up to the hype...,"Hmmmm. It seems like a safe investment, doesn't it? Technics. Good company. But I've owned mine for a couple of years, and right from the beginning I've had lots of problems. CD's get stuck frequently, and it is NOT a good cd player overall, as some other reviewers here have mentioned, sometimes brand new cd's will skip terribly, so then you check your new album, and lo and behold...no scratch, nothing. And I too have taken mine to a repair shop, where I was finally told, it simply is not a good player. It's not all bad, but these are considerable problems( and if your cd actually does have a scratch, forget it. It's not worth the aggravation you'll go through skipping tracks, even a minute scratch...), and the pretty blue lights just don't make up for it. Don't say you were not warned..."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"I decided to pick this product up after I read a review from consumer reports. They said that this was the best one available. It was supposed to be able to play scratched cd's better then most models. I placed all my cd's in the changer and organized them by groups. I was glad to store most of my music collection in one place, but I have had several problems with this product. It jams up too often when changing discs. It also skips or doesen't play some cd's. I checked the cd's and there were no scrathces on them, so the problem was with the jukebox. When I remove a disc from the player, the artist and album title are erased from the memory and i have to redo all the input. I am not satisfied with this product overall."
1,smart but weak,"Smart but WeakPros: holds gobs of CDs, lots of featuresCons: too much reliance on plastic mechanical components.The Bottom Line: Buy it only if you treat your AV equipment like it's all made of thin glass.I bought my sl mc7 changer so I wouldn't have to worry about my CD inventory...it would all be in the unit.My frustration with keeping my CDs organized was replaced by a frustration with this player. It keeps jamming. I've taken it in for service, but the problem persists.I selected Technics based on a lot of glowing reviews on a number of sites, but this turned out to be a lemon.Stay clear."
1,Unreliable,I owned this player for almost two years before it had an irreperable failure. The same goes for the 60 CD version which I also owned for two years before its mechanism jammed and failed. This twice-shy buyer will never again buy a Technics or Panasonic product.
5,Great step by step,"This is a great book! For me as a beginner, I found the step by step style of this book easy to follow and interesting to read. It has really opened my eyes to how to get started on, follow through with, and finish a novel. It opened my eyes to some of the things that obviously make up a good novel, but I hadn't necessarily noticed them in all the books I've read. Frey helps you get started on brainstorming, figure out how to tell the story, and gives lots of advice on how to write good dialogue and prose. I know this book is great for a beginner, because I am a beginner. However, if you are experienced, this book may be a little basic, but could still be a good reinforcing read."
3,Hmm,"I think I may have missed the hype here...I didn't think it was as wonderful as all these ""top how to write a book"" lists claimed. It's okay but not great."
4,A damn great help,"How to write a damn good novel is a damn good how-to book.A no-nonsense approach to writing the best novel you can from characterisation, plot, climax and viewpoint.Every writer trying to get published should read this before submitting their manuscript or even starting to write."
1,A damn ripoff,"The section of 3 character dimensions, and the section of premise is ripped off The Art of Dramatic Writing by Lajos Egri. Once you get past that, you realize that this book offers nothing useful for writing a salable novel. Although it seems like the author knows what he is talking about, if you try to write from what you learn in this book, indeed in any such book, you will never publishin anything. Talent can't be canned or reduced to a set of rules. There is an exception to almost everything he says."
2,Outdated with bad tips,This book is horribly outdated and uses terrible examples to prove points. People who follow these guidelines are the ones responsible for clogging up the publishing industry with #$%^& novels.
2,James Frey -- literary bigot?,"I bought this book hoping to find ways to improve my own writing. While Frey introduced me to some new exercises, what astounded me was his remark on pg 37 (of the hardcover) in which he claims that without conflict Madame Bovary would have been ""no more worth reading than a Harlequin romance."" As a romance writer I wonder what Harlequin -- a huge, huge, huge publisher would make of that. No, I don't write for Harlequin, but I'm insulted all the same. Writers are writers, Mr. Frey. Romance fiction is built upon conflict. Readers of the genre can vouche for this. I'm disappointed by this book and by Mr. Frey's remarks. Perhaps I can offer a fix. Maybe the pg 37 could be changed to say that without conflict the book would be ""no more worth reading than a memoir that really isn't a memoir."""
5,If I could only have one book on writing this would be it!,"If I could only have one book on writing this would be it! - Minus Strunk's. There is more solid, professional, and practical advice in this book then there are in buying 50 other books on writing novels! The author breaks down all the fundamental elements of writing a novel into solid paragraphs, full of direct education and followed up by practical illustrations.The author will also sum up his topics with one-line anecdotes of what is being taught. Reading through this book you will find hundreds of one liners that will lodge into your head that you will no doubt call to mind every time you sit down to write. No doubt this has been the best book I have read on this subject - being a published author myself. This book sits next to my computer at all times!"
5,"Very informative, not dry.","I was expecting an essay-type book when I ordered this, the author uses humor to keep your interest while successfully explaining rather boring topics. I easily read this book in two hours without getting tired of it and retained most of what I'd read. This book tells you all you need to know about writing except what you should write about! I was impressed, it's not a very long book, but is packed full of good information."
3,Good but incomplete,"This helpful book should have been retitled ""Information About Writing A Damn Good Novel"" because that's just what it is. Everything the author includes is helpful. A novel must have to have characters that sizzle, he says. A good novel has dialogue which is in conflict and indirect, and it must have a premise. That's all true, all good stuff, but I was left wanting. You cannot read this book and then write a damn good novel just on what you learned here. I do recommend the book, because I learned good things by reading it. But don't expect to read it and then dive into your writing fully equipped."
5,"Excellent, practical resourse","I've published a half-dozen novels in the last five years with major publishers. I used this book, Chris Vogler's, and Bob Mayer's Toolkit as my base learning books on how to write a novel. Each one brought something valuable. Others have pointed out what this one has-- Vogler brings the essence of themythic journey and Mayer a very practical business and writing guide for the new novelist. I highly recommend all three."
4,Excellent resource,One of the best books for form and style. Targets character development and cohesion of action to plot.
4,Read Chapter 8 First,"The author's best advice comes in chapter 8: Rewriting. He advises aspiring novelists to join a ""destructive group"" that will tear your novel apart. That way you'll get ideas how to rewrite it and make it better. He even gives advice to those who don't have a ""destructive group"" and must make do with their friends --- or even just themselves --- as critics. And that advice is valuable. You might not think of it yourself.But still I don't know how anyone will ever learn to write by reading books on how to write. The other chapters about characterization, conflict, viewpoint, etc. are just amusing because of the author's no-nonsense style as illustrated by the author's first paragraph in chapter 1 where he compares creating characters to a bricklayer and a carpenter building a house. The style is just plain entertaining."
4,Useful book,"I wanted the basics of fiction writing. This book covers them well.The author is a good teacher and also brief. The book is copyrighted as of 1987 and was probably a reflection of classes Mr. Frey taught in the 1980s and before. It's possible the style of 2010 calls for more shock than in the time this was written. Still, the basics are probably eternal unless the writer is a brilliant innovator and can invent his or her own rules."
3,Lots of good advice,"If you are a prospective writer I recommend this book. Frey offers invaluable advice. Reading it, you can tell that Frey is a strong teacher.Why three stars? This book (at times) is so opinionated that it almost reads like a manifesto for hard-nosed popular fiction. Stephen King would agree with almost all the concepts within. John Grisham would agree with almost all the concepts within. Mark Twain, I fear, would not. Also, this short book is filled with excerpts from novels which he uses as examples. I'm not saying these examples were bad examples. However, Frey could have said the same things in seventy-five pages. Also, I am curious as to why there is no paperback edition available. Must be a money issue. That is, the publisher is afraid he'll lose money by lowering the price.Thanks for reading my review."
5,"Really useful, will read this kind of book anytime!","I like shown of the example very much. You can find a lot of important tips in this book. The best part is, after I have read it...I always comes back to refer it over and over again, because It's improved my writings!!!"
1,not very helpful,"I bought and read this book as part of writer's workshop some years ago, and found it extremely limited in scope and not at all helpful to what I supposed was it's market: just-published or not yet published novelists.The author turned out to be one of those writers who 'teach' that there is only one way to write a novel and see it published. That generalization pretty much describes his approach in a nutshell and I found it helpful only for some of the other sources on novel and fiction writing he does cite."
1,there's nothing new here:::::,"In a word, other people do this much, much better. I found nothing new or particularly valuable in this rehash of other people's advice. Also, his snide attitude about other genres (particularly romance) was uncalled for.Save your money...or spend it on Swain, Bickham, Vogler, King or one of the many other useful guides."
2,dangerous,"the author insists, so far as I can tell, that the only way to write a decent novel is based on some Aristotelean idea of the 'premise' which cannot be violated. 'Love leads to death' is an example for a character who dies as a result of being in love. This is nothing but an obscene simplification of the plot. It's absurdly reductionist.maximum capacity? A character's dialogue should always be the best thing he could say. What nonsense. How about the mistake, a common factor of life?Some good points on dialogue, though, but not worth the book.I think you could write a good novel with this book, but I think it would hobble a certain type of writer severely."
3,Saggy Middle!,"The chapter on character development was very, very useful, but 1/2 way through this book I put it down, bored. He seems to lose his voice/passion for explaining things at about that point. Classic saggy middle! Very disappointed after a great start."
5,Memory serves,"Hewlett-Packard used the Crucial brand of memory chips, so the decision to buy the Crucial product was logical when I decided to upgrade my HP Pavilion notebook computer. NOTE: The HP online store offered the same 1 Gig memory chips at a higher price. With Amazon's proven no-hassle return policy, and 3% rebate on Amazon Credit card purchases, it was an easy sale. Chips arrived in a few days (shipped directly from Crucial). Very satisfied."
1,Not recommended for young Hot Wheels fans,"I just purchased this DVD for my sons, and was sorely disappointed. We enjoyed the first Hot Wheels movie, ""The World Race"", very much, but Acceleracers - Ignition fell very short. The level of violence is a little higher than needed, and all the characters from the first movie are now members of an illegal street racing gang (not the professional racers alluded to in the ""World Race""). The story glosses over this, but it is this kind of ""darker image"" subplots that makes Acceleracers fall short of its predessor. Mattel needs to return to the original concept (the Fabian Nicieza version of the World Race characters), and drop the ""Fast & Furious"" angle for this Family movie."
1,Buyer be warned!!,"The Marketing masterminds behind this campaign are quite devious.This disk does not contain all realms as the product description leads you to believe. It only contains Storm and Swamp and NOT Cavern and Lava. This disk basically contains the 3 episodes that it has released via the individual disks with the cars.Apparently, the other realms will come available with individual cars to be released at a later time. Then Hot Wheels will release those two episodes on a disk, and then release yet another disk that MAY contain it all.My Kids were excited about this release expecting to get additional programming, only to be disappointed that there is no new footage on this release. There is no resolution to the story line on this DVD.In addition, you can not skip through disk, you can only fast forward."
2,World Race is at least 10x better,My 6 year old twin boys love World Race and were very excited when they found out there was another Hot Wheels movie. I was sorely disappointed in the AcceleRacers. It has much more violence and the animation is even more severe. I can only hope that the June release of the next (two?) realms will be more kid friendly and promote the team spirit that was conveyed at the end of the World Race movie.
4,GREAT ACTION,"My son and I just got this - he was a big fan of the first how wheels dvd. He really liked that the story continued and he also liked some of the new characters as well (especially Porkchop and the music guy). He loves the racing realms. The DVD also has new races through new realms in the special features. They are short, but my son really liked the bats in the cave race. OVerall Best part - the ACTION - even I was getting into it (I'm 34!!!). The ending leaves you wanting more, but I still recommend this..."
2,Mattel Flounders,"After Barbie lost market share to BRATZ, Mattel appears to now want some of those urban sales. In my opinion, Acceleracers is an attempt to make Hot Wheels appeal to that market. There is an emphasis on the street racer/tuner scenes with a simple plot.My 5 year old son loved the World Race movie; the animation, story, characters, and cars were of high quality. The first thing you will notice in Acceleracers is the animation style and technique has been changed to an exaggerated look which is horrible. The more realistic feel of the World Race movie has been lost in favor of a Sci Fi\Fantasy emphasis (the first movie even demonstrated heel/toe shifting, power braking, clutch use and other driving techniques!).Boys will find it enjoyable, but others that have seen World Race you will wonder what Mattel was thinking when they made this."
2,DVD Navigation,This DVD does not allow you to skip scenes or to choose which scene you would like to see from the menu. You have to watch the entire movie from begining to end which is really frustrating the mjaority of the time.
4,A bit mixed but overall a great option for the boys in your life,"I am thrilled that Hotwheels has expanded a line to coordinate with movies and toys. WTG hotwheels KEEP IT UP! It is very refreshing to have another option for the boys. One that isnt superheros fighting. I really enjoy many of the characters in this movie. The plots and different Relms.I do have to agree with some complaints. the angst they created between the teams is a bit too much in this movie on the verge of ruining it for me. And it is a bit too dark. My son is 5 1\2 and I do let him watch this one but probably wouldnt if he was younger.BUT the first movie wasnt bad, I have seen reviews that they lightened up the second part of this accceleracers series so I still reccomend this ""series"". If the movie was stand alone it would get a lower rating. But I am rating it in part as part of a great series and line for the boys in your life."
1,Poor sequel,"My sons loved Hot Wheels World Race so we were naturally excited when the sequel came out. Unfortunately this sequel was terrible. The characters don't even look the same and they certainly don't act the same. The first movie had a positive message and the characters personalities were highly developed. In Acceleracers the characters have no personality and some of them look like they have taken major steroids and yes they are shallow, violent and mean. Did the same guy write this one? The animation in World Race was excellent where as in this one the characters faces look bizarre and elongated."
5,Great Stuff!,"My son loves his Hot Wheels Stunt Track Challenge PC game. He's been collecting Hot Wheels cars. Then we discovered Hot Wheels Dot Com. We have found these resources to be exciting, age appropriate, and very well done. Then we rented an Acceleracers DVD. My son was blown away by the story and, of course, all the action. My wife and I were surprised to find the plot intriguing. Since then we bought all of the Acceleracers DVDs. They are great family fun and, in particular, our 6 year old son LOVES them. The Hot Wheels people have created a high quality video series that the whole family can enjoy. AAA recommended. JKT"
5,Hot Again,"Great follow up to the HotWheels Movie. Characters features have changed a little, but getting used to them is pretty easy. Loving the mystery behind it all, hope it has a stong finish. Mom checked, kid appoved."
1,Not for kids!,"We are a household with 2 boys, 1 and 4 - and luckily as a parent I previewed this movie before letting my son view it (which he never will). The entire movie was based on violence. The first scene had a fight between brothers, one apparently on steriods. Monsters, robots, yelling and fighting for 90 minutes... Worse yet is that the ending of the movie suggests another movie, or series of movies to complete the plot.This was so bad that I will be attempting to return it, and I have already filed a complaint with Mattel (who noted they sold the movie rights to another company for Hot Wheels)..Please note ""world race"" is a great movie, my son idolizes the characters and knows their names and the names of the cars. Acceleracers is pure trash."
1,Terrible Image!,"This camera is far worse than any of my other cameras, even my 340 line cameras. Edge sharpness doesn't exist. This camera is useless for surveillance. Unfortunately, the company doesn't allow the return of products in blister packs that have been opened. Obviously, you don't know if it works if you don't open the package."
4,USB 6GB Hard Drive,"This Hard drive is decent. Its kinda slow 4,200 rpm compared to the newer 5,400 and 7,200 rpms. However if your just using it to hold photos and other various files... its a good buy. 6 gb is perfect for a college student that has to carry c++ code and images to class. A plus for this HD is the sleek look of it. If your looking for a simple storage device but cool looking, I recommend this hd. It will have all your friends looking at your hard drive."
3,Worth reading for the style alone,"While this is an interesting read, I can't help but question the validity of the ""facts"" presented throughout. In a couple instances, Antonetta proves a point using unproven or downright false facts, as in the case of ""chemical memory"" in planarians who are able to complete a maze faster after being fed the bodies of their compatriots. (A simple search in wikipedia will show you this is not true: [...])However, these inconsistancies bothered me much less than they should have, since the book reads more like fiction than journalism anyway. I often forgot that this was a nonfiction book while I was reading. Antonetta rambles and mixes autobiography and opinions in with her facts, but her lyrical style would make anything hard to put down. This book is certainly worth reading, if only because the style is so unlike anything else that's out there. I just recommend taking her conclusions with a grain of salt."
1,Bad Investment : wasting time & loosing $ at the same time!!!!,"After reading the first 3 chapters of the book, it was obvious that the story was more fiction than real. Historical & geographical claims in the book do not match the facts, writing does not pay attention to details & the supposed story teller presents a narrow vision into events.It felt like I spent 2 bucks & 2 hours of my time to fix a broken dime!!"
1,Obvious its fake from its cover,"It's obvious this author is clueless about Iranian culture, otherwise she would not pick an image of a woman wearing a niqab in a country where women never cover their faces in such a way. I think she mistook Iran with Saudi Arabi."
4,Worth Reading,"The Characterization was a little weak, but I still liked the characters. The kid was cute and engaged in some entertaining antics. The hero was romantic, appropiatly smitten with the heroine, and his responsible behavior towards the heroine was commendable. Some of the plot elements were a little far fetched, but I liked the romance and adventure. This book was not perfect but I did like it."
3,Fair Read,"This isn't a bad read; the author is reasonably skilled. But the hero's refusing to marry a pauper because a previous wife hurt his feelings simply doesn't ring true to me. Nor does the heroine's refusal to warn her family that they might be in danger. That said, it's not too bad a way to while a way a few hours."
1,Worst read in a long time,"This book has a totally unconvincing plot and unbelievable characters who are constantly changing their attitudes and opinions about each other. I forced myself to finish it, since I had paid for it, and then put it in file 13."
1,Incredibly poor quality recording,The quality of this recording is so poor that it completely ruined any possible enjoyment of the music. I recommend NOT buying this CD and instead choosing another of George Shearing's works.
3,confusing,"I got about 20 minutes into this when I realized I had know idea what was going on or why. A quick web search showed that there was another, earlier series of this that ended with a bit of a cliff hanger. I wish Amazon would make this more clear when dealing with British series as I hate being dropped in the middle of something.As for the show itself, the Sandbaggers is far more interesting and realistic seeming than this."
2,Fine if idea of a black man being bought doesn't bother you,"Can't say I appreciated this remake which casts a black man being bought by a southern gentleman. Since Gleason isn't southern I know it was intentional. If that doesn't bother you, the fact that they spread the message on with a trowel will."
4,"This is a childhood classic,comedy at its finest.","This movie is not about Jackie Gleason being a slave driver to Richard Pryor,it is just the opposite.Jack accepts the job of being erics ""toy"" for a good sum of money.The movie is a good flick i have enjoyed watching since I was a kid back in '83.I enjoyed it then and I still enjoy it now.I must have seen this movie at least 50 times and I havent gotten tired of it yet.Its like a fine wine,gets better with age."
5,Not What It Seems!,If you think this movie is racist you have to be missing the whole point of Richard Pryor.He was trying to point out the absurdity of the situation and as it turns out most of the sonics applied to the movies plot have been discussed in the following reviews after mine.It's basically a lighthearted comdedy and is definately not pro-racism.In fact in the end the KKK get what they deserve.So it is okay to like this movie-I do.
1,Laughs Not Included,"The potentially hilarious teaming of Richard Pryor and Jackie Gleason goes to waste in this depressing 1982 farce. Zero chemistry between the comic legends, with director Richard Donner straitjacketed by an offensively bad script. Though the Pryor-Gleason pairing guaranteed its box-office success, ""The Toy"" would represent a career nadir for both men."
3,Time has taken its tool.,"I loved this movie as a child. I bought it for my family and I to watch. But I noticed some major errors in production. This is a fun movie, but as an adult... I must say parts of the story are just not right."
1,.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though Richard Pryor is reputed to be a comic genius, none of his anarchic spirit shows up in this painfully awful, terribly scripted, and non-sensical movie that features nasty people doing nasty things to each other for a seemingly-interminable running length; please stay away."
1,very hard to digest,being a Big Richard Pryor Fan it's hard to get into this film.seeing a Black Man used as Property for laughs&whatnot is not easy to take&therefore i avoid this film.it's not something worth watching it has a few ok moments but nothing worth talking about.
5,Great movie,This movie is funny and I recommend it to anyone who has never heard of Richard Pryor or Jackie Gleason.
3,as expected,Item received on time. Was rather scratched but its an old movie and the price was right.
3,Sturdy Construction,"My dad, who has Paget's Disease of the bone and Parkinson's syndrome with fairly rigid limbs, was not able to pedal on this unit even at the lowest tension setting. In fact, there was little distinction among the settings. It also moved about when in use and we had to push it against the wall to keep it stationery. Invacare makes a pedal exerciser that costs less and adjusts nicely."
5,Chattanooga Deluxe Pedal Exerciser,"This pedal exerciser is great! It's compact, yet sturdy and has more features than the competition. We bought this brand, based on a recommendation from a physical therapist and have been more than pleased."
3,Deluxe Pedal exerciser,One problem with the exerciser: you have to back your chair against a wall and weigh down each end of the exerciser (I use 15lb weights) so that you stay in place. But it is possible to get exercise from this little bicycle especially when recovering from a knee replacement. Good for arm exercise (place exerciser on a table) too during physical therapy for arms and sholders. I found Amazon to be the best price.
2,Disapointed,Simple to put together with included tools but was disapointed when I went to adjust the tension and a piece of plastic broke off the handle. The device creeps around the table top and is not too stable. I will attempt to return this to the merchant which could be a future review.
2,"Well made, but...","Upon the recommendation of a physical therapist, i ordered this and tried it-----not only for my own fitness, but to recommend to clients. Perhaps it functions best for those with taller frames, because although it was sturdy, compact, easy to assemble and use, i ended up with a dull, persistent backache. For leg pedaling, i tried placing the machine in several locations. yet it did not ease chronic discomfort after use. So, the machine did not serve me well with leg exercising, but was helpful with arm/shoulder rotations, i.e., set on a desk or table."
3,portable exerciser,"I purchased this for home strength training and for bad weather. The main problem I had was finding a chair of proper height. When in use it slides, so I have to put it against something."
1,WRONG ITEM FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS NOW,they have given me the worng item. I tried for 5 month to ge my real item but they have done nothing. Worst company.
1,Domestic Tranquility isn't,"I made it through the introduction and most of the first chapter of this book. By that time I had smoke coming out of my ears and my blood pressure had gone way up. This woman managed to trash working women, ethnic groups, women who choose not to have children, and women who, because of economics, have to work. But when she said that children of working mothers always turn out bad I had to quit reading. She managed to quote that old standby that working women were ""taking jobs away from men"". And she brought up the person that she sees as a purveyor of evil, Hillary Clinton. She should read Proverbs 31:10-31."
2,another person clueless about feminist,"seems like another woman thinks that all feminists are anti-homemaker... which is a concept that came from negative media images of feminism, not feminists! feminism questions why it is women who are always the primary caregiver... and feels that the role of homemaker (if the couple can afford to have someone stay home all the time) can be either gender."
5,I find in favor of the plaintiff!,"Mrs. Graglia utilizes her professional background in law to make an incredibly well documented (the end notes are incredible!) and exhaustive case against feminism. She accurately and persuasively connects the ""victories"" of feminism with their destructive results in woman's lives and in our society. This book is an incredible resource for women to help them cogently argue against a wrold view which has consistently removed protection and provision from them and their children. It also gives us ""youngsters"" insights into the foundations and original goals of the feminist movement. As a stay at home wife and mom, I appreciate the highly skilled representation I receive by this book."
4,A Most Riveting Expose' Against Feminism,"For years I grew up believing that the feminist movement was simply a backlash against male society's degradation of women. Yet, in a most profound and poignant fashion, the author reveals that much of the feminist group's beliefs, rhetoric, and actions are equally to blame for such debasement of their own gender, particularly women of traditional values. Many times, while reading a particular paragraph, I found myself saying audibly and emphatically, 'that is so true.' There is one criticism. While I certainly can appreciate her position on abortion and how well it ties in with feminist beliefs, it is quite conspicuous that she does not address the perplexities, extenuating circumstances, and even tragedies that a few abortions truly mitigate. A parenthetical statement would have sufficed. Overall, an affirmation and confirmation of my mother's choice to stay home and raise us. This book is a must-read for any man, woman, or couple."
2,only 1/2 working,"I was so excited about receiving this product. The soap pump works just fine, but the lotion pump never popped up so I have to unscrew it every time I want to use it. I'm disappointed. I thought about sending it back, but I didn't want to wait for a new one."
1,This seller is overpriced by 150.00,This Bible is not out of print. The same one I received was in the authors bookstore for less than 50.00. A difference of 150.00!! The picture is burgundy the Bible shipped was the same basic black Bible in store. Very disappointed. They charged me a restocking fee. But at least one person I spoke with was gracious.
5,Just as advertised,"This product helped tons and made the job WAY easier!! It's really worth the money, I will now change my impeller on a yearly basis."
5,Read it twice,"Everything you know about Christianity in today's society is challenged in this book. It's thoughtful, real, and moving. It will make you cry, laugh, and think about the way our world is heading. It will make you remember what Christianity was all about. I've read it several times now, and will never tire of it."
2,Good Satire but Main Character Didn't Ring True,"The buildup in the initial chapters was good, with a near-future scenario that satirized the encraochment of the religious right into every aspect of American life. But Jay, the new messiah seemed a little more like a symbol than a real character.Though it's kind of dated now, I prefer Theodore Sturgeon's Godbody as a tale of the savior returning in a new guise."
3,Typical,"Nothing new here in the ""Messiah"" genre. This one is hispanic. Other than that, same old, same old."
2,Testosterone deficit,"He is simply pandering and scoring $$ by using his wit to attack everyone's favorite whipping boy. Would that Hendra had the balls to point his wit at something a little more controversial, say the religion of peace (according to President Bush). I think a nice book about Muhammad's Y2K re-incarnation would be more exciting, and potentially explosive for Hendra's notoriety."
4,Flawed but thought provoking,"This is not a great piece of literature. The placement of the story in a United States run by a ""Christian Taliban"" government is never believable. Plot developments mirroring the life of Jesus take place far too quickly to elicit an emotional response. The characters are never developed beyond stereotypes. Yet, author Tony Hendra has produced a thought provoking novel posing the question what would happen if Jesus appeared to correct the mis-interpretation of His message. After reading the book I felt energized and captivated by the underlying message of the book. It can be found in one of the quotes of the Messiah character in the book - ""All evil begins with this belief: that another's existence is less precious than mine."" Reading the book caused me to reflect on my own spirituality. This novel takes ""what would Jesus do"" to another level. I strongly recommend it, despite its flaws."
1,the description is not same the part what i got,"this is not acceptable at all the picture and the description is not same as the part i got,,, i got Disc Brake Caliper not a rear brake pads. you didn't care about the rest of things, i am parking my car for 1 week in garage just waiting this part and now i have to wait again and again to be honest ,you have to check the item b4 you sent it to the customer"
4,Phantom Ace,"The story of Randy Cunningham's Vietnam experience before, during, and after being shot down by a NVA SAM. He and his RO, Willy Driscoll, bailed out over the sea and were picked up by US forces. Randy's story is amazing, exciting, and provides a glimpse into his abilities, character, and values. I met Randy at an airshow in 1986, before he retired from the Navy and went into politics. My admiration of ""Duke"" Cunningham as an awesome fighter pilot continues, but I am appalled and extremely disappointed by his ""bribes for contracts"", which showed the dark side of his character and values. God can forgive and change lives if one repents and is remorseful, but the effects of Randy's actions will last a long time and have affected many families."
1,Not practical,None of the pockets in this wallet are large enough to fit business cards or credit cards without considerable effort. I had to bend my cards to get it into the pockets and it took me just as long to get them back out.The amount of material in this wallet is also considerable. It is much thicker empty than my previous wallet is when full. I couldn't sit down comfortably with this product in my back pocket.
1,Too Small,I thought it was great wallet until I realized that my ID and credit cards could not fit into the slots without squeezing them in. I was totally disappointed since it had a good size section to hold cash.
3,"Bulky, but quality","Great condition, but bulky after filled. Took a long time for my husband to wear is down, though when it's sitting on the table, it still opens a little. Also, he likes to have his wallet in his front pocket, so I don't think it would be a good choice for someone who likes their wallet in their back pocket (hurt the back/side). I would recommend a bi-fold wallet, rather than tri-fold, for those people."
1,Good hidden key slots,"The ""Hidden two key slots"" were the main reason I gambled on this wallet because this is a must for me. Well, they are so well hidden that I couldn't find them, keeping in mind that I was looking for the same type as in my current worn out wallet and then in desperation anything that looked remotely key-holder-like. While looking for them however I found that the material seperating two of the six card slots was not attached to the leather and would sag and allow the cards to rub if inserted.As no pricing/shipping details are allowed in a review, let's just say generically that the shipping was almost as much as the item price, so it's not even worth the shipping to return it.I'll be shopping locally for this from now on.Other than that, it looks like a fine thick wallet made in India."
5,Smooth Jazz Vocals,I first heard Giacomo on Jazz with Bob Parlocha. His voice was so smooth and elegant that I decided to purchase this CD. One of the best vocal purchases I have made in 10 years. His phrasing and melodically rich voice is an instrument. It blends with the other instruments to therapeutically message and feed the hunger within for quality jazz. You can't go wrong with this one!
1,Caduceus...not Staff of Asclepius.,Do your research people. This is a Caduceus...commonly mistaken for the symbol of the medical field. The correct symbol for the medical field is the Staff of Asclepius (found with different spellings) which is a worm around a stick. The symbol comes from the way a Guinea worm is removed from an infected person's body. It's rolled around a stick and removed slowly over weeks or months. One worm...not a snake...on a stick without wings.The Caduceus is a totally different story with a different origin and was mistakenly used as the medical field's symbol somewhere in history.
1,Not the rod of Aesculapius!,"Instead, this is the Caduceus--look it up. Nice try, guise, but no cigar. Not even related to the rod of Aesculapius, which has only one snake and no wings."
2,Big Letdown,"This small paperback book is taken from material used in the late 19th century.I had hoped for detailed instructions about how hairstyles (specifically for long hair) were created.The illustrations are artistic views of each hairstyle -- but only one view is presented - usually a profile or 3/4 view. There are no detailed illustrations and the written commentary is sparse. Also, there are references to hair items that are not known in this era - and no glossary to explain exactly what the word means - so you are left in the dark.This paperback - in my estimation - is purely a ""curiosity piece"" and falls way short of being any kind of help in re-creating the beautiful coiffures of the 19th century.One last thing - many of the styles call for switches or fake hair pieces."
2,claims are overstated,not that sharp... i bought it to weed between patio stones (square)... and it doesn't really do it well.. its a waste of money.
2,VERY Disappointed,"I have purchased 2 pairs of these Jensen JHW200 series headphones prior to this set. I turned a blind eye in the past to the fact that with regular use, they only last about 1 1/2 to 2 years before one, and shortly thereafter, both of the channels fail, because of the sound quality and comfortable design. This newest set, however, delivers neither. I have a job where I'm at a computer all day, and am somewhat particular about music clarity and sound, not a nut by any means, but I like good highs, deep bass and good clarity. The previous models provided exactly that. They also fit much more snuggly, and the speakers themselves were double the size. I realize that they are only a $ 10 set of headphones, but compared to their previous excellence, these ""updated"" headphones fall far short. On a side note, I would not have purchased them had I been able to get a hold of ANYONE, be it via phone or e-mail, to redeem the ""Lifetime Warranty"" that they promise from my previous set."
4,informative,this is a very easy to use book and realy allows you to under stand the gourds propertys amd its flaws
2,Mounting problems,The mounting brackets were opposite from MB. If your MB doesn't have all four hooks around NB then you must make sure yours are on the right side as the cooler. Mounting clamps for cooler are not reversible they only go on one way.
5,it cools!,Pros:easy install (as long as you remove your old one without any damage)Cools a few degrees better the most stock coolersLooks cool! ;-)Silent (i know.... its fanless!)Cons:Needs airflow for best operationif you are building a fanless system... monitor you temps!
3,Makes too much noise,"I have the 30 GB portable firewire hard drive. The hard drive is great because of the size which makes it easy to carry around. The issues I have with my drive is that it makes a buzzing sound when it is mounted. It's louder than any drive I've ever had and becomes annoying after a few minutes. I wrote VST support to verify that it's suppose to buzz and have not heard back from them for 2 days. I call their support line (not toll free) and I'm constantly on hold forever.Also, I was disappointed with the color of the hard drive because all the pictures that are associated with the 'graphite' color looks gray. The actual color of the 'graphite' color is a light grayish blue. (It's less attractive then the gray, so don't get too hooked on the gray because you'll be pretty disappointed.)"
4,Bring work home,"This is the first VST product I've bought---since then, i've only bought VST brand HDs---not just at home, but also at work. Unlike it's brother, it does not rely on a AC adapter for power, which is a real plus when bringing work home. The data transfer is great for a few files, but don't expect speedy transfers when trying to copy huge directories (ie number of files) but in single (or smaller #) large files, the copy speed is great. The hard plastic shell has proven time and again that this is a durrable drive, designed to take more than just desktop abuse. With the two FireWire ports on the back, this drive can be daisy chained with other FireWire products. With great customer support (VST) and my past experiences with their products, I would recommend this drive for both the office and home."
4,dessert island,"OMGosh, what a hoot! This book was so good. What would you do if stranded on an island with a hunky guy? This book fills in the blanks and more. What ever I paid for the book was WELL worth it. M.Margaret Neil really kept the story going with NO boring parts. The quick one-liners were an added bonus."
3,dessert island,this book is utterly charming . a terrific book that i could not put down. i recommend it highly.
1,Don't Bother! I got hosed on this one!,"Length:: 0:06 MinsCaveat Emptor. This is NOT what you expect. It is essentially 5 incandescent Christmas tree blinker-bulbs in a plastic ball - powered by C-Cell flashlight batteries. It does NOT have LEDs in it and DEFINITELY is NOT a Strobe. Get something ELSE !! I suppose it's my own fault for not reading more closely.-OK - just to be fair - today I put batteries in the thing and turned it on. As expected (and unfortunately, because I actually bought TWO of these useless things) - IT IS totally USELESS. It is a WASTE of your carbon footprint to even put batteries in this (even if you DON'T believe in global warming - which I don't - it is STILL a waste even of something equally as useless AS a carbon footprint).-SHAME on the Chinese for even coming UP with useless trash like this.Oh - - you don't believe it could be that useless?Take a look at the video (uploaded from my iPhone 4)"
1,Useless,"In the internet world, does it make sense to print companies' name contacts ? I don't think so...This book with 117 pages, waste 68 of them with contatcs names. Additionally, the author does not present deep insights of how get sponsorships."
4,Pretty solid,"While not my favorite book that I've read in the 33 1/3 series, Davis's book on IV does a nice job of exploring some of Zeppelin's influences and does what this series is so great at--it brings the album back to life. Sure the book may be a bit flawed--of course it's far better for most of what passes for music criticism these days (33 1/3 is, by the way, consistently better than most, especially in terms of exploring historical and social contexts)--but it made me bust out a record that I thought I'd listened to death and fall in love with it all over again with brand new ears. I could write similar reviews for every book in this series that I've read, but I just happened to check out the page here and thought I'd weigh in with my opinion."
3,Disappointing,"Although the author is knowledgeable in both esotericism and rock music, he does not put his observations together in any meaningful way. He jumps from idea to idea, throwing in some insightful comments seemingly at random. I bought the book with high hopes but was pretty disappointed. Led Zeppelin have received much more thoroughgoing analysis elsewhere. It's not a bad book, just overly casual and journalistic."
2,blah blah blah,"this book on Zeppelin 4 is around 170 pages. the author actually starts talking about Zeppelin 4 around page 70. everything before that is masturbatory gushing over jimmy page and his occult fascination. once he actually gets on the topic of the book, zeppelin 4, the author works painstakingly hard to continue tying almost everything into the occult. and it only works in the most convoluted far fetched manner. zeppelin is bigger than jimmy page. and jimmy page is bigger than his fascination with the occult. i wish the author had appreciated and respected that when writing this book."
3,"A decent over-analysis, better than the Sabbath book","You won't learn anything about the making of this album. Recording details? Forget about it. It's all pretty much an over-anaylsis from someone who: a) had way too much time on his hands, and b) got WAY too into Dungeons and Dragons and other such things when he was younger. But he's been quoted on the Wikipedia page about ""Stairway To Heaven"", so take that as you will. If you view this album as a concept based on the lead singer's journey on a quest of unfullfilment (sp?), and you think that ""Black Dog"" is a sort of Satanic ritual, then buy it and read on. If that sounds like a load of crap to you, than avoid at all costs. BUT, at least it is interesting to read (even if I don't agree with his convulted over-analysis) and as such it much better than the load of crap that serves as the Black Sabbath ""Master Of Reality"" book in this series."
1,Don't buy it,"I'd like to reinforce the reviewer before me. We also got this as a present & we were really excited. The questions were inanane, there were lots of spelling errors, & the ones that weren't outright silly were so subjective it's impossible to guess which answer they were looking for. We won't be playing it again. It's too bad, it was a great idea."
2,Only for the SERIOUS Beatle Collector,"I enjoy this disc once in a blue moon, and has you know, that isn't too often. Sounds like it was recorded live, but in the liner notes it only says; ""Recorded August 25, 1987 at Eastman Theater, Rochester, NY."" As stated in the title header-only for SERIOUS Beatle collectors, In my opinion.Pop Go the Beatles"
5,Holding the dream,I think Nora Roberts is a fantastic author and my kindle lets me slowly catch up on her books at a lesser costthan buying books in stores.I need to get a list of her latest books.
4,Nora Roberts has done it again,Plot is quite good and the book is fun to read. I enjoyed the entire trilogy and recommend it to others.
3,An amusing read,"There are other Nora Roberts books that I have liked better, but as always this author can be depended upon to deliver exactly as promised. This was the amusing, enjoyable, emotional read I expected it to be. While I definitely preferred Roberts' previous Irish trilogy, especially BORN IN FIRE, I still gobbled this book right down. Part of Roberts' appeal is her ability to depict family relationships. By now, I feel I know the Templeton family as well as I do my own. I will certainly be looking out for Laura's story when it arrives"
4,Another great Nora Roberts story!,Can't wait to read the last book in the trilogy and see what turn Lara's life takes and how Pretenses grows.
3,(Sorry) This One Was Merely Okay...,"Although this was readable, it's one of those books that just didn't hold up to this author's talent. It was pretty boring, actually. Nothing like the first book in the series."
1,"Now, this IS drivel. . .",I bought it by accident! Honestly! I was stuck at O'Hare and had just finishedAmy Tan's latest (which I DO recommend) and needed somethingto pass the time on the next leg of my trip and this was the ONLY seemingly non-thrillerat the newsstand. I should have known better when the author'sforward waxed poetic about the honor of pretending to be herheroine during her writing of the book. A ten for trash!
4,Holding the Dream,Holding the Dream was very good. I like to read Nora Roberts and also JD Robb books. I will be starting book 3 soon.
4,Holding the Dream: The Dream Trilogy #2,"In keeping with Nora Robert's prior trilogies, Holding the Dream rivits the reader who is anxious to find out ""what happens"" next! Bringing the characters to life, this book continues the saga of three women, sisters by cicumstances and their personal trials. Roberts creative writings hold the reader's interest and imagination, bringing the characters so to life that one has no choice but to anxiously await the next book!"
5,Examples and problems work well with MathCad,"Book offers an over view of the problem, without becoming bogged in ""favorite"" topics. Integration of soln. with Mathcad and actual simulations are relatively easy. Description of z^2 plane fractals as an exception (also the start of fractals in more complex systems)is worth price of book alone. Drazin's ""outline"" for the analysis of non-linear systems is a pure bonus."
3,"Not much about the F-16, but good video","If you are looking for an in-depth look at the F-16, this DVD does not deliver. I'd say this DVD presents a grand total of about 5 minutes of F-16 footage.Why did I give this DVD 3 stars? It contains some truly amazing footage of arial combat during WWI and WWII. From the cockpit, we see and hear what a fighter pilot of the time would see and hear, and watch as bi-planes and single-engine WWII aircraft get blown out of the sky. Those views saved this DVD from 1 star."
3,OUT OF THE SUN - THE F 16 STORY,"THIS DVD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE F-16,BUT GIVES REASONABLY GOOD BUT SHORT COVERAGE OF WW1,WW2 FIGHTER INFO AND INTERVIEWS.DO NOT PURCHASE IF WANTING F-16 FOOTAGE."
3,"Good, but not as good as Tsuji's other book","Tsuji's Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art is both monumental and seminal. This one, taken from his notes and finished by an assistant after his death, is just average. The first book doesn't have many pictures, though, and this one is full of them.If you really like pictures, pick it up, but the pictures are the best part of the book. The recipes suffer by comparison. There are other cookbooks that teach the same things and do it better.I bought it on the strength of his name, and have been vaguely disappointed ever since, though I do page through it for serving ideas because a lot of the pictures are gorgeous.(Full disclosure: I've semiprofessionally taught Japanese cooking classes.)"
5,Great Lego Star Wars Set,"My son has loved the Y-Wing fighter in the movies. This set is FANTASTIC! I've been a fan of Legos since I was a kid and have had many sets. Some are better than others, and some are a little flimsy if they are going to be played with - this one has held up really well. It is also really authentic looking - very detailed. Overall VERY happy with this set."
2,something missing,"This is a major disappointment as most of the beloved Carry On gang are missing. Sid James appears five times, Hattie Jacques only once and Kenneth Williams and Charles Hawtrey not at all. Laughs are scarce and it's easy to see why this series was short lived."
4,Good but not great,"I love the Carry On films but the TV series doesn't quite reach the same potential. Not all the actors who made the movies what they were show up in the TV show, which is too bad. However, the writing is good and the humor is kind of the same. Certainl better than the average TV program being produced today!"
4,Carry On in Heaven!,"I guess I was lucky that I picked up this gem at a discount entertainment store. Anyway, I would have liked to see more of Hattie Jacques but I was glad to see the wonderful Joan Sims who was simply one of the most brilliant and gifted of all British comediennes. Why she didn't get Damehood is beyond me because she simply was brilliant and underestimated. She could play Queen Guinevere, a matronly housekeeper, or a drummer. The laughs are not hard to come by. Babsy Windsor does play that role of ditsy blonde too well. I like watching Kenneth Connor, Sid James, and the Carry On Gang. Now, I wished they did a Carry On Shakespeare edition."
3,interesting read,"interesting read, some insightful observations, but I don't really see how it is going to help me get things organized. sorry. Thats not the books fault though, the responsibility for the messiness rests purely with, (gulp)......ME."
5,The New Hot Sensation!,"I haven't heard an album this good since Prince. Especialy, Wild Bill, he bust the dope rhymes. I know that in just a few months they'll be on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spin!"
4,Birthday gift for Maltese,Same toy bought 1 1/2 years ago for neighbors dog. Needed new one. Found it on internet and ordered it for her 2 year birthday. It was a big hit and she thought it was the original one.
2,This pushed my biggest button,"I've read the entire series and enjoyed them. Great characters, fast pacing, fascinating world. But I have a major problem with books or movies that depict the torture/murder of children. I can cope with it happening to adults, but not children or infants. If I had had any idea what happened in the hospital scene, I would never have checked this book out from the library. At least I didn't buy it. And I won't be buying it, hardcover or paperback. I really enjoyed the earlier books in this series. But a depiction of the slaughter of newborns is NOT entertaining to me."
2,Bored,"This is my first go around with an Anita Blake novel, and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. I thought the novel's sense of place was very poorly done, and wonder how much field research was actually done on location before the book was written. Anita Blake alludes to the Sange del Cristo mountains, when the common term for them is Sangre _de_ Cristo. A fine point, admittedly, but that's what they're called. That, and an allusion to good Mexican food, is about as far as the background research goes here.In spite of the juicily gory hospital scene, the pace of the novel's early stages was almost glacial. And finding that I cared not a whit about any of the characters, not even Anita, I put this one down.But I did give the first novel in the series a quick look, and it did catch my interest, so maybe the ennui that seemed to permeate ""Butterfly"" is more due to Anita Fatigue than anything else. It would seem to me to be a difficult thing, to write about the same character(s) book after book."
5,Obsidian Butterfly,"I just wanted to say that when I received my book it was in excellent condition. I had borrowed this book from my sister-in-law and forgot it on a plane while travelling. So when I replaced it, I was happy to find that it looked brand new. Thanks so much. I now go to Amazon for all my books."
3,NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES,"THE REASON IT WAS NOT THE BEST IN THE SERIES BECAUSE JEAN CLAUDE WAS NOT IN THE BOOK AS AN ACTIVE CHARACTER. THE SAME FOR RICHARD. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED THAT THEY COULD HAVE MADE A APPEARENCE. AH, BUT I WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NARCISSUS IN CHAINS COMES OUT I KNOW LKH WANT DISAPPOINT ME ON THIS BOOK. I HAVE READ EXCERPT AND THE EXCERPT MAKES ME CRINGE IN MY SEAT. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHO ANITA WILL END UP WITH. THANKS LAURELL, I LOVE YOUR BOOKS. MY FIRST BOOK WAS THE KILLING DANCE AND FROM THEIR I BECAME ADDICTED. THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE. TAMMI"
2,Disappointing transition to hardcover,"Not bad, but nowhere near the standard of the series. Lots of filler in this, like LKH was stretching to fill so many pages. Anita may be reaching the end of her reign as the best hardboiled-detective fantasy heroine I've ever read."
1,Major disappointment in this series,"I love the Anita Blake series, but this book literally made me sick. Fans of the series will enjoy it up to the near end, with the first real in-depth examination of Edward's character, but Ms. Hamilton, child molestation and child torture are INEXCUSABLE under ANY circumstances. Two pages ruin this entire book. Skip to number ten and avoid this one at all costs."
4,Edward? A person?,"Obsidian Butterfly. This was a novel which has redeeming qualities for the Anita Blake series. Edward, which has previously been a favorite and amusing character, is metamorphosized into a real live person. This in itself drew me into the novel with a force lacking from the previous novels, from the lunatic cafe up through blue moon. The previous novels were okay, but their focus was on Richard and Jean-Claude way too much. Edward was always the focus on the action and blood, and while he is here in full force, Edward is also coming into a depth unbeknownst before. The only problem I had with the novel was the main bad guy at the end. He was confusing, and although he was a vampire?, I am still left wondering as to how he became so powerful and unlike other vamps... The foreshadowing at the end about Otto and the guy who trained Edward, though leaves me in deep anticipation for the future Anita novels. This is a very good buy and novel in the Anita Blake series."
4,Need better editing,"LKH needs a graveyard full of editors...in earlier books Anita has her car totalled then after being dropped of at home by a co-worker, she receives a call from Dolph, and she drives to the crime scene, excuse me... what did she drive? Also, in Obsidian Butterfly, ever notice how Dolph became Dolf? These books are good, but I think the series could be much better if things were to flow smoothly, which would mean...without errors or time frame mishaps. Overall, wonderful books, must read in order, Anita has not only aged with the series but her gifts have grown as well."
3,More Edward!! More Edward!!,Cool book but I would like to have a book written from Edward's point of view. That would be awesome. With names like Death and the Undertaker he is where the real story should have been.
1,Lord have mercy.,"This was my first Hamilton book. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages. It is really poor. Some of the similarly rated reviews will give you a better idea - I don't want to waste any more time with this book.I'm not a diehard vampire fan, but I've read some Rice books and others, this has to be one of the worst I've seen. The plethora of mystical/fantasy stuff is so omnipresent that it takes away from the fun and mystery of it all. There is a lot of filler too - this author seems to have trouble quickly moving the plot along. I got tired of repetitive descriptions of Edward's ""dead eyes"" and boy, watch out for that killer description of sopapillas and sage honey. Lord have mercy."
2,Time for Anita to take up knitting and marry a minister.,"Laurell Hamilton has a good thing with her Vampire Hunter books. I really enjoy the series. Although the action is fantastic, the gore factor is climbing - we're hopping from one blood bath to another. It gets old. Despite the silly story line, Ms Hamilton once again creates some wonderful, if not sociopathic, characters.She also seems to be painting Anita into a corner as to her character development. Where at one point we might root for Jean Claude or Richard as her would be permanent partner. Anita is now getting so brittle and less sympathetc (as we endlessly hear through the character's internal dialogue) that both guys deserve better!The characters and world of the Vampire Hunter series can certainly continue, but Ms. Hamilton may consider writing one last Anita Blake book and tieing up loose ends (but not without your basic silver bullet/crucific wielding rock'em sock'em ation ending)."
2,Kept me from reading her next book for over a year,"I'd have to say that this isn't on of Hamilton's best works. With the last book, I've begun to notice that the series is taking a turn for the worse. Even though I've always gobbled the next book in the series as soon as it comes out, this book kept me away from NiC for over a year! NiC is even worse than this (you can read my review for it). But back to OB: the plot is still ok, but the scenes of violence are getting to the point where they don't really belong in the book. Hamilton tries to shock her readers, adding more and more violence. Also, I find Anita's character is beginning to get on my nerves. Before I could relate to her; she was a woman, petite, and had to be tough in order to survive in this type of world. However, now she's just annoying, but a I'm tougher than you attitude. You can't turn a page without her comparing egos with the guys. It is annoying as hell. It is a like a testosterone driven teenager in Anita's body."
2,My Last Anita Blake Book,"I started at the first book in the series and was interested enough to continue reading. The stories started deteriorating into repetitive ""I'm badder than you are contests"" and the sex ramped up to the point I was skipping most of the pages trying to find the plot. The final straw was I lost any respect, sympathy, or admiration of Anita and realized I actually don't like her. What a pain in the posterior she is and why would anyone like her? Blue Moon is tiresome, but I forged ahead with this book. I couldn't finish it. It's to bad because some of the early books were actually interesting."
1,Where has all of the fun gone?,"Laurell K. Hamilton is a hugely talented author. Her books have broken new ground in fantasy. She merges the old PI/detective style with an extremely well constructed universe that includes werewolves, vampires, witches, and an assortment of formerly ""oh its only just fantasy"" characters. This new recipe makes magic delightfully real, occasionally funny, and always exciting. She has used her universe to explore different genres of writing - from the aforementioned PI/dective novel to gothic romance. Unfortunately, with her latest book, she has lost her sense of fun. In Obsidian Butterfly, perhaps she was trying to merge the psychological thriller genre into her recipe. Nice try. Doesn't work. The wry sense of humor present in the characters is not there in the way it has been in the past. The characters take themselves much too seriously. This book tries to do too much. Where has all of the fun gone Ms. Hamilton?"
3,"An okay read, but had some problems...","This was an okay read, but the least enjoyable in the series so far for me. The plot was too slow-paced and repetitive. It plodded along without adding much to the characters or overall theme of the series. I did enjoy learning more about Edward and seeing him become more human, but other than that, there was no character insight or growth. There were also quite a few editing mistakes (Dolph's name was misspelled as Dolf a couple of times, the time she spent away from Richard and J-C varied from six months to a year, and a few other things here and there). And finally, I missed the secondary characters this time around (Richard, J-C, the weres, the vampires, etc.) I hope the next book in the series is better."
3,Did high school dropouts edit this book?,"Laurel is Laurel in that her writing is still captivating and fast-paced. What drags the book down is the absence of a good, quality editor. In addition to Anita to ramble too much about her emotions and her thoughts, there were a lot of loose ends left in the book. What happened to Nicky Baco's creation? What happened to the werewolves who were a part of that creation? I'm pretty sure that if a good editor caught these lapses, Laurell could have tightened up her book a lot more and the end product would have been of higher quality.Those editors messed up big time - I hope they get fired for the mess they made (or at the very least, don't work on the next book)."
3,"The last decent one in the series, so far.","After this book, Anita's life basically turns into a porno with small helpings of plot in between sex scenes. I'm not some prude who hates reading about sex, but after this book, the erotica is laid on so thick that the story is made secondary by it.I liked Anita in the beginning. A vampire hunter, struggling with her morality and with who she truly is... She's gone through a lot of changes, but for the most part, they've flowed naturally into her personality. After this book, that REALLY changes.So, if you want to start the Anita Blake series, but want to stop before it becomes tacky porn wrapped in some truly ridiculous character changes, start reading it at the beginning, and stop after ""Obsidian Butterfly.""This book even has some ridiculous neo-Anita moments to it, but the story is mostly about Edward, so it doesn't feel as overwhelming. Edward is an excellent character, so it's worth reading this book just for him. :)"
3,"A few peeves, but overall a fun read--in paperback","I loved the chance to learn more about Edward, but I, too was bothered by LKH's rather exploitational approach to the nursery scene. And *continuity*, YIKES! What happened to Monstruo, the creature in the bar? I re-read the final chapters twice to make sure I hadn't missed it, but no, Anita didn't make a quick side trip before she left town to wrap up that loose end. Sloppy editing, folks. And finally, an obsidian blade is *sharper* than steel, not duller."
4,"Allright, I guess","I've read all of the other books in the series and I loved them. Edward has always been one of my favorite characters, chiefly because he is on the other side of absurd. Anita is a great chick, but her attitude is starting to get old and dated like a Clint Eastwood film. Another thing that bugged me was the way that Anita sometimes sounded like she came out of the ""Friends"" set. I really couldn't swallow that. A girl with how many kills under her belt is not going to sound like Rachel or Monica. Apart from that, the book was full of the usual mystery thriller like the other ones. Despite it being all about Edward, it wasn't as good as the first three books in the series."
4,Why buy the paperback?,"I have OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY in hard cover, so why buy the paperback? Simple. In the back lies an eight-page ""sneak peek"" into NARCISSUS IN CHAINS, the next entry in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series. Rumor now has it that Ace will not be releasing NC until October 2001. Watch http://www.penguinputnam.com/clubppi/ for more about NC and upcoming repackaged reissues of GUILTY PLEASURES and THE LAUGHING CORPSE. No relation to PP/Ace."
5,EXCELLENT!,"These books are wonderful! I'm on the 10th one right now and they just keep getting better! Most authors start to dissipate when they do a long series like this one, but there's always something new and exciting in each book she writes that will keep you turning the pages and begging for the next one. You never know what she'll come up with. It's amazing! Laurell K. Hamilton is my new favorite author."
5,the best in the series,"After reading her other works, this one has the least sex scenes and is the best book in the series."
3,Edwardfest,"This was o.k., but not my favorite Laurel K. book. Edward's home life wasn't as cool as I had hoped, I missed the spicy trio action, and it didn't seem to have the same intensity that I associate with the rest of her writing. Ah well. She hasn't made me jump ship yet like Robert Jordan's last book did. I will still pick up the next in the series. However, I really wish she would write a sequel to Night Seer!"
3,Just Ok. Could have had more impact if it were shorter,"I'm normally a great fan of the Anita Blake books but ""Obsidian Buttrerfly is just Ok. Oddly, the story setup is very interesting and a lot of the scenes are great but the Edward character (the stone cold assassin type) that has been a peripheral character in other books is a much larger presence in this one. The author spends way, way too much time on interplay/scenes between Anita and Edward that are nearly word for word duplicates of each other talking about how ""dead"" each of the characters eyes are and how they'd like to hunt each other just to see ""whose best"". If it weren't repeated so much it wouldn't have bothered me but removing half of the redundancy would have made the story a lot tighter and the book 40 pages shorter.Similar repetitiveness invades Anita's scenes with other characters. Otherwise, if that won't bother you, there is a lot to interest the regular Anita Blake series reader."
2,Boring,"I've been a fan of the series. It's nothing highbrow by any means, but usually an enjoyable adventure. This episode is just too filled with our heroine worrying about whether she's more of a monster than Edward. She's also way too full of bluster and bravado.And by the way to the author -- no one in their right mind would carry the Browning High Power these days. Anita should carry something with more capacity and less bulk."
4,Super Reader,"This is a welcome change from all the weres*x angst and the vamps*x angst from the previous couple of books. You can easily point out the reason for this, too. Edward. Yep, Edward is back, so some monster hunting is to be done.She travels to New Mexico to look at the goings on at a club there."
5,Edward!,"Honestly, this is my favorite of all the Anita Blake books. In my humble opinion, Edward is a brilliant, mysterious character, and his appearance in early books always made the story better overall. Edward, in my mind, is the best and most interesting of all the men populating Anita's world (and its also nice for her to have a complicated, non-sexual relationship with someone). So what could be better than a book that gives us loads and loads of Edward? I love it."
4,A new fan for a great series,"Obsidian Butterfly is the Anita Blake book that got me started on the rest of the series, and I found it highly entertaining and a quick read. The world that is created in the pages is fascinating, and a little scary. At the same time, it is highly complex and very enjoyable. Though each book CAN be read independently of the series, I would recommend starting at the beginning to follow the progression of the relationships with all the characters."
5,Laurel K. Hamilton,I love this book and all of her books. Everytime I get a advertisment for a new book written by this author I have to have it. I can't wait til the book arrives. Her style keeps me wanting more. Her Anita Blake series is the best I have ever read. I was not an advid reader until laurell K . Hamilton came along. There are only two authors I feel this strong about Anne McCaffrey and Laurell K. Hamilton.
4,"Problems and Confusion, but hanging in was worth it","From general editorial errors such as repeated scenes, spelling errors and other problems, to the fact the plot could divided into two seperate but complete plots, it's a long story to follow, but it's woth hanging in there. The whole Edward/Ted Forrester plot was well done and finally gave us a peak behind Edward's cold mask. Inter-mixed with the plotline of the brutal serial murders, that as mentioned before, could have been broken down itno another book, made for a good read, provided you read it slowly, and maybe some scenes more than once to grasp it all.While some complain about the lack of Jean-Claude, Richard and the rest of the gang, I belive that having them beyond her thoughts and the little mention of them 'in person' would have distracted from the main focas of the story. Besides, it balances out with being chocked full of Edward information.Over all, a good book, just read carefully."
3,Obsidian Butterfly,"I really enjoy the Anita Blake books, but in some ways I think that this one was the weakest of the lot. You can see the basic plot in the other reviews but the real problem with the story was that it was very unfocused. It was great to find out more about Edward / Ted, one of the key characters in the series but unfortunately I don't think the book did justice to keeping up with both characters.I did enjoy the book but to a first time reader I would recommend an earlier book in the series."
4,Yet another HOT winner for this author,When a friend first told me about this author I didn't have a clue what I was getting in to. lol She does a wonderful job of drawing you in and making you feel a part of the story. Well done!
5,Ah-nita,"This book is pulled together well; excitement, love, sex, violence, anguish & pain. A real page turner!"
2,A LITTLE LESS DETAIL ALREADY!!!,I've read some of the other books and loved them but in this one her long-winded (VERRRRRY long-winded) style really works against her. She is investigating a series of horrifying murders/tortures and instead of any investigation of who the victims are she devotes all this tume to discussing how the characters dress. TEDIOUS!!! Better luck next time...
2,Obsidian Butterfly,"This is a gross dark book. OK, I read it, I guess because I've read the others. The living dead loose in an infant nursery, sucking out tiny baby's tummies. Not my idea of a good read. I've also lived in Santa Fe for 30 years and the setting could have been much better done with just a few days research. The names kept bugging me Baco did she want Baca? It was a bunch a little stuff like that. We looked at Edward, but totally left out the boys, too bad..."
3,Not one of my fav anita blake books,"Im a huge anita blake fan, I own and have re read all of the books. I don't even mind that the ending books become all about sex. However, this book was a little hard to get through. Anita being pissy about Edwards's choice of being with someone with kids get annoying. The fact that she was willing to try and kill him over it was worse. The story didn't move as fast as some of the others either. It just wasn't my favorite in the series. If you want to read the whole series then I would say to read it so your not totally lost later on , as you do learn things that keep going through the next 10 books."
3,Short on accuracy,"I generally love the Anita Blake series. Unfortunatly, the accuracy of the area around Albuquerque is fairly faulted. Example: Nobody drives up Lomas Blvd, and looks at the Sangre de Cristo mountains as their foremost thought. The Sangre de Cristos are just a shadow from downtown Albuquerque. What looms in your face is the Sandias. Anyone who has been to Albuquerque would have know that. The editor let through way too many mispellings as well.That being said, it was fun to experience the development of the Edward Character. Fun plot line. I just wish I could get past the inaccuracies."
3,"Ok, Just ok",When I first started reading this series I enjoyed it. But up to this book I started to find Anita very annoying and this book seems to cultivate all her annoying characteristics into one rollercoaster ride. Basically Anita has turned into an overly aggressive teenager with a mine is bigger attitude. Which makes you hope one of the monsters would just eat her and get it over with. The story line is still predictable and the dialog is weak. I'm not sure what happened to the series but I hope the next book is better.
4,Edward has feelings! -shocked & amazed,"I very much enjoyed reading the long awaited ninth book in the Anita Blake series. I'm sure Edward fans like the fact that we explored the ""inner Edward"" in this book, however, as I'm only interested in Edward in the abstract, I really felt that the absence of ""the boys"" was a serious let down...they did make one short ""appearance""..kind of. But I was still left wanting. I know that the next book will have all of the boys we can handle and I look forward to it anxiously. I have mixed feelings over Itzpapolotl(?) I think that there were many holes in her character and place in the story, but it was still a very enjoyable addition to the series. ;-)"
5,The Man they call Death,"This is not the worse book written by LKH, but this is the turning-point in the story line when the main character, Anita Blake begins her downward spiral into sexual depravity. The book overall is good; I enjoyed getting to know the supporting character Edward more in-depth and learning more about his continued relationship with Anita. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys vampire novels, but be wary of the novels that come after this one; they just become one big sex orgy."
1,Bad Romance Novel With Vampires,"I have no idea how anyone could read this all the way through. It's nothing more than a cheap romance novel with a vampire hunter as the main character. The supernatural setting, which is supposed to set this series apart, isn't even highlighted or detailed well! It's just background noise to the silly soap-opera-esque romance plot! This is worse than Anne Rice's Interview With A Vampire! Run away! Run away!"
1,Shattered hopes.,"Tho I liked Edward's story, I was deeply disappointed by the book alltogether. Kept reading in the hope that eventually somewhere Jean Claude will appear. Going through the whole thing, without him was painful.If this is the last book in the series. I feel let down. I feel like a kid on Xmas day finding an empty box under the tree. As much pleasure I got from all the books before this, I expected the same. It is Jean Claude that keeps me enchanted, I'm not as fond of Richard. But evenRichard's presence would have made this book worth reading. I know that readers have no right to demand that the author provide us with what we want to read. But still.I'm sure we all want Jean Claude in the story not just for half a page. The unforgettable scenes from the previous books when he was so beautifully present, so detailed that I could almost touch him. And now a whole entire book without him, waaaaah!"
2,Not for vamp fans,"If you've read the series thus far, you may be disappointed by this book.Anita, ""VAMPIRE HUNTER"" leaves St. Louis to help her mercenary friend, Edward. We learn too much about Edward's real life. ""Death"" was better as a mysterious character. His real life is even sad and disappointing.If you want interaction with regular characters such as Jean Claude and Richard, skip this one.*WARNING: Child torture, abuse and molestation are included."
2,Dropped the ball,"I have read all of the other books in this series and I think this is the one that no one spent anytime looking for errors since they can be found all through the book. I have enjoyed the series and look forward to reading it over again but I think I will skip this book in the future. Read it once, checked out from your local library of course, to keep the flow going but don't go back a second time it just isn't worth it."
2,Not my style,"I hate it when an author insists on telling me what I should think of the characters and events in the book, and describes everything in a way that leaves no room for my imagination. If you are like me, DON'T read this book. The style is boring and lacks any kind of subtlety.Apart from the style, I also found the narrator and heroine rather unlikeable. Her moral dilemmas might be interesting if she wasn't such a judgemental bigot.On the whole, I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Needs an editor,"Very disappointing 9th book in the Anita Blake series. It takes 340 pages before any action happens. The rest of the book is 2% action and 98% soap opera. It's very predictable and feels like the series is running out of fuel. At 585 pages, this novel should have a lot more story. Hamilton stretches out each scene in painstaking detail. Unfortunately, this is not one of her better books. Yes, we learn more about the interesting Edward character, but Anita is so boring (even her choice of clothes is horrendous), you just don't care anymore. This book needs to be more edgy and dark, not like a TV movie-of-the-week."
3,"Edward, the homicidal hero!","The most innovative character in Laurell K. Hamilton's novels is easily Edward. In her previous books she had only provided enough information to wet our appetites about this intriguing charater who is as brutal as the monsters themselves.Finally a book dedicated to this unsung hero! Readers not familiar with the first eight books of the series will, however, find little interest in this latest installment. Edward is however brilliant, almost enough to overlook the reptitive neurosis of Anita.The story does lack depth without the vital characters of Richard and Jean-Claude. Edward's starring role doesn't divert the reader from the tedious repetition of this predictable plot. Average story, but being a huge Edward fan, I was quite happy to read it in one sitting!"
1,overwrought excess,"unbelievable in the true sense of the word, my god this is OVERWROUGHT EXCESS and the last of this series I will read"
1,A disappointing effort,"I find it very hard for me to not recommend this book, but I am starting to find these stories repetitive. The ending to this book is too pat and seemed to be a let down after all the build up. Ms. Hamilton's stereotypes of law enforcement have gotten old and tired and she never seems to change. It's time for her to break out of the tried and true pattern she's been using for these books and step out in a new direction. Hopefully future installments of the Anita Blake series will break new ground."
3,Obsidian Butterfly,"Warning to Laurell Hamilton Fans...there is absolutely NO mention of Jean-Claude or Richard in this book! I actually bought this book in hardcover (which I never do) in order to read this edition as soon as possible. I was shocked and crushed when I couldn't find even a little mention of the juicy love triangle. This book seems like it comes from a totally different angle than all the other stories - I think the very different look of the cover tells it all. Evidently, it is a digression to flesh out the character of ""Edward"". To me...it was better left a mystery. It really seemed like an attempt to draw out the book series rather than a continuation of the plot. Don't get me wrong...I will snatch up the next volume as soon as my hot little hands can grab it. But, I wanted to warn my fellow fans so that they might not be as sadly disappointed as I was - WAIT for the paperback for sure!"
3,"I am ""so not"" happy with this one","As a dedicated Anita Blake fan, I was terribly disappointed with the latest chapter in the life of our favorite necromancer. It seems that Obsidian Butterfly was rushed to print without proof-reading. The frequent errors were distracting from the story, which needed some help too. Anita's constant use of the sophmoric phrase ""so not"", was very tiring. I noticed another customer reviewer recommended readers check-out the Stepanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich. I whole heartedly agree. If you like Anita Blake, you owe yourself an adventure with Stephanie Plum. Of course, my disappointment in Obsidian Butterfly doesn't mean I'm not anxious for the next book in the series; I just won't rush to buy it in hardcover."
1,Not good!,"I really thought this book had promise. I liked the character of Edward in Hamilton's previous books, but ""Obsidian Butterfly"" made him look like a wimp! Giving the guy a ""family"" and a ""personal life"" after having him spend years as a cold and calculating hitman was so not the right thing to do. Why didn't Hamilton have Anita fall in love with him, too? After all, she's got lovers from a variety of different species! I couldn't even finish this book; it was so disappointing.Another serious problem I have with the Anita Blake series is the lack of vampire hunting, as listed on the front of each novel: An Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Novel. It's quite the misnomer these days. I wish Hamilton had stuck with Jean Claude (my favorite character) and created more scenarios around him and other vampires. I probably will not by any more of her books unless they feature Jean Claude and/or actual vampire hunting."
4,obbutterfly,"I enjoyed this book very much. The writing has improved greatly as I've read the series. I love Anita Blake and I really love John Claude and Richard. I could never pick between the two, although I do have a thing for vampires. I also like Ted/Edward. He has that cold blooded personality, but underneath he realizes he misses closeness. I need her to write a new book, soon."
4,"Anita Blake has ""bite""!","This is the first Anita Blake novel I've read, but based on the recommendation of a co-worker, I dove into ""Obsidian Butterfly.""What a ride! Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake is a tough, vulnerable, and engaging character. The writing is an enjoyable combination of hard-boiled noirish prose, action and horror.As Anita, the ""vampire executioner"" helps her friend Edward hunt a mysterious demon, she begins to ask a lot of questions about the nature of her job (being a killer) and her place in the world.If you like intelligent horror, this book is for you! I'll be reading the rest of the series, and Hamilton's new Meredith Gentry novel as well!"
3,indecisive plot strategy still sews interesting tale,"This was my first exposure to the work of Laurell Hamilton, and I really enjoyed her style of writing[her sentence construction/phrases].However, I found myself putting this book aside on numerous occasions because I grew impatient with the endless series of graphic scenes that, while interesting, seemed to diminish the continuity of the plot. I was overwhelmed with spectacle...like a tv movie, broken by an endless series of commercials. By the time I was two-thirds of the way through the book, I was just exhausted and ready to read something else. Nonetheless, her writing is very solid and engaging and I will probably try an earlier installation of this series."
1,Obsidian Butterfly,"Don't get me wrong. I've positively adored Anita Blake since the first book, but I simply couldn't get through this one. I think Hamilton is an excellent writer, but this book is simply too much. First, Edward only really works as a character if we don't know much about him. Once we know about his personal life, his mystique as the hard-edged killer don't stand up anymore. This was not an ""Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter"" book, it was a ""Lets Demask Edward"" book. And Anita did not grow as a person, or so I saw, all she did was have a different cast of men to fall at her feet -- either in death or worship of her beauty/strength/power. The other Blake books are, in my opinion, as close to perfection as any writer can get, but Hamilton seems to keep simply wanting to go more and more grandiose with villians and gross with victims, and this was simply going too far. The book did not further the series at all. It kept it at exactly the same spot."
2,Why did you have to do that,"Unfortunately, as much as I love the AB series, I think the series has ran its course. This book killed it for me. For a while now, I have watched as my Puritan fell from grace becoming the sex craved monster who gives only side pseudo-consideration to the high ideals that were the cornerstones of her existance. The development of the characters to become more than one dimensional took away from the power that there archtype presented. I watched, in horror, as both Richard and Jean Clauda lost there beauty. But I draw a line when the iron man get a heart. Edward was my favorite character and to destroy him was to destroy the series' integrity."
1,Some lines should not be crossed,"After reading every previous Anita Blake novel, I looked forward to this one. I have been growing concerned about the amount of needless sex for several novels and had high hopes for this one since it focused on Edward instead of ""the boys"".Instead of taking the effort to creatively write a new, ""more evil villian"", LKH instead choose to include villians who rape and torture children. A graphic child rape scene is a poor excuse for lack of ability.I have returned the book and will not ever purchase another book by LKH."
3,I don't think this book was really necessary to the plot of the series,"I need to say I skipped most of the pages. I liked the idea of knowing Edward more. It was very interesting. But, Anita is becoming quite repetitive and without the other two leader characters in the book she is not a strong enough character to make the book interesting.I think she needs more conflicts that are different than the ones she keeps circulating and repeating in all the books."
3,A five star story. 1 star editing.,"This was a great story which fits in quite well with the continuing development of Anita Blake. A story which I would easily have given 5 stars too had the loose ends been tied up. As much as I want the next book as soon as possible, I would rather wait a few extra months and get a great LKH story without the loose ends that left me feeling unsatisfied."
1,A mediocre thriller,"Hamilton reminds me of Frank Herbert which, unfortunately, is not a compliment. Like Herbert, her imagination outstrips her abilities as a writer. I really like the world she describes but her writing is tedious at best. I slogged through all 596 pages and cannot for the life of me understand why anyone reads these novels. Like Sue Grafton's detective fiction, this is lowest common denominator genre fiction of the particularly uninspired variety."
3,Time to get off the train,"LKH I have loved this series but after reading Obsidian Butterfly, I have to take a very long break from Anita. The constant treat of rape and the sexual abuse of EVERYONE, in every single book is getting very tiresome. The majority of female authors I have read eventually throw rape or the threat of rape into their book series and as disappointed as this makes me in my fellow women, I endured it with your book cause it seemed well placed in the story line......but now you have ridden the rape train for too long and it is time to get off and start writing about something else, anything else. To use a time honored cliché STOP BEATING THE DEAD HORSE!!!!"
3,Edward turns into ordinary Joe Shmo,"While still very entertaining, as all of her other books have been, I have to admit to being a little disappointed at the transformation of Edward from mysterious, cold, and creepy assassin into explainable, emotional, Joe Shmo."
3,Didn't enjoy as much as the previous ones,"I started at Guilty Pleasures and read all and enjoyed them til...Obsidian Butterfly. Wasn't terrible, but just seems to be getting lost here. Finished Obsidian and went on to Narcissus in Chains and stopped early on there. All the Anita Blake books up til Obsidian Butterfly, definitely recommend..."
5,I'm a fan...,"As with the other books in the series I of course enjoyed this one, you're either a fan of this series or you're not, you either get it or you don't and for those of us who do this was another great addition."
2,Obsidian Butterfly,I just did not find this to be as interesting as her other books. It actually took me longer to read then her others so far. I do hope the rest in the series will improve.
5,Unforgetable,"I was so immersed in this book, I did not want to be disturbed.It was difficult to put it down to things like, go to work, eat,and forget sleep. It was just what I have come to crave from the Anita Blake series."
1,"Would be ok for kids, not for adults","About 90% of the stuff in there was stuff I already knew. It might be good for kids, but if you really like to learn new trivia and are an adult this is not a good buy."
5,Vagrant Story,Vagrant story is an rpg with selected paths. You get to build and customize weapons... which I love! Over all great game.
3,It's an ok RPG,I bought this game about 3 months ago with very high expectations and excitement for the game I loved the grphics and storyline I saw.But after playing the game for about 3 days I got bored. I personally think the game is to slow moving and the storyline just drags on and on with no change in it. The charachter Ash seems to stay in a dungeon which I think should have been more designed for exploring and attrbute building than being a main storyline area.The weapon and magic sytem design is way to complicated to be any fun to use esp. if you are a first time rpg'er and you play this game.So all in all I personally think I wasted my money and time with this game but thats my own opinion and I will stick with my FF games and other rpgs.
2,Boring,"I 'm not one of those people who think that if a game has the name Squaresoft on it, it's a good game. While Squaresoft does make a lot of great games, they also manage to churn out some pretty boring ones, too, like both Saga Frontier games and this one. The graphics are ok, nothing special. The colors suck, pretty much the whole game consists of different shades of gray, black, and brown. The battle system is also not much fun. I don't know, it just didn't interest me. It's a good thing I only rented it. I suggest you do the same before you buy."
2,I've rented this twice now and both times its been (bad),"okay the graphics are stunning and about as good as the humble ps1 is going to get but I've got quite a few criticisms of this game so here goes:1) Its hard to know what you're supposed to be doing half of the time so a lot of the gameplay is spent running around doing nothing.2) The combat is ok, but it can be VERY annoying a lot of the time due to the 'affinities' of weapons and the 'risk' system.3) Weapons and affinities are a good idea, but the way they are implemented is dreadful. I found it infuriating.4) The weapon creation system is appaling and it is almost impossible to find a combination that does anything. And when it does there is no way of checking so it ends up just as a (bad) time wasting issue.5) The story is okay but its hard to get a feel for the characters and get involved with the story as in mgs and ff games.Overall, I wouldn't buy this game(...)."
1,"True RPG Fans, prepare to be disappointed","The Characters in Vagrant Story are amazingly developed - Sydney(the villan) is probably one of the coolest bad guys since Sephiroth. But be Warned - You will spend the entire game following him around through the same dark and danky dungeon fighting extremly annoying little monsters. There is only one town, Lea Monde, and you only see it (and the light of day) a handful of times throughout the game. I was very thankful for Electronic Boutique's 10 day return policy - because after about 6 days I was ready to throw the CD's out the window. I respect it for it's interesting spiritual/political storyline ... but Vagrant Story hardly stands up to it's SQUARE predecessors, in summary - A waste of time and money."
3,Eh,I dont know about this one. I didn't really enjoy it too much. The beginnings got to catch me for me to continue and it just wasn't doing it for me.
3,hmmm,"I played it and it was ok. Yeah the fighting was good. (think parasite eve). But i guess its just me. It gets boring staying in a dungeon for the whole game.(25-30 hours). I like people interaction. Going to towns and cities with lush colorful environments. I just didn't like the atmosphere and the feel. If your ok with that, then the game is a blast. But I wasn't ok with it. If your like me, there is better stuff out there like legend of mana or or saga frontier 2. But like i said this is a great game if you can get over the dull atmosphere."
5,"I like it, I like it a lot","As far as I know, Squaresoft has yet to come out with a bad game. When I bought this game I didn't really know what to expect. I knew it had a different fighting system, but that can mean lots of things. I have trouble putting the controller down when I play this game. It is extremely fun. The story line is good, the graphics are great, and the battle system isn't incredibly complex. I highly recommend this game to any hardcore gamer."
5,An overall great game,"I am only 3-4 hours into the game, yet I was instantly hooked. The cut-scenes are just spectacular and blend very well into the normal gameplay. The only complaint that I have is that the battle system is a little confusing at first. Took me a while to figure out that you could string along attack chains into awesome combo's or defense chains into strong defensive ploys. But, it has to be the coolest feature of this game.If you are looking for a traditional RPG, this isn't it. This is a truly different aspect of the RPG genre, but I welcome it to stay. Can't wait for more games like this to come out in the future."
3,Atmospherically beautiful...but slightly lacking...,"Storyline-wise..this game is very atmospheric and at many times, dark. I enjoyed the story and atmosphere highly, but the game seems to stretch on and on into dungeons that highly resemble the previous ones, thus making it very monotonous. The weapons configuration also is very lacking, there are many weapons and other equipment, but it really gets on your nerves and many times, is quite lame. The difficulty level, while hard, is actually very good, although I find myself constantly battling to defeat bosses, and the whole risk facto system is constantly getting on my nerves. If the developers cranked out some of the faults in this games system this would have potential to be a very great game. However, this game would be a good investment for an RPG if you are able to look past its faults. But otherwise, I would suggest 'Final Fantasy Tactics' which is made by the same developer..."
3,Good Game get's Boring,OPVerall this game is good although im only 7 hours into the game but you stayin the same place all the time. Im a big fan of the ff series 5-8 and thought this would have been better. This game is like Granstream Saga with parasite eve and a liittle rpg involved. if you liked those games you will like this.
2,Difficult,I never got to far playing this game. Up to the first save and after that I'm stuck and can't proceed in the game. So I really didn't like this game.
1,Shame on Square Soft!,"I can't believe Square Soft put out a game with game play and a storyline as lame as Vagrant Story. The battle commands are unwieldy and time-consuming, and the dialog balloons are rather childish and distracting. Granted, some of the effects and characters are neat, but I have to say the best thing about this game was the opening sequence. After that, it's a disappointment for experienced gamers. I played the game for about three hours until I couldn't stand it anymore, thinking I would get used to it, but I just didn't like it."
5,legend of the dragoon,i played it it is the most exellent game i have played I like shana she is cool. and awesome I think darts cool.
4,"I wouldn't call it perfect , but no way ""BORING""","Unless your mind isn't able to grasp a game that takes more than 'button a,b,c,d and 'R' this or that... This game could never be called boring. It is, however, complex, challenging, and requires more thought than you usual shoot 'em up rpg.Ofcourse This review is opinion. Take it as such. Games like Diablo (I & II), Soul Reaver (yadda yadda), and The like do necessitate more thought. Now to jump down off my soap box, I, end my review with this: I enjoyed it, try it for yourself bfore formng an opinion from this or any other rev. ..."
1,Vagrant Story is not one to buy,"I give my props for coming up with an excellent villian.(Best one since Sephiroth) The battle is decent since you dont have to wait for a time bar to fill. The worst thing is unlike FF7, is that you stay in one city for the entire game. The graphics are not all that great either. If your one that likes games that you have to go to other cities this isnt for you. I am also very disapointed in the story line. The bosses were way to easy. And anyway the puzzles are kinda lame to.If you like games that have very easy enemies and like staying in one place this is for you."
1,This game is HORRIBLE! Shame on you Square!,"Guys, do yourself and favor and DO NOT get this game.This is what you do....CONSTANTLY running around in a very large and tedious dungeon while pushing boxes, killing bats, solving little puzzles, etc! There is absolutely no fun in this game. You are in the SAME dungeon practically the whole game.How is this an rpg???? It ISNT!Wheres the exploration? Your in the same place all the time.Wheres the variety? Same monsters, same areas, same same same!The only good thing about this game is the cool scene at the beginning of the game, and thats it!Please Please, by all means do not buy this game. You will maybe play it for an hour or two and never play it again. Trust me"
1,What is this???,"awful. Absolutely awful. I am 13 and spent 2 months allowace on this .... the game looks great and the characters move smoothly, until you find out there are about 40 different character animations. This means that ashley does the same thing while attacking. He attempts to stab a 40 foot tall golem with a sledgehammer. Pathetic excuse of a story: play for two hours having no Idea what you're doing, and some nameless character comes up and tells you what happened. ultra repetitive gameplay: run in a dungeon and kill stuff. wwwwweeee. 'nuff said there. The programmers decided to leave out character customization. Want to be a mage? too bad, computer says to be a fighter. don't bother. I have more fun in math class."
2,Piece of gaming Trash,"There are some items that you buy that you feel that you wasted your money on. I've been playing the Final Fantasy games since I was 7 and I pretty much know what a good RPG game should be. In this game you assume the position of Asley, a bum with no plot of a convincible life. The story makes you feel that you're playing this to see the CG movies or fight. The enemies in this aren't even that cool and the animation is choppy. You just see the same attack move every time. Even in FF8 you got used to the characters in about 12 hours but, man, the characters are ... you just love to hate!! I would recommend Final Fantasy 7 and 8, Dragon Warrior, Teletubbies over this game. I feel like I wasted my money off of a Final Fantasy RPG stereotypical clone. If you want a good RPG or gaming experience, do not buy this unless you want to feel the great feeling that you've wasted your wallet's hide again and again for sapless RPGs."
5,Great storage for the ipaq.,"This is the greatest thing ever invented. I have hours of mp3's and I can even watch windows media videos and mpeg movies(yes, Entire Movies. I can even fit two 1.5 hour movies). What more can you ask for? There is only one concern i have with this, The drive while in operation heats the screen up incredibly, i dont know if that is necesserily bad for the screen because mine after hours of non stop use is working fine."
5,Excellent Product,This product is exactly what I needed. I struggle with high blood pressure and this product contains a variety of nutrients that will help you lower and manage your blood pressure and keep your heart strong. I do notice a difference when I take this product. I highly recommend it.
4,"Strong writing, a good introduction to CP","As a woman with Cerebral Palsy myself, I was very interested in this book. I found it to be well-written, clear, and honest. It demonstrates maturity, and is a good treatment of many facets of life with a disability. In a previous review on this page, however, it was mistakenly assumed that Cerebral Palsy is a disease. Although this is more than understandable, I would like to point out that it is, rather, a condition caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain before, during, or after birth. Diseases are generally progressive, and many can be fatal. Although the mobility level of a child with CP often decreases with maturity (due to growth) CP is neither progressive nor fatal, and a full understanding of both the book and the disability is greatly helped by the knowledge of this."
1,"Sad portrayal of life with cp, lacking positive outlook","Based on the positive reviews I read here, I bought two copies, hoping to give one to a young girl with cp, struggling to cope. I was looking for a positive role model for her, someone with a hopeful outlook, who had developed as a person despite their disability. This book is not that. I will not give it to this girl, or give to other students to read. I found this book a very sad autobiography of a girl's life. It was mostly a chronological listing of her life's events. She only touched on the subject of her emotional struggle with cp, but she gives no advice to others in her shoes, leaving the reader to wonder if she herself has emotionally come to grips with her disability. Not a book of success despite adversity that would serve as a model for others in similar circumstances."
1,Disappointment!,"I am a beginner and I was looking for some supplementary instruction to my classwork. This book was unable to give me much help unless I wanted to paint a picture just as the author paints. There was little color mixing or actual technique explained here, and not much on basic brush usage. Perhaps this was meant for a more experienced painter. It has little to offer us beginners."
5,Gained knowledge from the first page on,I appreciate the complexity of nature and the way this book relates to the observing and using your inner feelings to paint. Thank you for such a good book to paint from and use often.
3,Nice book,When I got the book I thought it would be more on Michael Collins . Despite this I thought it was a good book that help put into to prespective the events and people around him.
2,Disappointing and sloppy biography,"Of the several biographies I have read of the life of Michael Collins, this one does not stand up. Frought with inaccuracies as to dates, as well as circumstances, O'Connor replaces research with recollection and opinion. There are several other great biographies of this most important Irish figure. Avoid this one."
3,not the best,"Not the best book Ive read on Irelands history. Written more like a history txt book. Dont expect a biography on Collins, unless you want to skip the first half of the book before getting to his area. Rebels was captivating, this was no where close. Good book if you are just starting your irish journey."
2,"Router is good, but wireless card can't connect at 108mbps","The router worked fine. I had plenty of signal everywhere through my house. The problem was that the DWL-G650M card didn't have a 'super G' option available. That meant that I could only connect at 54mbps rather than the full 108mbs. D-lin's support was able to replicate the problem, and after 5 hours on the phone, they didn't have a solution. On the plus side, they did try very hard to help.I ended up returning the card and the router, and buying a the Linksys WRT54GX router and WPC54GX. If you don't care about 108 vs 54, or you have the patience to wait for a firmware upgrade to fix the Super G problem, then you can't go wrong.If you want to take advantage of teh 108mbps, take a look at the Linksys or the Belkin competing products.."
4,Works Great For Me!,"Purchased both the DI-624M & DWL-G650M two days ago. Very easy to set-up and configure. Works like a champ......no problems at all. I'm connected at 108 Mbps using the DWL-G650M card just fine. Perhaps the previous poster didn't not have his router configured for ""Super G with Dynamic or Static"" mode enabled. Also a few bucks cheaper than the equivalent Linksys router. One thing about Linksys' router that bothered me is that no where on the box does it claim any rate of speed, however the part/model has ""54g"" as part of it (suspect) I was specifically shopping for a 108 Mbps throughput for video sharing on my network. I upgraded from Linksys' 1st gen 11b router so this is a major jump for me. BTW my WLAN is made up of wireless-11b/54g, and now the 108 speed. Router responds well with all mixed speeds. Oh yeah, coverage is excellent so far!"
1,Never Worked,"I bought one of these routers, and I was NEVER able to get any of my computers to get an IP address from it while WPA encryption was turned on. It wasn't just the single unit either, I had exactly the same problem with a replacement unit, and between two different laptops, one with an Intel wireless-G card, one with a Broadcom.If you want to use high encryption on your wireless network, forget this box."
2,"Ok, but performance is terrible","I bought this to replace my Linksys BESFR41 cable/dsl router and Linksys WAP11 access point. Mistake! Everything worked fine out of the box, but my WAN performance went down 66%. With Linksys, I had Internet download speeds of 9742Kbps, but with this D-link Di-624M I get 3072Kbps. I can't get it to go any faster. I have switched back and forth between the two to no avail. What is the problem? Does anybody know? I'm wishing I wouldn't have bought it now. Wasted my money."
1,DI-624M is not a mature product. needs further development.,"I purchased this to replace a di-624.I read reviews, that were very negative regarding this product, especially regarding dlink's firmware version 1.2 which makes the router inoperable.I took this with a grain of salt since my expereience with the DI-624 has been excellent. It has a full feature set.Initial setup was easy, but the firmware 1.01 would only allow 2 static ip clients. So, I upgraded the firmware to the 1.2 version from dlink's web site (which allows 8 static ip clients). This firmware rendered the router inoperable. I could not gain access to the router again. So, the other reviewers were right.This router is going back to the store and I will be going back to my trusty di-624.In addition the di-624m get's very hot, this is a big concern."
1,this router performs WORSE than 802.11b/g routers,I bought this router thinking that it would give me extended range over my previous DI-624. Its range is actually even worse. I can't believe they even put this product on the market. Their claim of 8x the range is simply false advertising. Don't waste your time with this. Shame on you D-Link.
4,Great introduction to phenomenology,"i didn't give this book 4 stars because, frankly, i haven't read enough books on phenomenological research to feel confident that this book is a 5. but, despite this being called a philosophy of education book, this is really a primer on Van Manen's brand of phenomenology--phenomenology with a more constructivist bent. the book functions as a great introduction not only to the phenomenological mindset (mainly inspired by gadamer), but also to qualitative inquiry in general.Van Manen writes in an accessible way, making the book ideal for the uninitiated. i would recommend this book to anyone hoping to learn more about phenomenology as an approach to qualitative research."
1,different from ad,"I received different version. At first I ordered 1997 version of the book, but you sent me 1990 version of book (old version). I am so angry, but I don't have much time to ask due to my class. I just used the book. anyway, it was awful experiences..."
1,Complete Misfire,"A film that had some potential - pointing out the foibles of both the Americans and the French - quickly dissolves into a distasteful and annoying stew of one cliche after another - the vulgar and ugly Americans, the arrogant French, the spoiled daughter, etc., with some of the scenes being downright embarrassing. Even the usually reliable Gerard Depardieu may start out with an energetic and engaging performance, but he too soon succumbs to a terrible screen play. How this won both Best Film and Best screenplay at Venice, and how this could be the product of the great French New Wave director Alain Resnais (Hiroshima Mon Amour, Last Year At Marienbad, Providence) are enigmas that will not soon be solved."
3,It's just OK,"I give the unit as OK. Not great, not the worst. It is definitely not the quality you would look for when spending this kind of money for a coffee maker. The unit is easy to use but lack in the quality dept. It makes OK coffee, nothing spectacular, much more watery than I would like it, leaving out the strong brew from the beans it grins (automatically). even setting the grinder from fine to corse didn't make much difference. I am returning the unit because it didn't brew a solid cup of starbucks coffee other than that, the machines works well."
4,Dave Ballou,He's a genuis period. A wonderful player. I haven't heard that much of Dave but I probably will in time (in person) or work with him or sit in etc.
3,He doesn't know What he wants and wastes everyone's time.,Nora Prentiss catches a fly on her windshield. She's no femme fatale but a convenient excuse for someone living a life of quiet desperation This movie is less about the title character than about the man who latches on to her.
3,HP OfficeJet G55 has many good and some bad points,"The Office Jet G55 has some very good points. Installation is fairly easy. The printer produces top quality color graphics. The scanning capabilities are among the best I've found, and I have enjoyed being able to easily enlarge scanned images to selected page sizes. The desktop manager is easy to use.The only serious problem I have with the printer is the speed -- a reason I've avoided inkjets in the past. The printer is useful for small jobs if moderate-to-high quality output is needed. Large, high-quality color jobs require a multi-hour commitment."
4,HP OfficeJet G55,"This is an excellent product for home use, the color and detail on copies,printouts,and enlargements is exceptional."
1,Not Macintosh compatible,"I had heard all of these great things about HP and I decided to give one of their multifunctionals a chance. If you own a Macintosh and you read their little specifications page and it tells you that these are Mac compatible don't you believe it. I got the darned thing home, installed the available software and the HP. The thing wouldn't work and as I continued to experiment with it I found that it didn't have any drivers. I checked on HP's website and they admit that they do not offer technical support for Macintosh, nor do they offer drivers. Unfortunately this information is quite well hidden, since I failed to find it when I was researching their product. Avoid it and buy a Brother, I did."
1,Mac users BEWARE!!!,"Macintosh users! This is NOT the printer for you. Constant communications problems. Don't even try to use it with an iBook or PowerBook. Every time your computer sleeps or the USB is unplugged, or for just any old reason, the printer will lock up your whole system. You can't shut down or restart and your print jobs go no where. I spent HOURS on the phone with technical support until I finally got a technician to admit that the software was bad.If you want a stand alone copier/fax it works great - just don't try to hook it up to your Macintosh!!!"
4,Outdoor Fireplace,"I purchased this product to use outback on my patio. I chose it due to other reviews I've read. What drew me to it was it's small size. The iron stove is of very nice quality, a bit difficult to assemble, however if you know how to put things together you really dont need the instructions. It's small size is attractive and not over powering like some of the taller ones I've seen. The only draw back is the lack of heat it gives off. Apparently it all goes up the chimney. I wanted to be able to sit a distance from it, maybe 5 - 6 feet away but no, we sit right up on it in the evening. I cover it so it does not rust. We like it and sit outside with it's romantic glow."
3,Bigger better deal at Home Depot,"You can get the bigger (21"" x 52"") version of this same chimney at Home Depot for $129. This one looks great but, from what I've read is tiny! The Home Depot version looks the same only bigger."
1,rusts fast,I loved it for the first three weeks. Then the legs fell off as they rusted out before the first month was over. Granted I did not have it covered but rusted out within a month?Do not buy unless you are goig through the hassle of covering.
3,Extremely difficult set up,"Cute once its put together--but that's a real battle. Nothing fit together, pieces were wrong or missing. If you don't want a hassle as far as set up goes, buy another product."
3,leg broke after a month,purchased last Christmas for my son and daughter in law. I just recently asked him how it was working. He said the right leg broke after a month and has had it propped up in the middle of cinder blocks till he can get it welded or replaced. He still uses it for hot dogs though. He lives up north and he and his friends sit around it in the winter months.
3,"Nice Quality, but SMALL SIZE!","Overall, it's a nice little firepit.... emphasis on LITTLE. No normal-sized log will fit into the screened pit, It just barely fits one fake compressed log, or you would have to cut down the firewood you can buy at the store, which is kind of a pain. That being said, if you're not entertaining more than 3 or 4 people, and the weather is agreeable, this will do the trick. I wish I had spent an extra $20-40 and gotten a bigger version."
4,Cute and effective,It's slightly smaller that what I was expecting and takes a little effort to put together but the finished product is cute and effective at holding a contained fire on our windy roof deck.
2,Tiny Toy,"While I think the unit is built ok and looks great it would be nicer if it were life size. The unit is too small. Had to pull out the chainsaw to cut the split wood in half. Otherwise, looks great. They should create it bigger."
2,OMG nothing fits!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I've been at this thing for the last 2 hours and nothing fits.........I'm sure I'll love it after I Mickey Mouse the pieces....what a pain in the [...]!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Small but Convenient,I purchased this firepit for my back deck. It is open on all sides to allow for maximum heat output and the screen helps block the sparks. The door opens easily to insert wood chips or charcoal. The only downfall is that is is smaller than I imagined so I set it up on concrete blocks.
4,Nice Chiminea For The Porch,"We have a 12' x 16' covered back porch open on two sides and this fireplace is perfect. It stands a full 35"" high and is almost entirely made of cast iron which is great for capturing and radiating heat. You'll want to place it in a clear space of at least 18"" x 18"".Warning: the directions are not entirely correct (instructing you to use the shorter bolts where it is obvious you need to use the longer ones) so use a little common sense during assembly. I did have to use a rubber mallet a couple of times to bring the sliding portion of the cage into alignment and you may want to have a socket wrench handy to handle tightening to bolts.The firepit is only 9"" wide at the deepest portion and widens to about 12"" at the lip so be careful about the size of the ceramic logs you order for this (a 15"" log is going to be too big).We're using a Real Flame 13oz Gel Fuel can with lava rocks and small ceramic fire logs and this is a great combination for ambiance and warmth."
1,Don't buy,Loved it when we first got it. It looked great on our patio. Unfortunately the legs rusted and broke off. Not worth the few months we got out of it.
2,fell apart,"This broke really easily within the first wind storm. Alot of the screws were missing when i first recieved it , the only reason why i didnt return it, was because i had the same size screws that were needed"
4,Pretty authentic,"As a three-time cancer survivor myself, I have to say that the feelings and thoughts, the sense of urgency, the eventual acceptance expressed by this character are pretty authentic. Of course, being Hollywood, what she does about those feelings and thoughts is sometimes more outrageous than what most people would do, but that's part of the fun, isn't it? Really enjoyed all three seasons of this show. You might sometimes show some episodes to children, but probably not all of them. There's some brief nudity and some adult situations, so be sure to preview first."
4,Can't wait to see what happens!,"I started watching Season One and stopped a little over half way through, when it first came out. It wasn't that I didn't like it, I had other things to watch that I liked better.I started it over again just recently and I downloaded Season Two as soon as I was was done Season One. I watched it straight through and it really was very good. I still think they talk about her boobs too much, but she does have nice boobs.I definitely recommend this series!"
5,laugh & cry with Laura,"I love this series. laura Linney has a real quirky take on life with cancer. Not for kids under 14, though."
2,"Works great, but not without drawbacks","This is amazing technology. The read-out on my Canon S10 indicates that I'll be able to store over 500 photos in high resolution setting on the microdrive. That's great, except for two major problems. One, the drive eats power like there's no tomorrow. I run out of battery power (with the display turned off!) about twice as quickly as a regular compact flash card. I'm not sure I can recharge the battery fast enough to ever get anywhere near 500 pictures taken. Most of the power drain would seem to be related to the second drawback. The drive runs extremely hot, which makes my camera very uncomfortable to hold. Not just warm, but hand-me-a-napkin-to-hold-the-camera-while-I-take-this-picture hot. If you really need the storage capacity, this might be the solution, but you better have plenty of batteries (and a potholder) handy if you plan on taking lots of pictures."
5,Great idea generator for unusual craft,"There are 28 different projects, all with step by step instructions and great photos. Some are so-so but there are a lot of neat items in here: from herb tags to picture frames and jewelry (my favorite section). I ended up using the projects as jumping off points for other things. A good starter book on this unusual medium. I liked it a lot."
5,The fate' s designs !,"The egregious significance of Dino Ciani in the great musical stages was not enough to carve in relief his extraordinary talent and powerful abilities as soloist. It just was question of time for him to become one of the most outstanding Italian pianists ever born. But once more, as it uses to happen the envious fate decided by itself to carry off us and enjoy his sublime art.And here you have a striking evidence of my previous statement!"
4,At last...,"Cave In finally put some of their best songs on a full length album. A reworked Stained Silver and Rubber and Glue (AKA Bigger Riff) make this album worth buying alone. Lift Off sounds about the same, but is a great song nonetheless. The new tracks are great too--Inspire, Joy Opposites, Beautiful son. As for a comparison with Jupiter, hmmm....Jupiter=better album, Antenna=better songs, if that makes sense. It's a must have for any Cave In fan."
4,Good modern rock,"It's kind of like later incubus or earlier radiohead, a little bit more straightforward. Nice thick distorted bass and some catchy songwriting and singing. The only thing, I wish it were more evil. My favorites are 1-3, seafrost, 7, and penny racer. The closer is pretty boring. But these guys are really good live. My favorite cave-in song is ""the calypso"" from tides of tomorrow ep, you should get that too, it's a little less rocking and a little more creative. ""Antenna"" has very appropriate artwork! This bridge is important to everyone that lives in boston..."
3,Consistent and engaging enough to far surpass most radio-friendly rock,"3 1/2Cave-In continued their refinement into a more mainstream audience with Antenna, compacting many of the same melodic qualities that made Jupiter such a cross-over success into smaller chunks. Results are decidedly mixed...many of the band's guitar-driven, personalized sonic assaults remain intact, particularly in the first halves shimmering consistencies. Eventually though, we do end up hearing instrumental prowess sacrificed in the name of competent, more typical songwriting. Too many times I am subjected to listening to a sludgy, quite generic verse in order to hit chorus payoff. To that effect, the band deserves more widespread recognition then they are currently receiving, though fans of the band's prior outings will know they are capable of achieving greater heights."
4,Better than the average,"I write this at a disadvantage, having not had much exposure to this band's previous material. Apparently, ""Antenna"" is quite the departure from Cave In's traditional sound, and from the looks of it, not well received by some. If I had a history with this band, I probably would have been turned off as well by this venture into the land of Foo-Fighters-mass-produced-sell-out-pop, if not for the fact that these guys are really quite good at it.For people who like this kind of thing, ""Antenna"" is a sure fit. Cool changes and great guitar work set the tone for this record, with crisp, melodic vocals reminiscent of TPOH's Moe Berg. The intelligent, pop-rock sensibility of songs like ""Anchor"" and ""Youth Overrided"" ground this album as well-placed high points. While there isn't anything particularly revolutionary about this record, in and of itself it is a solid work, and worth every penny of the used price I paid for it."
3,could have been better,"cave in are a great hard rock band with spacey overtones and talented musicians. the 1st 4 songs are quite impressive with hook laden riffs and clever guitar sounds with cool chord changes and they easily take you where the last album ""Jupiter"" didnt. unfortuatly thats where the party stoped for me. the rest of the album lacks focus in my opinion and just dosent seem to measure up to major label standards or even cave in's standards. a lot of the problem is that cave-in waste a lot of their good songs on short lived EP singles when they are needed on a full lenth. the song 'lift off' from a 2 song EP released last year in my opinion would have fit in perfectly and helped to fill the massive gaps in this record.lets not be too quick to forget these are the same people behind some really brutal metal back around '98. it seems to me cave-in have no loyality to that genre at all. the absense of any metal inkling is disapointing and very much needed."
2,let down,"shallow emotion, [bad] music, looks like cave in is going to be another we used to be unique but now we just want to sell records pop culture hard rock band. shame."
2,ummm,"i just got into cave in. i was expecting hardcore. this is not hardcore. this isnt bad for what it is, but its not hardcore. it dissapointed me."
4,antenna,"i suspect that this album will surprise some old cave-in fans, given their metalcore background.the day i bought this cd, one of the clerks at the record store commented when he saw my selection, ""oh man, i heard the new one is horrible. they sold out big-time and are trying to make money."" the clerks comment sort of pissed me off.true, cave-in are a vastly different band now than when they first started. remember all of those references towards the new cave-in as being progressive? well there you have it. real progression. too few bands these days actually progress. you cant really pin down progressive rock anymore. these days, its all relative to a given band.antenna is really an excellent album. its far better and much more relevant than anything you will hear on tv or radio. distinguishable vocals, harmony, melody, excellent songwriting. this all makes for a modern rock phenomena. i must recommend antenna to all rock fans, modern and classic.this is true prog."
5,Don't mess with Valdez,"Sheriff Jerry Valdez is a friendly, easygoing, Tex-Mexeating, family man, well liked in Kendall County, tuckedaway in the picturesque Texas Hill Country. If you're afriend of Jerry's, you will be a friend for life, but ifyou forget what a friend he is and try to one up him, orsnow him with your fancy education, you will find out fastenough who you're dealing with. There's more to Jerry thanmeets the eye.If you kill one of his deputies, and threaten his family,the full measure of Sheriff Valdez is sure to rise beforeyou. It will not long be he who is threatened, but you whomust Run, Run ... If Valdez lacks any talent to bring youdown, he has friends to fill in the gaps, so that justicewill prevail, one way or the other.The action in this short novel takes off like a rocket andproceeds cojones out to an interesting conclusion. It waslots of fun to read."
1,has a turn off,I don't like it. Most of the ladies are fine. But one of them works out and she flexes her muscles on the DVD. That's pretty gross if you ask me. And I don't like the music in it.
5,Action and Suspense,"Inspired by the 1998 ""Titanic"", this is the story of the mysterious sinking of Titanic's Sister Ship Britannic. Starring Amanda Ryan, and featuring John Rhys-Davies (Salah in the Indiana Jones films), the cast is surprisingly good in the way only mid-level British actors can be, turning in workmanlike performances that nearly make you forget this is not a big-budget blockbuster. If you liked Titanic, then see this movie."
4,An entertaining story on the demise of the Britannic,"""Britannic"" is well worth watching. The pace keeps moving swiftly, and the action is compelling. The acting is impressive, especially that of Edward Atterton. Atterton plays a German spy on the ship. His mission is to either take control of the vessel or sink it. With a skillful performance, he causes the viewer to really believe that he will accomplish his mission at all costs. But in the end, he is only doing his duty. As for the movie's other qualities, the computer graphics appear cartoonish at first, but they end up adding creative and helpful scenes to the storyline. For example, the aerial shot of the German submarine's torpedoes heading towards the Britannic is quite stunning. All in all, an entertaining story speculating on the demise of the Britannic. Enjoy."
2,Not enough facts.,"The special effects on the HMHS Britannic sinking is the whole of this movie. The plot on the made for Hollywood about spies, and govenment plot is made up. The movie should have stuck with real events not a made up plot. It is a movie that makes one think whay did they bother. The HMHS Britannic, (Titanic's younger sister) deserved better. She struck an underwater mine in the Greek Kea Channel. Luckily loss of life was a minimal 33, or 35. Ship great --- movie lame"
2,More Drama than Documentary,"As an historian of Titanic and her sisters, I was disappointed that the film did not take a scientific approach, answering some old questions and raising new ones. I always like to learn something I don't already know, and this film had nothing new to offer unless you consider the fictionalized story, which gives the film a nice tv-movie feel. This one would never have made it at the box office. If you know nothing about the Britannic, or just like an interesting tale of adventure/disaster at sea, then this is worth a look. If, however, you prefer solid documentraies with top-notch research and original thinking, this film will be a disappointment."
1,Who sunk the script?,What a waste of film stock. I have not heard lines like these since the demise of Ed Wood. The computer graphics were good but the minatures used at the end were laughable. Will only interest those who are attracted by bright colors.
5,Great call,"Got this call after going on a hunt and putting my old call down on wet grass. The old call wouldnt work wet which pretty much ruined my hunt. Got Wet Willy a few days later, poured water all over it, couple of days before my next hunt, just to test it out. This call worked great wet and dry, once i found the sweet spots. Called in a couple of big thunder chickens into bow range and dropped them."
5,Never built a small boat before ? This is THE book.,"Boatbuilding for Beginners and Beyond is exactly what it says it is, complete with free plans for six boats and enough knowledge to not only get started but finish your chosen project.Jim's construction methods are both simple and practical using readily available materials and a minimum of tools. If you have always dreamt of building a boat but baulked at the complexity or the price then this is the book for you."
3,so so,"It was a decent read, but the boats they had weren't really what I was looking for. They had more listed in the back but you had to buy those plans, it only came with 6 boat plans. The Mayfly, a 14' sailboat, the Piragua, a 13' canoe, two versions of the 13' QT Skiff, one a rowboat and the other a motorboat, a 16' Jonsboat and the Robote, a 14' rowboat.Personally, I decided to just buy plans from one of the many websites on the internet."
5,Happy to have this book.,Everything that has been said about this book is true. It's not a book that you will just use once and never pick-up again.
4,BUILT IT,I'm not much of a wood worker...never built a boat...but I built the 16' jonboat with my 9 year old son helping out. Sturdy. The plans take a little deciphering and could definitely be clearer or laid out in a grid so doing/converting measurements to the plywood would be a lot easier. This is a good entry point. You don't need experience and only minimal tools. Instead of building in the wood seats I used igloo boat coolers that serve as seats and coolers all in one. Added fishing rod holders out of pvc pipe. One consideration when building a 16' boat - I only lived a couple of blocks from a launch but otherwise have a trailer or BIG truck bed. Have fun.
5,SO VERY INTERESTING,I LOVED THIS STORY AS IT WAS A CONTINUATION OF THE OTHER BOOKS IN THIS STORY THAT SARA DONATI HAS WRITTEN.
5,great read!,this is the best book in the wilderness series!!! A must read for historical fiction lovers. You won't be able to put it down.
5,great!!!!!!!!!!,"Fast service, description great, wonderful book. Thanks!!!!!! I always go to Amazon for hard tofind books and always find what I need....."
5,Kept me wondering...,"Queen of swords kept me wondering what will happen next. I really enjoyed Ben & Hannah together. It gave the story a bit of spice. A good history war of 1812, most of the story matches the war according to some books i have read. great book and i just started The Endless Forest."
5,Brilliant,I love this series. It began as a sort of romance but Sara Donati's writing style has become very vivid and exciting. I am a big Diana Gabaldon fan and they are most definitely in the same vein. I was thrilled when this latest installment came out and it did NOT dissapoint. You can smell the streets of New Orleans! Keep 'em comin' Sara!
2,Not the same,"I loved the first four books, but this one flies by without even simple characterization. Their thoughts and feelings are glanced over, and motivations are neglected. It just doesn't make sense.If I didn't already love these characters, I wouldn't even bother."
4,A great entry in the Wilderness series,"I am a big fan of Donati's ""Into the Wilderness"" series, and early-American historical fiction in general. This is an excellent entry in the genre, and a very strong book in the series. My favorite is still the first novel, which primarily featured the characters of Nathaniel and Elizabeth, but this is a very worthy companion and stands well on its own. Hannah is a particularly strong character, and I look forward to finding out how all their stories end in the sixth (and final) book. Although it started a bit slowly and took me a while to get into it, I flew through the second half in just a few days. Recommended, very well written and an enjoyable novel."
5,Love it!,"Loved this lastest installment in the series. It's a different setting than the previous books, and is Hannah's, Jennet's and Luke's story. Some people have disliked the book because of that and the change in setting, but it didn't bother me at all. There's no Elizabeth or Curiosity, though we see them mentioned through letters and memories. Nathaniel and Bears make a big appearance about three quarters of the way through the book, which I enjoyed. It was nice to get more insight into Hannah's past (after her marriage, but before her return home) and to see her be able to move past it to happiness again. Looking forward to the next book!"
5,This book should be a children's classic!,"With this book, Joan Aiken has written another wonderful children's book. I personally think this book should be considered a children's classic - it has all the right stuff. It consists of short stories that center on 2 children, whose mother wished (while she had a wishing stone on her finger) that her children should always have an interesting life - but only one day of the week. These wonderful, whimsical stories range from being about the children's ghost governess, to the day that their house is turned into a school for warlocks (and this while their father is a ladybug!). Joan Aiken's wonderful writing makes this book a must read, for children or older readers."
4,Runs Small,"These shoes are good for beginners, but they run small. I wear street shoe size 8.5-9, but I own a 9.5 and could not wear any size smaller."
5,Bobby Susser Makes This World A Better Place,"Because this world gets smaller day by day, and more people from so many different places live side by side more than ever before, it's so important for all of us to understand each other, get along with one another, and make this world a better place. These things should be taught at an early age as it is done so wonderfully on this CD. Through different themes, rhythms, exciting performances, and activities for these songs, Bobby Susser successfully brings all young children together. I am a teacher of young children, and I am a parent of young children. I want to say, whenever children hear and sing these songs, the world becomes a little better."
5,It's Superb,"Through these easy to learn, catchy songs with various styles, children learn teamwork, the benefits of being nice and helping each other, and even though we are different in many ways, we all have common threads that connect us to one another. Thus, the first song on the album, ""I Am Not So Different"", which all the kids sing and understand. This multicultural album consistently connects with my early childhood students. It's absolutely superb."
5,This CD Is A Contribution To Children,"I work with classes of children ages 3 to 7 and incorporate a variety of methods to promote multicultural concepts. Whichever method I may be using, at its completion I play this CD. This CD captures the essence and true feelings of children, their feelings toward multicultural groups, and helps them realize the positives in working together and accepting all groups, and that we all have something to offer. The songs and their different, but interesting styles that the children can easily sing and understand are wonderful. Here again, Bobby Susser shows that he is a true communicator and contributor to children's healthy growth. Wouldn't it be nice if we all took some time out and sang "" I Am Not So Different"", and ""When We're All Standing Together"". That is, after we got finished with ""Dear Mr. President""."
5,Bobby Susser's CD Is Very Together,"The songs, feelings, and entire creation of this CD truly make the children in the day care centers that I coordinate, far better together. And what's more, is that they have come to know it, as they sing the songs and participate in the activities. They seem moved by every song and absolutely love standing side by side, holding hands, and singing ""When We're All Standing Together"". I love it too. Bobby Susser's CD is very together."
4,Memoir of a Paratrooper,"This book follows Burgett's career in the paratroops as a sequel to his first two books where he relates the stories of the D-Day and Operation Market Garden landings. In ""Seven Roads"" Burgett relates his personal experiences as his unit is called up from a rest area to be thrown into Bastonge ahead of the on-coming German Army in what would be called the Battle of the Bulge. The author is an above-average writer who manages to balance first person experiences with overviews of the battle. Recommended for the military reader."
3,not bad,Good story. Felt drawn out. Could have done a better job in making the reader more familiar with his closest friends I think that would have added more feeling to the book
4,A personal account of the Battle of the Bulge.,"If you want a definitive account of the Battle of the Bulge, this is not the book for you. Burgett's account is a personal view of what his unit went through. In this account, one views the destruction and killing of war. Friends of Don's are killed in these battles and a soldier's reaction is to continue and survive. One wonders how soldiers continued in this environment. I read Burgett's first book Currahee, and found that this book was much more entertaining and true. No outlandish tales as in his first book."
5,Seven Roads to Hell by donald r. burgett,"this book is amazingly interesting. i dont usually read ofter but this book was hard to put down. I loved this work. it is a story of donald and his regiment surrounded in bastogne fighting back to the safety of their lines. their convoy is attacked by a hefty chunk of artillery fire and german ambushes. it also speaks of heavy shelling during all hours of the night by 35 panzer divisions. ""seven roads to hell"" tells how he loses friends in a battle in the woods. i hope you enjoy it!"
3,Below balance,3 1/2A few genuinely moving tracks amongst a majority of experimental small victories ensures an agreeable release neither necessary or disposable.
1,Not at all what I thought I was getting.,"This book is terribly misnamed. No real connection to scouting, only hear say about Baden-Powell."
4,"A lovely cocktail table book, not a guide","The title led me to think that this book might be a guide to actually living in Portugal. It is nothing of a sort, but rather a beautiful book of pictures of life in Portugal. Lovely to look at, with the usual tending-to-purple travel industry text. If it's a book of very nice photos of Portugal you're looking for you'll enjoy this, but for some solid information about Portugal look elsewhere."
4,A beautiful start,"Not really about living in Portugal, but rather, a nice resource to start deciding where one might want to live or travel in that pretty little country. It contains brief, well written summaries of Portugal's distinctive geographic regions, and is beautifully photographed. A large book for displaying a livingroom coffee table, and a nice read on a rainy day."
5,Great Book!,"This is a perfect book to have on your coffee table. The pictures inside the book are amazing and the information is great too. Just looking through it, you can see the culture of the country. Highly Recommended!"
3,Proper attribution for Dallas reader's review,"Please note that the review posted in 1999 by a Dallas reader is not written by that person, but was taken from my review in Scram magazine. -Kim Cooper, editrix"
4,Strong but very straightforwarad production,"This is an interesting early Russian opera with strong Italian influence (complete with many cabalettas). The singing is uniformly good, if not excellent--but it is also mostly of the stand and deliver type--very little interaction of characters or dramatic staging. Sets are effectively painted in a typical Russian manner. The opera is performed to an empty hall (seen occasionally behind the conductor) so not only is there no applause but there is also a certain lack of tension or excitement in the performance. Still, this is an important addition to the DVD catalog of Russian operas."
4,The performance was excellent; the opera was not,"As one has come to expect from the Bolshoi, this opera was very well performed in a conventional version. Singing was very good as was the orchestra. Costumes and scenery were good, although the staging in places might be considered a bit static. The problem I had with it was that the musical content of the opera did not really justify it's three and a half hour length. There were a number of places where scenes (the ballet at the Polish ball, for example) were so drawn out that I found myself wishing they would end sooner."
4,Glinka-Life for the Tsar,"As the first Russian opera, it isn't bad. I bought it to hear the great bass Nesterenko."
3,Old fashion point of view,Perhaps we will never see in the future (or in the presente time?) this type of presentation
1,Dead and unable to repair after 16 months,"This is by far the worst HP product I have ever purchased. The unit is 16 months old. After re installing a printer dirver the unit made a coffee grinder noise. Error message was that there was a printer catridge jam. Following the instructions to correct the condition had no effect. HP tech support told me that the unit could not be repaired. It worked well when it worked, but didn't last for long. If you purchase this, get a very long service contract."
2,HP & the G85 Blow!,"Stay away from HP. As soon as their poorly designed / constructed machines fail, they'll send you to a bunch of useless ""tech reps"" in India. These guys barely know how to operate a phone, let alone diagnose and fix an all-in-one. HP leverages the cheapest resources to construct and service the products that you purchase. This path may prove profitable in the short term but will bring the company down in the long run."
1,Gave up fixing this one!!!,"Broke twice, the second time I spent $80 and hours on the phone with tech support and hours on the web. I cleaned every part they said needed cleaning, I plugged and unplugged, rebooted, reinstalled. What a piece of junk. Main problem is there is a decoder strip that gets dirty and wont work until it's spotless. After a year the decoder strip is stained to the point that it cannot be cleaned. HP has lousy and expensive service. The ink cartridges leak. Avoid HP printers at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,HP is always a crapshoot,"1. The fax feeder SUCKS. I need to stand there and make sure every sheet feeds and doesn't jam.2. The printer works fine except when you make multiple prints or copies (i.e. more than 1) because the first sheet doesn't get dropped efficiently and actually gets caught in the mechanism as the next sheet is dropped. HORRIBLE. You end up having text at the top of the first sheet that should be on the second etc. Who has the time to babysit their fax/printer/coper???It finally died its final death and I'm glad. Sadly, I will probably buy HP again because of price of a new one ($80) and convenience. There's no way anyone would fix the G85 for $80, at least not in the Bay Area. I will not, however, ever buy an ""all-in-one"" again. That term is just begging for breakdowns. Specialized hardware is best. The one I am buying is intended to serve as an outgoing fax only and the occasional colour printer."
2,"Hardware good, Mac software bad","The hardware looks good and the things I've managed to get it do it did pretty well. But the Mac software is awful and I've yet to get it running effectively after 2 weeks of trying. The software doesn't install properly, doesn't run properly, crashes the computer, gives spurious error messages, and doesn't even uninstall properly. So thanks HP for a nice machine but no thanks for the terrible software."
1,Don't bother,I went through 2 of these machines in less then 1 week. The first one said it had a paper jam the minute I turned it on. When I called the HP support and thold them the error message they said it was an internal problem and would have to be sent in. It hadn't even been used yet. I returned it for a second lemon. The second one just kept spewing out error messages. I again contacted the HP support just to be told this one had memory problems and would have to be sent in to be fixed. That was it for me. I bought a Xerox WorkCentre XK50CX. Works like a dream.
4,"G85 - Dont buy until XP ""complete"" software is available","Bought G85 last month from OfficeMax in Blaine MN. Didn't find out until opened up that it would only partially work with Windows XP (even though I told OfficeMax about my computer and was assured that the G85 would work). HP ""Customer Care"" only provides run around as to when ""complete software solution"" will be available for Windows XP."
4,Great all-in-one machine.,For the extent I have use this machine it has been great. It does excellent black & white/color copies and it is fast. One of the biggest flaw is that there is no speaker phone so you can't hear the dial tone. Other than that it has been a great machine to use!
1,So bad I had to return it,"It works very poorly with USB, Win2000, and virus software - all of which I am using. After spending a week and a half trying to get it to run I finally had to give up even after totally rebuilding my system from scratch.Before you buy it, go look at hp's forums to see if they have solved the problems. I wish I had done that before I purchased it.Too bad, because I have an Office Jet 600 which worked perfectly out of the box for the past 2 years."
1,"IF YOU RUN XP, LEAVE THIS ONE BE!!!","I was so happy when I unpacked this printer. Then I discovered the software cd-rom does not run in XP - AT ALL. It gives an error message of: This software not compatible with Windows 4 or 5. No problem, I thought, just download updated drivers and software and set it up. Ack! You can download new drivers, but to get tag along software HP wants you to buy a new CD-ROM! ... Anyway, HP's ""new"" downloaded drivers do not work with XP on my Compaq Presario. I can use the standard Windows XP drivers for this printer to ""print"", but am unable to use HP's improved print drivers, nor can I access scanning functions. Bottom line: This is probably an OK machine if you are running windows 95 or 98, BUT NOT XP!! P.S. Does not work with Windows 2000 either.I would recommend you do not buy this printer!"
1,XP Compliant Software not available till +/- April 2002,"UPDATE (June 1, 2002): Still no Integrated XP compliant software from HP!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you intend to purchase the G85 and are using Windows XP as your operating system, be aware that full functional software is not available from HP until probably April 2002. The installation instructions that come with the G85 specifically state not to install the CDROM software shipped with the G85, but to use the drivers already contained in Windows XP. The catch is that XP only has LIMITED NOT INTEGRATED drivers for Printing and Scanning. All other features (copy, fax etc) must be accessed form the G85 front panel. Since the software is not available, I am unable to rate the product(1 star is the default). For more info refer to the HP website ..."
4,Imation 4mm tape does the job,We have older equipment in our manufacturing facility and some of them still use this tape for data storage. I am glad we are still able to buy them. No issues.
5,is good,"It is very firm and comfortable, feels soft to the touch for low price. I recommend it.no instructions, but it is easy to assemble"
5,Excellent grips!,"Very stylish, comfortable, grippy feel, not too soft, and just the right size to wrap your hand around. Doesn't transfer much of the shock from off-road riding to your hands or wrists. Easy installation with lock-on system.A little pricey, but you only purchase the clamps once and the replacement grips are similar in price to many premium slide-on grips."
1,"If the caps break, the company will ignore you.",I purchased a nearly identical set of ODI grips. The end caps broke. I contacted the company about the issue and they completely ignored me.
5,Just what I needed,"The grips on my mountain bike were standard. For some reason, over time they became sort of sticky. Maybe because I left my bike outside often or maybe the rubber material was disintegrating. At any rate, I read the reviews on these ODI grips, all saying they were legit. Well, they are! They look great, snap on relatively easily, and feel great in your hands. I still leave my bike outside and these grips seem to hold up just fine. The grips are not squishy or wimpy, they feel solid and durable. Would def. buy again."
1,Avoid this book,"Although this book has wonderful pictures of Brazil, it also provides inaccurate information. Historical facts were completly twisted by the authors of this book who reveal extreme ignorance. I was surprised that they had in fact courage to publish a book like this...Don't spend your money here."
4,Good Book!,"I bought a copy for a friend, then another, then ANOTHER, then one for myself, and finally referred it for our faculty devotional group! It has short sections that are good for quick reads, daily devotionals, or chunked reading sections. The tips are applicable and eye-opening. At the end of each section an ""I Will...."" section is included that mimics the current educationanl trend of ""I Can"" statements or learning targets! My only complaint with it is that, at times, it sounds like an email from an administrator--admonishing, quick-your-complaing, get-on-with-it tone. Well worth the purchase price, however. I highly recommend it!"
2,Makes for laboured reading,"Only half of this book contains anything about the TV show, the rest is about other projects the boys have done.If you are more interested in behind-the-scenes and trivia then don't buy this book - there is hardly any. Most of the goodies section is about what happens in each episode, which any fan of the goodies knows anyway.Disappointing."
1,JOKE OF A BOOK,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY... EVERY OTHER PAGE SAYS DON'T NAG IN LARGE PRINT..WHAT A JOKE. IT TOOK ME 30 SECONDS TO READ IT AND 2 SECONDS TO THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE.
5,Best illustrations I have ever seen,"This book doesn't have patterns for full projects but it does show how to do every stitch I've ever heard of. The color illustrations of stitches are very well drawn and easy to follow. All patterns are done in both charted style and narrative. Photos show stitches in solid color and multi color for contrast. Many patterns for rounds, squares, snowflakes, etc. Some are very creative yet use only the simplest stitches.If you have an extra copy of this out-of-print title, please drop me a line!"
1,Cheap plastic connectors,"The ski rack is attached to the Thule bars by a plastic connector which must be spread almost to the breaking point to wrap around the bar. The old 724 had metal connectors. Making them plastic is insane. These connectors will break over time. Additionally, a thief could simple steal your skis by grabbing the rack and twisting it thereby breaking the plastic connectors."
1,Riding Companion from Hell,"I bought this book excited to read about a fellow KLR rider undertaking a trip that I've been comtenplating myself. But instead of any insightful look at the people or places along the way, what we're left with is a juevenille cursory glance, while most of the book consists of the author looking to score with the ladies.I felt entirely sympathetic with his two riding companions, as countlessly the author performs bone-headed manuevers, over-sleeps, doens't prepare in the least for a trip of this kind, and the guy wonders at the end why he isn't invited to one of their weddings.This was a huge dissapointment, and if you're looking for insightful looks at motorcycle and travel, read The Perfect Vehicle, or Ghost Rider, or Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenence. All great books.Avoid this stinker."
3,"An entertaining read, but not a travel guide","The author describes his journey through the eastern and southeastern portion of the U.S. and on to Mexico, Central and South America with two riding companions he met over the internet. Although the story doesn't really begin until he and his riding partners reach Mexico. His humor stands out throughout the book and his shenannigans with the local woman are quite entertaining. He does dicuss the route and the difficulty at many border crossing along with the problems that arise while travelling south of the border. The sometimes difficult relationships he has riding with two people he doesn't know well and the difference in riding abilities. As I said it's not a travel guide, if you are planning a trip down south, it may give some insight on various questions one may have. A worth while read for any adventure tourers."
2,Poorly written adventure book,"If you're interested in a book more about feelings of a poorly organized motorcycle trip than learning about riding thru the Americas, this one's for you."
1,not informative,"The reader should not expect to learn much about any of the Latin American countries that the author visited. This is a book about what goes on inside a Yankee motorcyclist's head, not about Latin America. The author seems ill-informed about the places he travels, so can say very little about them.One star because it is very well written, very readable."
1,BEWARE WHEN BUYING THIS (EXCELLENT) non-FILM DVD!,"I assumed -- in retrospect, quite foolishly -- that I was purchasing the 1941 DVD film of ""The Sea Wolf,"" starring John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson. What a disappointment when I discovered this was a...BOOK!Five stars for quality of readability (assuming, of course, you actually enjoy reading a novel on a computer screen -- I do not!)...zero stars for Amazon for not having stated with absolute clarity that this product was a book -- NOT A FILM!And a dunce cap for me for having allowed wishful thinking to get the better of me by my failing to realize at once that there was no listing below the words ""Sea Wolf"" of the main character actors associated with the film (as is normally the case with DVDs).(A dispiriting sense of inertia prevents me from trudging two blocks to the post office to return this product.)"
4,The One That Got Away,"As Ella's Biographer, I do not really believe as many others do that this is one of her best efforts. When Ella tackled sophisticated Broadway material, as opposed to tin pan alley pop, she needed a strong hand to help with her interpretations. She doesn't really get one here. I spoke with Marty Paich before his untimely death, and he did not remember being a part of this album at all. If Paich was the man in charge, why did they re-do ""If I Were A Bell"" from their previous album in 1958? This album did not do well when originally released, which is why it was never re-released on vinyl or on CD before now. Don't get me wrong: none of Ella's Verve albums are bad, but with Sweet Songs for Swingers, Hello, Dolly!, and Whisper Not still unavailble in the US or imported from Japan, I am curious at the choice of releasing this one now. The best track for my money? ""Hernando's Hideaway"""
3,It would be four stars for any other singer...,"Songs out of context from Broadway musicals were not the best fit for Ella's talents, which is one reason this release was not a big seller in 1962 or since. Yet it certainly doesn't suck. Some of Ella's novelty tunes from the late '30's or early '40's don't hold up for me at all, but her 1950's vocals and song choices are almost all good. On this effort, she mixes novelty tunes and love songs almost equally, and perhaps that combination is one of the (minor) flaws. It is quite listenable, but not quite powerful or memorable. My favorite Fitzgerald release, which I rate even more highly than the famous ""Songbook"" series, is the live ""Ella in Berlin."" That one plays to all her strengths."
4,It helped me in my research.,"When I was diagnosed in Jan 2001, I was given 11 months to live. I did alot of research on alternative treatments. Conventional medicine had pretty much given up on me. One of the items I found was this book. There is alot of practical information on health, and cancer treatments. I would recommend reading it. Just the information on various alternative treatments is well worth it. I have always been impressed with the author's wealth of information."
5,The most informative,The most informative book on alternative cancer treatments that I have ever seen...If you or someone you love has cancer.....You need this book...
5,Wild over Wildblossom!,"Every time I finish one of Cynthia Wright's books I say ""I Love It!""I just finished WILDBLOSSOM and I did indeed love it! What a romp with two of my very favorite characters. Laughed when Shelby had a plan and Geoff went along with it, cried when they were apart, and even gave up a quiet cheer when another character died (twice)! Very clever of Cynthia to sneak Adam Raveneau in there to make me even more anxious for TEMPEST (Coming soon in 2012)."
3,Great Sound,"Installation was fairly easy. The fastest way to remove the exhaust would be with a portable buzzsaw or hacksaw. Sounds great but I have no real way of testing for the alleged power increase. It definitely feels different like it revs more and louder at the lower speeds. I don't think it's necessarily better since before the engine felt more responsive, as far as acceleration, and just as powerful. What I could test for is the fuel ecomony which was also part of the reason I purchased this item. After months of gathering data, I concluded there was no notable change in fuel economy. Therefore, at this point I feel like all this did was change the look and sound of my exhaust. Not worth the price."
1,---gosh aweful......,scratchy---chunky----break neck tempos.... one of the worst recordings of violin music anywhere....in this case hungary
3,Pride finally led to a fall,"Follows Custer's military life from battle to battle from the Civil War to Indian fighter to his gloriously stupid death at Little Big Horn. An inspiring leader who always rode at the front of his troops, he finally led them into the greatest victory ever won by the Sioux. Much is made of his devotion to wife Libbie. Disobeying orders, he once abandoned his regiment to check on her well-being and was suspended without pay for almost a year. Drawings, photos, maps, glossary, bibliography, websites, index, chronology all included"
5,Yet another unsung classic...,"Releases like this that have made me lose all faith in the American music industry. Now don't get me wrong, I mean that in the best way possible. Its just so disheartening to see bands with so much talent like Novembers Doom scorned for stuff like Linkin Park, Staind, Slipknot...etc.I could lament the unjustice of the recording industry all day, but I'll get on with the review. Of Scultured Ivy And Stone Flowers may just be the quintessential Doom album of all time. It encompasses everything a Doom album should be. Sad, brooding, acerbic while still retaining a sense of elegance and a glimmer of hope. This is an album so filled with texture and emotion it takes you to another place. Every element comes together to form a darkly tranquil, profoundly human expierence."
3,Its Not Easy Being Green...,"I would like to start off by saying that this product got to me incredibly quickly, and I was delighted with the shipping and packaging. The pendant is pretty, although the mold used for the pentagram is probably a copy of another mold, as the detail of the runes is quite thick and sloppy.The chain, as mentioned in other reviews, is cheap, but so is the pendant! Both items turn my skin green, so I would recommend buying some clear nail polish and coating the back of the pendant before wearing it. As for the chain... it is pretty much beyond saving. It is thick, masculine, and in my opinion rather ugly. Still, this pendant is not all bad!"
2,mixed feelings.,"I ordered this item a while ago. it got to me in a reasonably timely manner, so I have no complaints about THAT.shipping costs were pretty high.the Pendant itself is GORGEOUS, but the chain is cheap and tacky. I'm going to have to purchase a sterling silver chain that will compliment the Pendant, without turning brown. but I really wanted the Pendant. so I'll get another chain that won't tarnish, but will show it off.actually, they would have been better off to sell the Pendant without a chain."
3,"Beautiful, but Flawed.","The pendant is gorgeous...I couldn't be happier with it. However, the clasp on the chain came to me broken---so I can't wear it until I've replaced the chain. Kind of a bummer. I feel that the broken clasp was something that should have been inspected before it was sent to me. I would still suggest people order this item, because the chain I got probably was a freak occurance...all of the other jewerly I've gotten from this company has been flawless."
5,the reapaer,this is a awsum movie to let the kids watch....... they watch it over and over keeping them in one location so i can get my work done..i have to find more movies this good for the kids
2,Why would you want to buy this?,"I just borrowed this from the library for free and it has absolutely nothing to do with the original theatrical movies which where live action movies and this one looks fake because it actually looks like a computer video game with animation added, nothing original about it and the story is not complete so I can't believe that people wasted tier money at the movie houses to see it, the extras only tell a little about the actual creation of hos the turtles came to be."
2,Pretty miserable,"I really liked the old Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles stuff, but watching this movie was almost painful. The only thing good about it was that I bought it for just a couple of bucks on a black Friday sale."
2,Way to butcher another classic,"It's funny how fast Hollywood pumps out these terrible CGI movies as a way to make a quick buck. But did they have to ruin one of my childhood favorites? I mean, if they want to exploit another movie by over- merchandising a bad story with even more obnoxious celebrity voices, they should've just made Shrek 4. The kids of this generation are getting gypped. Don't watch this movie."
3,Throw a smoke pellet in front of this one,"If anyone is close with Raphael and can snatch a few smoke pellets from him, throw one in front of this new TMNT movie. Chances are, movie-watchers who aren't fans of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles probably won't enjoy this one. Thus, I only recommend this movie to fans of the turtles. Even as a fan of many years, I was somewhat disappointed, but I was entertained regardless.Pros: the animation and visuals are stellar, and there is plenty of action.Cons: the jokes and dialogue are cheesy, and the story isn't exciting."
5,TMNT!,"These guys never go out of style. I loved them when I was a kid, and my kids love them now. Good clean fun. Beware if you have young boys - they may start karate fighting everything in sight after watching this a few times! ;)"
5,Great!,"I just loved this film. I was so nostalgic that I watched it twice both with a big ol smile on my face. Though even if I hadn't been a fan as a child I would have still enjoyed this movie. It has character development, action, comedy, and a collective team orientation- even the foot soldiers joined the turtles to overcome the obstacle. I think its a great film for any age. I am also pleased that they will be another (based on how it ended.) The only thing that as a female bothered me is how they portray females even in animation. In this animation April and the leader of the foot soldiers were both sexy gals with tremendous curves- couldn't we get the average gals with the average physiques (I don't remember April being vuluptous and she def wasn't sexy besides she looks like a Teenager herself in this one and she should be atleast in the mid to late 20's.)"
3,"Painted pet turtles, flushed? Mutated in the sewers","A sequel reuniting the brother turtles against nearlysupernatural/ immortal stone warriors doesn't reallychange the major plot line or introduce any innovationsin character, dialog or outcome?The bad guys die and the good guys go on as usual?Even children get bored with the same old same old..."
5,TMNT,"Just watched TMNT for the first time since theaters, on this awesome Blu-Ray disc. Film looked great. And though it wasn't the full 1080P, the quality of the picture was still quite clear to watch. A great disc."
5,Really Good,My son and I watch this and were surprised at how well they made this movie. It was new to my son and he loved it. I was around when the ninja turtles came out. cough cough.....getting old
4,TMNT Great Animation !,"Great animation movie, you wont be disappointed. But I just wish that if it become a real movie, with real people, it would be a lot more interesting."
5,TMNT ROCKS,I'm very happy i bought this film on HD-DVD. When i saw it in theatres the babies crying kind of hurt the experience. Now i get to see it just as if not more beautifully then when i saw it in the theatre. Great movie as well even for a big kid like me (25)
5,TMNT,A fun bit of fluff to enjoy with the kids. It is a pretty good movie with a lot of humor and family values...on the turtle level.
5,Pleasantly surprised with this film,"This isn't the best TMNT film, but it was also a nice hidden surprise for what I thought was going to be a boring reboot. Excellent cast and picture quality is amazing. But hey why are you still buying HD-DVDs?"
4,Happy with the purchase.,"Product arrived on time at USPS, but USPS didn't give us a notification about its arrival. So it took couple of days until we check online and pick up the item at the local USPS. Happy with the purchase though. Gave 4 star rating due to item in good condition and I'm a turtle fan. Unfortunately, I would have given it additional star if we didn't have to go to the hassle of picking up the item."
1,What Happened to The REAL Turtles?!!!!,This movie & game are a WASTE of time & money!! This has gone so far off the map its not even funny!!! Hasbro once again SCREWS a great name & toyline!! They have done the same to the Transformers! No wonder stores can't sell ANY of the turtle toys!! Hasbro NEVER gets it right! They NEED to FIRE staff that WASN'T born in the 80's if they ever want to see the light of day again!! I HATE Hasbro with a TERRIBLE VENEGENCE!!!
1,The Live-Action Version Was Better,"TMNT was a horrible movie, because it was CGI and not live-action. My advice: buy the classic Ninja Turtles trilogy(live action)on DVD."
4,"Good Story, Great CGI, Outstanding Visuals","A great movie that brings back the turtle nostalgia of the 90's when we were younger. I am no turtle fanatic, just a fan as a kid (and a die hard movie analyst). There is some serious CGI & Visuals in this movie if you know what to look for, some of the best out there. The story is not bad either; I would have liked to see more of Michaelangelo and Donatello. There are some good fighting scenes that are very detailed and visual as well. This movie is very different than the real movies of the 90's. In a way, it is more enjoyable than the real movies, which had a ""poor puppetry"" feel to them (except the first movie). If you have a top end TV (1080p 120hz +), Blu-Ray Player and good cables, you will enjoy the fine detail that went into this Blu-Ray movie. Otherwise, the regular DVD would probably be just as good."

1,"Cheap price, Cheap product",My last blade lasted over 1 year with daily use. I always put in all soft ingredients before ice so the blade doesn't jam. This item lasted around 30 days before stripping out.
4,Good,"Good product, I only wish this product was made of stainless steel, the plastic portion of this blade assembly warps and leaks after a couple of months use. But for the price it's good enough."
2,For Random Browsing Only,"I have been reading about underwater exploration. A ""World Atlas of the Oceans"" sounded like the perfect study companion.I was hoping for a really good, well indexed, collection of maps that covered the entire ocean floor. I was not able to determine how much of the ocean is covered by the included maps.)The lack of an index to the maps makes it difficult to look up and, go to a map of any particular place. The table of contents lists each map by the title of the short essay that accompanies each map. So, if you have not read and recalled the essay you can't know what map you will find. In fact the entire book is a long series of articles and essays about the oceans. Lots of pretty pictures, and titillating, short introductions to interesting subjects. It IS a beautiful book, and a great intro to our underwater world, that is why I gave this book more than one star.A map of the 200 beautiful maps would have made this book actually useful."
2,Atlas Schmatlas,"First let me say that this book has a large number of very pretty 'maps.' If all you're looking for is pretty pictures, this book is for you.That said, I was very dissapointed to find no ancillary information with these maps - projection info, scale, date, data source. All the elements that make a map truly meaninful. Without this information, all these beautiful maps are mearly pictures.I also think it's telling that one of the captions refers to a picture of a squid as a 'giant octopus.' Anyone who has spent more than ten minutes studying the ocean knows the difference between these two animals. This could just be poor editing.Overall, this book was a dissapointment."
2,Atlas Schmatlas,"First let me say that this book has a large number of very pretty 'maps.'

Anyone who has spent more than ten minutes studying the ocean knows the difference between these two animals. This could just be poor editing.Overall, this book was a disappointment."
2,"I want just the facts, 'mam","Why is it that so many scientists aspire to cover 'EVERYTHING?' Why do so many books about the ocean, like this one, also include social messages about 'saving' the oceans and thereby saving the planet?Why can't the authors have the discipline to write about only a few related topics, and cover them well? How about presenting just the facts? And comprehensive maps? And scales? And references that tell me from where and when they got the info?OK so maybe asking for equal coverage, geological information, actual data instead of hand waving might be too much. But how about just balanced information?This book is eye candy. It doesn't cover any of its many topics well. Furthermore, it's got a European bias. You can barely make out the features of the ocean floor surrounding Indonesia, an area with important oceanographic features, we have learned at great cost last Christmas."
1,NOT THE BOOK!,"I was very disappointed to click on this too quickly and discover that I had just paid 5.95 for a very short book review, not a digital copy of the book itself. For the same price, you can buy the book. And there is no way to undo it, apparently, so I'm out the money. RATS!"
4,Great but...,This has to be one of the funniest shows out there. Unfortunately this DVD suffers from having only the first two episodes (23 minutes a piece?) for a retail price of 20 bucks. AND what is the deal with having commercials included in each episode just like we were watching it on TV? Extras? Not. It really comes down to how much you like the show and if your willing to be overcharged. Personally I'll do it because the show is so good. Maybe Tommy Boy should just stick to CD's and leave the DVD's to other competent companies.
3,,This video is less than a 1/2 hour longand has 3 commercial breaks in it with actual commercials.
5,Where's Volume 2 through -- ????,"Kung Faux is great mix of east/west. It's like two great tastes that taste great together. I used to be a big fan of the old kung fu movies, & to see what they're making by mixing them with hip hop music & talent, as well as video game & comic book stylings is awesome.Each major fight scene has well chosen music & great comic book and video game effects & editing to make for something that's a great DVD. I also like the old Batman style ""POW!"" & ""BAM!"" graphics done in the tagger stylee. The eletricity special effect that they add on is also a favorite.I guess my biggest complaint is that there's only 1 DVD available.... They should start selling Season 1 DVDs & start making Season 2.With so many cable channels syndicating the show(AZN TV in US), I'm surprised there's not a Season 2 already.I hope this catches on overseas as it makes a great cultural export :D"
4,Very Funny,"A good watch with friends but they must have a sense of humor and should be knowledgeable of the east coast flava. I enjoyed it although it had gratuitous use of the ""N"" word (as if Oriental people would call each other that but that is part of what makes it funny). Being from the east coast myself it was nice to get back up on the flava and the slang of home. ""Boxcutta style baby, blade it up."" To all who watch it ""enjoy it son""."
1,Boring,"You have to have a shallow mind to enjoy this show. There is no plot, just a bunch of scenes with unfunny words dubbed over. Any entertainment value that existed in the original movies is completely lost. Seeing Kung Fu scenes taken out of context is funny for about 5 seconds.Not to mention that you are buying the equivalent of one TV episode with commercial breaks."
3,Hater aid?,"Kevin G from Cali seems to have taken a big drink of Hater Ade with his review, because although I wish there were more episodes on this dvd and that's the only reason I give it any less than four stars, it still has two of my favorites on it, runs over an hour and long, and has a super fun karaoke game function on it that I hope they never stop including on the rest of the dvds from the series. Dropping a little dough on this dvd to have it forever is a much better deal than coughing up those monthly bills for satellite tv...plus the dvd version is totally uncensored, which to me is way more funny to boot. Buy this and be happy."
4,KUNG FAUX VOLUME 1,THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HIP HOP AND KUNG FU FANS ALIKE.LOTS OF UNDERGROUND VOICE TALENT SURE TO MAKE YOU LAUGH!...
5,works great,very effective and priced economically as well. We've been using these for years and they last a long time too.
3,Buttons Get hit by accident too often,Buttons stick up above surface and get bumped accidentally in purse all the time. They need to be flat or recessed.
5,The Second part of Woody Allen's 2011 documentary,"is as wonderful as part 1. There are more outtakes from his films and more about the mia farrow fiasco which he handles so well.In both part `1 and 2 his sister, 8 years his junior, is a great addition. She is so bubbly and kind and it's all very touching and I recommend highly..."
4,It is all about the manual,"The manual for the 200 in one kit is better in my view. Sure many of the projects are the same and the new ones are good but the humor that was in the 200 in one manual is just not in this one.Still the kit is well though out the projects are worth while and even when you are done with what is in the manual you can continue to use it as a powered breadboard. I recomend this item along with ""Getting Started in Electronics"" by Forrest M. Mims III which you can use with it once you hit the end of the manual.I am currently working as a design engineer. I was given this item back in highschool by my family because I really love the 200 in one kit they gave me in preschool. I still pull the 300 in one out and use it when I want to play with something on a breadboard and my others are full. I used to take it with me as carry on when I used air travel but I have not lately because I don't know how the TSA would like it."
3,This product is somewhat fragile,"I ordered this toy for my 10 year-old son who is willing to take challenges beyond the Elenco's Snap series which are just too basic for him. Initially I found this toy can consumes much more his time and this is what I want. Everything is not that easy to assemble and is very trivial to figure out what component is what. However, I found he cannot make things happen for many projects and I cannot find anything wrong with what he has done. I also repeated his work and it did not work either and we were so frustrated. I bet something not clear in the manual. I also think this product is somewhat fragile! I am a engineering PhD and I found myself difficult to troubleshoot problems so how come I expect kids to enjoy this ""toy"". Instead of a toy I would think this is mini lab for those with some electronic background."
3,Not for a ten year old,"I'm a practicing Software Engineer. I have been for the last 16 years. I get paid a lot of money for my technical expertise. I took some Electrical Engineering courses while I was attending an Ivy League University, but I concentrated mostly on Digital Electronics. I wanted to learn about analog components. That's why I bought this kit, inspite of its rating as a Toy appropriate for 10 year olds.This ""toy"" is appropriate for me. If there is a 10 year old who can make sense of this toy, his name would be Steve Wozniak.The instructions are pretty ambiguous. The easiest projects start somewhere in the middle. The manual is not clear. The plastic from which this kit is made will definitely not stand up to abuse by a normal 10 year old.If you buy this, do not buy it for a 10 year old. That will be money wasted. Also, be sure to read the sheet of errata that comes with the Manual."
2,Do not waste your time nor money on this one !,"Unless you want to spend hours focusing your eyeballs on the labels of tiny resistors, and trying to keep track of them all and then hooking up a circuit that doesn't even work..be my guest !!This ""toy"" was even difficult for (2) adults with masters degrees ( computer science and chemistry ) to figure out. I'm sure there is educational value in there somewhere."
4,"Good, Expected better for the money.",Nice heavy gauge wire built to last. Light cages poorly designed. Need to use Zip Ties to keep them closed.
4,Good for beginners,"[A review of the SECOND EDITION 2004]A favourite scripting language of many programmers. Holzner offers an update to his successful first edition on Perl. Here, he talks about Perl 5.8. As a bonus, he offers informal glimpses of the upcoming Perl 6.If you're not interested in Perl 6 for now, and already know the language, then this book is unnecessary. But if you are new to Perl, the book will be a concise guide. The examples are simple and short. Towards the end are subroutines of moderate complexity. All typically less than 100 lines.One thing to note is that the book doesn't expound on higher levels of structured programming. If you have a problem that might require a Perl solution of say 1000 lines or more, then how to tackle this, and decompose the problem into more amenable parts is not discussed here. This book caters to teaching the syntax and simple applications that rest directly atop this syntax."
5,My Defacto Perl Reference,"As a new programmer and new Perl programmer this is an invaluable reference. For the ambitious newbie this book can serve as a great starter guide to the Perl language. As a reference and supplement to another beginner book, this book really soars.I was able to quickly expand my understanding of Perl and started writing real perl programs (albeit very simple ones as a beginning perl programmer) by using this book. You'll become well versed in Perl using this as your constant guide.When a programming reference can be distilled is such a highly useful and pragmatic way, you've got to add it to your library. Brilliant job on this one.I highly recommend this work and I'm confident you won't leave home without it. Or perhaps you'll buy one for home and work. I also highly recommend 'Perl Power' by John Flynt and 'Beginning Perl, Second Edition' by James Lee (Apress) as companion beginner books to this one."
3,Takes you back over 200 years,"I bought this book because I was hoping it had some words to the Olney Hymns, but there were only four hymns. Many of the other poems were depressing, but some were quite entertaining, such as The Retired Cat.This book of poetry will take you back to another age."
3,"Good thickness, but the fibers are longer than expected","This is a good thickness to keep you warm, however the fibers on this shawl are surprisingly long... on average they go out about 1/2 inch beyond the connecting threads... so it made me feel like you have to maintain the look and pile of this by brushing the fabric with some sort of delicate brush or your fingers and also dry-clean only. I'm sure you'd also have to be fairly careful when wearing this so it does not snag or get tangled too much. That being said though, it does look stunning. I gave this as a gift so I'm not sure how the upkeep has been."
5,Proud Grandmother,My first impression was an outstanding performance of two motivated young people who show a promising future in percussion.
1,Poor Quality,The first one i used broke the first day. The metal clip is very weak. Not worth the shipping to return them.
2,Fun yet Preposterous,"Murder in Mind is quite a ride, but ultimately, it crashes. One can see why Ms. Parker was interested in the role(s). Like The Robber Bride, MiM provided Ms. Parker to play her characters from different perspectives. And I should add, she delivers as does Jimmy Smits. The first hour of the film works successfully in keeping the viewer off balanced and reevaluating. It's a wonderful ride until the last 20 minutes, where for this writer, the film turned into a sinister take on Shaw's Pygmalion. Interesting idea, but the story took such an over the top and preposterous road that it leaves one feeling disappointed, confused and a bit cheated. It was simply too much to swallow.Ms. Parker does a fine job and resists overplaying it, as unfortunately her costar Nigel Hawthorne, failed to do in the end (I expected better from him).Interesting yet with an over the top and wacky ending.Grade: C-"
4,Kinda. Small,The product description didn't list a measurement but all in all I'm satisfied. It's printed on thick paper so it's well made. The size just surprised me. I really like this poster for my classroom.
4,A poster not a toy,The poster came in time. The packaging was quite tight and I had to wrinkle it a bit just to get it out.
2,Great writing . . . but the story isn't very compelling.,"I hate to be a sour puss (in light of the glowing praises for this book), but I have to admit that this book really didn't do it for me. The writing is excellent . . . there's no doubt about that. However, the story wasn't very gripping or compelling. I just didn't feel the need to pick it up every time I saw it on the coffee table.When I read the inside cover, I was left with the impression that all but one sailor survived. I thought this would be an entralling story about the peril of each lost sailor and the triump of the sole survivor. That's not the case. Only one *finished* . . . which is more then I can say about how I did with this book. I stopped reading it 2/3 of the way through. There aren't many books where I'll make a 2/3 investment in time only to skip the end.There are plenty of other great sailing books about racing. ""Close to the Wind"" and ""The Proving Grounds"" were both excellent."
5,A non-sailor's view,"One day I heard a couple of book reviewers on the radio rattle off a list of good books, and I jotted this title down. When I got the book, I was uncertain as to whether I would enjoy it. The only sailing I had ever done was out in SF Bay as a passenger whose assigned job was to stay out of the way.But after reading the book, my view of sailing has changed. This book utterly grabbed me. I couldn't put it down and I relished every word.While the book is a true story, it isn't just a documentary. It is full of stories and portraits of people who are more fantastic than fiction. I think that not knowing anything about the Golden Globe race kept me in greater suspense. This was a page-turner 'til the very end.I applaud Peter Nichols and his writing style. I read Perfect Storm and found it sterile and unemotional. This book was just the opposite. It was invigorating, enriching and human."
4,How does your life look? HAH!,"I Loved this book! I confess, it has been several years since I read it (desperately seeking!), and have only recently learned that there was also a movie, _Pigeons_. I saw myself in this book while our hero pissed away the only things (especially wimmin) which could help him. Sound familiar? This book, in its place, will throw you in your place, and you'll love to be there. What does your life look like now? Look at it through these eyes."
1,A sad excuse for a book on angels,"This book contains several serious errors.The most obvious error is that the student is taught to invoke ""Samael"" for Mars, but however, kabbalists have taught for centuries that Samael is the Prince of the Dark Forces. Anyone foolish enough to invoke Samael will basically not be doing themselves any good.Also, I have found that several of the talismans contain flaws in them, which means that they cannot (ever) possibly work!"
2,Argos,"Having studied with various Western Esoteric schools, I found David's book easy to work with and understand, it took me to a level where I finally understood some practical aspects that had previously eluded me. I was impressed enough to enroll with his group and take several of his courses over a few years.Whereas I found the experience useful, it was limited in that as with most magical authors/practitioners, the focus is on the technique, without an explanation as to why it may work.Without a clear understanding of how the multiverse/matrix works, we are still bonded to the old medieval idea of needing magic, and few magicians have gone past being stuck in their `system'.Books such as Tom Campbell's `Theory Of Everything' trilogy, Laura Knight's `Secret History', or the books on Gnosis by B Mouravieff have helped me towards a state of understanding that make the use of Magic seem a limiting factor rather than the empowering tool I once thought it may be.Worth reading, but move on."
5,excellent book!,"for those who are interested in the practice of magic, this is a helpful book especially for beginners though the system (steps) included here is not for novices. it's a simple guide to enochian magic and qabalah. the instructions in the book covers love, health, prosperity & personal well-being.. same with how to communicate with the angels. you won't regret buying this book!"
2,This Bachmann product does require glue,"While some Bachmann structures can be assembled without the use of modeling glue, this one is not one of those, so if you are an individual who also lacks storage space for assembled buildings, you will want to pass on this item.The particular product that I received on the day of writing this review was also partially defective as the support visible in the center of the picture for the loading platform was too large for its slot. While I possibly could have trimmed it to fit with an Exacto Knife, I can't say I would trust myself to do a good job of it. As such, I have sent the product back for a gift card."
3,alright,for some reason the alternator whines but good over all will update if i figure out the whining prblem any advice will be greatly appreciated
3,Easy install,"I had no trouble installing this adapter; however, my documentation is a copy and sometimes incorrect.Look elsewhere if you don't like playing with settings or if you must rely soley on the written instructions. Otherwise, it works."
1,"Wasted money on beamless ""Smart Beam""","I purchased the Smart Beam about a month ago and have not yet succeeded in transferring any data whatsoever between my two laptops and two desktops. They make it sound as simple to use as the builtin infrared ports but the truth is that there's plenty that needs to be configured and you had better have the knowledge and expertise of an advanced computer user to succeed. I am very disappointed and consider the Smart Beam to be a waste of money spent and also feel slightly mislead by the manufacturer as to the simplicity of the product. And, I'm considerably above average in personal computer technology but don't have the time needed to devote to configuring the Smart Beam although, some day I'll take the time and might give an update."
3,Search for options,The racket is heavy and it is more expensive as the one you get from Target. Also the racket in target is lighter that this one.But still a ok deal.
5,Window Shopper,"I bought this recently and already I think this racquet is great. The main reason I bought this is because this is light and oversized, great for beginners like me (plus this racquet isn't so expensive). But I think this racquet is good any level player. Highly recommend it!!"
4,Satisfied for the price I paid ..Grip could have been better,good one for the price I paid .. Grip of the handle could have been better
4,nice racket for a beginner,"it is a nice racket for a beginner, but the handle is not very comfortable to use- it tends to slide in your hand"
2,"It's colorful, pleasant, but not very informative","The video falls short in archaeology, basic biblical studies, and ancient Israelite history. One does not need to buy into the 'formal criticism' school entirely to find some value in taking the topic seriously. Instead, the viewer is presented with the Cecil B. DeMille school of theology; that the Almighty dictated the Pentatuch to Moses. It was not very satisfying from an academic standpoint."
1,Not compatible with all printers,"This product, and other in it's class, tend to imply they work with all printers when in fact they work with only a small set. Read the fine print and make sure your printer is supported!"
3,3epeat,"3 1/2Neither earth shattering or groundbreaking, but a practical, consistent trio of well textured, minimal-minded early ep's nonetheless."
1,Poor Quality,The hinges broke after a couple weeks. I had to just go out and buy a new toilet seat to replace this one when I was done. It is cheaper and less hassle to just buy a hinged toilet seat.
4,young environmentalists in training,"I used this book as part of a unit when I was student teaching and the children were enraptured with the theme of preservation. Perfect for the classroom setting, but don't underestimate the joy it'll bring the frog-lover in your family."
3,Problems booting,The LaCie (note the name is French) drive works well as a secondary drive but I have to make sure it is turned off or my computer won't boot. Once the system is up I turn on the unit and it is recognized in seconds. Am using Win XP Home - Service Pack 2 on an IBM think Centre desk unit.I spend many hours trying to re-configure my machine to to boot with the drive on. No luck. I use it for backing up files
1,Died After 2 Months,"I am very disappointed with this drive. It worked great for the first two weeks. After that, it started disconnecting for no reason. Annoying, but not a major problem. Rebooting the drive or the computer (Dell w/XP) solved the problem. Until today. Now the drive is dead in the water. I've tried several times to bring it back without any luck. If I can't figure out something I'll be out a hundred bucks and all my backup files! I strongly suggest avoiding this drive if you care at all about the data you'll be storing on it."
5,Reliable,"I bought this drive as a portable backup mechanism after major computer problems caused a Dell meltdown in 2004. The unit has worked fine for me on a Linux Mandriva system, protecting and backing up all my documents. It provides a great backup solution.Just turn on the unit, and it is up and running on my system. It is completely removable and can be stored in another location for safe keeping."
3,Good,"I bought this since I need more space in my hard disk. It said, 80 GB but you only got 76 GB. It is not the best, but a good one and portable size. It works well in my wind xp."
5,LaCie 80GB External Hard Drive,"Worked as advertised. The only issue I had was to make sure the harddrive file systems on the main drive matched the LaCie. Windows XP uses NTFS and the LaCie came with FTS. The first back-up failed when the LaCie tried to take a file in excess of 4MB (NTFS handles up to 10 MB). Reformated the LaCie to NTFS and ... no more problems. Quite, and fast."
1,Lasted 3 months,"I bought this drive for backups. Worked great first couple of weeks; backups performing automatically as expected. Then errors started cropping up: drive not formatted for windows - reboot would clear....then it just stopped registerring as existing altogether. It just sits on my desk; I don't move it around. Pretty disapointing product. I see the reviews are mixed here, but they're generally bad everywhere else. I completely regret the purchase."
1,This does nothing for me,"It been awhile since I've done this many eye rolls. Where to begin? A celebrity heroine trying to escape the trapping of fame but moving to some small town in Texas to work for some Billionaire who apparently can only hire one person to run his children foundation. ??? Nothing about this whole story seems credible. Including women admitting on an exit interview how they originally took the job to marry their boss. What?? And the hero talks like a female. ""What do you mean the women have designs on me?""What man says DESIGNS?I hated that everything was told to me as oppose to me seeing things. Like how the hero and heroine met. I was told in past tense what took place when they both saw each other as oppose being there when one or the other walked in and witnessing the response. The mirror that shows his destiny and all that--it was just hookey. I'll steer clear from this author in the future."
5,Wee Little Bit Of Awesome,"Just got mine in the mail yesterday. Carry it around with me for good luck. It's very adorable, and quite delightful. All of my friends think I'm absolutely insane for carrying a garden gnome around with me, but psh to them, I'm in love with the little guy."
3,Decent multiplayer fighter for the Wii,"The interest in playtime will vary from person to person. I personally bought it because at the time it was only $10, and I needed games for my wii. I didn't play it too much. I tried the story mode out. They use Dialogue with voice over instead of cutscene animation, but I don't find that problematic. I came to a wall in the story though when I had an objective where they told me to perform a move I didn't know what was. I had bought this game used also, so there was no booklet. I could've looked it up, but it wasn't that serious. I just stopped playing. Most people, it won't interest too much if you're not a fan of the anime, but its a great kids game. No blood, lots of action."
4,Na-ru-TO!,"This game was a lot of fun. Although it is easy to pickup and play, it takes a lot of mastery to be able to fight the AI on the most difficult settings. Co-op play is a blast and again, you will need to learn your character's combos, and their special moves in order to keep up.After a while, the game gets old because most matches turn into a ""replacement jutsu"" contest where it all depends onusing the move to escape your opponents' combos.It gets frustrating on high AI levels because you know that you will NEVER get a combo in, the AI will always break your attacks using the teleportation attack."
2,Lack lack lack...,"I wouldn't recommend, you can get all of the characters in less than hour. Plus, all you need to do to win a match is press up and the strong attack. Do not buy."
4,Good game,"Good game for fun, do not expect a masterpiece. Conforms to have a good time, especially fans of the serie."
3,It's ok...,"I got this game for my boyfriend who is an avid Naruto fan. He enjoys the Japanese version of the series and wished this game were in the Japanese style. Also, we haven't been able to figure out how to play with 2 players on the Wii... it's been really daunting trying to figure out the 2 player mode! But besides those two quirks, my boyfriend is still enjoying the game."
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought this game for my 13 year old son. It didn't take long before he was complaining about the game controls being difficult to get used to. He said the graphics were horrible, and the fighting was boring. The story was unoriginal and lacked the stuff he would have liked to have seen. The part that disappointed me as a parent was the fact he spent his hard earned allowance on a game he beat in 1 1/2 hours.I don't usually write reviews, but I felt it was necessary this time because the reviews on this game indicated 4 1/2 stars. That rating influenced our decision to buy this game. We don't plan on buying Naruto games in the future."
1,Boring Beyond Belief,"While I know disembowelment, evisceration, torture and excrement are all the rage in the gay studies departments of our ivy league schools, this is just poor writing.I was not shocked at all by this, I was bored and had to force myself to finish it.Plot:1) all teenage boys are gay, have anal sex in abandoned buildings, and love murder2) George Miles is so beautiful that he cannot be described.3) he lives with his mom and dad but is an enigma (?)4) he gets serial murdered by a killer-friend's killer-friendThe end (of the book and of my interest in Cooper)"
4,Cooper is covering some familiar ground,"I've just finished this book, my third so far by Dennis Cooper, the other two being ""Frisk"" and ""Guide"". Cooper seems to be covering the same issues of sadomaschoism, death, murder, homosexual rape, etc...In this book as compared to the other two the reader can see his development as a writer,which in the later books he is more controlled in his prose. This was one of his first books, while the other two were written later. It's a good novel with some similar characters but it left me with a coldness inside."
4,Old-school Cooper,"I always promise myself that Dennis Cooper will not be able to shock me again; yet, he somehow manages to do so. For most readers, the majority of this book -start to finish- will be quite shocking, especially to those unfamiliar with Cooper's work. I was appropriately mortified along the way, but it wasn't until near the end, in the last chapter, when I was genuinely surprised and disgusted. The story is about a boy, George, who bounces from lover to lover, being used to fulfill others' needs. Even the ""love"" that he finds in the end is getting his rocks off on the side, and this, beyond any scatological or blood play, is what disgusted me most."
1,"Lots of breadth, but extremely poorly written","The good part is that the book covers a wide range of topics in the area of mass transfer. The pity is that the author nearly always has assumed that the person has had instructions in the subject before approaching the topic. In the interest of being pithy, the logic behind the phase diagrams and equations is severly lacking in several chapters. Bottom line: it is good book if you are a practicing chemical engineer who is already familiar with the subject, but pathetic as an introductory text. Stay away unless it is forced on you by the class instructor."
3,"Sad, slow, humble...","Tadeo was a famous photographer who turns into a street magician after a haunting accident involving his child hood friend. He learns of a life altering illness which forces him to look back and inward about his relationships, his regrets and his mistakes - and he tries to make amends before he dies.This is a low budget film that is slow moving and sad however I enjoyed the sweetness and humbleness in Tadeo's relationships with his neighbor, his blind assistant, his ex-wife and his friends."
3,"Well-written characters, slooooow pace","First time author Lowen Clausen has skillfully drawn characters that are sympathetic and quite real. First Avenue is Clausen's first book, and the former Seattle police officer places much of the story on First Avenue and around Pike's Market.The storyline accurately emphasizes the low-key relationships that a beat cop will establish with the everyday citizens, both the good and the bad, who inhabit his territory.Clausen is a good writer and the story has the rich detail that only a real cop could put into a crime story. On the other hand, the story is just too low key. For sure, most police yarns have action that is far over the top, but in First Avenue, Clausen has gone the other way. In the end, the book is a well-written, ultra slow paced yawner."
4,A Police Story And A Good Read,"Author Lowen Clausen debuts in a police story reminicsent of Joseph Walbaugh's ""The Blue Knight."" Emphasis here is on character developement more than on the plot about catching the bad guys. Clausen makes you care about the people in the story and he is an new and original voice in the police-mystery-action genre. This is a good book that holds your attention but I couldn't help feeling that Clausen is going to get even better the next time out. I'm glad I read this book and you will be too."
3,"didn' live up to what part 1 vrought to the table, but don't worry, it gets much better in part 3.","This one was really slow, but they did do a recap of what had happened in part 1, last time on ninja death, that would have made the movie for me if they would have said that. Part one was very emotional, but part 2 is just too slow all around, BUT A MUST WATCH TO SEE PART 3."
4,Pleasant,"True Colors is a great emotionally driven novel. It can be frustrating to watch Meredith and Cy believe the worst about each other when they obviously love each other, but it is easy to understand their motivations. At first, I thought Cy was a bit too harsh, but as the novel progresses, you get more insight into his personality and you see his tender side. This book is engaging and full of romantic tension. The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because I grew bored of the sections that focused on the business aspect of Meredith and Cy's relationship and of all the scenes involving Cy's mother. Overall, this is an enjoyable read."
2,Poorly done,"I like DP, but this was a major disappointment. Sometimes I think it's just my mood when reading, but not this time. Literally forced myself to finish this book. That's why it got 2** -- it was one that I could finish!"
2,My first Palmer Book,"Ok, didn't know what to think. Didn't read the reviews first, so no biases here....I borrowed this book. It was a good book, but I would have to agree that maybe too far fetched, things got repeated quite a bit, kinda like the reader was ignorant, but at times I laughed out loud and others brought tears, but I would definetly say that this is NOT A TERRIBLE book, although, I don't think I will run out and buy this book, maybe I'll borrow another Diane Palmer and give her another try? We'll see"
1,Childish,"I will make this review short and to the point. I thought Fern Michaels' books were childish, which they are, but this author is right up there with her. I have never read a book so full of irritating characters, every last character in this book was annoying, the story was silly and the writing terrible. This book doesn't even deserve 1 star but that was the lowest I could rate it."
2,book club pick,"I was not expecting this from the first reviewers comments. I was expecting a little espionage with drama and light romance. I was extremely disappointed in this alpha male character. I don't think abusive language and possessiveness means I Love You. And if that is what some women think, have at it. But this was not for me. If my book club hadn't picked it, I would never have picked it myself. I don't mind romance, but quick frankly, I haven't read them since I was in high school. And to romanticize this relationship and call it loving is (in my opinion) a joke. And if this writer has other styles of fiction, let me know. Just my thoughts."
1,Hardly made it through,"I am usually the first one to recommend a Diana Palmer book to anyone who asks who my favorite author is, but there is no way I can recommend this one! I usually and read a D.P. book from beginning to end in one sitting, but it took me a week to get thru this one... almost quit, but was hoping it would get better.. never did."
5,not available elsewhere,Was glad to find this book as it was not available from my other sources (e.g. karen's books); was a gift and the recipient is delighted
2,It's driving me crazy!,"I had this album back in 1982. After Buckner & Garcia had a hit with their novelty song ""Pac-Man Fever"", they recorded an entire album of novelty songs about video games. The songs were silly, of course, but mostly enjoyable (to my teenage brain, at least). This CD features re-recorded versions of all the songs on the album. I can't tell you how close these versions are to the original versions, since I haven't heard the original album in over 20 years. But if you want the Pac-Man Fever album on CD, I guess this is better than nothing."
2,It's just NOT the same!,"I thought that when I got the new release of this classic that I could re-listen to the songs that had me jamming growing up - what a freakin' DISAPPOINTMENT! I went to listen to ""Goin' Berzerk"", and the sounds were NOT what I remember. I KNOW what Berzerk sounds like, and I'm sorry, but those voices were NOT it! I'm scared to listen to the rest of the album now for fear of having my favorite song memories scarred by a less-than-stellar remake.You can tell by the voices and singing that this was a new CD, but trying to sing the way they used to. The voices are not the same - they're older and a bit deeper.Come on, Buckner & Garcia, get out the GOOD STUFF and reissue it how it was MEANT to be! This is just a sad testament and sell-out just to get some money."
4,holds up well,"I just heard the CD and I'm happy to report it holds up well: the songs are catchy, they're fun and easy to listen to multiple times. Oddly enough, even though they're novelty songs they still sound better than about 80% of the so-called ""serious"" songs out there today."
1,"THE ORIGINAL WAS WAY BETTER, THIS STINKS!!","Well, if you were as excited as I was when I saw the PAC-MAN Fever album was finally on CD, you need to come back to earth. THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL RECORDINGS! They rerecorded it all. My favorite song, ""Do the Donkey Kong"" was trashed. So it's back to playing my old album, which does still sound good. My suggestion is to go look on auction websites and try to find the original recording on LP or Cassette. Of course I won't be selling mine. Unforunatly, CBS records is not releasing the original from 1982 on CD yet, and may never. K-TEL did the new release on CD. Which that's why I'm all that more discouraged. K-Tel did good in the 70's releasing records that are alot like the ""NOW"" CDs. If any questions please contact me at: blackmj@2fssg.usmc.mil."
1,Not worth your time,"I picked this up at a thrift store for a dollar. I just couldn't pass up an album titled ""Pac-Man Fever"". I seriously think I would have gotten more enjoyment out of setting the dollar on fire.I can't adequately describe how bad this album is.To start with, almost every sound on this album is created with a synthesizer. That'd be okay if the music wasn't bland and uninspired. Buckner doesn't even bother with music that plays to the synth's strengths, he creates music that makes the synths shortcomings glaringly obvious. The vocals match the music, and are among the worst I've ever heard. Buckner can't sing, and he's not even singing interesting lyrics.If you're really nostalgic about 80's music and 80's video games, then you might like this; but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Nothing Beats the Original,"If you bought the album when it was originally released and loved it like I did, you will be disappointed in this new version. I loved every inflection, I loved the exact way the instruments were played, and I loved the classic video game sounds. Each song on the album was a masterpiece.Since Buckner and Garcia couldn't get their hands on the original, it's nice that they tried to recreate it, but it's an offense to the ears for people who loved exactly how the original album sounded. Thank God I still have mine!Buy this version to support them. You can always use it as a coaster. Maybe they'll make enough money to buy the original from CBS Records so they can put out the CD we've all been waiting for."
3,"Yes, it's a re-recording","I agree that it's disapointing that the original LP hasn't been reissued -- I imagine Buckner and Garcia wish it would be, too. The fact is, though, for some reason Sony/CBS is sitting on it, so this is the best that we can do. Viewed in that light, I don't think this qualifies as a rip-off. The guys have stuck to 80s style arrangements. There is no attempt to ""update"" the sound. Yes, the vocals are showing some wear, yes there are some variations. But the simple fact is, this thing is still a total gas."
3,Not the original recording!,"When I was a kid this was one of favorite albums (with the whole craze of Pac Man and ATARI). So when I saw this CD was finally released on CD I just had to get a copy.As soon as I hit play on the CD player I could notice right away that something just wasn't right with the first song Pac Man Fever. The CD states that this CD was re-recorded digitally, which is fine, but it has this weird in and out hiss in the high frequencies, like that occur in low bitrate mp3 files.Another problem I have with this CD is that all of the videogame samples they use in each song is not the exact portions that they used in the 80's release.I'm not saying that this CD is horrible,but, I really wanted to relive my childhood by hearing these songs the exact way as I remembered them from the 80's.I guess I'm just a purist."
2,Capture the Sun Saga,"I really wanted to like this book! I love Old West Native American heros. However, I know I wouldn't have read it had I known it was such an emotional rollar coaster. I use reading as an escape and to let my mind have a little brain candy. This book was not that. To be honest, the h/h were happily together for maybe 20 pages of the book? The rest was frustrating and down right depressing at times. The author even had to kill off an innocent woman! Ugh! Now, instead of being relaxed, I'm emotionally exhausted. If your looking for a sweeping saga that has the h/h at odds for 90% of the book, then this is for you."
5,Amazing book,"A must have from Magnum!great quality for a used book, im very satisfied with it.Nice to see football away from the highlights"
1,Anybody want to buy this used?,"I am really interested in the Battle of Britain, and I had the Rowan original (which will not run on Windows XP), so I bought this as soon as it came out. However, a lot of things are still wrong (i.e., aircraft code letters matching the squadron).I recently did the software upgrade from Shockwave to v. 2.05, but all that did was make the game COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE. It would not load, and locked up my machine every time I tried.I've heard the team behind IL2 are coming out with a Battle of Britain sim. I'll be waiting on that...and junking this one."
1,Bad Product Bad Company,"Basically this game was a let down from the day that it came out of its packaging, firstly there was no manual to speak of for UK customers and the game is plauged with so many faults that most of the time you will be playing a slideshow rather than being immeresed in one of the greatest air battles to date. instead you are left with so many crashes that the game will end up dusty on your shelf. It is an old game that has been rehashed but cannot polish a turd, Stick with IL2 Forgotten Battles as the graphics and gameplay are far superior.Too many crashes, Too many Bugs and GMX media have the worst customer service i have ever encountered, DO NOT purchase this title or any GMX games as when you highlight the faults to them you will not be heard and you will also be banned from their forums.STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRUDUCT , as even high end machines find it unplayable!!!"
4,Still developed and best of all,"This sim is still being developed and is, in my opinion, the best of them all. It is not a casual arcade game. It is realistic and difficult as were the real planes it represents. It should be viewed as a hobby rather than a game. The sim has had many years of updates and they are continuing constantly. Try reading the forum of this sim and see if you want to undertake the necessary learning that it will take. You could not learn to fly a WWII fighter easily. Many were killed trying learn to fly them on both sides. This sim is the same way, but you can rise to try again. If you devote the time and effort to mastering it, you will be richly rewarded by an experience that you cannot relive any other way. Just my opinion and based on my experience. I have flown actual F-51, Me109 and other WWII era planes and this is as close as it gets. IF you are looking for a hobby this is it. If you are looking to pass a few casual hours look elsewhere."
1,"I wish there was a ""ZERO STARS"" option!","The only reason I gave this 1 star is because no stars isn't available. Ok, in spite of the reviews that said this game had some programming issues called ""CTD's"" (crashes to desktop) I bought it anyway since one reviewer said it ran fine after downloading the updates. All I can say is that he must be blessed. After downloading all 3 updates (patches) this program will not run more than 1 minute into the game without crashing. There are too many other flight sims available to waste your time, much less your money, on Battle of Britain 2. They should rename it ""$43 bucks down the drain""."
5,Innovation at its finest,"24/7 Innovation is a book that should be owned by everyone in the business industry. It is the best new business book on the market. A must read. After being in the business world for 40 years, I found this book easy reading and pertinent to many aspects of my industry."
2,This is not the next Scarpetta novel!,"This is not the long-awaited next novel in the Kay Scarpetta series! Instead, it is merely a French translation of ""The Last Precinct"". ... I rated this as two stars because most readers of this English-language review are likely to be disappointed by the book, since it is not a new book as they were hoping for. If I had written this review in French I would have given the book 4 stars."
4,Those mysterious Beales,"The reason I bought the book was because it was about the Beale clan. I wanted to see what my fictional family had gotten up to, so I bought the book from Amazon.com as Amazon.co.uk would not sell it to me in Australia. That hurdle being overcome, and having received my copy from America, I found it a very difficult book to put down. The plot was not insignificant, but kept happening right on to the end, and kept me wondering if Wycliffe really had a handle on the crime. Having never read a novel by W.J.Burley before, this book gave me a good introduction into the ability of the Author, and he rates fairly high in good solid criminal mysteries. A good read."
1,Poor Design,The plastic edge of this thing is too high so slight pressure on the sponge pushes it down and all you get is plastic on leather. Took forever to shine up one pair of shoes and had to get rid of it.
2,Kiwi Shine Sponge,i have been using this product for a while but the product I got from amazon did not gave me the same feeling as the sponge was very dry and did not show much effect after rubbing it on my pair of shoes.
5,"Fast, touch up of your shined shoes.",I have used this as a quick touch up to my black dress shoes which I have already polished with kiwi black shoe polish. It works great & looks good! Makes people think I did a lot of work on them. Highly recommend.
5,adorable shoes!,"I got the silver pair and they are much more sparkly than the photo shows. They are very sweet and fit well. The tread bumps on the sole are great. Very cute, comfortable shoes."
3,ok shoe,This shoe makes a nice ad presentation however; once I received the product it didn't make the same impression as it did on the website.
5,ravens rule,My son loves them for his Ravens room cuz he is all about the Ravens just like his daddy all the way
2,There must be better quality for Spartan fans,"My wife bought this for me, because I am a huge Michigan State fan. At first is seemed fine, but it wasn't very long until the ""Spartan"" part of the cover started rubbing off. Once that starts, it gets worse in a hurry and you are left with all this fine black dust. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the mesh part is actually fairly nice."
1,cute but poor quality,When I recieved this bangle is was already bent in two places. It is tooooo thin and not $99.98 worth of gold. I returned it for a refund.
5,The Skyray is an old favorite,"My Skyray arrived well before I expected it to, the package was clean, and unmarked. I would buy here again without reservation. And I've already got two more. I've bought a few models lately mostly units I've already build but about 40 years ago. The box makes a nice poster."
2,A lot of it is filler.,"I got the book and started reading it. The first few chapters tell you nothing about how to kiss. This pissed me off somewhat. In a book I value a brief and to the point sort of approach. I also don't give a damn about celebrities and what they have to say. Or about the world record for longest kiss. Or a chapter long definition about what a kiss is.Seriously, it seems as if Mrs. Edmark had a few good points to make but she needed to meet a page number minimum. She filled all the extra space with captions and titles and other trivial information that does not help with kissing. I haven't finished the book but after reading the first chapter and a half I'm not compelled to keep reading it. My time is more valuable."
2,Is it true?,"I found this book to be a good story, and I believe STORY is a word I use lightly! How do we realy know if the father in this book is telling the whole truth? We don't. I have first hand experience as child who was molested from the age of 6yrs to 9yrs old. My molester was my Uncle! Let me tell you something about the mind of a child molester. First of all they dont believe they are doing anything wrong, so when they swear they didnt do it, they believe it whole heartedly! And they will go to ANY lenghts to get people to believe them! Because if they are found out, their addiction will come to a hault, and they will no longer be able to feed their hunger again! so in all reality, to me , it seems like a sick person trying to grab at any straw he can, to get anyone he can to believe him!"
4,Beautiful prize winner,"This book won one of Canada's most prestigious literary awards. In 1983, it was given the Canada Council Children's Literature Prize... the first poetry book ever to be awarded it. <Ghost Horse> is based on true-life events, which occurred in 1874.A good book to give to a child in whom you want to instill a love of poetry."

4,Facilitation with Ease!,"Excellent resource to work from. Great for self-learning and for picking out examples to teach others who are learning to be good facilitators. Some material can be used for handouts , with citation of course."
1,We owned this Camera,"We owned this Camera, is not worth a Penny, also is been discontinued.If the Rates will been lower than 1 Star, I will have give it ooooo+."
4,"Yeah, this guy's got it","If there are any fans of Loscil, Murcof, or even Autechre reading this, consider Arovane a close relation, both in terms of style and substance.Anyone else think the title ""Atol Scrap"" refers to the leftovers of the Bikini Atoll US nuclear detonations?"
3,Not the clearest picture,"Since I like all kinds of movies, I thought I would pick this up, on the cheap, since cable television used to show these all the time. I was a little disappointed by the DVD print that came my way with these three films, as they are somewhat blurry on all three of the films. I don't think I would by a multi-package of films again, due to the blur factor.Unless you've lived under a rock for the last 20 years, you already know what you are going to get with Jean-Claude, which is not such a bad thing. Cyborg I would probably only watch once, Double Impact & Death Warrant many, many, more times.Van Dammagisty, indeed."
2,bfs hat,"i got this hat for my bf as a gift cuz he was military and he loves wearin his old military hat, i got this for him to match what he wore better and it was a touch too big even after we washed it, a little disappointing"
5,Grate Hat,"Grate hat,good looking,durable,I have a convertible and the hat stays on better than the normal one do,why I think it's because of the adjustable Velcro's in the back.I'll be getting the other colors latter."
3,A great book but a bad ending,"OK, I love Dhamon, Ragh, and everyone in the book, but i was suprised at the ending and the way each character was ""resolved,"" if you can call it that. And the biggedt question on my mind is ""What happened to Feril???!!"" She was Dhamon's love and she just disappeared. There was specultion in Downfall but nothing was ever concrete. I hope, pray, and beg Jean Rabe to give us something that can answer some of my questions and a new book with just a little more of the story."
1,Overpriced,"This is only one 12-pack of coke! When I purchased this it was $25 with free shipping. At that price, and from the product description, I assumed that I was ordering twelve 12-packs. This is not the case. If you are thinking the same thing I did, be aware that you will only receive 12 cans of coca-cola if you order at this outrageous price. I promptly returned my order."
1,why so expensive?,So why is this $25? That's $2.00 a can!Do these have some kind of special coke magic powers? Maybe I am missing something? Please let me know if I am!
2,Not that good. Realy not that good.,"I don't like it. i like IRN-BRU!!!!Anybody who prefers this over IRN-BRU IS A Moron. Anybody who drinks diet coke is a wimp.Irn-Bru is for Strong Scotsmen, so there is no diet version."
1,AMERICAN CLASSIC NOW WITH GMO SUGAR,"This product contains GMO's Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure, Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients. Shame on you"
3,"Too Much for a ""Recall"" Text","Although packed with good information, this text was just too big to fit in a ward coat, and held too much information to be utilized effectively, unlike other books in the series. There are better quick-review resources out there for use on the wards."
4,EXCELLENT ASIAN MYSTERY,This movie is a perfect example of an obscure gem just waiting for you to pick it up. It contains suspense and mystery with a touch of humor added as it unfolds. Great script + acting
3,natural colors are kind of pastel,"These natural food dyes are great for keeping toxins out of my food, but their range of color is limited compared to that of conventional artificial food dyes. Not that there's anything wrong with a subdued color palette. Just be prepared for different shades than what you're used to. Well worth it! I'd rather have a Dark Pink Velvet Cake with no toxins than a Red Velvet Cake with toxins!"
1,Terrible.,"I can't believe I wasted 16 bucks on these. As other reviewers stated, the blue is not blue. And the red is not red! It is fuscia! When I mixed ""blue"" and yellow, I got army green. Gross! I'm an artist, too, and know how to mix colors. These are beyond repair. Never again- give me my red 40 and my blue 1! Lol. Come on, once or twice a year, is it really going to kill you? Nah. (unless you are indeed one of the one in a gazillion people who has an anaphylactic allergy to blue 1)."
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,"I can hear conversations clearly, but the microphone distorts my voice unless I speak very quietly. Have tried many fixes including software update to no avail. Easier to use a good headset in my opinion."
5,partitas and sonatas for solo violin,"at laeast 20 words ! Classical music, this interpretation is considered as one of the must of partitas, espacially.Perfect. To put besides those of Nathan Milstein and Hilary Hahn."
5,it is a very good book,it is a very good book one of my favorite books i have read. it is more than a 10 it is a very very good book
5,A very good wax.,"I used to use Meguiar's Gold Class liquid wax, and have always liked it, but one day I decided to try out the paste version, and I must say I do like the paste wax alot more."
2,half of the product leaked before opening...disappointed,"I just want to say that most Meguiar's products are wonderful, but something went wrong with this one... On arrival everything seemed fine, however, on opening the package there was what looked to be leaked wax on the sides and I attributed this to another can of wax perhaps having leaked onto this one (because there was no leaked product anywhere else in the shipping box). Unfortunately, on opening the container, 2/3 of the wax had apparently leaked out but was nowhere to be found. since the Meguiar's box it came in was still factory sealed I can only attribute this problem to the product itself and not mishandling by shipping...I am very disappointed"
1,Meguiar's Gold Class Clear Coat Wax,This item is misrepresented. Meguiar's no longer makes Clear Coat Wax as pictured. I ordered this item because I did NOT want CARNAUBA wax but I received Meguiar's Gold Class Carnauba Plus Paste Car Wax instead. The Clear Coat Wax has been discontinued. I returned the Carnauba Plus wax and notified Amazon that this product does not exist but I see they are still offering it for sale.
5,I Am England,"If you enjoyed Sarum, you will love I Am England and its sequel, That Near and Distant Place. These books are both fun and easy to read, and a great way to learn more about English history. These books also remind me of Rudyard Kipling's Puck of Pook's Hill and Rewards and Fairies."
2,not overly impressed,Not quite what I expected. It feels like the handle has rigid plastic or metal inside. It's very rigid except for the first of the spatula. The first inch is so flexible that it makes me wonder if the silicone may crack over time.The same goes for the other end.
1,Waste of time - Pray your kid still likes science afterwards,"Yet another science-type toy that I hope doesn't turn my son off to science or engineering. There is no way that anyone actually attempted this before they marketed it and stamped the slinky name on it. At least a slinky goes down three steps before it turns sideways and rolls down the rest of the way. We tried a few of the setups on this pathetic excuse for fun, and NOTHING WORKED!!!! We spent multiple attempts winding the cursed copper wire into an electromagnet, and neither time was successful. The plastic pieces DO NOT FIT, and have those plastic burrs and flanges that you always wonder if you're supposed to trim off, or leave them.Looks like they have 8 left in stock right now, and I hope they let those 8 rot in their warehouse. Please don't reduce their inventory, for your kids' sake, and for the sake of our countries science and engineering future."
1,Cheaply Made,"I bought this for my 6 year old daughter who is extremely interested in how things work and are put together and capable of building things. But this product it extremely disappointing. It is so cheaply made that the product will not work without some major tweaking on dad's part. Even after that, it falls apart instantly. It's very frustrating that the company wouldn't spend a little more money in getting quality parts for the kit so kids can actually use and learn from it. I would not recommend buying this cheaply made product!"
2,A frustrating hour!,"The kids lost interest in this kit long before it was completed. Dad eventually finished the project by himself, but never got the buzzer to work. The instructions are poorly written and the materials are poorly constructed. We've purchased and assembled lots of different science kits, and this one just didn't measure up. We'll stick to Snap Circuits!"
4,Fair value,"The wreath was handsome, but a touch dry. Afterspritzing it for a few days, it seemed to recover enough to last until January 6. The wreaths sold by L.L. Bean are still the gold standard, in my opinion."
5,Mr.Afinque orchestra in its best performance in two decades.,"Great work by Willie Rosario, excellent appearances by Gilberto Santarrosa and Tony Vega. Great job by Luis Vergara and Mr. Walker in the vocals. Salsa at its biggest proportions with Papo Lucca and Bobby Valentin. If you like salsa music you will love this CD. Back to the Future brings the heavy salsa back to the real salseros."
3,Not as burgundy color as the description photo,"Also, I really thought this was going to be leather. I guess I was being naive. It basically is made to look like it is leather, but it's plastic. But as a mousepad it works well. No problems with my mouse. The little logo on the corner is kind of annoying. But overall I guess it's nice to able to put in photos and change them whenever I get bored.I also bought one in black leather."
4,"Still Valuable, Really Solid Basic Stuff","This is an even-tempered book, combining a good primer of the nature of the intelligence process with some analytically-oriented thoughts on needed improvements. Their appendix listing things that can go wrong at each step of the intelligence cycle is of lasting value, as is their glossary. Their forthcoming book, Best Truth: Intelligence in the Information Age (Yale, April 2000) will assuredly be a major contribution."
2,trapped,"to be polite, and it is hard to do with this movie. The name of the movie should be used for the audience, that is watching it. You want to watch to see if it gets better, well, let me tell you now, ""NO"". The story line was somewhat fair, the acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous and the events as they unfold, make no sense at all. What the lesbian scenes were about made no sense, if they showed more action in them, maybe, it could receive another point, Nick T. should give up acting, if that is what he wants to call it, the Director, should watch the movie and burn it,and I don't mean on a dvd, to save face. I think it was done as amateur week entries. Forget it and save your money and time."
1,The worst film I ever watched.,"The folks who came up with this turd should be sentenced to watch it all day, every day, for eternity. This should be their own private hell. If I could, I'd rate it -5."
5,Good cd,"Track listing...1. Good Sick2. Hannah Leah3. Night On Red River4. Lullaby For Blacktail5. Weeding Time6. Candy Gold7. Arrival, A Rival8. Good Fall9. How Does A Woman Fall?10. En Route11. Lonesome Place12. Texas Midnight Radio13. Weeding14. Good Sick II15. Janis, Don't Go Back"
1,Sanger's Life NOT in Her Own Words,"This poorly written book offers more of the words of the author, Miriam Reed, than Sanger's. There is no doubt that Margaret Sanger was and is one of the most unforgettable and fascinating figures in American history, but this book (I don't know how to define it) does not do her justice. Snippets of Sanger's words arescattered throughout undermining the author's intent, the documents are badly introduced and oddly over-interpreted. If the author wanted to write a biography she should have. If readers want to read Sanger's own words, check out her Autobiography. This one just doesn't do it. I, for one, am extremely disappointed."
5,A Great Book,An interesting book on early 20th century America that many of the recent immigrants like me are not aware of. It is fascinating and I highly recommend it.
1,Worst Customer Service Ever,"After multiple attempts at contacting the seller, my items still haven't arrived. They were due to arrive BEFORE Christmas. I had them planned as a special Christmas gift for my best friend who was visiting for outside the country, and paid the super expensive cost to ship them, and yet have received nothing. Sadly, my friend has already left the country, and I'm still trying to get them. The Seller responded once to an email I sent, in a very rude manner, and has yet to respond to any other emails. I'm very disapointed."
1,Worse than nothing.,"After fracturing a hip, I needed to really lean on my walker, and my hands were suffering for it. I bought these pads, and at first it was nice, much softer. After two days, the white had turned gray, so I washed them. Totally useless after washing. The velcro wasn't as clingy, and the pads wouldn't fit tightly enough on the handles, so it was very irritating to keep fiddling with them. Into the garbage they went, and I just had to tough it out."
5,Awesome product,Much brighter than OEM bulbs and looks better with the blue tint. I highly recommend this product to anyone who's looking for a better look for their car.
3,The truth hurts,"This book is about Mark Pizzimenti's senior year at the Air Force Academy. The book is labeled as fiction, but it is only fiction in so much as the names have been changed--and in some cases the names are very similar.It is impossible to fully appreciate this book unless you too have attended a service academy. I first read the book as a junior at the academy. I'm now a senior and the similarities between his experience and mine are striking. It is for this reason that this book should be considered non-fiction. I can find nothing in this book that doesn't happen here still, eight years later.If one wants to find out what USAFA is all about, read the propaganda, the admissions literature, and all the rest--but definitely read this book."
1,What a waste of time & money!,"I had been hesitating about getting this book for some time because of some of the negative reviews, but then I finally gave in & bought it because I love service academy novels. After a few pages I knew I should have listened to those reviewers & not bothered. This book was so awful I begrudge the money I spent on it! Essentially it's one long anti-USAFA temper tantrum (very poorly) disguised as philosophical musings. The so-called philosophy is really just pretentous twaddle. A novel has to have interesting characters & a plot. This has uniformly unpleasant characters, & a weak plot that's hidden by all the stream-of-consciousness ramblings of the author/protagonist. I didn't even finish it. For good service academy novels try James Webb, Gus Lee, David Poyer, Ed Ruggero, Pat Conroy. Even Lucian Truscott IV whose books I don't really care for is better than this guy! I agree with those who said this poor excuse for a novel deserves 0 stars!"
1,Plato goes military,"Give me a break! I bought this book because I'm interested in the Air Force Academy and it is ever so poorly sub-titled ""A Novel of The U.S. Air Force Academy."" Yet oddly one rarely sees Victor in his day-to-day business at the academy. He's either in town getting drunk or in somebody's office spouting philosophy. Victor's character is perfect; it is only his environment that compromises his experience. He spends most of his time trying to get through the dense skulls of his superiors. This is the whining saga of a depressed, arrogant kid. If you want to read something interesting and enjoyable about one of the service academies, try The Return of Philo T. McGiffin by David Poyer."
3,A good and practical book!,"A book simple of Applied Kinesiology. But that it contains related tips of the experience of the author. It is a good book of acquiring themselves and studying.A book that in assists them in the diagnosis of the problems that acomentem our patients, is of psychological or physical origin. I recommend."
1,No scientific evidence,"The Wiki review says it better than I: [...], but as a practicing chiropractor, I object to AK misrepresenting itself as ""kinesiology"". It isn't. AK also has no basis in science. It is similar to a now-defunct bogus treatment of autism to channel communication by autistic children by using keyboards manipulated by the parents of those children, who were simply unconsciously typing in what they wanted to hear from their children. AK has no test-re-test reliability and misunderstands neurology. While I held out hope for AK, it appears that it really has no place in medicine, chiropractic or otherwise, although doctors will continue to use it as an excellent way to manage patients' compliance with treatment recommendations (read: better for the doctor; not so good for patients)."
4,A very well written book by Tom & Carole and an underrated topic of health,"The previous review said more than I can rightfullysay here but I will ad that Tom's show, Midas Report-True Health is very good as well. Check it out at:9.985 mhz or 9.970 mhz shortwave one, Mondays andWednesdays, 3-4 p.m., WWCR, Nashvegas, TN."
4,Intimate concert in an intimate venue!,"What can be more appealing than watching one of the most annointed women in Godly music today in an intimate forum in an intimate setting - your very own room. It's like she is singing and leading you into a private session. Old classics revisited while she also performs the newest songs. My only complaint is that it feels as if it is cut short - I wanted, I thirsted for more."
3,Worth a read,"This is the autobiography of a physician - a PSYCHIATRIST who was abusing drugs since she was a child. She tells her story from the beginning until the very end when she finally leaves drugs behind. The book is worth a read but there are many religious undertones. If you want to read a good book about addiction without the religious fluff, I reccommend Speed & Kemtucky Ham by William Burroughs Jr. Those books touched my life."
2,"A Nice Summary, but . . .","This book is an excellent summary of several of the most important ""postliberal"" Pauline scholars and theologians. Harink is at his best when he focuses on Hauerwas and Yoder; he proves quite effectively that he understands each better than most critics (and critical readers). Unfortunately, when Harink turns to Wright, his examination falls apart and even turns into a vicous ad hominem attack at several points. Harink does not display a thorough understanding of Wright's work and, as one the previous reviewers on this page has noted, his summary is really a parody of Wright. Sadly, the weaknesses in the chapter on Wright betray further weaknesses in his scholastic aptitude, and his inability to comprehend the most important international ""postliberal"" Pauline scholar forces the reader to question whether he really has a grip on postliberalism (or Paul) at all."
4,"Good design, easy to use","This is a lightweight plastic device with a good design and a decent design quality. It's easy to use and does what it's supposed to.Be careful with the adapters ring used to attach this to the lens, some of them have white writing on the front which will reflect off of your filters and show up in your photographs. Google ""cokin design flaw"" for my example shot on flickr and review on Amazon about this issue. Cokin did say they would fix this in future versions, and i was happy with their responsiveness on the issue."
2,Weird priorities,"Too much bickering, and strange priorities - got halfway through before I couldn't take it any more. The heroine was really selfish and annoying - I'm sure it came out great in the end but I couldn't wait that long."
2,never in real life,It's not often that I want the heroine killed off before I am half way through the book but Josie was disgusting and truly in need of psychiatric help. By the end of the book I was wondering about Cooper's mental health. No sane person would have put up with her antics. I love Ms Brockman's writing but this book was difficult to finish. There was no one to root for except the kids and you had to wonder what would become of them living in that dysfunctional household.
2,Brockmann is not at her best here,"I'm a big Brockmann fan. I've read all of the Tall, Dark and Dangerous and Troubleshooters titles, but this one was so trite and predictable. I couldn't finish it. Josie was one of the most annoying characters I've encountered in a long time."
4,A Giant Among Composers For Strings,"Boccherini's music is wonderful. His arrangements are beautiful, exciting, playful, and fun. I know that he is considered by many to be inferior to Haydn regarding his compositions with strings. I disagree with this thinking. Surely, Haydn's body of work is impressive and is genius. I feel the same way about Luigi Boccherini. This Cd is excellent. The playing is superb and the recording is top drawer. I have listened to this cd multiple times - it is always a treat. If you enjoy listening to string arrangements, here's a wonderful addition to your music collection!"
5,The Best History of the Psychedelic Movement,"If you read the literature on the psychedelic movement widely enough,it can all become a bit of a jumble -- ""Hey, haven't I read about thissame party in four different memoirs?"" Jay Stevens does a wonderfulservice by telling this incredibly complex tale with grace, economy and clarity.He's fair, compassionate, and unlike a lot of other peoplewho have written about the counterculture lately, he ""gets it."""
5,Gotta throw in my five stars too-,"Fascinating history of psychedelic drugs that weaves it's way through pharmacology, psychiatry, academia and ends up in the middle of Haight Street... Mr. Stevens beautifully summarizes the cultural mindset of the 50's and 60's. What amazes me is how fast everything soured... I can't say enough good things about this book. What a trip..."
5,Once one begins Storming Heaven one can't put it down,Storming Heaven is by far the most informative and comprehensive work I have ever read about the 60's Psychdelic movement! A breathtaking roller coaster ride down the steep inclines of the human psyche. If this subject at all perks your interest you won't be able to put it down!
3,A comfortably mediocre history of the 1960s,"I'm at a loss to understand why everyone likes this books so much. One guess is that that the ""five star"" rating reflects the weirdness and coolness of the events portrayed rather than the history itself. Personally, I find the historical and bibliographic breadth limited, and the author's analysis and discussion of the events unfortunately never gets beyond the obvious. A somewhat better bet is Acid Dreams by Lee and Shlain."
4,mexican and great,"Its one of the best movies from him, his comedian way its at full size in this movie, and perhaps its enough to get the heart of anyone who sees it and understand it"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my grandson for Xmas, ther were alot of doubles @ triples, some had even four of the same card.I needed it for Xmas or I would have sent it back. I'm really disappointed in Amozon."
1,Garbage,"Dont even bother with this purchase, There are many other promising offers on amazon if you are looking to buy baseball cards. This seller does not stay true to their word and simply could care less about customer satisfaction. Nothing older than 1983 which by the looks of it is sadly an old year for this buy. Lot's of duplicates, share with your friends. The only good thing is that I didnt waste too much money on this garbage."
1,Baseball Cards,"I got 15 of the same card in this batch. They were in good shape, but there was a lot of repeats."
1,100% HORRIBLE!,"First thing, the ""collector box"" is a cardboard box from the post office that barely holds the 500 cards that are in the box, let alone the 550 that it states to hold.Also, there is a statement regarding ""cards representing 6 decades""? Nope, I've got back to the 80's!I understand that you get what you pay for...at least they could be up front and honest about what you get BEFORE you pay for it! This company doesn't even deserve 1 star!"
3,Don't count on the box being worth anything but trash,"All I got was a flat rate box with the cards laying flat and they were upside down right side up. All signs pointed to someone taking cards from boxes in a warehouse and then slapping them in a flat rate box with no QAing of any kind. Yes, the cards were in decent shape but there was no attention to detail or the feeling that it was made just for us. I was especially disappointed about the box they came in. I was hoping to gift my nephew but they ended up being in a make shift flat rate box so I had to buy a decent box to go to my nephew. Oh well, maybe it was my fault?Cards were in good shape though."
4,My child was fascinated for hours,"My 8 year old son loved this gift. He poured over the cards for hours, sorting them, pulling out his favorites, and putting them back in ""special spots"". Be aware that the box is full - you won't be able to put in any of your other cards you may have. Also the ""collector"" box is just a plain cardboard box - nothing fancy. This didn't matter to us, and it is a heavy, durable cardboard. The only downside to the gift was that some of the cards were duplicated in the box."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This product was a huge disaapointment. It was purchased for my 12 year old son who is an avid card collector. Not only were there no cards from the 50's, 60's or 70's (which were specifically mentioned in the description) but there were many duplicates. Doubles would be no big deal, but in some cases there were up to 21 of the same card! There was not a single card older than 1992. This was a total waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone other than someone with a 5-10 year old who is looking to bulk up a collection quickly."
2,Not the best,"Barely any of the cards are active MLB players, none of the cards are recent. The newest cards were in 2000"
5,A classic that's still relevant,"Even with all of the more recent collections and histories of anthropology, this work of Lowie's remains one of my go-to resources when thinking about where some of the key ideas came from and how they changed over time, for lectures and writing. Few scholars today remember many of the sources that were widely influential in the 1930s, and this is great for a reminder. The writing is clear and accessible. It obviously doesn't include more recent theory, but if you want to understand where those more recent developments came from this is a great source. I wish more anthropologists today would study this!"
5,one of the best albums of the year!!,"Michael Ball has done it again! This time he has taken some of the best comtemporary songs of the last thirty years, and gives it a theatrical approach. Not only does Michael pull it off, but they sound fresh. The best track is the very underated John Miles' ""Music"". The song is a performance for the ages, and Michael makes it sound like it came out of musical. All in all a powerful performance on all tracks. Highly recommended for anyone who apprecitates, and likes GOOD music, performed the RIGHT way. Michael you're a musical treasure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,One of the best,"I've been reading and collecting books of quotations since I was about 13, and this is one of the best I've found. The quotes aren't arranged by category, so every one comes as a pleasant surprise. And although the book title would make you think this is merely another collection of ""positive"" quotations, that isn't true. There's something for whatever mood you're in. I can't say enough good things about this book."
1,"Out of date, short on maps, and lacking style","I've just returned from a visit to the Twin Cities. My wife and I picked this book up because it was the cheapest guide on the shelf. You get what you pay for. This edition, at least, is out of date - many of the places of interest noted in the book have closed down or changed significantly. The maps in the book are limited to a very small area of downtown St. Paul and Minneapolis - yet the book recommends plenty of places that are off the maps provided. Finally, having gotten used to Lonely Planet guides, it's hard to fathom how this author could make his topic as dull as he does. That's my two cents - I'd recommend against buying the book."
1,"LIquid, not Grease","I was surprised when I opened this and saw that it is straight liquid, not a grease. Not sure if I can use it at all, I think I may use a rag and put some of this on it then rub it on the base of my elliptical... We'll see how that works out though. Would not buy again."
1,Not worth it!,"I was so excited about this product when I researched it however, there were definite issues after receiving it. 1. if you accidentally drop it, the keys will stick on you. 2. the mouse never worked properly. My suggestion, would be to find a wireless board that is more durable and has a proven track record. Good luck!"
1,Problem with sticky keys,"I bought three sets of this wireless keyboard/mouse combo, and initially was quite satisfied with the feel and compactness of the keyboard. However, that was about a year ago. Now all three keyboards have several sticky keys, and often it is difficult to get them unstuck. I am now at the point where I am wasting too much time fiddling with the keyboard and am just going to trash all three. Not worth the continual headaches. For this reason, I cannot recommend this combo (especially the keyboard), unless you are willing to replace it after a year or so of use."
5,If you have a PC in your home theater setup you need this,"When I first added a PC to my home theater set I was surprised to discover that conventional wireless keyboards have a range of only 3 feet or so. Not good if you are trying to work the PC from the couch. This set has the range to work from across the house which is a great improvement. The keyboard and the mouse also have a nice, solid feel and the mouse has a recharging cradle where you can store it when you are not using it. All in all, a very satisfying product."
4,"after slow set up, great performance","I like the design of this product. The keyboard is especially pleasing to my eye. I use it to control an old laptop computer in a cabinet under my TV. I haven't checked the max range but it works well out to 20 feet from the computer. That's plenty since I can't see the TV well enough to use it farther anyway. Setup was balky. The keyboard was recognized right away but I had to re-connect-reboot several times before the mouse linked in. I don't know why there was a hangup, but it seems fine now."
2,Not worth it,"The mouse stopped working after a few days, the laser went out. I contacted the seller (Beach Audio) and they said my recourse was with the manufacturer. How worthless are they? The manufacturer through an email issues me an RMA with all these special packaging instructions that was better than how it was shipped to me! Needless to say I will not be purchasing another IO Gear product (poor quality) or anything from Beach Audio (lame customer service). Beach Audio should have sent me another one and THEY deal with the manufacturer.I bought a Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse a year ago for a different computer and never had a problem with it. Save yourself the hassle and forget about IO Gear."
5,Perfect long range keyboard,"For anyone that does presentations and wants to setup their computer and projector on a table or AV cart and then stand up at a podium to face their audience to present, this is perfect. The range easily exceeds the advertised 30 feet and worked flawlessly. Great presentation tool that works great to advance slides in powerpoint and also hyperlink to the web or type in any documents that you need to show on-screen. Very sleek and lightweight too."
3,clear acrylic multi-purpose box,"This is just an average acrylic box. The lid aligns completely with the box - so, this makes the lid a bit awkward to lift and open. In comparison, the better, bigger, and heavier acrylic box is the one made by Huang Acrylic Inc. and sold by Stacks and Stacks."
2,Not so good,"Anne Murray is a great singer, with a beautiful ""alto"" voice...but this dvd is somewhat poor.You'll be doing a better deal with the CD containing the same tracks...The photography is not satisfactory. It looks like (and probably was) transferred from video to dvd format."
2,"Great design, not so good quality","I was very excited upon receiving the watch,I opened the boxAnd it really looked great a very good looking watch indeed.Unfortunately the quality was not up to par with the design , I found thatIt gave me the impression the materials were cheap.But what make me return the watch was the fact that the Glass was dirty on the inside around all the perimeter of the sphere, Amazon was great processing the return label."
5,excellent,"great watch, great price. very sleek. item received was just as described, and was shipped/received more about four days earlier than anticipated. shopped around for awhile and definitely found the best price here. you wont regret this watch."
3,"Beautiful mens watch, but pulls hair","I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. He wanted an all black watch and this one looked perfect. Within the first hour of wearing it though he was complaining of it pinching and pulling the hair on his wrist. I had to return it because of this.Other than that, there were no other problems with the watch. Its a shame, this is a great looking watch but there would be no way of knowing this would happen unless you were wearing it."
5,cannon by nixon,i chose the watch for the styling. it is absolutely gorgeous i love it im definitely going to order more
1,Who edited this????,"I'm only on page 32 and at least 3 times, the scene has changed with no notice. I don't recall that ever happening with one of Rochelle Alers books before. Hopefully this won't take me out of the story too much but it's already damn irritating.Update: This book was like many Rochelle Alers books from this publisher. I actually don't even think they are real Rochells Alers books. I need to check her website and see if these are listed as part of her work."
4,"""Well, I Liked It!""","The storyline of this novel reminds me of ""The Best Of Everything"", a movie I saw on T.V. and now have on D.V.D. I read this book then I stopped, after a few months passed I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did. To the other reviewers: What's so bad about this book?"
1,Skip this one - very bad,"I accidentally purchased this book without noticing this was a reprint. Big Mistake. This was before Rochelle Alers learned to write. No offense but this book is just plain bad. No story transitions, no romance, awful characters, etc. I decided to speed read this one just to get through it and I still want my money back. Sorry Ms. Alers, but you should have never reprinted this one - and I'm now a fan of your work - but not this book. If you reread it yourself you'll admit that I'm telling the truth because your work is MUCH better now. For Rochelle Alers fans out there that haven't read this one - DON'T - It'll only make you mad that you wasted time out of your life on such a pitiful jumble on words that make absolutely no sense. Fin."
