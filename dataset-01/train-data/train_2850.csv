1,Lock On: Modern Air Combat,Without the proper video card the graphics on this game DO NOT work. Everything is blacked out where there should be graphics. The system requirements don't tell you that you need a high end graphics card for this game to work. I contacted Ubi software. They told me in an email that I should use a GForce FX graphics card. At other websites they suggested a GForce 6600 graphics card with at least 256MB of memory. These cards range from $100 to $150. If you don't have the proper card DO NOT buy this game.
1,Fantastic Game,"This game is the best Air Sim ever created and what a bargain! All You need to make this work is an $8,000 computer with Holographic graphics and 3gigs of RAM. In other words, if You sell every thing you have and raise all the money you can beg, borrow ,or steal. Hey Brother, You got it made."
3,Not yet finished - Support will tell all.,"Potential to be a 5 star sim. Now a 3 star. This is due to the following:1. The game was released with many bugs and even the inability to run on some systems. Win 98SE for one.2. To run the sim at a reasonable frame rate with the graphics cranked up you need a very powerful system.3. The interface and key commands are taxing....not the most user friendly.4. It's really only for the hard core simmer but it doesn't always live up to ""hard core"".It can become a 5 star sim if there is GOOD support and comprehensive patching. It has that potential.This is mainly a graphic upgrade of Flanker 2.0 with additional aircraft to fly, but that's not bad because F2.0 was quite good.I do wish they had taken us away from the Crimea....I'm getting real tired of flying over the same areas over and over.I'm looking forward to both a good patch and additional aircraftbut for now it gets rather little play time...."
1,Buy Falcon 4.0,"I must say that this game does look beautiful. Its visualizations are gorgeous.HOWEVER, the game lacks in many other aspects. No air to ground radar, (What were they thinking)Substandard avionics, absurd system requirements, lack of realism, no dynamic campaign, too simple, non clickable cockpit & many other flaws.The game is very good, but it cant be compared with legendry games such as Falcon4.0.Regardless of its flaws, the game does prove to be entertaining for about 15 hours of gameplay. After that it starts dragging.It desserves a place in the top 20 combat flight simms but its way down the order from Falcon 4.0."
2,not large enough,"This grill/griddle is not long enough to fit my gas range so when I try to grill the pork on it, it keep moving from side to side. Also, it's not season yet. I tried season it but it still rust, maybe it's my fault that I didn't seasoned it correctly. Overall, I don't recommend this."
3,Kawasaki 19.2 Cordless Drill = Homeuse only!,"I purchased two of these drills for my husband and son for Christmas. The one will be fine for home use for my husband. However, the one for my son who is in the Heating and Air Condition business, did not work. He used it twice and it stopped working and the drill bits broke. I would not recommend this drill at all."
2,OK Drill,"I got this drill as a gift. This drill will work good for occasional use for a home owner but would not stand everyday use and abuse for someone who uses it for work.I just recently bought a 18v heavy duty dewalt drill and when you compare them side by side the dewalt is clearly a better drill.Pros:- Bubble level- 25 Torque settings- cheap, good for budget minded people.Cons:- The feel and grip of the dewalt is very nice and ballanced compared the the kawasaki.- The kawasaki is very light compared to the dewalt.- The 19.2 battery is also very light compared to the 18v dewalt battery which makes me wonder...- 3/8"" chuck, in lieu of a 1/2""- Slow charging- Battery drains pretty fast.I've bought many cheep drills over time and have gone through them all very fast. I recommend getting a better quality drill, as it will last you much longer. Spend the extra money, you get what you pay for. If you buy a DeWalt, Makita, Bosch, or even a craftsman you will be much happier."
1,Battery Life is Terrible,"I received this as a gift and thought it would be handy for small jobs around the house. But, like others have said, the batteries will not hold a charge. They go dead within 24 hours of being fully charged. I cannot always anticipate when I will need the drill, in which case I cannot start the charging process a day earlier and them ""top them off"" just before using the drill.BatteriesPlus has helped me with problems like this in the past, but their website does not show an exact replacement. I might see if they can rebuild the existing batteries using better cells. If not, the drill is a useless piece of junk. Frankly, instead of rebuilding the batteries, I probably should just purchase a new drill with better characteristics."
1,Don't Buy!!!!,I bought and the battery charge died. I asked for a replacement and it worked twice.Who replaces a product with a piece of junk... Alltrade Tools.BEWARE!!!!!1
1,Drill is junk,"You get what you pay for.........I bought one and it lasted a few months. I didn't have an issue with the batteries or the charger but the drill just stopped working. I gave it a good smack and it tried to work again. Took it apart to fix a loose connection, worked for another couple times more. Wasn't worth sending it in for repair. Who wants it? FREE"
1,Not very satisfied,Purchased the Kawasaki 19.2 Volt Cordless Drill Set and within the first few hours of usage the motor started smoking and smelling. This was purchased for around the home usage and did not hold up to my expectations.
1,Poor battery life,"Great tool and kit, but like others have said, battery is gets drained very quick just sitting there.Do not recommend this product."
2,Short life - stripped drive,"Bought this drill and had it around for more than a couple of years. Decent power. Battery life was ""ok"" for a Home use tool. Quick charge so next battery was ready before the other one died.The real issue I have is the drive stripped out a few months ago. I guess I overwhelmed it. Replaced it with the Mikita 18V Lithium Ion. I hate tearing up tools. I would not buy it if I was doing much more than hanging pictures and driving a few screws. It will not last long with heavy use."
5,Team Green is the bomb!,"I'm replacing an old drill that originally cost $99It's always been my experience to buy a double battery drill. However over the years the NiCads wear out, & it's more expensive to replace the batteries than to buy a new drill kit.I was just reading the Sears ad for 14.4 volt 3/8 Drill w/ two batteries.Reg. $59.99 - marked down $10.00- to $49.99 thru 12/09/06However, this Kawai' is 19.2v w/ two batteries & a 20pcs drill & bit set for an eqivalent price, shipping included.p.s. I love that bright green color!"
2,really poor battery life,"The drill is fine, and comes with a typical bit set, but the battery life is awful. Forget using it if it's been sitting on the shelf for a month. You've got to charge both batteries before doing anything just so you can make it through the job."
1,Junk.,I purchased one of these as I thought that a 19.2 volt battery would offer plenty of power and battery life. Shortly after purchasing it one battery died and I soon found out that the other battery did not hold a charge very long either. I finally threw it away after about six months so I would have to purchase a decent drill.
1,clutch when out on drill after 6 months,"this drill has no torque can stop drill with my hand batteries will not hold a charge, rather use a screwdriver than the power of this drill"
3,it is good it comes with warranty,I got 2 drills at Costco. First lasted about 5 months. Second one maybe 6 or seven. I had a pretty big remodelling job but it was not used all the time every day or even close to it. It came with two year warranty so I simply returned them back to the store for the full refund. The thing I like best about it is how light weight it is. It can really get hard on your wrist with a lot of drilling or putting screws in. It recharges fast and has a lot of torque. Probably a good choice for a casual user or with a good warranty.
1,Awfull battery performance,"The worst battery life ever, and the charger is hard to find ( ours burn up after a few uses )I agre with all the negative review."
1,terrible battery life,"I purchased this drill about 2 yrs ago, used it very little. I noticed everytime I did need it, the batteries were dead. Well now it has been a couple yrs, it came with 2 batteries, and I can not get enough out of either battery to put a screw in. I will never purchase this brand of anything ever again. Very dissapointing for a tool that has had such little use !"
4,"I buy Prima, but I was Impressed","Not really partial to Versus Books strategy guides, more of a Prima's person, but I was really surprised.If you want to find all the Orbus to include Blue, Green, Yellow, and maximize the Reds.Easy to follow walk thru, helpful screen shots, all rankings Explaind and enimies detailed.Get this Guide and Become a Stylish Devil Hunter and minimize your chances at being Dull."
2,very cool but stopped working!,"This is a very cool toy- the microwave spins the turkey (included) around as though it is being cooked like in a real microwave, however the toy stopped working after only a few months of occasional play! If you get it make sure you hang on to the receipts/warranty!"
2,Disappointed,Was very disappointed at how small this microwave was for the price . Yes everything is like a real microwave but microwave and buttons so small that it is not worth the money .
3,Impacts of patterns of responsibility on built environment.,"For a critical review of this book, please refer to the review published in the journal ""Third World Planning Review"", Volume 12, Number 2, May 1990, pages 197-198. The journal is published by Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, England. The book's theme centers around two arguments which the author posits as: 1) that patterns of responsibility in the traditional Muslim built environment were different from those today and affected all its aspects; and 2) that Muslim societies today can improve the quality of their built environment by changing the patterns of responsibility that operate within it."
4,better than the textbook,"I used this workbook while I was taking Japanese and found it extremely helpful. It laid out grammatical features in a helpful, organized manner by explaining what they mean and then giving a variety of examples. Along with grammer, it gives information on common phrases, particles (including a very handy cheat section in the back), and counters. I used this more than the textbook. For me, the textbook was confusing and too advanced for a beginner at times, but the suppliment helped bring everything together. I gave the book 4 stars because there were some errors in the introduction of grammatical features that should be fixed, but they are minor errors and can be figured out by looking at the examples.I am studying abroad this spring and this book, along with the second suppliment, are deffinately getting packed! I highly recommend this book!"
4,Useful and excellent for review,"I used this note when I did my 1st year Japanese MANY YEARS ago. It was very helpful as the textbook was quite tough. My advice to all beginners is that do at least 2 years Japanese if you can and spend a year in Japan. Otherwise, doing just one year Japanese would mean that you would forget it very soon and the time was completely wasted. The text and the two notebooks (1-15;16-30) cover the basic grammar of the language."
1,"my fault, wrong format","I didn't notice it was not USA formatted for our DVD's...I returned it and was given a refund - shipping&handling....it was really a shame too, as I love Dawn French."
2,I cannot believe this book cost [$$],"Yes, there were some tidbits of information in there that was informative. But it was written for what seems to be an audience targeted at 12 year olds. Larger print than normal, and a whopping 64 pages, I found the book to be over-priced and repetitive. I should have known when I saw the cover of the book that I was in for a surprise. But when I saw how thin it was, I was in SHOCK. Definitely NOT worth the money. If you feel you need to buy it, buy it used."
3,More positive than I expected.,"This book was really funny, and actually more positive than I expected. I checked it out of my local library, which is a much better way of reading it then paying the $25. Of course, like everything else about goths, it has to mention Columbine, and right at the begining of the book too. But I agree with some of the other people on here, that it's very watered down. I did expect it to be much more negative, like any other time the media mentions our scene. If you want a better book about the goth scene, tryWhat is Goth?orGothic Charm School: An Essential Guide for Goths and Those Who Love Them."
2,misleading,"If you read this book in order to understand goth that is not what you will get. This book is strongly biased against the goth movement (or whatever you want to call it) and frankly, it reads like something written for hysterical parents who are afraid their kids are goths or will be goths and we just can't have that can we? I bought this book and returned it."
4,Hilarious,"I second the notion that someone else wrote (""If you're Goth, this is one of the funniest bookd you'll ever read."")This book is hilarious, extremely repetitive and waters down the scene, but so so funny. Oh god, those photographs.On ths plus side (save for the humour content) I think this would reassure parents who are concerned about their offspring being involved in the scene. But one would be better served by talking it out or writing a paper (Siouxsie and the Banshees and Romanticism, anyone?) then giving them this,"
4,An Excellent and Trustworthy Overview,"I read this down-to-earth textbook and then passed it on to my daughter who is just turning thirteen in New York City. Frankly, I am relieved to offer her such a non-judgemental, compassionate overview of the Goth scene. The writer, Kerry Acker, makes the lifestyle seem intiguing and accessible. Her simple and interesting descriptions of Goth clothing, music and beliefs do away with much of the false mystery surrounding the Goth world. If, after reading it, my daughter wants a more in-depth description, I will get her one. For now, though, I am happy for her to read this interesting textbook of sorts."
5,a terrific help to those dealing with this painful issue,"I found the book to be most helpful to those dealing with the painful issue of infertility. The authors presented the information in an easy to read, informative style. The information provided is up-to-date. I recommend this book highly."
2,"Good questions, but not very good answers","I read this book and I felt like none of my questions had been answered. The questions were all very common with infertility, but I was looking for guidance in how to deal with them. I didn't get any help. It was kind of like the authors were trying to be kind and not take sides on the issues. I wanted the blunt answers to use when dealing with infertility. Example if you are invited to a baby shower and didn't want to go. It was all well you can go and avoid the opening of the presents and blah blah blah. I want to know if this feeling is normal and if I don't want to go I am not being a bad person!"
2,There are better choices out there.,"I did not learn anything from this book that I did not already know. Most of the information included comes under the definition of common sense. If you're looking for a book that will really give you practical strategies by which to deal with infertility issues, there are better ones out there. From a literary standpoint, this was not a well written piece.From what I've been told, the authors don't have the best reputation for professionalism either."
5,A Great Resource to Cope with Infertility and Miscarriage,"After reading this book I had the courage to seek a second opinion and try an ""experimental"" approach to treating recurrent miscarriage. This book not only provides excellent information but it is written in a personal way that helps you feel like you are not alone in your struggle. My husband also found this book to be very ""user friendly"". As a therapist, I highly recommend this book as a resource for any therapist treating people with infertility or recurrent miscarriage. The authors have written a book that is full of information as well as words that comfort and soothe the soul."
5,"I highly recommend this book. I call it my ""coping bible"".","I'm very impressed with this book. It's brand new at the book stores and the best I've read on coping. Reading it, you can't help but feel that the authors actually ""get it."" They understand what it feels like to ride the infertility emotional roller coaster.The book covers keeping your identity, primary and secondary infertility, communicating with your spouse, friends and family, balancing a job and baby making, coping with grief and loss, decision making, when to know to move on, and even child free living. It also covers waiting for your baby whether it's through adoption or pregnancy.I really feel this is GREAT. It's a must have for everyone. I've only had this book a few weeks and it has already helped me to cope with my decision to move on to a life after infertility and remain childfree. Those who know me, know what a struggle this has been for me.I highly recommend this book. I call it my ""coping bible""."
5,Fig Newmans,"We enjoy this product, Newman's Own Organics Fig Newmans, Fat Free, 12 oz, but our local Tom Thumb quit carrying them. We were very please with our purchase at Amazon. The price was cheaper than the grocery store, the delivery was very prompt, and the cookies were nice and fresh. We will definitely buy more from Amazon!"
1,NOT Gluten-FREE,This product should NOT be listed under gluten-free products. It contains Barley as a major ingredient. Barley is a major source of gluten.
5,Satisfying and healthier than most sweets!,"My children and I choose to have these cookies with tea, time after time. My fifteen year old especially loves them. The cookies are packed with juicy figs and have a pleasing chewy texture. They are sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth, but not offensively sweet. I was also pleased to find out that the Newmans Own company orders their corn syrup from Austria, where no GMOs(genetically modified organisms) are allowed. This results in a pricier item, but I like our treats to be healthy and satisfying.They are better than Fig Newtons, hands down! My neighbor was over for tea the other day and he commented on them and said he would have his wife pick some up.If you like figs, you will love these cookies!"
1,Not so hot,"I didn't enjoy them at all. Like many low-fat dessert items, these had an unpleasant gummy texture. And I found the flavor quite bland. I'm rather amazed that others find these enjoyable. Each to their own taste. Caveat emptor."
3,Not gluten free.,"Please note that these are not gluten-free, although they came up for me when I clicked on a gluten-free link. Newman's are good, but this is not for the gluten-intolerant."
4,Really Cool,"I just got this yesterday, figuring it'd be great for walking the dog after daylight savings. There are so many other uses, though. Low and high white lights - great for reading or just illuminating your way. I even put it in the pumpkin, set to three color strobe, for a cool effect. Attaches easily with the clip or lanyard. Cyclists, joggers, police officers, firefighters, and so on can make use of this. Especially great to have on boats or out hiking, as it is waterproof, and even has an SOS signal."
3,Most Interesting Thing about this Book is the Author's Name,"Which is not to say it is a bad book, by any means. Unpolished, maybe, but not bad.Sparkle Hayter has created a hapless alter-ego in Robin Hudson, newswoman for the thinly-disguised ANN, 24-hour news network. Robin has been in better positions, but has been steadily dropping off the radar scope due to some poorly-timed mistakes. This serves to make Robin a likeable underdog for whom we root with gusto.The plot: Someone is blackmailing ANN's on-air personalities. The blackmailer is murdered. Now Robin and her coworkers are all suspects. That's it.It's pretty easy to follow, being an uncomplicated romp through the back rooms of live television news, and has its humorous moments,but is overall a ""commute"" book - one to read while on the train, or stuck in traffic, or waiting for a dalayed plane. There really isn't enough here to engage a fully-attentive brain."
5,Fabulous glamour real girl meets strange world.,"Robin Hudson is a dame's dame. She might be a ordinary woman trapped in Rita Hayworth's body, but, she's definitely the kind of woman you want on your side in a fight or at least, you want her cat on your side. She's not perfect, she doesn't have men swooning at her feet and she hates her job -- how close is that to real life? The Robin Hudson books are mind candy with vitamins and minerals. A definite must read!"
5,Loved it!!!,I've been in such a reading funk lately- not having much of an attention span to read anything but the newspaper or magazines the past 2 months but Hayter's book was such fun that I was glued to it from start to finish. I can't wait to read her other books!
2,"not bad, but less chatter","This book was fairly interesting, but the plot tended to get lost in the massive amount of what I felt was useless dialogue. She explains too much, way too much in some instances. So much dialogue, and nowhere near the amount of interesting stuff, that I almost quit reading the book, but stuck it out to the bitter end.."
5,Worth the Read,"Robin Hudson is an absolutely lovable character. She is not too unrealistic and admits her fault, which automatically in my minds is a GREAT quality for any character. The fact that she is accused of murder and has to go through ridiculous situations cracks me up. Sparkle Hayter successfully created a lovable character with a funny story that was absolutely worth the read. It was a quick read for me, I read it in two hours (but I am a really fast reader) my friend who doesn't like reading and usually refuses to read, read it in three days and loves the series. If she loves it that much than it is obviously worth the time. Great story line, Awesome Characters, and an Original Plot."
4,Smart and Sassy,"I really enjoyed reading this book, it kept me guessing and kept me entertained. An easy to read and enjoyable tale."
3,Not Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series,"I read all the books in the Robin Hudson series while waiting for the next Stephanie Plum book to be released -- I was looking for something with the humor, romance, sexual tension and mystery of the Plum series. Of all the books in the Robin Hudson series, What's A Girl Gotta Do? comes the closest to capturing those elements of the Plum series. The other Robin Hudson books are lacking in the romance and sexual tension areas. All of them are funny, with some zany characters or situations, though!"
2,Pales in comparison...,"Having read the first in the Robin Hudson series, I must admit I am disappointed. Originally drawn to this genre by Janet Evanovich and later Katie Munger, I was expecting the kind of tongue-in-cheek, leg-slapping, laugh-out-loud hilarity I had grown so fond of. As much as I devoured Evanovich and Munger, completely unable to put down their books, starving for more from each author, I had to force myself through Hayter's first effort.It's not a bad story, mildly amusing at times, but not funny. It occupies the mind, but doesn't feed it and leave it hungry for more. I'm sad when I've finished an Evanovich or Munger...sorry that it's over. I don't get that from this book.Maybe I'm spoiled. But call me spoiled and disappointed. I bought the entire Robin Hudson series with high hopes. Now I'm wondering if I'll even read the rest..."
1,So disappointed,"Had high hopes for this book but couldn't even stick to my ""Read 50 pages before you decide"" policy. Pitched it into the second hand bag. Don't waste you time or money."
1,Major drop in quality,"The last pair of Wrangler jeans I bought lasted more than a year before they finally wore out. The pair I just bought is already falling apart after only a month. One of the belt loops already broke and the stitching on the leather logo is coming out. They do have a 1-year warranty, but the process looks so long and difficult (call them - only from 8-5 M-F - to get a pre-paid shipping envelope, ship to them, wait 4-6 weeks), I think I'm just going to buy a different brand next time."
2,sizes run very small,the 35 in. waist that I ordered were smaller then the 34's that I am currently wearing (Both Wrangler and same style)
2,50/50 Toss of the Coin for Getting a Correct Fit,"Bought 2 pair of the exact same style, but different colors.The first pair the waist seemed to run a bit large, but the length was perfect!The second pair, the waist was perfect, but the length was 2"" short!That's the problem with so many foreign made products out there; none of them seems to have any pride in what they manufacture. And we end up paying for it with no chance of consistency in quality, styling, sizing, color etc!From 1947 - 2001 Wranglers were all made in the USA and always fit the same, pair after pair. Come 2001 all that changed as they went south to Mexico for production!There's only 2 ways you'll get that perfect fit every time...1. A lucky coin toss, or2. They bring it all back to the good old USA!I think we all know the answer to that. So start practicing your coin tossing before you buy, because you only got a 50/50 chance of winning."
2,Over Priced,Paid $28.99 for this pair of jeans thru Amazon. Target has them EVERYDAY in store for $16.99. What a Ripoff!! Will not order there again.
2,Short of Belt Loops.,"I've worn Wranglers for years and this is the first time I've recieved them with only 5 (five) belt loops, all my others have 7 (seven) loops. Come on Wrangler, why cheapen a good product. I won't buy more."
2,Cheaply made on every level.,All my life I have thought of Wrangler as being Levi's main competitor for durability and quality construction.These jeans end that image of Wrangler in my mind. Dollar store specials would be more appropriate.
2,belt loop stitching comes loose,I have had four pair of wrangler jeans have one of the belt loop stitching let loose...contacted wrangler and they said to send them in and I would be taken care of. I sent them in and haven't heard from them since.
1,Wrangler R. I. P.,"I'm not hard on clothes, I'm still wearing some items purchased ten years ago. So imagine my surprise when I discovered that on these lightly-worn jeans a belt loop had ripped out. No, not the thread used to attach the loop. The loop stayed attached and tore out a hole in the back of the jeans. Unbelievable."
1,This particular item is not a Wrangler Original,"I own a lot of Wrangler Jeans and these are clearly knock-offs. They aren't made in China, but Mexico. The labels and stitching were a dead give away when I opened the package. I also found them to be two sizes under what the label indicated. Waist was measured at 34 when it should have been 38. Wrangler makes a great product if you can find originals. I would avoid purchasing these unless you are ok with not breathing when your pants are two sizes too small."
2,Sizing is all wrong...,"I went to a local brick and mortar and bought 3 pairs of Wranglers as it was 'time'I wear 34W x 29L but the store I went to didn't have them, so I got the 34x30 and to me they just seemed baggy at the legs. However, they fit fine in the waist, so the 34w wranglers are the right size, but these are not.I checked Amazon and they had these 34x29! Great, I bought a pair.Too tight, like I don't have a gut, but this sausage wrap makes my skin squish over the waistband so it looks like I do. They feel like size 30 or 31. I think even 32 would fit tight, maybe let me put a few fingers in my waistband, but these are too tight.If you are going to purchase these jeans, get the next size up.These Lee Jeans have the same issueLee Men's Regular Fit Straight Leg Jeanin that they are way too tight for the size indicated.I got theseDockers Men's Classic Fit 5-Pocket JeanDockers Jeans at 34 x 29 and they fit perfectly."
3,Jeans are way too dark,These jeans are not the color shown in picture. They would need to be washed at least 10-15 times to look as they do in the photo.
1,too big,"was looking for an alternative to 501's size 34-34 and bought these in the same size. Even after multiple wash and drys at high hear for hours, still too big. Oh well, it was worth a try."
4,Good quality,"Very nice standard jeans, the inseam length is a little plus but generally its OK.i bought it along with one LEVI's 501 and i like both of 'em"
5,Perfect jean and perfect price!,"This is a perfect jean with perfect price. The very same one sold in department store of Shanghai is about RMB600, that is about USD$90, but I bought it with only USD$22 on Amazon. I love Amazon.Perfect fit to my legs, especially my waist. The color is also what I like, the very traditional blue. I suggest using brown belt, it will be better than black one."
2,poor sizing,"Recently purchased from amazon.Needed waiste size 35 and thought these would fit the bill.They must use a differant size chart than all others,much to tight and very thin material,poor workmanship.Also purchaced two pair Riggs workwear jeans same size and very well satisfied.Perfect fit,good workmanship and top material.Would give these a 5star.The Wranglers a reluctant 2."
1,Not very durable,"This is the only pair of jeans I've ever bought that have already torn twice less than a year later--losing a belt ring and ripping down the middle under the zipper. The guarantee only covers a return and replacement, and it's not easy to find a size 35 to wear while you wait for that."
1,Wrangler Jeans - Terrible,"Wrangler Jeans fell apart within six months, with holes and tearing developing after several washings.I would hope for a refund"
5,Priced right!,"Great fit, wears good. Wrangler makes some of the best fitting jeans and they are very durable comfortable and priced great."
3,I love Alan Price,"but this is not a great concert. It's okay, and maybe that's what he was like at this period, but it's tough when the soundtrack to Oh! Lucky Man is just so perfect."
4,Great introduction to gardening with deer,"This book intoduces a lot of good ideas for detering deer from one's yard and covered all kinds of fencing options--even one only about 4' tall!! The list of resistant plants is plentiful, but a lot of them are eaten by the deer in my area. Poisionous plants are not included and would have been helpful as not everyone has to worry about children/pets."
2,Art Robbers,"A retelling of many of the biggest heists in the art world and particularly one collection that is hit several times. The most interesting fact was that stolen art is used for currency in selling and buying drugs, rather than trying to fence the art itself. Surprising little intelligence on the part of the thieves."
4,worth the anticipation,"Similar to the other North American Back To Mine releases by Danny Tenaglia, Groove Armada and Faithless, EBTG's take on downtempo is a broad umbrella covering soulful house, funk, trip-hop, disco and R&B. It makes for an enjoyable home listen, and that's the point. What sets this mix apart from the others is the inclusion of a couple tracks by Detroit techno innovators Model 500 (Juan Atkins) and Carl Craig. In my opinion, the mix strays a bit near the end with The Roots - ""Silent Treatment,"" a somewhat more raucous rap selection that doesn't quite feel right straddling the already-established mood. Also, I don't really care for the 70's style crooning of Donny Hathaway at the end of the CD, but I'm sure someone else's review will praise this, so as always, it all comes down to personal taste. Considering my own personal taste, this is a solid 4-star effort; this will definitely get plenty of listens alongside my other Back To Mines."
5,STILL the best of the series,"I own all of them, and I must say, this is still the very BEST in the series. Recent efforts by Orbital and New Order have been disappointing and just don't even compare. EBTG, Faithless, Nick Warren, and Talvin Singh stick to the original ""chill"" premise.""Turn the lights down, pour yourself a drink, and kick back.."" Wasn't that what the Back to Mine series was suppose to be all about?"
4,The Best Complilation in a Long Time,"Jez, I don't know how any consumer could look at the track listing and think this was a new EBTG album?? Go figure. Anyway this is a brillant, sensitive compilation but together by none other than the brillant and sensitive duo, Everything But The Girl. The chill starts and never stops. The only track that slightly upsets the mix is The Roots ""Silent Treatment""--but in itself is great, just a little heavy on the uptempo for the rest of the mix. Favorites are Model 500 ""The Flow"", Beth Orton ""The Stars all Seem to Weep (destined to become a classic), and the spine tingling track contributed by Mary Margaret O'Hara ""To Cry About"" (Whatever happended to her??). The thought put into this compliation is evident after the fist listen, the mixing is seamless. Get this! Summer has offically begun."
3,<<<< Too disappointing for me >>>>>,"I have Morcheeba's BTM, Groove Armada's and Danny Tenaglia's.I really love this series. But this title is disappointing.After being EBTG fun for a lot of years and waiting for there new titles impatiently, I probably was just waiting for something supreme, and this is simply not it...Not a single inspiring track. There are some good moments in the CD but not moments you get addicted to.Maybe I was just not in the right mood?... )-:"
1,Wrong product--No response,"Received the case but the wrong CD was inside. And it was Jack Johnson---I can't stand Jack Johnson. Anyway, tried to send an e-mail back to their site and got rejected twice. No phone number given to call. Sure it was only $5.00 I was out, but I'd rather have it back or the product I ordered."
4,I'm a bit hooked,"Okay- after 1st listening to this CD- I didn't really get it... I thought that it would be EBTG- but it wasn't... but what I got instead was beautiful music to listen to on a sensual summer evening. The music and the re-mixes are so unique- I wish they's play this music in some clubs- it is great to dance or chill out to.As I have found in every EBTG CD that I've explored, each album is different from the next, but they show great development in the artists and their musical taste and style.This may spur me to buy another Back to Mine album..."
4,Everything They Touch Is Magic,"I was a little confused after listening to the CD the first time... Where is Tracey? I have been a huge fan of EBTG since their inception. (Even before they were being played on muzak radio station. What a shock it was when I actually heard them in an elevator. What a cliche, what tragedy). But, I been loving their transformation. I saw them in concert a few years ago, Ben dj'd before the show, Tracey's voice was as mesmerizing as ever... she sounds better live! Same as my recollection of being at their concert upteenth years ago (without their newly found electronics, of course). This CD loses a star because I was really looking forward to hear Tracey sing. Despite my disappointment, it still is a great chilling music... time to dim the lights now..."
4,Let some friends turn you on to some music they like,"The great thing about the back to mine series is that you get a nice introduction to some music you may not have been aware of before.I'm an old guy (37, though fortunately I'm very immature) and so it's not like I'm hanging out at clubs listening to what the DJs are doing...This listen was well worth it simply for hearing Donny Hathaway's gorgeous ""Someday We'll All Be Free."" I was totally unaware of his music even though he is from BEFORE my time.Most of the rest of the tracks are great too."
2,Decent Compilation,"A decent compilation, but it's misleading to present this as a CD by Everything But the Girl. ""Various Artists"" should be the credit. I knew what I was getting when I bought the CD, but I can't help thinking there will be disappointed customers who instant-order the CD the minute they see the name."
2,Disappointed,"I was thrilled to see a new EBTG release and eagerly bought at my favorite CD store. However; after the first few tracks I realized this wasn't the ""real"" Ben & Traci. As it turns out, this is a compilation favorite songs by EBTG. What a rip off!!! The music for the most part isn't bad, but marketed as a EBTG CD is false advertising!"
3,NO DE MI GUSTO,EN 2002 BACK TO MINE LANZO UN ALBUM MEJOR MEXCLADO QUE ESTE EVERYTHING BUT THE GIRL QUE SUENA FLOJO Y CARECE DE CREATIVIDAD.
4,"Thoughts about ""Back to Mine""","This is a very good, well-composed album of down-tempo, hip-hop, and urban lounge grooves, but Tracey Thorn lovers note: this is a collection of songs she loves, not an album of her music. In my enthusiasm for Thorn's music, I bought this music thinking I would hear her latest work, and was disappointed to find that her tunes were nowhere to be found on this album. My disappointment was mitigated by the fact that this album is good stuff - very chill, smooth, and well worth the purchase price."
4,Comforting tunes,"Im not a big fan of 'recycled' music in the sinse that its mixed and remixed to alter it from its original status but not make different. In this collection of rehashes Im pleased to discover that big flaw has been rectified. You can hear traces of the original music but the remixed style is clearly dominant in a very respective way. My one regret is Tracey Thorn's voice isnt on this collection, still if you are a big ETBG (from the beginning not just 'Walking Wounded') then you will like it."
1,Disappointing- I'll sell you my copy,"The methods of training in this book are outdated and are not aligned with acceptable practices of 'do no harm to the dog'.There are many ways to train dogs with positive reinforcement other than what is suggested here.Like some popular personalities who are not using updated behavior techniques, this author misses the mark.I can't recall if it was this book or his other one where he HITS THE DOG'S PAWS for jumping on the fence!There is no need to hit a dog to train it.Even with beautiful, strong breeds like the shepherd, you can establish respect for humans without ""alpha rolls"" and dangerous practices like hitting the dog.I recommend Victoria Stilwell as an author who truly knows modern, positive training methods."
5,like oem,put it on my 72 imperial that the previous owner had setting for 20y...worked great no probles just like oem
1,Feminism Vs. the Navy,"Why did Kara Hultgreen die? She died because the Feminist lobby in America had to have a female Navy fighter pilot. The fact that she was not ready to flight off a carrier was less important than the desire to have her do so. Are others to blame as well? Yes, clearly the Navy deserves some blame for caving in, but their image concerning women was so damaged by Tailhook that they were willing to do what the Feminists wanted."
1,Mom Doesn't Know Best,Here in San Antonio the Hultgreen story was big news as her country club mother grieved in public and tried to justify her deceased daughter's failure. This family is prominent and cannot deal with her failure. LT Hultgren was rushed through flight training; she should have washed out. A man in LT Hultgren's situation would have washed out. The ONLY reason she was allowed to graduate (who cares what her class rank was) was to mollify the politically correct crowd in the Navy. Those (such as her mother) who reason that LT Hultgren must have been qualified because she graduated miss the point: she should have been failed on the same basis as any man This book contains half truths and misquotes. It is worth reading if you want to see the depths to which feminist writing can sink.
2,HMMMMM....,"I was disappointed with this book. I thought I was going to read about some ""dirt""..but no..its written by her mother..so you won't. If you want to know why some of the other female officers didn't like Kara, etc....you won't find it here..because once again..mother wrote it! I got the impression she wanted to be a man and had to prove it...time and time again. If you want to read mommy telling everyone how pretty Kara is..then by all means read it! If you don't..don't bother. If you ask me (and you won't) women have no place in a fighter jet..they do not have that true killer instinct that a man has...that's why under the canopy they have what is called a ""cockpit""."
5,Kara was an inspiration...,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. I think it was beautifully written with enough of Kara's own journal entries and letters to friends and family that you really get a sense of who she was and how she lived.I think that she should be remembered as an inspiration, not only to young women, but to young people everywhere, that if you really set your mind to it, you can do anything!It's been 10 years now since this amazing woman lived her dream and I pray that, not only is she remembered, but that she is remembered for her amazing accomplishments, her brave spirit and never ending courage.Kara Hultgreen is a true American success story and thank you Ms. Spears for introducing her to me."
4,a tragedy beyond her control,"As someone with F-15 experience myself - the Air Force's F-14 ""equivalent"" - I know how quickly airborne circumstances can change which can turn a seemingly routine sortie into a potential tragedy. I've lost six friends (highly qualified pilots) in F-15 and F-16 mishaps over the years and never once did their flight records become available for public consumption and analysis. Kara should've been given the same consideration. We're all aware of the inherent dangers being a fighter pilot; its just unfortunate - posthumously - that she was the military's first female fighter pilot which prompted such unprecedented scrutiny.Its a thought-provoking book for many reasons."
1,A feminist whitewash,"It reads like a novel, that's my first problem with ""Call Sign Revlon."" The author frequently drops into dialogue and present tense narrative leaving me confused as to the source of those quotes and actions as most lack substantiation. The endnotes are a meer page and one-half which has a bearing on believability. Some naval officers reputations are shreaded and I had no clue as to the author's source.Second, and this is why I call it a feminist whitewash, is Lt. Hultgreen's F14 flight training. Her records were leaked to the press and the public discovered she had four ""downs"" enough to washout a male pilot. Facts that were not mentioned as the entire point of this book is to prove that Kara Hultgreen had the right stuff and could fly with the best male pilots. Knowing the truth about her F14 training makes me think that this book is a whitewash."
2,Mixes fact with fiction.,"As one of the O-4's mentioned in the book in a not too kindly manner, I found the book interesting. The writer did not always get her facts straight with the events with which I am personally familiar which makes me wonder about the rest of the book. Be that as it may, the book tells the story of a misguided lady who had no business flying Navy jets. Kara had such a big chip on her shoulder that she could not discern constructive criticism from good natured ribbing or just nit picking remarks from those who might not like women in the military no matter how good they are. In short, she never knew her own limitations and pressed the envelope before she was ready. Somebody should have stood tall and stopped her, but they didn't. It wasn't a matter of if she was going to have an accident, it was a matter of when."
5,printer table,This was just the right size and space for what I needed. I have my CPU and printer on top and my scanner on the botttom shelf. Easy to put together and well made- great deal.
2,"Horrible quality control - had to partially rebuild it, final product is O.K.","In theory this product is easy to assemble and looks nice. Except when I finished there was one extra piece in the box which turned out to be part of the drawer rail that had broken off. We had to glue this overnight and then finished the assembly, only the legs did not fit in properly so the space was too wide for the bottom shelf and it kept falling off. We then had to redrill some of the screw holes so the legs could screw in properly. So, what should've taken 10 minutes to assemble took about 3 hours + waiting overnight for glue to dry, a trip to the hardware store and about $10. Plus, when it was finally assemble I noticed there was a HUGE scratch on the tabletop. Luckily my printer covers it."
5,WeatherTech Floor Liners,Bought these for my Tacoma after searching the internet for countless hours. Amazon had the best price and I got them in 2 days!! These are the best things to protect the floor of your vehicle. They cover everywhere my foot would go from entering the vehicle to when I am driving. After only a few days I was able to see what would have ended up on the floor had I not bought these liners. I love how they come over the door threshold as well.
5,Siri Aang a delight,"Our Secret - Siri Aang is a well-written, thoughtful and evocative book for young people. The Maasai girl in this story is full of energy and courage, even though the traditions in her life are beginning to clash with her new awareness. The author, Cristina Kessler, writes with insight, love and a huge talent.Africa and the Maasai culture come alive in this story, woven into adventure and intrigue.No matter where Kessler might be, when she writes of her beloved Africa, she is there. And so are we.- Jacqueline BuieSanta Cruz, CA"
3,Caviar,"This made my hair greasy, it smells wonderful and my baby fine hair was very manageable after using this product. But, I wont purchase it again."
4,Better price than salon,I bought this conditioner at a salon and the Amazon price is better. It has worked for me and made my hair fuller and softer.
5,Brain Attack,As a Holistic Nurse I was so very happy to see how another nurse would handle this situation of a Brain Attack. She clearly defined her position and was proactive from the beginning as she was involved in her own drama within the medical system. I would recommend this book to all those who work with stoke patients and also to the general public to better understand their friends and family that are going through this recovery process. Hat's off to Polly for the gift she has given us all.
2,Did not like it,I did not like this song at all it was just terrible but no Stupalicious but a little bit better utter crap musicLyrics 1/10 Production 7/10 Overall 4/10
2,Bland and Self Righteous,"Unexciting Black pop ditty in which our heroines bite back at haters who, they claim, tried to drag them down. Although it's not explicitly mentioned, the song is clearly about their former members who left the group. Whatever. ""Survivor"" is a single that's self-congratulatory at its worst. To me, being a survivor means going through several hurdles in life, having your heart broken at least once, and facing serious adversity. These ladies, managed by Beyonce's father, hardly know the meaning of the word ""adversity."" Nonetheless, this jam isn't a bust, but it's a dull and unconvincing single off their third album."
2,Too much sugar is added,"Too much sugar is added to the dried mango. It doesn't taske like mango. And it is too soft.The containers are too flimsy. Half of my 6 containers were broken when arrived, exposing the mango to air. The shipping box is intact. Just the mango containers; they are no good.The mango from Brand Philippine is much better."
1,Way too much sugar!,I prefer the no sugar added dried mango. This has no mango taste and the sugar is bad for you.
2,Unreadable due to formating,"Unfortunately I'm not going to be able to read this otherwise excellent looking book. The Kindle translation makes a mess of the non-standard text characters, which is very distracting. As I'm learning about another culture, I'd like to be able to speak clearly about the names and places in the book and not just have a vague symbol recognition of the various presented nouns."
3,A 19th century Englishman speculates on the origin and nature of Indian popular religion,"The religion of India is a bewilderingly complex subject, stretching back over thousands of years. Here Barnett is concerned with the folk and village religions not the Brahmaic speculations on philosophy and higher religion. He attempts to show how these religions (because they were vastly different from one another) evolved from the age of the Rig Veda on.Barnett's speculations are fascinating for the student of religions or India, but they are speculations. Barnett doesn't present them as such, but given both the paucity of the records, even for sophisticated Hinduism, in many eras, and given Barnett's level of scholarship, they couldn't be anything but.The book is an interesting attempt to untangle a complex subject, but readers should keep a saltshaker handy."
1,wretched translation,"The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is all that the other reviewers say that it is, but this translation is extremely poor. Ingram -- who was writing in the 1810s & 1820s -- dreamed up meanings when he could not parse the Anglo-Saxon, which occurs in many places.Mind you, it's not his fault: We learned a great deal about the Old English language(s) between 1850 and 1950. But for this reason alone, you must buy a more modern edition.Lastly, Ingram's method of collating all nine manuscripts together lands him in the soup, with a large number of contradictions, single events happening twice, and so forth."
5,Historical Manuscripts,So glad to be able to get these ancient histories and manuscripts in ebook form. As a history buff this is a wonderful way to accmulate all types of historical material and store and use it anywhere needed.
4,An unique season,"Survivor Palau is a must-have for any Survivor fan. This season is unique in a couple of ways, including the first introduction to Exile Island. Watching this season reminded me how great this show can be, unlike some of the more recent seasons. Great players, brutal challenges, and plenty of drama!"
4,survivor palau,"survivor palau is brillaint it has an extrordanairy location, great cast and is one om my favourite seasons i strongly recomend to buy this if you are a survivor fan like its great."
4,GREAT,"I'm a lover for SURVIVOR and never can wait until they put the next one out on DVD. Although I do think that CBS should put them out in order and not just pick a season out of order. I started watching survivor on season 4 so I would love for them to put out season 3. I have bought all of the survivor seasons and I'm sure other people have too, but we would like them in order (not that there is any order now) On top of everything else I LOVE SURVIVOR and can't wait to get this in the mail so I can start watching it."
4,One of the best in the series,"This season had many things going for it -- characters that were colorful (James, Coby), eye candy (Jenn), and ones you'd root for (Angie, Steph, Bobby Jon, Tom). Most of the cast were highly likeable or at least enjoyable to watch, except maybe for Jolanda and Wanda (thank goodness they left early). Some great challenges, many broken alliances, a one-man tribe, the longest immunity challenge ever and even a laid-down torch all make for pretty riveting stuff. Eminently watchable and rewatchable...only wish they could have done more in terms of the extra features; the 4 featurettes didn't really whet the appetite of what went on behind the scenes or even offer never-before-seen footage. That apart, it was worth the buy, better than pearl islands and slightly edging out the all-stars version. I'm buying Australia (The Outback) next, though I'd really like to get my hands on the Africa series. Wonder when CBS will release it."
5,Best Survivor Ever!,"This has got to be the best survivor ever! It was really great to ""relive"" the whole Palau experience again. And to see how amazingly good and strong Tom was. He deserved the title. Totally! The dvd has some pretty good extras as well especially the cast commentaries. Worth every cent!"
5,Survivor Palau,Watch the last Survivor that they put out on dvd! As well as two survivor's from this season that were just in the last one Heroes -vs- Villians...
2,Good for beginners,"I found this book to be useful when looking for general terms. However, if you are searching for very specific terms used in the legal profession or more recent terminology used, then one may want to opt for something else."
3,Spanish Law Dictionary/Diccionario De Terminos Juridicos,"I was disappointed on this dictionary. As a translator, I thought it would be a helpful tool for handling legal texts, but found it very basic and way too expensive for what it offers. It was explained to me that the hardcover makes it so pricey. In that case, it's worth waiting for the paperback version."
2,The Canary Islands Migration to Lousiana,"Same info with much much more available in Gilbert C Din's book ""The Canary Islanders of Louisiana"". Villere's book lacks a unified index for all migrants, indexing ship-by- ship only."
3,There are 2 version of this CD,"Sinnce the Il Divo is from Britain, be aware that this will be in PAL (Europe format) and it will not work on most U.S DVD player. They tend to put NTSC but it turned out to be PAL. It happened many times when the group is Europ-based."
4,An update on the career of Il Divo,"As a person who has all the DVD's, C.D.s and books so far produced by Il Divo and who has attended concerts on both of their World Tours and is looking forward to seeing them again, in Victoria in May, this DVD is very interesting, especially the documentary bringing us up to date on how the boys are still in the grip of all the potential of their future endeavors. Of course the music is always enjoyable - in The Promesa my favorite has to be the Halleluyah, I play it over and over."
5,great misic,We were delighted with this presentation. Someone sent us an email with video first and then we thought we must have it.
5,Spectacular,"The music was great, especially 'Amazing Grace' with the background and the bagpipe player. Although there were limited songs, the conversation with the singers was very interesting, since I had not heard Il Divo previously."
3,"Beautiful Venue, Not Much Music...","All my family members are Il Divo fans, and we have a great collection of their clearly fine music. Quite frankly, this DVD was a disappointment as it only contains five musical presentations. The remainder of the DVD is interviews and fillers.Save your money for Encore or one of their more complete live performances."
4,Satisfied Customer,"Although it took about 10 days to receive the item, the price was right and it was in new condition. Very satisfied. Thank you!"
2,not what the review said,"Ok...these guys have talent, But to make the statement ""Four of the greatest voices in the world"" is one of the biggest overstatements of all time. it would be comparable to saying the yugo was one of the greatest cars of all time. Its defineteley more about selling the magazine cologne ad type looks than it is actual talent."
3,"5 songs? Well, there is AMAZING GRACE!","I want the MUSIC - I don't care about all the interviews and such. I can go on-line and find those if I want them. Only 5 songs, as others have noted -- tremendously disappointing. Must note, however, that AMAZING GRACE almost (ALMOST!) makes this OK...As others have said, I won't buy another DVD of this group unless I know for SURE that I am getting an ENTIRE CONCERT (they did do more than 5 songs at Pula, Croatia... at least, I hope so...) Many will just watch the clips on YouTube instead... sad, but true -- and especially sad for Il Divo."
5,AWESOME ENTERTAINMENT,I CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF IL DIVO. I SAW THEM IN KC AND I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO STOP SINGING. I HAVE NEVER SEENA BAD DVD OR SONG FROM THEM. BRAVO!
2,"More talks than music, misleading title","I wish my wife had checked the most helpful review of this DVD before she ordered. Do NOT order this DVD if you thought it was the full concert at the Colisiem. Instead, there were only 5 selected songs.The title of the DVD is misleading. It should be ""The making of the promise"" because the majority of the DVD was about it. And, we really could not stay awake for that entire interview.For the misleading title, I think there was an unethical intent to sell more DVD's. Therefore, I give it a 2-star."
3,Amazing Grace is worth the purchase,"I purchased the DVD for the song Amazing Grace and was not disappointed in it. Although, it is the only song on the DVD that is in English."
5,GOT 2,WELL NOW THIS WAS A DOUBLE ORDER I BOUGHT ONE AND A FAMILY MEMBER ALSO BOUGHT ONE SO ONE WAS BROKE INSIDE AND IT GOT REALLY CONFUSING. BUT THERE GOOD. THEY WANT ORE WORDS BUT THERE JUST SO MUCH YOU CAN TYPE OUT AS I SAID ITS GOOD I RECOMMEND IT.
4,Very Peaceful,These guys singing are very heart pleasing and talented. The sound is excellent and feel good professional music. I recommend this to anyone that wants to sit or lay back and bring pease to their heart.
3,Very short DVD,When ordering I didn't see dvd and actually thought it was a cd.Any music they do is fantastic. Although a little short in length.
5,beautiful,"Yes, it is a short portion of a concert. But, I still have to recommend this DVD! I enjoy watching it before bed. It's a great way to let the day go and get wrapped up in the beautiful music. If you are into commentaries and want to know more about IL DIVO, then you are in luck. There is a great behind the scenes section where you can learn all about the artists."
1,Gigantic Rip Off!,"I purchased this DVD anticipating I would get at the very least, the audio files for Amazing Grace. GUESS WHAT? One cannot extract the audio from this video DVD. Also, Windows Media player would not play it at all advising it was the wrong code for the US. It will cost almost as much to send it back, if I can send it back,as the orignal purchase price. Il Divo is great music, but that is all I wanted, not a video DVD."
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this to have running during a party, wanted beautiful music. Talk talk talk but NO music.I want my money back. What a waste."
4,Beautiful music!,"This DVD concert is an experience in hearing impressive music sung by 4 gorgeous men in a beautiful historic setting. How can you beat that? I do wish there were more songs on DVD! I especially loved ""Amazing Grace""."
1,Poor quality,"I tried to play this CD in three different players.....it would not work. I returned it for another one and the same thing happened. Amazon then gave me a credit. Evidently there was a manufacturing flaw in this CD. Other CD's that I ordered were okay. Returning the ""bad"" CD was no problem.....Amazon was very helpful and it was easy to return the merchanise."
3,problem with ElDivo CD At the Coliseum,I have purchased two copies of this CD and I am very much a fan of El Divo. BOTH of these CD's do no start with the first song but jump to the third song on the album...Aleluya. I do not know why. This will play over and over and over and keep restarting back to the same song.What IS going ON??? Any ideas. I don't want to buy another one and I do like the arrangements on this CD even though I haven't been able to listen to it on the CD's that I have purchased. I did note that one reviewer stated that this CD was not formatted properly and I don't know what that means. Is is ME..MY Plyaer??...or do I need to try and order a third time?
2,Mixed Feelings,"Il Divo is an exceptionally talented group. But, this DVD is a disappointment as it only contains 5 pieces of music. The packaging appears to be a full concert, and there is no information in the ads to indicate that the presentation is so limited. The music is great, but I did expect more than 5 four minute songs with some fireworks in the background."
1,IL DIVO,I was not able to play the DVD since my player was not compatible with the European PAL. I do like the group and was disappointed that I could not play it.Don
4,"Something other than ""American Pie""","For those of you who are interested in venturing beyond the obvious, this album is one of his best and most consistant albums. While generally having a ""country"" feel, the songs are uniformly excellent. A wonderful and largely overlooked album."
4,Great film!,"I really enjoyed watching this film and was very impressed by its quality, especially considering that this is the director's first feature. I thought that this film gave an honest look at the hardships that life can throw at you and how God will help us through them no matter what. You won't regret watching this film. I'm looking forward to more movies from Kyle in the future."
3,Could Have Been A Lot Better,"The movie spends way, way, way too much dwelling on the father's bitterness and rejection of God. After 20 minutes of seeing the father bad-mouth God and religion, you're like, ""Ok, ok, I get it that he's mad at God! Now move on!"" This film would be better if it didn't spend so much time on this point. The acting and production quality are fairly good. Once the film finally picks up, it's not halfway bad at all--but it drags terribly until that point. You'll like the movie a lot more if you watch the first 15 minutes and then skip to the last 15 minutes. Literally, no kidding."
2,standing firm,"The movie was good, but the quality wasn't what I expected. there were several times in the movie that that it froze up on me."
2,Not Like I thought it would be,"This movie was just okay for me. It did not explain what you really need to do to be forgiven and to forgive. The son in the movie was the best actor of the whole movie. I just do not believe you can become a Christian by asking Jesus to come into your heart and be forgiven. There is more to it according to His word, The Bible. So, I was disappointed in this movie."
2,Standing Down,"Sorry to report this, but The trailer was better than the actual video. I love Christain movies, but this one is what I call the ""typical Baptist"" hit you on the head bible thumper movie. Need to take lessons from the producers of ""Fire Proof"", now they know how to make Christain movies. I want my money back."
4,Jesus changes lives!,"For a first time director, film writer this movie is quite good. I enjoyed watching the special features as much as the movie--really interesting. The movie deals with several relationships--each different and how people are changed with Jesus Chrst in their lives."
3,Good Chrstian movie,"The production quality of this movie isn't anything like ""Faith Like Potatoes"", but the message is very good nonetheless. I also purchased this movie for a mission trip to Managua, Nicaragua. We showed it to 25 teenaged girls living at an orphanage one evening. It was well received and the girls were totally into the movie, clapping at scenes and jubilent at the story's end. I would recommend this movie as a good Christian story that every one can relate to because we have all tried to witness to people who reject the message and us."
3,Standing Firm,Not good acting. Superficial. I do not recommend it.for anything with depth.. It mostly deals with human anger and resentment. Not inspiring .
4,Solid story,"The story line is good, it moves kinda slow, acting is good, but it has the typical ending, so there is no surprises."
5,Standing Firm,Standing firm is an excellent movie.The father who didn't want to hear about god. found what he had been missing and has so much more now.
2,Slow with an unclear Gospel message,"An amateur production with a slow storyline made this film hard to finish. Watched it with unsaved family and I was equally disappointed in the lack of clarity in what was supposed to be a Gospel message and absence of scripture. Could have been a powerful tool (as the cover claims) but in the end is a sluggish feel good story about anger, loss, and regret."
2,A slow moving film about a man who turned to Christ,"I bought a bunch of Christian movies recently, but this is one of the slow moving ones. Though it is slow moving, it is believable. It addresses the fact that bad things happen to good people, and that we do go through difficulty in life, but that does not mean that God does not love us nor does it mean that God does not care. It talks about a man who lost his wife, and his journey to knowing the Lord. I personally did not like the abrupt ending."
5,Awesome movie!!,This movie had a story that most people can relate to. God was lifted up and honored in this movie.
3,Was expecting a little bit more from this DVD.,"This DVD was good, but not enough in the way it ended. Was expecting more miracles...or something. This movie could have a part II later on...What happened later on in their lives? What more has God done in their lives. It was worth watching, but ended to quickly. What did they do with finding God in their lives, how did they serve God in the future? They found God, just like the (mom,wife) wanted them to, but show more on how they served God, God's miracles in their lives,and how they helped others."
4,So far so good,"This cutter is heavy and solid, and so far it has worked like a charm. This is one of the better ones I have owned and well worth the price, in fact it is worth much more."
5,Mysterious and wonderful...,"This was my second Tarot deck I purchased 'way back in 1986. 1st was Rider-Waite. The major Arcana are done in perfect ""art nouveau"" style. All of the cards have upright and reversed meanings printed on them. This is very significant in the history of the Tarot! The actual meanings date from 1783 from Etiella himself. Roughly translated, of course. No other deck printed in 1981 carried these associations, making it a breakthrough for readers of any time! The minors are not illustrated and possibly come from an earlier Italian deck.The backs have always intrigued me: colored red and gold with a zodiac wheel, a running deer, and the word ""Modiano"" printed on it. I like the astrological references on the majors and each minor has a time frame on them. Perfect for a ""Fortune teller"" at any level. I never use the deck for readings. In fact, a came across one in celophane and keep like new. This is a serious collector deck, and it shall forever remain near and dear to my heart!"
4,Well made and absorbing,"This movie has an absorbing plot, is crisply directed and features an outstanding cast. It is well worth the attention of any Western fan.Director Hathaway keeps the tension building and creates several gripping plot turns that put the lives of the heroes in doubt if the outlaw gang find out what they're trying to do to get free. He and the cinematographer create a world of dust, set against a majestic mountain backdrop while making the interior action edgy and teetering close to violence.The cast is exceptional, with Hayward stealing all her scenes from the other actors, although Power and Marlowe are good in their parts. Elam is deliciously over the top as a leering crazy and the performances of Jagger and Buchanan add nicely to the way the story is delivered.The dry as dust last two lines of dialogue beautifully round off a well made, classy film."
1,surprisingly disappointing,"I sure was expecting more from a Lonely Planet publication. As other reviewers wrote--most of these stories were boring and not well written. I gave it one shining star for the story by Ryan Ver Berkmoes! He wrote an interesting story with a few snide remarks scattered thru-out. His was the only story, really, fun to read."
5,Very informative and well laid out,Easy to read and easy to follow! I really enjoyed this book and use it as a resource regularly
5,Read again and again!,"Richard Raffan's books are just excellent. I have 3 of his books now, including 'Turning Bowls', and I am constantly re-reading them. I'll always get something new to ponder - from wood choices to turning techniques, from his explanations of 'good' shapes to his feelings for natural finishes. It is refreshing that he has been doing this for almost 40 years and really encouraging for him to say that he has made some items that he won't even show people! Highly recommended as a book that every wood turner should have."
5,Excellent resource for woodturners,"Richard Raffan books and dvd's are an excellent resource to have in your collection. I began turning wood about 3 years ago. The information contained inside Raffan's books and dvd's definitely help to shorten the learning curve. However, the best way to shorten the learning curve is to practice turning, Raffan's information helps you learn proper technique."
5,Great resource,"Great book, so great I gave mine to a friend and now have to buy it again. This book shows many cuts and techniques that turners need to understand turning bowls.Recommended for any personal or club library."
1,Worst Trimmer I ever Tried,"This item should never be sold, it does not cut anything, a waste of money. I have tried it as well as the rest of my family and it did not work for anyone."
3,"Good, not great but good","The trimmer does what it is supposed to do, but you really have to work to make any significant progress with small nose hairs."
1,This item is a piece of crap!!!,"It vibrates, it uses electricity BUT it is a piece of crap; it is completely useless and I will continue to buy another Wohl product...it works but I can't find it because it is always used and I forget where I put it. James Roossien"
3,Tea Bags,Flavor a little faint. Could be stronger for my taste. Probably won't purchase this product again.
5,For advanced users only...,This is just the same as any older edition of Que Publishing's Upgrading Your PC just with Norton as a contribuiter and the TechTV logo on it.
4,A thought provoking story for all ages,"A wonderful story for both children and adults about the workings of karma. Rich merchant Pandu learns that when he harms others, harm will eventually come to him.Lovely color illustrations.The only minor distraction from an othewise fine book, is that the placement of the bilingual text is often awkward."
3,Test Your Surface Before Using --go slowly...,For the right situation this product works okay. Unfortunately if you apply it to the wrong surface you can have quite a problem. Always test a small area of any furniture or wood floor first. Spray it on the cloth not the surface. For many older wood surfaces that have been heavily waxed over the years this product can cloud the finish. You will see an immediate white haze on the surface if its going to react with the finish. I would not recommend using this on any valuable piece of wood furniture. The clouding is not easy to remove. There are several stories on the Internet with people struggling to fix this problem. Several sites recommend never using this product on their floors as it will destroy the finish over the years. So check with the manufacturer. Remember this product is using water and vegetable oil to clean wood. The water quickly evaporates and your left with vegetable oil on the wood. I would recommend proceeding with caution.
3,Careful with laminate flooring!,"I bought this product specifically for my laminate flooring which I have throughout my entire house. I used it according to the directions. Found the citronella smell a little to strong. I liked the fact that it did not create an oily, slippery film on my floors. What I discovered, though, was that if you walk barefoot a lot, your feet will visibly imprint on the surface so after a week, you can see tons of marks everywhere, especially where there is light coming from the window. To me, such prints are just as bad as crumbs on a carpet. I initially thought that it was just the type of laminate flooring I had, but once I switched to one of those Swiffer mops, the problem completely went away and now I do not need to re-mop my floor more than once a month!"
3,A Short Novel of Monster Horror,"A small scientific expedition searching for the lost treasure of King John finds more than they bargained for. buried in the mud of tidal flats they find strange pieces of metal and then a green-scaled humanoid creature that is miraculously alive.That night the creature stirs and begins a murderous rampage of killing and devouring some of the locals. The locals think the expedition is responsible and target them for a hanging party.Soon even the military is involved in trying to stop the beast but their weapons are powerless.Is the creature from outer space newly arrived on a meteor, or is it a legendary protector of the treasure? You will have to read to find out.One of the earlier efforts from the author. Reminiscent of the Crabs books or Abomination. A fun quick read for fans of his brand of horror."
5,Daniel Odonnel,Anything with Daniel odonnel is just wonderful and you can listen to him for ever his voice is just a dream. thank you
4,This book is a medley of scholarship and spiritual reading.,"In this text, the author attempts to read Hopkins' poems as prayers, the fruit of his relationship with God. His hope is that the reader will understand Hopkins' spirituality as well as his poetic sensibility. When read with the poems, the text also serves as personal spiritual reading."
2,board is ok... darts are HORRIBLE,"Plain and simple... the darts included with the Halex Zeta are HORRIBLE! You have to assemble the darts which are a clue right there. The wings or the top part which are the ""feathers"" on real darts is this plastic inserted piece. Expect that if your dart doesn't stick on the board(which is the majority of the time), it will fall to the floor and the top will fall off. So all in all... I threw 18 darts... only about 4 stuck... the rest fell to the floor... and of those, all but 2 had to have the top put back on(which is a pain)... and I even had to look for the top to 3 of these which flung off somewhere! Poorly made darts that don't stay on the board. Perfect example of ""You get what you pay for""."
3,Coffee Table Picture Book,"This is not a book about cars; it is an excercise in photography. If you are looking to read about the cars, you will be extremely dissapointed. Other than a tag stating the car model and year, there is no text whatsoever on pages with photos. Tiny capsule captions for each photo are found at the end of the book. The photos are exquisite, but they are all studio shots; none show the cars in their natural surroundings. Most of the photos are only postcard size. Those that are larger run across the center gutter due to the portrait page orientation. A lot of the photo is lost in the gutter. For those that want beautiful photos along with some historical background of the car and manufacturer, I recommend books by Dennis Adler."
2,Nice photos lost in the binding.,"I saw a review for this book in one of the classic car magazines and ordered the book. I myself produce a cable tv program. One of the vehicles that we featured was the Stout Scarab, the cover vehicle for this book. When the book arrived I was very dissappointed that almost 10 percent of every automobile photo was lost in the binding of the book. If ever there was a need for fold out pages or a wider format this was it. Though the photos are beautiful, so much is lost that in the whole it is painful to look at. I returned the book.Charles Derer"
3,It's OK,"Beautiful photos of cars, and many details like hood ornaments. But why print photos over two pages, over and over again, in all such books?I bought it (in a Dutch translation) because it wasn't expensive - about $16. That doesn't compare well to the price asked here.It's still available at one of our well-known bookshops that sells publishers' leftovers..."
3,Slightly disappointed,"This book has some very good pictures from the Victorian period in it. It was originally published in 1877, this version is a modern reprint. What I was disappointed in, though, were how few photographs are actually here, considering the title: ""Victorian London Street Life in Historic Photographs"". In fact, there is only a photo on every 3rd or 4th page, the rest of the book being text. While I was not necessarily looking for a picture book, I did expect photos to dominate, perhaps with captions or some brief supporting text. As it is, this is a 134 page book with only 36 photos. Thus, I give it only 3 stars, as I feel the title is a bit deceptive."
4,Good information,"Very informative about the period. Good photos. My friend, who was writing a Victorian era novella, was pleased with the gift."
2,Not at all what I wanted,"I bought this book for the photographs of Victorian London street people. However, the photos are relatively few and separated by very long, wordy descriptions which I doubt I'll ever read. It said ""in Historic Photographs,"" not ""with boring commentary."" Didn't get what was advertised nor did I get what I paid for."
5,Buy this Book!,I reccomend this book without reservation! This book is an outstanding handbook for women who wish to develop thier relationship skills and sexual magentism. Ginie Sayles teaches women how to package themselves for relationships and gives basic relationship guidelines.
5,Psychedelic Beauty,"On saturday december 11, 2004 we saw Memphis playing at Rothko (new york lower east side bar) and it was amazing, a wonderful performance filled with colors and sounds. It reminds me of bands such as Sigur Ros or Clinic but Memphis has their own nature, some sort of psychedelic beauty. Check it out (^_^) !"
3,This is no Stars!!,"Torquil's Memphis's I Dreamed we Fell Apart starts off great with Second Summer, in true Stars mode. After that there are two nice songs For Anyone 18 and Into the Wild that blend well together. After that things seem to veer into a monotonous swirl of sounds that are really not all that interesting. It doesn't pick up again until the track ""Nada"" and their rendition of the Pet Shop Boys ""Love comes Quickly"" comes and saves it from me never playing this cd again. In summary there are some great things about this CD but not enough to save it from going in my CD storage box for the next 2 years until I re-sell it."
4,A product to look at.,"Quality product. Heavy duty, well made and strong. Could be about 1/8"" wider before the sides start to curve up."
2,Nothing Special,"We received this game as a gift. I remember it from my childhood but I don't remember playing it.Well, I wasn't missing anything. I played it with my 2 and 4 year old and it was easy for both to grasp the concept. We played for about ten minutes and then put it away - no one had won yet. Past the initial fun of putting ten cherries on our trees there wasn't much else to it. None of us got anymore than four cherries off our tree before we had to put them back because of the bird, dog or empty basket direction on the spinner. We kept taking them off then putting then back on (the objective is to have all your cherries off your tree and in your basket first). That's the game.We have so many other very fun games like Animal Bingo, Busytown, Eeboo Picnic Game, Zingo, Spot It, Sequence, even Dominos and Go Fish are lots more fun (just to give you an example of what we do like). I would not waste my money on this."
2,"cute, but just too small","I bought it for my 7 inch Toshiba DVD player. it only has one pocket and the room is very limited. the quantity is good though, and it's stylish.Also the straps to hand it on car seats are too difficult to use. The installation is messy and the locks are almost impossible to operate so inflexible they are."
1,product is misleading,This is not the same product as advertised. The case shown is black with a grey stripe down the middle and also has a port to connect two sets of headphones by the carrying handle. However i recieved an all black case with no port for any headphones. I had to contact the seller since this item is not fulfilled by amazon. Upon contacting ebags i was sent another dvd bag and it was the wrong item as well! If you are looking for the double headphone feature in a dvd case this is NOT the case you want. its just a standard case. if you want just a standard case do not but this one because there are some much cheaper that this one. I am very dissapointed in the false advertisement.
3,Key-guide,"Uma chave de identificao simples e informativa em formato encadernado.Merecia uma reviso (1886, 1991), mas o bom é que traz alguns termos técnicos usualmente utilizados para quem está comeando a identificao de crnios e mandíbulas se familiarizar.Atende ao que foi proposto."
4,Intrigue and skulls!,"This is a great read! Beckman's been moved into a temporary assignment, then they dig up a skull at the amusement park! Gil's former partner asks him to look into a missing person who is an employee. This page turner mystery has many twists and turns not unlike an amusement park ride!"
3,A feminist and postmodern perspective,"The book is tight, however, it is an overwhelming barage of self-interest and personal agrandizment within the discipline. In contrast to other ethonographies, Fingure is more of a venue ethnography; Nelson uses the book to further her own persona, beliefs and character in the true postmodern spirit. Between the brash jokes (although they relflect reality) and impressive vocabulary emerges a theme of ethnographer as ""superwoman"". This theme made me wonder if Nelson was being extreme with intent to show me that she could transcend ideological gender boundaries that exist within anthropology. Although Nelson effectively provides deep insight into Guatemala and indigenous affairs there, she interjected to much ""I"" into the work. Those looking for a postmodernist view of Guatemalan idigenous affairs would enjoy this book. Those searching for an objective view should refer to another piece."
4,Good switch,The switch works good. It wa easy to install. Only issue is that the illumination could be a tad but brighter.. But overall - very nice
3,Good for starters,"It's alright book to get some info from but written with care and feeding contridicitions thru it. I wouldnn't pick exclusively for the beardie care, but useful pairing with other books for info."
3,"Good, but scholarship gets in the music's way","Moroney's scholarship and competence are undoubted, and his treatment of the Art of the Fugue is musical and never boring - but never attractive either. His fiddling of the order of the fugues/canons is gratuitous (in spite of his close-minded arguments), and his own completion of the final fugue is abrupt. Generally, he's too dogmatic; he has a point to prove and Bach had better not get in his way."
1,still waiting,I never recieved this product so I'm not happy since I've been waiting several weeks and still waiting
4,It fit. It works!,"Oster's instructions were difficult to read, but the blade itself is excellent. It was easy to find in Amazon's search engine and the vendor got the item to us promptly and in excellent condition. It was the correct blade and it works."
3,One 20.5 oz. bottle,"Description says this is 11 oz. bottle x 2. Actually received ONE 20.5oz. bottle.Not a big difference, unless you were hoping to keep half of it fresher longer"
1,"Good ideas, but","The ideas in the book I found interesting, but that could not make me forgot about how it was written. I am not sure wether to kick the author or the editor - or perhaps both for doing such a shoddy job. I am not going to bore you with the mistakes, let it suffice that there are too many to make the book really interesting or really reliable. If someone is looking for information and ends up reading this they are worse off than before. This is only interesting to people who know the background already - but then, why would you bother reading something if you already knwo the contents.This could have done with a good editor to make it readable."
5,Reveals historical truths behind common myths,"Readers of The Da Vinci Code who want more to contemplate will benefit from medieval scholar Sharan Newman's special expertise in The Real History Behind The Da Vinci Code: a guide which asks questions and reveals historical truths behind common myths. From the conspiracy to downplay the human and sexual sides of Jesus to the workings of the Opus Dei Awareness Network, or ODAN, The Real History Behind The Da Vinci Code probes many religious questions from the original bestseller."
5,Museums 101,"This is a text book on museum science. It covers all phases of designing, building, financing and operating a museum from the very basics. I have used it extensively to develop policies and procedures for the Minnesota Transportation Museum as we grow from a trolley ride to a major museum site. Everyone in the museum/history center/science center business should read this and see that other members of the trustees and employees have read this as well. Most valuable is the discussion of the responsibilities of the board of trustees, executive director, curator and other employees. Though the book is small, it gives you a good foundtation to build upon for any phase of museum work."
1,Introduction to Museum Work,I ordered this book on line through Amazon.com and as of now have not received the book. Your help in expediting the delivery of this book to me would be appreciated.
2,DVD 101,"This work of Godard is a grandiose masterpiece. It's a sure thing, no doubt about it, IT MUST BE SEEN, it's a 10 out of 10.But, this DVD edition forget one thing: some people don't need any subtitles, some people are french or speak french. So let's them the choice to watch this masterpiece without subtitles! I was so upset when I realize the subtitles were ""obligatory"". DVD 101: the choice for the spectator to watch with or without subtitles.Then, it's really the minimum. But anyway, Histoire(s) du Cinéma is a monument, so it doesn't really matter if there is not supplements."
1,Insult to Irish Music!!!!!!!!!!,"These ""songs"" by ""Andy"" bring down the level of quality one can usually expect from traditional Irish songs. His Country-Western, drone-style of singing even put our ultra-hyper cat, Spencer, to sleep. Really, the songs sound quite ridiculous. What in the world is a country singer doing singing Irish songs? The southern ""twang"" demystifies the beauty of traditional Irish ballads."
4,Just what I ordered (from Amazon),I really didn't know if I could find this product at Amazon. But to my surprise - I did. I have used this product and it was just what I ordered and wanted. I'll buy it again when needed. Thank you.
2,no scent,it really didn't have much scent. so if you are buying it because you like the scent of lavender don't get your hopes up.
3,Works great but the enamel comes off over time,"This is very useful and I do enjoy having it in my car, but am a bit disappointed the enamel eventually wares off."
5,Great Tool....,"This is a great little tool for anyone who does electrical work. I like it better than the Micra it's replacing. With this tool, you don't have to open it up to get to the knife or screwdrivers. It makes things alot easier to do. I highly recommend this Leatherman to anyone...."
2,Tweezer problem,"I received this multi tool and it seemed very useful at first.HOWEVER, there are tweezers that at least for me were a nightmare to remove and impossible to reinsert.I could not find specific instructions on use of the tweezers on the enclosed papers.The tweezers are held in a plastic piece with a slot for the tweezers that rotates out (and then in).I wish I had never used the tweezers so I could keep this multi tool but since I cannot reinsert this sheet and tweezers I have to return this tool."
1,misrepresented the quality and condition of book.,"Suposed to be a hard cover, ""like new"", but I received a paperback with highlighting throughout the book, in every chapter. I don't buy books like that.Seller was nasty about it, blamed me and Amazon for misrepresentation.I would not reccomend doing business to a seller who is nasty, rather than helpfull. He did offer me a refund, but I would have to pay shipping,and his ""fee"", leaving $3.00 refund to me. Not worth the time, nor should I pay for his misleading false description.Seller harrased me until I demanded he stop.This was my first bad experience with a book seller. I find most want to accomadate the buyer and are appolagetic. Not this seller."
2,Disappointing,"The general tips on the business are good, but this book was written during a very different time in the antiques business. A lot of the what is discussed is out of date and does not apply to today's market. The manner in which the information is presented is annoying because the book is written by Sara Pitzer, but the knowledge of the business comes from Don Cline. Pitzer ends up saying ""Don says this..."" and ""Don tried that..."" and so on. Very annoying."
3,"Great Treats, but they arrive broken (what a waste)","My dogs are addicted to these treats. I often give them after doing unpleasant things to my dogs (nail clipping, ear wash, etc)... and they're so crazy about the treats that they actually ask to be clipped so they can get one.On the down side, my last two orders of these have arrived pretty pulverized, and I'm running out of patience (with no one to complain to except you. Sorry about that part.)"
4,"Good, quality ingredients with great flavor","I feel good about the quality ingredients, especially after I read a warning on another pack of ""all natural"" treats from China telling people to wash their hands carefully after handling the product. OMG!! Anyway - good, quality ingredients with a great flavor. I gave only a 4 star rating because I was a bit disappointed to see that they were made in Canada instead of the US."
5,Wonderful dog treats!,"I've been feeding Paul Newman dog treats (and dry and canned food too) to my dog for many years. Read the ingredients - all great quality ingredients in there. I recently moved to the midwest and haven't been able to find it and rather than switch to another brand, I decided to order it on Amazon. I refuse to buy dog food from companies that test their products on animals confined to cages in laboratories which many do. Paul Newman's doesn't do that. Nor do they add ingredients from animal processing plants. They also give their proceeds to charities to help people and animals."
5,my dog loves um,"I am tired of junk food dog treats. I dont want artificial colors, flavors, dyes, corn. I love subscribe and save from Amazon, great idea. My first shipment arrived today. My dog was very curious about the box, couldnt quit smelling it. I opened one bag, she was very excited. Yum, she loves them. Healthy ingredient list. Good product."
1,Disappointment,I actually thought this would be a real how to book on making Baltimore Album quilts instead of a chat session on the author's experiences doing the same.
4,The Making of a Baltimore Album Quilt,This book has excellent suggestions and details on making a Baltimore Album quilt. It arrived promptly and in excellent condition.
5,Tastes great,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried. As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either. Below is the main nutritional info:Calories 180Total Fat 5gSat fat 2gSodium 250mgCarbs 30gFIBER 6gPROTEIN 9g"
3,PRICED WAY TOO HIGH - SAM'S CLUB HAS THE BEST!,PRICED WAY TOO HIGH - SAM'S CLUB HAS THE BEST PRICE. THOUGHT AMAZON SELLER WAS COMPETITIVE AND THAT IS NOT THE CASE.
1,Stale.,"I am a BIG fan of the Kashi GOLEAN Crunch bars. They are filling, nutritious and tasty. Since I eat one everyday for breakfast, I thought I would venture online to try to get a better deal than at the grocery store. The best deal I found (including shipping cost) was here at Amazon, so I ordered them. Of course the next day I happen to be at the grocery store and notice that the very same bars are ON SALE and cost $0.99 each!! I bought them all! Then a few days later my Amazon shipment arrived. Every bar tastes a little stale and the chocolate coating has been melted off into the wrapper. While I am sure they aren't expired or dangerous to eat, there just isn't the same crunch and chocolatey flavor that I love so much. I will not be ordering them from Amazon again. I prefer to take my chances on getting sale prices at the Grocery!"
5,X-acto knife blades,"These are good quality #11 X-acto like knife blades. Good price, good delivery, what else can I say"
5,Very Good!,"I'm not usually fond of foreign films with subtitles at the bottom. I find them to hard to follow, when you have to read the subtitles plus look at the picture. But this one was easy to follow and was a sweet story. If you love music, you will love this film."
5,More than adequate!,"I feared this film might be trite or, worse yet, too cute. Fortunately, it avoided those pitfalls, which almost surely a British version would not. The French style of realism and honesty made for a more complex, true-to-life film, one that ends well but without the burden of a ""perfect happy ending"". At a few places I found it a little difficult to keep track of the characters, and perhaps the school director was too selfishly evil, but not enough to ruin the story of an unlikely hero inspiring ordinary kids to be more. It's a very good film!"
4,Le Choriste or The Chorus,"Loved this movie! Highly recommend. However, hope you don't mind sub titles! The film is French and good family film."
1,English?,"I haven't seen this movie yet. Does it have English subtitles? I don't speak French. The only experience I have with this film is that I would like to see it, but I will not buy it if it does not have English subs."
3,Problem with the case,"I was happy the film came earlier than expected, but the DVD case was damaged. The plastic cover was morphed and ripping off. Other than that, everything was fine."
3,Sing Out Loud,"""The Chorus"" is a nice little movie about one man's, Clement Mathieu (Gerard Jugnot) attempts to bring some culture, music, art and a touch of civility to a group of young, ruffian boys in post war France, circa 1949.There is nothing particularly profound in what director Christophe Barratier has to say except: treat people with respect and they will, in turn, act in a respectful manner; which is important, particularly for children but not especially earth-shaking.""The Chorus"" verges on the maudlin and the overly sanctimonious at times but Barratier manages to stay clear of jumping off the cliff onto sentimentality.What is most interesting about this film is that France chose to enter it in the Oscar Best Foreign Film race. With so many (particularly ""Intimate Strangers"" and ""Feux Rouges"") notable films made in France in 2004, why this film?""The Chorus"" is pleasant, nice even but the best French film of 2004? I think not."
2,Sentimental and unreal,"I hate to rain on everybody else's parade, but I found this film to be false and cloying. Jugnot's acting is the saving grace....well, I suppose the intentions were good. Kindness and sweet music are indeed to be preferred to cruelty and ugliness. I only wish they had made a good film out of these noble sentiments.The much-praised musical sequences fell harshly on these professional musician's ears.This film was an enormous success in France, running counter to a strong vein of cynical pessimism in that country's culture."
5,One of the best movies ever!,"Fact is that this is a truly incredible, moving film.I am not a fan of European movies, however, this movie is extremely well done. Is never boring, it is sentimentally rich and the music is fantastic.It is certainly not a new topic: The music teacher that changes the lives of bad students. We have seen that with Mr. Holland Opus or Sister Act. But the truth is that this movie makes the others so secondary, that you really have to see it yourself. I saw it today while on vacation in Mexico city and decided to order the DVD immediately."
4,Good idea; no resolve,"I watched this film because of its Oscar nom, despite lulewarm reviews. There is certainly a lot of pathos involved, and I was more reminded of ""Dead Poet's Society"" than others mentioned in previous reviews. Music is always a terrific reliever of tension. I would like to think that justice was done, if this is, indeed, a true story. There are ugly moments throughout, and a few glorious moments that can make a simple mind like mine think that perfection could really happen, under the circumstances. ""Les Choristes"" is unrealistic in too many ways, but it's a good story; I wish our troubled children, way too many, could understand the power of music, and realize that the world ain't so bad...Music is INDEED a powerful life entity."
5,I love this movie...,"During the school year my honors french class watched this film, but I ended up falling asleep (a lot like most of the other students).About a week ago, after reading all the great reviews that ""Les Choristes"" recieved on this site, i decided to call my french teacher up and borrow the movie from her. I've watched it about 6 times since then lol; i love it. The story is very appealing, and at points very very funny. If you're a singer, like me, you'll definently love this movie, the singing is truly incredible and give you a huge appreciation for the beauty of the french language. Jean Baptiste Maunier (Pierre Morhange) is really gifted, his singing gave me the chills (especially the high note at the end of ""Caresse Sur L'Océan""), the rest of the cast is also great.I highly recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites & will be in my collection for a long long time."
5,"loved it, loved it, loved it.","Wow! If you are a teacher or planning on becoming a teacher, watch this movie -- like chicken soup for the teachers soul."
5,A Must Buy,"If you live in an area where this movie is not showing in theaters, you'll have to wait for May 3rd to purchase the DVD. $20 may sound like an investment without even having seen it. However, it is worth every penny! I do not know anyone who has seen this movie who was not profoundly moved by it. Many describe it as ""the best movie (they) have ever seen"" and even saw it several times at the theater.The plot is universal and profoundly touching: it is about childhood, happiness and sacrifice for the good of others. Think about ""Dead Poets Society"" with a music teacher and a surprising twist at the end, which will leave you open-mouthed on your seat long after the credits have finished rolling. The music is the most beautiful piece I have ever heard, even though I am not a choir music fan.It is not because it is a French movie that it has to be intellectual and boring. Buy it, watch it, pass the word around!"
4,so cute and soft.,"my son loves this whale as well as the 12 inch they offer. my only issue is that he loves them to death! literally! with all the kissing and hugging and sitting upon they endure i would say they do quite well, but i have had to sew the big one about 4 times in the past two months and i am sure i will be sewing this one soon. it is machine washable, they do not recommend it but with my son in diapers and accidents and his love of chewing on its flippers, i had no other option. i would recommend this for any whale loving child!"
3,Recirculating Charcoal Filter,The filter works but fits a bit loose so when the fan is turned on the filter clanks as it is lifted by the force of the air. Same thing happens when the fan is turned off. Other than that it works fine. There was no problem with the delivery nor the packaging. It came in perfect condition.
2,Meets the need but grossly overpriced.,"The GE microwave filter is a VERY SIMPLE charcoal filter, SMALL, and should cost $1-2 tops, certainly nowhere near the $20 most are selling it for. Since it is so simple, I'm sure it will work fine.GE JX81J Microwave Recirculating Charcoal Filter Kit"
3,filters,"the filters were fine, just the wrong size.. I don't know if GE gave me the wrong part number again or if its something else."
4,It works,"It works but a little over priced. It was very easy to remove the cover, the filter fit perfectly, and easy to put the cover back on."
1,Wrong filter,"The service for the return was great.Appliance company changed the filter type in newer models, but not in the manual that came with."
4,Fender Strobe E Keychain Turner Candy Apple Red,"This was for my son, so I really know nothing about it, but he seems to be happy with it."
2,not much use,"I purchased this for a teenager who recently got a guitar...and at the same time she got her driver's license. I thought this was pretty creative of me but.. because she already had a tuner and doesn't even use that, this item was of no use to her. I don't even think she used it as a key ring. It is pretty cool looking but for some, it's not that essential. If someone doesn't have a tuner already this could be of some use to them."
5,"A lot more fun than watching ""Law and Order""","A real-life trial, with an exasperated and somewhat ineffectual prosecutor, an interesting defendant - and world revolution as the topic. Ever wonder whether communists aim to kill individual capitalists? How can you be a socialist if the majority of working people today don't agree they need socialism? Why take away the property of the wealthy that they have obtained by legal means? James P. Cannon answered each one of these questions, and many more, in his 1941 trial on charges of sedition. A wonderful, easy-to-read guide for anyone trying to understand Marxism. Excellent for high school students."
4,One per pack,It fits 97-01 jeep cherokee. The other reviews said it comes in a 10 pack.?.?. I got one gasket in the envelope in the mail box.
5,NOT disappointed!!,Great quality! has self-stick peel adhesive on one side. Got it super cheap and quick with free ship in conjunction to other parts orderer at the same time. Amazon is the best place to buy quality auto parts!
5,"Fun, fun, fun for kids","Both my kids (7 yrs old and 2 yrs old) were fascinated with the video. They loved the songs and monsters in the story. In fact, they replay the songs quite a bit. The video was challenging but not too difficult for my 7 year-old, who already understands and can speak some Korean. Glad to see that there is a new, innovative Korean language product available for kids."
1,Not exactly what I expected!,"I read Stuart Nicholson's article in the New York Times about European vs. American jazz and bought several albums he recommended, including this one by Michael Moore et al. Best thing about it is the cool silver and green cover! I like to think I am open to new musical forms, but this one I found unappealing in the extreme: percussion, mixing, more style than content. Nils Petter Molvaer I found more accessible (""Khmer""). See the replies in the Letters section of the Times, 6/17/01 for other perspectives."
4,"definitely helps with leaves, but not perfect","This grate helps with the problem of leaves and other organic debris blocking the flow of water. Even with this atruim grate you will still need to check your yard inlets for major blockages weekly if you have lots of trees. The plastic that makes up these grates is somewhat thinner than I would hope for, but they are still worth the price."
3,Maybe I'm just a different kind of webmaster...,"But I haven't found this book to be nearly as useful as I had hoped to after reading all these glowing reviews. My biggest problem with it is the lack of a simple Apache section governing all the real-world mods you might have to do on a regular basis. NOTHING in the book on, for instance, implementing SSL via .htaccess. In fact, it's because of the lack of treatment on SSL that I have to give this thing three stars. The CGI section is useful, the XML stuff is nice, the JavaScript reference is very valuable. But I have to say that without a comprehensive section on implementing SSL, this isn't a ""real-world-ready"" reference."
3,"Good, but not great","I am an information architect who was looking for a desktop reference to provide some technical support for my job. I own many books by O'Reilly and was anxious to recieve this book. However, in the section on servers there is NO REFERENCE to Microsoft IIS. How could they leave out one of the most popular server titles????"
4,Webmaster in a nutshell,This is a required book for web programming. It's easy to use as a guideline.
5,perfect!,Just what I wanted at a great price. Arrived quickly. Brand new in packaging and couldn't ask for anything more.
5,Wonderful workout,"This is a great workout. I am a beginner and after just a few weeks, I already feel the difference. Thanks Mr Gym."
2,Year of thr Hyeneas,"This is a mediocre read - a simplistic who done it. The setting is Egypt during the reign of Ramses III. The historical background is incredibly elementary. I found the characters shallow, chatty and vociferous - saying nothing of substance. Being an optimist, I started book two in the trilogy. Note the word ""started."" If you favor historical fiction set in Egypt look elsewhere!"
3,disappointing,"After reading Nefertiti.. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I just couldn't get into it.. I am sure that it was written well and researched well, but I guess it was not the book I was looking to read."
5,Very Enjoyable,I highly recommend this book if you like historical fiction. I read a lot of mysteries and this one is a keeper. I am looking forward to reading the second book in this series.
3,"Good, but not the best","Yes, the Axis A and the X series pedals are very good,these are sturdy and reliable pedals. I played the Axis A-Double Basspedal for about 5 years.I never liked chain or strapdrive so I used Axis pedals, mainly due to their direct drive linkage. There are not many direct drive pedals on the market. The Axis is one of the few and up to now has been the best of its kind. But things have changed. Now there is Pearls Demon Drive pedal. The Pearl is far superior to the Axis. I sold my Axis doublepedal in order to get Pearls Demon Drive."
5,Un diccionario muy bueno,Este diccionario es muy conciso y preciso. Empleo este diccionario en mis clases de espanol porque la profesora no permite ningun otro. Las definiciones son ideales para los estudiantes.
2,William King needs to learn how to end a book,"The book itself was ok - I really liked the interaction between Ragnar and Sven, but damn, the ending just came up and hit you. It was like someone told him to stop the book at page 288 and when he hit it, he just ended the book.The whole premise to the story is ""how did Ragnar become a wolflord without first becoming a Grey Hunter."" Did he tell you this? No. There was a fairly lame plot device (like you'd see in a RPG) to get some action in, but there was little to none plot resolution at the end.I was really hoping King would improve on his endings from his Gotrek and Felix stories, but in fact, he's getting worse. If you liked the first two books, you'll probably like this one, but I cannot highly recommend it."
5,Unsurpassed! See last version's reviews for more accurate ratings,"This is the best, easiest to use, most complete, thoroughly detailed reference for a student or practitioner. Simply outstanding if you need to access practical details quickly or compare medications in the same class."
4,Clinical Handbook of Psychotropic Drugs,"I have purchased this book in preparation for future use. I have no feedback on the actual book yet, though the purchase process was fine, no problems...."
1,Inacurate and Unfair!,"Though well researched and well written, the author accepts rumour as facts, and thus published reports of personal misconduct which are totally false. It does not do justice to the tragic story of the collapse of the fortunes of a family that was world reknowed for their kindness and generosity. For those that were acquainted with the true facts, and recognize the Reichmans as the great men that they truly are, this book is a travesty."
5,Easy to Read,"The illuminations accompanying Blake's poetry should be considered necessary to the reading of his poems. The illuminations are beautiful, descriptive, obviously terribly time consuming and should not be counted as something separate from the words. That said, sometimes it is difficult to read the poems on the illuminations, as they were meant to be read. This book provides the complete illuminations followed by the poems sans illumination, for ease of reading. Also, the price is of course outstanding, as illuminated versions of Blake's poetry can get quite pricey."
5,inspirational,"I have enough background now to think I understand the major controversies facing the English when William Blake wrote this book. I still find some lines shocking. Plate 21 picks on Swedenborg for boasting ""that what he writes is new."" As Blake pointed out: ""he shews the folly of churches and exposes hypocrites, till he imagines that all are religious, & himself the single one that ever broke a net."" Social systems that rely on doctrines don't have much staying power in a world in which the future keeps getting snatched away from those with superficial opinions. If this book is frightening for some, it has stood the test of time since 1794 and might last longer than what we think of it."
2,CELTIC HORIZONS Phil Coulter,The first time I have ever had one of Phil Coulter's that I did not like. It was not that it was not probably good. I just did not care for it.
3,Strichen At War,"It is intriquing to see the development of Christopher Phillips as an author through the eyes of his early works on Edward Steichen. Consider how this by Steichen himself relates to Christopher Phillips. Christopher Phillips writes on Strichen's life early in his career. Now he has gone on to more recent, popular works such as Socrates Cafe."
5,Presto! Magic,I think this book is great. Lloyd Alexander really engulfs you with written magic as you read the book. I really like the plot and the way Mr. Alexander describes things and characters. You'll already love the book after you read the first few pages.
2,"Thought provoking, but intellectually dishonest","Peter Gomes has many insights to the correct approach one must take when attempting to understand scripture. He boldly challenges conventional ideas using widely accepted historical precedents. However, in more than one case he glibbly disimisses opposing arguments from other scholars by appealing to a nonexistant consensus on the difficult and controversial topics of the consumption of alcohol, the Biblical acceptibility of homosexual practice (as opposed to homosexual celibacy), and women in the ministry. To deny the existence of well supported opposition from scholarly evangelicals is not responsible. It is one thing to offer one's opinion through strong argument and Biblical support, as Gomes does, but to pretend that the opposing viewpoint is held only by irrationals or anti-intellectuals is intellectually dishonest."
1,"Usual Liberal Slant, disappointed.","Too many ""presummed"" and ""one can gather""after citing examples. His spiritual gift must be mercy. Fails tounderstand the basic truth of the bible that God inspired the Word/Bible to help man live well. To interpert and renegotiate truths so as to make life comfortable to mannow is a slap in the face of God."
3,Witty survey of Biblical takes on current hot topics,"An engaging and humerous walk for those people who want to know more (and feel they ought to)of what the Bible says about contemporary issues: race, anti-Semitism; women, and homosexuality.Since the author is a Baptist minister and chaplain to Harvard University, who has prayed atnational Republican events, the status quo of liberal intellectual ivy-league enclaves isnot going to be rocked even if the rationale for the book was the ""coming-out"" of the authorat a rally in Harvard yard. Those who remain convinced of the authority of the Bible and whowant ""a place at the table"" will find strategies of interpretation to confrontsuffering, joy, evil, temptation, wealth, science and even mystery.Easy to read and minimal footnotes."
5,the real bible,"No parasitical rewriting of Jesus' message. A deeply moving interpretation of Jesus' message for this day and time. Fundamentalists will hate it, though."
5,Homosexuality and other issues clarified with integrity.,"A book that should be read by anyone wanting to understand how to read the Bible with an understanding of it in both the context of the time it was put together by various scholars, and in the context of today's society. The author is a notable scholar himself and yet writes in a style that is asscesible. The whole book is splendidly presented but the best chapter, and one that whould be mandatory reading, is his chapter on homosexuality. He carefully, respectfully and profoundly lays to rest the many misconceptions and misinterpretaions about this issue. If you don't read anything else in this book, read this chapter and share it with everyone you know."
5,A wonderful antidote to the Christian Right,"Dr. Gomes has done a great service for those of us who call ourselves Christians in publishing this book. He exemplifies several traits that are in short supply among self-acclaimed Christian leaders, such as humility, intelligence, wit, discernment, open-mindedness and grace.It's a book about hermeneutics for the layperson, witty without being trite, intelligent without being pretentious. He tackles some of the most difficult elements of biblical interpretation without discrediting either the Bible or those who were guilty of egregious misreadings, such as the pro-slavery champions in the South after the Civil War. His gentleness is a joy to experience, and his book is a gift to the Church."
5,"Balanced, thoughtful and eloquent","For many people, the Bible can be complex, paradoxical and unapproachable. How the stories, messages are interpreted is critical to how one uses them in daily life. Peter Gomes has made the Bible approachable to everyone. He clearly identifies the uses and misuses of the Bible and then transforms them into a ""living word"" of God rather than just a historical text.Thank you Mr. Gomes."
5,AN EXCELLENT VIDEO...FILLED WITH BLACK PRIDE,I watched this video during on The History Channel. I am now purchasing a copy for my home library. The video gives excellent historical information about the role of the African-American aviator during World War II. This video is an excellent teaching tool.
3,Not Lane's better work.,"Not my favorite work from Lane. But still worth the time to read it. I also would recommand, 'The Fist of God' by A.T Nicholas. A great good against evil story with some fresh and cool twists."
3,"Its fun,for a bit...","This is a fun and easy way to make ""your own game"",thou it doesn't really feel like the game is yours;it just seems like its some Japaneses guy's game and your just an editor,it should be called R.P.G. editor 3;it could of been better,they could of given you more ways to customize things in the game;and if your new to this sort of thing then i would suggest getting the official guide to help you thorough the difficult detailing parts of the game.I was very ac cited for this,thou if i would have spent more than the asking price i would ask for my parents money back.But this is good for beginners I would not suggest this to experts thou.This might be fun;but I'd rather be a Dungeon Master in Dungeons and Dragons..."
1,Good for people who are free 24 hours a day.,"This game was very disappointing to me, because I thought making the game would be a simple process. It get's very frustrating, and takes way too much time to play. If I were to guess, only 1 out of 100 people who buy this game actually make a legitimate game when playing it. Also there weren't many character selections, scene selections, dungeon selections, etc. If you have no life and can play a game for 6 hours straight without getting bored, this might be the game for you."
4,Best RPG maker to date,"First I would like comment on earlier remarks about the graphics , they are not terrible, the best description I can come up with is SEGA Dream cast quality for consolers and Morrowind for PC gamers this software is amazing for what it is if you are interested in making games this is a good choice why you might ask ? well first off some people complain about not undestanding the terms used but in truth they serve as an easy intro to game design iterface wich will pay of if you become serious and move on to Dark basic and Caligari Gamespace or similar software In the time it took to write this my son figured out how to make a dungeon and a town, I came to amazon hoping that prima had made a guide for RPG MKR 3 for my son because they made one for #2 and noticed these crtiques I want Aspiring game designers to know this is a great step forward to making something closer to your ideas into something solid"
1,not recive any,"hi sir,please note that i'am not recive any thing from this orderfeed me back about thatkhalid"
4,Great blanket!,"Overall good blanket... a little more ""blue-purple"" than actually purple like how the picture appears, yet I am still please with the color. Its obvious its representative of Omega Psi Phi purple and gold! This will be a great gift."
4,omega blanket,The blanket is exactly as the picture. The colors are vibrant and the blanket is big enough to use as a throw or rug.I purchased it for a birthday present and did not think I would like it. I was impressed.
3,TV video review,I am a great fan of the Grounded for Life series but I did not find the episodes in this season that funny.
3,This book is Alan Dean Foster's child,"Okay let's get this straight. George Lucas of course wrote the story. But he did not write this novel. It's really a novelization. Alan Dean Foster wrote this. It's like the Battlestar Galactica books are written by Robert Thurston, and the stories are by Glen A. Larson, although both are credited and this should not be. This book is solely credited to Lucas, and there is no mention of the ghost writer Foster, and there should be. Foster's writing, at first, seems a little bit awkward, then as I keep reading, I get aligned with it and I simply love how this book ""reads"". It makes you absorb it and, believe it or not, you don't wish for the movie while you're inside of the book."
3,"Not worth reading, since the movie is better","Although it says it's written by George Lucas, it was actually ghost-written by Alan Dean Foster- George was too busy making the movie. There are minor differences between the book and the movie, and there are a couple of extra scenes. However, if you really want a Star Wars fix beyond the trilogy, try listening to the Star Wars radio dramas. They're very well-done. The book, on the other hand, is pretty mediocre compared to the excellent movie. It's also inconsistent, which may offend some hardcore Star Wars addicts (""crucify Alan Dean Foster, for he has commited sacrilage!""). It's not even worth reading for free, so don't spend big bucks tracking down an old copy."
3,Good but not GREAT,"Star Wars was certainly one of the most interesting and culturally exciting events of the last 1/3 of the 20th century as far as Pop Sci Fi was concerned and deserves to be mentioned.But the FACT is that it is the MOVIE that got people excited not the novelization which hardly ranks with ODYSSEY, MOBY DICK et all!It rates with Superman or Batman."
3,Star Wars...,"The book suffers from the same plot problems as the movie in its original form does. As I'm not a huge fan of the series of films, I wasn't all that taken in by the book either. It was interested to read this book as a stand alone document from the 1970s. Some of what to come was there but there was also gaps and inconsistencies (within the book itself and of course with future plot developments)."
3,Not Bad,I recently used this book in an introductory class in graduate school and found it to be a decent textbook. It has some errors and certain things could have been explained in a clearer fashion but all in all I thought it did a decent job. The problems offered in the book are very easy and the answers are at the back which I personally found useful for studying.
3,Relief No More,"There were some good tips for this one-cassette edition, but it was not exactly relaxing listening. The other part said, ""do not listen while driving a car"". Well, I listen to these tape while driving my car."
2,Kingston Datatraveler,"I purchased a 256 mg Kingstron Datatraveler USB drive over other drives mainly because of the Kingston name and the 5 year warranty. It has a nice, sleek design. Installation on my Dell PC running XP was plug 'n play. However, when I started transferring files, the device was obviously slow. I re-read the spec sheet which stated it was USB 1.1 compliant and USB 2.0 ""compatible"". No transfer speeds were mentioned on the package. I did more research and decided to return the device to the store where I bought it. I then purchased a Lexar 2.0 Pro and transferred the same files at what seemed 4x the speed of the Kingston. If you don't care about speed and are more concerned about warranty, then Kingston is for you. The Lexar device ""only"" comes with a 2 year warranty."
3,Siddartha,"I did not find this translation of be of the highest quality. The story in well represented but I found issues with how some of the German phrases were translated into English,"
5,Big stuff in a small package!!,"I began playing this game and at first thought, oh another final fantasy clone, but soon was completely engrossed in the story telling, the characters, the theater quality Anime cut-scenes, and couldn't put it down. And like a favorite book, you may just come back again and again, just to immerse yourself in the Popolocrois universe like I have. Great fun for the whole family. Enjoy!!"
1,VERY CHEAP!! dont waste money,This product is VERY cheaply made. I returned it immediately. It wasn't even sturdy enough to hold my hair dryer. My dryer kept falling out of the holder and the stand kept tipping over...NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY
5,Huge with Room to Expand,I have about a hundred movies and several seasons of TV Shows and this case has so much storage space I feel the urge to go movie shopping!
4,"Very big, but tons of space","I wasn't expecting this to be quite as big, but it fits a LOT of cds. I wouldn't recommend it for the car, unless you always have someone with you, but it's nice to be able to keep so many cds in one case."
3,Not quite what I imagined,"This case is flimsy and all the pages are very loose inside the case and slide around. I expected better quality for $30. Also, there isn't anything that keeps the discs in the sleeves. I bought this to be a long term case for my DVDs but I'm not sure it's going to last as long as I had hoped."
3,"Misrepresented, but the case works OK.","Like other reviewers for this product, my case arrived without a removable sleeve. The case still works and it's OK in quailty. Not improved, though. I also own several of the same item that I purchased years ago (before the brown stitching) and they are a heavier gauge Koskin material and padding.I'm not surprised that the improvement was taking the good quality out of their product. Since the economy tanked, makers from foods to dryer sheets to coffee to T-shirts are all making their products as cheaply as possible to save money or raising their prices. Case Logic and this CD/DVD case is no different. Works OK, but don't expect the same good quality as before.(I emailed Amazon about the missing sleeve and asked them to either change the product description or ship the correct item they described to future buyers.)"
4,DVD Holder,The Case Logic product is very Compact yet holds over 300 CD/ Dvd's. If I could find anything wrong with it it would be closing it. once open to it s fullest getting the zipper to close takes some time and patience. Otherwise it is a very good holder.
4,I love it!,I took my music library from this huge tower down to just this case and all my collection fit perfectly. I am now working on doing the same with my movies. I love knowing I can grab my entire music or movie library and bring it along for a weekender at my girlfriends house. Great product.
1,"Beware, this new design is HORRIBLE","i have 4 of the older versions of this case. They are great. The new cases are awful. The new design uses cheaper materials, ugly brown stitching instead of the original black on black. the new handle is cheap and feels like it is going to rip out, you can no longer slide a label in the ""easy-view"" spine because there is no longer a place to insert labelsI use to have no problem paying more money for these Case Logic cases over the other brands because the quality WAS exceptional. Now they are just as cheaply made as the other companies, but still have the high price taghopefully Case Logic reads these reviews and bring back the old design next year....until then i guess i'll just have to spend my time searching ebay for the old version of these cases"
2,"Good idea, but poor follow through","I just want to start off and say the product appears nice and it holds DVDs well. I purchased two and filled both binders up with DVD's, and when I went to zip them up the nylon by the zipper tore at the seem. This happened on both binders. The material is a very cheap, thin nylon material. Would not recommend to anyone who plans to fill these binders full because as soon as you zip them up they will rip."
3,I like it...,I have a large collection of dvd's and this is a great way for me to save space. My sister is ordering one for herself.
4,Good but cheap,"I paid around $12 and i see the price fluctuate like crazy which is I want to make this clear.I would have liked it more under $10.The quality is poor, very cardboard like, though it is leather. the zipper is cloth though, so that's a lie.CAUTION: The sleeve does not come out. It is inside booklet style. I knew this beforehand but be careful.GOOD: Prime shipping was great and good packaging. Holds CDs very well.BAD: Inferior quality. Could be sold cheaper, honestly."
4,Cheap and well made.,Exactly what I was looking for. It's made pretty well and is perfect for storing my video games. Shipping was fast and very glad I got this.
5,Love It!,"I love this case. I had my wall unit full of dvd cases, now I have plenty of room. I'm so happy I got rid of all those dusty dvd cases. All my dvd's are now stored and easy to find. Should have bought this years ago. This is very well made and looks sharp.I love it so much I ordered a second case for my cd collection. This is the smart way to store all your disks. With my cd's I took the inside sleeve out and placed it behind the disk so I can read what tunes are on each disk. So much dusty clutter gone."
3,not so much,have used case logic for years. somewhat disappointed.this media storage wallet does not have the same quality we have come to expect with case logic products.diane says we can make it work...but outer cover is just vinyl...not woven fabric we like from older items.i guess for the price...this is ok...but i was pleased to see other case logic items we purchased were of better quality.amazon experience was great as usual.
2,Zipper Issue,Received the case today and filled it up with DVDs. No real problems until you go to try and zip it up. It took me about 10 minutes to work the zipper from the spine and around a curve.
5,Great Product I own 4,Like I said I own 4 of these Case logic dvd books. They hold up to wear and tear well and are an easy way of storing discs!
4,"Great for the price, but kinda cheap","What can I say for this commodity item. It does the job, but don't expect too much. If you just expect something to hold your CDs and DVDs then you'll get a great product. If you think you're buying a leather case for life to lug around your car don't bother. This is an amazing buy for the price but I don't see this lasting more than a few months under heavy use."
3,Case Logic Standards slipping/Case Logic KSW320,The case was shipped in a timely manner. I am disappointed withthe case. Mediocre materials and lightly built. Definitely not for aRoad Warrior.
5,Perfect For My Collection!,"I am incredibly satisfied with this product. It was available at the best price around from Amazon, and it holds a lot of the movies from my collection. Perfect quality, I like the leather cover on the front and the pages on the inside. I wonder why they don't have the same disc spaces on the back cover as they do on the front like in other sleeves I've had but it's not that big of a problem. Now I just need to purchase a few more in the future, and the storage for my movie collection will be complete!"
5,good case,I got this on one of their daily deals and it holds up quite well.it has 16 of the disc pockets on the case and the rest in removable sleeves.
5,Item is slightly different than picture,"I just received this case in the mail today. This is the second one I have bought off of amazon (this exact item), but this one was not exactly the case described and pictured above. It had a cardboard sleeve/carton wrapped around it that also described and pictured this item as it appears above. The cardboard wrapper didn't match the item in it.I like the new design better though. It looks nicer, the Koskin material is slightly brown, but just barely (it looks black until you inspect it closely). The Handle is more secure, actually attached inside the material.THE ONLY BAD DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE 16 SLOTS IN THE FRONT OF THE CASE AREN'T REMOVABLE, LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. I own the other case (the one described and picture above), and the removable 16 CD folder is pretty handy.Otherwise, I'm happy with the changes and will not return it. In fact, I'm ordering another one!! BUT, AMAZON SHOULD CHANGE THEIR DESCRIPTION."
3,lower quality,"I bought a version of this wallet 2 years ago to transport DVDs back to Japan with me and avoid lugging a ton of DVD cases through airports. I liked the wallet a lot, so I ordered another one recently. While the construction and quality inside the wallet don't appear to have changed, the condition of the leather-like cover seems to have gone down, as has the quality of the zipper (it now has just a nylon tag attached to it instead of a Koskin tab) and the board used to firm up the cover. The result is a flimsier feeling product. Won't be buying this on-line again as the product I received is different from the one in the photo (that one looks more like the first case I bought). Appearances aside, the case does fulfill its purpose."
2,"I like the ""un-improved"" ones better","The old Koskin design is great. I have 5 and just logged on to order one for a friend and am quite disappointed to see the changes, so... my friend will be getting something else. The way the old handle was attached was very cool, a selling point. Plus the mesh in the handle made orderly labeling easy and attractive. The ""OLD' Koskin material was pretty cool too. If all this has changed - find something else - no reason to stick with Case Logic for average stuff. You can get no-name discount junk everywhere. Hope Case Logic reads this."
4,case logic ksw-64 72 dvd wallet black,i got it and unpacked it and stocked it up with my dvd's and i love it. if i had it to do all over again i would buy it and unpack it and load it and love it again!!Thank you and good night!RB
5,Great way to store CD's and DVD's,"I have quite a few DVDs and CDs. I find these a terrific way to store them so I don't have to hunt thru the mountain of boxes stacked a couple of rows deep on the wall. I've been using these for almost 10 years now and thru several generations. (Seriously this is my 10th) They protect them well and provided your careful in placing the disc and when removing it will not scrtch it. They're not just great for storage either, but also travel. Grab one of these and a portable DVD player and a road trip just flies by. The durability is good but a fully loaded case will eventually throw it's carry strap. I've got two of the previous generation that have but none of the four of this model have...yet. Amazon's price can't be beat on this so get it here! All in all I think this is the answer to storge problems of DVD and BluRay, so get one while they're still around!"
5,Great buy,I bought two of these because I wanted to get rid over 700 DVD/CD cases to save space. Great product for price was able to get everything in two books with 8 pages left over. Amazon sells $20 cheaper than nest buy leant other online site.
5,Very nice,"Love the case so far,holds quite a bit and was very well priced vs other products based on how much it holds.Will buy another when I fill this one up for sure."
4,What's in your disc wallet?,"Having used this for the past 2 months, I believe it will serve the intended purpose. The plastic sleeves are a bit tight, but that keeps the discs from sliding out. You are able to get 2 discs into one sleeve if needed.Only real complant has already been described in other reviews: the zipper is sometimes difficult to use when closing the case. I suspect it's due to when the case is fully opened 180 degrees, there is a lot of ""slack"" which needs to be pulled forward when zipping closed. A better design could have prevented this. Still, for the price, it does the job."
4,Just What I Needed,"I was a little skeptical about buying this online as I'd found similar items at Target and wan't thrilled with the features. My desire for the high capacity overcame my reluctance to purchase sight unseen. I used two pockets per CD - one for the liner notes, one for the disk. It worked out perfectly and has saved a ton of space. I ordered two and need one more, I'll definately buy the third from Amazon soon. One caveat - the zipper is a little hard to begin unzipping. It's kinda buried in the binding edge when closed and doesn't have firm support to pull against to open. Minor detail as these are more for storage than use since we have our music ripped to itunes. Cheers"
4,Swaim,"Good alternative to storing all my cd's and dvd's in a rubbermaid container. Stores a lot, looks nice, hopefully it stands the test of time, good buy."
4,Case Logic Rules!!,"I ordered this item because I needed to free up space with my DVD collection. When full it is bulky and can be heavy, but it totally rocks for having an entire collection of DVD's at your fingertips. So far, I have not found it cheaper anywhere else but Amazon."
4,Good product,"I have had this CD case for at least five years and it is still as good as new. I don't access it too much but it is always in my car, getting stepped on and bounced around. Plenty of capacity for me."
4,Still good investment,"I have several of the older Case Logic binders, which I prefer over this newer version. The only reason I'm not 100% satisfied is their new method of securing the pages. It used to be a simple binder method, which made it very convenient. Now, you have to remove everything in front if you want to change the position of a page, which is a pain."
3,Photos are not accurate,The overall product is fine. My main feedback is that the photos still show a version with a detachable front insert. The current version being shipped does not include this feature.
2,Not the solid built sides for stand up use,Not the solid built sides for stand up use nor do they have label insert in the handle for identification.to stiffen; I cut out cardboard strips (out of some shipping boxes) a couple of inches wide and bent into a capital J tri fold shape. then placed it between the page edge and zipper. It still allows access to the discs and I can stand them up on end with handles up for easy grab.would have better score if solid sides.
5,Awesome game case,"This case works wonderful, the sleeves are nice and crisp, and everything stays organized. It looks really sharp, and the zipper is strong. I've enjoyed this case for almost a year now."
4,good quality will never change,"this new case i bought is definitely a winner. i have 2 case logic cases that i bought 17 years ago with 17 moves under the belt, and they are 90% in good shape. i gave this only 4 stars because i don't like the canvas type nylon edges where you zip it up. the pages are thinner than my old pages in my other case logic cases. the silver lining to that is you can replace the pages. they come out with a pull and a click. I'm sure these cases will out last most marriages. enjoy if you buy it."
2,Hard To Close,"You know the saying, ""They don't make 'em like they use to."" Well... they don't make 'em like they use to.It kind of does the job, but it's incredibly hard to close. Whether it's half full or full, the zipper gets stuck and you have to work hard to get it to zip the first inch or two. After that, it closes without a problem. I've tried not opening it all the way but then the case won't lay out correctly and you can't flip the pages. (PS - Even all the way open, it's hard to flip the pages.)If you need a cheap case to archive a bunch of discs, this should do it. If you want to access your stuff often, pick a brand that still believes in quality."
1,Did not receive my case,I did not receive the case and they did not try to resend to the right address. Be careful to all.
3,Less than expected,"Unlike what was written in the previous review the 16 CD section is not removable. The binder rings are thin plastic, too big and look bad. The pages are thinner than I expected. All together I am not sure this wallet will last long."
4,This thing is HUGE!,"Great organizer. I'm very pleased with the design. However, this is one of those ""stay at home"" organizers, because it will take up all the space in a small duffel bag or backpack. Let's just say you're not going to be doing much traveling with it, because it won't be convenient."
4,A case is a case,"What can I say? CaseLogic is pretty decent quality, so you'll probably get what you expect. Its pretty well constructed, but if you put your case through a lot of abuse, you may wish to get something a little more sturdy.What else can I say though? Just go to a store and pick one, then find it online for (usually) cheaper. Thats the way I usually do my shopping."
2,"Cheaply made, poor quality.","The quality of these DVD/CD wallets has long been suspect, and this is a perfect example. Feels lightweight and cheap. I can't imagine this piece lasting more than a year without zipper problems, or similar issues."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"Decent build quality for the money. Stores discs, doesn't burst into flames, and seems as if it will last. Also is not clear so it is easy to find when empty."
2,Crappy Case - Poor Quality - Buy Targus Citygear Instead,I've owned many Case Logic CD cases over the years. The quality of the construction has declined markedly during that time. This one feels cheap and not durable at all.I'm going to buy a Targus Citygear case instead; its construction quality is superior to this one.
3,DVD case eliminator!,"This DVD file has reduced the bulk of the DVD boxes off our shelves. The case looks attractive, and seems sturdy enough to last. However, the zipper is a little difficult to zip all the way around after you open the case, and are trying to zip it closed. I would like a pocket on the front of the case to label the file to differentiate TV shows, and movies...etc.We needed 3 cases to house our 700+ plus discs, and though I miss seeing the DVD box information...it has reduced the eye sore of all that clutter!"
2,New Design is not good,"I have a 4 other of these Case Logic Koskin CD Wallets. The new design does not match my other other cases. It looks odd on my bookshelf. The handle design is cheesy. What's with the brown stitching? Looks cheap. Plus, now instead of having 100% kyoskin they have this shiny nylon around the zipper. If you need more sleeves, just buy one of these from ANTOnline, use the sleeves and take the cover to Good Will.Case Logic designers go back to the original design."
1,NEW VERSION REALLY IS GARBAGE!!!,"I own both the old version and this new version. The new one sucks plain and simple. Fist of all it isn't made of leather, like it says, it is made of plastic that looks like leather. The construction is nowhere near the quality of the old version. The sides are made out of nylon and not cloth like the old version. The fabric that holds the disks is significanlty crappier and is so thin it is see through. Even the zipper is crappier. Nothing about is has been improved what so ever. EVERYTHING has been made 100% cheaper and crappier. Avoid at all cost. Go with someone else. Case Logic has just lost a customer for LIFE."
4,Very nice and efficient case,"This case has a nice feel to it. Because it has a hard back and no strap in the way, it is excellent for applying a label to and using to sort your CD or DVD collection. I bought 12 of these cases for this purpose.My only complaint is that it is advertised as, ""72 Capacity"", but the internal description says, ""Holds 64 CDs."" There is room for 8 more in the front cover, but no pages for permanent storage. In spite of the bait-and-switch feel of this advertising hiccup, it's hard to get more disks stored for a lesser price."
3,Its a good case for the price,Overall its a pretty good case. My only real complaint is how difficult it is to zip it closed once you have it fully open. I would really like a hard case but the price is excessive on all the ones I found.
1,Won't take your liner notes.,"I just purchased this item - now I'm planning to return it tomorrow. One of the advertised features, the ability to store liner notes just doesn't work properly. They just don't into the pocket without bending and/or forcing them in. To me, the liner notes have value and I'm not willing to fold, spindle, or otherwise mutilate them to fit them into the wallet."
3,This product is ok,"This product is ok. I was expecting something a lot better. It does have a leather front to it, but when you open it it's nothing to cry about. I probably wouldn't purchase another one, but then again it's only for cd's. I think the product is ok and the price and shipping could have been a lot cheaper."
4,Great Spacesaver!,"I bought this along with the 344 cd wallet and as I've mentioned in my review of the other product I find it to be both durable and useful. I would have given five stars if this cd wallet came with a handle like the other one. All in all, case logic seems to make quality products and I will absolutely be buying from them for all of my cd/dvd storage needs. An excellent product at a price that does not hurt my checkbook. Way to go Case Logic!!! I absolutely recommend both this and the 344 cd wallet to anyone looking for a storage solution that can save them space in their apartment, house or dorm!"
2,These keep getting cheaper and cheaper,The quality has gone downhill in this brand. The outer material is very thin and everything is light gauge. When you open the book all the way the zipper gets pulled way in and it a pain to get out. At the end of the day it does hold the CDs/DVDs but there are much better options in the same price range out there.
5,Organization,Good deal for the money. Binder well made with good material. Holds plenty of CD's DVD's and computer software. Things are much more organized now.
4,great for the price,"I received this cd wallet a couple of weeks ago and I have been pretty satisfied with it. The only problem I have with it is that it is kind of hard to zip closed. The zipper just doesn't want to start closing at first and you really have to work with it but for the price I can deal with that. I make back up copies of many of my CD's and DVD's and this holds them all well. If I ever get this filled all the way up I will purchase another one. As for the brown stitching, I have no idea why people complain about it. I think it looks rather nice."
2,Save Your Money,"Case Logic has, I'm afraid, lost its way depending on its prior reputation and not producing good products anymore. I wasted my money buying two of these cases. I don't trust any of Amazon's posted measurements after buying dozens and dozens of products so I don't even look anymore. I purchased this 72 CD case because I wanted smaller more convenient cases rather than buying bulky larger 200+ CD cases. Well they evidently must use the same bulky case for all of their CD cases regardless of the number of sleeve inserts. This has a 2.5 inch wide backbone for the less than 1/2 thick CD sleeves. The other 2 inches is just air. What a waste! The CD sleeves are standard and apparently just glued onto the inside backbone not bound in any way. The cheap thin vinyl covering and light zipper material just added to a completely disappointing product. No more Case Logic for me."
1,Garbage product! Buyer BEWARE!!!!,"I am actually quite angry for all of the reviews above one star on here. This product is so bad I'm tempted to throw it directly in the garbage can. I have old cases, (not case logic) that are built solid with metal ring binders, easy to open and close, and look great. This case should be priced at $3.99 for those that was a piece of crap for cheap. This was SHOCKINGLY poor quality. I will never buy a case logic product EVER again!"
2,CHEAP,"I have always bought case mate, but this case was AWFUL. The fabric was very cheap and would definitely tear easily. Not recommended at all"
1,"WASTE OF MONEY, in more ways than you should ever find out.","If you really need a dvd wallet, get one that has some kind of hard plastic thing to hold your discs in. I took a couple of these wallets around for a month-long vacation, and the vast majority of the discs I had in there are scratched up, and I'm pretty damn confident that most of these discs will never work again. Do yourself a huge favor, don't make my mistake, and find some other way to carry your discs around. Thanks for this PoS, I've now lost hundreds of dollars' worth of dvds."
4,Great way to store cd/dvd's.,"Like most people who have a lot of music &/or movies, the plastic cases just take up space. This case allows for great storage of discs, regardless of type. The pages allow for 4 discs and 2 jackets, and you can purchase additional pages as necessary. The only downsize is that the books are wider than one would expect, and there is no way to label the books to see what they contain from the outside binding."
2,BEWARE ! THIS IS UPDATED Ver. of CASE LOGIC NOT AS THE PICTURE !,"Well, I feel rip off. This is NOT the same as the Picture (Case Logic Koskin 1st Generation) instead the one I got is the Updated version which is CRAP !! Different Quality, has Ugly orange/brown stitches. Looks like the material won't last that long. Soo Regret.. Case Logic is downgrading material.. I miss the old Case Logic.I rate 2 Stars because inside the case kinda similar but not the same."
4,Great case,My husband is a DJ and has many cases. He likes that the sleeves can be removed and rearranged the orders when needed.
4,Very good product.,"Very well made. Very functional. It has a large capacity. I recommend it if you want keep together your cd's, dvd's & blu ray's."
3,Good size case but,"I like that this case is large as I have many discs to store, however the design needs some work. They made it so it opens flat which is good but when you go to close it the zipper is very difficult to get started. Just a small problem but a problem."
4,excellent,very good product.. actually came with a bonus 8 cd sleeve to attach to a car visor for free. very happy with the product
5,Love this case!,I got this CD wallet awhile ago and continue to use it at capacity for my Karaoke CD's. The case holds its shape and stands up like a book in a shelf even when full of CDs. The CDs themselves are easy to put in and take out and are not scratched by the backing in the holder. The pages are good quality and I haven't noticed any tearing of the sleeves. Highly recommended!
4,Great Simple case!,"This cd case is perfect for all of my burned cds and holds them safely so they do not get scratched. The outside zipper construction seems a little flimsy though. Almost like the fabric holding the zipper is made out of the same material that those 're-usable' or 'green' shopping bags are, however I am pretty gentle on things like this, so I think it will be fine. I wouldn't expect this to last very long around rough kids or someone that just tosses things around, but overall I think it will do its job for quite a while in my case."
3,It's a cd/dvd wallet.,"It's certainly not the best cd/dvd wallet out there, but its not bad. Its a cheap buy, ships quickly, and holds your cds/dvds. So unless your super picky about all the little things, its a pretty decent buy."
5,The Perfect Size,"The 128 KSW DVD/CD wallet from Case Logic offers easy protected storage. They open to show eight discs at a time. Round 3/4"" labels can be slipped into the corner of each compartment to number each disc in your collection. At full capacity, this case is easy to transport. Larger styles are too heavy when full. The 128 KSW binders stack like books on a library shelf flanking a TV in my entertainment center. They fit seven on a 20"" wide shelf. I now have 35 of these albums. I need seven more."
2,Not great,"I LOVE action movies. But this story has recently been done with Death Race. It was the same concept. Man in prison for murder, x amount of ""games"" to win his freedom, the one behind the game doesn't want him free...blah blah blah. Too soon for such a similar story Hollywood."
2,"razzle dazzle flick, but nothing more","Simply put, this movie is all action and no plot. There is a very basic storyline, and the movie is very predictable. There are plenty of intense action sequences, which were actually well done, however there is a lot of unnecessary nudity. Watch this movie purely for the action, EVERYTHING else is garbage. I think it is a step up from Crank, but that is not saying much."
1,Game Over,"After watching Gerard Butler's he-man performance as king Leonidas in ""300,"" I walked out of the theater allowing myself for the first and last time to day dream about what it would be like to be a private in the Greek army (that doesn't sound right but I'm going to leave it). So it was with some anticipation that I waited to see ""Gamer,"" I was completely let down. Gamer is as bad an action flick as I've seen in some time, I half expected Steven Segal to make a cameo. Made for someone with the mentality of a twelve year old, and not a particuarly bright twelve year old at that. If Gerard Butler makes a few more duds like this he's going to wind up back where he started, in Scotland practicing divorce law."
1,No digital copy,"Do not buy if you are at all interested in the digital copy. The digital copy code is no longer valid after January, 2011."
1,Disc would not play!,"I can't comment on the film itself as the Blue-ray would not even play properly on my new (within the last 6 months) Samsung Blue-ray player.For some stupid reason it would only display a small square of the total screen, that is until I hit the eject button and then the whole screen would show for a split second. I tried exchanging the disc and had the same result.Other Blue-rays work as do dvds but not Gamer..."
1,Utter crap,"I had to turn this off after about thirty minutes. No human connection to any characters at all, just non-stop violence and gross outs. Just because it is called an action movie doesn't mean that it should have all action and no plot. I think there has to be some human connection with at least one character, I turned the film off because there was none. There are a few good actors in the film but they were never given the chance to perform. I rarely shut off a movie before finishing but it was just so incredibly bad and one dimensional that I did. If it turned into Shakespeare in the final two hours then I might have missed out on a classic but if the rest of the movie was only ten times better than the first thirty minutes it would still be crap. Utter drivel. Next!"
2,tedious,Worst movie I've seen in recent times.A tried and tired storyline.The only thing good about this blu ray is the picture quality.The action scenes look good enough to sell TVs.It goes into my 'Watch once only' pile.
3,"Cool Movie, Boring Lead",I thought this movie was okay. The action scenes were kind of confusing and Gerard Butler was not that engaging as the lead. I have seen him in other movies and he can be really interesting but he just wasn't given much to do but run around and shoot guns.All this is made up for by some great scenes involving the games Society and Slayers. Games in which players from home control real human beings. The Society game where people were forced to have sex and eat bugs was a lot more interesting than the Slayers scenes where Gerard Butler just ran around.Logan Lerman was great as the kid controlling Gerard Butler and Michael C. Hall is so awesome as the villain who is like an evil Bill Gates.Michael C. Hall's song and dance routine near the end is worth the price of the whole movie alone. I wish he'd get more weird crazy roles like.
3,No worth it to own it.. Just worth to watch it..,"I like to played video games and if you like it too; you will find kind of fun this movie. The main plot of the movie is that the guy (Gerard Butler) is controlled by a kid who plays the video game. Gerard has to win 30 matches to get himself free. I did not find the movie boring at all. I really enjoyed it. But honestly this movie I only would watch it once, THATS IT! So in other word if you can rent it as I did, do it. I recommend the movie to anyone who likes to see a lot of gunfire."
3,Special Features have Butler's Prized Possession,"Online and in print, many have noticed how often G. Butler shows his butt in films. Here, you only get to see it in the special features section. But it's not just a glimpse; it's a whole lotta booboo. He drops his pants to show that the directors' faces are drawn on his butt cheeks. It's meant as a joke, but it shows that Butler knows where his paycheck comes from. If you like his beefy orbs, then this instance will really turn you on."
5,Gamer the movie,"This movie is a great movie espesially for those who like video games, it relates very well to them.It is non-stop action from beginning to end.A very well made movie."
3,Not a lot of fighting action,"Yeah this movie looked like it was a great interactive action movie but I was let down. only about 24 (if that) of the movie were actually cool and in the war field the rest was ""action"" all right but not the kind I was looking for and even that wasn't great. Couldn't enjoy because you knew what was going on was not truly consenting."
2,Is what is expected,"Movie was a little more graphic thN expected,Interesting concept. Worth a watch, the characters ate interesting.Actors. Do great job!!"
1,This is a great comedy.,"I saw it in the cinema and people laughed hard all the time, especially when it becomes a Broadway musical at the end.It looks nice graphically though.The script is sssso uninspired."
2,THE BUTLER DID IT,"Since I'm not a ""gamer"" I base my comments purely on the entertainment value of this film. The makers of GAMER were also responsible for the two CRANK movies which I liked. This movie has the hyperactive and chaotic action sequences but not CRANK's humor. GAMER also has some elements of SURROGATES which I liked a little better. I'm not a big fan of Gerard Butler..he seems passive in this role. I'm a big fan of Michael C. Hall and Kyra Sedgwick and they're okay in their roles. Nix also to Marilyn Manson's remake of SWEET DREAMS. Scary look at a future where life is lived via computers!"
2,One star for camp value,"OK, I'll be honest, I knew this movie was going to be bad before I saw it, but my nephew really wanted to see it for his birthday, and I thought it might be worth some laughs. Well there are some funny scenes. Not sure that it was inteded that way, but if you like camp, this movie has it. To be fair there is some decent acting, and dexter is a hoot, but the concept is rediculous, and there was really only one of two ways this movie could go. Bad but amusing, or just plain bad. Most of it was just plain bad. But if you like to watch bad films with a couple 12 packs and a few friends, this one is worth a few laughs."
3,Gamer [Blu-ray],"Set in a future-world where humans can control other humans in mass-scale, multi-player online gaming environments, a star player from a game called ""Slayers"" looks to regain his independence while taking down the game's mastermind. This movie, it's entertaining and presents an interesting world with some scary realizations."
3,;0/,"This movie is not what I expected, the graphics alone are bad we have better technology you would think this was made in 2001. To me it felt like a low budget movie that you would find on Netflix. Normally I would break down what the movie is but I'm so disappointed in this movie."
4,good,"Movie was entertaining, lots of action and the such.. if your are not mesmerized by all the bullets it might not be for you"
2,One Woman's Opinion,"I'm willing to put up with a lot to watch Gerard Butler. I totally went with him on his journey through 'Law Abiding Citizen.' This movie, however, is trashy and exploitive dressed up as social satire. (I did like the Society outfits, though.) What really left a sour taste in my mouth, though, was the brief but ultra-sleazy role played by Milo Ventimiglia. It ruins the image of TV's rebellious but ultimately kind-hearted Jess from 'Gilmore Girls' and lovelorn, super-powered nurse Peter Petrelli from 'Heroes.' Skip this one. A much better Gerard Butler movie is 'Reign of Fire.' (Any movie where Christian Bale has a beard is a good movie, FYI.) A much better Milo V. cameo is in 'Cursed.'"
1,Gamer,"I got this on sale for fairly cheap, even though I knew no one really said anything positive about this movie. No wonder why. I couldnt make it past twenty minutes. Good actors are wasted on this awful mess, avoid this film at all cost."
1,Not ready for the close up.,"Note to the director, pull the camera back and use close ups when necessary. John Leguizamo should see a dentist quick. Overall the movie looks like something that was made by a 12 year old EXTREME Mountain Dew drinking brat with money. This movie was a complete waste of time. Bad story (Running Man did it better) worse directing, writing and cinematography. Not quite as bad as Crank 2."
1,Unplayable!,Will not play on blue ray player without update - so you are out of luck if not connected to the internet. Too bad it didn't tell you than in the ad.
3,MEH! it really was not what i expected,okayy so i went to see this in the theater looking for an intense action movie... ill just say it there were more scenes with nudity than action and it ruined most of the movie. this had so much potential and they added too much nudity. They should have worked on the plot a lot more. NOT WORTH BUYING!
1,Really misleading Trailor,"I was really excited about his movie... Super awesome concept and the preview was awesome! Once I went to watch it... I realized it was a boring, twisted, foul languaged, and nearly a ""prono"".Don't watch it, don't buy it... it is awful."
1,Game Over,"Awful. I love good action movies. This isn't one. I rented this and had to fast-forward to one car chase, and then to the climax, such as it is. You'll have more fun playing Pac Man."
1,Shame on you!,"This movie is completely trash; a waste of money and a waste of time. I am surprised at the caliber of actors agreeing to perform in this piece of garbage. Were they hard up for a job? From the opening scene to the end there was no continuity, of story line, let alone even an attempt to connect with reality, which might have given a degree of credibility. At this point it impresses me as some a male high school kid's wet dream, considering the arbitrary use of the four letter word, violence and girl on girl action. Wow it's the Sims gone wild. This cannot even be considered an art film, or even good Sci-Fi. Shame on the director, producer and actors for the perpetration of trash on society."
1,Worst Ever,"I wish I would have read the review before seeing this moving and wasting $10.00 on a ticket. Should have left, but felt I had to justify wasting my money. Just to much sadistic sexual content that added nothing to the story. I am not sure what Gerard Butler was thinking when he made this movie."
1,What A Mess,"After seeing this film, I looked it up and found that it was from the same duo that madeCrank (Widescreen Edition)andCrank 2: High Voltage. If you've seen either one of those movies, you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect: lots of violence with a plot put together by a 3-year-old. When it was clear that this movie was going nowhere, I found myself wondering what the actors saw in the script that made them want to do it.A perfect metaphor for this film I take directly from it: in order to fuel up an empty vehicle, Gerard Butler uses his own vomit and urine to fuel it (those aren't typos). All I can say is that I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.But as in every pile of crap there is one thing that stands out, and in this film that one thing is a fight set to ""I've Got You Under My Skin"". But that is nowhere near to making up for the rest of this cinematic abomination."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Once I saw it, I was really disappointed.The movie has very little structure, and way too much shaky-cam. Like Bourne part 2, we don't need to see shaky cam to get the implied sense of action -- these effects were much more subtle in Bourne 1. The reason I mention this is because Gamer was WAY OVER THE TOP with the shaky cam. We're talking ""Blaire Witch"" shaky.There is no artistic value added by the shaky cam, and it seems to be a device used to try to dress up an otherwise marginal movie.As yet another rehash of ""The Running Man"", this doesn't even come close. The recent remake of ""Death Race"", which was re imagined as a rehash of ""The Running Man"" concept did a far superior job telling a story, conveying action, had better special effects, and actually had what I would call a ""plot"". Gamer's plot is like ""The Running Man"" meets ""Surrogates"" (or perhaps both are comparable to ""Logan's Run"").This movie was a disappointing mess."
3,eh it was alright,the video quality was great it was not in ts original packaging as described and was instead in a dvd case
2,"So Much Potential, So Much Disappointment","This movie had the potential to have a great message, as well as being entertaining. However, it just could not pull it off. It is true that our society is amusing itself to death. We now need to be entertained, rather than think for ourselves, because if we do not we will be manipulated by those holding power within society. This movie could have communicated that message, but instead it is mired down in an effort to hold our attention that results from a poor script. Mildly entertaining, but not worth buying."
4,"Good, but not great","I use this a lot when I'm setting up night photography in the field. The light is great and I really like the dual power settings. But I hate the rotating switch on the front. It has multiple settings (8) for SOS signals, warning blinks, signaling space aliens, you name it. I can't tell you how many times I turned it the wrong way and am suddenly sending SOS signals to Mars. This would rate a full 5 stars if they just had a simple on-off switch for the light and put all of the other crap on some sub switch."
3,Inova 24/7,"This product has a very good material quality and has a lot of settings/light functions. The reason why I only gave it a 3 star is because the white steady light (which I use most often) on its highest setting is not bright enough but with the other light functions ex. hazard light (red), strobe etc they are bright enough."
2,a bad Master's thesis...,"Though this book contains a lot of interesting and useful information (which is why it gets two stars instead of just one), it is basically a Master's thesis written mostly in incomprehensible academic jargon. Naturally, Chuck Jones gave it an enthusiastic recommendation.It's yet another example of how publishers don't care to edit books."
2,dry as toast!,"I checked this book out of the library hoping to gain insight into the various creators of American cartoons. While this book is well-researched and contains a comprehensive history of cartoons from the twenties through the fifties, it is far from a lighthearted read. The scholarly tone is dry and dull, and what should be an intriguing topic becomes a chore to get through. I'm not sure what audience this book was intended for, but it must be a small one.I'd avoid this book unless college textbooks keep you on the edge of your seat!"
2,brand warfare: how to do stuff you already know,"this book just bad. its lack of informtion is apalling and the little information it does provide is most likely know by the reader already. i have no idea how these books compare to the other ones, but when you need to get a book for thi class, dont get this one. instead of reading this book, you should watch grass grow, at least you'll learn about photosynthesis. Better than nothing, like this book"
4,brand building,"This book was insightful. D'Alessandro beats into the reader the fact that companies must confront rumors, scandals, etc. no matter how small as soon as possible. He also reminds the reader to be responsible, all of this in the interest of keeping a good ""brand"" in the view of consumers. This book is a must for anyone who is interested in advertising or brand building of any sort."
3,Boring but Educational,"Brand warfare is a book for people who allready in the business world and just need tips on how to gain success. It shows you the way to gain attention to your company, while at the same time keeping a low profile. Some of the ideas are common sence, but David F. D'alessandro goes into detail and excavates all the small pieces that result into success. One of the negatives of the book is that it seems to go into different ideas, while never really finishng them. I would recommend these to a more adult minded and business type of person. The style of righting and content is directed toward individuals with some backround in the field of advertisment of a product. If you are lokking for book that is captivating, I would not reccomend these book for you."
2,Falling apart!!!,"I bought this book brand new from Amazon and the pages are falling out of the book, it looks like the binding was poorly done. I would return it but I need to use for the semester and can't afford to return it now. It's bad, every few pages 2 or 3 will fall out and then there is even a page that wasn't printed. The book goes from p 67 to 70. VERY DISSAPOINTED"
4,Great Book,"This book is not boring at all, it makes you think about the brands that we buy ourselves. This book explains the importance of a brand. The companies try to get their brand known and the more it is known then the more success they will have. I liked the book because it made me realize that the business world is really competitive out there and they have to come out with something new and unique in order to set them apart from the rest of the other brands. I, as a consumer never stopped to think of how the brands got my attention and while I was reading this book I learned the whole process behind building a brand. This book is really informative and I believe that if you read it you will enjoy it."
3,Grand Cover,"I read this book for my econ class, and choose it because of the cover. I was more interested in that than the first chapter, but found it to be an easy read and an interesting look into the advirtising brand business. I know now that I don't want to go into advirtising."
3,"It was good, but it could have been a little shorter.","D'Alessandro seems like a very experienced person. He has examples for every comment and point he makes. His points are clear and organized. I agree with some of the rules such as that a good brand will make good employees and better workers. I also agree that if there is a scandal of some sort, it should be corrected, even if it is just a rumor. Although the examples helped to convey his point, D'Alessandro's ideas sometimes conflict with the points he tried to make. Sometimes they went a little off topic. His ideas were good, but I think taht some of his ezamples were too clustered and made the book longer than it needed to be."
3,Almost Hits the Spot,"David D'Alessandro's book comes close to hitting the spot with his explanation of Branding. Although there are very useful thoughts throughout the book, most relate to spending large sums of money promoting an ideal that may not hold up in real life. Sure branding is important. Maybe more important than most executives believe. But branding can't be done in a vacuum. Branding works if the position is palatable to your target customer base. Of course D'Alessandro points out ways to obtain hints from customer clusters on what might work, but stops short of anything more helpful in figuring out this difficult feat. After reading this book I longed for more help!"
1,From the guy who invented sliced bread??,"This book is a nice little autobiography but doesn't say much in terms of branding and brand building. Books by Al Ries, David Akers and the like offer much more insightful information. There was way too much self-promotion and not enough substance."
2,"Not good, but not a complete waist of time","The main plot of the story is that this terafromer guy comes to the station to bring a nearby sun back to life. Along with him is his wife a mysterious alien with telepathic powers. Shortly after, Capt. Sisko in one of his insomniatic phases, goes for a walk around his station, and meets a mysterious woman (what a coincidence). Well it ends up turning out that the two mysterious women are one and the same. But the one Sisko met is actually a telepathic projection of the other. The wife chick is unhappy in her marrage to the terrafromer. So in a bold gesture he flies the probe type ship into the dead sun bringing it to life, and ending his. Thereby freeing this wife from their marrige. (Actually the coolest part of the episode, and one of the best death scenes in Trek). I may be wrong on some parts, and my symmary is kinda haizy, but thats because this is all from memmory, I would not actually buy the episode, but I'm sure it's in my library somewhere."
4,Vintage Beecham.,"Beecham's recordings from the 1930s of Mozart symphonies lead the field for many decades. Excellent transfers are still available. This BBC release offers later performances from radio broadcasts given in 1949 and 1958, by which time Beecham's interpretations had mellowed. His tempi in the broadcasts are a little slower generally. In the case of No 29, however, he abandons the excessively slow tempo for the Minuet which he adopted in his 1930s recording. His reading of the ""Prague"" Symphony has gained in stature. Nos 35 and 29 receive the better recording. Loud and soft contrasts are lacking, perhaps due to the exigencies of broadcasting. The string playing throughout is silky smooth. Two of Sir Thomas's spoken introductions are included."
2,Not What I Expected,"This top was not what I expected. From the picture, it appears that the lettering on top was in glitter or stitched. The lettering on the top is neither, it is only screened onto it. I was very disappointed with this. I could have scribbled with a marker on a blank t-shirt for the same effect. This product was totally over priced and not worth the cost."
4,Acne Can be Cured,"This book was written in 1977, so while it is somewhat outdated, the author had a lot of valid points that made a lot of sense. He isn't into a lot of natural remedies for acne other than a diet low in hard/saturated fats. He goes over the diet in pretty great detail and it gives you a lot of good ideas of where you can improve your own diet. He even gives some recipes. He also includes different treatments that may help such as carbon dioxide slush, skin planing, chemical peels, surgery, skin grafting, and silicone and fibrin foam injections and a few others. He doesn't go into great detail on each of those treatments but enough for you to understand what he is talking about. Overall, I felt this was a very informative book full of information that was new to me. I would recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about what they can do to help themselves fight acne."
5,Caribbean beat,Beautiful afro-carribean music by a strong performer and even the recording quality is excellent. It's like taking a vacation in paradise.I seldom give 5 stars but this was one pleasant surprise.
5,Watina - Andy Palacio,This is an awesome album. The music of Belize is so enticing you just need to hear it over and over again. It makes you want to be in that country exploring their cultures. The artwork and layout of the cover and booklet are sensational. The best I've seen ever. THANK YOU Cumbancha.
5,Relaxing,"Phil Coulter's music is such a delightful mixture of songs and instruments. We play it while reading, studying, or on the computer. We put it on an ipod for when we travel :)"
3,More of the same,"This book could be neatly summed up by repeating the review for Welter's first book. This time, he satirizes the Secret Service, a welcome departure of milieu. Again, he dazzles with exciting and fast moving one-liners and situation comedy. When he's on, he's laugh-out funny.Unfortunately, just as in his first book, the formula begins wearing itself out about half-way through the book. Over time, a sense of cohesive plotting diminishes and the book appears to be turning into a string of short-stories. Once again, his views on relationships and the codependent pursuit of a woman savior become increasingly nauseating and embarassing.Great highpoints, and ho-hum fillers reduce this book to an averaged-out passing grade of ""mediocre."""
1,Blank pages in a book,a problem that amazon was not good at fixing. The book had many blank pages. Sent it back and received another one with the same blank pages. It was not fun having to return the book twice. Finally just asked for a refund. I would not take the chance of trying to buy it a third time from Amazon!
4,"Great lines, lead character","The book is good mainly because of the great lead character in Doyle. You like the guy instantly. The storyline does wander a bit, but it's all anchored by Doyle and makes for a great read. There are some great lines in it too, I'm surprised this hasn't been turned into a movie yet."
5,Laugh Out Loud!,"I don't think I've ever read a book that made me laugh out loud as much as this one. It's an extremely funny and entertaining book! If you're looking for a good laugh, look no further."
3,"Has its moments, but kind of tedious","This book looked great - cover blurb by Joseph Heller, comparisons to Dave Barry, a quirky title. But Welter's interesting ideas -- a top-secret baseball game between the CIA and the Secret Service, a drunken piano-playing ambassador, a national scandal over canned meat -- can't seem to rise above his shallow characters, superficial and tedious love story and dialogue that rings false when it tries to hard to be witty. Welter falls back on a lot of one-trick jokes -- like the Stealth kite, an invisible kite -- that don't advance the plot or reveal anything about the characters. With his wry Washington insider stance, Welter very much wants to be Christopher Buckley -- except he's not half as funny. Frankly, I expected more from a book brilliantly subtitled ""a tale of covert operations, love and luncheon meat."""
4,"What the heck is a ""washerwoman hairstyle"" anyway?","Okay, I still need to know that, but otherwise Welter did a great job of keeping me reading a book that is well outside my normal genre choices. I tend to read more science fiction and fantasy, but a coworker loaned the book to my partner after he was intrigued by the title, and then I just had to know what could possibly drive blowfish to seek vengeance and on whom. It's a good read, light but engaging and very funny."
2,Tries too hard and fails,"I was looking for a light, funny summer read. The reviews here failed me as did the ""funny books"" list where I stumbled across this novel. This story would be depressing if I actually cared about any of the characters. I had no sympathy for Doyle, the main character. I really could not care less what happened to him - there was no character development for any of the one dimensional players in this book. The author tries to be funny and misses A LOT - I laughed maybe once! It was a quick read, but I was very disappointed in this book and wish I had bought something else."
5,Christmas USA,"This is probably one of the best reference books on the subject I have ever read.We learn that our emerging nation didn't always take kindly to the celebration of Christmas. The Puritans saw it as a pagan ritual and so were, well, puritanical about it.Boston even levied a ban on Christmas.You learn some things that upset your preconceived notions on the holiday.Some of these are:Santa Claus - his origins in this country are influenced by a political cartoonist and a soft drink.The Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremonies - The first one was not where most would guess.How Christmas was celebrated - forget reverent gatherings at churches and think more shotguns and booze.You also learn some surprises about A Visit From St. Nicholas, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and how this nation took the holiday to heart once it realized you could make a buck.All in all a really fun read.Christmas in America: A History"
2,Nothing new,I am returning this book---it didn't have anything to tell me that I didn't already know.
1,Sugar Free??,How can it be sugar free if you use huckleberries that contain sugar and sweeten it with fruit juice that also contains sugar? Sucralose can't offset that much sugar.
2,Not for beginners,"I would consider myself an advanced beginner. This book is definitely over my level of play. Unless you are close to an advanced player or have an instructor to help understand this book, I would not recommend it."
5,Compelling and Satisfying,"I haven't read a book so satisfying on so many levels in a long time. It's perceptive, beautifully written, informative, compassionate and even, in places, funny. I couldn't put it down. For six hours on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I was transported to the cliffs of Beachy Head and didn't want to leave."
4,Guidelines valuable to everybody,"I found this book unexpectedly useful, complete and easy to read. It contains the kind of statistical knowledge that medical people do like to see. It is not another textbook that reviews medical statistics. However it provides the clues to understand and classify all these statistical jargon and processes that cause difficulties to eveybody that loves to handle statistics himself.I fully recommend it"
5,A great way to understand medical statistics,"I was impressed with the overall scope and quality of information in this book. I'm a technical communicator and understand the gap between the content people read and how they interpret and understand it. This book not only covers the most common medical statistic concepts, but it also deciphers and clarifies many terms and concepts that we commonly see when reading medical statistics. For example, it points out many common problems people run into when reporting or interpreting information, such as the ""5-year survival rate"" - it notes that this isn't a reliable measure of the quality of medical care. Another chapter warns that many studies don't have adequate sample sizes to support conclusive relationships. These added comments really help people put medical terms in perspective when they read them.The end of the book contains a helpful glossary, symbol notation, and links to other resources. This is a great tool for writers and editors."
4,Like reading an encyclopedia,"The information in this book is excellent. It does a great job covering the key points that you want to include when writing up the statistics and methods of a study. The writing is exceptionally complete and thoughtful and it has excellent coverage of topics that are rarely covered in ""user friendly"" books (like Bayesian statistics). So, the material deserves a solid 5 stars. However, the presentation, which is organized around bullet points makes the book *hard* to read. In other words, each topic is well covered but there is no flow and no-continuity. This is an absolute shame because the entire body of material is approachable to a wide array of readers. If you are looking for a text that flows considerPresenting Medical Statistics from Proposal to Publication: A Step-by-step Guide (Oxford Medical Publications)."
1,Intellectual Property,"This book is entirely too similar to C.W. Metcalf's 1992 book,""Lighten Up: Survival Skills for People Under Pressure."" Mr. Braverman should find his own material."
2,OK tools for emergency repairs...but not much else!,"I should have known...the old adage of ""you get what you pay for"" prevails. I already have a full array of high end tools, and bought this set just to keep in my truck tool box for emergencies. While, I was not having an emergency, but was not willing to walk to my shop for the correct socket size, so I decided to try out this set. Within the VERY FIRST USE, two components (an adapter and one socket) broke. No, I was not using a pipe for leverage...just normal usage. Oh well, what dya expect for the $10 or so I spent on this set. Buyer beware."
1,This thing should get negative 5 stars! horrible,"I purchased this player just months ago and it gets a black screen flicker thoughout playback and Cyberhome doesnt stand behind it's products more than a mere 90 days then you pay the labor to fix, and guess what that costs more than their cheap-o product. Take your $80 bucks and put it towards a good product... I mean you did fork up the cash for a nice HD TV, don't settle on this hunk of junk for playback!!"
3,A sad finish to a great Doctor,The Ghosts of n-Space is the 2nd of two audio adventures staring the 3rd Doctor that predate the Big Finish Audios. It constituted the final performance of Jon Pertwee as the Doctor before his death. This being the case it is sad that he would have to go out on such a poor story.Barry Letts plot is clearly one of the worst that I can remember in the series. This is a shame since Pertwee give a very strong performance with able aid from his supporting cast. The very poor Italian accents are a minus but the period situations are a plus and the best part of the 6 parts. Pertwee really throws himself into those situation and they work quite well. The Cd is also an imrovement on the rather poor photo for the cover art of the Cassette version.Unlike the other reviewers I will listen to this in my regular rotation of Dr. Who as the joy of hearing that very unappreciated doctor will override my disapointment in seeing his run end on a sour note.
1,"""something has gone terribly wrong...""","I am a big Doctor Who fan and the Pertwee years might be my favorite seasons. It was a great thrill to hear (and see, in my mind's eye) a new adventure with the Doctor, the Brigadier and Sara Jane. ""The Paradise of Death"" is a terrific Doctor Who adventure, full of fun and imagination. Buy that BBC radio play and not this one.""The Ghosts of N-Space"" is a terrible disappointment. I can't say that I enjoyed it at all except for a very few clever lines. I regret having bought this CD.I will listen to ""Paradise of Death"" many more times, I am sure. But I don't expect to subject myself to ""Ghosts of N-Space"" ever again."
3,A BBC RADIO FULL CAST DRAMA,"Everything that was right about THE PARADISE OF DEATH-the previous radio play from 1993-has gone wrong with this production. What lets it down, is Barry Letts story,which is trite, poorly plotted, and rambling. A wasted opportunity"
1,Stay away from this movie,"Here is the moral of the story as told by the, ""Dad"" car, Son there are rules in life, but I didn't stay between the lines and I turned out alright. That is almost an exact quote. Unless that is how you raise your children, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. The makers of the this movie should be ashamed of themselves for selling this to children. The characters are disrespectful to their elders, and mean to each other. They are given no guidence by the, ""Dad"" and learn no lesson in the end. A pitful excuse for a movie."
5,Cute and entertaining - worth every penny,"I got this as a gift, and I can certainly say that almost all little kids who watched it loved it. Even dogs are mesmerized by the fast action and all the zany sound effects. I just don't understand all the griping about it being predictable. Duh. So is most everything else nowadays. One thing that is certainly different from most kids movies is that there doesn't seem to be a mommy character even though there is a daddy and a son. Plus, I really love that one-armed gas pump - it's nice to see positive depictions of the differently abled in pop culture."
5,Oh my gosh...obsession,"Oh my gosh...obsession...I am hearing the mantra ""Cah Moobie?"" (""Car's Life"" movie) now about 20x a day!! Now my 2-year old is watching the entire movie all the way through (and me too!). ""Sparky!"" ""Hoses"" ""Gas Leeches"" ""Some service here!"" and the scary big eye chopper truck at the end...it fills me brain up!It's really the only movie he has ever watched - he tends to just glimpse at things like ""Madagascar"" or ""Shrek."""
1,"Pretty creepy, actually","Who is this movie for? The characters and humor could only appeal to very small children, but the subject matter is adolescence. There are any number of interchanges between between the characters that are not appropriate for little kids (for example, when the father car insists that the son car take a bath and the son shouts ""child abuse!""), and the villain continually talks about death and is trying to kill the other cars. Add to that the fact that the movie features one of the most annoying voices ever recorded and one full minute of a car driving in circles and screaming and you have one of the worst children's movies that you're ever likely to see. Not recommended for anyone except fans of the bizarre."
1,Horrid. Save yourself (and your money).,"This is the second time I have written this review. Hopefully it will make it through this time. My children of 3 and 5 love cars of all sorts. I purchased this movie based on the other review. The themes are appropriate for adolescents only. The characters are ridiculous and flat and predictable. We could not even finish watching it. One of the cars is a disturbing character who scared my children. She is constantly showing up trying to mislead the main protagonist who apparently never learns a lesson (until the very end of course). It is so predictable, boring and disturbing please don't buy this movie; wait for the real thing to come out."
1,Not appropriate for kids- Waste of Money,"The content is not apropriate for little kids..one car killing other cars? Smoking near gas station? kid car shuting ""child abuse"" when dad asks to take a bath? and the anoying voice of that girl car that I can't stand to hear anymore... Don't ever take it even if it's for Free!!!"
1,Bad in every way,"Bad animation. Horrible writing. Obnoxious voices. Awful themes. Terrible depiction of fatherhood/authority. Great movie to show your kids if you don't care about them and just want them to zone out so you can have some peace.Keep your money. Do something else with your kids. I'd sell you my copy, but we're throwing it away."
2,"a car's life, not so appropiate",The movie is very badly computerized and even shows a car smoking cigarettes! I was suprised and turned it off imediately.
1,Not appropriate for children,A character that smokes and wants to kill others? What were they thinking. This is frightening and inappropriate for young children. The story and themes are geared to teens in a medium written for preschool. Save your money.
1,NOT DISNEY. Horrible Horrible Movie,"This is the worst movie my kids have seen in years. We turned it off fairly quickly. I made the mistake and thought this was a Disney Cars 2. DO NOT BUY OR GET THIS, even if it is free!"
2,Eh...,"I was expecting a lot more from this game when I bought it. I can't even beat the first level! Don't get me wrong, I am an excellent gamer. The graphics are actually pretty good for a PSP game, it's just hard and awkward. There are only five mechs to choose from, small amount of weapons, be smart and use you money for something better."
1,Armored Core review,OK I love the first two armored core Armored core and Amromed Core Project phantasma for Playstation 1 and Mech warrior 4 for pc however in this case this is the wost game of this series is. the game play realy stinks. its unsuable. there is no missions. its all areana based. the entire thing is done wrong exept the graphics. good graphics dose nothing if the game play stinksavode it. get the Armored Core and Armored Core Project Phantasma for Playatstion 1 instead. that you will be pleased with. there is no Game Shark for PSPvideo game enhancemer is not for this PSP systemac fORMULa front stinks to high
4,purple jade,"There is the disclaimer that notes the varing depths of color in purple jade, however, I did not expect the color to be as faint/pale as the one shipped. I'm not certain, but perhaps the color deepens with age as in green jade. We'll just have to wait for quite awhile, I guess."
3,"Nice, but...","This ring looks attractive and is delivered in a nice presentation box. However, be aware that it runs about 1/2-size small. Additionally, although I don't have previous experience with jade, they seem a bit fragile/brittle to me. This ring and the light purple ring I bought my wife have already broken."
3,Good ring for the price,"Good ring for the price. Not bad for a synthetic, no lines like many synthetics have."
5,Steeler Tie Review,What a find!! I bought this for my brother-in-law's birthday which just coincided perfectly with the Pittsburgh Steeler's bid for the Super Bowl. It was better than I expected from the picture on the internet. Very fine quality - which is what my brother-in-law deserves. Perfect gift! Kathie Watson
5,My husband loves it,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. The price was right, the quality is good, we are happy."
2,The Wrong Shirt,"Unlike many Perry Ellis products, this one was of inferior quality in my opinion. Instead of the expected fine cotton finish, it is constructed of a heavy textured cotton, leaving a much different impression than I would have expected of a dress shirt."
5,Best for Seed Starting,"This fertilizer should be specifically labelled as a good choice for seed-starting. Seedlings need this precise N-P-K balance, and they need it in a much weaker concentration than an established plant does.I would never recommend Miracle-Gro! It has been found in independent assay to be quite variable batch to batch, and its nitrogen is a synthetic one, making it burn plants very easily."
2,Growth Formula?,"The name of this seems to imply it has rooting enzymes. I see nothing to explicitly state that in the description however. Looks to me like it's just a weak fertilizer: 2-1-2 is 2% Nitrogen, 1% Phosphorus, and 2% Pottassium. The Phosphorus is most typically associated with helping root growth. A better choice for general purpose plants would be Miracle-Gro. It's been around forever, and can be diluted to any strength you want. It's content is 15-30-15, so it has lots of Phosphorus compared to the Nitrogen content.James :|"
5,Love Hina: Volume 2,This book was just as enchanting and hilarious as the first. It kept me laughing and entertained. I give it 2 thumbs up and 5 stars! Can't wait to read the next volume!
2,"LIGHT AS CHAMPAGNE, OR WATER","Well, here we are, the second momentous manga of Love Hina. Keitaro Urashima, the new landlord of Hinata House, even though he has a 0% chance of passing the Tokyo University entrance exam, decides to press on anyway. Keitaro will have to sublimate his lust for the girls in his dorm and their frankly destructive tendencies to distract him from studying. He still hasn't figured out whether Naru is the girl he promised to attend Tokyo U with and vowed to marry. If that isn't enough, he's physically ill, and also finds out that he will be competing against Naru for a place in the University.To me, the novelty of this series is already wearing thin. Just writing this review reveals the shallowness and pointlessness of Love Hina. Writing about such stuff as if it really mattered. This book is at its best when it utilizes its characters, but they are all underused in this second volume. I don't know if I'll continue reading them or not."
4,Punisher Report,Very Pleased. Our son was extremely excited to get it. Arrived in good condition and in decent time.
1,not good,"its very glitchy and i have yet to make an entire recording without having a problem.also the picture is poor,i guess you get what you pay for."
1,Stinker,"If you buy this after reading these reviews you will kick yourself.Forget one-touch record (only after you select the ""yes"" in the format dialog box and then press enter and then select source).Be prepared to throw away the ruined disks. First it recognizes a disk then it doesn't. Cumbersome, confusing, and flawed in its basic design.Why was this released to the public at any price?I took mine back to the store. You will, too. Try the mini Lite-On. I got it for the same price and it is working well so far."
1,Disappointed,I'm giving this item 1 star because Amazon didn't have zero stars. Like everyone else I had the finalize problem after two months of light use. I bought the DVR1600 as a toy for only $89 but was still disappointed due to all its problems. The design is flawed. Many things such as the recording speed should be a separate button on the remote but you have to scroll down three or four windows on the screen to find it. Before the finalize problems it would often record with the audio and video out of sync. Recording at speeds other than HQ or SP are grainier than comparable speeds on a VCR. Before the finalize problems it did a suitable job making timeshift recordings not to be kept permanently. Overall it is much less useful than a VCR. It also ruined my DVD+RW discs so the DVD burner on the PC can't read them either. At least it lasted longer than the HP 530i on my PC.
1,Don't do it!!!,"I was looking forward to using this recorder after I received it for Christmas and indeed started transfering some VHS tapes to DVD. From the beginning this machine gave me trouble. It would stop and freeze up when it was trying to format a new disc for recording at 98% complete and would not respond to anything, so I had to pull the power cord to reset it. A few times I had recorded a program and when I go to finalize the DVD, it had some error and did not record. Also after about 7 months (I hadn't used it that much), It started making a loud humming noise while it was pluged in but not being used. I had to start unplugging it! Now, a couple days ago, I went to record a program and it would not even format a new disc. I tried 3 different discs (of good quality) and the stupid thing could not get past 98% complete. I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it, but unfortunately a family member did. My advice: Buy a name brand thats been around awhile, like sony etc. Sorry:("
1,stopped working,"I thought this was great, for the first week or two. Then it stopped working -- basically, it would appear as if the unit had recorded a program, but it would be impossible to play, either on this or on my other DVD player. Since it's within the 30-day window, I'm returning this one and shopping for another."
1,You can do better.,The Cyberhome DVD 300 player was a bargain and a good region free DVD player. The Cyberhome DVR 1600 is a disappointment. Even though I have used different brand DVD blanks I have only managed to record one DVD without a lock up or an error. And that DVD did not play well in my other DVD players. The unit locks up frequently when burning DVDs and needed to be unplugged to reset. The remote that was clunky on the DVD 300 is extremely awkward on the DVR 1600 and perhaps the most non-intuitive remote ever made. While others have evidently had good experiences with the DVR 1600 I have not. And while a hundred dollars is cheap for a DVD recorder it still is one hundred dollars I wished I spent elsewhere.
2,My first attemp at a stand-alone DVD recorder...,"has not gone well. I purchased a stand-alone in the first place to make it easier to archive recordings from my Direct TV Tivo (my fourth unit in in as many years, but that's another story). I did not buy it thru Amazon, but I've often used the reviews to get a feel for an item.The only reason this unit gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that it does occasionally work. That said, my successful DVD to coaster ratio is right around 1:3.The remote is far to small and has identical rows of same-sized buttons. I'd have programmed the essential buttons into my learning remote, but I think the unit is going back to the store.You get what U pay for ($99!!)."
1,= A Total Waste of Time + Money,"I don't normally write such negative reviews of electronics, because I understand sometimes you can just get a lemon. Sometimes, someone at the plant has a bad day and puts together a bad machine. Stuff happens. Nobody's perfect. BUT this machine is nothing but a SCAM, a PURPOSEFUL RIP-OFF sure to sour anyone interested in creating their own DVD library.Save your money up for something better--Amazon's got LOTS of better machines for $[...] to $[...] more. You know the old saying ""don't buy the cheapest tool and don't buy the most expensive one either""? (Okay, so maybe it was just MY Dad that said that). Well, this piece of junk is a perfect example. Sorry to say so! I'm ready to put mine in the trash."
1,Piece of Junk,"Had the same as many others:- very picky about DVD-RW-brands and unreliable (one time everything works, next time no recording at all)- freezes often during recording- after a few month did not even recognized CDs- no service from CyberHome at all.Don't buy it!I would give it negative stars!"
2,Don't bother...,You get what you pay for. When I first got the unit...it had minor digtal blips where the picture would freeze for a second then continue...I thought it was the DVR but it also did this when the video games were being played throught the front av imputs. I decided to keep it any way. I had the same problem as everyone else as far as recording dics goes...it would only play the most expensive disc. 3 months later I got up one morning and turned it on...DOA. Took it back to Target...good ridance.Don't bother with the sister product True-Tech either.
1,Finalizing Issues And Other Problems,"I would just like to say that I have had the same problems with finalizing/Unknown disk problem stated by everyone else.Now, my DVR doesn't recognize ANY disk I put in (""Unknown Disk"" or sometimes ""No Disk""). So basically I have a DVR that neither plays nor records. Right now I use it to hold the papers down on my desk so I guess it has a use, but $100 is a lot to pay for a paperweight.CyberHome's first DVR does not have the quality of their DVDs.I know SOME of you have not had these problems (yet, hehe) but the fact that so many of us are reporting the same problems is NOT coincidental and clearly indicative of a design/manufacturing flaw."
1,a piece of junk without the remote,I own the dvr 1600 and had to send it back to cyberhome 2 times for replacement wiithin half a yr. When my remote quit on me I no longer could use my Dvr 1600 because all of the controls are on the remote not on the player.So without the remote this item is junk. Thank you. by the way I contact Cyberhome to replace the remote and the remote cost 12.95 no problem but shipping and handling was from $9. to $14. that outrageous. what do you think.
1,Never buy ANY Cyberhome product!,"I purchased one from BestBuy. It stopped working a week later, after only recording one 30-minute TV show. BestBuy exchanged it. This one lasted two weeks before it hung, trying to format a disc. I took that model back to BestBuy and spent extra $$$ for a SONY. Ahh . . . finally something that WORKS!"
1,Company out of business,This company was busted for copyright infringement. It is now out of business. You can not get these things repaired!Mine worked fine for about a year. Then it refused to recognize disks. Still plays DVD's but impossible to record. Will not format disks.No way to have it repaired. Was a total waste of money!
1,Poor recorder and player.,"This thing was a hundred dollars' worth of a headache. DVD-R formatting was always an issue, with the crash at 98% completion that others experienced. Recording wasn't reliable. I ended up using it just as a DVD player, but even that degraded over time. Now it'll play maybe about half the discs I try.Junk, utter junk. And zero recourse: Cyberhome went out of business last year."
1,Useless Box of Plastic,"It worked for the first two months, viewing DVDs. It NEVER recordered pre-timed sessions. At this point I am currently in the market for a REAL DVD Recorder, needless to say I will stick to name brands and have done a few weeks of research. My advice don't but this box of plastic send me the $100 you will feel better.It is not worth a one star. DONT BUY IT!!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"The rating of ""one star"" is being generous, as this dererved NEGATIVE stars.When I first purchased this unit I was rather pleased with it. After all, I was FINALLY able to transfer my videos containing every single Watership Down episode into a more permanent format. And it was easy to use. Unfortunately, my happiness faded a couple of months later when suddenly discs started being eaten. The machine started eating discs on a regular basis. Currently I am attempting to record every episode of The Collector onto DVD as it airs each week, and am in constant fear of that ""bad disc"" messege popping up after recording an episode, as has happened with many other things I have recorded. This unit does more bad than good. I shouldn't have to record The Collector to VHS simultaniously every week to serve as backup should the DVD recorder fail.Avoid this recorder AT ALL COSTS."
1,Don't buy this recorder,"I purchased this DVR because it is lowest price DVR available. When I first got it, it was recording with picture that has 20% distortion on top. In less than a month, it was recording with intermittent pause. When I tried to play the DVD that it produced, the unit would not recorgnize it and call it an unknown disc. I tried to return it to Cyberhome. I think it did not even verify the problem and return the unit back to me. I was fortunate that I did returned it to where I bought the unit. I will not buy Cyberhome product again"
1,Don't even think about it,"Please do not bay this unit. After 2 weeks testing it, I have lost 75% of DVD+R.In 2 hrs mode the quality is good and from 2 to 8 hrs you won't see a big difference with your old tapes.After recording 2-3 hrs, it will freeze up some how, and all your programs will be erased and your DVD+R and you will have to unplug the unitto get it out. If you are ok with the 25% of chances to record a DVD, you will have to deal with the smaller remote you ever seen.Keep this unit? Don't even think about it! If your local store has a return politic, have some fun for a couple of weeks and then returned."
1,CyberJUNK!!!!!,"I bought this because it was either spend $300 or so dollars on what Consumer Reports rates as top brands (Panasonic and Pioneer)or spend $80 at Wal Mart on this thing, i tried the cheaper route only after I made sure I could return it. After my first recording I played back I noticed my recording was missing sound speratically and had digital distortion (squares and rectangles of distorted color throughout the screen). I used RCA cables to connect my camcorder directly to the Cyber@##@ so I can't imagine it was a matter of a bad connection since it would have to be all three plugs having a poor connection, and my VHS recordings from this camcorder are fine. I took it back and told the woman at Wal Mart it isn't worth the box it's packaged in."
2,Just bad poetry,"I am usually a fan of odd, sordid, and racy writings by modern poets. This one just sucks."
5,Shapiro is a keen interviewer.,"I'm reading Shapiro's book right now, and am already recommending it to folks. Each interview is tailored; the questions aren't just stock questions asked of each writer. He's obviously done some mighty research. I also love how he inserts himself, his personality, into each interview. Makes it much more personal.In other words, Shapiro creates a sense of place in each interview. I feel like I know much more about the various writers, because Shapiro makes it so easy to visualize both the setting and the process.Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"
4,Terrific Book!,"I just finished reading Sense of Place and it's just great! I enjoyed it so much,found myself relating to and identifying with so many of the authors, their trips, and thoughts, some of whom I've met, many whose works I've read.It's evocative. A splendid book. I hope it does well and that it also comes out on tape."
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps it is a matter of overblown expectations, but I wonder what the mostly well-known writers thought of their respective chapters. I found the interviews haphazard and frankly, boring. The frequent annotation ""laughs"" was particularly irritating and seemed rather amateur."
3,Decent collection of bluesy singer/songwriter fare,"This album contains some early Jeremy Fisher material, which is substantially different from his more recent stuff. Here we have a bluesy singer-songwriter who delivers a few good songs (particularly the first two tracks) and several generic forgettable songs. You can see his muse shining through and a promise of better things to come. Fisher's collection here is solid, no doubt, but a far cry from his inspiration (Dylan - see ""Song for Robert Zimmerman""). If you like bluesy stuff, you may want to give this a try. If you're a big fan of Fisher from his last 2 albums, you may want to listen to the samples first so you have an idea of what you're getting.To sum it up (because I tend to be a bit over-critical): Back Porch Spirituals is a fun (though short) album of decent, down-to-earth songs that showcase the humble beginnings of a very creative singer/songwriter."
5,A great book,"I recognized some of these stories from the Touched by an Angel series. I really enjoyed the book. The stories showedpeople going through tough situations, such as marital problems, AIDS, drug addiction, and Down's syndrome. In thesestories, we are reminded that God loves us and will never leave us, no matter what the difficulties.A very well-written book."
3,Good but rather difficult puzzle,"Our young sons received this puzzle last year for Christmas. We all love to do puzzles but this one is a bit difficult for the younger kids ages 3 or 4 because the edges are not straight so it is not your typical ""build the frame than fill in the rest"" type of puzzle. Overall, we still build the puzzle and it is BIG (with big pieces!) Now that they know how to do this puzzle, they can do it by themselves well."
4,These people have so much fun...,"...and so will you. You can buy it for just the music, but this is also a fine behind the scenes look at what clearly was joyful hard work. It's funny and enlightening. Anyone with a love for musical theater should own this. This is not a ""watch it once"" DVD."
4,Revealing Secrets,"This is a disk I bought because I am about to see a Spanish-language of the show in Mexico City and I wanted to hear how it sounded in English first. Seeing how what I suppose is the ""original cast"" recording is fascinating. At least it was to me. I have seen the original firm. What I would like is to see the Broadway musical on DVD."
5,Hilarious and Toe Tapping,"Great inside glimpse at the recording and the lively personalities. The cast has such a good vibe, and if youcan't spend a grand trying to get to the show (wellI guess the original no longer even exists) then thisdefinitely is a must. Brooks wrote a great score (I'm nota huge Brooks fan, but his off-color humor really zingsin these songs). HAHA!! Forget about the movie, watch this,it's better and fresher."
4,A nice peek at 'how it's done',"This is a 'selected' view of the recording session for the cast album narrated by Mel Brooks. It's fun to see how the various cast members gear up and put on their character's persona to get the songs across. Know that not all the songs from the show are included.But, for those not fortunate enough to see the New York cast, this is a glimpse of what the show must have felt like. It is truly a romp.As an aside, (Mel are you reading this?) what I WISH Mel had * also * filmed was auditions, out of town rehearsals, trimming & cutting the show, getting ready for opening night, and the reading of the first reviews. That would have been a happy addition to this."
5,"until they film this muscial, this is your best shot at it","Having seen ""The Producers"" with Nathan Lane I can attest he was great and the production deserved every Tony. I hope this is someday (SOON!!) filmed with the original cast. Until that day, this video is a good way to enjoy it since it is musically complete and the performers act in front of the microphones as if they were onstage.My only quibble is the idiot video director apparently never heard of ""medium shots"" (or flunked that part of video class) which are seldom used because they unfortunately LOVE closeups - especially in interviews - making the DVD soon feel claustrophobic as faces fill your tv screen with no space around them. If this can be remastered, it should be.Even so, grab it and enjoy a fun evening."
5,"Don't Be Stupid, Be A Smarty - watch this documentary!","If you love Mel Brooks' work, you'll love this film about how the Broadway hit, The Producers, came into being. A fully entertaining behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to pull a musical production together and have fun doing it! Mel is completely endearing as himself, and Matthew Broderick does a Brando impersonation that will keep you in stitches. I could watch this over and over."
5,Love Mostel.,"I Love Zero Mostel.Love, Love, LOVE.I love Zero Mostel. Love,Love,LOVE. That wisp of hair greased and combed over his bald spot, his big sad eyes,the look of greed that comes over his face when he hears about something shady. I'd like to be one of the ladies he romps with."
1,Free on PBS!,"Save your money, tape this for free from PBS. This is just another in a series of money-grabbing ploys by the producers of The Producers..."
5,An exciting and creative book with a lot of fine ideas!,"I find ""Dark Cathedral""a first rate book, I have already read it three times! Beth, the main character,is a 14th year old girl oppressed by a fanatical religious mother,until one day she finds love, magic and a more human religious belief meeting Morgan and is mother, a so-called Witch. Thanks to such an experience Beth finds her way in life, although she has to face loneliness, desperation, pregnancy and a world of mistery , nightmares and family secrets...I strongly recommend this book to people who wants to read an exciting story with three unforgettable characters!"
5,Classic knee socks,"These socks are not especially thick, but they are quite warm and come up high enough on the leg to fold over if you like. They are soft and of good quality and stay up with no problem. (I'm speaking as someone who does not have thick legs either). I have no negative critiques and would definitely recommend them."
3,good but need to be more breathable,"These socks fit well and stay up, but I find they make my feet feel sweaty more than cotton or other socks that have a mix of cotton and elastic-type material. They are also soft and warm, but I will probably wear another small sock underneath to keep my feet dry."
5,I love these socks!,"I love these socks because they stay up. I wore them all day under a pair of boots, and they never slid down. I have large calves and have trouble finding socks that don't cut into me. These are great. They aren't very thick, but that doesn't matter to me because I wear them over boots and under pants."
2,Disappointing ...,"I tried these socks because I couldn't find my usual Gold Toe knee highs. The weave on the Hue socks was much coarser than I expected. The fact that my feet could feel the coarseness was bothersome. In my experience, most knee highs eventually slip down - unfortunately, these socks seem to end up down around the ankles exceptionally fast. If you're looking for a substitute for the Gold Toe knee highs, these are not for you. If you want a pair of socks to wear with jeans on the weekend and don't mind pulling them up throughout the day, these will do the job. I was really disappointed in these socks and have relegated them to the bottom of my sock drawer."
2,NOT WHAT I ORDERED,"I ordered what was supposed to be 100% Kona Coffee,what I received was 100% Arabica Beans.This was a gift,the person I gave it to had already opened one bag.I spoke to the company and they said I could return it if unopened.Obviously I could not do that.What they offered me was a discount on what I had originally ordered,I am not satisfied with that offer.I was very dissappointed,I have ordered with this company several times with no problems.I don't think I will be ordering from them anymore.This is very unfortunate as they do have a good product."
3,Good for model review,This book is better for a general knowledge of this class of ship models and photo-etch review than the ships. If you are looking for real details on the KGV classes this is not the book you want. The in depth PE reviews and models documented made it worthwhile.
5,Music with a Message,Pure rock for the saved soul. Wish they had done more. It is worth the price and you will listen to it time and again.
2,Definitely not an alternative to Nescafe Iced Java,"When Nescafe discontinued their Iced Java coffee syrup, I went in search of an alternative. I bought a case of Coffee Time by Autocrat, because they said it was a ""sweet coffee flavor."" That sounds good, cause I like lots of sugar in my coffee. Well, Coffee Time was very disappointing. Barely any coffee flavor, and basically colored high fructose corn syrup. I bought a case of Eclipse, which their site said was a ""more intense coffee flavor,"" but I defy anyone to tell the difference between the two products. (They're made at the same site, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same product in both containers.) Now I'm stuck with 12 bottles of a product that doesn't taste very good. I have to add chocolate syrup just to add some taste to it. Pretty disappointed, but oh well."
4,"A bit expensive, but I would purchase again","I'm very happy with the battery grip so far. The vertical shutter release is great, and the extra battery time is remarkable. I keep looking down at the indicator and am always surprised to see so much battery life left. The price is expensive, that's really the only drawback, but I leave it on the camera full time and the value that I get for the work I do is worth the price. The grip definitely adds weight, although if battery life is not your primary concern, you could run with only one battery. The largest value in the grip to me is the vertical shutter release, which keeps my right hand in natural position. That's why I purchased it in the first place. Battery life was my second concern."
1,Malfunctioning item,"I just received the grip and although it fits and feels great on the camera, the shutter button is malfunctioning. When half-pressed, it not just focuses, but also releases the shutter. The same thing goes also for the on-camera shutter button as long as the grip is 'ON', making the item useless.I have read online about the issue and it is solved by returning/ replacing the grip."
4,Get a Grip on the semi-pro 5D,"The 5D is an awesome camera with superior capability, slapping the battery grip on to it gives you a much better hold on the camera, a natural vertical working platform, and some extra power. It definitely transforms the 5D from a pretty camera that your neighbor the photo bug might carry into a serious photo machine. You definitely get the respect all photographers richly deserve (!). When I carry the 5D with some fat L glass and the grip attached, I don't even have to show a pass to get access to events, the rig speaks for itself.On the downside, you would think that with two OEM batteries running you would get boatloads of long-lasting power, but it ain't so. It's better, but I'd say it gives the camera Viagra but not Cialis. The pro-level bodies have longer lasting batteries than the two dinky batteries you can slip to the grip. Expensive but worth it."
4,"Great Accessory, But....","This is a great accessory but has some drawbacks. It does add weight and bulk which are both problems for me in the field. The weight is obvious, you want to minimize the weight you drag around all day. The bulk makes it more difficult to find a case that properly fits the camera.In addition to those drawbacks, with the grip attached to the camera and a 70-200mm lens attached, the grip interferes with mounting the lens on a tripod with a quick-release. The lever for locking the quick release does not allow the camera body to be lowered enough to actually mount the camera.On the plus side, it is great to have all of the controls where you expect to find them when shooting in portrait orientation. It helps you to keep your hands in a more natural position and thus provide more stability for the camera."
3,"A good accessory, but could be better.","If you need a battery grip for your 5D, this is about the only choice. There may be some cheap knock-offs floating around out there, but I haven't seen one.The problem I have with this product is that it feels flimsy and cheaply constructed. It's way over-priced. Functionally I've had no problems, but to be honest, I don't leave it on the camera and it sits most of the time. I've read reports of owners having minor troubles with the grips causing the camera to behave improperly, but I haven't experienced this. Get it if you need it, but it's not really a necessity of life if you own a 5D."
4,No US Warranty,"Careful - this item, if purchased from Ace Digital Club does not come with a US warranty. Same unit but no US warranty.If not from Ace Digital Club, check with the provider before purchase."
2,"Too boxy, needs better ergonomics","I loved the vertical grip with my Nikon D200 so I thought the BG-E4 + 5D would be a no brainer but I find the Canon grip too bulky. Ergonomics could be dramatically improved if Canon shaved off just a few millimeters making it less boxy, and gave it a finger indentation. As it is, I leave it off camera 95% of the time and only use it on the rare occasion I need the intimidation factor shooting certain events/clients. With the battery grip, the 5D is quite a bit bigger than the 1D bodies.If you're buying the grip to extend battery life, consider that carrying extra batteries in your pocket is simple, cheaper and keeps your 5D trim and lighter to carry."
1,Site and the seller did not explain to me the truth ... What work ?!,This piece is not that I want her ... There is old piece version ..this not commensurate with my camera ( D5 ii Mrak 2).Now I am the loser Many money efficient without charge.
3,Must have accessory - marginal quality,"This battery grip is absolutely necessary for any application. It functions flawlessly.This is my second BG-E4 and without a doubt, the materials quality of the unit is marginal at best. My camera was on a tripod and took a short spill and the minor impact cracked the grip casing in two places. Bad job on my part for being careless, however the grip should have survived the short-distance, minor impact."
3,Not what I thought,"I am a wellness advocate and really like a lot of the practical information in the book. It is explained so that anyone can grasp the concepts easily. I like the nutrition, exercise, and spiritual aspects and believe that those three things are the key to ultimate wellness. I dont really see how chiropractic practice comes into play. I believe that chiropractors can indeed help a person who is having difficulties. Unfortunately this book gives a clear message that you cant have true wellness without it. I believe that if you follow good nutrition, exercise and spirituality that you minimize the need for a chiropractor."
5,Want to live well?,"This book is excellent. The fictional stories are engaging and thought-provoking. The non-fiction side is equally engaging. I experienced a difference in my life before even finishing the book. It's well-researched, down to earth and solid. I highly recommend it!"
5,The best wellness book out there!,"This is the most amazing book that I have ever read, it gets to the root of the health care problem here in america. If drugs were the answer no one would be sick. Read this book and let it change your life."
3,Silk Ribbon Embroidery for Gifts and Garments,"On the whole I was very disappointed with this book, the designs are beautiful and the projects look easy but the book presentation is lacking.Possibly to cut costs the publishers have 55 black and white pages with 8 colour pages in the middle. In those 8 colour pages there are 12 pictures that show 26 finished projects. I find that they are so small you can hardly see the detail in them.Nevertheless, there are many useful ideas and lots of sketches accompanying the project write-ups. The instructions are also clear and easy to follow. The embroidery style is fine and delicate, using silk ribbons and threads, and is perfect for clothing and washable items as the embroidery is well secured and sits quite flat.This book is a good book to buy if you want to add it to your collection, but not as a reference book."
4,Sometimes a Cigar is just a Cigar,A commentator here claims to have seen this film 50X and is prepared to see it 50X more.Few films if any (unless I am studying to become an actor) would draw that much interest.Streep does a good job playing a troubled woman who lives in the past but who is embroiled in the present that has little future for her. She does not know what she really wants and expects so much. She sure can manipulate.There are people who say that they were born in the wrong century or period. Many of us long to be someplace else that appears to have been better....more exciting. Westerns sometime do that to me. In reality a 2 hr western could be 20 years or more of ones life....perhaps not that exciting after all.I recently watched Streep in Holocaust. 1978 film.
1,Pointless,"Meryl Streep stars as a young British woman working for the French resistance during WWII. After the war, she goes home.I didn't get this movie at all. I thought it was poorly conceived and written and basically a bore. Streep was the only good actor in the cast and even she overacted a lot in a very unsympathetic role. Though the movie spans twenty years, she didn't age at all, looking young and beautiful throughout. The director chose not to have fade-outs or subtitles telling us what year it was, so we had to guess by looking at the clothing styles. Very confusing and tiresome.We do get to see a dark-haired Ian McKellen as a stuffy diplomat and a young Sting as a clueless stud. But nothing much happens in this film; it's just endless talking (it's based on a play) and nothing interesting or touching is said. Odd and off-putting, this is one to skip."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Uneven, choppy direction and convoluted plot marr the otherwise superb story and excellent performance of the uncomparable Meryl Streep. Unfortunately, not even the fabulous Ms. Streep can save this -- recommended for devoted fans only, bent on completing their Streep collection."
1,MERYL'S BIGGEST BOMB,"I rate this and ""Impromptu"" (and also maybe ""The Piano"") as films that are so impressed with themselves and their supposed pedigree they don't have to ""work"", and the results are a rather tedious series of costumes, pictures, statements and events. Maybe it was the creator's intent, but at the end of this movie you don't give a crap about this egomaniacal woman and her emotional patchwork of a life; just on the two hours you'll never get back having endured this drivel."
3,A softcore primer!,"This film includes everything you'd expect from a good soft-core, ""late nite"" effort: enthusiastic (if simulated) sex between and among glossy people in all the usual combinations: boy-girl, girl-girl, and threeway. The plot doesn't hang together all that well, but then again, movies like this aren't exactly plot-driven!The only disappointment was that the lead actress, Mia (also sometimes billed in her other films as Ava Lake or Mia Zottoli), has gone the implant route. Her natural body was just fine, but now she looks as pneumatic and absurd as altogether too many others making these films. What a shame!"
1,Sinful Temptations,"This video had such fake sex scenes it was comical. I bought it for my husband and I to enjoy together and well, lets just say instead of putting us in a romantic state it put us in a state of hysteria. Stupid is more likely what I would call this movie. Not worth the money we paid for it. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Bad Acting,"There isn't much more to say other then the acting was pretty pathetic. The erotic scenes needed some work too, I mean in some cases it wasn't physically possible for them to be doing anything to one another the way they were positioned. Not to mention the people on the cover, yeah I didn't see them in the movie..."
3,TOO BAD ABOUT MIA,"I agree that Mia did herself no good when she had her breasts malformed through implants. Her naturals were just so great. Does she actually think she looks better this way? Did she bow to the pressures of some misguided producer? Other than this small subjective complaint, it's a nice entry into the soft core genre."
4,Great Research but a Bit Too Dry,"A serious dissertation on early gin history in England and its social and economic impact on English society in the beginings of the industrial age.This book traces gin (actually Dutch Genever) which was brought back by the British troops who discovered it in Holland, through its heyday in the 18th-century in England and beyond. Almost no aspect of the social, political, or economic facets of the substance is left unexamined. A bit long-winded for a casual read, but an excellent reference on both gin and drug policy for the crazed scholars of either."
3,Good stuff,"This past winter, had the skins on my bike painted. Wanted something to protect the paint where the saddlebags go over the rear fender. I cut the film into strips to form correctly without bubbleing. A small tip, do not use a heat gun or hair dryer with this. It will curl and you'll have to start over."
3,very difficult to install,This stuff should protect but it is so thick it doesn't bend around the slightest curve without popping back off. I had to use a hair dryer to heat it to get it to form to the body lines. I have installed the invisible bra on my truck and that stuff is thinner and and a more flexible material.
4,Worked as expected,"Worked as expected. It takes a little practice to apply it to curved surfaces. Read the directions and maybe use a different squeegee, the one supplied left yellow crumbs."
1,"Good concept, near immpossible to install","I tied both the wet and dry method of instalation and neither worked. Both methods were immpossible for one person to install and when I recieved help using the dry method it still came out in poor shape. (Air bubbles everywhere. Edges would not stick when going around bends in door jamb). I would rate myself as above average (3.5 stars) when it comes to reading instructions, patience, and workmanship on this type of product.I will call a professional next."
5,Worth the Time!,A good author tells a well-rounded story -- an excellent author adds enough depth and layers to pull the reader into the story. Ross is an excellent author...
2,Night of Sin,"A baggage mixup brings together a most unlikely couple. Jonathan, a regal scoundrel, and an engaged minister's very proper daughter, Anne. When a thief plants a very valuable fossil in the girl's basket, she becomes a target for murder, as Jonathan learns when a killer breaks into her home moments before he does, and he is forced to rescue Anne, escaping with her into the night. Though they are ill matched, the demure miss turns out to be full of surprises, luring Jonathan into her arms and obligating him to her by the conventions of the day.** This blatantly illogical move of hers sets the stage for a romance that will ultimately heal Jonathan's darkened heart and soul. If you enjoyed Barbara Cartlandt, but wished it was a bit less ""nice"", then this book will fulfill your wish. **"
2,Old school detailing techniques,"While Mr. Jacobs has some technical knowledge, there is a lack of everyday, practical techniques.To win a concours, you must also have an in depth knowledge of the judging for your class and how to knowledge of paints and polishing.As a winner of several concours, I would recommend this book only as a primer, but not the ""secrets revealed"" book I had hoped for."
3,"Good starting point, but doesn't go far enough!","Mr. Jacobs' book is a good basic overview of automotive detailing, but there wasn't a lot of information in the book that I didn't already know. The section on detailing for Concours d'Elegance events was interesting, but again not overly insightful. I really not sure that this topic can be covered adequately in a 200 page book, regardless of the author."
2,lelek44,Didnt like this body butter. I gave it away. But I do like a lot of the products from this line.
1,More George W. Bushisms,"The original work ""George W. Bushisms"" was ordered to try and learn more about our President. The work showed lack of research, was poorly organized, represented adverse opinion, took quotes out of context and did a disservice to our President and nation.The book was destroyed, rather that passing it along, since it would be unfair to waste anyone's time to read it."
5,Pretty funny,Definitely makes you laugh. Don't read this at night when others are sleeping. Its hilarious to see the things President Bush Jr. said. I had no clue he made so many mistakes. I don't know for sure but I think every quote has a location and date of where and when he said it. So its all true but freakin hilarious.
3,Bush's Wisdom,It's hard to imagine that a man this stupid could actually get elected to any public office much less president of the United States.
3,want episodes listed,I would buy so many more of these dvds if they would list what ones were on the disks. I have bought in the past and have duplicated so many. Not right.
1,Lasted about a week,Tried the speakers on my stereo inside before I mounted them on our screened porch. They sounded OK for their size. They lasted about an hour on the back porch before one speaker failed.
3,Works good for the money,"This product works but they came broken, the screw holes where stripped out on 1 of the speakers, I needed to mount the broken 1 upside down. but sound is ok for the money,"
3,Good Book but a lot of repitition,"Mean Girls by DiMarco has some great points to offer and she helps spell out what different kinds of mean look like. Unfortunately, she repeats a lot of the same information in different formats and the book becomes redundant. I have been using this book for a junior high small group and it became difficult to really get into any meat after the first 3-4 weeks. For an individual girl, I think it can be helpful to label the subtle ways girls can be mean and ways they can move beyond mean to live a life committed to God first. I appreciate the way she calls it what it is and challenges teens to raise the bar in how they are living. I think watching the movie, Mean Girls, adds more to the book, even though the two are unrelated. Overall, it is a decent book."
5,Just Wut I Need,"I happy to have, cuz most of the games are just pressing buttoms but this one is really usefull i spend a lot of time dancing with the songs, i thinks im losing weight lol but thats another thing, im happy with my dance pad, y really recomend this product for ur sons or even 4 u, u wont regret buying it (y)"
2,Where are the songs?!!,"I own DDR, and I've played both DDR and PIU in arcades before. One of the big draws of PIU is that it is a Korean game vs. DDR which is Japanese. That means different songs, korean dance songs. PIU: Exceed do not have any of the korean songs from the arcade game. In fact, I will say that the selection of songs in PIU is greately inferior to the songs in DDR. In a dance-rhythm game, the song is the second most important thing next to the dance pad itself. If the song isn't good, or to your beat, you'll do poorly at it. PIU: Exceed has a collection of songs that sound generally the same, and do not have any of the club feel of the DDR songs. I am very disappointed in this game."
3,Try try again,The product is not bad IF you get good bars. The mounting brackets I got were all scratched up and looked like poor workmanship. I did receive a second pair which is why I gave them 3 stars but the product itself was just OKay
3,More interesting for the gear freaks,"Tom Marting came to my house one summer day fifteen years ago, and spent some time photographing some of my equipment so that he could update ""Rappelling."" Even though my name is in the acknowledgements, I've always felt that the book was interesting from the perspective of the variety of equipment it shows, but I don't agree with all of the content. What disappoints me most is that it does not take the broad perspective that books such as ""On Rope"" do. I don't want to drive anyone away from this book, but I can't understand awarding five stars to it either. It isn't the best - but it certainly isn't the worst either."
5,One of many masterpieces!,For the reviewer who gave this piece a one star because he cannot handle the price tag - stick with your Timex. For serious watch collectors - it does not get much better than this! Well done Breitling! Just work on making your watches a tad bit less heavy!
1,This is absolutely rediculous.,"I could not believe my eyes. A watch that cost over $23,000. That will buy me a new 2007 Toyota Camry, or the Toyota Celica. Please find some thing else to do with your money. If you cant figure out something to do with your $23,000; you could sent it to me or to my account. I will really love that. You will receive a very special, thank you from me. Holy Cow. Once again; This is absolutely rediculous."
1,bad parts,I bought the barons to save money then installed them not a easy job and the seals leaked an ruined my new brake shoes now i can't get replacement seals or a refund for this baron and amazon is no help at all probably knew they were defected is how they got them so cheep. Do Not Buy !!!!!
5,Classic Hart,"This book was originally entitled ""Life is a seventy-five cent paperback"" and the cartoons appeared in newspapers in 1970. Hart's style has changed a little over the years but if you love B.C. now you will love this book. Just as amusing is that the book has been renamed every time it is reprinted because of the rising cost of paperbacks. This one is worth at least 495 cents!"
5,Hot sparker from a hot seller,"In the middle of a busy intersection my Jeep just quit...At 180,000 miles it was not a surprise. NO spark..towed it home . After two weeks found a broken leg on a fuse..This was after spending $500.00 dollars...! this IS a new excellent sparker.it will be in my Jeep until its crushed into making pots and pans!!"
5,Colourful tale based during wonderful time in history,"I loved this book, it was very readable and it covered an area of history which I personally found really interesting.The title is misleading as the story is not centrally based around Nathaniel. This is more a collection of tales from European age of discovery. These tales are fascinating often hilarious and Milton does not spare us the true picture of the cruelity and barbarity of the time."
3,"Shipping not very fast, but great customer service","The shipping took almost the full 21 biz days, which I know is what can happen with media mail. The customer service was excellent. Friendly, fast and replied in a professional mannor."
1,does not work,"The seller is fine but do not buy this product pretty much useless, there is no difference in hair quality at all. Also product has many parabens which are not good for hair growth so the product is pretty contradictory."
2,Silly and a bit satisfying,This film was an independant crazy cover of the 70s and The Exorcist theme-films. It was not that creative - the concept is the best!
2,black bath towel,"Nice and large,softness OKWay to expensive for this towel.They are available in stores for less then 1/2 price"
5,F A N T A S T I C...................,"This is a great CD whether you are an ""expert"" in Brazilian beats or a new comer; I don't agree either with Ms. Katayama and I have a considerable huge collection of Brazilian musics.Each collection or style of music needs to be compared to its own context, and this CD is great in showing us new styles coming out of Brazil. Just listen to the great cut ""Linda Cancao"" and then you tell me what you think about it; that song alone makes this CD worth your time and money. Viva Brasil!!!!!!!!!!"
4,groovelicious,"Despite this album being a touch on the short side (a little under 50 minutes and the only reason I give it 4 stars) it still has so much to offer.Beginning as it means to go on, ""Maria Moita"" is a drum and bass influenced track that gets you in the Brazialin mood, and urges you to listen on and allows you to gain an insight into beautiful Brazilian funky soul.There are elements of hip hop and electronica as well as traditional Brazilian rhythms to provide a sensual backdrop to the start of any and every evening.I really do recommend this compilation as a way to see how Brazil has shaped the music we listen to today - for me it was an education and a non-stop ride down to the sunny parts of Brazil through a magical musical journey!"
4,I enjoy the music,"I don't remember how promptly the Cd's came, but I think they came promptly. I cared more about what the music sounded like, and I like many of the songs. :)"
2,Another Serb nationalist,Moderate Serb nationalism is the consolation prize one expects when looking for dissent from that camp. When a Serb author shows a willingness to be the first to stop making excuses and to disavow fully genocidal Serb nationalism (what a hard thing to do!) that we will have a book worth reading. This isn't it.
3,Not enough dragons,"I rented this from redbox. It is not bad overall, but it could have been a lot better. The dragons really don't come until the end. Until then, however, you do have some GREAT fight scenes. And there are lots of gargoyle dragons that pop up in the mean time.Anyone that knows me knows that I am a huge fan of dragons and dinosaurs, and we would like to see more of them!Dragons Versus Dinosaurs (Xtoriez) Adult Edition"
1,I can hardly believe my eyes,"I cannot believe what I am reading. Who in their right mind would call this an ""Enjoyable and Exciting"", ""major leap forward"", ""highly watchable and entertaining romp"", ""but still worth watching"". There is no amount of words I can use to properly convey the lack of enjoyable entertainment. So let me just point out that the pirates wear sweat pants and the leading lady Doc Martin boots complete with tread pattern. I believe the positive reviews are from family and friends with the aid of a large helping of pharmaceuticals. This is no B movie. I like B movies. This is a couple of cell phone cameras and a handy Goodwill near by for costumes."
5,No counselor should be without this book!,This book is excellent. There are so many excercises to pull from. I've met the author (s) and the book was written so that items could used by the purchaser in their individual work.
5,Excellent Resource!,"I purchased this book in 2008 while working in a residential home with children ages 6 - 12. I ran a group for children who were sexually and physically abused and almost all of the activities I did with the children were taken from this book. I tweeked them a little to fit the general theme I was using. The kids LOVED this group! They actually looked forward to it! The activities got them thinking and processing their own abuse history's. Even the residential staff were impressed, and they told me that several of the kids actually ""opened up more"" to them after participating in this group. I have since used activities in the book in individual outpatient therapy sessions when appropriate. I can't recommend this book enough!"
5,Same as the $140 version,"Quick review. Awesome Series, many reviews have been written about this for the individual discs and the other version of the complete season 1 set (the $140 version). Only difference I find in this set is the new slimmer packaging, all six discs come in an interestingly economically designed pack (about as wide as say... a Lord of Rings Collectors set of Fellowship of the Rings). But, these ARE THE SAME discs with all the extras including the outtakes and production art. One annoyance perhaps, the disc art is also the same, so there is no description of what episodes are contained on each disc... Just the title given to the disc when they were being sold individually. Thought I'd write this since I couldn't find any other information on this set and what was already out there prior to its release."
3,Berserk anime,Being a huge fan of this anime i was very upset to find out the last 2 (most important) episodes were not working. At first glance everything seemed fine about the disc but upon close inspection i found it was cracked in the center.
5,Highly recommended and welcome viewing,"Saul Of Tarsus was a powerful, articulate, implacable enemy of Jesus and his followers. He was a man dedicated to determined to stop the spread of the Christian message by any and all means possible. Then he had an encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus which utterly altered his destiny, life's mission, and even his name. This was an encounter that not only changed the newly renamed Paul, but irrevocably altered the course of history itself. The Story Of Paul The Apostle is a beautifully produced, 70 minute, full color documentary that takes us from Paul's education in Jerusalem under the Rabbi Gamaliel, to his founding of Christian communities throughout the Mediterranean, to his ultimate martyrdom in Rome. The Story Of Paul The Apostle is highly recommended and welcome viewing."
4,"Seat height about 29""","This is exactly what I was looking for as a portable stool for rehearsals - I play the string bass. The stool stays in the back of my crossover all the time...so much better than dragging my heavy wooden stool around.Folding stools are almost impossible to find, and when you do, they are too short - 24"" (counter height.)The product info only gave total height @ 38"" - seat height is 29"".I wish the seat had some padding, but overall, the item is great (and I have a spare.)"
3,good if you dont have a lot of stuff,"or have to access it was much. You can't switch shoulders, its rather small and a pain in the you know what to access when needed. I ultimately bought it for bike riding in which it's perfect and leaves your hands free. I wouldn't use it for going around the city."
1,Horrible video quality,"The video quality on this DVD is horrible, it might as well be VHS or beta for that matter. One would think the time and effort to burn the HD version would be no longer than a low quality version."
1,Not much here. Pass on this one,If you want something really good try the HGTV Before or After. The best is really the Home Decorators Bible. Martha's books are often cut & paste jobs.
2,I was disappointed in content.,"I should have known that decorating ""Martha-style"" would not be my style. Her passion in finding the ""old"" at bargain prices and making it ""work"" for her is not what I call decorating. She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't. However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book. If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe. I've seen and heard it all before."
5,Anger in all its many forms!,"This book had a dramatic impact on my life... and also on my husband. Even though we both handle anger VERY differently, we both found extremely helpful information here. Dr. Carlson effectively demonstrates how anger has many faces and expresses itself in many different ways. Most importantly, he explains so clearly how anger is really an expression of either hurt or fear, and gives examples of healthier ways to express the fear or hurt so we don't feel driven to turn it in on ourselves or outward against others.I HIGHLY recommend this book if you feel overwhelmed (or even underwhelmed) with hurts or anger in your life."
5,I was clueless!,"From an earlier review: <<this book could be useful for those that are ABSOLUTELY cluless. Say, for example, my mother.>>Had to laugh; that's me! I've got grandkids this kids age. I checked this out at the library, renewed it twice, and had to HAVE it. I especially liked that it's equally good for Macs and those others. This got me through getting my first web site up and running -- I don't intend to use it for marketing or anything else high traffic. This book gave me everything I needed as well as some pointers about how to go further if I ever want to."
1,reviews are WRONG....this book focuses on FrontPage Express!,"I bought this book because I wanted help working with Netscape Composer. The reviews indicate that this book focuses on this shortware. Unfortunately, the Second Edition (1999) does mentions Netscape Composer twice and includes ONE page discussing Composer. The rest of the book deals with use of FrontPage Express. I'll be returning this disappointment."
4,View from a Novice Website creator,"I find this book very helpful for someone who has not ventured into Web creation as yet. It gives pointers on how to put your site together, alerts you to the fact that ""not all browsers are the same"" and you need to be diverse in what you produce. The references and glossary are very good. I would highly recommend this book to get your site started. When you have gotten your feet wet, then you can move on with confidence to more high-powered web building."
1,Poorly written,"Dr. Lucas's text book on dinosaurs is hopelessly muddled and poorlywritten. He cannot decide what his audience is or needs. He alternatesbetween positions and is often vague in his statements. He cannotdecide whether he's writing historically or analytically, for adults,for children, or for scientists. The result is garbage. Where was theeditor?"
1,it misses the whole point!,"What kind of book is this? It don't mention the bible at all. I never done seen a place in the bible that talked about dinosaurs and what not, and so i don't believe in them critters anyway. I once saw a man take a rabbit skelerton and a wolf skelerton and a buzzard skelerton and make it all look like an angel skelerton. I got this here bible and there was nothing in there about the bible or jesus, who we know fought dinosaurs and pterodactyls. Weird, eh?"
5,Debbie Macomber,I loved this book. Both stories were well written and held my attention. I love happy endings and that's what you get.
4,classic Christmas tales of love and happiness,"This book has two stories in it that are filled with the expected charm of any Debbie Macomber holiday book. They are, of course, filled with the usual amount of silliness and centered around events that would more than likely never happen in the real world. It is that, though, that makes them such a joy to read during the holidays. The idea that everything can go right for someone and they can find what they have been searching for their entire lives during the holiday season, is a sweet and romantic idea that Mrs. Macomber has revisited time and again. Although some of the elements of this book reminded me of her previous novels, I thought this book was a great, light holiday read, perfect for an evening by the fire. Sometimes, when you need an escape from holiday stress, a Debbie Macomber title is just the right medicine and this is no exception."
4,Warm stories to delight the heart,"Two very cute stories in 1 holiday package. Debbie Macomber has an excellent talent to create warm and lovable characters! ""When Christmas Comes"" had a charming plot and somehow very believable. ""The Forgetful Bride"" captured a lovely sense of humor! Debbie Macomber also has the knack to create a male lead with a WONDERFUL sense of humor. It makes for a very SEXY male!"
1,Home for the Holidays,"If I had it to do again, I would have saved my money. This is a very easy read and very light hearted, which is fine. What I didn't like the book is something I would expect a 16 year old to write. The behaviors of the lead female are very childish and not the behaviors of an adult. For example, who would tell their boss that at the age of eight you had a pretend marriage and you didn't want him to be concerned about it. Honestly -- This is one example but the juvenile writng made it a challenge to keep reading"
1,Predictable,"I love Debbie Macomber and her books, but I was disappointed with Home for the Holidays. Unlike most of her books, I didn't find the characters or the storyline believable. I couldn't finish either story. I wouldn't recommend this one, not even at Christmas."
3,An ok christmas book but predictable at every turn,This is my first romantic comadey book to read but I wanted to read an x-mas book but all of them are romantic comadeys. I found this book to be pretty good. The book has 2 stories and the first one was ok and the second was good. The first one I found the charactors to be anyoing at first the main girl was to mean and the guy was to kidish. As the story went on i liked the chemistry between the two charactors. The story was good but predictable and it draged on at times. The other story is a mix up holiday story which I found fun. The story was funny but predictable but fun. Overall the book was a good x-mas book but still needs lot of work.
3,An interesting story,"Miss-conception is an odd little movie telling the tale of a woman who owns a construction company who shortly after breaking up with her man over his not wanting children finds that she only has a single egg left to have children with.Her maternal clock on overload she goes into overtime first trying to find her man (who went to Ireland to film a documentary) and then to try to find a man, ANY man to be the right father/contributor.As you might guess it leads to a comedy of errors and a bit of discovery for both her, her friend and her man Zack who owns the most poignant of the film in an encounter with a young nun in an Irish convent.I don't want to give away too much of the plot, bits and pieces of it are predictable but the movie does have its moments. Never in the history of modern film has it been so hard for an attractive woman to get laid.It might be worthwhile as a streaming download but I don't know if its a buyer."
2,Mix reviews all around!,"Not many reviews for this one and they all are pretty mix. This movie I felt wasn't as good as other movies I have seen. I thought it would be a funny movie too, but it wasn't that funny at all. It really boring at times. I only gave it 2 stars because I think Heather is HOT! And, we get to see her in a bra that's about it. lol"
1,This was the most annoying movie ever.,"Ok. no wonder this movie only cost .99 to rent, because it was HORRIBLE...Heather Graham once again has sex all the time in this movie trying to get pregnant, her british accent sucks and the whole movie plot just confuses you...save your dollar and go buy a burger at mcdonalds."
2,Very average,"The quality of the dvd cover and case was very average, not to mention what a disaster the movie was"
4,Outdoor entertainment,"These speakers are ideal for outdoor entertaining, they sound good in our 800sqmtre section,i cant comment on waterproofing yet,as its summer in NZ so am waiting to see if these last, hoping they do."
2,Pyle Home PDWR50B 6.5 Inch Outdoor Speakers,"Bought these speakers in August, 2012. Speakers have a fairly good sound. Major problem with the Mounting Hardware, very flimsy. Unable to fully tighten speaker to mounting bracket. Probably should avoid buying and look at other products."
1,Do not purchase for boat use,"Lugs to secure the speakers are too long and, as a result ""bottom out"" before the speakers are tight to the mount. Result is speakers that will not hold in position and actually swing wildly about. Mount brackets bend due to speaker weight in minimal rough water. These may work great around the pool but are not suitable for boat use"
2,disappointed,I should have returned these speakers but time just flew by! There's hardly no bass. They sound pretty good but if you love bass then please don't purchase these speakers. For now they'll have to do for the price I paid.
1,Sound quality is very poor,"If you care about sound quality, these speakers will not do it for you. I am used to Bose, Polks, JBLs etc. These are pure junk comparatively sound wise but what do you want for 50 bucks... You get what you pay for, a very, very bad sounding pair of speakers, all mid range, sounds like an old AM radio, all you need is the static. They sound like the single cone paper AM radio speaker mounted in the dash of your grandfather's old 1975 Plymouth Volare. On the good side, they are built more solidly than I expected, the brackets are weak though."
4,very informative,I appreciated the info brought out here. Things I wasn't aware of are typical of these series of books. Eventually they will all be mine.
4,score me the ages....,"Don't worry, I gave the first CD 4 stars too! This sophmore effort is just as stellar (pun intended)! Pure-quality vocalist trip-hop combined with slow-motion breaks defines this duo.The first disc is a planetarium-show soundtrack; this one is Black Box Recorder on Soma! Sensual, slippery, sweet & spacy. Seduce someone with music that scores the ages!"
3,What do you expect?,"The Starseeds debut album, ""Parallel Life"" was a masterful example of the powers of simple elegance in production and has become a mainstay in my collection. In their follow-up album, more focus is placed on the vocalist and less on the cohesion and flow of the album as a whole. So moved by their first release, I feel this follow-up may have been an inevitable let-down for me."
2,A bit disappointing,"Im not a major fan of The Starseeds but I decided to buy their second CD based on the fact I liked 4/5 track off 'Parellel Life'. The new Cd started well with a a commercial sounding song 'Starman', the second track is cool and I love the wah-wah guitars. After the following track the album goes downhill and I lost interest soon after that. I hope Starseeds release a better third album. Buy only if you want a few good tracks for your money."
5,"Very nice ""mini"" vacuum cleaner toolkit","I like. Very nice vacuum cleaner set. The long, flexible tubular tool fits into dryer's lint trap; when nothing else gets lint out of dryer's lint trap, this gets it. Well worth $13. I'm sure I'll be using this set to get at tight places for a long time. Robust materials. Would recommend."
5,Awesome toy,"This toy is lots of fun. Ace is very sharp-looking, the paint job on him and the hyenas is very well done. The 'Ace Racer' is cool (though the hyena launcher is easily forgotten). Basically, it's a good toy to get, and it doesn't annoy you with repetitive phrases like the other Krypto figures."
4,Ace is aces!,I love this line and I hope it does well. This Ace is awesome. I love that he comes with his flyer and especially with Bud and Lou! I only wish that Bud and Lou were jointed and possible as opposed to being PVCs (very weighty pvcs I might add). Buy these toys and maybe Fisher Price will make more Krypto figures.
5,The Perfect Stranger,"The Perfect Stranger shows what a modern encounter with a physically present Jesus might be like. Scripturally sound in the presentation, appeals to teenagers and adults alike. These movies ( and the books they are based on)have opened doors for sharing the gospel with people who do not respond to ""preaching"". I recommend them for everyone, whether you are a Christian or especially if you are not!"
5,The Perfect Stranger: Director's Double Feature 2-disc set,"These movies are incredibly good, they help answer questions we have about faith and Jesus. Of course the Bible is the best source, but these movies do a pretty good job."
5,DVD with a message worth thinking about,"We love the Stranger series and find it a refreshing, meaningful change of pace from just plain ""entertainment"" videos. Thanks."
5,Great value,This double feature is the best value for money I got in a long time. Not only is it soft on your pocket but the stories are speaking to your soul. Great DVDs!
4,""" a must see""","I really enjoyed these movies.If you enjoy movies or books where a stranger actually has a sit down conversation with Jesus ,this would be one of them.I would highly recommend this movie to use perhaps, for a discussion topic at a bible study.It is very informative dialogue, that gives some great answers to some pretty tough questions .You may hopefully come to know and accept Jesus as your personal Father."
4,The Things We Are Capable Of...,"This movie is unbelievable; very well told and acted. However, I don't recommend it for the weak at heart as it is a true story about a tragic event from the Mid 60's.After this movie my very soul ached at this story's theme ...displayed so vividly and actually once upon a time - committed!!I had to adjust my emotions after this movie...""LIFE!! It's can be so crazy; the unimaginable things we do to each other sometimes!!"""
3,TOO KIND FOR THE OFFENDERS,"I have just watchted ""An American Crime""(the movie) Although some of the back ground was correct, with respect to the street scenes(although they never actually showed the house where the atrocity took place).It was torn down a few years ago. What actually happened at that address, to Sylvia Likens, should be recourced. My childhood was not so different, except nobody killed anyone. I've talked to my mother, and I've tried to talk to other people,but no-one seems to want to acknoledge there upbringing.I grew-up in Indiana, in New Palestine Indiana. The day that Sylvia Likens was found dead was my brother's(16th) birthday. Only a few days from my own b-day.Sorry Pete"
3,An American Crime,"I wished that I had not brought it. It's not as good as The Girl Next Door, which this movie was based on the real Crime that happened to a young girl. So much was lefted out."
4,"Hard to take, but not to be missed","Powerhouse acting by Ellen Page and Catherine Keener, plus sensitive, intelligent direction by Tommy O'Haven, make ""An American Crime"" a must-see for aficionados of the true crime genre. A skillful balance between straightforward storytelling (a hallmark of the genre) and a handful of creative flourishes that season rather than undercut the truth of the story (I'm especially thinking of a heartbreaking ""what if...?"" scenario near the end of the film) combine to deliver a memorable package. Just be prepared for an almost unbearably sad and tragic story. The DVD features excellent image and sound, but unfortunately no extra features of note. I would have liked to see a half hour or so featurette, laden with interviews with the real people involved in the case, so we could get the ""story behind the story"". But don't let that shortcoming of the DVD stop you from seeing this extremely well-crafted film, if you can take the subject matter."
4,very touching story,"This movie, although not totally all factual, gives a very touching story about Sylvia Likens and the tortured young life she had.I bought both the DVD & book(not same title) & I believe if this isn't one of the most horrific crimes ever committed, I don't know what would be.I lived in Indianapolis as a child, when this happened, about 6 blocks from where it took place.It was such a ""horrendous"" crime, especially in those days, I will never forget it.I am glad to see Sylvia's story was finally told.Wish one of the crimes shows would do a follow up on where all the ""participants"" are now."
4,Great movie but very disturbing,This is a great movie but a very sad story. I thought the acting was very well done but if you can't stomach all of the abuse that was going on then you shouldn't watch this movie. I saw the girl next door as well and that movie was a lot worse. This movie didn't show as much abuse as TGND but it was still a little tough to watch.
3,Soooo Sugar Coated,"They didn't show half of the atrocities that little girl was put through. They things that they did show were changed to make it more bearable to watch. That is not a bad thing though. If they had shown what really happened to her I wouldn't have been able to watch it. If you want to know what really happened to Sylvia, read House of Evil by John Dean. It's repulsive and infuriating but it's the truth. If you can't handle the whole truth then this movie is close enough."
1,not recived,"I have not recived this movie I got my other two that was in this order. The burning bed vhs movie was broken the lip of the vhs was busted in two, and i have not recived an american crime? I have order befor in the past with no problems at all now iam haveing problems with this movie an another movie no one would tee i still have not recived this movie also whats the deal with amazon?? I want my movies (AN AMERICAN CRIME ) and (NO ONE WOULD TELL) in a timeley matter or you can refund all of my money for these movies and the broken movie the burning bed. iam very upset at the moment fix the issue"
3,"Not the most horrible story, but ...","2007R: If you ever thought of becoming a psych major you'll find lots of thought provoking material in this disturbing film based on a true story. Certainly not the most horrible story, but damned close to it. A real testament to the damaging affects a mentally disturbed parent can have on those in their charge. MFJLabs 3x"
4,a hideous crime indeed,very sad to know this can and does go on in our country. This movie was verymoving and leaves you wanting the justice system to its job
3,Good movie,It was a good movie. I have read a book about what happened and I was excited to see a movie about it.
5,incredible,"you hear about things happening in today's society and it is because no one says anything, this crime could have been prevented by so many different people. Outstanding Movie."
5,Different,"This was a disturbing but well produced movie. I know that this is based on true events, and its amazing that some, even if a little bit of this had happened to someone. But, overall a great movie."
1,can't tell much about the movie because the transfer is the pits,"from what little i could make out,this may have been good. i can't say because this is so poor that at times you can't hear a thing and the static and grain are all over the picture. the pits leave it alone and spend your money on something worth while"
1,Corregidor,"As a fan of World War 2 Movies especially those made during theperiod 39/45 I must say that I thought the people who had thisexample up for sale should be prosecuted for the pathetic qualityin image , its an insult to ones enteligence . I am all for oldmovies to be remembered , but in this case if they could not havefound a better copy to sell ,it degrades the film to a level which it does not deserve . DVD is supposed to be reasonablequality , this example is disgusting . To have the nerve to offerit for sale is unbeleivable ."
1,corregton,"movie was a love movie not really a war movie, would not show it to any of my friends. very poorly done."
2,Not overly thrilling,"This movie should never have been produced, it is that awful. The characters are not too good in their roles. There have been better movies regarding the drama of the conflict there."
3,World War II Movie,The movie quality was not good. Story line is typical of war movies. Very little action.
3,Informative but Old,"A reliable book for any beginning or aspiring freelance writer. It has many good tips and tools to help start a writing career. However, this book is relatively old. The copy I have is dated 1981. I have no clue whether there have been more recent editions. If the reader can ignore the fact that the writer has no knowledge of computers, the internet, or anything circa 1982 and beyond they may find it to be useful. I'm sure that there are more recent books written on this subject though that would be much easier to obtain and may have more accurate information on the current publishing industry."
5,A film well worth the purchase,"John Grooters does a fantastic job in bringing this movie together. I was fortunate enough to have nearly the entire movie filmed in my hometown, so i was able to be there for a lot of the shooting and casting. When I saw the action packed, thrilling, comical, outstanding feature all mixed and edited, I felt honored to have a part as an extra in this movie. You'll find yourself laughing, sitting on the edge of the chair, and possibly crying through this great film. Not to mention, the soundtrack to this film is extraordinary! No matter what you believe, The Frontier Boys is a must see film suitable for a family movie night."
5,Don't Miss!,I was so surprised! It is a must see. I love that there is a Christian movie about the struggles of teenage boys! Finally a movie that has role models for our youth. I can't wait to have my own copy.
5,Best ever,This is a great movie! Rebecca st james was amazing as always cannot wait to get this when it comes out :)
5,Great story!,"How does a young man deal with attempted murder in his own neighborhood? How does the Bible ""fit"" in a mean and mixed up world? Frontier Boys is a real life action adventure of faith that is gripping, warm and unforgettable. I highly recommend it to go into the homes of everyone you care about."
4,"Fascinating to read, tasty to eat!","I love this cookbook. I started watching Kylie's show on Discovery and have gotten both her cookbooks. I am currently working my way through the recipes and have yet to find one my family doesn't like. Plus, I love to just sit down and read her stories, she writes so vividly you feel like you are right there with her. I especially like the listing in the back of the products she uses, and the brands she recommends. It made it much easier to go my local Asian store and find exactly what I needed. The only problem is having to translate cooking temperatures from celcius to farenheit and she uses grams instead of ounces/pounds in the measurements. BUT, it is worth the few minutes hassle of converting to what I need, so I don't really mind it too much."
4,Fun cook book with family stories,Kylie is inventive and fun. Her stories made me read her book cover to cover!
3,Worth the read...,"I cannot say that this book is a waste of time to give it a one star rating but also cannot give this book five stars as it was written while Maxwell was alive and most certainly a book of glorification and personal attest to the persona of British Media Baron Robert Maxwell.The book is a very good base for an in-depth look at him and his, above board, business practices. Due to most, if not all, the rumors and facts surrounding his death, Czech aid to Israel and fraudulent investment practices, which were common of the day, from corporate pension funds are not discussed within this read.Should one want a more in-depth review of Maxwell over and above what is written on Wikipedia, this book is a sound base. It is in-depth, rounded and not nearly as bad as this fellow who presented a 1 star....surely worth 3 but too much as passed since this was written that keep it from being anything above a 3 imo. Happy Reading..."
1,Waste of Money,"One thing I can say for Alpha Video. They somehow have a distribution that gives them the funds to continue to put out junk. These two movies were heavily compressed to less than a single GB and worse, the opening and closing credits are freeze-framed, the company superimposed their logo in the corner and added sound effects to the soundtrack. In other words, if you are a purist, don't buy this DVD. Quality isn't very good and it's been seriously altered. The same movies are available from other companies (also being sold on Amazon.com) and you'd do better buying the same movies at better quality."
4,A Treasury of Children's Literature,"I found the book delightful. It was what I had exspected. I had recently been to an exhibit of Maxfield Parish, which brought back memories. I wa not dissapointed."
4,CL under the Aegis of Nonfoundational Social Constructionism,"Although I don't agree with the nonfoundationalist point of view, there is much to ponder and learn from Bruffee. If one delves into WHY they don't agree with his thesis, they'll probably come away from the exercise with a far better understanding about their position vis-a-vis education-perhaps they'll even develop their own philosophy of education.However, believers beware: if you agree with the concepts outlined by Bruffee and the nonfoundationalist camp, check the other side of the coin (cognitive, essentialist, traditionalist) before committing."
2,good for general fitness but not so good for baseball/softball,"Length:: 6:14 MinsTo all softball players, coaches and parents:In this video review, I explained that I'm very qualified to review this product and why I strongly believe that this book is not specific enough for softball players and is better suited for the general population.Reviewer's credentials:- Experienced Softball Coach (over 20 years of softball coaching experience including the international and college levels)- Certified Strength and Conditioning Coach (over 10 years of experience training and conditioning softball players)"
5,Wonderful Book,"This book has been absolutely wonderful for me, as well as the rest of my team. I'm hitting the ball further then I ever have before. The difference was evident in weeks. Truly the single best program out there."
2,Another Reader,"I question the premise of the books criticism.One cannot blame the inadequacies of the modern city on one or two architects (Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe). Those revolutionary architects were purely responding the changing environment that surrounded them; namely the industrial revolution.To continue to construct buildings and plan communities as they were a thousand years ago would be akin to using wax paper for windows and traveling via horse (as Solomon suggests). Fortunately technology does indeed affect us all and Architects have a responsibility to respond to it accordingly.I do agree that there are numerous problems with today's cities but turning the clock back to more idealistic times is not the answer, as the self proclaimed ""New Urbanists"" say."
5,Music of the Heart,"This is music inspired by the mystic tradition within Islam, the Sufi tradition, reverent music, infused with joy and love. I listen mostly to hear the depth of this man's heart. One of my favorites!"
3,Cute but small,This tub is cute and serves its purpose fine but is a little small for my taste. My daughter is 7 months and we have only used it a few times. You can't really fit toys in the tub with the baby. My daughter likes to move around and splash at bath time so she doesn't really enjoy when we use the duck.
4,Worked well for what we needed,This tub worked great for an interim tub for our son. He was too long to stay in the infant tub until he could sit up by himself. Only down side is that it is big and the suction cup didn't hold it up real well.
4,thermometer doesnt work,"Great product but the warning always says the water is too hot, even when its cold.. I just ignore it now but otherwise its great"
4,The Duck Tub is a Hit!,"Our daughter takes most of her baths in the kitchen sink as it used to be the only place she would bathe without screaming the whole time. Now that we have the ducky tub and have started using it, she loves it and has a great time. We still do baths in the sink (easier to wash her hair), but most of our baths are in the ducky; the quacking makes her laugh! I must have the water at the right temp all the time though - I've never seen the ""hot"" indicator react at all, which is not the case with our rubber ducky temp indicator. Still, it's a great little tub!"
4,My son loves the duck bath!,"My son outgrew his infant tub, so we found this inflatable tub and thought we would give a try. I would recommend using it once your baby can sit up unassisted. It is easy to fill and has a hot indicator to tell you if the water is too hot. The only downfall I have found is that the plug is hard to press in. My son loves his duck tub and is 10 months old and he still fits in it. I would say he will be in until he is 1 year."
5,It's a nice shade of bright yellow,"This picture makes it look neon green which is the only reason I was hesitant to buy it. My son is 15 months, 32 inches long and 26 lbs. and this was too small for him. It's very cute and well made so I will keep this so I can fill it up with water on hot days for him to splash in."
1,It sucks,I have totally bought four Munchkin inflatable safety duck tub. They all leaked at the same place (under the beak) after several months of usage. Wondering othe parents have the same problem?
3,Small.....,"I purchased this tub after the Snug tub we were using got a hole in it. The tub is very cute and my baby loves it, but it is so small. I can't even lay her down to rinse her hair without her legs being out of the tub (she's only 27 inches long and 15 lbs). I should have bought another Snug tub because I love the size."
5,Great for baths,I love this colorful duck that keeps my baby from slipping when taking his bath. He stays put when I place him in the tub whichmakes it easier to relax and he can have fun also. I love it!
5,What's Not to Love about the Ducky Tub,"It's practical, inexpensive and fun. It has a drain that is easily popped and a suction cup so you can hang it dry. We originally purchased a bath ring/seat but we found it was a waste of water to fill an entire tub for such a little baby. The ducky tub offers all the support an early sitter needs and has a reclined tail for shampoo rinses. Baby loves when I make it quack. Great product!"
4,Lucky Ducky,A friend of ours recommended this inflatable duck tub....great value! We took it with us to Disney World and our 4 month son bathed in it every night. It even quacks! We were super surprised at how easily it inflates and deflates. Packs very compact for trips. We are very happy with the purchase :)
4,My baby loves it!,"My baby is 6 months old now and he outgrew his newborn tub. He was tired and cranky on it, now he's happy with this munchkin tub. He plays on it for almost 30 mins every night while I bathe him, it's like a spa for him. The only issue I find is he needs a lot of supervision, he moves a lot and he went underwater once by mistake, so I have to be super careful, but when don't you have to be super careful with a 6 month old! :)"
4,Comfy Item for baby...,"We bought the item before a trip to the Tropics. It came on time -as always with Amazon- and my 7month baby loved the inflatable, was comfy for him and he loved taking baths with it. Only thing was that once there, we noticed that it didn't hold the air very well, so we assumed it was punctured but it was so small that we couldn't find the hole. Since we never tested our before we left on vacation we never could notice if it came like that or it was punctured there (almost impossible as was used ALL the time far away from uneven surfaces or things that could deflate it).All in all, loved the inflatable and most of all, loved the circle that goes white when water is hot for the baby."
4,great choice for special needs,"We have friends with a daughter who is hdrocephalic (fluid collects around her brain) and has a shunt (tube running from her head to her belly to drain the fluid). Since it's very important that she not bang her head, this tub was a great choice for them. They feel much better about bathing her in an inflatable tub, since she is much less likely to injure herself or damage her shunt while taking a bath."
4,I bought two!,"I found this at Target and decided to try it out for my parent's house. It was really cheap and cute so it wasn't a hard decision. I liked it so much I bought one for my house.Pros:- Easy to inflate. I did it all by myself. It didn't take long at all and I didn't feel dizzy afterwards.- There's a suction cup so you can hang it up once you're done. This works well in a big bath tubs or shower stalls.- Soft surface so your babe can rest his little head on the side of the duck as your wash his hair.- The bottom of the tub is ribbed so you have a lot of friction, preventing your baby from slipping.- the hot temperature sticker is great. However on my mom's tub it's very sensitive.- The beak makes a cute ""quack quack quack"" sound.Cons:- Sometimes I wish the duck's head was detachable. It can get in the way sometimes but it's not a big deal.Bottom line: I would buy this again for a friend or myself if needed."
2,A Bit Unsafe for Young Babies,"I was very excited to get this tub. My 7 month old daughter loved sitting in it without any water. On day two when I used the tub she tipped over and hit her head on the tub. It had already deflated a little bit. Turns out we had to refill it everyday to prevent this from happening. We exchanged it for a new one. Problem solved. It was losing air too quickly. However, it still loses a little air each week and you have to make sure to fill it up to capacity or your little one will tip. When our baby gets really excited and splashes around, she loses her balance even when it is full. We've had to pad the bathtub with towels to prevent her from whacking her head. It makes me a bit of a nervous wreck. I wish it were a bit more sturdy."
2,Rips easily,"I've purchased 2 of these tubs, and both have gotten small rips/holes. So small, that it's impossible to find and repair with the included patches. Until both of these tubs ripped, I loved the product, which made bathtime for my one year old enjoyable."
5,Cutest Tub,My little boy absolutely loves this tub. It's just the right size for that in between stage from the baby tubs to the big tub. He feels very secure and has so much fun splashing and playing in this tub. He also loves the quacking noise it makes when you squeeze it's beak and he'll point at or touch the duck's head to get you to make it quack. Great product and a great price.
4,Safety Duck,My daughter loves the Safety duck. And it's high enough that I don't have to bend down so far to bath her.
4,"Great product, kiddo loves it","I bought this tub when we were strapped for cash and couldn't afford more pricier tubs. I was very pleasantly surprised, because it is a really great baby tub. The main drawback for me was blowing it up, but even that didn't take long. Although apprehensive at first, my daughter now loves sitting in her ducky tub and splashing around in the water. One minor con is that the temp gauge thingy doesn't accurately depict the water temp. Even lukewarm water was shown as hot. But I believe parents have enough sense to know what's hot and what's not for their kids and know better than to rely on that little circle."
3,works but has leak in head,"Bath tub works but, we noticed a leak in the head and had to have it exchanged. When the air stays in, it works great."
3,works for the price,"I got this for my 8 month old baby - she outgrewThe First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue, and is still too small for the big tubPros:So easy to inflate maybe 2-3 minutes and it was readyI like the suction cup to hang it- although it usually falls down at some point, at least it stays up long enough to dryI can use this on my kitchen counter top or in the bath tubComes with repair patches- which im not sure if this is a pro or con- are they anticipating leaks??Really cuteEasy to travel withCons:For some reason the one I got doesn't 'quack' I was kind of bummed even though it really doesn't matter (still debating if I should exchange it)The cover has to be closed just right you have to check it thoroughly otherwise water will leak out I found this out the hard wayOverall, its a great price for something my baby will only be using for a short while, and I'm happy with it so far."
2,Popped after about 2 weeks,"This tub deflated/popped after just a couple weeks.. I don't know what happened but you would really be better off buying your baby one of those tub seats that they can actually sit in with the bars (the two that I have are aquababy and safety first). My babies kind of liked this duck tub but they LOVE the tub seats soo much!! I sat them in their seats and they started laughing so hard and really enjoying it because they were actually in the water, it feels like a pool to them.. They can splash around and sit up on their own without falling over. Do not recommend this duck tub. Spend a little more on something that's more efficient, sturdy, and fun for your child."
3,Duck can be scary,"We bought the duck tub because we thought it would be a good transitional tub. Our daughter outgrew her infant tub and is too unstable for the big tub. However, when we tried to put her in the tub, she cried and instantly tried to get out. She appears to be frightened of the big yellow head. We have since tried to have her sit in it while in her room on the carpet - but she wants nothing to do with the duck. The duck tub is now in the garage and we're looking for something else."
5,Great for everyday,"I bought this on a trip and loved it. Its great because it holds the babies' head and is safer than other tubs. The duck's mouth makes noises, its fun an my baby feels free to play and move. I will use it for everyday, not just to travel."
4,Nice tub for a short time,We are very happy with this tub. It worked well for a few months. It was great for transition from infant tub to the big tub. Its nice quality and when you squeeze the duck bill it quacks! Our baby girl loves it! : )
2,"doesn't fit the ""bill""","I looked for a next step solution for a bath for some time. I finally came across this one because of other reviews and I thought it was cute. When it arrived we blew it up no problem. It would have been helpful to know if the dimensions given were for the whole product or the area that the baby sits. Needless to say, this was much smaller than we thought. There were only a couple of inches of room when my baby girl extended her legs and she was 8 months old. She may be in the 90th percentile for height (only 40's for weight), but she is not a giant. There is no way she would be able to use this for very long.On another note, while this is a very cute tub and I had some fun with the quacking, my daughter did NOT like it at all. She was terrified. I think she thought we were trying to feed her to the duck. haha. So, it is being stored under our sink. Perhaps our next little one won't be scared of it."
3,Cute but keeps getting holes,I have purchased 2 of these in the last few months. Both end up with holes in them in no time. I like the tub and it is great for giving new sitters a bath but they don't hold up.
2,Not great for larger babies,"This tub is fine as a second, portable tub, however not so great for larger babies. I have a big baby and when he leans on the side the tub doesn't hold him in. I would consider this if I had a normal or smaller sized baby but it just isn't sturdy enough for us."
3,Waste of space,This tub is small for baby but has a huge waste of space with the big head and tail. I got water all over trying to fill it since it doesn't fit under faucet. I actually can't use it at all since my 13 month old is petrified of it. I had to go back to the hard pink tub but will try another blow-up kind with good reviews and without such a scary duck head!
2,Was great until....,"It spring multiple leaks. I do not know how, but its sooo annoying having to blow it back up after each use. I did love it, and my son is now 2!"
1,used once and last less than one hour,"I bought it when my baby was almost 5 months old. I used this product last week for the first time and my baby loved it, but then it got flat after less than an hour. There was a little whole on the right side of the head. I've tried to fix it but the patch looks like a tape. Totally dissapointed."
2,"Not bad, but leaked","I bought the seal version of this tub for my 8 month old. He was starting to get big for his plastic infant tub, and I didn't feel comfortable putting him in the real bath tub just yet. He wants to stand up and get into everything, so I thought this tub might contain him better. First, it was smaller than I expected and I don't think it would be useful much past 1 year. However, it seemed to do the job - kept him safe inside. The reason for my 2 star review is that the tub had a slow leak from the start - we would inflate it one night and go back to use it the next day and it would be halfway deflated. We were going to try to use the provided repair kit, but we couldn't really find where the leak was coming from (I think it was coming from the area around the piece you use to blow it up, in which case the repair kit wouldn't help anyway). I had to return this product and decided not to try it again for fear the same thing would happen."
5,Great Product,Works great for babies that can sit up on there own. I purchased it for my 6month old and she loves it.
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND duckie tub!,"We just LOVE our duckie tub! I've been using it since my son was 9 months old (because it's VERY hard to use if baby can't sit up by theirselves yet) I think it's so much safer for your baby to be in this cushioned, air tub than to be against the hard bathtub sides. You also only have to fill up a small area for bath time, and you just pull the plug when your done with it. You really don't have to deflate it...ours stays inflated, in the corner of the bathroom all the time. I also think this is a very durable product. My son has drug his duckie all around my house, and it's held up with no holes for over a year now. I actually even bought a couple more for the grandparents houses, to make bathtime safe and fun for them too!out of all the products that I've purchased for my baby since day 1, this it the one that i recommend the most!! I don't know how we would of done bathtime without it!"
5,One of my favorite baby products,"This is the perfect tub to transition a sitting-up baby into the big tub. We used it for both of our children and we all loved it. The tub is soft, slightly supporting and keeps baby happy with water and bubbles, without the need the fill the entire tub. We used it traveling several times too, easily packing it deflated in our suitcase. This would make a great baby shower gift."
2,Too small,Doesn't fit my 4 month old baby.We went to a hotel and it was a nightmare to use it for bathing my baby. Don't but it.
4,"Size a little less, but over all good product.",Size is a bit less than what we expected. But the product is overall good. Its been almost 1 month since I filled it with air and it still retains its shape unlike other similar products
4,perfect until 1 yr,My daughter loved this tub (and the quacking). After 12 months she was ready for a non-slip adult tub though.
5,Love it,"I got this for my daughter when she was to small for the whole tub but to big for the baby tub. I did only use it a few times in the tub and she loved it. As soon as she was able to sit up and able to hold her head up off the floor, I started her in the whole tub. Right now she uses it in her room as a toy holder and something to sit in and play with. When the weather gets warmer, we plan to use it as a small pool that she can play in and splash outside. The beak quacks and still works after almost 9 months of quacks numerous times a day. The suction cup to hang to dry never really worked for me. I ended up turning it upside down to dry. Washing it is very easy. My daughter loves it and I am very pleased with it."
1,product arrived with a hole in it!,"I would love to write a good review about the cute little duck bath tub, but it arrived with a visible hole in it!So i can't comment on the functionality of it when water is placed into it:( so we purchased a different animal bathtub. Oh! the beak quacks though..."
3,ok...but i would buy plastic or another material if I had it to do agaiin,"Not a bad tub for a newborn or infant, but mine popped a leak after 3 months. After 4 months it was unusable."
5,Our daughter loves taking baths in her new duck tub!!,"The duck tub is great for our 7-month-old daughter. She loves the quacking sound that comes from the beak when you press the button. It is great for taking a bath or we sometimes let her play in the duck in the bedroom. Note that we do have a detachable shower head, so it is easier to fill the tub. It might be more difficult if we had to use the bath faucet. Overall, a great purchase for a very reasonable price!"
4,Great tub!,"This has been a great transition tub for my daughter. We started using this tub when she was 6 months old. She outgrew her infant tub, but still seemed too small for the big tub. In the duck tub she was able to sit with more support and reach her toys comfortably without them floating away, like in the big tub. She is 9 months now and still loving it! Great buy for the money!!! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because filling it is a little awkward. I have to use the shower or a bucket/bowl since it is too big to fit under the spout."
2,Didn't last long...,Bought this for a trip-there was a leak at the seal of the head that kept leaking air. Served it's purpose but wouldn't buy again.
2,not as good as i thought,"I was very excited to get this. that faded quick.my son is 9 months and sits very very good on his own. If the duck does not fit very snug in your tub, the sides will bend down with my 25lb baby's weight on it. I will only use this while away from home, to ensure his health from a tub not be clean enough. I will not use it everyday.I LOVE Safety 1st Tub side Bath Seat"
2,For younger babies...,"Might be good for travel, where there isn't access to a tub or used as a small pool, but isn't practical for nightly use, especially if others use the tub. My daughter is almost 5 months, no way would I use this on the counter. The age says 6-24 months. I don't see 12-24 month using this tub. I wish I would have used it sooner to get more use out of it.Also, the duck say HOT when the water is barely warm. Only when the water was cold was the sensor blue. My daughter did laugh at the quacking, so that was worth the $15. I'll likely put a blanket under it on the porch and use it as a little pool this summer."
4,perfect up to 12 months,"I bought this because the box says for up to 24 months - this is misleading. My daughter is 15 months, and this is just too small for her. However, I have it to a friend with a 5 month old, and it is perfect. I would recommend this only up to 12 months. And at this price, you can't go wrong."
4,bathtime fun,I bought this for our grandson to have at our home. He just loves it. My only complaint is that the duck's head should be turned so the child can see it & push the beak.
4,Great tub!,"The last time I bathed my 10 month old son in the kitchen sink, it literally looked like it rained inside the kitchen from his splashing! He loves baths and splashing is sooo much fun for him, but the big bathtub is a little too large for me to feel secure bathing him in without a support aid. I bought this tub, and it works great! He loves the quacking sound when you press the bill. He's 10 mos. old and about 22 lbs, 29"", so this tub may only fit him for another six months or so (it seems he may be too big for it afte that), but the small investment is worth it in the short-term. The only drawback is that you have to inflate it, and unless you can keep in in the tub (or have ample storage room), it would have to be inflated and deflated each time. Fortunately, we have an air compressor and the tub in our guest bath is rarely used by anyone, so it just remains in the tub, inflated, rady for our next use!"
1,GOOD FOR ONE USE,"The wok only worked for one use. It is easily discolored and scratch (using the untiles it comes with) and then it rust.Not worth getting, as a matter of fact, how can I get my money back."
3,"Where are the German, Polish, Russian, Czech films?","Everyone will disagree with some of the authors' choices and omissions. But where are the German films? On any scale, films like M, The Threepenny Opera,Wings of Desire, and Das Boot would rank above at least half of the films included. Where are the Polish films? Several of Wajda's films, for example, would dwarf many of the authors' selections. Where are the Russian films? Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev and Shepitko's The Ascent (to give just two examples) belong near the top of any greatest films list. Have the authors just never seen these films, did they decide only to consider foreign films that have had a large American distribution?"
1,extra ingredients sacrificed to page layout,"If you want a cookbook that is so poorly edited that you will have multiple extra ingredients from the ingredient list that are not used in the recipe, then this is the book for you.Entire paragraphs seem to have been cut out of the recipes for the sake of page layout.What a piece of garbage. I have never been one to burn books, but this is a good candidate for the incinerator."
2,Don't believe the hype,I bought this book because of a rave review in the LA Times. It was intended as a gift but I would be too embarrassed to give it to anyone. Rarely have I seen a worse designed book. It looks like first generation web design blown up and printed between hard covers. The recipes themselves look interesting and the photos are cute but the prentious verbiage and overblown graphics gave me indigestion before I set foot in the kitchen.
1,"A stupid pretentious book, written by a stupid pretentious person, for stupid pretentious people - a complete rip-off.","Aside from the fact that the book was plagiarized by Allan Ben from unknowing photographers & designers who were swindled out of their ideas, designs, compensation, and credit - the book has no soul. There is no ""running thread"" or theme. Not one original thought. Not even worthy as a coffee table book. Don't embarrass yourself - you deserve better."
1,Art maybe. Cook no.,This book has mediocre art value and no cook value. At 9.99 it would be expensive.
4,Great item for the price,I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com and am very happy! The lamp was easy to put together and looks great. I am considering buying a second one!
2,great for a nap!,"I love to hear traders talking shop as much as the next guy, but this trading video has got to be the most boring one ever. Stendahl's delivery is dull and monotone."
5,One of the greatest treats ever!,My dogs absolutely LOVE these treats! They will do almost anything for them and they are made from natural ingredients so I don't mind giving them one when they are good. I highly recommend these treats and I'm sure my 2 dogs would stand behind me on that too.
3,Do you have a choice ?,I agree with quite a few of the comments of other reviewers. The LP Mongolia is rather shoddy and sketchy and could definitely be much better.But is there an alternative ? None of us would have dared to venture outside UB (tourist-speak for Ulaan Baatar) without LP Mongolia. Therein lies its indispensibility !!!
5,Mind Your Communication Gaps Now!,"Naomi Karten's current work focuses on how to ""mind the gap"" between you and your audience. This advice is helpful whether your audience is one person or many, whether communications are in writing or in speech. Her advice goes deeper than the handy techniques she presents. She gives a wider view in analyzing the relationships, the context, and the internal states each of the participants (you the communicator and the listener or reader).Her advice on understanding the other's perspective is a prime example of that depth. While making one's own case is necessary, understanding the other person's perspective is perhaps a more subtle requirement of communications.I found this book not only helpful in my business communications, which the author targets, but also in the range of communications within my own personal life.I recommend this book to all my business colleagues who struggle with the intention of good communciations and the results of poor communications."
1,the worst cdrs ever,The other people who reviewed this must be working for memorex. You have to be smoking massive amounts of tile paste to think that these work. If your looking for five jewel cases with accompyaning drink coasters then i suggest you buy this fine product.
1,Flimsy Product,"This product, while looking pretty and solid, is actually very flimsy. The blades are not terribly sharp, but sufficient to get the job done. The problem is that the small gold-colored screws which hold the device together are not firmly affixed. I noticed one missing after a few days of use, lending the whole device a rather wiggly feel. But after a month's of regular usage under ordinary conditions, half the screws have fallen out and the device is literally falling apart in my hands, with the blades and handles almost entirely detached. As soon as another cutter I just ordered from Amazon arrives, I will toss this one in the thrash."
3,Pulse Meter Good for the money,"For the price, it is a good watch for tracking your pulse. I had some trouble holding my finger steady over the censor for several seconds without shaking. I was pretty accurate on tracking my pulse while not exercising."
1,Minimal application,"Does not get a pulse while running or brisk walking. Just keeps the little bars going across - forever. Tried in deep shade, nope. Tried in medium shade, nope. Tried stopped - sometimes. Only time I could consistently even get a reading is after the run, while I'm in the house cooling down. Not the application I wanted - I wanteda reasonably instantaneous reading while exercising - never got one. I replaced battery (pia!) and got a bit better performance.Wait for better technology."
2,OREGON SCIENTIFIC WATCH/PULSE MONITIER,"VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO GET IT TO MEASURE PULSE RATE-- BUY IT ONLY FOR USE AS A WATCH- WOULD HAVERETURNED IT BUT POSTAGE AND HANDLING CHARGES WERE TOO MUCH"
5,Anime at its finest,"Now I was not always a fan of anime, but I must say that after hearing all the great things about this series and then finally taking the initiative to purchase it and see it for myself I am more than pleased at how great full metal alchemist really is. Get it, and get it in bluray. Not only does it look great but the STORY is excellent, the PLOT is compelling, and the CHARACTERS are vivid and memorable. Action packed and full of excitement, Full Metal Alchemist is a must for anyone wanting to experience the essence of anime."
4,Blu-ray,"One of the best Anime I have seen. Those unsure of buying it, as it is second incarnation of Fullmetal Alchemist series, buy it and you won't be disappointed."
5,LOVE IT,"I could watch FMA over and over again and wont get board from it, its just my all time favorite Anime !"
5,greatness,"love the show working on getting the rest of the season. can't wait just order season two and three can't wait get them, some popcorn and pop makes everything better."
5,Not like the orginal!,"I thought this was going to be a nicer upgraded version of the original, so I was hesitant to get it. Im sure glad I did, I never read the manga but my friends told me it follows that. Soooo good, almost like a different story entirely."
5,I love this series,Finally the pack collection of this amazing anime with bluray's quality. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't have spanish subtitles. What a shame! I'm waiting for low prize in collection two.
3,Can't switch language/subtitles mid stream,"I was very disapointed in the fact that you can't switch the audio track without stoping the movie, going to the main menu and choosing setup and there is no choice on the subtitles at all. From the main menu setup you have two choices, English or Japanese. If you choose the Japanese, you automaticaly get english subtitles and can't turn them off; no subtitles if you choose English."
5,Easy collection of a great series,Funimation is getting great at their Blu-Ray packages and making them a bargain in the process. It has half of the series in a wonderful package. Easy and clean it helped me catch up on months of missed anime in days.
2,Buttermilk Hill,"Okay, I realize that this book is more of a children's book, and therefore probably shouldn't be judged as harshly. I also needed a pretty thin book to read between Lock and Key and starting my October book for my book club at school, and I had about a week to kill. I got this book for free from Read Across America in about the third grade, so that shows you just about how old it is. So rather judging based on complexity and different elements like I normally would, I'm trying to be a bit more lenient. However, based on writing alone, this isn't the greatest of books, even for a kids' book.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
5,A Must Read!,"Things are going very well for 10-year-old Piper Berry, who thinks the whole world is gossamer (that means light and delicate). Then slowly it seems as the book states, ""the gossamer began to unravel."" Piper loves to use words like gossamer, in fact, she has a fascination with words and keeps a notebook of her favorite new words. As things begin to really get bad for Piper, she finds an escape in writing poetry. Words become her way of expressing anger, love, disappointment, and just everyday happenings in the life of a changing pre-teen. Words have such power, Piper learns through the course of the book that words can actually change your life and the lives of those you care about."
4,Good H/E keyboard,"Standard keyboard, works fine, reasonably priced. It is better to buy this keyboard than waste money on a set of Hebrew letter stick-ons that cover the keys of an English-only keyboard. My only criticism of this keyboard is that the English letters are in bolder face than the Hebrew letters. Since I can touch type in English, my native language, I do not really need to see the English characters that often. I would have prefered to have bolder Hebrew characters, because I still have to hunt and peck in Hebrew, my new language. Nevertheless, the Hebrew letters are easily seen."
3,Packing very poor,"The book was a good choice. However, it arrived with a dented corner and the jacket cover torn away and missing in that corner. The few sheets of crumpled newspaper used was not sufficient padding.I would think more care should have been given the merchandise considering the amount of shipping/handling more than covered the postage.So much for giving a ""new"" book as a Christmas gift."
4,Best Of The Bunch,"Out of all the Radko books, this one is clearly the best of the bunch. Great historical pictures and modern production pics that are very interesting. As usual, the ornament photos are flawless, and the ornaments being chronologically make this book a great reference piece / check list. If I have to pick a nit, the only thing that mars the book is the usual Radko propaganda. At least in this book it's kept to a minimum and there's more text about the glass blowers and the production process. If you have to have a Radko book, This is the one!"
1,Awful,"I am so glad that I could take this back for an exchange. It was slow, heavy and very messy. I could not get the extra paint out of the hose, cleaning the hose had paint everywhere and then it started pumping and would not stop. Get something else!!"
1,Complete Disappointment,"Complete worthless waste of time and money. I would not recommend this to my worst enemy. I can only suspect that the peeps that wrote the good reviews actually work for wagner. I wasted 2 hours without any results at all. It is late and the store is closed and I'm on a tight deadline. Do not depend on this product to get the job done timely. Wagner should be reported to the BBB for false advertising.Just another example of a company sacrificing quality for quantity on cheap labor in China. I hope their CEO made his/her millions this year on outsourcing, at all their 'soon-to-be' ex-customers expense!!!"
1,Completely Worthless,"Not only did I waste my money, I also wasted a day's worth of painting. After almost an hour, the paint has yet to reach the roller. I have checked and rechecked all of the fittings and hose connections, and am using brand-new alkaline batteries. It is painfully obvious that the rate of flow, while inevitably destinied to saturate the roller at some point in the future, will never come close to being sufficient to keep the roller wet.At first I simply thught that my unit was defective, but after reading the reviews here, it would seem that the utter uselesness of this product is due to either a design flaw or the worse quality control since Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle.""This product deserves zero stars, if only Amazon would allow it."
1,I would recommend this to an enemy.,"First of all, I only bought this one because of the price, my first mistake. It took a good 30 minutes or more for the paint to reach the roller and another 30 minutes or so for the roller to get enough paint on it to work. It never worked like a normal roller, it took me at least 3 times longer to paint with this than with a regular roller and I am not a pro. It also made a terrible squeaky noise every time the roller went down and up. Also, when I opened my box it didnt have the extention in there as the box said. It obviously was a return before I got it. Needless to say, I am having my husband box it up now and return it and we will try another more expensive one. I guess you get what you pay for. However, I will get my 4 ""C"" batteries out of it before taking it back!"
5,Loved It!!!!,I got this product & absolutely loved it. It took me no time to finish my upstairs painting. I wish I would had known about it sooner...I would be fiished painting.
5,One of the best UFC PPV's ever. UFC 84,"This is one of the best UFC PPV ever. ALmost all the fights made it on the PPV. They are all exciting. Even the Tito fight, which was a bit slow, was still a great show. Sherk and BJ, wow.And Wanderlei Silva. We now know why he is called the Axe Murderer in America again.Read the other guys reviews, they know what's up. I can just say that this event is permantly etched in HD on my DVR. When it evaporates, I will be getting this DVD."
4,Great Buy!!,These earrings are a great buy for the money. I bought them as bridesmaids gifts for my wedding and couldn't be more pleased!
5,Beautiful Illustrations,Loved this book! Simple but beautiful illustrations depicting the Navy life. A cherished keepsake to have in a Sailor's treasures and to pass down thru generations.
5,A Wonderful Deck with Tons of Information,"This a great deck. I find it to be great in understanding the motivations behind a situation and to also help out with career questions whether an issue in your current field or when you're trying to find your path in another field and you're not quite sure what that is yet.The downside of the deck are the images, those who are used to contemporary decks with pictoral images may have difficulty with this deck. If you're absolutely new to Tarot and haven't bought a deck, I think this deck would be fine and help strengthen your ability to read other contemporary decks better because the book that comes with this deck is quite indepth with meanings and symbols.I've been doing a lot of work related reads with this deck for others and its been spot on in knowing and showing where their skills lie and what they can do to be better at their job."
1,Didn't Fit My Truck...,"The assorted control knobs did not fit my 89 Ford F250 as there site said, if you have this year find another source. They also need a better package of Knobs, the quality of these items is very cheap."
4,Refreshing Humor,Anyone who enjoys Rick and Bubba on the air will surely enjoy reading this book. It consists of short mostly humorous stories of their family life and gives a view of the personal background of each. The reader sees their failures as well as their successes and I was impressed again by their devotion to Christianity. I found the book to be very easy to read and quite interesting. A part of the book is recorded on the CD included with the book. Other stories are also on the CD.
5,Fellow fatboys do good!,This book is great! Two fellow fatboys telling the truith. The only thing better than reading this book is reading it while eating pie!
5,excellent read!,"I love have been a fan of the Rick and Bubba show for over five years and I love their sence of humor, love for God, and family their book is all about how they view life and I just love it!I have been recomending it to all my friends, and family because it is the best book in my mind that you can buy!I give it five stars! way to go Rick and Bubba!"
5,Rick and Bubba's expert guide,"Loved it! Very funny, but of course not as good as listening to them on the radio live. Funny life stories we can all relate to but given in a hilarious format."
5,Great Book for Everyone,"I have been a fan of The Rick and Bubba Show for 12 years. These guys are the real thing and that is what makes the book so great. They find humor in everyday things and tell hilarious stories about kids, food, church, etc. They are truly a blessing to their listeners and anyone would enjoy this book."
5,Of Course Rick&Bubba's Humor Comes Through on Paper..Stay.In.It,"I have known Rick & Bubba since the days when no one listened to them. As they grew and the Army grew The Guys kept learning and getting it right more than the other. Once they got the TV show it wasn't long until someone came up with this book. What the guys were afraid of was that their humor wouldn't come out in a Book. Well guys, it is just like watching the show or listening to a CD or hearing the radio show. I hope all non Army people will pick this book up just to learn what this Rick & Bubba stuff is all about. The Guys are funny, Good clean humor and ALL SOUTHERN.Great Job on writing the book to all at W. STAY IN IT!"
2,Too theoretical,"I bought the book hoping to get a bunch of solved concrete exercises, like ""Calculate these integrals"", ""find a conformal mapping between these regions"", etc. There are a lot of solved exercises, but those are of the kind ""Prove Causchy's Thm"", ""Prove Causchs Integral Formula"", ""Prove Liouville's Thm"", ""Prove Rouches Thm"", etc. I can use any book on complex analysis for learning the proofs of the theorems. This book will not help you if you, as (e.g.) an engineerer, want to practice your skill calculating integrals and stuff. If all you want are theorems and proofs, this book is quite cheap and quite ok."
4,Great reference book for complex Variables,I purchased this complex Variables Schuam's Guide in conjuction with my complex Variables class it is very good short - refernece guide to complex variables.I used it every now and then whenever their was a subject I didn't understand in class.I am giving it 4 stars because not all subjects covered in class were listed in the book so i used the class textbook (Complex Variables) to help me there or visiting the professor in his office hours.
1,too theoretical,"I bought this thinking it would help me understand complex variables, complex integration and differentiation. As another customer commented there are wayyyy to few solved concrete problems, all of the solved problems are proving some theorem. This is useless. I can look those proofs up elsewhere. What I expected was concrete solved problems, there are very very few of those. All in all I am rather dissapointed with this book. Not recommended unless you are looking for many proofs of just theorems."
1,1000?,"Why does it cost $1000. Its nitro fuel for toy cars, its not rocket fuel. I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, confused..."
4,Double Lives: Double Cross,"Stephen Koch makes clear through the device of tracing some of the life of Willi Munzenberg that Stalin and Hitler were in cahoots through most of the 30s. Hitler's Anti-Bolshevism and Stalin's Anti-Fascism were merely window dressing to fool the democratic opponents to one or the other regime. Stalin's Soviet Union aided the Wehrmacht during the time when the Treaty of Versailles limited the size and capability of the German Army. Koch makes it clear that Stalin's duplicitousness continued right up until Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. The cluelessness of many, if not most, Western intellectuals during this period is breathtaking from the vantage point of the post-Cold War world. What is more disturbing is the post-fact absolution of Stalin from complicity in Hitler's rise and his conquest of Western Europe. Anyone interested in the true history of post-WWI Europe should read this book."
5,a must for all lovers of bach cantatas,"this clear account of the early cantatas is a must for all lovers of Bach and his choral music. Written by acknowledged authorities in the field, this book complements Koopmans on going CD cycle of the cantatas but can be used with great benefit with other cycles as well. If you love the cantatas this is a must have book"
5,Highly listenable over and over,This is one of my favorite CD's. I can set this CD to auto-repeat and let it go for hours before I feel the need to change it. Great acoustic guitar music and interesting vocals.
5,"A Book Thats Gonna Make You ""Run""Away With It","I rated this book wrong, it deserves ten stars! It was better than the 1st book! There is tons of action and unexpected twists in this story. Its ""on the edge of your seat action"" as movie critics call it. Which makes an a-w-esome book!!!!!!!!"
2,Boring,"This is a very short criticism.Nothing in the book is interesting. By the end I already knew what was going to happen.I know I am not alone with this review because my whole class read it, and even the teacher coudn't wait to get rid of it.Don't get me wrong though; the first book was decent."
1,this is NOT the same Aimee Allen,There should be a disclaimer or at the very least a photo so buyers know this is not the first Aimee Allen who sang revolution.
4,A WARM PROVOCATIVE MEN'S FRAGRANCE,"Every once in a great while a fragrance is found that seems to exemplify the person for whom it is named. Such is the case with ""Spirit Antonio Banderas.""Very much like the roles played by the actor this is an energetic, vital scent topped by notes of Citrus Leaves and Bergamot, underscored by Orange Tree Leaves, Florals and Cinnamon bark. Sound Latin? It is also reminiscent of that country and culture - a bit provocative, warm, very appealing.Banderas has said, My Spanish heritage is very important to me, and in everything that I do I want to be an ambassador for Latin culture. Spirit is an invigorating, masculine fragrance that reflects a part of my personality......""It does, indeed.Spirit is available in a 1 oz. and 1.7 oz spray, as well as in an After Shave Balm and Shower Gel."
2,fake cologne,"I had this product for awhile and had tested it with the same product form the store. Now, I can say with high degree of certainty that the product I got from Amazon online must has watered down with some other ingredient. Because, the smell from the store is more concentrated and last a whole lot longer. I dont think I will buy anymore colonge online."
1,Not the same as previous product!,"I agree with ""pchan"".In his review he mentions that this is not the same as previously purchased from a local department store.I have worn Spirit for the last 5 years and I have to say that what pchan stated about this product is true.This is my first product review on Amazon. Because of how helpful pchans review has been I will be certian to add my comments and reviews to more products I purchase at Amazom, be it positive or negitive.I can only hope this helps others to be more knowlagable about this product.TimBo"
3,Pay attention to the picture!,"I didn't realize from the description and the book specs. that this was a coloring book, or I wouldn't have purchased it. It's not a bad coloring book, I just thought it was a story."
3,An interesting little book,"This book is truly light and small in size. If you are looking for heavy duty French literature book, this is not it."
3,Master Replica,It May look real Put its not. One of my Friends Dads work at Lucas and owns a prototype arts told me that you can trick your Friends with this Baby.
4,A must-read for those considering a communal life,"In this day and age it is difficult to believe that there are still controlling organizations such as the Bruderhof who use religion and faith to mislead people into joining their ranks. I would highly recommend reading this book if you are fed up with today's society and thinking of joining the Bruderhof or another similar group. The people leading these groups are the opposite of everything they claim to be, to put it simply they are hypocrites. You will never get the true story of what it is like living in a commune until you read this book. I highly recommend it, it is a very moving and emotional story."
2,Pleil contributes unique perspective of former insider,"Evidently forbidden reading for Bruderhof associates, this book gives yet another angle on life in a ""christian commune"". For readers already intrigued with this peculiar social experiment Pleil's book is a must-read particularly because it seems to have touched a nerve with bruderhof leadership as will no doubt be reflected in other reviews appearing here."
1,A boring acount based on Memories only and not facts,One can see from the Sales Rank that this book is not worth the paper it is printed on. Speaking to others who have experienced the same time as Nadine writes about once gets a completely different story. I feel sorry for every reader who purchased this book. There are better books available on the Bruderhof
1,Electrical tape would probably be better,There is no way you could use this product as a trunk seal. Don't waste your money. It won't work for any of the classic or current Mopars.
5,Nusrat - intoxicated spirit,"Fantastic CD. Any fan of Nusrat Fateh ALi Khan should defintely try to have this CD as part of his album. you'll enjoy each and every track, over and over again. My favourite is the extra long Yeh Jo Halka Halka."
5,"Oh, the enchantment of poweful verses","Again, a beautiful selection with very nice verses. 1. Yeh Jo Halka Halka Wonderful music and verses 4. Meri Saqi Saqi Ye Nice one"
1,Really Bad,"And I thought ""the raft"" was bad.I bought this at a used book store and could not read it anymore after the first 10 pages (or less?)No mental picturesNo character devFlat iconsBlack holes way under utilizedComputers are the ""magic box"" ... quaintI'd like to rewrite it...break it up a bit and make it edible.Horrible fiction."
2,You Get What You Paid For,"This product works, but is cheaply made. The circuit bourd in the car adapter snapped in half when the wire plugged into usb was bumped."
5,Medium - Seasons 1-5,"My Mama and I watch the show halfway across the country from each other, then get on the phone and discuss them. For one reason and another, we've each missed more than a few of the episodes. I bought us each a set of the DVDs, so now we can watch and discuss them any time.Fun!"
4,Cold War Stories,Not much-but explicitly documented actions spy agencies use to get info round a globe.Interesting doco.
1,Looked cute but ended up being a disappointment,"This item was a gift for my third child, and I initially thought it would be a fun and unique activity for her. It turned out to be disappointing. First of all, the plastic smell was overpowering for the longest time. Second, whenever I put her near this toy, she lost interest in the fish (which are inside the ""body"" of the turtle) and seemed more interested in trying to grab the turtle's head. Finally, the inside became very moldy even after I emptied it and attempted to rinse it out. This toy looked like a good idea but ended up being useless. Find something better to entertain your baby!"
3,Finally some tummy time....,"My daughter HATED tummy time, this was the only thing that would make her stay on her tummy for any length of time. She did get bored with it easily though and we probably only used it for a total of 2 months. Make sure to empty it out all the time too and refil it or it'll start growing mold. Oh and the one here is about double the price of the same exact one I found at a different store (starts with a W)"
2,Big Load of Boredom,"My mother bought this for my baby when he was 4 months old b/c he loved water and playing on his tummy. Well the babies cannot do anything with this toy, the toys do not move around unless you hit the mat really hard or tip it over yourself. The peices get stuck in the corners where babies dont even notice them. You cannot even hear the swishy sounds because of that. The only thing my baby likes is pulling the turtles head down and trying to suck on it. He wouldnt even look at this toy after the 2nd day and I dont blame him."
1,Munchkin Play N Pat Mat,"I don't recommend this toy. It's a hassle to fill it with water and air every time you use it. I left water in it for a day or two and now the inside is moldy and there's no way to clean it. The floating toys inside are usually stuck together. And, my one year old son has only liked playing with it once."
1,"Cute, but pretty useless.","We bought this for our daughter when I was pregnant, based on the cuteness factor. It is a very cute toy, but my daughter was never very interested in it. When we first took it out of the box, the toys inside that were supposed to float were stuck to the plastic. I went ahead and put water in it, hoping that it would ""unstick"" them, but I had to unstick them manually, and even then, they barely floated. I think we used this three times, and other than that, it's just been taking up space. I wouldn't buy it again."
3,play and pat water mat.....,"I ordered this for my 6 month old son, and first of all I want to say that he loves it! The only thing thas was wrong with it is that is must have gotten too hot during shipping and the toys inside were stuck on the plastic, and i had to peal them off. When I did that some of the paint came off and was still on the plastic, but all you have to do to get it off is rub on it a little bit, then it comes right off. But in all my son really does like it, and it seemes to be tough enough even for him! I would sugest this for people, but i would sugest that you get it before 6 months, i do not think he will have a lot of time to play on it...i wish i would have gotten sooner!"
4,Great toy for tummy time!,"I purchased this water mat for my daughter to encourage more tummy time, and guess what it worked! She loves the colors and loves trying to catch the fish inside the water. So far, it has proven durable. Also, my daughter's physical therapist recommends this product. We are happy with this product."
3,Didn't hold up well.,"When I bought this yellow duck mat (not a turtle) my son was 6 months old and I was watching a 3 month old baby as well. They loved this product and were very intrigued at first. About the third time I let them play with this, the wing became seperated from the body. I tried using the included patch to close up the little hole, but because of the wierd angle, it never held air again. It was great while it lasted, just wish it would've lasted longer."
3,"Cute, but not much fun","I bought this toy because I figured it would be something that would be a good tummy time toy when my son was still to young to sit up....he didn't have much interest in it and still doesn't. The main problem I had with it was that when I inflated it as instructed, the pieces that were supposed to float stuck to the surface and hardly moved when pushed on. It is a very cute idea for a toy, and may have caught his interest more if the pieces had been more free moving."
3,Looks are deceiving!,"I bought this toy for my five month old daughter thinking that it would incourage her to be on her tummy more. Needless to say she will only tolerate it for a few minutes and then fusses. All the little floater toys get stuck in the corners, and let's face it babies at this age don't have enough oomph to make the water swish around themselves. I found myself having to do it for her every two minutes or so just to keep her interested. Also, the actual water play area is not very big at all. Unless you have a baby on the smaller side, I recomend that you shop around for a water mat other than this one. Some of your bargin stores such as Wal-mart and Target offer more of a selection for a better product for less than you will pay for this one. All in all this toy is okay if you just cannot find any other water filled mats."
4,Makes Tummy Time longer,"My 4 month old son is still not the biggest fan of tummy time, but this does seem to keep him there longer. I haven't had any problems with it leaking, and I like the frogs that stand up, it gives him a reason to lift up his head and look at them."
2,Cute and fun toy but poorly made,"First off....DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS TOY IF YOU HAVE CATS!!!!!I bought this for my 7 month old daughter and she really liked it. It helped her to sit by herself for longer periods of time which was great. It also really entertained her, she likes aquatic themed toys.However, mine had several holes in the water part which leaked everywhere during the night. I had a tidal pool in my living room!The downside to this toy is your supposed to empty the water out after every use. I must be super strong because after placing the valve on the first time neither I, my mother or my husband could remove it!! We had to take it back the next day.Its an inexpensive toy and as long as yours works then I would go for it. But if its broken you'll have more water on your floor then in the toy."
2,Not Impressed,My daughter never played with this... ever. Although my ferrets were fasinated by it!!
2,Frustrated!,"I bought this for my daughter at 4 months. She is pretty good on her tummy and enjoys almost any toy. She was sooo frustrated with this. She didn't understand why, even when her aim was perfect, she couldn't ""catch"" the toys inside."
2,"Looks good, but QC is bad","My wife spent half an hour trying to fill this with water before giving it to me. I determined that they forgot to punch a hole in the hard plastic insert where you're supposed to put the water. When I tried, I ended up punching a hole in the other side. Will be taking it back."
2,a positivistic slant,"This text is a text: it looks and reads like one, which limits its audience. It also struck me as partial, with a positivistic slant, and, even though originally published in 1976, oddly outdated. The index has no listing under Vygotsky, a major oversight, I would think in a text on learning, since today's journals, at least in the area of literacy, repeatedly refer to his ideas and influence."
2,QUITE LONG-WINDED AND BORING---,"""He rolled over, muttering wild words beneath his breath as he pulled her on top of him and bucked upward, again and again and again. Then, still not satisfied, he rolled over again and sat up, lifting her legs to curve around his hips. 'You're not taking enough.' His flesh was pulled tight over his high cheekbones, his lips heavy with sensuality as his hips jerked feverishly back and forth.""I have found most of Iris Johansen's books I've read hold a pattern for me. The first couple of pages stir my imagination, the main body of the book is boring and choppy with flat characters and eye-rolling sex scenes, then at the very end some action takes place to spark the interest--but too little too late. I think it's time I pass on this author."
1,GOLDEN BARBARIAN,"ONCE AGAIN THE HERO DOES NOT FALL IN LOVE UNTIL THE END, WHILE THE HEROINE (SO INLOVE HERSELF) ENDEAVORS TO HAVE THE HERO LOVE HER FOR MOST OF THE STORY. I JUST DONT LIKE THESE TYPES OF STORIES. HE CAN BE ARROGANT,""BARBARIAN"", POSSESSIVE EVEN RUTHLESS, BUT I WANT HIM IN LOVE WITH THE HEROINE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.YOU CAN GENERATE A LOT OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND CONFLICTS AND STILL HAVE THE HERO IN LOVE WITH THE HEROINE."
4,Captivated my cats,"Both of my cats were immediately captivated by this DVD and were engaged the entire two hours. The second hour ""special edition"" included clips with squirrels and chipmunks that seemed to get them especially excited. I was surprised that the next morning one of my cats went to the TV and started looking around, it seemed to me that she wanted to watch again so I put it on and she happily sat in front of the TV talking and touching the screen. Her brother was attracted by the sounds and came in to join her.Because it is a DVD it can be set up to run as a continuous program if you want to leave it running when not home. Lucy gave it 4 stars only because she wanted more squirrels and chipmunks and found the aquarium scenes boring."
4,An action movie for cats,"If your cats sit in windowsills and make ungodly noises as birds fly by ... if they spring into action whenever a squirrel comes within a 100-yard radius ... if they've been stung more than once playing ""catch the wasp"" ... you NEED this DVD.I will say that I cannot leave my cats unsupervised while it's on, since they bat at, jump on and generally attempt to climb through the TV while they watch, but this is prime entertainment for both the cat and the cat-watching public.The production values are admittedly poor (I have a big screen plasma TV and the first feature in particular is exceedingly grainy). However, the cats don't seem to care, so I can't mark it down too much for that. I just hope they come out with a high-def version soon."
4,Great Entertainment for Cats,"Although I found this DVD to be a little over priced, I must say our cats enjoy it. (2) of our previously indoor/outdoor cats are now indoor only cats, and this has helped to amuse them, and to ease their initial frustration of no longer being allowed to go outdoors.The birds and squirrels are in your face, especially since we play it on a big screen TV. The bird sounds are great as well, so that even when the cats are in another room, the birds chirps drawn them to the other room.Recommended."
1,Too much profanity for my taste.,"While I thought that the author had a very good writing style, I was very distracted with the excessive profanity. I also could not relate to the extensive discussion of music and movies that were mentioned numerous times. I am a breast cancer survivor and can certainly identify with the anger that the author felt....however, I have not ever felt the need to use the ""f"" word even once throughout the eleven months of treatment that I had to endure. This author uses it on almost every page. I would have found the book much more enjoyable if the language were toned down considerably."
1,Missing the Mark,"Following upon the review by Terry Banker, I judged his observations to be 'spot on.' Have been in health care for over 30 years and quite frankly, thought the book missed the mark in terms of having a basic sympathetic respect for women. I am a male working in an environment where the majority of my co-workers were women. The author's lack of sensitivity would have had me off the job in no time. Obviously, Rosie O'Donnell--whose name appears on the jacket cover--did not take the time to read the book only had her publicist answer on her behalf...and so it goes."
5,It Takes a Brilliant Writer,"This is an extraordinary document from a first-time author. Written in a free-form, short-chapter ""Nick Hornby"" style, Halpin has crafted an astonishingly simple, honest, grotesque and delirious book. Part Kafka, part Stephen King, Halpin's document reads like Banana Yoshimoto's ""Kitchen:"" pure, fast, emotional, edgy, electric. Quite a debut for Mr. Halpin, who has quickly -- and probably inadvertently -- achieved greatness with It Takes a Worried Man."
3,Somewhat Out-Of-Date,The reviews are a few years out of date and some of the restaurants no longer exist. Much of the space dedicated to expensive restaurants where I was looking for more reasonably-priced places.
2,Missing Min/Max Reset Capability,"Sure, it measures temperature accurately, as well as recording min and max values since reset. The problem is, there isn't a way to reset the min/max values without, as the manual says: ""simply remove the batteries"".Huh? It has buttons...use them...the previous Taylor I had (in the same price range) reset via button."
5,We've loved it.,We got this thermometer last May. It has been really useful for us to be able to compare indoor and outdoor temperatures easily. It has a nice big display that even the kids can read. We like it so much we've considered getting another one for the sunny side of the house.
4,Taylor Model 1456,"Pleased with the performance of the unit. Most manufacturers ask you to read the entire instructions prior to use. Took about 4 or 5 minutes, and about 4 minutes to set up and put in service. The screws on the battery covers are not too small. Typical of this genre of instruments. Only feature missing is a backlit readout face. Mounting hardware was included. Using Nickel-Metal Hydride AA batteries. For the price of this item, and its functions, I recommended it. Thanks, Mr. Marks"
5,Great adquisition,"Hi, this is a gret thermometer. It has a very long cable for outdoor temp. It is quite simple to use and understand. It could change the display to Celcius degrees."
4,short version of rockollection,"This item has UPC 8 28765 53362 1. I was dissapointed to find that the song, Rockollection, was truncated on this album, only 4'08 of the original 11'43 song. After some research I found that there was a version of this product with UPC 8 28765 60152 8, that has a sleeve that includes the 2 CD album above, plus a CD single of the original Rockollection (version longue remasterizee) in its own sleeve (which has the picture from the original record album).So if you've never heard this music before, no problem. If you're trying to relive memories from the days of vinyl records, then you may be happier if you track down the version with the bonus CD."
2,Not very good,"I really wanted to like this, as I've been a Blasters fan since American Music, X fan, Dave Alvin fan.... but these are terrible. Not taut, not *poems*. Could use several revisions to shape them into poems. These are rough drafts, loose, unformed, uncrafted potential."
5,"Joyous, heartbreaking writing","Poe Ballantine's writing breaks my heart. You'll catch yourself laughing at the little personal tragedies of his unique and vivid characters, and then sighing when you understand that life's never gonna be easy. In the end you may want to cry, feeling like you've lost your best friends. At least I did.I can heartily recommend this book with no reservations. It's my opinion that Ballantine is one of the best writers of his generation: his prose style seems so simple and easy, which lets the reader get intimate with his characters. But at the same time the writing is very polished. It's chock full of keen observations from a writer's eye.Go out and buy this one and then find an empty afternoon during which you can cozy up with a cup of tea and a blanket."
4,"Great Writing, But Not Inspiring","I am a big Poe Ballentine fan. His nonfiction is not always inspiring, but that's the way life goes sometimes, especially in Bellentine's self-imposed exile life style in his formative early years. In fiction, a writer can choose to inject a bit of optimism, which Ballentine chooses not to do in his plot. His writing is as clever, edgy and funny as always - which alone is worth the price of admission. Great supporting characters - especially the jilted lover and his best friend. But the self-destructive bent they all have does not result in any helpful insight or results. I was a little disappointed in this fact, but not surprised. I predict the movie script - if it is ever produced- will engineer at least a hopeful ending."
3,Short Fiction Still Best,"Poe Ballentine is one of my favorite authors of nonfiction or short stories, but I he fell short of my perhaps elevated expections with this first novel. The characters and situations are intriquing, however, and I would recommend this as a good read for those familiar with Ballentine's work or anyone interested in an off-beat description of life on the fringe."
3,Expecting Prime Rib,"While reading ""Feasting the Heart"" I went back for seconds just to check and make sure I hadn't missed something on the menu. My reading didn't satiate my hungry curiosity about the popularity of Reynolds Price. Admittedly, my expectations were high, perhaps akin to anticipating prime rib at a fancy restaurant and not appreciating the lobster bisque Dad whipped up at home.Certainly, there were great chunks of tasty musings among the essays, some evidencing their seasoned nature. It was a pleasant aftertaste that arrived to surprise me, rather than a bold first bite. However, there were times when I felt as if I'd eaten down to the bottom of the bowl and came up empty.Pushing through the book I kept thinking to myself, ""just one more bite and then I'm finished."" Yet, the next title would catch my eye and I'd start the indulgence once again. It could be that Price is an acquired taste - one that I'll try again just to be sure."
3,Too Thin,"Reynolds Price is my favorite writer, and while there is nothing wrong with ""Feasting the Heart"" as far as it goes, it doesn't go far enough. Each essay is interesting, some are very satisfying, but I don't believe the collection is worth a book. A much weightier offering would have coupled these commentaries with the other reviews and essays written by Price since the publication of ""A Common Room"" in 1987. ""Feasting the Heart"" is too thin. I much prefer ""A Perfect Friend,"" his first book for children, also recently published. I look forward to Price's next novel, memoir, or play. I know it won't be too thin."
2,5 mediocre matches,"This DVD is only 50 minutes long and has only 5 matches.Matches are: 1 Cactus Jack & Sheik Braddock vs Jeff Jarrett & Matt Brome2 Lightning Kid vs Dapper Dan3 Dustin Rhodes vs Gary Young Bull Rope Match4 Million Dollar Baby vs Mario Santana Midget Match5 Jerry the King Lawler vs Junk Yard DogAll matches are quite old and are from the USWA & GWF. None of the matches are that good. The sound is really bad. The crowd noise is loud and the comintary is turned down so low its really hard to hear. The opening tag match is stange in that half way through it cuts to a pre match promo cut by Jarrett & Brome, then goes right back to the match. DVD Bonus features are direct match acess, an extremly lame triva quiz and a slide show. Overall its a very Boring DVD."
5,Perfect for the child who likes to be a Princess,These wall self stick princesses are so easy to use that my 4 year old had fun helping decorate her room. They are easy to remove and restick somewhere else so my daughter could have her favorites moved to different spots in her room as her interests changed. There are even some pretty flowers that look great on our bathroom wall too. I loved that they came on separate sheets and we didnt have to use them all at one time. The are easy to take down and store back on sheet. Ours even came with some pretty jewels that can be stuck on the wall to add some sparkle.
5,"The Single Greatest Plush Flopsie on the Market, for the Man Who Accepts Nothing Less","The e-mail I received from Amazon.com about my recent purchase asked: ""Michael Davis, did 'Plush Otto Sea Otter Mini Flopsie 8-inch' meet your expectations?""That may be THE stupidest question I've ever read. Because God in Heaven, DID IT EVER.Because what I expected was the finest goddamn mini flopsie produced, and that's exactly what I got. If you demand the finest example of a product in the market, and can't settle for anything but, you can click ""Add to Cart"" with confidence, friend. This is the last eight-inch plush otter flopsie you'll ever need."
4,Gift for my girlfriend,"My girlfriend really likes otters. So I bought her one of these and had it shipped to her house. She loved it. It makes a great gift for both girlfriends and small children. Soft and cute, it is an adorable little otter. P.S. We named it Oscar"
5,love it,I got the cd looking for the one song from inuyasha but i love all the song. play them all the time
1,didnt recieve the item,"i ordered for the item 2nd July, and also paid for it. then i waited 25 days till 27th July. still i didn't receive it. i contacted the seller, and he told me that he didn't even know i bought this item from him. it was totally absurd. then i asked for refund. and he refunded me less then the money i paid. i had to contact him again for a full refund. it was a total headache for me. be careful guys."
4,"book is great, took a week & a half to arrive","the book is in great condition. But it took a week and a half to arrive. While this is still within the allotted time-frame, I've found other places ship more promptly."
1,Don't buy Edited/Censored DVDs,I am getting tired of this and positively will NOT buy Edited/Censored DVDs! Not even a little tiny little edit is ok. Another great DVD collection ruined by the suits.
4,The Cream of South African Mbaqanga music,"Mahlathini (the male lead) and the three women who compose the Mahotella Queens are a classic act in the bouncy, Soweto jive style known as 'mbaqanga', having performed together since the 1960s.This particular album highlights their main hits, and is a kick-ass example of authentic black South African pop. I work as a volunteer air-shifter on a world beat program on our local community radio station and out of all of the 5 or so CDs we have of M. and the M. Queens, I love this the best!"
2,why bother?,"I bought this book to research how to implement a new site on Mambo CMS. It basically was a copy of basic explanations that are on the mambo site, and only addressed the structure that is in place with default values on the test page. Why bother spending the money when all of the info is online? And why call it a tutorial, when it doesn't show you how to do anything, but rather just explains what each thing is supposed to do?Also, and this is my fault for not thinking about it when I was buying, but 227 pages of computer book is not worth $40. Even if it were really good, which it's not."
5,Versitile,"These pedals are great. They take a few hours, even days, to get used to and adjust, but once you get used to the change, they are amazing. I won't ever switch back. Fast shipping as usual from UPS, they are the best. No complaints. All I have to point out is the adjustment bar next to the beaters are not present on this model. Not that it would have changed anything much, but I wanted to notify anyone thinking of purchasing these fine instruments of music. Great handmade product."
5,Absolutely Stunning,"This necklace is everything and more that's in the description and i feel that this piece of jewelry came from the finest jeweler in the world. For the people who dont need spend thousands of dollars on amazingly beautiful gifts to express how you feel this is the best there is. The color is a cool, relaxed 'feel good' color which matches so perfectly with the emotions i had (i got this for my Girlfriend) and the feelings you have for your special someone or ever to spoil yourself. It is an only 18'' necklace so if you're of bigger stature you're definitely going to need a bigger chain but other than that this piece is incredible 5/5."
5,What a Deal!,"This necklace is even more gorgeous than I had dared to hope! The chain is sturdy and shiny, and the Topaz is a beautiful sparkling-clear blue. I have only had it for a week, and I have already received numerous compliments. This is a lovely necklace and the price makes it that much sweeter!"
3,Blue topaz silver pendant,"liked it, but was the chain silver? A deeper blue would have been preeferable Title Blue topaz pendant.. I do like jewellery"
5,Beautiful!,"I wear this piece everyday! It is a lighter stone, but it sparkles in the light and is worth the price. The chain is cheap, but if fits nicley on another chain. I would buy this again!"
4,A little small but very shiny,"The Topaz is a little tinier than I imagined, but the color is exactly how it is pictured and it's super shiny. The chain is very shiny as well. Overall very satisfied."
2,It was OK,This item was not as good looking in person as it looked in the picture. We were a little disappointed.
3,"Ok,","Item was as described, great for a young girl,middle school age. Mount was acceptable. ok price for the size and quality of the stone"
4,Awesome Necklace!,"My girlfriend loved this necklace! It's so inexpensive, but still looks great! This is a great present for the month of December"
2,Support you local jeweler,"It looked so nice in the photo but what I have is a tiny chip of (probably artificial) blue topaz on a chain about the thickness of heavy sewing machine cotton. Perhaps a pretty thing for a little girl but certainly not adult jewelry. Looks and feels like a con as the jewelers in my local shopping mall all offer far better pieces for a lower price.Sterling Silver Blue Topaz Pendant, 18"""
5,Great Value - Nice and Sparkly!,"Received this pendant yesterday and am so pleased! I ordered it for Easter - it's a large impact for a low price, but it really is so gorgeous that I'm sure I'll be wearing it all summer. The silver really sets the whole thing off. The stone itself has beautiful color, as other reviewers have said, and appears to be of really good quality and is very eye catching. The chain is a bit delicate (I've got 5 children who can be rambunctious and might snap the chain), but at this price, I wasn't expecting a big, heavy chain. I'll wear it consciously, meaning that I don't think I'll have to be careful with it - just thoughtful of wearing it. Very worthwhile purchase and I know I'll get plenty of enjoyment out of it. Bonus was that it arrived in it's own drawstring storage pouch too. Very happy with my purchase."
1,Aggravated.,"I ordered this for my best friend two weeks before Christmas, it said it would be here the 10th of this month. It never showed up. I give the company ZERO stars."
3,Above average,"The item came in on time and was well packaged. Got a box and a blue velvet pouch along with the pendant. Though the stone is a lot lighter than its advertised image it looks good. One issue is that the stone had a relatively long scratch mark/streak on it. It is visible when you look at the stone against a light source, but I guess at this price Quality is not really paramount!"
3,Pretty but not Wonderful,"The necklace is pretty, but looking at the other reviews I was expecting to be wowed. I wasn't. I kept the necklace, but if I had seen this at a store I would not have bought it. The stone was almost see through and the chain was shiny in a cheap sort of way. I'm hoping after I have it for a while the shine will fade."
4,Enlightening,"I guess I need to thank the folks at Collector Records in the Netherlands for digging into some weird archives to find the material for this series. Seems that the Dutch have a soft spot for Canadian rockers for which we should be grateful otherwise these songs and artists would remain ,with a couple of exceptions, largely unknown. I grew up in Vancouver BC in the 50's and 60's and so my exposure to the early R'n'R was initially through KJR in Seattle and then eventually local stations like C-FUN, CKLG & CJOR. I have to admit that since most of the songs and artists on this CD were from Toronto and Montreal, some of them I've still never heard of. Those that did become known are represented on this CD by their early, strictly Canadian works. Pretty interesting listening to these today; R. Dean Taylor, Dorothy Collins, Joce Hahn & Myrna Lorrie. Pretty Decent sound quality considering the source material. Not for everybody."
1,"greasy, stinky, and irritable...","I first purchased this because my normal tanner was out of stock. If I would have known how truly bad this stuff was, I'd rather have went without any tanner at all. While applying, instead of having a nice mist that puts a thin layer of tanner on ya, this stuff comes out like an oil can and then the smell of it hits ya...and to say the least, it's disgusting. Very disapointed. I threw away the brand new can away due to all of these issues. Horrible product!!!!"
2,Smelly-but get sublime glow micro mist from loreal instead,"I love all L'oreal products, they have a different tanning spray that I bought from Overstock since amazon this time did not over it for free shipping. This product here is very very strong smelling when you first spray it.and the smell lingers around for quite a while. The tan looks nice once you get over the smellin a couple daysThe product I can 100% recommend is L'oreal Sublime Glow Micro-mist, 4.2-Ounces"
1,I didnt like the spray can,"First off the seller was good, no problems there.The can spray nozzle was not good the spray was to heavy and went on greasy and took forever to dry.I like the look but get the sublime bronzer in the Airbrush style can."
1,Ugh,"This product is worth the money & that is all I have to say in favor of it. The seller is great fast shipping etc.. but, I should have read the reviews before I bought five of these. No matter how much you shake the can it comes out in uneven squirts instead of a steady stream. It also has a horrible fake tan smell. At best this could be used for in between touch ups if you want to even out & didn't have time to exfoliate well. The same product as this but, with the 360 degree nozzle is much better & well worth it. It drys almost instantly,there is no smell to deal with & goes on light & even with great color. Don't buy this one unless you have time to blow dry your body every time you use it because, this is very oily almost like baby oil. Also if you buy this be prepared to put old towels on your floor because, it drips everywhere.The only reason it got one star is the price."
5,The best of old and new Norwegian folk music!,"People inclined to ethnic music in general (like celtic, cajun, etc)should find this album delightful. The variety of instuments and singers are authentic examples of the best in Norwegian ethnic music!"
5,Django... Pure Django... Well worth it,"I love this CD set. When I first began to hear Django Reinhardt, I have to say it was a bit hard to ignore the terrible sound quality. Even though this is a CD set, you are not going to hear ultra low noise, crystal clear music, the way you would hear something modern. Nope. It's rough, it's live, it's raw... BUT the MUSIC... The music is what is so great in these CDs. If you like Django, this set will give you plenty! I loved that this CD set had SO MANY SONGS! KUDOS, for making it affordable. The sound quality sucks, but what can you expect from recording sessions from the 1930s! All in all, Django Reinhardt was light years ahead of his time... and he still is!!! No wonder Joe Pass and Les Paul cited him as a main influence on their playing. Listen to the music and it will wisk you off into a very special place."
3,Same as the first one,"I have purchased both the first Hotwheels movie, and Vol.1 of the episodes. This one didn't have any new twists or new turns over the story. Infact at a point they will brush off the count of how many rounds where won between the two teams. My boys injoyed it, but I guess since I get to judge it ( I gave it a three), I was thinking of my self injoynment. I guess my boys would actually give it a 4 star. All in all it was good fun for the my boys (6, 10 y/old)."
1,No patterns in this book,"There are no patterns included in this book. Without the patterns, this book is useless. Wish I had not waisted time or money. I'm returning it as soon as possible."
4,2nd shipment finally arrived,"It appears new, it took a charge and appears to be working. It would be nice to have more capacity for longer playing time, but you get what you pay for. Unlike some of the reviews, old battery never burst into flames."
4,Internal Card Reader,"Unit installs easily in a 3.5 inch bay and plugs into an internal USB header. Care is needed to insert cards to avoid misalignment, especially with CF cards to avoid bending of pins. When unit is initialized by insertion of a card, four removable drives appear in the computer directory tree. These can be disabled when not in use by closing down the USB connection from the task bar. Overall a simple and convenient unit for dealing with removable memory cards."
2,Back to Amazon with you.,"Other than the addition of a USB port (which is definitely welcome), the Sabrent ""grossly inflated number-in-one"" reader is basically the same ""cheapest you can get me"" reader that every store sells.It isn't particularly fast. It doesn't look particularly nice. It isn't built particularly well. The only thing that's especially notable, is that the 3.5"" device isn't sized properly. In no less than three cases (Antec, Silverstone, and Thermaltake), the reader had to be balanced by screws in the bay of the cases that weren't tool-less to be even. On the tool-less Thermaltake case, the reader is just small enough that it'll pop out of the retaining clip if you're not extra gentle.Since the reader itself is so mediocre, there's no reason to put up with the unfortunate manufacturing problem."
4,"Good Reader, Too Many Drive Letters","For less then fifteen bucks how can you NOT add such a functional little reader to your computer. I actually installed this instead of an 3.5"" floppy as I have no real use for a floppy now-a-days. This reader reads 64 different types of cards using 4 different input slots. It also has a handy USB port on the front of it. Since you need to use a USB motherboard port, adding the USB port on the front makes up for any lost ports if your motherboard doesnt have many USB connections. The only gripe I have with this reader is that it makes 4 drives in your ""My Computer"" (1 for each input.) I understand that there is no way to get around this and although its not that big of a deal it does clutter up your ""My Computer"" with a bunch of needless drive letters.4 out of 5 stars."
1,Horrible,"This product says ""Hi-Speed"" the transfer rate was horrible. I would say about the speed of USB 1.1 . Also the construction is terrible too, the metal case it cheap and sharp so it cuts into the cable coming out of the back. The casing is also poorly designed and pops apart without any effort. Non the less I returned it and am using an external USB 2.0 version which is lightening fast. If you do photography and have several gigs of data to transfer do not buy this item."
4,No Clear Winner,There is no clear winner in internal card readers.One important note about this one:You have to insert a compact flash card upside down.
4,"works good, Bright Blue LED","Everything works and I have no problems with it functionally, but the super bright blue LED was an eyesore, and even stays on when you power the PC off. I covered it with black electrical tape, which works great to cover LED's anywhere on a PC in case anyone is interested."
1,Bad unit+cord too short.,"Just a heads up. Unit stopped working after a week or two of use. Now it gets burning hot to the touch. USB port still works, but SD and micro SD port won't be detected anymore. On top of that, the cord that goes from the unit to the motherboard is too short and might not be enough. I had to use a USB connection that was in use already since the cord wouldnt reach the one I had available."
3,Works for me,"Works for me, holes for screws don't quite match my tower so there is a little wiggle room, but works for what I need it to do."
5,"Works, Great Deal","This card reader is an excellent deal. It was the ONLY drive I've used so far to allow me to read XD Cards in linux, which was impossible with my Aspire One's card reader. I highly recommend this product, or any Sabrent product. They have all been reliable and inexpensive. Only con is that some of the slots are upside down. Likewise, the USB port is ""upside down""."
4,Good unit for the money,"The reader has worked well, however,there is a red light which is on on the front whether the computer is on or off, making you think your computer is on. One other oddity is that some of the reader slots require the card be put in upside down. But, once you have that figured out, it does work fine and does take numerous types of cards. For the money, I doubt you can beat it."
2,Micro SD did not Work,"I bough the card reader to spare myself buying individual USB adapters for each of the different media cards that I use.The SABRENT card reader that I received was working fine for the USB, the SD and the Sony Memory Card readers; However, it was not reading the micro SD card. I did not have the chance to test the remaining card types since I do not use them. I am using windows vista 32; I tried to download the driver from SABRENT website but it is only compatible with Windows XP.Also, I noticed only 4 drive letters added under the removable hard drives after I connected the card reader but I suspect that the system should detect more letters assuming that each card slot will have a letter.I contacted SABRENT support twice with no avail; I am about to return this product back."
1,What happened ?,"Why, my order was divided in two ?I liked 4 items, and you divided in two orders: one of 3 and another for 1 !"
1,not well discribed,"The desciption did not say thay the software was only for Windows 98, luckily I found that out before I installed the actual reader, luckily my XP told me this, it wouldn't even install. Then after checking it out further I found out the plug type was not compatible with my Dell. So this thing had no chance of working with my computer. I think Tiger Direct could have been more forthcoming with this information. I am out $12.99 plus $7.49 shipping for something that will not work. So I just have to eat this thing because it is not worth it to me to pay for return shipping and then of course the obvious hassles of getting a refund."
2,Doesn't match the pictures in several ways,"* The picture shows a sleeved, rounded cable. Mine came with a ribbon cable, which was short but just long enough to do the job. This seems much more delicate, though, for installation next to roughly-hewn heatsink fins and case surfaces.* The picture shows an unbranded unit with two small LEDs. THe model I recieved has the manufacturer's name on the front bezel and two fairly large yellow LEDs. I understand that models may vary over time, but I think some people might select this unit specifically for the goal of a clean, unbranded look on their PC."
4,Just a thought,I grew up in Brooklyn in the same period that Kaufman grew up in the Bronx--the 50's and 60's. His portrayal of his parents represent very common types of the period--a mildly psychotic mother and an uneducated robotic mope of a father. These types were by no means typical of Holocaust survivors in the neighborhood who were generally quiet and dignified. Alan Kaufman had a very bad childhood but I wonder how much was due to madness and stupidity and how much was the result of the Holocaust.
5,I think this is the best of the L&H silent films,"In the second Hundred Years the boys are convicts who are desperate to be on the outside instead of the inside. After a couple offailed escape attempts they hit on the perfect plan. Some painters have just gone to lunch. They turn their stiped uniformswrong side out so they are white, grab the paint buckets and brushes and just walk out the front gate.But as with most L&H; foolproof plans there is a small problem. A nosey cop begins following them. They decide they must prove thatthey are really painters. And they paint everything in sight. The only time I ever saw anyone paint a model T Ford white. Windshield,headlights and all.It`s a great film and you laugh until your sides hurt."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"These books are suppose to come with access cards that provide a code that allow you to access content and resources made available online by the publishers. THESE SELLERS ARE DELIBERATELY REMOVING THESE CARDS AND SELLING THEM SEPARATELY FROM THE BOOK!!! That is what explains the low prices. What originally costs $100 in over-priced college campus bookstores, now costs $120 as 2 SEPARATE ITEMS! SHAME ON YOU!!!"
4,Pretty good film,"This movie was good, even though it had half and half scenery, and you could tell that Margot Finley had no idea how to skate, and the plot wasn't that original.But it did, on the other hand have good acting. And the young lovers did have chemistry.The story follows too teenagers, Ronnie (Joshua Jackson) and Julie (Margot Finley) as they fall in love, but are torn apart by their battling familys. This movie is witty and smart, though predictable in some points. But other then that it is a pretty good film."
5,IT WAS TOTALLY AWSOME,I FEEL TOTALLY 100% HEAD OVER HEELS BACKWARDS IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVEI IT WAS SO COOL AND JOSHUA JACKSON MAKE IT A PERFECT 10
5,Sturdy piece,"my husband hates wearing watches on his wrist but is constantly asking me what time it is. So I bought this for him. It is nice enough to wear with a suit, but he can wear it with jeans and it doesn't look out of place. Great gift, and my husband loves it."
1,"ONLY WORTH $24.99, NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE! IT IS THE PITS!","I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY KIDS LAST CHRISTMAS..THEY IMMEDIATELY GOT EXTREMELY BORED. THE PICTURE WAS TOTALLY DISTORTED. IT WAS A CHEAP HUNK OF JUNK! I PROMISE YOU, IF YOU BUY THIS, YOU WILL BE EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED. I RETURNED IT, THE NEXT DAY."
1,barbie video camera,"I purchased this toy for my 6 year old daughter for christmas. There was so much static that it could not be used. It was exchanged for another one, which also had so much static it had to be reurned. Thankfully it was easily returned to toys r us."
2,A toy lover,I had this toy as a gift for my B-Day and it was very cool because of all of the features it had. I was mostly happy that I found out that SOME of the Barbie Video cams had the video {when live}in black and white. I was annoyed when the second time I wanted to use it because it was not as fun. It still has the same features and it's not soo cool just like you see in comercials because they just want your money. It's not soo good as it seems but it will probably last about 1-2 days. I seriosly think you should ask mom & dad to buy you something else.Don't waste the money. It's not worth every penny.
4,Found Item On Clearance,"I found this item on clearance at a local target for $29.72, I bought it for my daughters fifth birthday. It was great she thought it was the neatest thing and came in handy when trying to send up dated video to her grandparents in other states."
2,Disappointed,"Contrary to the product description, this Barbie video camera does not have a functional external or detachable microphone, or a microphone jack. The hand-held microphone that comes with it is just a non-functional prop.The sound pick-up of the built-in microphone is very poor. The subject has to yell very loudly in order to be heard by the on-camera microphone.This toy might be worth the price if it really did have a functional external microphone.Another problem is that the viewfinder is very inaccurate. It only shows a very small portion of the camera's actual field of view."
1,This CAMERA destroyed my TV,"In just 1 afternoon of use, this camera caused my 27 inch TV to have permanent damage to the picture tube. There is now a giant discolored ring across the entire screen. No kids toy should be able to burn a giant discolored ring into a television picture tube! Avoid this at all costs or face trashing your TV! And, there wasn't anything in the instructions that stated that anything like this could happen."
2,Dissappointed child,"My daughter begged for this camera for her 8th birthday. After reading these reviews, I wouldn't waste one dime on it. She was so dissappointed as the commercials DO NOT portay a realistic portrait.It was a FAKE!!!! She says the people who made the commercial are ""STUPID!!!!!!"" I only gave it 2 stars as I suppose it would be fun for a 3 year old who wouldn't know the difference.Instead, I gave her MY older version camcorder, and she's a happy little girl now."
2,Barbie Toys,It is very said that Barbie toys are made so poorly I have 6 Daughters from the age of 14 to 1 and I have purchased them all only to find that they are all made so poorly the dont last more than 3 months before I have to trash them. They charge alot of money for toys and know they have the kids hooked Santa!
3,O.K.,"Very durable, but could not hold my youngsters attention long enough due to how complicated it is to use."
3,This is Kinda Iffy,"I got this for my daughter for her birthday last year in May & she has played with it MAYBE 3 times for no longer than 45 mintues combined!!! It was to many wires everywhere. The last time she played with it, a large yellow glowing light appeared on the television over our sofa where she was directing. We though it was the sunlight shinning in from the patio doors, or prehaps the windows, or even from the light fixtures above. NOPE, NOPE, and NOPE!!! That light would not move and only was projected on the television while she had that thing on. Needless to say we all got spooked and it has been in the box since."
3,Barbie vidoe camera,Fun toy but needs updated technology. The toy would be more funtional if it at least had a screen to see what you are taping on the recorder instead of looking at the tv.
2,Good concept price too high,"I was thrilled when this product was originally introduced because it solved the problem of whiskers everywhere. It works reasonably well, about middle of the pack for electric razors. However, I assume the product has been discontinued because the price on replacement heads is now so high it made more sense for me to go out and buy a new razor which I recently did."
5,works wonder,My brother has a hard beard and this razor and xchangecartridges makes it nice for him we are not going thourgh 2 bag of razor a week know thanks remington
1,Replace Cord Has Wrong Paddles,"While the description claimed that this was a replacement for the cord in my clipper, the ends were prepared incorrectly for my unit. I could not actualy mount it into the device.It is bascially useless to me as is."
3,Almost Cord,"The description claimed that this was a replacement for the cord in my clipper, the connecting terminals were not a direct match. This cord did not fit perfectly but works better than my broken cord. I ordered another switch unit with cord which should arrive soon."
1,i received the wrong item,i ordered a cord for A-5 CLIPPER they send me cord for Wahl trimmer and there was no phone number to call so now am stuck with this wahl trimmer cord that i have no use for and i paid for it and if i wana send it back i have to pay for shipping
4,Patti has done it again,"I found this book easy to read, and packed full of helpful information, tools, suggestions and hints. The author included several self-tests for you to discover how you communicate and give feedback. Then, once you knew where your weak areas were, there was ample material to assist you in improving. Charts give examples, case studies allow you to picture how to use what you've learned, exercises offer practice, and the graphics areappropriate and memorable. This book is for anyone who wants to improve his/her communication skills (and who among us doesn't want to do that!?).Patti covers the differences in men's and women's communication approaches, overcoming negative self-talk, and a DASR (Describe, Acknowledge, Specify, Reaffirm) technique that will guide you in your communications whether with spouse, parent, child, friend, boss, or acquaintance, throughout the rest of your life. I highly recommend it for everyone to read!"
1,Pretty bad,"I read the other reviews, but thought to myself that with my excellent skills, this should work. Boy, was I mistaken. The blade is not supported well enough and is not spinning fast enough to get a clean cut. I chewed up two windows before I went back to my chiesel."
1,It's a kung fu movie for kids but it's not worth the money,"- It's a kung fu movie for kids.- The acting is stiff, forced, and exactly like kiddy stuff.- The editing is terrible. There are a lot of scenes where they're so poorly cut and pasted that I can clearly see they are two separate scenes combined together.- The film is not funny.- Jackie Chan is one of the producers but he did not act here.- Most of the fighting scenes look amateurish. This is understandable because most of the fighters are kids and teens. However, even the main fighting scene at the last 15 minutes is not good either. Samo Hung's fighting is much better in other movies.- In short, even on the standard of family movies, this is not worth the money."
3,"Excellent Work, Mediocre Translation","__The Imitation__ is an important and unspeakably powerful work, and I find that I can only read a few pages at a time without having to put it down and consider at length what I have read. This is a well-printed and well-bound edition, but it is not the best translation. Unfortunately, what translation you are fortunate enough to use can significantly impact your spiritual experience of a work: words are everything. Instead of this translation, I would highly recommend that of Joseph N. Tylenda in the Vintage Spiritual Classics series. It is far better, not because it is more accurate literally but because it has an urgency, a forward motion, and a simplicity which make it elegant and direct. But if price is a factor, the volumes in this series from Nelson are a bargain."
2,not as rated,"product was rated new....also, sd card was to be included, no card....also, LED window was scratched...easy to understand , was put in box on it, there is no protector for this led window."
1,Worst product ever,Re-manufactured means it is like new not a scratched screen and damaged body. This thing looks like it was droped on the floor. Two stricks on amazon. (for the order they could not fill for xmas shipment even when i places the order in early november). I will take my buisness some place else!!!!!!!!
4,SONY has taken over warranty repairs on these,"I love this camera. It stops action better than others for the same price. The guy who complained about warranty just needs to go to the SONY web site because they took over the camera division of Konica Minolta. They fixed my camera very quickly, no problems at all."
1,Warranty Rip OFF,After I purchased this camera I had to send it out for repair. After I took a picture it would only store every other picture. Since Mar. 2006 I have sent it out 2 more times for the same problem. And now after I take a picture it shuts off. Now I can only use it for a paper weight. And there is no phone number listed for the repair center.
3,You pay what you get.,"I am an advanced camera enthusiast and I have at least 15 different cameras of various brands.The Konica performs well for its price and class, it does do a worse job in dark environment without flash. The focus always hunts in different shooting and even movie mode.With nice daylight, it performs OK but the quality of the picture are really so so. In my opinion, the noise level is a little bit high compare to other competitors."
4,Carla's Review,"The Konica Minolta works wonderfully, however I still haven't gotten all of my parts. Memory Card, Arcsoft videoimpression software and batteries. I really love the camera however I could have gotten a brand new one for the same price as this remanufactured one. That's what I get for not doing my homework."
3,You can safely ignore the scaremongers,"Konica Minolta is indeed stopping the manufacture of their own cameras. They are NOT going out of business.In addition, they have also said that they will continue to support their cameras.Add to that the fact that most cameras don't go wrong that often, and you may as well buy this is you are really interested in it and are willing to buy a second hand camera. Don't let the hysterical shouting in some of these reviews put you off.I gave this 3 stars because I had to give it something. I've used KM cameras before and been happy with the pictures for a point'n'shoot. No reason to think this would be otherwise.If you want a knowledgeable and independant review, search on google etc and I'm sure you'll find one (eg dpreview.com)"
4,"Dimage Z3, indoor underperformer, outdoor superstar","I've been disappointed at some points and excited at others with this camera.Whenever I use it in poor lighting or indoors, the autofocus has major difficulty. I cannot capture any movement unless the lighting conditions are perfect.However, when it's a nice day outside, my Dimage z3 gives me better pictures than I've ever experienced. Ultra-fast autofocus, antishake, with crisp, clear lines and great colors are easy to get outside.Overall, I've been very happy. Lots of options, quick startup, and very lightweight."
2,"can't take any pictures, thank you","no memory stick in it to even use, you should have explained thatwouldn't order anything again"
3,Great camera for outdoor daylight photography,"I've been using this camera for almost 2 years. This is really a great outdoor camera. The 12x zoom, the image stabilization work really great. The picture quality is very nice. The body of the camera is very well designed and is really easy to use. But this camera is really weak when it comes to low light conditions. It fails many a times to focus on the subject. The picture quality, if you manage to take a picture in dark, is really bad.If only this camera was built with a focus assist lamp, it'd been the best in its range."
5,Love this Camers,"I have been using this camera for some time now. It takes some of the best pictures ever. The only thing is that it is big not small, and will not fit in your pockect"
5,Creationism versus Evolution,"An indispensable book for those who wish to defend Creationism versus Evolution. Fantastic scientific research and little-known facts put the theory of evolution where it belongs - a false theory. Doesn't disregard dinosaurs, in fact proves that man and dinosaur co-existed. Fascinating read."
5,Fine Quality Parchment Paper,I purchased this for a genealogy project I was working on. I printed w/ an epson artisan 720 and was able to use the auto-duplex printing feature with no problem even though this is pretty heavy paper.
2,Paper really messed up my copier,"I have gotten this paper before with no complaints, but this batch I got was so slippery and it really gunked up the copier as the print wouldn't stick to the paper. The repair man said it was way too slippery and no setting on the copier seemed to help. It was very disappointing as the price is great and I have had good results before. Hopefully it was just the batch I got."
5,Great!,This inexpensive parchment is great stuff... Its perfect for so many printing applications... It will make anything you print look better! Bravo
4,Excellent information straight from the professionals.,Great book full of information. Step-by-step process outlined by the best in the bussiness. After reading this book I had a better understanding of the whole painting process.
3,Overpriced,"Yes, this product works. I bought it for the dog, because it's DEET-free. The bottle is tiny and pricey. It lasted less than 3 weeks."
1,Save your money.,"If you can get this for free (with rebates) then you might want to take your chances with this awful, unreliable, unstable software. Otherwise, invest in PC Anywhere or another more reliable well known brand. PLEASE BE WARNED...I dont recommend installing this without backing up your system first....and then GOOD LUCK using it.btw- I did not order this thru amazon. I am just trying to get the word out on this troublesome, worthless software. The one star is for the pretty packaging ;\"
4,Progressive Black Metal,"Passionate, complicated, progressive black metal. Solace is a musical masterpiece and needs to be listened to over and over again to get all one can out of it. (Check out the jazz-infuenced drums throughout, woah!) The overall sound offers listeners something different than everything else out there.The lyrics are very poetic and are more focused on communicating feelings and experiences than the propositional truths of the Christian faith. While the creativity in the lyrics is a plus, I wanted to see more biblical content.The packaging is excellent: Cover art, liner, photos - all very good.My opinion: Musically superior to most out there. The lyrics are creative, but too vague for me."
5,Higashi Glaser illustrations are always superior,"With so much Hello Kitty stuff out there (Walmart, Target, who knows where), it's hard to know if you're going to getting something that truly feel Sanrio-standard. But all these Higashi Glaser books are so well illustrated. We have all of them (Hello World, Hello Colors, Hello USA). The simple, bold images are great for very little kids, but are so lovely and interesting that older kids will love the book too (my kids are 2 and 4, and I love it as a 30-year-old). A great addition to your Christmas story collection. And it comes with punch-out cardboard ornaments at the end."
2,waste of money,It took almost a month to arrive.My cat does not care about it.The only positive thing I can say is that the grass did grow fast and is OK as (expensive) decorative flower...
4,Nice to have - cats like it,"Cats were eating the grass too fast, so it never really got to the point where it could regrow what they had eaten. You can order refills, but it's easier to just get them in a whole foods store."
4,chia cat glass planter,I own a Chia Cat Grass Planter and am very happy with it and the cats love it!! I also purchased one for a friend who recently rescued two cats and her cats also like it. It has a very whimsical design which appeals to cat lovers.
2,The grass did not grow well,"My main problem with this product was that the grass came in very spotty. I'd say in total I had 20 individual pieces of grass. It did not look anything like the picture. I think the seeds were old or bad. On a good note, my cat did enjoy the grass that came in. For that reason, I may try this product one more time and see if I have the same problem."
1,Fell Apart,"I do appreciate the quick response from this company when complaining about the product and I was able to get my money back without a problem. I got this for my husband for Valentine's Day, but the moment he opened the box and pulled it out, it fell apart. When he went to pull out one of the four removable padded braces (one of the pieces that you put your watch on)...as he pulled that out, the whole turntable came out (the part that your watch would be spinning on)...it appeared the glue they used to hold the whole thing in place just didn't hold up. And when he tried the other side, the same thing happened. It was obvious this was a piece of junk, so we returned it. I should have known the price was too good to be true."
5,"Umm, Hello!","I'm 13 and have been playing and wanting Bratz since they started. I want them all. Yasmin and Jade are my favorite, there clothes I wish I had their clothes. The Boyz are hott. The girls are adorable. If I had them all that would be so cool. There arems can pop of but its easy to fix. There head might fall off, but you can fix that. You might cut there hair but you also can fix that, by buying another doll. Of course keep the clothes. If you want more just by. How simple is that? I think just in case you do cut the hair off it should come with another head of the same excact one. But who'd want to cut the hair off? Also if boys think that whoever plays with these are wusses, your the wuss, girls like guys(or at least I do) that are brave enough to play with a doll, you won't die. My mom and dad l;ove these toys, they so cute and fun. So don't you dare say there just for little whimpy kids. See Ya-Megan"
1,THIS TOY SUCKS!,"THIS TOY STINKS! IT STINKS SOOO BADLY, I JUST WANTED TO TEAR ITS HEAD OFF! ( wich I did )THEN I THREW IT IN THE TRASH! THIS THING IS A PIECE OF DODO! ITS HORRIBLE! DONT BUY IT!"
1,Ugly and Stupid!,I love bratz rock angelz but they're both sooooooo ugly! But I totally love bratz! #1 fan bratz #1 hate barbie and my scene.
3,"good book, but not if your college class is using the new edtion","this book is fine if you just need to learn grammar, but if you're in a college class that is using the new edition, GET THE NEW EDITION! THIS BOOK'S EXERCISES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE CLASS. i read one review, i think from an ebay seller, that said this book was almost identical to the new edition, but that's a lie. although the information in this book is perfectly useful, if you need it for class participation you'll have to buy the new edition."
4,JVC Mini Audio system,This is a big unit and it is heavy. The sound is great as is the CD changer. I do not care for the wire antenna I would much preferred a regular metal antenna. I also do not like the timer it is difficult to re-program to turn it off.The unit does not have a memory so you must reset everything when you have a power blip.
3,Can't Watch Length Of Songs,"If this feature is important to you ... One downside is that you can't watch the length of the song you are listening to for more than about 60 seconds due to the system continually reverting to its ""marketing"" mode of flashing lights each time you try to press the button to see how long the song has been playing."
1,Not your mother's KitchenAid,"KitchenAid may be know for high quality appliances, but this certainly is not one of them.Cool retro design does not make up for poor build quality and performance. This machine grinds fine espresso to coarse French press. The problem is you get the whole range of grinds every time you use it, regardless of the setting you've selected. It is noisy. It is messier than other countertop mills.The final act for this machine was when the motor shaft pins sheared off, leaving the motor to whine and the burr unable to grind. I considered having it repaired, but why bother? It went to the trash bin. Good riddance!If you really want good grinds, buy one of the European models and plan on spending $150 or more. Hey, that's only a month's worth of daily Starbucks. And you'll have great coffee at home."
2,Big Disappointment For Burlesque Fan,I ordered this DVD hoping it would have interesting footage as well as fascinating historical commentary since it is listed as a documentary. But instead we have a series of short stag films showing strippers acts but the quality of the films leave much to be desired. Especially with Sally Rand where the footage is so faded and blurry that it is hard to watch. With some shorts there is no name of the performer. Better choices for burlesque DVD footage are Behind The Burly Q and Striptease: The Best Exotic Dancers of all Time. The extra feature of Teasearama is nice but I already had that videotape footage. Considering the price this DVD is a complete rip-off. Don't waste your money.
2,"Abacos VHS tape low quality, low content","Was not very helpful wrt cruising information for the area, rather amateurish, poor video quality, better than nothing but only just!"
4,Old vs New,"If this were a single containing just tracks 9-10 it would have gotten 5 stars....likewise if it only contained Pitchfork and the early demos. However, the new and old tracks have no business being on the same disc. IMO the new songs are superior to most of the songs on the new album, and could have easily replaced some of the instrumentals and covers that we got instead.Tracks 5-8 are great examples that lend some insight into the evolution of the tracks on TSL. Most of them use lyrics that made their way into other songs on their debut album.If anything, this release shows you how much Clutch's sound has changed (for good or bad depending on who you ask) since their first release.It's definitely worth getting just for the new songs alone--and if you don't own the original Pitchfork it's a no-brainer"
5,Inebriate Meee!!,"Ah yes, the classics from Pitchfork - it is Clutch at their most angry and aggressive - no need to downtune - the Bacchannal demo is cool b/c its a bit faster than the album version - one of their most THRASH-worthy songs and one of my personal faves - it shows CLuTch is still proud of their past and haven't forgotten their roaring roots - worth the spend for any true CLUTCH fan - They are Underground Legends"
4,Raw and Good,"While not my favorite Cd from Clutch this is got some really good music. My Clutch life start late and with Blast Tyrant, so this was a good progression."
3,This was okay,"My husband loves clutch, he said this album was just ok. He enjoyed some of the older stuff much more. Blast tyrant is one of the better albums out."
4,Great Little Amp for the Price,"I purchased this amp years ago and it's still going strong. I traded my Fender tube amp for a Les Paul and just needed something small to practice with in the house. While the sound obviously does not compare, I'm happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a sub-$150 small apartment amp."
3,thought was something different,"I anxiously awaited it's arrival, I thought it was something different and I ended up just hating it and hating myself to subject me to something as vile as this!!"
3,satisfied but flawed,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my daughter and it worked really well for her. She loves it. But when my husband went to put it together, the drawer was busted. I had already had it for a month put up for Christmas so he just glued it back together. It is very pretty but the shipping neededs inprovement or they need to check it better before packaging it to send."
4,Nice Vanity for Little Girls.,"I ordered this vanity for my 7 year old granddaughter for Christmas. Delivery was very prompt. The vanity was very nice for the price. It is well made. The only negative is that the stool fabric is very old-fashion and I did re-cover it with a fabric that is more appropriate for a young girl. I did see someone's review mentioning the stool fabric so I figured I would have to change it. Other than that, I am very please with the vanity and would not hesitate to buy again."
2,Picture is misleading,"I bought this set based in part on the picture. I wanted a stool with a cream colored pattern to match my room. It arrived when I was out and my family members put it together for me. When I got home, the actual pattern on the stool was a rust-colored floral that did not match at all. The seller will not accept returns on assembled items so I'm stuck with a horribly ugly stool and a cheap looking vanity with a drawer that boasts a gaudy red velvet lining. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.That being said, it was fairly easy to assemble, from what I understand. So it has that going for it."
4,Very sturdy & pretty,"I only have one complaint. This vanity set is advertised as oak finish wood. The legs & mirror frame are solid wood, but the top is presswood.. It serves my purpose very well, since I am 82 & needed a place to sit down to fix my hair, etc."
5,Great Purchase,"This Vanity Set is of top quality and we have had many compliments on it. We purchased for our 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it and the size it just right. The only problem we had was the stool had been pushed into the packing box and when it was one corner piece was broken and the side was cracked, we were unable to use the stool. We are contacting the vendor for replacement, otherwise we will have to have it fixed. A great purchase for the money."
3,good side and bad side,"I bought this item months ago and really liked it. It looked beautiful, stylish and lid fit perfect. Used about 2 weeks, the blue coating on the bottom started chip off. One day, suddenly I heard a huge pop sound when the wok on the stove. I fliped it over and saw more than 2/3 coating on the bottom were gone and spreaded all over the kitchen. Some peices even flew into my dishes. It was unexpected experience and I sent it back. I am still looking for the perfect one.Other facts you may consider before buy: heated pretty slow, still stick a little and quite heavy."
5,Perfect,"Peeeeerfect. Small, light, dishwasher safe, microwavable, portable & storable with lid, durable, cheap, what else do you look for for baby bowls!"
5,great for day care!,"We bought these to help take food to daycare and they hold just the right amount of food for our 10 month old son, can be put in the microwave and come clean on the top rack of the dishwasher...very convenient."
3,eh,3 lids are solid and one is vented for microwaving. . .. truly I wish there was a 4th real lid. These bowls are a little bit shallow for my tastes.
3,"4 bowls, but only 3 solid lids","I like these bowls for sending lunch items for my preschooler - they are solid and a nice size. Over time, the lids tended to disappear, so I purchased a new package, mainly because I need the covers. When they arrived, I found that the package contained 4 bowls, but only 3 solid lids, the 4th lid is ""vented"", only usable for microwaving - it is not leakproof or airtight. I wish this was clearly stated in the description. 4 stars for the bowls, but 3 stars for the description and misleading packaging."
2,NOT Microwave Safe,"These bowls are very basic and good for storage. However, they are NOT microwave safe despite the product description. I bought them intending to be able to quickly microwave food for baby but unfortunately can't so they get a low review."
2,A little disappointed,"The color was totally different from the picture I saw. And the containers are not transparent, so you can't see the food inside. But they function ok."
2,Too Small,It is really small. Smaller than you can expect. Pay attention to the size you want! I hope there's a picture to show the comparsion with other items.
3,Some Food Caught on Fire in Microwave,"First, the good: These bowls are great for transporting food. They are the perfect size for baby- or toddler-sized portions, and the lids are snug.Now, the bad: The bowls should not be marketed as being microwavable. Some foods heated up fine these bowls, but others -- including broccoli and sweet potatoes -- caught on fire after being microwaved for only about 10 seconds! This makes me nervous about what sort of chemicals the bowls contain. I will not be using them for any foods that require heating and actually have some reservations about using them for any food."
3,easily get scratch,When u use spoon to press food it will caused scratch on it. Size is just quite small. Won't suggest for toddler.
3,"Used to love 'em, now I just like 'em","When I first bought these bowls three months ago, I thought they were super. The size was exactly what I needed, and the lids were secure. We use them to store Cheerios and pureed baby food (not for travel, just at home in the fridge). We wash them by hand, and sometimes we heat foods directly in these bowls. They are now starting to stain and leave marks at the bottom from heating foods in the microwave, I guess. Also, Cheerios don't seem to stay as fresh anymore in the lidded bowls, so I am assuming the seal on the lid isn't as strong as it was before. That being said, I'm looking to replace them, but I am not crazy about the other bowls available on Amazon. These Gerber bowls have the right size and shape, they don't have suctions, and they are a good price. I think I like them enough to replace them with the same brand."
3,Starting to change shape,"These are okay. But, a few times in the dish washer and they are starting to change shape. Because of that it makes it really hard to get the lid on the bowls. I use the bowls to take food to daycare and to feed my son at home. But I am having a hard time now getting the lids on them for daycare so I will have to find another route for his food.There are four bowls and four lids, but one lid has holes in it for microwaving."
2,Just Barely Not Terrible,"I bought these bowls because my little one started eating more than the Tommee Tippee Pots that I had (and loved) could hold. Leak proof is essential since I shuttle a few meals a day to day care, so I thought I'd try these. They are leak-proof (well, three of the four are) and that's the only saving grace. The fourth lid is not-so-helpfully a ""microwave ready"" one that has cut outs for venting and no cover for the vents. The lids are definitely not microwave safe; they lasted exactly 24 hours in the house before one got warped so badly that the baby sitter couldn't get it back on once she fed my little one the contents. Though the things are emblazoned all over with ""BPA Free,"" the plastic feels so gross and flimsy that I can't help but wonder what else is leeching into my little one's food every time I've microwaved them (without the lids). Suffice it to say, the quest continues and, thankfully, it didn't set me back more than a couple of bucks."
5,Great for Serving and Storing Baby Food,"I love these little bowls with the lids. The lids fit on tightly. You can actually put puree in the bowl, snap on the lid, and throw it in the diaper bag without worrying about leaks! Fabulous. I make my own baby food and freeze it in small portions, so these bowls also work perfect for thawing. I put a serving in the bowl, snap on the lid, and put it in the fridge to thaw overnight. They are lightweight, so they also make a good ""toy"" for the baby in a pinch. I would definitely recommend these to a friend."
4,They're Bowls,"If you're looking for good little plastic bowls for snacks and baby portions of food, these will do the trick. The lids don't fit tight enough for transportation of liquid-containing foods in a bag, but will work fine in a fridge where they can sit upright. I'm trying to weed out plastics, but I like these for taking dry snacks to day care. The stuff stays in the bowl and when it's time to eat, the dish is already included."
5,Gerber Bowl = Perfect,These bowls were exactly what I needed. The lids are extremely tight so everything stays on the inside. Perfect to just pack rice cereal in and put in baby bag...no worry. Easy to clear and can be stored stacked. Great deal!
3,Steve Austin Master of Mayhem,"These matches were taken from the USWA around 1990. Pretty cool DVD for nostalgia reasons. The only thing i didn't like was that the tag match with Gary Young was cut short, very short. the rest of the video is pretty decent though. note that the crowd is really into the action even during the dull moments. None of the matches are history making, but for the price and to see a little early Steve Austin rookie footage it is very worth it."
3,Good pub food,"If you need more inspiration to cook typical pub fare, you'll find the recipes in American Brasserie well laid out. It presents one recipe per page, with the ingredient deck in bold toward the margin and clear instructions down the center. There are about 20 illustrations organized in groups so you'll need to go search for these presentation suggestions. Comments at the end suggest good wines to pair with each recipe.American Brasserie includes 180 recipes, most for good, hearty foods. Lots of these duplicate recipes I've seen in other places. About a dozen of the desserts were worth further attention."
2,"Uh Oh, Now For The Other Side","First, let me explain that I absolutely adore Gale Gand's show Sweet Dreams and I love her Butter, Sugar, Flour, Eggs cookbook. I've made a lot of her recipes and they always come out great. But, this book has too many ingredients that are hard to find, unusual, time-consuming, (you get the picture). Also, it doesn't help matters that our home is totally alcohol-free. I consistently read & collect cookbooks and I felt I needed to cast an opinion to keep the reviews ""fair and balanced."""
3,Instant attraction,"Back Cover description: Damian Skouras thought he was allergic to marriage, and Laurel Bennett didn't make it to the church on time....But, still, they collided as guests at the Wedding of the Year. Damian hadn't been looking for commitment, and Laurel didn't date macho Greek men....But their mutual physical attraction was red-hot, and soon Damian was insisting that they heave a wedding of their own!Between them, Laurel and Damian set off fireworks you'll long remember, especially when a night of wild passion leads to a marriage Laurel doesn't want-but Damian demands-in this, the first story in Sandra Marton's sizzling new trilogy!OK not bad, the girlfriend really was a creep. He's so rich, I can't believe he would not realize what she'd do, or that he wouldn't change the locks on his flat."
2,"Junk, not for more than a few garments","I got two of these and put one of them together and hung about 40-50 shirts and a few pants on it and it collapsed within 2 days. The plastic anchors for the poles are junk and drop the poles with any load. If you want to hang more than 20 items (10 each side) you better look elsewhere, I have taken one back and as soon as I can put this one back in the box I am sending it back. Junk from Taiwan."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!! 0 stars!,"This thing looks great, but broke just after one use! I was hanging tutus on it, and tutus are not heavy! During the process of putting it together one piece cracked, I needed it for an event, and I thought it would be ok even with the little crack. I put it together the rest of the way. Long story short it fell over and cracked more cheap plastic pieces. When I bought it the stupid thing was 39.99! I wasted $40.00. I cannot get a refund because I did not use it within the first 30 days of purchase. The only thing lighter you could hang on it is feathers, and I have my doubts. Total and complete junk. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
4,Sturdy,We purchased this rack here at Amazon. It was easy to assemble (we didn'tneed to even see the diagram chart). We installed the caster rollers tomove it about - but it seems sturdier without them. It is holding 30 lbsof clothes on the top rack and 30 on the lower rack and it seems notbe swaying in anyway. It wobbles only one moving on its wheels with the60 lbs on it. So we came to a conclusion that it is better WITHOUT them (thecaster rollers) unless you really need to move it about on a daily basis.Its fine for its price.Daniel James Tyler (Danxo; The WJ Group)
2,Double Garment Rack Not what It's wRACKED up to be.,"I ordered the double garment rack for Chorus garments, but it is proving to be a challenge. The good thing is, when I first put it together, the black bars that go across to hold the double racks broke, and the clips used to snap them in place broke as well. I contacted the seller and was promised new pieces would be sent--they were! This time they held up. However, since I have been working with it, the top rod has come apart a few times and now the black stopper on one end has cracked. it's duct taped together and is working OK. The main trouble is the 2 rods which go across the bottom are not enough to secure the frame in place so it wobbles sometimes.Good service---thanks. However, the product is not really what it's wRACKED up to be."
1,flimsy,"I didn't want to shell out for a more expensive garment rack (there are some really pricey ones out there!) so I bought this. It was not a breeze to assemble, but I eventually figured it out. My main complaint is that this is not sturdy enough to hold even half of it's stated capacity. I only filled it halfway and this thing is leaning like a cholo."
1,Don't Buy it,"Adjustable plastic switch broke very easily. Overall I'm not happy with this product. Not worth the price. Threw out the box, and now I can't return it."
1,Doesn't hold up!,I bought this a year ago and it just recently broke. The plastic casing in which the metal bars insert is not sturdy enough.
1,Not worth it,This product is not great. All parts snap in and there are no screws to hold things in place. I hung clothes on both sides and within a few hours the entire structure was a twisted mess on the floor. I even tried taping the poles to hold them in place on the ends. It will hold about 10 items on each side but anything more than that it will collapse to the floor.
1,do not purchase,The product arrived on time. The instructions were fair and assembling the rack was a no brainer. The problem started when I put the clothes on the rack. The plastic clips that hold the cracked immediately. Do not waste your money.
4,double handing rack,"I would order the straight single one instead of the double rack only because of the space it takes up. It holds a lot of clothing but it must be balanced, and it does take up space with the hangers on both bars. It is a good deal if you have the space tho."
3,No tools required,"I was disappointed that no tools were required in assembly = NO TOOLS REQUIRED to disassemble. It is composed of plastic snap locks to hold the bars at their height, everything else was assembled by fitting them in the opening and when you try to move the rack it is flimsy. It could have used more secure bracing. Otherwise the size of the unit itself is perfect."
2,good overview of the classical just-war position,"The just-war position has often been misunderstood and wrongly applied to try justify conflict that has already begun. This book does a good job of returning to a classic understanding of the theory of a just war. However, the author makes some large assumptions about the state of humanity and forgets that we are incapable of perceiving justice in a manner that is in a state of grace without the flaws of sin and subjective judgment."
4,Could Cro-Magnons really could talk as well as they do here?,"I read this book two years ago and I liked it, but I thought I'd forget it soon. However, some of the simple but pure phrases and scenes have stayed with me since then. I don't know why, but I remember Maroo's making tea, her grandmother about to sacrifice herself for the community good, her trek over the cold mountains with the dog and her special fire. The more I think about this book, the more I remember how much I enjoyed it. Because it's not long and has simple language, you may think it's a quick read, but it's actually well-researched, interesting and stays with you."
4,Pretty Good,"Getting started it was boring but after a while it got interesting. The only good book I've read for summer book reports! The descriptions were good without going overboard, like most authers do."
5,"Excellent story. We read it out loud for the whole family (8, 11, adults).",It is true to life and includes one death. The story also shows well just what it might have been like for people living during that time. A lot of discussion resulted from the story and we all learned from the story and the questions.
3,"Bad feature, good short",I am an aspriring filmmaker and have seen this DVD. I agree with the other reviews here but must add that any filmmaker interested in a good horror film on a no budget needs to check the short film on this DVD. This short film is called Y2K: Shutdown Detected and is a special bonus on this disc. There is also a great behind the scenes of this short on the dvd. I wasn't happy with the feature but the short made it worth my money.Thank you.
4,Aria da Capo?,"Helton, cuyo nombre significa la diosa nordica del inferno (Hel-) y un pueblo (-ton), toca cinco harmonicas. Su cancion molesta a cada persona del pueblo del sur de Texas. Pero, lo importante: la gente aprende vivir con el sin molestacion. Su cancion ha cambiado; ahora la cancion es como la voz del viento. Mi prof me ha dicho que esta historia es como la ""Aria da Capo"" de Amy Lowell. Pues no conozco este poema. Hazme favor de escribirme de quien es esta Amy y que es la significancia de esta repeticion? Os recomiendo que compreis esta novelita. Y en seguida que me podreis ayudar a entender."
1,broken hearted little boy,"Where to start.. ordered a blue guitar, got a black one. String broke out of the box. Couldn't tune at all. Then the bridge totally came off! very upset, my son was so excited to have a guitar. oh there is no where to attach the strap too, and the zipper was broke on the case. We are a musical family and he loves them. Now he can't even play it. will try and return it. Will never order from them again"
3,disappointing,My grandson really wanted a guitar that has a strap and carrying case. He is only 5 years old and to be honest I don't think it is worth half what I paid for it. The strap is cheap with no way to attach it to the guitar. It is not worth anything. He seems to be enjoying it despite not being able to attach strap but it doesn't seem to be very sturdy. I have bought first act instruments for my other grandkids from Amazon several times. They are a much better value for around the same cost.
2,Not even made well enough to be a toy.,"This thing was pu together so poorly, it came broken. I would'nt want another one ! Its not even a good toy."
5,Glad this film was found and restored so new generations can have it,"Valentino is really a legend, I think I haven't seenanother actor with that carisma that he had. He wasvery handsome!"
5,Beyond the Rocks dvd,"The service was great, thanks - wish there were prints of the other 3 Hollywood films my ancestor appeared in!"
1,Never received it,"Supplier advised the video was not available, and Amazon refunded the charge. So I never received it, and found it hard to believe that a seller could list an item without having it for shipment. Bad deal."
3,Not good for outdoor use.,"Have used several of these over the years. The device works well, however due to the materials used it begins to rust very soon. Once this happens it is useless. I have used plastic or aluminum wrap to protect it from the elements. It is a pain to have to unwrap every time an adjustment to the line has to be made. If they made this device with rust-resistant material this would be a great product."
5,All Canadian,"Find this book all Canadian format with great information on cooking game. Also, very good with the illustrations, for kids and adults."
3,Okay,"The thing I liked most about this movie was the way it captured the spirit of the times. The dot com bubble had burst but nobody new how bad things were going to get with September 11 just around the corner. Hartnett is quite convincing in the role and I enjoyed it to an extent, although it dragged in places. I wasn't sorry to see this arrogant young man brought undone, and I liked the irony of the Buddha statue which he gave to his parents as a gift from the company. He is forced to let go of everything he's built shortly after on his own way towards wisdom and enlightenment."
2,video,great it has bowie and was at excellent price but the movie was boring-the product and deliver were excelent
3,Good introduction,"This book is a good introduction to the Russian Revolution for middle and upper grade readers. It is interesting enough to keep them reading, without bogging down in too much detail. It doesn't give much political insight, however. It is mostly interesting for introducing the story of the Romanovs in a sympathetic way, through the eyes of a young girl."
2,A well-meaning failure,"This is just one more of those books written based not on facts but on other people's books. The author has taken the popular overly-simplistic view of the Tsar and made him look like a leader likely to lose control (an image far from the truth). The exploitation of his family in the story is in fact a little offending. This is another attempt to find the answer to why a country like Russia (so stable and so rich in 1914) suddenly collapsed into the chaos of revolution. Even though the attempt is made, it is a failure. The author resorts to simplifying the situation to the point of making it a fairy tale."
1,total waste,"My daughter recieved this toy as a birthday gift, and I am so glad that we didn't pay for it! After getting it all unpackaged and cleaned as directed she set it up and began using it. The right arm did not even work, this toy is suppose to stir the lemonade and nothing happened. It pours in the mix with the left arm and thats all. I tried contacting the manufactures customer Service line and that has been disconnected... Tells you something right there don't it. Web searching for this company produced little results as well... Don't waste your time or money."

1,scary,this has to be the worst single EVER and ally and aj are the worst singers ever and i thought raven was bad thing is all these disney singers are terrible and now they are getting an albulm?????????????????????????????????????crazy
1,Poor Quality Book,"The bad news:-- The few maps are woefully inadequate.-- In this computer age, there is NO EXCUSE to omit an index.-- Uninspired and thin writeups.-- No trail summary, listing in one place a table of all the hikes with length, difficulty, elevation change, ... for each.The good news:-- This hiking book won't increase hiker density, meaning increased chance of solitude.-- It is indeed small and portable."
3,"Good, but there are better out there","I got this, then ultimately ended up getting the Falcon Guide book instead, which had almost all of the same hikes and was better written/thought out. Still, this is a good book, but the Falcon Guide is better."
4,Good but outdated since 2003 publication,"Los Cabos has changed sooo much since 2003 that this is very outdated; I have had this book since 2004 and it has much good extra info on words and food descriptions, as well as travel tips, and it is light and easy to pack; thin and takes up no space. Recommended for those reasons if you don't mind outdated info."
1,A waste of money.,"Wonder why the authors do not allow you to preview a page out of the book? Because if they did you wouldn't buy it. The listed restaurants are vaguely described with a brief 4 or 5 sentences, the Los Cabos tourist traps are well represented and the guide even comes with a handy pronunciation guide, for example; Salsa (SAL-sah), Taco (TAH-ko)! Well at least that was good for a laugh! If you have a guide book to the Los Cabos area it will certainly have better recommendations. If you want to eat with the rest of the gringos that just poured off the cruise ships than this is the guide for you!"
1,Truly Disappointing!,"I purchased this before my Christmas vacation to Los Cabos and was disappointed as soon as it arrived. After using it; I just threw it away. You can find all of the restaurants listed in the free ""Gringo Gazette"" when you get there and this ""guide"" does not offer any ""out of the way"" recommendations or local ""insight."" It recommends the chain Ruth's Chris steakhouse, which was one of the better restaurants but I would expect more. [...] Some of the recommendations were closed and many were just simply really bad!"
2,OK Concert - Poor Audio,"I was really looking forward to this, I've seen Cheap Trick live, and they really put on a good show. I don't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio. It is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse - muffled audio, and underpowered vocals. I have a 5.1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert DVD that I've ever heard. I'm giving it 2 stars because I think it was a good show to see live (if you were there), but the audio quality (or lack of it) ruined it for me."
3,"Excellent performance, poor quality DVD","It is a shame that such good and inspired performance havebeen wasted by such poor production (by Image, nevertheless!)Video is very poor, but it is common for many concerts. What isreally terrible is audio, DD 5.1 surround sounds like poor old ProLogic, everything as squished, there are no dynamics, imageor anything to write home about.One may hope that one day they can remaster it.5 for performance, 1 for production, 3 average."
4,Cheap Trick and Family!,Although the video on this disc is no differn't than watching a VHS tape (when you expect alot more from a DVD and that's the Only reason for knocking off one star) the 2 hour and 15 minute performance is Excellent! It's great to see Rick and Robin's kids up there jamming on stage with the band and I really thought it was very nice of the band to bring back Jon Brant to go up and play bass on a few songs although you really can't hear his bass (makes you wonder did Tom mix this) There are lots of cool extras on this DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves melodic pop rock.
4,Why are they not in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame? Cheap Trick Rules!,"Rock n Roll Hall of Fame will not be legitimate until Cheap Trick is elected. This DVD is proof they are America's greatest living Rock n Roll Band.Robin Zander is america's premiere Rock N Roll singer, second to none. Rick Nielsen is an awesome songwriter who has penned dozens of hits that are highlighted here. Plus Nielsen's guitar chops and axewielding are still going strong. Tom Peterson the inventor of the 12-string Bass keeps the hooks coming like a second lead guitar player and maintains the backbeat with Bun E. Carlos.These guys are putting on a Rock N Roll clinic for the ages here and it is a shame they are not more truly appreciated.My only gripe with the DVD is that one of the main cameras is overexposed and the camera work is really that of a B-Crew. That is the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 ... as Cheap Tricks performance is fantastic!"
1,Disappointment,I was very excited to see a Cheap Trick song I've like forever on a You-Tube video. The reviews said it was the best live concert dvd on the market so I purchased it. I found the quality of the sound and video were terrible! It looked and sounded like it was recorded by a cheap cell phone. The one I bought must have been a black market copy. Very disappointed.
1,opion,asked for only in blue ray got this wont open it. want to return for abluy ray version or a credit to another. thanks but no thanks kris
1,will it work?,The piece broke apart. The spring came loose when taking it off the blade to clean the machine. Not strongly recommended.
1,A Book That Diminishes the Place Of the Roma .,"I find this book personally insulting and full of revisionist conclusions. As a Romani who lost Grandmother and many Aunts and Uncles in the Porrajmos (the devouring in Romany)I am outraged that once again we, the victims of this insanity are blamed for the crimes committed against us. That ANY victims of the Holocaust are essentially blamed for their own demise is cruel and unjustified. I also contest, and detest, Mr. Lewy's conclustion that the Roma people were not racially marked for extermination: this is both absurd and untrue as withnessed by the nazi's own words, we were ""lives unworthy of life, we were criminals due to our genetics, Germany must be cleansed of the Gypsy plague"" etc. An inaccurate book full of racial sterotypes, the gist of which was used by the nazi's as justification for the extermination of the Roma in the first place and is still being used to justify the persecution of Roma today. Horrid book."
2,had to force myself to read,"I really wanted to read this book. I've read a lot about the Nazi persecution of Jews, as well as their persecution of Russians, Slavs, homosexuals, anarchists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on. But I hadn't read much about their persecution of the Roma, or Gypsies, and I wanted to learn about it. But the book is extraordinarily dry. The author did not bring the events to life at all. It's pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting, but the author succeeded. What's worse, really, was that as other reviewers suggested, there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the Roma. I was very disturbed by this. I give the book two stars instead of one because I did learn a few things. But I will be looking for another book on the subject, because I didn't learn enough."
4,Hitler's other victims,"Long ignored by most historians is the plight of the Gypsies at the hands of the nazis.Subjected to every indignity and persecution as the Jews of Europe yet often ignored by most historians except brief. Often subjected to grizly medical experiments by men such as Mengele. Many of the photos of his victims are in fact of Gypsy children.This book gives a good scope of what the nazis did to them.But like most, it does not give a solid number on how many were murdered by the nazis. Nobody knows. Few Censusus covered them. Few records were kept. More often than not, they were shoved into the same trains as the Jews and gassed with them.There are many gaps but this book does at least do some justice."
2,URL mentioned below,"For some reason the URL I mention below has been expunged from my review.[URL]Additionally, the information there, re: the Holocaust and Roma and Sinti, bears much more of a relation to the human suffering imposed on these people than Lewy`s cold, insensitive book , with it`s ""neutral"" posturing at the expense of a people he himself professes to find reason to dislike.Nicholas"
1,Denying Genocide,"Guenter Lewy seems to have one mission in life: to prove that there was only one genocide in world history, that of the Jewish people during WWII, and that no other ethnic or religious groups have ever been victims of genocide. In recent years, he has been publishing one book after another that attempt to demonstrate that various peoples (American Indians, Gypsies, Armenians) were never victims of genocide. To achieve his objective, he makes a selective use of historical documents, using only the ones that corroborate his thesis, and ignoring those that would prove him wrong. His reading of history is permeated with bias. I recommend anyone to read the negative review of this book by a world-class scholar of genocide, Robert Melson, in Holocaust and Genocide Studies (vol. 16, no. 1, 2002)."
3,"Great visuals, pretty good story","Dark Horse comics have a gift for making Star Wars comics that are almost as visually appealing as the movies themselves. And their stories are usually very good, too. With this volume, though--which focuses on Biggs Darklighter--they try to explain how Biggs goes from (in the novelization and the outtake scenes that all us fanboys have memorized along with the rest of the movie) a young Imperial who's about to jump ship to an experienced and trusted Rebel pilot in about four days. It's a good story, but it's still hard to make the timeline work."
3,"Not Hot, Low Grade Fever Here","While this album of tunes might be more traditional than Lien's Prisme recording, it lacks the vitality that makes the other so satisfying a listen. The pacing of her playing on Felefeber is somewhat stead and becomes a bit monotonous after the first few tracks. The selections seem to be in closely related keys, which only adds to this lamentable affect. Her playing is competent thoughout, even masterful, but uninspired."
2,Very disappointed,"I loved the platter but it was sent to me with a large chip on the side. The piece was not in the box so I assume it was sent to me broken. Also when I ordered the platter I had placed an order for 12 of their place setting of Johnson Brothers Friendly Village to match the platter and Amazon cancelled the order. These items were available when I purchased them, they were in stock and would be delived before Christmas. But, I feel I got these place setting at such a great price they didn't want to sell them to me and cancelled my order. I don't think they thought someone would order 12 of them. I have purchased a lot of things from Amazon but this is really disappointing. I really wanted these dishes for my Christmas table. Don't let them do that to you."
1,Why you should support Public Schools,"The point everyone seems to be missing is who cares if France is or never has been our best buddy. France is an independent nation that has its own Foreign Policy or have we become so arrogant that we have forgotten that. Can you imaging the reaction if the situation was reversed. Neo Conservative and Neo Liberals make me sick with the notion that they have just discovered France's role in affecting our foreign policy, anyone with half a brain knew this. Guess what, based upon the logic used in this book Britain really isn't our friend either, Revolutionary War, War of 1812, support for the South in the Civil War, closed blockade of Europe that restricted American Trade do you want me to continue, there is some news for yeah all. Just another attempted to sell an over-hyped book."
1,Garbage,"It's amazing that a university such as Seton Hall would have Mark Molesky on its staff. This book is nonsense. It's filled with half-truths and inaccuracies. Only the truly ignorant or weak-minded would fall for the stories in this book.France is an ally of the US. As in all relationships, there are good times and bad times. Criticism of policies should not be an excuse to abandon your allies. Unfortunately, because of the Bush administation's stance on the Iraq quagmire, Americans have been duped into thinking that French criticism was wrong.Don't bother buying or reading this book."
1,This is a Wretched Book,"John J. Miller and Mark Molesky have written a wretched book, filled with distortions, and with important omissions when the facts would not have supported their theme. This theme seems to be that no country can be counted our ally unless it is ""easy to control"", an astonishing concept. This screed will only appeal to people who hate the French already and who do not want to be bothered by studying the history of our relationship with France in all its complexity."
1,Unbelievably inane waste of time ....,"Reading this book caused me to pause frequently and wonder how anyone could commit such haf-truth, historically misinterpreted and totally uninformed nonsense into a book.At several moments in the book, the authors actually seem to posit that the French state has as its single motivating factor the absolute destruction of the United States. This is simply neo-con propagandist culture war mongering conjured up by agenda driven authors.I am continually embarassed how readily some people will forgo intelligent discouse and cultural understanding simply to jump on the rightist anti-France bandwagon of late.Instead of wasting time reading this garbage, how about jumping on a plane and visiting France? 77-million people did just that last year ... 25 million more that the next most visited country (Spain) and approximately 3 times the population of Canada.And, incidentally, France also enjoys the highest standard of living in the world."
5,A great book for history enthusiasts,"Buy this book. It will inform anyone interested in American-French relations why the current Bush Administration's distrust of French leadership is in line with the feeling of previous American presidents: Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Monroe, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Truman, Reagan and George H. W. Bush."
2,you stupid fools!!!,"okay history geniuses, where did we get the statue of liberty? yeah, bozos, it was the FRENCH! It was a friggin' PRESENT, from ally to ally! yes, they have cowed to Nazis and what have you, but it was never about opposing America. The idiots who wrote this claim they acted out of ""self-interest."" oh heck, and America NEVER acts out of self interest, right idiots? god you are all so stupid!! And who helped us in the revolutionary war and was our ally during that time? THE FRENCH, you fools! I won't claim that we haven't had problems with each other, but I would say that our oldest enemy is really our own bigotry, divisiviness, and internal problems. Fix that before you tell the French what to do!! peace out! America should be the focus of our analysis, not other countries!"
1,the superior French,"Americans know that the French feel superior to them culturally and that there is nothing they can do about it but whine. **Our Oldest Enemy** is the latest example of that whining.En realite, les Americains ont le sentiment d'etre inferieurs et ils ne peuvent pas accepter l'idee qu'ils ne sont pas universellement admires. C'est un exemple de l'adolescence culturelle Americaine.William Plank, PhDProfessor of French"
1,Claptrap and lies,"It never fails to amaze me what a publisher will do for a buck. Certainly, the US and France have had their ups and downs, just like the US and England, the US and Japan, Russia, Viet Nam, Panama, Iraq, and nearly every other country that the US has had dealings with over the years. But to say that the French are the ""oldest enemy"" of the country is simply false.Saying that France refused to assist its ally in the war on terror is not only a lie but a blatant lie. In January 2002, it was French troops who were the first to join American troops in Afghanistan; even more of them are there today (August 2005), facing the same dangers and fighting the war on terror shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the international forces. The 1,800 French troops make France the second largest partner of the United States in Afghanistan after Germany. How often is *that* reported in American news media!?If Amazon had a No Stars rating, this book deserves it."
5,A refreshing look at history,"This book removes a lot of the glossy history of the relations between the United States and France. While every child learns in school about how Lafeyette helped us during the Revolutionary War, it was never mentioned to them that Lafayette diobeyed the King of France to come help the Colonials. Every bit of friendship shown by France has been accomplished by individual Frenchmen whereas credit has been taken by he country of France. This book is a reminder that France has always been our enemy and the only times that they feign friendship is when it is for France's self interest."
3,Only Good If You Attend One of Those Universities,"This book is only useful if you attend one of the universities where the questions where adapted from. The problems cover only basic electromagnetics, it does not cover advanced electromagnetic problems such as scattering (physical optics, geometric optics/geometric theory of diffraction,...), mode-matcing, and integral equations. This book only helped me to review statics. Do not buy this book unless you want a basic refresher on electromagnetics."
2,Irresponsible Author,"As a physicist, I've read several physics books published by professors from different countries. It's the first time and it will be the last time I ever buy books published by these Chinese authors; they appear to be quite irresponsible. I found a few ""Typo Errors ??"" and requested clarification from the authors and publisher. So far they never reply.It also appears that the authors do not quite understand the subjects well enough to come up with a sound solutions to the problems posed in the book. They seem to memorize formulas in physics rather than having a deep understanding like Dr. Richard Feyman or Dr. David Griffith .etc.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME MONEY TO WASTE."
1,no value - not 2000 questions,"the questions are so repetitive as to be the same 60% of the time. And not only do you get less than half the questions, their quality is dubious.I prefer the software from Whizlabs and urge you to try on-line question repositories instead of buying this CD.No value for money"
2,Doesn't prepare you for the actual exam,"Although I liked the learning mode, the questions on this CD are way too easy. I aced the exams (90s and up) on this CD but did not do nearly as well on the actual exam (I did pass). Do not get lulled into a false sense of security: the exam is MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.There are also annoying errors---the CD needs a little QA."
5,Best Piano Album in a long while!,"I decided to buy this CD after seeing the artist on the tv show ""so i married a princess"". I have to say this is one of the best CD's I have bought in awhile. The tracks Grace, Within, and Stella's theme are most definitely the best original songs I have heard in a very long time!If you are even wondering if you should buy this cd, DO IT!!!"
5,wow!,"This guy is amazing. The songs are played with passion and he is incredibly talented. It is somewhat reminiscent of Josh Groban or definitely of Lucia Micarelli's ""Music From a Farther Room"", but he has a style that is all his own. Every song is fabulous and they sound different from one another. The first selection is especially outstanding and he wrote it himself! This a CD you have to get and will enjoy forever!"
2,ECLECTIC LISTENING,A very good mix of gendres from classical to celtic. Great arrangements Homeward Bound with a Phil Coulter feel to it An album I like the more I listen to it.
