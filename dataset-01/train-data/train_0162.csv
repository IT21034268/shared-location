5,The best,Bought this product and it worked like magic. My doggie loves the beef! Her eyes cleared up in days. Buying from Amazon is the best value . . .I found it on Pet Food something or other and it was $31 more! And they wouldn't price match!!
5,Pet product,One of the times I orders Angels' Eyes it became lost in the mail. After contacting Amazon it was shipped over-night as promised at no charge to me. I was impressed with the quick follow-up. This is the only product I have found that helps eliminate the eye weeping that some dogs have.
2,Angel Eyes,Wasn't what I wanted. I was looking for a good price on the liquid Angel Eyes and this was the powder to put on the dog's food.
2,"Still using it, looking for ideas on how to get my dog to eat it","As so many others did, I bought this off the internet because of all the great reviews on it. My 15lb cocker is so darn picky about what she eats, she turns her nose up at the powdered stuff. I accidently got it on my finger and decided to taste it and can't blame her one bit. This stuff is GROSS! but, I know that dogs taste buds are not the same. I have tried canned dog food, beef broth, water, on the dry food, eggs, raw eggs, and... I'm thinking bout baby food next. She's been using it for about 4 days now and it's to where she sees the powder on it, she wont touch it. The smell over powers anything that is supposed to taste good and so does that bitter taste."
3,Ok,"The first time I used this product, it was wonderful and the tear stains went away on my maltese within a month and a half. After continued use of the product (over a year), the tear stains came back and now while you can see a little difference when using it, there are still very visible tear stains on my dog. This is not attributed to food/water/etc changes as I have continued my dogs on the same items."
3,Just a friendly warning,I work for a pet store and we recently had to pull these from our shelves because they haven't been okayed for sale in the US yet... I know they work great but just thought I'd put that information out there
5,It works!,I tried everything except surgery which might not work too. The vet said he would need to unclog his tear ducts. I tried everything on the internet that was cheaper than angel eyes and NOTHING worked. Finally I tried Angel Eyes. It was more costly so I saved it for last. It worked!! It took a long time though. Almost a month. I mix it with a little food because he eats dry food and live with another dog. He loves the taste so no problem there. No negative symptoms either. I give it to him now every 3 days and it saves me money and keeps his eyes clean. He was always so sickly looking with long dark drainage from his eyes. Now he looks much happier.
4,Angel Eyes Tear Stain ELiminator,"I have been using this product for years. I have three white dogs and would not want to live without it. It is so simple to use, just put on food and they eat it up. Great Product!!"
4,Angel Eyes,I use Angel Eyes Tear Stain Eliminator to keep the eyes of our Maltese white. It works very well and the dogs like the flavor.
5,Angel Eyes,"We have a Bichon whose eyes were stained very brown along with his mouth and paws. We were skeptical of this product but asked our vet and he recommended it. It is a miracle product! After 2 - 3 weeks almost all of the brown stains disappeared, and not just around his eyes but his mouth and paws too! The first couple of times we gave it to him, he did not want to eat his food. We found that if we layered the powder in between his dry food rather than sprinkling it on top he would eat it. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND ANGEL EYES, it is expensive, but it goes further than it appears to and we found it works very well!"
3,Your dog may not like it,"We got a 120 gr bottle of Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs for our 24 pound Cocker Spaniel. Our dog Simon normally eats dry food and would NOT eat if we sprinkled Angel Eyes on it. He KNEW we had ""tampered"" with his food. We would try to get creative by adding it to table scraps but again, no luck - not even steak! I would recommend you buy the smallest bottle first to see if your dog will tolerate the taste/smell before spending more money needlessly on a larger bottle. We have discontinued giving him the product. Does anyone out there have ideas on how to mask the taste for dogs who eat dry food?"
2,"Definitely doesn't get rid of the red ""tear"" marks",I have been using Angels' Eyes for about 6 months. My white chihuahua still has a definite red line beginning at her tear duct and running about 1/2 inch down her face. Does any product really eliminate this stain?
5,Can't wait to see the results!,"Heard great things from friends. From what I've learned it takes about 3 weeks to see results. I don't give my Maltese the full dose each day...only 1/2 but I've heard that this amount will still produce results. I mix it into her food and she seems to like the taste (she has beef flavor). Alexis has stained eyes, mouth, and paws from her saliva. Im changing her diet as well. I'll update again in 3 weeks!"
4,FAST DELIVERY BUT TERRIBLE SMELL,"FAST DELIVERY!!! GREAT PRODUCT,HOWEVER, MY DOGS DON'T LIKE THE SMELL OF IT BUT EVENTUALLY EAT THEIR FOOD."
1,This could kill your dog,"I gave this product to my dog twice and it made her break out into bad hives. I contacted Entirely pets, the shipper, and they would not give me back my money. All my dog used was 1/2 tsp.-She's 5 lbs. If you do order this product, don't order from them."
1,My vet says no to this product,"The Angel Eyes has been working great, but when I took my dog in for his annual check up and mentioned that I was using this product he said that he wouldn't recommend it as my dog could get an intolerence to some antibiotics."
1,Did Not Agree with my Dog,I ended up returning this item. It made our dog ( Bichon Frise ) vomit whenever we gave some to him on his food. Back it went to Amazon. Your results may be different.
1,My dog doesn't touch her food! :((,"I finally got the product but unfortunately my 1 year old maltese refuses to eat her food. The powder is extremely bitter and it doesn't have the best smell, so I guess it repels her. Unfortunately I wasn't able to see the results, I wish the makers of the product would have added some kind of flavor so the fussy little dogs would be able to eat it too."
1,"Very bad, my dog has severe gastritis","My dog had severe gastritis after I gave him Angels Eyes from Amazon, I had given him Angels Eyes for the last six months, I bought directly from Angels Eyes and everything was fine, I ordered the new bottle through Amazon, and the dog got very sick. I waited 1 week and repeated the 1/2 spoon dosage and again he got sick. I am returning this product to Amazon, there is something wrong with it, according to my vet."
5,it does the job,"It's important to remember that this is an antibiotic and follow cautions for taking antibiotics: use it enough to be sure you get rid of the infection, use it religiously to avoid building up resistance, don't use it too frequently. I found it best to give it to my dog straight, as opposed to on his food. He loved the taste, and that was the only way I could be sure he got the full dose. I didn't give it for 3 months as directed (seems way too long a period, and about a month got rid of it), nor did I phase out doses per directions, since you're not supposed to do that with antibiotics either. Just my experience..."
1,Don't Trust,I used this the first week and loved it I though it was great as it cleared my dogs eyes up but then a few days later the corner of my dogs eyes got hard like cement. I stopped using it and every day for a month I had to soak my poor dogs eyes because her hair around her eyes was super hard. and all I can think of if it made her hair hard as a rock where her tear stains were what is it doing to the inside of her body. It cannot be good.
2,P.U.!,"READ ENTIRE REVIEW! In Sept. of 2008 I wrote, ""I can't really write much of a review on whether the product works or not. It smells so bad I have to disguise it in something to get the dog to eat it. Usually try to get the powder into some cheese or meat in order for her to swallow it. Sprinkling it on the food is just a waste of food because she won't get near it. Maybe someone has a good tip on how to get it into the dog!"" Today, May 27, 2009, I have found that it still ""smells bad,"" but if I put 1/4 tsp or less twice a day it really works to keep eye stain away and she doesn't seem to mind the taste!!! SO, NOW, I GIVE IT A THUMBS UP!!!"
3,It works with work,"I've used this product on my Bichon puppy for about nine months. I have seen a significant decrease in staining, but it still continues. I groom him every day and wash the stains with ""Crystal Eye"" a mild shampoo. I also clip the stained hair when it gets long enough. He looks a lot better."
3,"does the trick, lil pricey though","I have used this product and it works (it had better for the price). Recently i started using Clear Tears--- <a href=""http://cleartearsonline.com"">Clear Tears</a>, it works just the same probably a little better but is not as expensive."
3,"Works on some dogs, not others","I've been using Angels' Eyes on my maltipoo for a year and it works great. I saw immediate results and was thrilled, as I that eye muck makes me queasy. Her coat, too, is beautiful! I receive comments constantly about how clean her eyes are. Then I got another white dog...it doesn't work on him! He's been taking Angels' Eyes since Nov.07 and his eyes are still dark and runny. Ugh! I keep hoping it will clear up, but so far, no luck."
5,White Face after using Angel Eyes!,I tried every product that anyone told me about trying to get rid of the stain on our white toy poodle. It only smeared it. I got the beef flavored and she would not eat it in anything I tried until I hit on grilled sausage. Only a very small piece cut up with five days of Angel Eyes in my Magic Bullet blender making about 2 tsp. of sausage/Angel Eyes per day. After about two weeks of using Angel Eyes I could tell a difference. Now it is only a nightmare remembered of the awful stains on the sides of her face. Our poodle's stains were the worse I had ever seen on a dog. Now everyone talks about how beautiful her face is. :) I am on my second bottle of Angel Eyes.
1,Dog Hates taste and very litte improvement.,"My Maltese is a great eater, but if this is in her food, she will not go near it. I ended up buying veg capsules, filling them with the product and giving capsule wrapped in cheese. After one month very very little change. I will not be buying again. I wish we had better luck, I was so hopeful. Just beware that it tastes very very bad to some dogs."
2,Made dog sick,"not sure what it was about this stuff, but when I put it in my dog's food she got sick."
4,Good buy!,The item came quickly & really works. I have been using this product for some time now & it really does help with the tear stains. The price is very good too!
5,Angels Eyes on Amazon.com!,"I hesitated buying this product because of the cost. However, I found a great price on Amazon.com and have been very pleased with the price and the results! I followed the directions and all the staining on my dog's face is gone. It was gone within a week or two, and I continued the dosage for a month after that as the instructions indicate. Very very happy! Highly recommend this product! Gone are Daisy's sad weepy eyes!"
3,Works great BUT,This product completely removes the stain if taken as directed. Once it is stopped the stains return. It comes in a powder and is hard to mask the taste and smell. One sniff or taste of it and my dog would not take it. Finally found Greenies Pill pockets that I put the powder in and she will take it in one bite. Wish it was made in a capsule so it would be easier to administer! I recommended this product to a grooming customer and their dog would not eat it's food either so it's not just my dog. I have not recommended this product to anymore of my customers because it is too expensive to waste if the dogs won't take it!
4,Angel Eyes,"Angle eyes is rather expensive but a product that works. We have been using it,as instructed, on our 15 pound white bichon. He had a very noticible tear drip from both eyes that was so severe people stared at them first not the whole cutsie dog.Since using it we are hooked on it and will continue buying it. A wonderful product!!"
1,Angels Eyes 10oz,I heard alot about this product so I tried it. About a hour after giving it to my dog he started licking his feet until they were really wet. He didn't like it in his food and wouldn't try it again later.
1,Made my dog sick,"My dog couldn't use it. She was sick for about the first 4 days I used it, so I had to stop. She does have medical issues so it probably wouldn't make other dogs ill. With antibiotics and eye drops, her stains cleared up anyway. Now I have a whole jar and can't use it."
1,Do you really want to dose your dog with this mysterious powder ?,"My fault for thinking the item was pads for wiping tear stains..Wrong !It's some mysterious powder without any product information .To compound the felony, the seller shipped it without any directions whatsoever.For that sort of stupidity Amazon should drop the seller.I don't know about you, but I had no interest in dosing my dog with some alien compound."
1,Sick people,Stopping dogs eyes from watering is cruel just so you can have a fashion accessory.This is the American solution for everything - take a pill.
4,Seems to be working,"We have used Angel's Eyes for a month. The label states that results will take 45-90 days to show up. There seems to be less new tear staining but it will take a while for the old staining to wash or wear away. Altogether, our dog's white fur seems to be whiter. He licks his paws and chews on the inside of his ""elbows"" and those areas are less pink."
4,It's okay...,This stuff works okay for my bulldog...only thing is I have to use alot of it because my dog weighs 50lbs. Not sure if I will be buying again..
5,Beautiful white face!!!,"I recently started using Angels Eyes for my 10 month old Maltese who had terrible red stains, and in just TWO days I saw a remarkable difference! I am serious! I was using different topical cleaners several times a day and nothing really helped. He loves the flavor (beef liver), I sprinkle Angle Eyes granules (scant 1/2 teaspoon, he weighs 8 1/2 lbs)over his dry food, then wet it with about 1/4 teaspoon of water so it sticks to his food. I no longer have to clean his eyes, just when he gets his weekly bath. I hesitated giving him something to injest but it is 100% beef liver with common antibiotic used for animals and humans. And it is not something you have to use forever or a long period of time, just a few months. I highly recommend this product for red stains!!!!!"
3,Angel Eyes failed the test,I have been using Angel Eyes for several months now on my two Bichons. Their eyes have not improved much. Maybe a little but to little to tell. For the cost of this product it's easier to go to the vet and get a prescription that will do the same thing. However the plus of this product is they like the taste and it's not a fight to get it down them.
5,Angel Eyes,My dog had brown/red stains around her eyes and mouth. I tried other products but this was the first one to completely eliminate these stains. I've recommended it to several family members whose dogs had the same problem and it solved the problem for them as well.
1,Angel eyes,item was fed as directed but after 1 week no change. Just putting saline eye drops worked better. eyes now have less tear stains.
3,works great for a while then my dog showed allergic to it.,"Works great for a while then my dog showed allergic to it. He developed redness around his eyes, so we stopped it."
5,It REALLY works!,Angel Eyes really works - although it took almost a month before results were evident. My little blonde Pomeranian's eyes were badly stained with tears and now he's almost completely free of any stains. I have cut back (after two months)to three times a week and it still seems to be working just fine.
5,angle eyes,I have a maltese named lilly and angle eyes works great on her tearstains. It keeps her looking tear stain free!
5,"I'm a professional groomer, and I've finally found a solution!","Amazing! This is the ONLY product I have ever seen that actually prevents tear stains! My poodle had a severe buildup of gunk around his eyes, and nothing had ever worked for more than a day or so. After using Angel Eyes for 2 weeks, he was noticeably better, and within a month he was completely clean. No wiping, just put it on your dog's food and wait for results! Plus it's all natural (just liver!) so I don't have to worry about affecting my dog's health.I'm a professional dog groomer, and I've tried dozens of products. Nothing has worked like Angel Eyes! I now recommend it to all my customers."
5,excellant product.,I have purchased angel eyes for my white powder puff chinese crested for a year now..it does exactly what it promises to do...his eyes and dirty whiskers are have have been good...it does take 3 to 4 weeks to see clear results but it wil!
5,My dogs beautiful Angle Eyes,"This product is fantastic! I have tried 3 or 4 other products, none of which worked, and finally found Angels Eyes on Amazon! My pure white miniature Schnauzer, Max, had that gooey, tear stained eye area and after using Angels Eyes for only a few weeks, the area is almost pure white again. My black and white miniature Schnauzer, Bogart, had discoloration around his mouth where his beard is white. This area is completely white now and looks so much better than before. I can't say enough good things about this product. How many times are we, as consumers, promised results which do not materialize. This product delivers. I find myself recommending it to strangers when they comment on how white my ""boys"" fur is. Thank you Angels Eyes!Linda from Denver"
5,angels' eyes,"Angels' Eyes really works. My little white ShihTzu looked like a racoon, his eye stains were so bad. He now, 3 months later looks like a baby white seal. Pure white fur under his eyes."
4,Appears to be working...,We have been using this stuff for a few weeks for our teacup Malti-poo and it appears to be working - her tear stains are pretty much gone. The only reason I wouldn't give it five stars is that it is not cheap....
4,Angel eyes,"My doxie/beagle eyes were tearing excessively. Now that I am using Angel Eyes, the tearing has decreased to about 25% tearing. I just add it to her food in the am/pm. I would recommend this to any one who's dog has this problem."
5,Great product!,"My dog has serious tear stain problem and it has helped tremendously! When she's not taking Angels' Eyes, her tears come back. I'm completely sold on this product, it's a miracle! Thank you!"
5,Double benefit,"I tried this product for my malti-poo with perpetual tear stains. Within two weeks her stains were visibly improved. My favorite thing about this product was the surprise benefit. Angel Eyes cured my dog's halitosis. She has always had terrible breath, even with regular dental hygiene. Just as her tear stains were clearing, we noticed that her bad breath had disappeared. I have no scientific evidence for this effect, just practical experience. Even if the product did not clear her stains, which it did, I would continue to buy it for the dental benefits!"
5,Best product!!!,I tried a bunch of different things for my poodle mix and this was the only product that had results. I've had no problems with it at all.
4,Worked w/ Maltese,"I was recommended this product for my indoor Maltese which stains a lot around his eyes. I've been giving him 1/2 tsp. per day (1/4 in the morning, 1/4 in the evening), and the differences was noticeable after one week. I used to bring my Maltese to the groomer every other week, and a month has passed w/o professional grooming, and he's not staining as much."
2,"Horrible, bitter taste","This product does work for tear stains for my Maltese. But I had noticed that he seemed reluctant to eat his food and wondered if it tasted bad. Last night, after several months of using Angels Eyes I finally dipped my finger in it and was horrified at how awful and bitter it tastes! I am ashamed now that I have been making my dog's only choice for nourishment to eat his food with this horrible tasting stuff on it. It tastes like the bitterest of medicines and I almost gagged and had to wash my mouth out several times to get the taste out. And this was from just a finger dipped in the tiniest bit of the stuff in water. I will continue to use the product but have ordered a capsule machine and will put it into capsules which I will then wrap in a Pill Pocket."
2,It didn't really work for me.,"I tried this product, but didn't really have success in removing the tear stains from my Maltese's eyes. Better products are on the market that really do work. The one that really did the job, was from another online store. It was purchased from Puritan's Pride, which basically sells vitamins, but also so much more. The product was eye cleaning pads. I used the pads for a total of about 3 weeks, and not only did it start working right away, it's been about 8 months now, and the stains have not come back. Amazon should think about selling such a great product."
5,Works Great,"This product works great, my dog's eyes cleared up in about two weeks and he didn't have any adverse reactions."
4,works beautifully,"Angel Eyes works beautifully. The new hair growth is stain free and as the old hair grows out and is trimmed you get this cute clean, stain free face!!! The only complaint I have about this product is that it is VERY pricey.Josie M"
1,Banned in Europe!,Angel Eyes was banned in Europe. This indicates all the reviews complaining about using an antibiotic for cosmetic reasons have some merit. I wouldn't use this product.
2,No luck,"I finished the bottle of angel eyes on my 6 month Cockapoo and had no luck. Her tear stains are still as bad as ever. She never had a problem with the taste though, just mixed it in with some wet food every night."
1,Unsafe,"I gave my 8 year old Maltese angel eyes, he became very sick vomiting, unable to eat lost a lot of weight, was in intensive care for 2 days. Came home still sick unable to eat, diagnosed with ileus from antibiotics. Exploratory surgery, ruptured bowel peritonitis, in critical condition. Completely healthy dog until I gave him angel eyes. What a mistake."
2,Made the dog sick,I bought this for our Shitzhu but unfortuntely it just caused her to stop eating and vomits bile. She continues to be her playful self so it did not affect her in any other way. It would have probably worked if it didn't make her sick but now I will have to stop using it. Good luck to everyone else.
4,Angel's eyes review,I found this product to be excellent for my shih tzu. Her eyes drain a lot and the stains on her face were really bad. After using the product I noticed a difference within a couple of weeks. Unfortunately if you stop using the product the problem returns but I now make it a point to keep it part of my feeding regime. She doesn't mind the taste either which is another plus.
5,Beautiful Face,"My sweet Bichon has the most beautiful face now that I have him on Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Remover. Not only is it a wonderful product that preforms as advertised, the price cannot be beat! I sprinkled the recommended amount for his size on his food daily until the staining had diminished. After four months, I am now able to cut down the dosage to four days each week. If you want your best friend to have a beautiful face without tear staining, you cannot go wrong with this product. I just wish I had known about it sooner!"
4,Angeleyes Works!,We've used Angelseyes for a month with our Bichon Friese. We are happy to note that the dark tear stains are already diminishing. She looks much better!
1,My dog won't eat his food if I put this on it.,"I was never able to get my dog to take it so I don't know if it works or not. I have tried every sneaky way I could think of, even concealing it in home made dog food that my dog loves, but he won't touch it if this stuff is in it."
5,This is an excellent product. It really works Bought from Amazon.Com,"Angel Eyes is a wonderful product, it really starts working right away. Its important that when you start using the product, you first clean the eyes and cut the red hair around the eye because the hair that is already red is not going to get white. All the new hair will grow in clean and stay clean, when you use the product.I have 4 maltese and it worked on all four of them. I bought this from Amazon.com."
2,He liked Angels Glow better,"After reading some reviews for Angels Eyes, I decided to try it. Bad decision. My shih-poo won't eat it when I mix it with yogurt like I did Angels Glow. Also, it doesn't say anything about cutting back on the dosage once the staining has stopped. I was only using the Glow every third day. It made a nice paste when mixed with yogurt that Harley would eat right off my finger. After reading more reviews, I'm going to order Tylan Powder (it's the main ingredient in both) and try it."
4,Angels' Eyes for Dogs 240 Gram,"We've been using this product for about 1 month now and it does seem to help. My dog's stain is reduced a lot since using this product. We've ordered the 240 Gram and the bottle seems to be half full. Since we didn't have anything to weight it, we weren't sure if it is really 240 Gram. Other than that, I would recommend this product."
3,Angel Eyes works but How Do I get my Cat to Eat It,"I will give 5 stars if my cat would eat this. I tried things like putting it on cheese, yogurt, dry food, can food - what else can I try. She is a pretty white cat but with the dark stains it is very appealing."
4,"Angels, Eyes","Angles' Eyes is a good product that works well for my dog, and reasonably priced. Would recommend to other Bischon owners."
5,excellent product!!!,This product is incredible! My groomer recommended it and it works ! I will recommend it to all my friends who have white dogs.
3,"Good price, but m y dog prefers chicken",Amazon had the best price online so I was happy about that. I bought the beef because it was cheaper than the chicken but it turns out my dog prefers the taste of the chicken. My dog refuses to eat his food with the beef angel eyes on it until he is absoltely starving.The product does work well and after about 2 weeks I could notice a great difference in his tear stains.
5,Great product,Have been using Angel's eyes for several years with great results. It is wonderful to find it at such a great price.
2,Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Remover for Dogs,"This product works if you can get your dog to eat it. It tastes absolutely horrible (I know because I tasted it) and no matter how much I tried to disguise the taste with special dog food, peanut butter, whatever, I couldn't get my dog to take it more than once."
1,Angel Eyes??????,"First bottle worked great and kept my dog from staining, but none of the others I bought made a difference. I have completely stopped using this product on my dog."
2,angel eye dog stain remover,My dog Toffee hates the taste of the beef flavor angel stain remover however has reduce discharge by about half.
2,"Messy, too much work for no results",Too much work and messy. It did not seem to work on my dog. Tears still yellow. Good luck with this item
5,Angel Eyes Angel of a Product,"After using a myriad of products on our two Havanese dogs with poor results, Angel Eyes is is a winner. Within a week both dogs white hair is as white as snow!"
5,wonderful eyes,"My dog usually has this ugly brown stain running down her eyes. Since using Angel eyes, no more stain is noted. Great stuff. I highly recommend this."
4,it works!,"I have a Lhasa who's face was always stained from the brown discharge from his eyes. I have been using this product for just under a month and his face is much better. I am very pleased. FYI--don't buy this at the pet store, it is $30 for the same size that Amazon sells for $12. Drawback: you have to use it for three months every day until you can cut back to several times a week, so it can get pricey."
4,Really does work...,"My little poodle had very bad tear stain. Our Vet said it was caused by her diet . By adding ""Angel Eyes "" to her food daily, she now has none. She does not like the flavor and really does not want to eat her food with it on there. I wish the flavor was more to her liking. That is the only thing would would make it 5 star to me."
2,No all that effective,After a month not much change. Nasty smelling powder. Our dog did not like the food with this powder on it.
3,Angels' Eyes,"I have been using Angels' Eyes for several years now. It is very easy to use, as you just add to their food. I must say though, it does not keep all the tear stains from my dog's eyes. I'm sure it cuts down the amount, but I still have to clean her eyes with tear stain remover, almost every day. I may even stop using it when the bottle I have now, is gone. I'm sorry I can't give it a better recommendation, but I'm just explaining how it works on my dog."
3,Bottle smaller then other 120gram bottle already have!,"I absolutely love this product. This is the only product that works on my Malti-Poo's tear stains. However when I received the 120gram bottle and I compared it to a 120gram bottle I already had, the new bottle was smaller. I don't want to send it back and get charged for shipping, however I am disappointed and I wish there was an email or phone number I can call to ask them why the bottle is smaller."
1,Makes my Dogs sick,Very expensive tratment that made my dogs (Shih Tzu) very sick to their stomachs. Tried the plain yoghurt----worked great and it was cheap and natural.
2,THIS IS AN ANTIBIOTIC!,"As a veterinarian, I just want everyone to realize that this product is an antibiotic, and it is not a good idea to have your pet on an antibiotic long-term, without a medical reason. Antibiotic resistance is a big problem in our world, and this product definitely contributes to the problem. I can't believe this product is allowed to be sold as an over the counter product to the general public! Antibiotics are prescription items for a reason. Also, it is exhorbitantly expensive, and if you want your pet to be on an antibiotic to be stain-free, then you should talk to your veterinarian, for tetracyclines that are cheaper and work just as well."
5,Angel Eyes,I have used this product for over 2 years now and find it helps keep the eyes and mouth of both of our Maltese dogs cleaner than any other product on the market. I would recommend it to anyone that has a white or light colored cat or dog. The price is right on Amazon!
3,It was working but caused my dog to have an infection,"This product seemed like it was starting to work; however, I had to take my dog to the vet due to hives. While there they discovered that she had an infection. In talking with the vet I mentioned that I was giving her this product and he said to immediately stop giving it to her. There apparently is an ingredient in the product that can cause problems. They are linking her hives and her infection to Angel Eyes. I stopped giving it to her and her hives cleared up. She is taking an antibiotic for the infection, which appears to be clearing up. I recommend talking to you vet before giving this product to your animal."
5,I Was a Skeptic but Angels Eyes Actually Works,"I received my adorable Cock-A-Poo when he was 2 years old. He was adorable except for those ugly stains under his eyes. I found an ad about Angels Eyes on the internet, found that it was not harmful, and ordered some. It took about 3 to 4 weeks to clear the stains, and what a difference! I ran out once and the stains came back. I won't run out again. I did feel that the larger 240 Gram Bottle seemed to have less than the amount in it than I was expecting. I had been using the 120 Gram bottles and the 240 just didn't seem like it had twice the amount by any means. I don't know if that was a fact or just the way it appeared to me."
2,did not receive anything,I have not received my item that I paid AMAZON. COM for over a month agoWILL YOU PLEASE REFUND MY CREDIT CARD FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF MONIES...
5,Angel Eyes works great!,Have worked in the Veterinary industry for 15 years & have never found a product that works. Rescued a Bichon Frise with bad tear staining & less than a month later we are seeing fantastic results. Would definitely recommend this product.
4,Angel Eyes Tear Stain Eliminator,Angel eyes has helped the staining on our dog (who is completely white). The stained fur is still there but much lighter. We're having the groomer cut all of the stained fur out in two weeks when we go. We aren't seeing any new colored drainage. We've used this product for a month now and are about to order more. Would recommend this product. Very easy to use. Dog doesn't mind the taste of it on his egg.
2,Angel Eyes Disappointed,I tried the 120 gram bottle of Angel Eyes for my two white dogs and continued to use it until it was gone. Neither of the dogs liked the taste of it in their food even though I camoflaged it and I had a real battle getting them to eat. Also the problem with their eyes has not cleared up as anticipated. As a result I was very disappointed especially since the product is not cheap.
2,Too soon yet,"My puppy has been taking it for 2 weeks, and so far, nothing is working in reference to his eyes draining a dark orange."
5,Angels Eyes Really works!,"I have been using Angels Eyes with my Miniature Schnauzers. I have seen a huge difference in their eyes and beards staining. They are going on 8 years old and I have always feed them the best food products and only distilled water. Yet,still had problems with the brown staining until I bought this product. I am a groomer and I feel very comfortable recommending this product to my customers for their dogs as well. I also foster for a rescue group which is mostly Bichons and I have started them on Angels Eyes as well. They are usually in very poor condition when we get them and this is helping with the process of reconditioning their coats. I like to start fresh with badly matted and staind coats so I shave them down and as their hair comes in it is bright white and beautiful."
5,Amazing!,"I have bulldogs and they are known for their tear stains. A few years ago a trainer recommended this to me and i would buy it from a small pet store at a crazy price. It works amazingly well for my dogs! In the past i had tried a diet change and i give my dogs filtered water but their tear stains were still coming, i love this product, its not cheap but some things are worth paying for! I even recommended it my pizza delivery person when they saw one of my bullies eyes and asked how i kept them so clean!"
4,1 Week of using Angels Eyes,"I was able to use this product for one week before my bigger dog found the bottle, chewed it open, and licked it all up. However, in that one week of using the product, I noticed my malti-poo, BeBe's, eyes had began to clear up. I clipped all the reddish brown hair off around her eyes and for a couple of weeks after I had to stop her treatment, it didn't come back. She does have reddish brown stains on her paws, mouth, and anywhere else that her saliva touches so I am ordering some more to truly see if this product works for all areas. She doesn't like the taste but she'll eat it with encouragement, so that's a bit of a struggle, but she eventually eats it all through the course of the day with a couple of tries. I'm going to try to mix it into wet food to see if she likes it better. I believe this product works, I just need a more consistent treatment to test it out, this is why I didn't give it a full score."
5,Beef is the best,"I have used Angels' Eyes since getting my Maltese last April. I experimented with the chicken flavor and the sweet potato flavor. The chicken worked but not as well as the beef. The sweet potato did not work at all and now I am back to the beginning with her eye stains. I was very unhappy about this and wrote to the company twice and received absolutely no response. So, even though they make a good product in the beef flavor of Angels' Eyes, their customer service is pretty much nonexistent. Thank goodness for the customer service of Amazon. They always come through - others could learn from them!"
3,Buy a small bottle at first!,"We tried the beef flavored Angel Eyes without success. Our dog just didn't like the flavor. First we sprinkled it on his food, but that only worked once and he started to refuse it. Then we tired the suggestion on the [...] website of mixing the Angel Eyes in yogurt and we added some of his favorite freeze-dried beef liver treat to make it more palatable. That only worked for a couple of days and he wouldn't take it at all. We switched to the chicken flavored Angel Eyes and he LOVES it in yogurt. The product works pretty well, but I would suggest buying the smallest size available to see if your dog likes the flavor.The active ingredient in Angel Eyes is tylosin, which is a macrolide antibiotic in the erythromycin family. Some might understandably be concerned about giving their dog an antibiotic, but plenty of human teenagers take antibiotics daily for their complexion..."
5,angel eyes,"This product really does work as advertised. I have two Bichon's and both dogs eyes stop tearing and the brown disappeared around the eyes and where they lick themselves. Well worth the $. Best thing is as time progresses, you can use less and less of the product and it still continues to work"
3,Veterinary advice,"As a veterinairan, we have known for a long time that antibiotics help solve the problem of brown staining on the face. This is because the antibiotic changes the bacteria in the tears/tear ducts that cause the tears to be pigmented. This problem of 'epiphora' or tearing is strictly one of cosmetics..in other words, it isn't a medical problem but a normal condition in many breeds and it does not require treatment. I don't know if this product is available in Canada as, in many cases, our regulations on distribution of antibiotics are tighter. I would certainly recommend consulting your veterinarian before using this product though it is likely not dangerous for most dogs."
3,Angel Eyes for Dogs - Half full?,"I ordered Angel Eyes in the 240 gram size. The bottle came half full. When I called the provider, they said I was welcome to weigh the product. Seriously, do any of you have scales that weigh in grams. I am feeling rather at the mercy of the explanation that the extra space was intentional so that the product could be ""Well Shaken"". The bottle said nothing about coming ""Half-full"" so nothing on the packaging will help you feel better if you receive the same.Is someone skimming product? At the application rate the bottle did suggest, it is not lasting anywhere near as long as the advertising suggests; it appears as if it will last about half the suggested timeframe, which would indicate the bottle was only half full from ""skimming"".The product itself has worked very well and our Dog's eye stains, and the horrific stink, have been cured VERY WELL."
5,I see a difference w/Angels Eyes,"I have been using this product for over a month on my Shih Tsu/Bishon Mix 1 year old dog. I see a remarkable difference in his eyes, and am pleased with the outcome. I mix it into his food, and he doesn't seem to notice it. I will continue using this product!"
5,Angels' Eyes - Beef flavor,The 'beef' flavor Angels' Eyes is doing a good job eliminating the brown tear stains from my pet's eyes. I tried the 'chicken' flavor and found that it did not do as good a job. Though a friend that has used both flavors told me that they both are doing a good job on their pet's tear stains.
4,Angels Eyes Tear Stain Remover,"This is the only product that has actually removed my dogs' tear stains. Once use is discontinued, the stains return. Treatment takes months. I would rather use this product in pill form. A little expensive. There are 3 flavors; chicken, sweet potato, liver. My dogs will not eat the liver flavor. Sometimes the vendors do not offer information regarding the flavor they are offering. I can only buy from vendors who offer a choice of flavors. I have not found another product that works for me."
1,Caution!,"This product made my Havanese very ill! After following the directions, my dog became very sick after a few days with severe diarrhea and dehydration. My vet said the low dose erythromycin like compound in this stuff had destroyed the natural flora in the intestinal tract. Even with medication and further testing, my dog is still sick two months later and it mimics inflammatory bowel disease. My dogs is seven years old and has never been sick a day in his life until I gave him this stuff. Now, I just hope he recovers. The manufacturers of OTC pet products do not need to fully disclose that their products contain antibiotics. Use CAUTION!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"I have been using Angels Eyes for years and this shipment was unlike any I have ever used. It was very grainy, the dog refused to eat it and of course it has not solved the problem of eye stains.This is used for a show dog and I have stopped using the product as I do not think it has the same ingredients in it that I found in the original product brought directly from the company. I was more than disappointed by the product I received, but my main concern is what harm it might cause my dog.I will not buy this product again from this seller."
1,Angel Eyes,"I tried giving Angel Eyes to my dog - but had very little success, she does not like to eat her food when I sprinke this stuff on it (we even tried putting a little chicken stock in with the food). Adding it to water was even worse. I really don't know if this product works or not; therefore I gave it 1 star. For my dog a pill would work and until it comes in pill form, I have a full bottle of Angel Eyes and will not be purchasing any more unless they have it in pill form."
5,Love this product!! It Works!,Angels' eyes really works. I have a Maltese puppy who had a bad tearing stains. I cut the stained hair away. Within a couple of weeks no more stains. I have recommended it to others who have had the same problem.
5,"Works great, but made my dog sick UPDATE 1/15/2013","This product does work very well, that is why I was disappointed when my dog started vomiting after two weeks of using this stuff. I guess his system could not digest it. His vomit was filled with this stuff. When he first started vomiting I stopped giving him Angel's Eyes and the vomiting stopped. I gave him Angel's Eyes again and after a few days he started vomiting again. It is too bad it makes him sick, because it works very well. UPDATE: He was allergic to the beef variety. Angel's Eyes suggested I try the chicken variety, which was not listed on their website at the time. He is fine on the chicken, and we continue to use it whenever he starts getting tear stains. Fortunately, we have not had to use it that often, maybe twice a year for several months at a time."
1,Yellow teeth!,"I have two Cavachon puppies that had tear stains. The breeder recommended ""Angel Eyes"". I purchased ""Angel Eyes"" and started giving it to my puppies then decided to do some research. I try to use natural remedies in all aspects of my life. Researching the ""Angel Eyes"" I found that if given to puppies before they're adult teeth are in, it can turn their teeth yellow. I stopped immediately and started putting lemon juice in their water (it supposedly changes their system to a more acidic one which kills the yeast in the eye excretions), they liked it and within three weeks, no more tear stains. Since then I've started giving them each 300ml of organic cranberry juice mixed with enough unsweetened apple juice to make palitable, they love it and it does the trick."
5,ANGELS' EYES WORKS! My white dog is ALL WHITE now.,"Having a Peke-A-Tese, my Nigel was plagued with red around his eyes, beard and feet. The dog's saliva and tears is what causes the staining. We had been using Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for about six months and all red had disappeared completely. Worked like a miracle. He was pure white as he should be...but we have been over 6 months now without using it and the red has come back. So we are back on a maintenance program with him. Angel's Eyes is a powder and since we feed our dog dry food I use Greenies Pill Pockets to mix the powder in. Nigel then eats small pieces that I break off as a treat. This stuff works really well. Word to the wise: Don't get the powder in your mouth. It won't hurt you, the main ingredient is beef liver, it just taste very bitter. Great product and Amazon had the best price online!"
5,This really works -- worth the cost,"We have a 1 1/2 year old Havanese who is about 10 lbs and almost all white. We tried everything to get rid of his really bad tear staining: changing his water sources, different types of food, solutions from our vet center, topical solutions, etc. Nothing worked very well. Angel Eyes is the only thing that worked almost 100% effectively. It took just a day for us to start seeing a reduction in tear staining, although it took several months before his face went from brown to almost completely white. Relative to how bad his face was, we'd say it is >98% effective with just a little staining left. And he loves the flavor added to his food. Highly recommended."
5,Angel Eyes,This product works great (if you can remember to use it)! Luigi the yorkie has had excellent results.
5,Angel Eyes for Dogs,"This product works just like it says. I use it on my Maltese and Bichon and they look so much better without those nasty eye stains. I just mix it in their food once a day. So much easier than trying to fight them to clean the nasty stuff off their eyes, which never seems to clean them anyway."
5,great Product,The product reallly works great but the company sent liver when I asked for chicken. Our dog does not like that flavor as well and it stains her chin area.
1,Waste of Money,"This product didn't work at all. I tried it on our miniature schnauzer and started it just after a grooming after all the eye gunk was removed. I used it as directed, but he still progressively accumulated brown gunk that adhered to the fur at the corner of his eyes. I had heard good things about this product but there was no apparent benefit for my dog."
3,Helps some,It does help some and after I figured to mess it with some bananas I do enjoy using it more now than I did with water.
4,Angel Eyes Doing the Job,I tried Angel Eyes for my dogs with very good luck. All seems to be responding and their eyes are showing improvement after only two weeks.
5,angel's eyes works great,"We have Maltese dogs and have always had a problem with the dark excretion around their eyes. Someone suggested this product to us, and we started using it as soon as it came. What a difference - we don't have to wipe their eyes every day. They look so much better."
2,Dog will not eat.,My Havanese would not touch it. I mixed it in with his old food as well as his new food. He didn't touch the stuff. I left it down for two days and he still wouldn't eat it. As soon as I dumped the bowel with Angel Eyes in it and put fresh food down without it he immediately devoured it.
5,only product that actually works,"This is the only product that I've tried that actually works to eliminate all tear stains from my white maltese dog. It works only if used consistently, but even a little goes a long way. I highly recommend use of this product."
4,Angel eyes good job,"I am very pleased with the Angel eyes. I noticed a little difference in six days. Later I started to notice a big difference around my dog's eyes. I have a toy Bischon, and she has always had a lot of problems with staining around her eyes and down the face. Angel eyes seems to be taking care of this problem. I rated the purchase a four star because the bottle was half full. I contacted the seller and they stated the reason was because of change of the bottles. I think they should show some type of notation on the bottles are being sold."
3,no problem with seller.. just disappointed with the product,The product arrived in good condition but after a month of trying it out we have not seen a significant change in the tear stains on our white dog so we were disappointed.
2,"Works, hard to make your pets take it.","I have a maltese and a malti-poo, they are normally good eaters. Althought after a few days, they refused to drink the water bowl that contained angel eyes. We tried to put it in their food, but that failed as well. We gave these to a friend and had the same results."
1,Angel Eyes,Yikes! When I opened the bottle it had little bugsbursting out of it! I am glad I didn't feed itto my pet!
1,give this a try...,I have a 2 year old maltese that had the eye stains. I bought him stainless steel food and water bowls instead of the usual plastic dish. Afterwards I had him groomed to where his hair around his eyes were shaved. The new hair is all white and has been for over a year now. This has been the one thing that works for me. Try it.
1,Not Helpful - this is making my dogs eyes worse,I ordered the Chicken Flavor which costs an additional amount because my dog is allergic to beef. Unfortunately I was sent the beaf flavor. Very Disappointing!
1,Angels Eyes for tear stains in pets,"Angels' Eyes Tear-Stain Eliminator for Dogs, 120-Gram BottleI would not advise use of this product as it carries an antibiotic. Long term use of this can cause health problems in pets. Tylosin is an antibiotic in the Erythromycin family, it uses this as a titrater. I do not believe long term use of this product is healthy for your pets."
2,worth it?,"This product was taken off the shelfs at stores like petsmart for a reason. the powder material isnt da best way to get ""angel Eyes"" for ur dog it didnt fo me. i own two dogs and there both maltese it didnt work even after 2 months of trying! you better off cleanin them everyday.i dont recomend this product."
1,Don't Buy!!,"I rarely find it necessary to leave feedback, but I was so disappointed in this product I found it necessary to warn people against buying it. I gave the smallest amount to my yorkie and right away I noticed it dried up his eyes from tear secretions, great right? Well it also dried up his nose which is always, as it should be, wet. The next day I tried to feed my dog his food without Angel Eyes in it, and he ran away from me and hid! He would not go anywhere near his food bowl, which is absolutely not normal. After 24 hours he was back to normal, but I will never again poison his food for the sake of vanity!"
1,Not Good,This product was not in stock and dealer would not confirm it was not in stock but kept my charge for Angels eyes tear remover untill I contacted Amazon for refund. Do not deal with this vender.
3,Great Product bad shipping,I have been using this product for 6 months and its great. My dog no longer has stains. once the stains are gone you must continue to use the product as they will come back instantly. It took 15 days to get to my house and when it did the box was mangled and the bottle was bent.
1,Tylosin is a macrolide-class antibiotic. It can be dangerous.,Tear staining is a natural oxidizing process where the enzymes in the tears react with air and natural bacteria on the skin. This product contains a low dose antibiotic called Tylosin that disrupts this normal physiology. You are literally 'treating' your dog with a daily dose of antibiotic. It is not considered responsible use of antibiotics by many veterinarians. The safety of long term use of antibiotics like this have not been properly studied and are likely to cause long term effects. This is why many people have reported GI signs in the reviews. The best thing you can do to reduce tear staining is gently wipe the area with warm water every morning as well as routine grooming. If tear staining continues to be a major issue for you - DO NOT GET A WHITE DOG NEXT TIME.
5,Works well & dogs seem to like it,"We have 2 Bichon Frise dogs, 1 doesn't have the tear staining but the other does. We have tried tear stain wipes but doesn't seem to do anything. Angels' Eyes is the only product we have tried that works well. Last year we ran out of Angels' Eyes and because he looked so good we quit using it, however, the staining started right away and got really bad; put him back on Angel's Eyes, it cleared right up. We use both the beef & chicken flavor for a little ""gravy"" and they seem to like it, (they always eat the liquid 1st). Angels' Eyes seems expensive so we buy the biggest bottle I can find so it will last 6+ months. We order from Amazon and sometimes it comes from Amazon and sometimes from an outside supplier, so far our orders have always come quickly and usually arrive before their estimated delivery date. We highly recommend Angels' Eyes."
4,It seems to work.,"I bought it for my white Shih Tzu. I have to say that I see a difference, but it did take several weeks to work. He will not eat it sprinkled on food so I have to mix it in wet dog food."
4,Embracing the end of life,"Megory seeks to bring meaning to the end of life. She encourages the reader to make dying a sacred event. One way she creates this sacredness is with rituals. Megory includes in her book a wide range of Scripture, Sacred Texts, and Poetry to aid in creating this sacredness of space and participants. This is a good resource to have on the shelf when we have the opportunity to help others embrace the end of life."
4,Good Buy for the Money if You Need a Large One,"I was in all pleased with this purchase. I did find the instructions to be useless, and one plastic stake did come cracked so it broke when being installed. We did take the hint from another review, and bought and used the 6 pack mini colored electrical tape to color code once we got it up. Then we numbered on the tape with black permanent marker each step by number. It holds 4 large queen blow up mattresses for sleeping, but no foot room left. That gives you an idea of it's size. Will sleep 10 adults if no mattress, and we will be sleeping 5 adults and 4 children on mattresses. I will try and request a replacement stake for the one that was cracked. HAPPY CAMPING TO BUYERS OF THIS TENT!"
2,MEDAL IS HOLLOW!!!,"BE CAREFUL!!!!! This medal is hollow and SOUNDS hollow when it moves around on a necklace. I had no idea it was going to be hollow and almose puffy looking. Because it's a good looking medal, I still gave it as the gift I intended it to be, but I was a little embarrased. I will probably replace with another, medal that doesn't ""sound"" so cheap when worn..."
1,broke when i got it,When I recieved this item it had split apart and was broken. I was so mad I just threw it away!!!
3,Ok for the money,"The pendant is much shinier than the picture. I was under the impression that it looked a little worn, which I wanted. There is also something in the back which isn't mentioned on here. All in all it's ok, I was just hoping for something more ""metal like"" and this seems almost plastic. I still wear it so I guess I shouldn't gripe too much. It did arrive very quickly, which I appreciate. You get what you pay for... if I'd spent more money on it I would be pissed, I'll put it that way."
2,"Fun, but slow","This game looked extremley exciting on the cover, but it isn't all that great when you actually play it. You are unbelivabley slow and it'd hard to throw objects at other racers, because at the same time you're driving and you have to strain your fingers. I also don't like what happens when you quit the race, it is very confusing to figure out what you're doign and where you're going. Overall I would say this might not be the best game to buy."
1,This game is a huge letdown after CTR!,"This game is way to easy!!! I got it thinking it would be tough, challengeing, and fun like CTR(crash team raceing)! I mean it was like you just beat 3 little easy races and you are done with the whole level. and the boss of each level is even easyer than the level its self! trust me but CTR instead!"
3,Happy Couples...,"This book was OK. However, the premise is ""Happy Couples...."" There's a lot of common sense, and good examples. I have been married for 36 years, and I am still trying to figure out what ""love"" really is...as it relates to me, personally. I would like to experience the ""true devotion"" some couples seem to have for each other; i.e. the one that works both ways, and how to keep the ""sparks"" going after 60...."
4,"Good production, questionable thesis","This is a well produced, thought provoking documentary that raises important issues about our government, our civil liberties, and what we are willing to sacrifice for our perceived safety. The underlying thesis is that the political, paramilitary and military conditions in United States in 2008 were similar to the situation in pre World War II Germany and that if we do not change things we could head down the same path. I found this to be grossly simplistic and misleading in that it ignores the striking socio-economic and nationalistic conditions in post World War I Germany that provided a solid foundation for Hitler and the Nazi party and which simply do no exist to the extent of being prevalent in the United States. Nevertheless, the documentary is interesting and certainly worth seeing. Most liberals will enjoy it, most conservatives will despise it, but anyone who sees it will have something to say."
4,Just as timely now,"I really thought President Obama would substantially dismantle the Bush rush to what will may well end up as a right wing dictatorship, just as this movie portends. Hasn't happened. Not one bit. If not Mr. Obama, then whom? One thing's certain. Left to drift, with our politicians kicking almost every can down almost every road and all the decisions being made behind closed doors as faits accompli, we the people are left adrift and bereft. So we edge towards more disorganization, more fear and therefore a great chance of the end of our civilized, educated, democratic and functional society. As she said, this is not a ""Left vs. Right"" situation. This is about the fabric of culture itself. Scary stuff.My only criticism of the documentary is that there is perhaps too much stage time and not quite enough field work. But the points are well made nonetheless."
5,America Eyes Wide Open,"Very good film. It really uncovers all the dirt poured over Americans eyes. What was really astonishing was learning how history was repeating itself clear and simple. A bit scary,"
5,Great Film!,Read the book which was intriguing but the film really brings the issue into focus. Anyone that cares about the direction the country is headed should watch this film! Besides its powerful message it is also made very well mirroring an Inconvenient Truth. Great film.
4,This will get you thinking....,"Whether you agree/disagree with the message of this film, Naomi Wolf certainly makes an interesting comparison between post-9/11 America and pre-Nazi Germany. Wolf narrates a well-organized thesis broken down into 10 simple signs of a society being stripped of its freedoms. However extreme this comparison may seem to people, it is never safe for us to assume that our inalienable rights are automatically secure and immovable--they can be taken away from us if we are not careful to protect them. This film definitely worth seeing, if only to remind us of this fact alone."
2,Annoying flaws and inconsistencies,"Other reviewers mention small flaws and inconsistencies in the plot of this book and I am afraid, for me, they detracted from what was otherwise an interesting look at the hypocrisy of Victorian London. Unfortunately it is hard to point out these flaws without being a spoiler so suffice to say that the ending was not borne out by the behaviour of the characters throughout the book and I think that, even allowing for the mores of the time, there are elements of a nurse's job that would have required closer contact with the patient than Miss Latterly seemed to exercise."
2,Not My Favorite,"I am a devoted reader of Ms. Perry's Monk & Pitt novels; but I must say that this book is a far cry from her best. Her character development is usually spot on and the reader usually has a myriad of possible culprits from which to choose. However, this reader was left wondering if the author allowed her parlormaid to write the book as the ending was so implausibly and melodramatically far-fetched."
4,Speed and violence!,"The fastest racing game I've ever played and it has weapons, to boot! Was looking for a good racing game for the Cube, since they don't carry Gran Turismo, and ran across XGRA and Hot Wheels World Race. Played Hot Wheels once and then I put XGRA in...I haven't touched Hot Wheels since! This is one fast racer and the powerups for weapons and shielding, etc. add an element that makes this much more than just another racing game. Graphics and sound are both top-notch here - when your cycle hits mach-1, you really get the sensation your moving that fast. Good stuff!"
3,Just a few good songs,"Even with an album this short, there is quite a bit of filler. Still, Heather's flow can get real nice. The first two songs, ""Da Heartbreaka"" (ill) and ""All Glocks Down"" (underground classic) got my hopes up. Get it used."
5,Feedback on Omen 7 Extreme received from Amazon,"Before this, I had never received any defective items from Amazon. I ordered this one and I was really excited to get it but, the Push/Pull Coil Tap was broken so I requested for a replacement. The replacement arrived in 4 days. The replacement guitar's neck was bent more than usual. They had set the bridge too high so that the strings do not touch the frets. Overall I found it difficult to play with high strings. Although Omen 7 Extreme is a great sounding guitar, I a not happy with my replacement."
4,Liked the character...,"Liked the new character the Ms. McClellan has introduced, however, all this ambiguity regarding Shelby was tiresome. Several different places in the book referred to Shelby as 'she', then in another chapter, Shelby was 'he'. Also, Ms. McClellan should insist upon a new proof reader. There were passages that had to be read and reread to make sense. Overall, though, a very enjoyable story."
1,Distracting Errors.,"Impossible to to read due to all the the errors. Spelling, punctuation, logistics, you name it- it was wrong. Every single page had errors. Even the title character Lynne went back and forth from Lynne to Lynn. Sloppy and lazy editing made it way too difficult to concentrate on anything resembling a plot. Also, I have lived in Leadville for 18 years and the inconsistencies with what actually exist in Leadville were extremely annoying. My dog could've written a better book. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,Fast and Efficient but could be hotter,"This blower is okay but it seems to take me longer than when I had my old brand. If you have long, thick hair, this dryer is adequate! The high speed setting throws out more heat, as expected but I still wanted it hotter. The low speed setting is great for styling if it was warmer. I have never dried my hair with this brand before. It is also lightweight but rather noisy."
5,Great blow drier,My expensive Chi brand blow drier went out after only two years. After researching several blow driers I saw this one had great reviews so I decided to try it out since I didn't want to spend a lot of money on another blow drier. This drier is great. It dries quickly and blows really hot air. I'm very pleased with it and would recommend it to everyone.
5,Much better than old norelco dryer,"I was long overdue to upgrade. I have very thick, hair that I just dont want to cut short and this dryer makes it so easy to smooth out if I want to. I thought it had a lint filter though and I have not been able to find it. My old blow dryer finally died so off I finally got to buy a new one without feeling guilty. After some research, I picked this one and have not been disappointed."
4,grip design,"Hair dryer works good. Thant said, the design of the handle could use some improvement. It has a narrow handle. Periodically, I accidentally turn off the hair dryer because my finger accidentally squeezes the small toggle on-off switch on the handle. It is a little annoying, but tolerable"
2,dries fast but overheats,"my hair is shoulder length, layered and medium thick. My old dryer (Remington D-2012 Tstudio Collection Tourmaline and Ceramic Hair Dryer) took 5-10 minutes to dry my hair. This dryer took 5-7. But it overheated almost immediately and shut itself off. and it took a few minutes to cool so I could turn it back on and finish drying. There are no vents in the concentrator, either.Sure, it's light,but it feels flimsy.Also, the cord is incredibly short.I bought this two days ago, used it just this morning and I am returning it."
4,Cut my dry time by a third!,I have really thick hair and it usually takes a several minutes to dry. This dryer significantly cut my dry time. Lots of air movement and the ionic feature really works. I agree with one of the other reviewers who said the buttons were awkwardly placed (hence only four stars). There's something not at an optimum there. Maybe if the on/off and temperature buttons were put in reverse order or moved so you didn't accidentally click a button while you were using the dryer? The other suggestion would be to insulate the barrel. I like to hold it when drying the back and you can't on this dryer as it gets way too hot. Still I love this dryer and would purchase again.
1,Breaks easily,"If you just want a cheaper hair dryer, this one has power and works fine. But mine did break after a year, just stopped working electrically."
2,Didn't last 2 years,I chose to buy this hair dryer because of the great reviews and comparability to the T3. I didn't like how the hot setting was too hot and the warm setting was not hot enough. I've had this hair dryer for less than 2 years (purchased in May of 2011) and it just broke--it won't turn on anymore. I've had cheaper hair dryers last 10+ years! Would not purchase again. :/
3,Did not last long,Nice blow dryer while it lasted. I've had it less than 2 years and the fan bearing are going out. Sounds horrible. I'm disappointed that it didn't last longer.
5,awesome,"My favorite hair dry so far. I have noticed the difference when using this one compared to my old hair dryer, my hair isn't as frizzy and it does appear to have a little more shine, love the diffuser also"
3,not hot enough,"This dryer doesn't get as hot as my previous Revlon dryer. It gets hot, but only in the Hot & High setting, but not in the Hot & Low setting, which I would use for styling. It takes longer to dry my hair and I can't get it to look the same as it did with my previous dryer."
2,Mediocre-to-poor blowing speed,"The heat level is fine, but the highest wind or blowing speed feels like medium/light. As a male with medium-length hair, I don't see how someone could recommend this particular product (compared to the 10 other options out there at c. $20) to anyone with longer-than-short hair."
1,Only worked for a month,"This dryer completely stopped working after only 2 months after I purchased it, and I did not even use it daily. Wasted money."
3,Gets the job done,"I bought this dryer for its reasonable cost, good reviews and its claim to be relatively quiet. it is not as quiet as I had hoped but works well."
4,Nice product,"All in all it performs like it should. My only complaints would be that it doesn't seem like it has the amount of power I was expecting and the concentrator can get really hot. For the price, I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Good Item,I found this hair dryer was good.Buttons got in the way a bit when holding it as i kept turning it on and off to start with.Apart from that it was as good as i was expecting it to be.
1,Failed in Less Than a Year,"I purchased this blowdryer in November of last year and it just failed - it didn't even last a year and it shorted out! I thought it was great and lightweight while it worked, however I can't believe it didn't last longer than 9 months."
2,Disappointing,I prefer to dry my hair on the low setting and was disappointed to find that the low setting on this model wasn't low. Even with the diffuser it just didn't suit my needs.
3,It died,I may not have bought this from amazon so I cannot say how long I have owned it. It has not been used much so I was surprised that it stoped working.
1,Died!,"This is my first official review. I bought this dryer about 7 months ago. Other than the concentrator/nozzle melting a bit, it worked great. Seven months later it stopped working. I've never had a blow dryer die on me so quick! Would not buy again."
3,Good hair dryer - not long lasting though,"My previous dryer was over 10 years old and just wouldn't die. So even though it still worked, I bought this one based on the great reviews. And it was a great dryer while it lasted. Light to hold, dried my hair fast, not very loud. It's all but dead 2 years later. The wiring has split right up by the dryer and I have to spark it to make it run and then hold the cord in an exact position. I didn't let the cord get twisted, didn't wrap the cord and with short hair, it was gently used. I'm on here looking for a new dryer but it won't be this one."
4,lightweight but not as quiet as hoped,"Great value, lightweight, works with lots of power and has the necessary attachment, but is louder than I hoped. Diffuser snaps on very tight so no fear of falling off..."
2,Two and half years and it died,"I really liked this dryer -- quiet, fast-drying, lightweight -- until it died yesterday after owning it for less than two and half years. Perhaps my expectation are too high? I used this almost daily, but my hair dries in about 10 minutes, so I don't quite understand how that would wear it out so quickly. To be honest, other Revlon hair dryers haven't lasted too long for me, either, so I think this is the last Revlon hair dryer I'll purchase. I'm tired of replacing these things so frequently. (Will someone please make a hair dryer that lasts? I will pay extra for that!)This dryer gets two stars for the two years I owned it."
3,Position of on/off couldn't be worse! Keep shutting it off while in use!,"Like I say, above, the on/off switch is EXACTLY where my fingers grip the handle -- I can't say how many times I've accidentally turned off the dryer. Others have talked about how light it is -- it's okay, not superlight but not heavy. It functions okay -- when I haven't accidentally squeezed it off, LOL."
2,Died after 1 year. Worked well when alive.,This hair dryer worked great and was light weight when it worked. After 1 year though it started to blow at 25% power and eventually it just died completely. I've never had a hair dryer last just 1 year. Revlon needs to work on their product reliability.
2,Not for fine hair - I should have listened!,"Amidst the happy reviews there are just a few that mention that this might not be a good dryer for fine hair. Wish I'd listened! My fine, straight hair is normally no big deal to style but this dryer leaves it limp, limp, limp. Plenty of hair spray is the only way to salvage a little curl. And perhaps because my hair is both fine and short, the dryer runs too hot for me. Can't handle pain before breakfast. Glad it works well for so many folks but, for me, time to find another dryer. I strongly recommend the Elchim Professional 2001 2000 Watt Classic Hair Dryer, which is not ionic, works perfectly with my fine hair, and has proved worth the higher price."
3,I LIKE IT!,"IM NOT AN EXPERT ON HOW TO USE A DIFFUSER,BUT I PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT WITH A LOT MORE EXPECTATIONS. THE BLOW DRYER ITSELF IS VERY CUTE AND STYLISH.BUT I DO LIKE IT"
1,HORRIBLE,If you have straight hair that you actually do something with stay away from this dryer. I have short straight hair and this dryer is leave my hair flat and limp!!! I am definitely returning this dryer. I will take my chances with my old beloved CHI that has a short in it until my new one is comes.
5,Dryer,"This dryer was a great price and arrived on time in safe packaging. We haven't used it yet, so I'll get back on once I have more feedback."
2,Beware if going overseas,"I bought this lightweight hairdryer to take with me on a trip to England after reading the good reviews that it had. Once in the UK, I used it with a wall adapter. About half way through drying my hair, it became hotter, so I switched it to the lower setting. Suddenly I smelled hair burning, and in what seemed like an instant, I realized that my hair had been badly burnt, the natural bristled brush had burned on the ends, and there was lots of burned hair in it. I had to leave the hair dryer in UK as it wasn't worth it to try and fit it in my suitcase, but I would not trust this dryer, at least not to use in another country. I don't know if it simply can't be used with an adapter or if the dryer itself cannot be trusted. Has anyone else had a problem like this with it?"
3,Voulme attachment worthless,"This dryer works well and I like the temperature settings. However, the volumizer attachment is worthless, it's like rubbing a dinner plate on your head."
2,Not a good purchase,"I had a Conair Infiniti hair dryer that was not working so well anymore, so I replaced it with this Revlon hair dryer. I had high hopes for it based on the reviews, and I was looking forward to having a lighter-weight hair dryer. I have slightly wavy, thick hair that I blow dry straight. I used this hair dryer for 3 weeks and every time I did, it made my hair frizzy and dull. I was so disappointed. I have now replaced it with a Conair Infiniti Pro, and my hair looks great again. That hair dryer makes my hair straight, smooth, and shiny. I did give this Revlon hair dryer 2 stars for being lightweight. That was the only nice thing about it."
5,Best option available,"Over the course of many years we've gone through many different blow dryers. For a long time I scoffed at the idea of there being any difference for this thing called ionic, until I tried it. There is a very noticeable difference. It makes the air coming through the blow dryer much cleaner feeling. I know this may seem strange, but it works. It means that your hair dries faster with less static. This is all we buy anymore for replacements."
2,"Breaks with a year, poor warranty service","Purchased this product 14 months ago, and it broke this morning. Agree with the above reviews about its quality as a dryer, it had worked well, but now I'm hair dryer-less.Called up Helen of Troy, since it is still under a 2-year product warranty. However, to get a new dryer I'd need to ship in the old one, write a $5 check, and wait another 7-10 days processing time before they ship out. Plus, if they don't have the RV544 dryer in stock (which they can't tell you on the phone), they'll send you a different model, who knows which kind. (mailing address: 1 Helen of Troy Plaza; El Paso, TX 79912)Sp one way shipping fare, plus $5, plus 2+ weeks processing time does not equal a stellar reason to use the warranty, so I'm just purchasing a new one with my Amazon Prime account.Overall unfortunate customer service experience from Helen of Troy."
4,Revlon RV544,"I'm sure there are better dryers out there, but for the reasonable price, this is probably as good as you are going to do. Air flow is better than on most inexpensive dryers and it throws a fair amount of heat."
5,LOVE this hair dryer!,I have long thick hair and it takes a big cbunk of my time every morning to blow it dry. This hair dryer cut my drying time by approx. 40% - it's amazing. And the price is fantastic compared to other tourmaline dryers I've looked at. ($200 or $300 for a hair dryer? You've got to be kidding me!!) I highly recommend this product.
1,Great dryer...while it lasts,"I loved my dryer, it worked great on drying my hair while leaving it soft and shining. However, after 4 months of daily use it broke down on me. I know it's probably just the fuse, but I've had other dryers at a must lower quality rating that lasted for years. Thankfully I still have one of those old goodies as a back-up kicking around so I was at least able to finish drying my hair this morning. A ""good"" product like this from Revlon should prove to be of better quality; I'm very disappointed and will be looking to probably pay extra for something that will actually be good quality. While I would still recommend this type of hair dryer, I would not recommend this model to anyone."
3,"works fine, but I see no difference vs regular non-ionic dryer","I'm not really sure if any ionic dryers actually make a difference, but all I know is that this is just like a normal dryer, I see no difference in shine, softness or anything else. Having said that, its a good dryer, works fine, strong enough to straighten my hair (which is relatively curly)"
1,FIRE HAZARD almost caught hair on fire!!!,I have had this hair dryer for less than 6 months and today a coil inside started to catch on fire and spit out flames that almost caught my hair on fire! I plan to contact Revlon and voice my concern over their very dangerous appliance! Do not buy!!!
5,why spend more when Amazon offers Revlon hair dryers,"this is the third Revlon dryer I have purchased from Amazon, and I am still a big fan. I dont understand why people spend so much money on hairdryers, when the Revlon dryers have all the necessary components at a very reasonable price. They are lightweight, have the quick drying ionic aspect, dont burn your hair, and dont shut off all the time like some dryers do as they overheat often."
5,Great hair dryer!,"I just love my new hair dryer! It truly dries my hair in half the time, and leaves it in good condition. Which is saying a lot, since I'm an old white-haired lady."
1,Update - Great Value,"This dryer is great quality for the money. It does dry hair quicker than my old ion dryer and seems to be overall more gentle on the hair - less ""frying"" out of the hair even on the hot/high setting. This is really helpful for me because my young daughter has long thick hair. It is convenient to be able to get her hair dry as quickly as possible without damaging it. I have fine curly hair and it works great for me too - I use the concentrator for my roots first and the diffuser for all-over drying. The different choices of speed and heat settings are great including the cool shot. I'd recommend this dryer - it is so nice to get a good deal on a quality product.Update: July 31, 2011 - Well, unfortunately this dryer has stopped working. It started just cutting off and then actually set off a burst of sparks while I was holding it and smelled like a burnt heating element. I won't be using it anymore of course and will now work on getting a refund or replacement."
3,"It's powerful, that's for sure","This thing has power! The first time I used it, it tripped my bathroom's 15-amp circuit breaker that is shared with a 5-bulb light fixture with compact fluorescents. That never happened with my old dryer, a Vidal Sassoon QuietStyler 1875. I didn't experiment a lot because it's a long walk to the breaker box in the garage, but I assume the lower power setting wouldn't blow the breaker.I based my choice on users' reviews of this dryer. I wanted three features and got one of them.I wanted a light-weight dryer and it IS light.I wanted quiet. Several reviews said it was, but it is quite a bit louder than my old Sassoon.I wanted the fast-drying that several reviewers praised. I haven't timed it, but I don't sense that it dries my (thick, medium-length) hair faster than the old one."
1,BROKE AFTER 7 WEEKS,"I liked this hair dryer when I first got it. Worked well, although I didn't think the tourmaline made any difference.After using it twice a week for 7 weeks, it just stopped working. I tried the reset button -- nothing. I waited till the next day to try again, with the same results. I didn't drop it, I didn't get it wet. Nothing was done to it and yet it stopped dead.I called Revlon and was told I could return it to them for an exchange. However, as it cost me $18.99 when I purchased it last Nov., and it would cost me approx. $8 to return it and another $5 for them to return it to me, I didn't bother.I am extremely disappointed in this blowdryer and will never purchase anything from Revlon again. I guess this is just more junk made in China. I'm going back to my 25 year old Gillette dryer."
3,Good dryer but coating melts,"Dries very well but the coating on the casing gets sticky and rubs off. I have thin to normal hair and it may be too hot for thin hair because although the box advertises no friz, I am still getting some friz or it may be damaging my hair due to the hot heat. I will update when I am more sure of this. I was hoping for relaxed silky results, but have not had the pleasure as yet. Again, this may not be the best dryer for thin to normal hair."
4,Is good,"I love this staff .I heard is works ,I had use before ,Is cheaper ,good quality'you have to have it"
3,Not what expected,"I saw this model hair dryer at Target. I was trying to find a hairdryer that fit an attachment from an old hairdryer that broke. It fit perfectly on the sample (cord cut) model at Target, but they did not have any in stock. I searched for the model on Amazon and found what I thought was it. The attachment doesn't fit, so have no use for the dryer...it was pricey too for a travel hairdryer."
1,Very disappointed!!!,"I went out of my way to buy this one (not to mention a day on research I did to find a good diffuser) . I asked my realtive to buy it from US and ship it to UK. I bought a $55 adaptor and this diffuser blows off when I switched on. I have many other US hair tools (Remington , Conair etc) which worked perfectly on this adaptor so its definitely not adaptor problem. Well, I was hoping to use it everyday and I didn't get a chance to use it even once...very very disappointing!"
5,Best ever,"I was a doubter too about the ionic tourmaline technology but after recently getting a flat iron of that type that worked wonders, I thought I would try a dryer too. This dryer almost makes my flat iron unnecessary. It let me blow out my fine, curly/wavy hair so smoothly it looks like I had it done at the salon -- something I achieved only with great difficulty before at home. I agree with the other reviewers it does get a little hot, but keeping it on the warm or keeping the cool shot button on helps. I think the airflow is great, because it helps straighten your hair without as much pulling. I purchased it because I read that in a test it performed as well or better than $200-$300 models, so I think it's $30 well spent."
4,Revlon RV544 Dryer,"It is a good hair dryer. It wasn't like what people said that it blow really hot air. Both ""hot and warm"" air work great! My hair does have a better quality after using it."
2,Not So Great :-(,"Ok, do these people actually use the items before they put them on the market? The buttons are directly where your hand grabs the handle, so I'm constantly turning my dryer off in the middle of using it. Good grief."
5,quick dry!!!,I have long thick hair that would take 25-35 min with a difuser. Now with this dryer 5 MINUTES!wonderful dryer!!!!
5,Exactly as described,The product was exactly has described in the description and I would recommend this product as a general use blow dryer.
1,great until it quit 3 months later,"This hairdryer was great and did dry my thick hair quickly - until it quit only 3 months after purchase. Good basic design, lousy quality. Only buy it if you want a very short term solution."
3,It's ok for the money,It's not very powerful so takes a while to dry your hair ... I have flat irons that I use as well .. if I didn't then i would want a different hair dryer ... good as a basic dryer
3,switches flip off easily,"Dryer works fine, as others have said, but main problem with it is the switches are placed right where one's fingers naturally fall, causing it to switch off accidentally at least once every time I use it. The pressure required to switch it on/off is not too great, so it's easy to accidentally switch."
5,Fastest hairdryer ever!,"I had an 1875-watt hair dryer that I thought I liked, but when it finally died, I checked the reviews on Amazon and decided to get the Revlon 1875 Tourmaline Model RV544. I had no idea what I was missing in the past! It's so light, my arm and shoulder don't tire from holding it. And the best thing is it dries my hair in half the time it used to. It doesn't seem hotter; evidently it's just more forceful. I love it and would highly recommend it to all!"
5,Hairdryer,I live in humid FLA- and this hairdryer does the trick. Dries fast and efficiently. The cool shot button works quickly. It's also lightweight and quiet.
5,very nice!!!,I neeeded a new hair dryer badly (mine was probably 15 years ole). This is very nice and quite! I love the hot/warm air feature and the atttachments.
1,Heating mechanism stopped working after 3 months,"I purchased this hair dryer a little over 3 months ago and the heating element is already broken. It only blows cold air regardless of the heat setting that it is on. I purchased this hair dryer based on the positive reviews that it had received, and I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing a Revlon hair dryer again. I have an old Conair hair dryer that I have had for almost 10 years that still works like a charm."
2,Great! (For a year...),"My wife and I used this hair dryer daily for just over a year and we were pleased. Now it turns off unless I hold it a certain way, suggesting a wiring problem. Good while it lasted, but twenty bucks a year is a bit much for hot air. Will not buy again."
5,perfect for the price,"I needed to buy a new blow dryer but was low on cash. I just went on google and put out the question best blow dryer and this one came up and then of course the others for @$150 and then it told me I could get it at Walgreens for more or Amazon for like $19.00 and then I got it with free shipping, so what a deal!.It is lightweight, low sound and works really well. It does get really hot but I then just turn it down to the med level."
5,Love it!,I bought this hairdryer about 5 years ago and it died this morning. So I came to Amazon and was happy to see they still made it and I purchased a new one. I absolutely love it. My hair is not super thick but I do have a lot of it and dries my hair very quickly. I use it with the diffuser and my waves/curls come out looking great.
5,Aweseome Dryer!,"I've been using my old one for a while but my was this a big change! buying a new dryer, i didnt expect such a huge difference, but This hair dryer is almost heavenly compared to my old one. This dryer is considerably lighter, and works way faster, even with my thick hair."
4,Love it!!!,"Love this hairdryer!!! I did a lot of research on hairdryers, and I'm so pleased to have found this product. It's very lightweight, quiet, & dries my hair super quick. I wish it was a little more compact (for travel), but for everyday home use, it's absolutely perfect!"
5,Very nice hair dryer!,"I have curly hair in a wash and wear style, but wanted a dryer that would help me leave the house for meetings or church without looking and feeling damp. This one does the job beautifully. The diffuser affixes firmly to the nozzle and the diffuser nubs are large and long enough to keep the warm air the perfect distance from my curls. I can dry my roots gently without disturbing my set or creating frizz. A great dryer for the money. The attachment to concentrate hot air also works well when I want to blow my hair straight."
3,So-so,"This hair dryer is OK. It doesn't seem to get as hot as I would like. It is very light weight and I'm not sure if that's a good thing. It almost seems flimsy. But heck, for the price what can you exect. Here's my chief complaint about this product: the on/off and temperature toggle switches are on the INSIDE of the handle. What this means is that while you are drying your hair, you have to be VERY careful how you hold it or you will turn the dryer off. It happens at least a couple of times every time I dry my hair. It is most annoying."
3,Not for Fine Hair,"This dryer, while lightweight and easy to hold, blows too hard and fast on low speed, and too cool on hot setting. It's very difficult to get the right speed and heat setting for fine hair."
2,"light, but warm setting is too hot","I was looking for a new dryer and found this one. It is very light and not very loud. The diffuser is huge which can be bad if you travel a lot like me, or have limited storage space. The ionic part works well. My hair is less frizzy and have lot of natural curl so I usually have frizz when I blow dry my hair. Why I returned it was that it the 2 heat settings were not good for me. The ""warm"" was actually hot and the"" hot"" was way too hot for my fine delicate hair. Back to the drawing board."
4,"Great price, Good value",This product dries my hair much quicker than my previous hair dryer. The diffuser also works great and my hair does not feel dry.
5,BEST dryer I've tried and only $17.99 w/ free brush at BJ's Wholesale!,"I bought this dryer a few weeks agao at BJ's wholesale club for only $17.99. It came with a free anti-frizz ionic brush as well. After trying hair dryers by Chi, Conair, and Wahl, I was so fed up. All those dryers took a very long time to dry my shoulder-length naturally-wavy hair (over 15 minutes), and they left me with frizz and no shine. The Revlon is fantastic. It only took 8 minutes to completely dry my hair, and left me with smooth beautiful shine. Note: I normally use SunSilk hydrating shampoo and conditioner, and Lanza Strait Line Smoother Straightening Balm. The model number on the box says it is the RV-5242 (I think because they are including the free brush). The brush itself it the BEST snag-free static-free brush I have used in years. I HIGHLY recommend this dryer to everyone."
3,Not a quiet hair Dryer,"I was looking for a quiet hairdryer to replace my Conair 1875 watt dryer from walmart. I read the reviews here and most people were saying it is quiet or super quiet. After receiving the blow dryer, it just just was loud as my regular dryer. I was really dissappointed. I can't believe so many people give false reviews here. The decibel meter was very high compared to my original. Wasted $20. Oh well, worth a try, going to keep searching for a quiet affordable hair dryer."
1,didnt last very long,"Sadly, despite how great my hair looked after drying it using this hair drier, it burnt out just after one year of using it...and I have short hair!!"
2,NOT QUIET,The main reason I bought this was because it was advertised as being quiet. It IS NOT. It a decent normal noisy hair dryer.
4,Good,This item is good but not as great as all the reviews make it out to be. It does dry my girlfriends hair quicker than her old dryer and leaves it softer but its not any lighter or quieter which were the main reasons i purchased. All and all good enough but you can run down to the local Target and pick up something similar I'm sure.
3,Great dryer while it worked,"This is a great dryer while it works. Now, after 11 months of daily use, it no longer blows hot. I expect a hair dryer to last longer. Too bad. On the other hand, 11 months for $20.00 may be reasonable. Something to think about..."
3,Fine tho switches are easy to flip,"It's a fine basic hair dryer. Moderate weight, heats up quickly enough. I don't like the switches and their placement. It's easy to flip one of the switches while you are using the dryer, and the cold air button is awkwardly placed. Also, the attachments don't fit on very securely. I wouldn't repurchase but don't hate it."
3,It's Ok,"This hair dryer works fine. It doesn't get my hair dry faster or make it shinier than anything else on the market in the $20 range. Sometimes my hand hits the power level button by accident, which is a little annoying. There's nothing really wrong with it, but after all the high reviews I guess I expected it to be something special."
2,Loses Heat,"I have had my this blow dryer for about a year now. Though it started out strong, it now has lost the ability to heat up properly, thus leaving my hair frizzy. I have to again look for another blow dryer that is affordable and lasts. I have long thick hair."
5,Nice and light hair dryer,"I really like this hair dryer, I don't particularly style my hair with it, but it has those different positions, so it's really nice to use and very light. Very easy to use on a daily basis."
2,Died after three months,"This hairdryer was nice enough while it lasted. It was small and lighweight, and did a good job of drying my hair quickly and without frizz. But I bought it on January 10th of this year, and here it is April and it's already dead. If it had even lasted a year, it might have been worth the price...but three months? I'll never be buying one of these again."
4,Loves it!,"I have used this hair dryer twice since I received it yesterday. I honestly am amazed.I had been using a junky hair dryer for a long time, so I finally decided to invest in another one. I only regret that I didn't do this sooner!I cannot believe how smooth my hair is when I am done drying it. I have the volume minus the frizz, which I didn't even know was possible.I have long (a few inches past my shoulders) medium-thick hair, and it dries it in a decent amount of time.My only complaint is that is kind of heavy. My arm gets sore from holding it up too long.Otherwise, I highly recommend this hair-dryer! I'm glad I bought it :)"
4,hairdryer,"This is a really good, functional hair dryer. Bought it to replace an aging T3 that was much more expensive, but this Revlon dryer dries just as quickly and my hair is shinier. My personal observation is that all tourmaline dryers impart much more shine when new, but for me there is no chance I'll go back to the T3 price range as long as this Revlon product is on the market."
2,"Lightweight, but not enough heat","I bought this dryer based on the Amazon reviews I read. Although I am still using it as it is much lighter than my previous revlon dryer, I am not impressed. The on/off switch is located so that it at least 3 times per hair dry I am accidently shutting it off. Also, the hottest setting is not hot enough to adequately dry your hair (mine being thick) in a shorter time period. The only true good feature of this dryer is that it is lightweight."
3,What's the big deal?,"I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for this. I went back to my old Wally World cheapie. It didn't dry my thick hair any faster nor did it make it smoother. Seems like any other hair dryer to me and actually it dried slower for me. Go figure. I g ave it 3 stars because it did work, just not all super dooper like I had hoped."
2,Very loud,"To it's credit, this dryer is lightweight. The description of this item states it is ""super quiet;"" however, I found it to be quite loud on the high setting. Also, the diffuser attachment hurts my head. Someone needs to tell the folks at Revlon that the human head is spherical--not flat. Finally, the cold shot button takes several seconds before the air temperature drops; it's far quicker and simpler to just turn the dryer away from your hair to set the style. I am not able to see any increase in shine, luster, or smoothness from an ordinary hairdryer without Tourmaline or Ionic technology."
2,Yikes! Didn't work for me!,"After reading a lot of reviews here, I decided to try this dryer. I have a dryer that I love, but I thought I should try to find a back-up for the inevitable time when mine dies. The one I have is a vortex dryer(with a bell shaped end) that lifts the hair as it dries and is wonderful! Anyway, I can't find the same model, so I tried this Revlon model. Oh my...I have shoulder length color treated hair, kind of medium thickness and I ended up with a fuzzy mess! I gave up before it was quite dry and went back to my other dryer. I wish I would have had time to start over, but I would have been late for work. Ugh....hate a bad hair day. Another thing....the on/off switch is at a bad place. I kept turning it off as I was using it! My thumb kept hitting the switch. So....its not for me, but YMMV(your mileage may vary)."
1,It Lasted Less Than One Year,"I bought this hair dryer in January 2011 and put it in the trash can in October 2011. From the beginning, I wasn't thrilled with this dryer. The on-off power switch is poorly placed and/or poorly designed and it took some time before I quit accidentally turning the hair dryer off while drying my hair (which happened multiple times every time I used the hair dryer). This dryer has two heat settings. I soon discovered that use of the high heat resulted in my hand getting burned because there are screws in the handle that heat up and cannot be avoided. The only way to avoid getting burned is to use the lower heat setting. Then, less than nine months after I purchased this dryer, I threw it in the trash after the heating element went out altogether. Good riddance!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"I have frizzy, wavy hair that is difficult to manage. Recently I gota hair cut and couldn't believe how great the texture and manageability ofmy hair was. I bought a new hair dryer, having currently owned theRevlon 1875 without Tourmaline, put the concentrator attachementon, which I had lost, and tried and tried to get the same resultsas the hair dresser. I was frustrated. Finally, I tried using theNEW hair dryer, which was this one - Revlon 1875 Tourmaline - fantastic- it was like I had different hair or gone for some expensive hairtreatment. Not only does this dryer dry or hair fast, it makes the texture,the layers, etc. look great. Buy it today!"
4,So far so good for LONG hair.,I have very long straight hair. This dryer is lightweight and easy to manage. I would definitely recommend for long hair.
4,Works well,This dryer got better reviews and was less expensive than the one my stylist recommended so I bought it. I like it a lot except for the placement of the on/off switch on the handle. My only complaint is that it's easy to turn it off accidentally while using it.
5,The wife is pleased,"I'm happy if she is happy. She has long thick hair, and she feels this drier works well and quickly. I can't comment on how durable it is, but hopefully it will last a few years."
4,Works Great,This hairdryer drys really well. It has plenty of power to dry hair. It comes with a diffuser which is a bonus at this price point. The only con was that the buttons could be on the side.
3,"Power is lacking, my mini wall dryer had more power","Power is lacking, my mini wall dryer had more power. Overall it's just ok. Should have bought a wall unit instead."
4,Good Hair dryer,Bought to replace similar model that broke. Works great and good value. Would buy again. I recommend this hair dryer.
4,Not bad,"Without much hair drier experience, this drier does the job, cheaply, without much fuss. Buttons are accidentally hit, on occasion, as the only real downmark."
4,good value - worth the purchase,"I have a lot of hair, it dries it very quickly. Leaves it shinny and smooth. This is the second time I purchased this product, owned a previous version for 10 years. Definitely worth it."
5,Great dryer!,"Excellent product for the price! Fast drying, not too heavy, love the attachments for my curly hair. Try it now."
3,Okay,Didn't notice a difference in sound or drying time. It is lightweight which is much appreciated. Like that it comes with an attachment.
3,Lasted less than 2 years,"This is a pretty good hair dryer. However, I'm giving it 3 stars for cord not lasting for more than 2 years. I blow dry my hair about 3x/week. I am mindful not to coil it up or bend it when storing, however, with my less than average use, it has met my expectations."
3,Design Flaw,"This is basically a good dryer and certainly good enough for the low price; however, there is one design flaw that is a daily irritation. The placement of the on/off switch on the bottom of the inside of the handle results in the unintentional turning off of the dryer while in use. The dryer is lightweight and effective."
5,best hairdryer for the price,"This hairdryer was a steal for twenty bucks!! I definitely feel like I'm using a dryer worth a lot more. My *thick*, wavy hair dries much faster now than with previously owned dryers. All the settings work as expected, including the cool setting (a first for me - they seem to usually just be decoration with no real function.) I would purchase this again in a heartbeat."
1,NOT for Fine Hair - Tourmaline Revlon RV544,"After using this tourmaline dryer the first time, I thought I had forgotten to rinse out my conditioner.The second and third time using the dryer, I suspected my flat lifeless hair was due to the tourmaline dryer (which it was).There were other reviews saying this dryer is not for fine hair, and I should have listened. When I realized it was the tourmaline-type dryer making my hair flat and lifeless, I went to the store and bought a NON-tourmaline dryer and now my hair has its volume and bounce back."
4,"Overall, Good Hairdryer","This hairdryer is powerful and lightweight and does a good job drying my usually frizzy hair and making it relatively smooth. The only drawbacks are the noise (I bought it thinking it would be quieter than my old dryer-- not so, but about average for hair dryers), and the placement of the buttons (I keep hitting them by accident, but it's nothing I can't get used to). Overall, I would recommend this dryer, especially if you don't want to spend the money on a T3. I like the diffuser attachments that come with it as well. Also, keep in mind that the airflow is POWERFUL, so if you don't like getting blasted by a stream of air on the high setting, then this isn't for you. It would benefit from a medium setting."
3,Revlon tourmaline ionic hairdryer,Very disappointing-did not do any better than my plain-vanilla Conair dryer at minimizing frizzies or adding body to my hair.
3,Revlon RV544,i have diabetic neuropathy in my hands and this dryer is very hard to hold without hitting the buttons to change the settings. i think i will tape down the setting i want so it doesnt keep changing while i keep changing hands to dry my hair. it blows pretty decent and it is light. my hair is very dry and that is why i bought a new hair dryer with the ions but i havent noticed any difference yet. hair is still dry and i use all kinds of deep conditioners and still dry.
3,No longevity,"I bought this blowdryer in December of 2010. I used it about 2-3 times per week during that time period. I was using it last night and it shorted out. The fan just stopped running halfway through drying my hair. Fortunately I had an old blowdryer lying around so I was able to finish the job. However, in my opinion, a blowdryer that only last 10 months is not worth the purchase!!"
2,Power issue,"I used this dryer lightly for about 2 months (3-4 times per week, for 5-10 min at a time). It worked pretty well. But the first time I used it for over 15 minutes, it stopped working.After a quick internet search, it's apparent that this is a relatively common issue with this product. It's some kind of power/fuse issue, as the ""reset"" button on the plug keeps popping out. Now it only works on cool air/low air. I am positive I did nothing to trigger this (in the way of letting it get too hot, wet, using the wrong plug, etc.) Bummer!"
4,Love My New Hair Dryer!,"I blow dry my hair just about every other day and I hadnt purchased a new hair dryer in about 7 years (even though I used it all the time, I cannot think of the brand- I tossed it and now just cannot remember).I bought this because I was looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser and high temperature settings, I have very long hair and was just thinking about cutting drying time.I love the attachments, The dryer gets really hot and I can get my hair dry in about 5-8 minutes, rather than the 15 it was taking me before. Great quality dryer, especially for the price.Looks nice as well.I am very happy with my new hair dryer!"
2,The switch doesn't work well...,"The dryer looks good and feels light. However the second time I used it, the switch to turn it off stopped working. I had to unplug it to stop the dryer. I just think it doesn't have a good solid quality."
1,Unusably hot,"This hairdryer has 2 heat settings: (1) Too Hot, and (2) a setting I can only describe as Unsuitable For Hair But Handy For Paint Removal. If you want a good thumb workout, you can flash the cold shot button on an off in a vain attempt to prevent this thing from vaporizing the hair right off your head. Mainly my hair ends up hot and still wet, or frizzy from overheating.I threw the packaging away before I realized how awful it is, so I'm stuck with it. I am incredibly cheap, and yet my intention is to get rid of it and buy a new one next time I'm at Target. I hesitate to even give this thing to Goodwill, but maybe I'll do that instead of throwing it out. I'll be sure to attach a note saying ""not for use on human hair"", just to preserve my karma."
5,Best Hair Dryer,I've had this hair dryer for 5 years and it still works perfectly. Best hair dryer on the market hands down and the price is unbeatable. Also its great that its super lightweight; I don't get tired spending an hour blow drying my hair. Its been with me for five years already and it has traveled a lot but it still works as if I just bought it and it heats up very well. Definitely recommend!
4,I think it is ok,"I don't feel too much difference between this dryer and others, but I don't feel anything bad with it. It is a little heavey, but acceptable. I give 4 stars."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I've had this hair dryer for about a year. It started off working perfectly, i was surprised how powerful it was for such an inexpensive hair dryer, but i guess you really do get what you pay for...A few weeks after i started using it it started flickering between the high and the low setting without me touching any buttons. I didn't think much of it, but as time went on it got worse and worse. Now it wont stay on for a minute without flickering to the lower setting, and since no buttons were pushed i have to wait it out for it to come back on high. It takes me 40 minutes to blow dry my hair when it used to take 20. I am in the market for a new blow dryer, but i wont be buying this one again."
1,Broken bottom of it!!!,"I really doubt it's a new one or a second-hand thing, the plastic is really delicate to be broken and actually it's broken already! the bottom of of the dryer, where to input the air, it's broken totally and I can't believe why I pay money for this!!"
4,after ALOT of research......Love it!,"I searched and did ALOT of research before I purchased this hair dryer. There were so many high quality brands at very low prices, but this one stood out. Some of the other brands actually had reviews that said the other dryers ""caught on fire"". I was nervous about purchasing anything. However, I finally purchased this one, and so far, very good. Dries very fast, not heavy and my hair feels sooo smooth whenever I am done drying. Only been a month, but I am very happy with my purchase,"
2,revlon RV544 1975 Watt,"Was broken in 1,5 year...But it is really a lightweight. Also, enough power. So, if you do not mind to buy every 1,5 hair dryer - it is for you."
2,"Good on hair, but died after one year","I loved this hair dryer when I bought it -- didn't give me the frizz, dried quickly, my thick hair that's prone to frizz was more smooth -- much better than the Conair it replaced. However, I noticed the motor making a funny sound, first just on ""high"", but now on all speeds and temperatures, and it's not getting hot any more. I came here to buy another one, so I looked up my previous order, and it was only January 2011. Hair dryers shouldn't die that quickly. So thankfully I had the old Conair in another bathroom, and will use that until I figure out what to get next. I'd love to recommend it, but I consider a one-year failure rate too high."
4,"Lightweight, good value!","This product is a great value for the price. It has a sleek design. Comes with both attachments. VERY lightweight! The only issue I have with it are the placement of the buttons. I have, like some other reviewers, accidentally turned the dryer off while in use because of the button location. It's not that big a deal but a simple flaw that could be fixed in the next model. I don't believe that it's any quieter than my last hairdryer but it does cut down the drying time and leaves my hair a bit shinier than the last one as well."
5,Smooth Hair in half the time,"Seems to be great so far, I have used this hair dryer 3 times and it makes my hair so smooth. I didnt even have to straighten it! It also cut my drying time in half. So far for the price I can't complain, very happy!"
2,318 Love:,"Although I'm from the same area as this group, I was very disappointed with the overall album. It lacks creativity and lyricism. The album is filled with elementary lyrics and sub-par production."
4,delightful,"A wonderful and light tale. I picked it up because I had never before seen a regency that was set after the marriage of two people in love. The storyline was amusing, the characters fairly well drawn, and the premise engaging. The author deals well with the marriage of two people from totally different families. I suspect those with difficult in-laws will be particularly delighted by this charming story of a husband and wife trying to make a life for themselves. I recommend it highly."
1,Very poor book,"Even though this book looks like an advanced Tai Chi book in reality it tells you about nothing. Nothing about the back spine management on how to generate energy while you are pushing (or whatever you are doing in tai chi work). There is something on accumulating energy in the position that's absolutely not useful. Even the younger beginner understands the back leg needs to work like a spring without buying this ""advanced"" book. But the question is not on how the back leg should work, what it is exspected from a book like this is to get tips and training methods on the ""back spine and waist /hips work"" that's the real point on generating martial power in Tai Chi and Internal Martial Art. The level of this book is so lower that is absolutely not comparable with other Dr Yang's books I've read and reviewed."
4,great historical perspective,"The reading is dry, but it is a great picture of what things were like in the 60s and how our struggles have repeated themselves. A unique perspective of social services coming from economists."
5,Outstanding Ideas,I picked this book up hurriedly and found it to be excellent. I have a gift shop that I have displayed some of my crafts that I made and I am unable to keep them in the store for the enjoyment of my customers. Everyone wanted to purchase the terracotta fountains especially. The book is easy to follow that any beginner would be able to do. I could not recommend it more highly.
3,Pretty bottle,"I bought this as a decoration for my bathroom and it's quite pretty. I haven't opened it so I can't vouch for the oil in it, but the bottle is very attractive."
3,Not as many practices as it seems,"This is a nice vinyasa-style practice with good instruction. But be aware that it doesn't contain 12 different practices. It's basically one practice, edited differently to make the different versions."
2,A GIRL THAT JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN,"First, I should say I am not a GAMER I am just someone that likestec toys and wanted a Playstation to get into what it is all about. I try to pick games that I think will be higher on graphics and entertaining story and lower on skill levels.For me this was not the game to get. It just was too hard for me to keep up with, as far as pushing the right buttons at the right time. I did enjoy the club house BUT unless you WIN more then you Lose there is not much to do there so, needless to say, I traded this game in a long time ago."
5,Next best thing if you cant be at the beach,"I played this game for about 4 day so far. The graphics are great and so is the game play. The controls are simple to learn but the game is difficult to master. The game is basically 2-on-2 beach volleyball. The game can be played as a single player with an AI teammate. The game supports up to 4 players in Exhibition mode and up to 2 in a team in the other modes when you are playing against the AI players. The game is fun to play and addictive. If you live in a place (Detroit, MI) where you can mostly dream of being at the beach this is a fun way to get away. I highly recommend this game."
4,Similarity to Dead or Alive Xtreme Volleyball Games,"I love and appreciate this game, which I have been playing for longer than 5 years. I love the women from different nationalities, music, background stages, etc. This may be similar but not as better than Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball (Xbox) and Dead or Alive Xtreme 2 (Xbox 360).Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach VolleyballDead Or Alive Xtreme 2Dead Or Alive Paradise"
3,Not the greatest game ever made,"this game is fun if you like to have long rallys where they only end on an error. You hardy ever get a kill unless it is on easy, and even then, it is only because they dont even try for the ball. It's not a terrible game, but it is not the greatest."
4,This book tells the story from both sides.,"I thought that it was a very good book, and I would recommend it to every one. This book doses a good job telling the other side of the story. The Outsiders is very descriptive book, S.E. Hinton dose a good job giving you all the kids backgrounds. One of my favorite parts of the book is when the greasers fight the soc'es and they finely prove to them that they are just as important as anyone else. This book dose a good job of putting things into your eyes. Jonny finely found the meaning of it is rough all over. This book also is good at pointing out the good and the bad on both sides of town. Pointing out the boys many different personality is another one of my favorite parts of the book. I really like this book and I would urge everyone to read it."
4,What I Think,"I like the story because it is very exciting. The brothers try to keep out of the Soch's hangout, but they catch up with the Soch's everytime. The Soch's leader is killed by Johnny, one of the Greasers. He is known as the gang ""pet"" because he was beat up by one car full of Soch's that the group hated. The Greasers have smoked or are smoking, have criminal records, and are all a big major group of brothers as they call them selves. My summary for the book is that I kind of am two sided on it. I mean that I like some of it and I don't like some of it. But, I know one thing, that I think kids shouldn't run from there fears but face them like grown up's. So, if you think about getting the book for your kids, get it for them when they get older. That is what I think about the book The Outsiders."
5,Great book!,"I am 11 yrs. old and my 6th grade class read the Outsiders for our first literature book. It was a really action-packed book. There was sadness also when Ponyboy's two friends die. The book gives a good idea of gang life. I especially liked it because my teacher gave me this information sheet about S.E. Hinton, and it said that there really were Socs (Socials) and Greasers in Tulsa, Oklahoma where the story takes place, and where S.E. Hinton lived when she wrote the book at the age of 16, and where she lives now. Hope this information about S.E. Hinton and information about the book really encourages YOU to buy this book. It is one of my favorite books, which I am actually glad we read in class and wrote a book report on."
5,I Think this book was the best .,"I don't think I have read a better book in my life . Now I am hooked on S.E. Hinton Books. My favorite part was when Dally ,Johnny, and ponyboy saved the kids in the old abandoned church I have never been sad over a book but this made me upset"
3,Ok book...not great,"This book is really fine..only, it ended in a kind of a stupid way. It is good but not better than ""That was then this is now"". And the title also doesnt have to do anything with the book. So its not perfect, but its aight. -alian"
4,FOR SCHOOL- I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT,THE OUTSIDERS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS AND THE MOVIE WAS AWESOME. I SAW THE MOVIE WHEN I WAS IN THE 7TH GRADE. THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME I READ THIS BOOK. I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN.PONYBOY IS MY FAV. CHARACTER
5,Super review,"The book ""The Outsiders"" is one of the best books I have ever read. Your head stays in the book and you never want to put it down. Some parts in the book may surprise you--some surprised me. Some other reasons I like the book are that the action stays with you from beginning to end. Also, the main character, Pony Boy is great. S.E. Hinton wrote a good book and you should try it out."
5,Great Book for someone who hates to read,"I am now a freshman in high school and read ""The Outsiders"" back in 7th grade because it was required reading for middle school. At first, it just didn't intrigue me. I don't really like to read to begin with, but later I realized this was a great book! After reading it, and then seeing the movie...it made me want to read the book again. That's when I got all the details that I didn't catch the first time when reading it. ""The Outsiders"" is my all time fav book and the only book that I can read over and over without getting tired of it. --That's pretty good for someone that doesn't enjoy reading, right? hehe. I recommend this book for EVERYONE! A must read people, if you didn't get to read it in middle school! hehe =)"
4,The Outsiders Review 4 School,"In my opinion i found this book to be pretty good even though it isnt normally the type of book i read. The one thing i dont really like is the 70s setting. That isnt exactly the time period i like or even understand especially the lingo. But its well thought out and it seems amazing that a girl can end up writing about this kind of thing. Especially all the violence, it isnt really the kind of thing that girls in that time period really thought about as far as i know"
2,Heh,I had to read this for my Social Studies class. I finished in in abiout 2 and a half hours....I thought it was quit poor. The dialouge was weak and the main characters friedns wre criminals...
5,This was such an AMAZING book!,"I am a 7th grader and I read the book THE OUTSIDERS over the summer and did a book report on it. I absolutely loved this book! It was amazing and the author did a great job on details. I never realized how bad it is in some parts of the world. This book made me realize that not everyone has a good home or decent parents- or even parents at all. This book taught me a lot and I will continue to re-read this book. The story was a little funny and it was REALLY SAD! But it was a GREAT book! If you don't believe me then read it yourself! I had doubts to this book before I read it but once I was in the middle of it I just couldn't stop reading! And I'm not a big fan of reading. In the past couple years I have only read about one book that wasn't required for school. And even if I never in my life will be required to read this book, I'll do it anyway because it is just a really enjoyable book to read. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I hope you buy it!"
1,What can I say,"I did not like this book. I had to do a report on it for my grade 7 class. I know you may right me off as a teen who does not understand great reading but I read all the New York Times bestsellers and usually enjoy them, I fond this book a sterio type of gangs life. I found the movie alright though. But I guess alot of people like this book so read if it you want or watch the movie which has an added bonus Tom Cruise! Seriously though maybe it is just my opinon of what type of book I like. There is plenty of exciment in this though for you adventure seekers, but I like mysteries soyou guys may rate this very well, howerver for my review I do not like this book"
1,Look Deeper into the words to find the REAL meanings,"The Outsiders was a really unrealistic book to read in this age...teenagers may not be able to relate or connect to the characters, nevertheless try to understand why these fellows in the book turn out the way they are at the end. Sure, the drugs and gangs may be exciting, but deeper thoughts were meant for this book, of which grade school/middle school/ and even high school readers may not be able to truely grasp."
1,Read it in school.:(,"So, my langauge art teacher made us read it and the entire way through i was bored.HATED IT!!! Then to top it off i lost the book and had to bye a knew one..Well if your looking for quality the book is ..nice..but whats inside the book isnt To be honest i learned my lesson and wont read books from like the 1970's if your 13 like me or younger you will hate it. Imm sorry but this is now my new least favorite book.Ive read alot of bad books."
1,maybe a real book,"why cant there be the normal verison not the audible version, people want to read their books. not hav people tell it to them"
1,The outsiders,"This books seems dull and never gets to a conclusion. S.E. Hintons writing is ok for a 16 year old, but the fact she got a D+ in english class apears in mayn key points in teh story wich dosent impress me.... By thhe time see reachs a climax such as the ""rumble"" it is more like a downfall.....The lesson in this book might be good for a middle school student, but i feel older kids should be challenged not ""spoon fed"" on of the most meaningless books ive ever read.I didn't like this book. It is too siple and out dated. There was to much crying also coke bootles come in plastic these days... Maybe someone will look into this and upddate this book. It might be a little beter but the book was still slow."
5,"""what a book""!!","This book makes you never want to put it down its 1 of a kind, im really glade i read it,""and im not really into reading books!!"" s.e hinton is a great autor :)"
5,Great,"We read this book in 7th grade. I didn't understand it on my own, but when we discussed the social issues of the Socs VS. The Greasers, I found it to be one of my favorite books ever"
4,The veiw of a teenager,"At first I thought the book was going to be boring,because of the setting .I thought it reflected on how their gang was like friendships now, like when johnny was in trouble the gang helpt him out like some friends do when another friend is in trouble.in the middle of the book it has more action when johnny kills the boy and ponyboy and him hide out in the church it shows even though how johnny is not always scared, but he is brave and courageous.Dally also shows his true colors when he helps save thoughs kids in the burning church.I would recoomand this book to aperson who can relate to how this gang is in all the different personalites."
5,"The outsiders""Greaser Family""","The book is told by an fourteen year old boy who is part of a gang called the ""Greasers"".There's about six more peopel who are in the gang, Johnny,Sodapop,Steve, Dally,Darry, and Two-bits mathews.They look out for each other. There's another gang called the ""Socs"". Their the cold hearted gang. They don't care if your dieing cept if your one of the socs but they'll let you die.As the book goes on the two gangs get in a couple fights and one of those fights Bob(one of the socs) gets killed by Johnny becausen he was hurting ponyboy.So they run away. That's all im going to say your going to have to read the book to find out what happen's after. I really like the book and i would recomend the book to all kids."
2,"Dated, poor choice for ESL","40 or 50 years ago this might have seemed like a topical, edgy story. Today though, it seems irretrievably dated: the slang, the bifurcated social world, the emphasis on petty crime and ""hoods"". The character's evolution through the story's traumas has some mild interest, but now much of it comes across as trite. Again, perhaps a book for its time, but for a time that has passed. For ESL and English students, there is not much that gives insight into modern life, and it is plain wrong to give them misspellings, bad grammar, and ancient slang as content worthy of language study. For ESL purposes, especially. Older readers might enjoy this trip down an old, old path."
5,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is an awsome book, its my favorite. It is about gangstas like me and fagget socs like the preps. Johnycakes is just like me, he stabed a soc in the back when he was drowning one of my boys and ran away to an abandon church which ended up on fire. Also, theres this kid dallas winston that stole a magazing from a store and got shot down under a street light, hes just like me too. So i recomend this book to anyone whos almost as gangsta as me, even though none of you are even close. Iight peaceeee.word"
5,rockin book,I loved this book because you never know what is going to happen. Plus I think it's wierd that people would go into gangs. I feel sad for Johnny for dying saving other people.
3,The mouse and the motorcycle,"Ralph the mouse just can't resist trying to ride the toy motorcycle someone left on the hotel room tabel. It's the telephone ringing that sends Ralph and the bike sailing right off the table and down into the wastepaper basket.Ralph thinks he's a goner-trapped in the basket-until along comes Keith, the owner of the motorcycle. Not only does Keith save Ralph's life, he teaches him how to ride. And that's just the beginning of Ralph's exciting nighttime adventures in the hallways of the hotel!"
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read!,"This is definitely the best book that I have ever read. I was totally absorbed in it. It was very dramatic and made me want to cry, but I loved it! I read it twice, and I've seen the movie about fifty times. After reading it, I had to read other books by S.E. Hinton too. It's definitely one of the best books for young adults of all time !!!!"
5,It's DE Bomb!!!;),I just read this book for language. We finished it in class. I'll tell ya stright forward it's the best book the the entire world. I LOVED the way it started and ended the exact same way. S.E. Hinton is the best author in the world. It's like she's talking right to you. You forget that a girl really wrote it! Tomorrow we are gonna watch the movie. I hear it's the best movie especially because it has Tom Cruise in it. Well that's about it. PEACE OUT!
4,The Outsiders,"What I thought of this book was really in the the average above. It had some ups and downs, but I really like the book. The book is about family problems and differences between the Socs and Greasers. Ponyboy, main character, has to face many difficult challenges with family and friends. Most of all he has to try to resolve their differences with the Greasers and the Socs. Read on to find the adventure of Ponyboy and his buddies...This is a really great book!"
4,Even good the second time around,"I read The Outsiders in junior high school back in the late 70's, and still like it; I finished it again, just today. I could sorta tell that S.E. Hinton is a female given some of the observations the main character, Ponyboy, made of people in his life during the story. It's a cool 'guy' story, but at the same time is rivited with human emotion across the spectrum, manifesting itself in the usual places, life's circumstances and human relationships, usually betraying an inner suffering. It's a bummer that orphaned adolescents raise themselves on chocolate cake, cigarettes, beer, and pepsi, but by the end of the story, the main characters have shown promising growth through life's circumstances that the reader is left with a certain optomistic outlook that there could be something in the future for them. A good story...I recommend it."
5,Outsiders cd review,I really like the ease of finding specific passages in the cd. As a teacher it is very nice to be able to go to a specific track and not have to fast forward to the place I need to be. The Outsiders has been a favorite for all my students. It's popularity never seems to lessen. It's relevance is as important now as it was in the 60's.
5,The best and still the best,Im a 7th grader and my teacher just got done reading the book Outsider to the class. Outsiders is a very good book. I liked it very much.Cause it talks about teens and there problems. I like Sodia pop cause he sounds very nice and hes nice to his borthers. Outsiders sound very realistic. I also seen the move. It was not very good.
5,book reveiw By:N.A.,hi I am a student and my teacher read the book outland to our class. I would recommend this book because it has some of everything in it. I read the book because I like S.E. Hintons booksand as soon as you start reading this book you will not be able to put it down. I also would recommend the movie. Because it is shorter then the book but now you are able to see the pictures and it is easier to understand on the movie. The book also explains more to you.
5,The Outsiders,"I read this book when I was in the 6th or 7th grade, and it wasthe first book that moved me to tears. It is an awesome book, and Ihighly recommend it to anyone of any age."
5,Makes you think what insignificant violence can cause,"I liked a lot the book, at first I was not so excited about reading it, i had to read it for my English class, but after i started reading it i could not take my attention of the book, it makes you think about the violence that exists, just because of diferent clothes or diferent hairstyle, I recomend this book to people that belong to gangs or something like it, by the way I want to say hello to my teacher Dino!"
4,~GREAT BOOK PPL!!!~ U SHOOD READ IT!!!,I DON'T ENJOY READING BUT THIS BOOK WAS AN EXCEPTION. WHEN I STARTED READING IT I JUST COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. IT TOOK ME 2 HOURS TO FINISH THE WHOLE BOOK. THE BOOK IS ABOUT 2 GANGS. ONE GANG IS NAMED THE GREASERS AND THE OTHER THE SOCS(SHORT FOR SOCIALS). THE 2 GANGS GET IN TOO A LOT OF FIGHTS AND THEY ARE LIKE SWORNE ENEMIES. I AIN'T GONA SAY NO MORE SO YOU'RE GONA HAVE TO READ THE BOOK IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TOO THE GANGS AND IF THEY BECOME FRIENDS OR IF THEY STAY AS ENEMIES FOREVER.
5,"He ain't a Soc, he's just a guy that wanted to talk.","The Outsiders, is a must read and teaches the reader about life. ""He ain't a soc, he's just a guy that wanted to talk."" That sums it up. Stay gold."
5,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is a book about the natural fight between the rich and the not so rich. Ponyboy is one of the not so rich and they are called Greasers. All he has is his gang and his brothers. Ponyboy's friend ,Johnny, kills one of the Socils (the rich) and that's when his world falls apart. Or does it come together? The Outsiders is a great book that is exciting until the end!"
5,This was a very inspireing book.,"The outsiders is a book i recommend to everybody. It tells about gang rivalry in the 1960's. this book is about a group of boys who prove the true meaning of friendship,brotherhood and a special kiship in which two friends show and prove to each other during a short period of time. It shows what life was like for childeran living in the poorer part of town,and trying to survive and overcome tragady, death, and anger. This is a book i recommend to children 11- any age."
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK!!!!!!!!,"This is quite possibly one of the best books I've ever read-and I've read a lot! I average about 4000-5000 pages a month, about 12-15 or more books. This book has everthing, and is almost perfect, but I do criticize Dallas dying. I don't know why. The book is really good, but the movie.... well, you know how it is. Books are usually better than movies."
5,an amazing novel,"The Outsiders is a wonderful book, a real page turner. The book is about a gang called ""the greasers"". Ponyboy at 14 is the youngest in the gang. His older brothers Darry and Sodapop are in the gang also. On the other side of town live the socs, which stands for socials. This crazy gang always jump the greasers for fun. One day the socs go too far and two of the greasers run away and hide. You have to read the book and see what happens. You will love this extremely exciting book. At some points in the story I felt like I was there with the greasers. After you read this book you will feel that you must be brave through tough times. You will also be thankful for everything that you have."
5,This book was one of the best books I've read.,"We can all relate to this book with reality. Eventhough the time period was different, it had a lot of similarities with the way life is on the street today. I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,I Just cant stop reading it!!!!!!,I am in Jumior High and I absolutely LOVED this book. The suspense made you never put it down! I felt that the author S.E. Hinton made me feel and love the characters in the book. She really brought the book to life. The book really described each and every character so it as like you knew them. I would rcemend this book to anyone.My favorite characters were Soda Pop- because i felt like he was a real nice brother and very understanding.And i loved Darry- because he was the fatherly figure but no one REALLY understood him.
5,How do I think about this book?,"This is the first book I had read in the America. Maybe you don't believe what I said, but it is true. I never read through all the parts of book before. I thought it was too long, or too difficut for me. But this one is not. I like it very much because it's easy to understand what the author is going to tell next, or maybe because it was written by a 16-year-old girl. It is a great lesson for any child or young adult, to deal with problems and life. And it tought us the money is not the most important thing in the world, love or friendship is."
4,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders was a fabulous book. It is a heroic tale about boys who grow up in not the average town. Rumbles on friday nights, drive in movies. This is the life of a hoodlum and the life of Ponyboy. There is always something happening and it is definitly a page turner. If you like non stop action and fun this is the book for you. This is for mostly for anyone one who like a awesome quik read. I liked the book because the characters are interesting and by the first 10 pages you know what the character thinks so you can react to feelings they may have. It put me in the story and it will do the same to you!"
5,Life of Poverty,"The Outsiders is a wonderfully great story. It is about a fourteen year old boy named Ponyboy. When his best friend named Johnny killed a rival gang member, called the Socs. Even though Johnny was very sorry and though he did it for protection he had to run away. If Johnny and Ponyboy stayed they both thought of electric chairs and years in jail. That is the very first beginning of THE OUTSIDERS.The Outsiders is a book for kids up to all ages. It helps a kid to understand what being poor and being lucky is. A poor kid could have their parents,uncles,brothers,sisters,and grandparents still could be lucky. The unlucky kid is the kid without parents. You could have all the money in the world and can still be depressed and sad. As commercials said, ''happiness,priceless, with Visa Master Card you could buy anything.''"
4,"*~*Love, Hate, Blood, Tears*~* -The Outsiders","Ponyboy never knew what he was in for having grown up on the wrong side of town. Since his parents die his world shatters. Darry, the oldest brother, has to keep the family in line. Even in such a rural town in Ohio, so much action takes place. Greasers are separated from the Socs because the Greasers live on the wrong side of town, and the Socs live on the wealthy side. When both gangs are searching for some fun, a rumble comes in mind. One night, Ponyboy and his friend Johnny, find themselves at the wrong place at the wrong time and they find themselves participants in a horrific scene. Was Johnny just using self defense, or did he go to far? After that night, they were fugitives running from the cops. Will they keep running forever or will they have the courage to turn themselves in for their own good? To find out, read the intriguing novel The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton."
4,The Outsiders,"I read The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton because my English teacher recommended it as an engaging novel. In the beginning, it was difficult to understand what was going on because S.E Hinton uses a lot of old slang. Also I don't know much about the American teenagers, especially from the 1960's. During the first two pages, I was opening the dictionary all the time, but by the third chapter, I felt as if I learnt a new language. I also realized that I really related to the characters. Ponyboy and his friends had the same problems as we have as teenagers now-a-days everywhere in the world. The book is honest because the author is a teenager who knows what the life is like. It's more truthful than when an adult writes about their teenage life."
4,Great for teens and adults,"This is a great book written in a different voice not many people have. It is a chilling story and makes you have a new respect for your home, family and friends."
3,Being an Outsider,"I liked the book because it tells you the story of the boys from the hood, and how they struggled to go on through life fighting Socs who are the rich guys. I rate this book as a 3 star book because it is not very deep, it is more like a book for starters, but it is since it was written by a 16 year old, who was tired of the situation at her school."
2,The outsiders,the book was very good. I like the book better then the movie. i would have to say the book is better for readers and the movie is a good sumary.later Turkey
5,Outsiders should not be banned,"Outsiders should not be banned for many reasons. First off, it shows that just because you live in a little crummy house and have no parents doesnt mean you arent nice or smart and you dont care about anything. Pony boy was a hero when he saved those children from the burning building and he was not stero typed as a hero. He was stero typed as someone who was not intelligant and got in fights and did drugs. It also shows you things you should not do in life. It does have some violence and other things but it shows you that doing bad things in life is not going get you the life you really want. This book changed my perspective on people and life. I truly belive everyone should be allowed to read this and should do so."
2,Really Depressing,Maybe the reason why I didn't like this book was because I was to young. I felt it was sad and gave a sort of hopless feeling at the end. However I can't help but like the point of view of the poor sides life. I found it to be cleaver and sad but not at all uplifting.
5,Wonderful Book!,This was my absolute favorate book! I was amazed at the charactization and diolauge. WONDERFUL!!!
4,The Book Review of the Outsiders,"In this book it tells whether rich, or poor, you still have some kind of problem. The rich kids are called socials or socs, and the poor kids are called greasers. Socials are mean, thinking they rule everything, and they pick on the greasers because the greasers are low class people, or poor. Greasers rob banks, mug kids, and still things. But not all greasers are like that.Pony boy Curtis gets good grades, likes to read, and doesn't like to fight, and he is a greaser. his life soon will change when one of his friends kill a social in order to save Ponyboy. When it changes he goes through life problems and learning how to dill with them.This story is a must read story wrtten by S.E. Hinton, and teaches us all we have good in us no matter what you are."
4,The Outsiders,"Two completely different worlds, with so many differences and yet similarities at the same time. Ponyboy, a four-teen year old greaser lives a life with his two brothers where the two worlds are the low-class greasers, and the mustang loving socials. Ponyboy and the gang are always watching their backs for a couple of Socials to come up and jump them. He usually handled his life well, and was proud of being a greaser. Until things get taken too far and his friend, Johnny, kills a member of a gang. The effects of the murder get to Ponyboy and all that he knew starts to crumble, and he sees that both worlds have problems and all he needs to do is ""stay gold""."
4,The Ousiders,I felt this was a great book for kids my age. It is all about these 2 kinds of people groups fighting and just not getting along with eachother. It shows that it is so much easier to be friends with everyone than to know there is another group of people trying to hunt you down and try to be better than you. The Outsiders make you feel like you never want to put the book down for even a second. It keeps you wondering what is going to happen next.
4,i would recomend this book,The book The Outsiders by S.E Hinton. Is a realistic fiction book about two gangs. The narrator of this book is a Greaser. He lives with his two older brothers Darry and Soda. His brothers are Greasers too.At the begining of the book the narrator gets in a gang fight with the Socs. The Socs and the Greasers are gang rivals. If a Soc saw a Greaser on the street they would kill him. Thats almost what happened to the narrator but his brothers saved him. The rest of the story is all about gang fights and saving each others lives. Its about not leaving a member behind and fighting with all you got. I really liked this book and would recomend it to any one looking for adventure and action. I would also recomend this book for any one in 6th grade or older.
4,Real Life,"I gave the book, The Outsiders, four stars. Overall the book was pretty good. I liked the book but I thought the ending was too boring, it could of been better.I like what time period its in because it tells how things were different back then.The one thing I didn't like about this book was how the Greasers and the Socs hated each other. There is so much of that going on right now, I've seen a lot more of it since September 11th.If you want an exciting book to read I would recommend this book.A Student at Secrist Middle School, 1st Period Language Arts"
4,The Outsiders,The Outsiders is a great book that was written by S.E.Hinton. The book is about a boy named Ponyboy whose parents have passed away. Ponyboy lives with his brothers on the wrong side of town. They are called the Greasers. On the other side of town there are the Socs (short for Socials)that are very rich. Ponyboy's life is just fine until his friend kills somebody. Then after that a whole chain of events happen to Ponyboy that keep you wanting more!! I would highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults.
4,Wonderful book,The Outsiders is a wonderful book. My favorite part was when Ponyboy and Johnny saved those kids from the fire. They put aside the murder to saved the children in the burning church although they knew that the public would soon find out about the murder. What I did not like about this book was the ending. Although some socs and greasers were friends like Cherry and Ponyboy. I still wish that S.E.Hinton could have made the story end with a little more friendship between the greasers and the Socs.
5,SaMaNtHa'S ReViEw,"I am 14a nd i have read this book twice. it just amazes me everytime i read it. It really shows you how life was for The Greasers and Socs. Their will never be a common ground for any different group of people. This book teaches you that people and groups can be deciving. This story is about a boy named Ponyboy who lives with his two brothers ""sodapop"" and ""darry"". His best friends johnny really took me by surprise. Johnny really has no home his parents don't like him at all. Dally is just like johnny his parents don't care for him. Dally in this stpry really takes u by surprise beacuase he shows his true emtion's and he really cares for johnny. This book to me has two main theme's 1)"" People and groups can be deciving"" 2) ""SHowing your true colors is the best thing anyone can do."""
4,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is an interesting book about a gang but its main focus is Pony boy. Pony boy is his real name, his father was very creative. Pony boy has two brothers, one is Darry, and the other is Soda Pop. Their mother and father died in car wreck, so Darry and Soda Pop work at a gas station. The other members of the gang are Two bit, Jonny, and Dallas. I recommend that you read as the gang gets into trouble. But the best part is that there are no commercials and if you need to take a break no problem. This is a great book. It kept me laughing, crying, and thrilled all at the same time."
3,Ponyboy,"Ponyboy Ponyboy is intelligent in many ways, he loves to learn new thing all the time . Some things that make him intellgent are reading Gone With The Wind . Ponyboy also wrote a them about his life . He used big words that most normal teens wouldn't use . Ponyboy does very well in school and makes all A's . I wonder what adventure he will go threw next!"
4,Outsiders,The Outsiders was a very good book. What I enjoyed about this book was that the way it tells about how kids lived back then and it's similiar to the way some kids live today. I would recomnend this book because you can learn about the negative things these kids did and keep away from thoses things.
4,A young-adult book that's fun for adults too!,"Even though this book is clearly written for young adults, I didn't read it until after I graduated from college. I enjoyed it so much that I immediately introduced it to my eighth grade English class, and they loved it. Since then, I've read it with my classes almost every year, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet."
5,Best book ever written!!!,"I absolutely loved this book. Friends who are closer than family taking their lives day by day, and taking it on as it comes. They meet many struggles but always manage to get their way out of it together. It was a book about character and friendship, two of the most important things in life. This book is more than just a good book, it was completely phenominal!!! I read it to my kid sister for a lesson on what it was really like to have a hard life. (She complains that she has the worst life ever and she has it soooo hard.)If you ever get the chance read this book. Not just becuse it is a wonderful piece of literature, but because it is an enjoyable life lesson that will stay with you forever."
5,unexplainably fantastic!!!!!!,"What can I say about the best book I've ever read! This story is a real tradgedy, but makes good pionts. I suggest it to anyone and everyone."
5,The Outsiders,"I enjoyed this book. It is an outstanding realistic story about a teenage boy named Ponyboy and the events that take place after the worst night of his life. As a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks, Ponyboy is labeled as a greaser. On that horrible night Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny find themselves in a big mess. Johnny spreads the poison in the air by killing a soc and sets off a chain of events."
3,not bad,"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton is very well writen and I enjoyed it alot. The best character in this book would be Johnny because on the inside he is a good person even though he is a member of the gang known as ""Greasers."" The best most exciting part (other than the rumble) is when Johnny, Ponyboy, and Dally save the children from a fire in a old church. The theme of this book is to stay young and ""gold"". The book is much more interesting than the movie but it wasn't very exciting."
3,I had to read this for English Class,Well the book is INCREDIBLY boring at first but around the 5th chapter it begins to actually get interesting. Too much happens at once during the climax. There are much better books to read that are worth your time.
5,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders is a terrific book for everyone. It is a exciting adventure as Ponyboy and the Greasers, deal out their daily problems. This book would have to be one of my favorite's. One minute it is sad and the next they are getting into fights. The Greasers are a group of poor kids who's parents let them get into all sorts of trouble. They rob banks and gas stations for fun. The Socs are an group of rich or wealthy people. They beat up people for fun. They have a little better education too. The Greasers and Socs hate each other. But in the book they see the differences and feelings between one another. S.E. Hinton couldn't have wrote this book any better."
3,This is a good book,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. I read it and I love it. This is a good book.
4,Absolutely loved it!!,I've heard of this book for many years and never had the chance to read it. Now that I have it is already on my list of favorite books! It's so hard not to fall in love with everyone one of the characters! Definitely a recommended read!
5,Outsiders,"My all-time favourite book! A heart touching story, filled with cool characters and just a great book anytime, anywhere. Another great book is the sequel to The Outsiders is That Was Then, This Is Now."
3,The outsiders,It was a good book but a little predictable at some pointsBut still I liked it and hope you do
4,Requires Maturity,"I was assigned to read this book in the 4th grade (I went to a Montasauri school) and I remember hating every inch of it. I was appalled by the violence and my fourth grade self could not grasp the themes and the importance. Then later this book was assigned for me for the 9th grade and when I read it for the second time, I was surprised to find myself enjoying it. It turned out not to be the book itself, which was very well written, but I was just not ready for it when I first read it. I'd say make sure your son or daughter (yes, this book is for either gender) is at least in the 7th grade (6th if they are mature) before letting them read this book. The Outsiders do have some very important themes that are important for young people to learn before they get to far in highschool."
3,The Outsiders - Review,"The Outsiders is a tremendous book for all ages. It is a story of young boy of whom is said to be a greaser.A person who is not liked by society due to numerous reasons.He is a talented young boy, however he does not use this to his advantage.He and his gang partake in an exhilarating and bloodcurdling adventure. Read it!"
5,The best book I've ever read.....and I've read A LOT!,"You get attached to the characters so much, you feel like crying once you finish reading it...connects to so many people in life today...IF YOU LOVED THE MOVIE, YOU'LL LOVE THE BOOK EVEN MORE!!!! Great, 2 thumbs up!"
5,A Timeless Classic,"The Outsiders is a timeless classic all about the trials of life. Anyone can identify with it and learn something from all the characters. I love how every chapter is a page turner and how Ponyboy endears himself to the reader with every passing page. S.E Hinton is to be cespecially commended for the ending of the book, which was thought provoking and satisfying. Thanks for a great reading experience"
2,What's with all the hype?,"This book is downright nasty and retarded. It over-exaggerates , insults the poor and brings pity to those who read it. I have never read such garbage in my life... Don't read Outsiders, unless your really, REALLY desperate. P.S- the final rumble was so lame it hurt my eyes. Pity Pony and Hinton!"
3,A little disappointing,"This audiobook is okay. The quality is good, but there is not a guide to what is the tracks of the four different cd's. Not user friendly in that sense. The narrator is also very country--which I'm not sure is appropriate for a supposed Oklahoma kid."
1,Yuck,"Definitly not reccomended. All this book does is glorify gangs, crime, drinking, and smoking yet my teacher continually tried to tell us what a great lesson it taught. Huh."
1,A Terrible Read,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. I was forced to read it in my English class and I hope I never have to again. S.E. Hinton does a quite shabby job of portraying the boys in this novel, whose abominable grammar is irritating and difficult to understand. The plot is ridiculous and the dialogue is poor; I found myself laughing in the most serious parts of the book. The characters are interminably dumb, and their actions are equally foolish. Hinton adds an obnoxious air of melodrama and sappiness to the story in so many parts, namely the one where Dally ""kills himself"". Ponyboy's inept attempts to be poetic and deep annoyed me especially. The characters also set horrible examples for today's youth with their inexcusable and absurd behavior. I advise you all not to read this book unless you are prepared to undergo extreme boredness for a good laugh at mediocre writing."
1,This is one of the crappiest books I've ever read!!!,"this book has no plot and it doesn't interest me one bit. these greaser guys are all phsychos with long sideburns. This book is way too violent and it sometimes makes you sick.S.E. hinton is not very good at describing the characters and the setting, obviously. i would definitely not recommend this book to anyone."
1,It gets 1 whole star because there isn't a 0 option,"This book was perhaps the worst I've ever read. I don't understand why so many people can actually enjoy it. When I was heartlessly forced to read it in school (funny that, school, you'd think that in school they wouldn't want you to read books that glorify gangsters), many other kids enjoyed it. I HATED it. Perhaps this is because I felt to childish for my tastes. Everybody had a lame nickname, the writing was without merit of any kind, the entire book reaked of kiddieness. For the love of all that you hold sacred, I urge you not to read this book!!!!"
5,great book,"I had to read this book when I was in 8th grade and I looked at the cover and read the back and thought I was goin to hate it. I started reading it the night I got it for my assignment and I could not stop! I read the whole book in about 2 hours and it really moved me. (Although it is a quick read it really is an incredible book) It takes alot to make me cry-and i mean ALOT-but his book brought tears to my eyes. The friendships, hurt, pain, loyalty, cliques, gangs, and humor in this book brought it all together in a wonderful story! It has been my favorite book ever since the night I read it. I still read it often and each time I read it I end up crying. This is a MUST read book. The relationships between the characters in this book are incredible and I absolutley loved the ending!! You have to read this! If you do not feal like spending the money, go and check the book out at the library! You will be surprised!"
4,I would recommend this book to anybody.,This book represents adolesants dealing with poverty andprejudice very well. It shows us how kids deal with beingpoor and treated as a minority. I recommend it to people ofall ages.
5,The Outsiders,I thought the Outsiders was a great book becaues it showed me that it is important to not to have poupularity groups. we were all created equally. This book is the best book i have ever read.
5,an AMAZING book...,"""the outsiders"" is completely a book worth reading. I had hated all the other books until i got this one. It was bought and sitting on my desk in a week.almost anyone that starts to read this book will get captured in the story on the second page. i promise. i seriously wish there was some better way for me to describe it...it is my favorite book I have read so far...and cant stop reading it over and over.please buy this book...there are no great words in my imagination to explain it. you should really buy it and see for yourself. an amazing, beautifully sad story...I LOVE IT!"
4,The Outsiders...the book that changed my train of thought,"This book is one of a kind. We usually don't read books, but we really liked reading this book. We really liked the discriptive paragraphs and unique details of fight scenes. The way the author described their life styles was intriguing, which kept us reading the book. We enjoyed the psychological character development. Our lives changed so much since we read this very appealing book."
2,Too Outdated for Teenagers in this age,"I found this book too old to connect to real life these days. It may give a look into what your parents had done in the past, but for a modern day teenager, leather jackets and tons of grease are no more than a mere figment of their imaginations to see in real life.Quite similar to the themes in Go Ask Alice, where drugs and friends make all the difference in the world. Not an especially thourough deep look into each character's well being and thoughts, but emotions are well played out. This is more of a TEEN classic, not a classic that will last for centuries to come."
3,Soft Gangmembers,"At first, I thought ""Oh no, not another West Side story!"" Well, apart from the love story it looks a lot like it. Besides some parts, I did not like the story much. However, I can imagine that children, especially boys, from the age of twelve and above will love it. It is not a ""soft"" story though it handles about the feelings of some real tough guys. I was surprised by the part that two of these ""Greasers"" were reading Gone with the Wind. The part that Ponyboy finds out that all Greasers are dreaming of a better life was the most philosophic. That he and Johnny were aloud to be different from the others surprised me. The book is written from Ponyboy's point of view. I like it that the book ends in the same way as it started. The readers are actually reading Ponyboy's essay"
3,Not bad,"This book is a perfectly fine story about teenage kids in gangs, but it's simply not spectacular. One major dissapointment is that all of S.E. Hinton's books seem exactly the same--read The Outsiders four times and save your money."
3,Great book,"The book is great. The story is about ponyboy. Ponyboy lost his parents and only has his two brothers and his gang as family now. Johnny, his best friend, gets in trouble and they are forced to do some suspensful stuff. I recommend this book to everybody, all ages. Its full of suspense and action as well."
3,The OUTSIDERS,A troubled 14 year old boy who lives on the wrong side of the tracks. His name is Ponyboy. He and his friend kill another person form a rival gang and get into a lot of trouble. They decide to hide out somewhere safe until the whole thing blows over. After a week of hermit life and eating nothing but boloney sandwiches they make a critical decision. This decision effects what happens to Ponyboy and his friends. I liked the way the characters were so tuff and you could almost imagine yourself as Ponyboy.
4,The Outsiders,"The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton, describes the lives of young adults when they are going through tough times. The ""greasers"", Ponyboy, Sodapop, Darry, Two-Bit, and Dally are the poorer boys of the city. The Socs,(also called the Socials) are the higher class of boys in the city. They bully and beat-up the greasers just because they are poorer than they are. I enjoyed this book due to the characters, how they act, and how humorous they are. My favorite characters are Darry and Ponyboy. I like Darry because he is smart and strong. I also like Darry because he likes to show off his muscles. I like Ponyboy because he enjoys movies and he always sticks to his gut feeling. You should read The Outsiders- it is a great book!"
2,lame,". I love reading, but this book was awful! Maybe for seventh graders who don't read a lot of more ""mature"" books this might be a good book, because it tries to be that way but doesn't quite make it as other books i have read."
3,"""Classic?"" I think not. Still, a good book.","I enjoyed this book, but to call it a ""classic"" is really blowing it out of proportion. I read this in 8th grade, then two weeks later, I read a REAL classic, Catcher in the Rye. I'd recommend this book, but I wouldn't call it a ""classic."""
2,A book that is too labeled and out of touch.,THis was just another book trying to create some sort of dilemma that all ready exists. Characters don't create a sense of reality and this book is over all trash. You can make these assumptions without reading this book. It's a waste of time!
2,The book was ok,"The Outsiders I just finished reading the book, and then I watched the movie. I think the book is more descripitive than the movie. The characters looked like how they were described in the book, but their personalities weren't. I liked how the author discribed the characters. I understood what the characters were like. Dallas was my favorite character because he was the oldest and was always tough. He was different from the others and was the smartest."
2,"This book was alright, not that good","This book was kinda stale... First of all it wasn't something ANYONE could relate with, the society was totally fake maybe the author was dreaming when he thought up that ""society"" and there was no real ""plot"" i think the author tried to get a message across to the readers, but the fact that it was SO OBVIOUS shows a lot about his writing skill... If u want me to pick up something leave it in there for me to think about, dont smash it on my head with a hammer."
5,Outsiders brings you in,"My daughter, who absolutely hates to read, watched the movie and asked for the book. She has read it two or three times and says the movie doesn't do the book justice."
4,Great Literature Circle Book,The outsiders is a heroic book about the troubles of growing up as a greaser in town also full of Socs. Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny need to make difficult decisions after several accidents leading to them becoming heroes and juvenile delinquents. I would reccomend this book to people that enjoy stories with suprising twists and thrills along the way.
5,Excellent Performance,My students really enjoyed this reading of the book. I've never seen them so quiet.
3,The Outsiders audio cd,"My 8th grade students were put off by the extreme country-bumpkin accent in this audio recording. They didn't feel the accent truly matched the characters. The narrator read too slowly for them as well. I like using audio recordings in my classes, but I will be seeking a new one next year."
5,i love this book,"it was a great book, about a clash between ""greasers"" and ""socs"" and it follows what happens to the main character, Ponyboy. The book was impossible to put down and it even made me cry a little at times, but thats what a good book will do to you. I recommend this for teens because it has some violence and other things you may expect to find in a book about fights between gangs. This is a wonderful story of friendship and tragedy."
4,review of the best book ever,"This was a good book.I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.I also thought a woman could never write a book such as this one, so good.S.E. Hinton has a mind of her own.She put it in a perspective that people could really use and understand. The book was about the greasers and the socs(socials)They had grown up in hard times and they were just trying to overcome all of that and then here come the socials trying to mess up everything.......It was a well written book and I would recommend this book to anyone because it is a real like story.Its great. ...."
4,"""The Outsider"" a replacement family.","I liked the book, i thought it was a good veiw on how the social classes treated each other. The book showed that each side had a good side to them both. And that things aren't always what they seem to be. The book showed that even though you dont have a family your friends are always there for you. It showed trust and bonding."
5,The outsider Review,Hi my name is Bob.I raed The Outsiders it is a really good book.I liked this book because it show how people that is in gangs feel and how there life is.The Outsiders was one of the best books I ever read.If you like good books you will love this book.It has a lot or good prats in the book.The main person in this book is Ponyboy.I really think you should read this book.
5,A stroy of teenagers and their struggle with life....,"This story is so touching and spirited. It shows you what trust and loyalty truely means. I cried and laughed while reading this book and you will too. I feel in love with this book and you can just as easily. Imagine you, with two older brothers and your 'gang' friends. No mom, no dad. Just imagine, how would you get along? How would you suvive? How would you avoid the cops? Read this book to find out."
5,A really good book!,"OMG! The Outsiders is such a good book! I cried when it was over! When I first got the book in my LA class I thought it would just be another boreing book that we have to read in language arts class! But the whold class liked it! My best friend fell in love with Sodapop Dally! (I know, strange!) But if your looking for a good book to read I suggest this ine!"
4,Outsiders,"I read The Outsiders in my eighth period exploratory cass. I enjoyed thes book because there are thengs that deal about real life in a poor or just above poor point of view. My favorite charcter was Johnny because he was not only brave but was sincere to others. My least favorite charater is mostly Bob because he beat up people and didn't care if they got hurt. I think the book is like real life, like I said before it has a mainly poor point of view."
4,The Outsiders,"I loved this book. It was interesting, intriguing, and suspenful. It has a great moral that many people should take to heart and if they did the world would be a much better place. You will fall in love, as I have, with Soda, Ponyboy, Johnny, and many more. The book has one part when you can kind of tell that it was written by a 16 year old pupil (and it was when it was written) because the story kind of penetrated the set stage and was somewhat hrad to follow. It is a really great book, and I recommend to everyone, especially people who do not have a high self-esteem. I need to shut up now so that I don't give anything away, but this book will always stay gold."
5,the bestest,"I didn't know what this book was about, but my class is reading it. It is the best book I have ever read! I didn't think that I'd like it, but I did! If you haven't read this book, I suggest you pick it up right now because it is soooo good!"
4,It was real good!,"This book was the best ever. I personally liked Ponyboy, because I think that we have a lot in common. We both observe what is going on around us and then jugde. If you notice he was at the end of the book who really cared and because he observed, wrote about the past week in a report for his English class."
5,BeSt BoOk EvEr!,"This was a really good book it! You should read this book because when you read it, your nose never gets out of the book. I like to read books about kids and that is why I think I liked it so much! You should really READ it."
3,Ok...,"This book was ok but thats it. Maybe I have to be older to appreciate but i doubt it. I'll stick with books Like ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""A Christmas Carol""."
5,Probably the greatest book ever written about kids.,"This is the best book i have ever read. It relates very well to teenagers of all generations. Many problems are discussed. Ponyboy versus socs, Pony versus himself, Pony versus his brother Dairy. Everybody should read this book, it is the best book i have ever read."
4,Bringing novels to life,"Reading a novel is one thing but listening whilst reading adds a new dimension to it. The Outsiders is written by an American author and it's set in the 1960s. I am Australian and the language in the novel is not. It makes sense to listen to a trained actor deliver the novel with the correct intonation, dramatic intensity and charaterisation that simply reading cannot provide. The themes in The Outsiders are relevant to today's teenagers who deal with peer pressure, dysfunctional families and the all too human need to belong somewhere....anywhere. Conflict is sustained throughout and there is the final resolution. This is good to play on a car trip to keep teenagers engaged instead of hearing ""are we there yet?""or to improve reading skills by listening whilst reading. This is one way to help improve word recognition. Especially suitable for people with vision difficulties who may find it easier to listen to, rather than read a book. Very enjoyable."
5,SUPER BOOK!,THIS BOOK IS REALLY GOOD...WE HAD TO READ IT IN SCHOOL AND AT FIRST I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT AFTER A COUPLE OF CHAPTERS I CAUGHT MYSELF READING AHEAD! TRUST ME YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!
4,THE BEST BOOK EVER THE OUTSIDERS,THE BEST BOOK EVER THE OUTSIDERSThe Outsiders is a really great book. About a gang named the Greasers and the trouble the members go throw. There is a murder in the park. Ponyboy the narrator has no mom or dad so his oldest brother has to step in and watch them. They get in to a lot of fights. The story is slow at the start but it get better at the end. The character in the story stands up for each other.

The character in the story stands up for each other.
4,The Outsiders-Non Stop Pain And Action,"The Outsiders was like a football game: Non stop pain and action. The novel, by S. E. Hinton, is a fast-paced story about a family struggling to stick together on the bad side of town somewhere in Ohio. ""Greasers,"" such as Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, get jumped by the rich ""Socs."" Ponyboy is living with his two brothers because his mom and dad were killed in a tragic car-crash. His life is turned upside-down when his friend, Johnny, commits a horrible, gruesome crime. Ponyboy and Johnny go into hiding causing further disruption.The author, S. E. Hinton, writes a gripping, compassionate story engrossed in this remarkable, electrifying novel. The Outsiders was quite simple to read but, S. E. Hinton makes the reader really get to know the characters and explains their feelings very well. We would recommend this book to any child who is between sixth and eighth grade."
3,Magnificent Book,"There were two gangs that fought constantly in the story, they were also rivals. Ponyboy is the main character. He was always in trouble. I loved the book, because it explains why people shouldn't fight. I recommend that people read this book so they can get a clue about the gangs today."
3,a book of heros,"The outsiders is a good book that has to do with conflicts between two groups, the socs and the greasers. It is kind of violent because the two groups are often fighting. The book is sometimes difficult to follow because there are a lot if different charicters in the book, other than that it is a great book. It is full of action and suspense and I would recomened it to anyone who likes those types of books."
3,review,"I think this story was good but it could of been beter. Like when Johnney killed Bob, Johnney could of been kicking some of the soc's heads in."
3,A look into a violent world,"The Outsiders is a look into a world of gangs and violence though the true meaning of the book is about heros and friends that stick together through everything. I recommend this book to someone who likes to read about action and suspense. Throughout the book there are many fights between two gangs which makes the book exciting. One fault with the book is the many characters who seem to have similar names. This makes the book far to confusing. Altogether though, the book shows you how to be a true hero and how to keep friendships even through hard times."
3,the Outsiders,"This book could be one of the better books that I have read in my career as a reader. If you like stories of heros and hardships than you will love this book. This book tells an epic story of some kids living in the hood, and their troubles with life. They are constantly put down, and disregarded as inferior because of their name, GREASERS. Get to know these kids and you'll love this book."
3,The Outsiders,"Have you ever noticed that there are always those loved, perfect people, and yet there has to be those so called disguisting things that for some odd reason have to exsist, well, that is who S. E. Hinton likes to consider the ""outsiders."" As these group of people face some hard times throughout the past everything seems to go down hill once again. It's a hard life being a teen, but whoever really thought it to be this difficult just to survive. This book is filled with sorrow yet the perfect setting to help you with life. If you'd like to get the key point on how to ""stay gold,"" then don't hessitate, read this book."
3,The Outsiders,This book was a good book.It was a pretty said book. It made me want to cry through out the book.I think that many other readers would enjoy this book like I did. I recomand this book to people who like sad books.
3,It's ok,IM NOT GOING TO SAY I LOVE THE STORY IT'S KINDA LAME PONYBOY WAS REALLY OBNOXIOUS HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE BUT HIMSELF THE STORY IS NOT SO BAD I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE WHAT HIS OLDER BROTHER IS DOING FOR HIM HE WANT'S HIM TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNIES HE DIDN'T HAVE BUT PONYBOY JUST DOESN'T GET IT.
2,O.K. Not great!,"This book The Outsiders is about a group of kids living on their own. They are brothers. They are constantly picked on and called ""greasers"". They are the poor, low class kids and the high rich class kids are called ""socs"". They have nice cars and clothes and have money and good looks so they never get in trouble because the cops blame the ""greasers"" because of their looks. I liked this book because it has interesting things happening throughout the whole book. On a scale of 1-5, I will give it a 4."
2,Get real!,"The Outsiders was written by a teenager, can you believe it? And tell me just how can a teenager manage to create a whole book alone? I found this extremely boring. The beginning was quite interesting and I thought, 'oh, I've finally found a good book'. But towards the third chapter is started to drag me down a bit and the plot wasn't very clear. Then the end is just such a screw-up. I mean, it looks like S.E Hinton didn't have time to finish writing and just scribbled any old thing down. No offence meant to any readers who enjoyed the book!"
2,The Outsiders,"I thought that the book was ok , but I would not recomend it to my friends. It is about a yung man named Ponyboy who gets involved in a gang , and when him and another gang member get into trouble they have to run for their lives."
2,a unhelping scary story,I hated this book for a few resons first of all it was way to voilent it had alot of bloody parts this story is about all about gagers that are called grecers and that smoke to relakseand steal and after all of the talkes we had in school about not smoking or takin drygs we were practacly forced to read it for a book report
2,good book,"hi,um yeathis book is not very good, b/c it is boring b/c i dont like it and b/c i dont like to read. and also it is just boring and not a good book. so you people that like this book keep reading it but please shut up bout it. haha. thanks for reading this.goodbye*~Melissa~*oh yeadont forget,i have selective hearing. ( not really but the boss at work thinks so b/c she is annoying and does not know what she is talking about.)"
4,THE OUTSiDERS BOOK REViEW,"The author of this book was S.E Hinton and the title was The Outsiders. I would say that this book was a realistic fiction becuase it didn't happenbut, it could have. The theme of the novel I think was friendship and loalty.This book was filled with excitement. There were gang fights, murder, fires, runaways, and death. Once you get into this moving story, you can't get out.Not only is this book exciting it also has depth and has heart. This book shows how teenagers deal with the daily troubles of social groups. Teenagers can relate and parents will be intrigued. This book opened my eyes to a whole new world, hopefully it will touch you, too.I would highly recommand it for people of any age to dive into this novel about the crime of gangs."
5,The Outsiders,"This book is very interesting to me, because Iv'e never expierienced some of the things that the characters have been through. I love every single chapter because it is full of excietment!!! The reason why I give this book 5 stars,because I really like how the characters changed in the beggining to the end that was really good. I really hope to see the movie one day."
3,I love this book,"Some of the interesting parts in this book are really good. The charecters are: Ponyboy, Darry, Sodapop, Dally, Two-bit, Steve and Johnny. Ponyboy is the narrator and main charecter of the book. Darry and Sodapop are brothers of Ponyboy. Johnny is the other main charecter. He is abused by his parents and is the Greasers pet. Dally is the toughest greaser. Two-bit is the joker of the group. Steve doesn't really have a big role in the book. The greasers are constantly jumped by the Socs.There are a few lessons in this book. The first lesson is: stealing isn't breaking the law if your not caught. The second lesson is: fire hurts. The third lesson is: before you get in a fight make sure you feel ok.I really like the book. I would suggest that everyone read it. I like the book because of the fight. I like fight but I don't know why. I think a lot of people like fights but not real fights. This is a really good book and everyone should read it."
1,BORING,Our teacher made me read this book in class. I thought it was boring less and a waste of time. It was so boring that it took me three months just to finish the last chapter. I just read the last chapter on my summer vacation just out of curiosity. I'm glad Franciss Ford Copalla left out some parts of the book in the movie. My final thought is that this book was boring!
1,But.......,"This story is to much dark.I read all story,but there's no one's fun and happy.And this book,in killing story,narcotic.It looks like American crime story."
1,Outsiders,"The main character is Ponyboy. Ponyboy's best friend is Johnny. They are both greasers. One day they were in the park and a couple socs came and tried to drown Ponyboy. Johnny couldn't stand to see this happen so he stabbed Bob. Since Johnny was wanted for murder the only thing Pony and Johnny could do was run away, that's what they did while they waited for Dally (a greaser) to come rescue them. Pony and Johnny stayed in a church while they waited. They had to disguise themselves so Johnny and pony cut off their hair and Pony bleached his. Finally when dally came he took Johnny and Pony out to eat. When they were all done and they got back to the church, the church was in flames with a couple of children in there. Ponyboy and Johnny thought they were the cause so they went inside to save the kids... something bad was bound to happen."
1,Our book group voted 6 to 3 against the book.,"HOT DOGZ: A W-G BOOK GROUP gave this book a thumbs down. We didn't like it because it was far fetched, unbelievable, and we didn't like the pacing. We would rather read books about kids our own age. The people that liked the book thought Ponyboy was an unspirited and believable character and that author did a good job on the book."
1,If 0 Stars Was a Choice...,"Let me just say this a bluntly as possible: The book stunk. It seems to scream that violence and smoking is ok. In addition, no one can relate to the characters. They wear lots of hair gel and leather jackets. They beat people up. They smoke. They have weird names. Its one of those books that every teacher in the school is crazy about. However, maybe I shouldn't review the book. I didn't get past the fourth chapter, because I didn't want to suffer from a boredom attack. I reccomend this book to people who like senseless reading material. Do-mo. The End."
1,terrible,firzt thing i must say is gcgfddgshdhfhfhshshxhdbsbdhdhd thats what the book read like plain nonsense i rather go on pen island than read this the book is also inappropiate they talk about msturbation and smoking weed and to make sure you dont read it im going to tell u that johnny dies from a piece of wood that hits his back and dally dies from getting shot
3,The Outsiders,The book The Outsiders was a very good book. I liked it because it had a lot of fights in it. The best part was the rumble at the end. When the Greasers and the Socs fight. They Greasers always are running from the cops. They rob stores a lot to. The Greasers get bet up buy the Socs a lot. The chapters are long but they are easy to read. This is a good if you like fighting and running. The people in the book are like real people. My favorite person in the story is Soda.
4,The Outsiders,I think that the outsiders was a good book. I think that it could relate to kids in todays society. I dont think that this book is the best on ever written but i do think that it was a good book.
2,"This book is a carbon copy of ""West Side Story.""","I think that this book is alright. I would like something different than West Side Story, though. Most all of the books I've read this year are copies of the classics. I've heard that this book is a classic, but I've never heard of it!"
5,omg one of the best books!!!!!!!!!!,this is the best book and you have to readit and see the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you dont youll miss out on so much! i so highly recomend it. it portrays the life3 of a teen so perfectly its scary!11 btw my email is [...]if thers any Q's about the book!!!!!!!!1
5,The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton,"The Outsiders is an excellent book about growing up andacceptance. It is told from the point of view of a fourteen-year-oldboy in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during the early sixties. Ponyboy has lived with brothers Sodapop and Darry ever since his parents died. Sodapop dropped out of school and Darry turned down a scholarship in order to support themselves. They are a members of a gang of other hoods and juvenile delinquents, They and all other greasers are tormented by the Socs, an elite group of rich kids who's idea of fun is to jump greasers. Ponyboy considers his life pretty okay. But his life is turned upside-down when one night he and his best friend Johnny are confronted in the park by the Socs and somebody gets killed..."
5,This book kicked!,"I soo love this book! I read it like a month ago for the first time for my eighth grade english class, and I was amazed at how i had never bothered to read it before, that's how good I thought it was. I'm reading it for the third time right now, I seriously just can't get enough of it! I think I liked it so much because not only is the story line interesting, the book is incredibly well written. This book is very easy to get into and VERY hard to put down in the middle of it! This is kind of for a classic book report thing but I would not consider this a ""classic"" because the way I define classic is a very boring book that must be read just because its a classic and lots of people have read it. A normal classic I'll read once and say ""phew, at least I won't have to read it another time now that I know what it's about!"" This book is way different, I'll keep reading it over and over just because it's so GOOD! Definitely not what I expected. Read this book!"
4,I'm getting in to it!,it's ok im really getting in to it! it's about the poor side of town (greasers) and the rich side (soc). it's just about how young men are in this gang but it's not a gang it's a group / family kind of thing.It's a good book you should read it!
5,This book was writen in the 160's you will love this book,"I havn't finished reading it yet, but I love it alread"
4,Great Book,"This book made me think, made me cry and made me imagine. It's well written and it's obviously a classic. But I must admit I could tell it was written by a female. The tale is well crafted and most of the dialog is pretty good. However there are few lines that no young heterosexual boy would say to another. Which just gives away the fact that a woman wrote it. That is really the only gripe I have. The story is powerful and resonated with me. It's a timeless class struggle set in the most confusing years of a young man's life."
4,A Favorite!,"We once had to read this during literature class, and everyone in the classroom enjoyed it and the film based on it. The storyline, albeit it contains violence, is interesting and filled with action all while remaining in a basically normal setting, without any extraterrestrial beings from outer space or wizards or mythological creatures. However, the main reason why I felt the need to publish my opinion on Amazon.com was because a boy in my class who usually hated to read finally found a book that he enjoyed after reading this. It did not encourage him to read more, but he found a novel that interested him so that is definitely worth mentioning for anybody who knows a middle school student/reluctant reader. If you find yourself an acquaintance or relative of someone who, like my friend, dislikes reading, this is definitely for you."
5,Excellent!,I am the type of person who reads a lot. I have read several classic books like these. I never even heard of the Outsiders until my friend told me about it. So I thought I should read it. Well I began reading it and immediately fell in love with it. I thought that it stressed such an important lesson. It teaches you that good is always going to power over evil. This was a wonderful book and I think everyone should read it.
5,The Outsiders,"The part of The Outsiders that I remember most vividly is when Johnny bravely kills the violent Soc to save his best friend, Pony's life. After this incident, Pony and Johnny must go on a journey as fugitives to keep from getting caught by the police. This book has amazing suspense and unpredictable twists in plot. I now have a picture of how it would be like to lead a life as a gang member always on the run. An example of a unexpected twist is when Johnny and Pony and their friend Dally demonstrate how courageous and well intentioned they really are. They rescue children from a burning building after having been running from the police. Something suddenly happens to one of the greasers that leaves his friends shattered. This novel has a very painful and emotional impact, and has realistic descriptions and believable characters.By:Victoria S."
5,the best,My name is Josh Palmerio and I am twelve years old. My teacher recently read The Outsiders to us. It was great
5,DiS Be Da BoMb,This book is so amazingly cool that I recommend you put it in your basket or I might get the Greasers and Johnny's ghost after you!! This book deserves ***** and a 100%!! It is one of my favorite books along with the GIVER(tm
5,My favorite book of ALL time!,"I read this book 2 years ago when I was in the 8th grade. I never knew how much that book would touch my life. I read it ahead of what I was supposted to for an assignment because I simply couldn't put it down. This is the best book I have ever read, the movie isn't bad either!"
3,The Outsiders was not that good of a book but i lied in my report because it was eaiser,"The book the Outsiders by S.E. Hinton was a very good book. I think it is by far better than books wrote by people that were older. I will probably end up reading it jiagain because it is suicha good book.The book is very good for young teens. If they read it they might think differently about judging people. Becuase of this book there might be people who will ""stay gold"" londer by not scerwing up life.The book was good for the age of the author. She knew what she was talking about when shge wrote this book. She could probably realate to this book so that is probably where they got the idea from. The book was very good though.The book the Outsiders by S.E."
2,The Real Story,"In my opinion I personally thought the book was boring. All the book is about is this boy named Ponyboy,who all he does is gets in fights.The book really doesn't have a meaning."
1,reader,"An absoulutly horrible book. The plot is both much too violent and exceeds the bounds of beleivability. The characters range from absoultly fake in mannerism to outright sick, I beleive that the author his by far exceeded the bounds of good taste. For those who are fans of books that feature vast amounts of mindless violence presented in a most unsavory manner, I highly recommend this book. For anyone else, I must say that it would be best to leave this kind of book to those who fit the first description."
1,twas a grand dissappointment,"This book is about a young boy and all his friends back in the day. Back then, they were considered a gang, although nowadays, the concept is laughable. Anyway, this so-called ""gang"" is known as the greasers. They wore leather jackets and had greasy hair. This went back to the Happy Days years. There is also another ""gang"" called the socs, and they are rivals. The problem is, one day one of the greasers killed one of the socs. This book tells all about all the non-adventures of the greasers. Personally, it sucked big time, but notice how all the adults in this school seemed to like it. Probably because they were alive when people like this existed. So I suppose I should recommend it to all the adults alive in the 50s. This book wasn't up to my standards, seeing how there was extremely annoying characters and promotes smoking and beating people up. Not acceptable for flourishing young minds, but maybe for adults. I hope I never have to read it again in my life. Thank You."
1,Bad quality,Book was torn and page edges were jagged. Bad quality paper and printing. Looks like a pirated copy.
1,This Book Is The Greatest,"This book is the greatest for its characters,suspense, and detail.The reasons why this book has these things is because the author explians each characters feelings and physical features. There is suspense when the narrorator tells all the emotional fellings he is feeling and others are feelings."
1,The Outsiders,"Puffin, 1997, 180pgs, $6.99014038572The OutsidersS.E. HintonThis an exciting book about two gangs called the greasers and the socs. Ponyboy can count on his brothers to help him out when he is in a fight. Unil a fight happens. Something has gone wrong. What will Ponyboy do.It is a great book, and full of excitment. I would give it a 10 out of 10. Don't take my word for it, read it."
1,i hate it,i fell a sleep in class doin the outsiders book and now there makin me do this review about the book and i dont like it and i didnt like it or abomidible it was abomdible i cant spell ne ways bye bye i dont really read i ride dirt bikes ant im getting sponserd in the fall bye donald trump
3,The outsiders,This is a book for mature teen's. If you want to read a book read this book . This book is about teens in gangs and fighting among each other.
2,ugggg,"i hated this book. it was horrible. i had to read it for school and i was disgusted. sure it is suspenseful but it was horrible. you might have thought oh, whats gonna happen next?!?! but did you really care???? i kno i didn't."
2,I did not like it.,My favorte character in the book was Ponyboy because he had a chance in the future. My favorte part was when Ponyboy decided to save kids out of a fire. This showed great change in him. I did not learn a lesson in this book. It was basicly a copy off of WEST SIDE STORY AND ROMEO AND JULET. So if i am telling you if you are think of reading this DONT. Read ROMEO AND JULET which is a clasic story not a recopy. They are the same because there are two rival room. If you still want to read the story watch the movie instead. There the same thing.
4,Fear of the outside...,"This book- putting it as simply as possible- is amazing. The characters are all loveable in their own quirky way, the ending was amazing, and overall the book just seemed very realistic. I actually had to read this for school, and the night we were assigned to read Chapter 2 I just went and read half the book and finished the rest of it the next night...it's that good. If you're one of the 17 people in this country who hasn't read this yet- buy it and read it."
4,The Outsiders by S.E Hinton,""" How'd you like that haircut to begin just below the chin?"" This is a quote from The Outsiders by S.E Hinton. In the beggining of the book the main character known as Ponyboy is being mugged bt a group of rich kids known as the ""Socs.""The soc's are very cruel and try to mug Ponyboy, until Ponyboy's group also known as ""The Greasers"" come to his aid.One night Ponyboy and his close friend named Johny went out and in self-defense killed a soc. So now Johny and Ponyboy strugge to avoid the cops. This book had many turning points. In the begginig though, the book may seem a little slow, and does'nt really draw your attention.But as you get deeper into the book it changes ""dramitically"" so keep reading and don't give up.The author(S.E HInton) uses simple words and ocassionally you will find sophisticated words being used. I reccommend this book to 11 to 13 year olds that want to learn about kikds in gangs that had trouble growing up in a rough neighborhood."
5,Impressive Book,"This book is narrated by Ponyboy the main character. The events of the book deal with the conflict between the Greasers and the Socs, what caused changes in the gang, and the importance of friendship.To the people who have not read this book yet, you've got to read it. It really makes you think about you and your friends."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is the best book I have ever read.,"This is the best book ever! It talks about the problems in life and that predjudice solves nothing. This book has suspense, action, drama, and a good moral. I have read two others by Hinton, and I almost enjoyed them as much as this one."
4,The Outsiders,"""Stay gold ponyboy"" said Johnny to Ponyboy just before he died.Ponyboy lives with his two brothers. Their names are Darry and sodapop. Ponyboy is a 14 years old boy, which is in a click called ""The Outsider"" because he is the different one that likes to watch movies and read books. The Greasers, which are on Ponyboys side, they live on the eastside of town. The socs are the preps that live on the Westside of town and like to get in fights with the Greasers. The Greasers are mostly poor while the socs are the rich one that have nice up to date cars. Ponyboy Darry and Soda are brothers that have had to survive with out a mother or father. They go through a lot in this book and I think you will enjoy it. S.E Hinton did a good job with showing detail. It is a good class book with barely any boring parts so have fun and enjoy ""The Outsiders"""
4,The Outsiders,"Ponyboy Curtis is a almost average 14 year old boy. He goes to school and makes straight A's. He is living and learning to deal with being a greaser and living on what he calls the ""wrong side of town"". He also learns to deal with life and he learns to deal with lost of love ones through out this book. All though Ponyboy loses one his best friends, he will always remember to stay gold. I liked this book because the characters are real and teens can relate to them. I also like this book because it reminds me that no matter where you live,what you do,or who you are, things are rough all over."
3,The Outsiders,"This book was wonderful! It took a while to get to the main point of the story! But once it got to the main part i enjoyed it. This book can be based on a true story. Thats what i like about the book because a lot of people can relate to it. It was a sad book to, and some parts I would gaze off to the ceiling because it wasnt intresting to me or it did citch my eyes. but thats ok every book has that point in the story. I think your should read it!"
4,The Outsiders,"In a world of poor and rich, greasers and soc's; Ponyboy and his brothers are stuck in the middle. Together with his brothers Ponyboy learns that regardless of their social class pain hurts; even the Soc's just can't erase the pain even with their money. Knowing that they are too smart to be greasers, but too poor to be Soc's, they and their close friends stick together.All is well until one fatal night that tears them apart. Their lives will never be the same.I think S.E. Hinton did a wonderful job of elaborating the details and humanizing the characters.In think you will love the book. You don't find many good books about young boys trying to take control of their lives."
4,The Outsiders,"In Tulsa, Oklahoma their is a rivel between the gresers(poor kids) and the socs(rich kids)and ponyboy(his real name) is caught in the middle of it all.After his parents died that was when things started going into a major tail spin.As all of this is going on his friend (a fellow greaser) kills a person that was the last straw. They end up running from the cops and take some heroic actions.This book is manily about the gangs (the greasers from the east side) and ponyboys life when his parents die.It is a good book with lots of twists and turns and hatpounding excitment and I recimend it for teens."
4,The Outsiders,"This story depicts the ups and downs of life on the streets and on the west side of town.But the life of the people on the streets,known as the greasers, is ususally in a downward spiral. They are poor,jumped, beaten, and most dont know what life is like outside of their neighborhood. Ponyboy and his friends go through these hardships most of their lives. They are given the rough breaks that the Socs, who live on the west side,put on them.As the Socs and the greasers lives clash every day,they never expected what happened next.As the story progesses they begin to see how their lives are not so different.Because after all you can see the sunset on both sides."
5,Awesome book,This book was really good.I recomend it to readers from the age 12-16.It is about to gangs the Greasers and the Socs(soch-us).They lie fight steal.One day Ponyboy and Johnny the two youngest Greasers get to carried away in a fight.Just read the book and you will find what happends next.
4,The Outsiders,"The outsider is about two gangs who going against each other. That jumps each other. The charcter are Ponyboy, johnny, darry,soda-pop, dally, two-bit and steve.One lesson that I remeber form the outsiders is, when Johnny told ponyboy ""to saty gold"".Ts stay gold means to neveer change.i think that the outsider was the bset book i have read for a while. I think that this book is great for kids between 13 and 17 years old."
2,Too shallow in the detail section,"I guess I didn't think this book was so great. It is told from an interesting point of view, but the plot development was too shallow. The beggining is better than the end because there is more description and detail at the beggining. I don't know about other people, but from where I am, this book has no relation to present-day occurences, and I certainly can't relate to it at all."
4,"Not for Grade 3, age 8 !!! For Grades 9-12, age 14+","Okay, I haven't read it yet. However, I wanted to make note that this book is listed for children, grade 3, ages 8. It is not for that age group, but for high school level, grades 9-12, ages 14+.Thank you!"
4,The Outsiders,I think the Outsiders was a good book. It's about a little gang called the Greasers and they always fight another gang called the Soc's. It's a good book for ages 12-15 cause kids at that age always act like little Thugs and Homie G's. Well when I read the book I got interested in it and I don't even read books that much. I think everyone should read this book. It's all about a gangs life and how they live in a city. Next time you go to the library check this book out sometime.
4,The Outsiders,"I thought the Outsiders by S.E. Hinton was a great book. It was a little humorous and it showed realistic problems and how they're solved. But what I enjoyed most about the Outsiders is, it was a story of an everlasting friendship amoung adolesence. The Outsiders focused on two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. The main character, Ponyboy, is different from the rest and is kind of caught in the middle. Throughout the story their alikes and differences are expressed. I recommend this book for teens. I recommend it for teens because teenagers could relate to the issues these characters face. I really enjoyed this book and I know people who can relate to problems in the book will enjoy it also."
4,the book rocks,I think the book the outsiders is a really realistic book and it is like real live. But now it is preps and everyday people I am a everyday kid. The book has alot of fight an action. Ponyboy is a 14 year old kid that lives in a greaser neiborhood.His brother Sodapop and Darry . Darry is like the father of the house hold. I think that the rumble was well though out part of the book. But the part when Dally dies I though was not as well though out.
4,A STORY WRITTEN FOR ALL AGES,"The Outsiders is a story written by S. E. Hinton for all ages. Ponyboy, the protagonist, lives situations maybe a normal boy never lives, and because of that, he, his two older brothers and his gang learns to see things from a different point of view. The gang and all of the Greasers, how the boys living in the same area as Pony are called, have a lot of problems with Socs, the rich boys. Because of one incident with some Socs, life changes completely for our characters, and since that moment, he has to decide staying there and do not do anything, or keep moving. Definitely, a very good story with a lesson to take and a message to get for all of us."
5,"Hmmmm, I'll grab that!","That's what I thought when I saw my daughter reading this classic for an English assignment. I've read this book too many times to remember so, I read it yet again the minute she left the house! An all time classic which will always be a part of a schools reading list in my opinion. This tale is about a group of teenagers who are growing up in less than perfect conditions. The story is narrated by 'Ponyboy' who feels there are only two groups of people in the world. Soc's and Greasers which he is. He tells a tale that leaves you teary eyed. Mum's, if you kids bring this book home from school and you've never read it, grab it!"
4,One of the Best Books I've Read,"The Outsiders is an exciting book for young adults and older children. It is about a ""greaser"" who is learning how to deal with his life, which gets worse and worse throughout the book. It seems like all the people he knows and relies on die in a very short period of time. Although so many people die, the book still has a great outcome. I would tell you, but.... I don't want to ruin it for you. Enjoy your reading!"
4,The Outsiders !,"The Outsiders ! All the characters change from having bad attitudes to having loving and caring by the end of the story. Some characters include (Ponyboy,Darry,Twobit,Sodapop.)When Bob was killed Pony found out that all the greasers and socs where all the same except for clothes,their long hair,and cars.When Johnny died Ponyboy and Darry became closer than before and now they love each other more than ever.When Dally died they all became closer because it made them appriciate all the people that are left. When the church burned down Pony,Johnny,Dally,and even Sodapop became closer and learned they had some good in their life for once.So nomatter what happens friends are important in your lifetime.Even if they are bad !!! they can comfort you and give you support and help you to stay strong .So stay in there and never give up and stay golden like Johnny told Ponyboy .!!!"
3,Fun Xmas Rock and Roll Novelty,"This bargain-priced CD contains half the material from the Fab Four's previous holiday-themed collection. All the songs on the CD combine traditional holiday songs with Beatles references, as you would expect from a Beatles cover band.The results are pretty good; I particularly enjoyed the Norwegian Wood stylings of ""Silent Night"" and the McCartneyesque ""The Christmas Song."" On other songs, the combination is a bit strained, and ""Rockin Around the Christmas Tree"" is seriously damaged by the inclusion of synthesised horns rather than a real horn ensemble.Still, the price is right, and if you're already inclined to purchase Xmas CDs you will definitely get a kick out of this one."
4,Fabulous Christmas,Awesome for Beatle fans. Very very interesting and clever way of making your favorite Beatle tunes Christmas songs.
3,Not As Fun as the Other One,"I'd recommend their other Xmas CD first-I skip many more on this one.Although ""Santa Claus is Comin to Town"" ala ""When I'm Sixty Four"" and ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree"" ala ""Got to Get You into My Life"" are classic.Correcting the correction about ""Dear Santa"": It is SO a Ringo tune, found on his ""I Wanna Be Santa Claus"" CD."
5,"Beatles fans, rejoice!","This is a fab, fun record for all Beatles fans that applies song structures, instrumentation, harmonies, etc. from real Beatles songs to traditional Christmas carols. The Jingle Bells/Tomorrow Never Knows track alone is worth the price."
5,Best gas cooktop available,"After months of research we closed on the DCS Gas Cooktop. We looked at Thermador, Viking, Dacor and others and arrived at the Fisher/Paykal DCS. The simmer mode is outstanding, temp control is great, grates are great :)Overall this has been an outstanding cooktop. Removing the grates for cleaning can be a bit of a problem, as they hook into each other, but apart from that the cook top has enhanced our cooking tremendously. Clean up is easy, the knobs are sturdy, high heat is fantastic and the aesthetics rock!!"
4,Good Seller.,"Failed to mention it was an Instructors Review copy but as soon as I emailed them, they offered a refund. Great communication and a very compromising seller. Thanks."
5,It came fast,"It came quick! A couple of pages had bent corners but other than that, the book was in great condition!"
2,Informative but WAY over-priced!!,"Yes, the information in this ""kit"" is informative and the sample forms are good ones, but for ($) give me a break! I've bought books on the same subject with just as valuable information for half the price and triple the length! Find it used if at all possible!"
1,Very disappointing,"This book was extremely overpriced for the information offered. Basic information, and not overly inspiring. There must be much better books out on the market regarding petsitting for a much more reasonable price. Research them further before buying this one."
3,had to return,"I have used the unflavored Natural Calm for several years now. I thought I would buy this one because I usually add stevia anyway, but apparently one of the added ingredients gave me a headache, so I had to return it."
5,Really happy with this line,Bought a case to use for parties (we entertain a lot) and LOVE this product line. Sturdy (though not great for really saucy stuff as it absorbs) and you feel like you aren't filling the landfills with non-biodegradable stuff quite as much...
1,disappointed...,"I've used this for about a year now. It is my second headlamp, but now I need a third. I got back from camping last weekend and noticed that my headlamp had broken into pieces and is unrepairable. I think I'm going to buy a Petzl."
3,Great for Wang Tao Fans,I am a Wang Tao fan and I love this movie. The fighting has a great style to it and the picture is clear. The story is great except one section that was a bit confusing. You will recognize some other exellent actors like Lo Leih from (five fighters of Death) and Meng Fei from the (Prodigal Boxer). And 2 good looking ladies. One of the ladies star on (Ninja Massacre)as a bling fighter.
3,Good movie but not thrills,"This movie is about a rebel swordsman that is wanted dead by the kinghe sends assassins and his army out to do this, along the way the swordsman meets David Changs character and together they fight to over throw the king. The fight scenes are good, the story line is typical, this is an easy to watch film not something unbarible not no were near David Chiangs usual performance but good thats it."
3,geared for men!,"I bought the cds to brush up on my conversational French for an upcoming trip. While they have been helpful in reminding me of French rules and quirks, I realized about halfway through the cds that they appear geared primarily for American businessmen looking to make conversation, as it were, with French women. I am dispapointed that so much time is focused on asking ""Mademoiselle"" if she would like to have a drink, when, and where, and less on basic conversation with vendors, hotel staff, and restaurant staff. In light of the fact that more women are working here and abroad, it seems to me that the conversation could be updated to reflect more current (or timeless) conversational trends!"
2,Good if you already know some French,This is difficult to understand if you do not already have some knowledge of French. It would be easier if there was a visual to go along with the CD's. The first lessons do not seem to deal with things you need to know if you are visiting France.
1,Just painful.,"I got this after reading glowing reviews, but really just can't stand it. I had listened to an old series of cassette tapes I really liked and hoped this would be as good - it isn't. What you get here (and in all the other methods I've tried recently) is lessons in how to TRANSLATE from English - which is not at all what I want to do. I want to SPEAK FRENCH. Switching back and forth between English and French and English and French makes my head hurt. I think maybe Rosetta Stone is a full immersion course, but I can't afford it."
2,waste of time for some 'pick-up' lines,"8 hours of cd's, and a nice bonus cd holder...and you will learn about ten different pick-up lines (or, how to recognize that the woman does *not* want to go for a drink with you). After 8 hours of (granted, well-articulated) repetition, you will have the phrases down pat, but it's an awful lot of time spent to only be equipped with enough phrases to get some mythical French woman to go out with you...and then have nothing further to say to her. I'm afraid I highly regret this purchase...even at a quarter of the price I would feel the same. Not to mention the hours of listening, hoping it might somehow get better. It didn't."
3,Convenient to use and easy to transport,"Pimsleur's Conversational French CDs are very easy to use and convenient. We keep them in the car because we are there often. Everyone joins in repeating the phrases. Most of the sentences are ones that you would use in getting about a French speaking area. However, I would have liked having a written booklet with it, because it is difficult to determine b or v and some other pronunciations. On the whole I feel it is worth the reasonable we paid for it. The lessons progress from one to the other so that there is a continuity in learning."
2,Sad !!!!!,"The conversations are brilliant along with the drill. However there is no written transcripts for you to verify the spellings or the subtleties of pronunciation, and very often the tense changes with a minor twist in pronunciation, which our non french ears may not be able to decipher. Considering the high cost of the package the company should have included the transcripts, maybe in a soft form.The other thing is that grammar is not really explained during the course. Its more rote learning. I would strongly recommend the 10 CD Michel Thomas method along with the Advanced course. Not only are the transcripts there, but the tenses and grammar are explained very well, as well as its far cheaper."
3,Good,"This is a good program, like all the Pimsleur products. However, I don't think it is as good as either Spanish or Italian. It is more limited in the way French is expressed in conversation.This product is designed to get you to respond automatically in conversational situations it covers. It is not designed to give you much of a vocabulary or grammar, so a rating should not be penalized for not including them. Many other products give you what Pimsleur lacks, and are readily available on Amazon. I suggest Living Language products for vocabulary, situations, good pronunciation."
3,Maybe it's just me...,"This set of CDs was purchased to help us learn 'just a bit of French' prior to our upcoming trip. Unfortunately, it seemed too difficult for us and far too extensive - maybe the problem is us and not the CDs."
2,Repeat repeat repeat ad nauseum,"I was really disapointed with this set of CDs having read that Pimsleur was the best way to learn French. It's so repetitive and after 30 minutes I jumped ahead to the final CD to see if progress was ever going to be made. Admittedly by the final CD you have learnt a little French, but at what price, hour after hour of boring reptitive lessons. I've also bought the Michel Thomas series, which I find much more enjoyable. In that series you feel part of the class and that you are moving along quickly and I look forward to making time for the lessons.I wouldn't recommend this one. I'd suggest using Michel Thomas instead."
2,Got to be an easier way?,"I followed the instructions and made my way through the 8 cds. However, once I got to Paris, I'd forgotten nearly everything I'd spent months repeating every day to and from work. The greetings were helpful but most of us know how to say hello and goodbye in French. I did like how the lessons built on one another and the instructors had pleasing voices.Marie Estorgeauthor of STORKBITES: A MEMOIRand CONFESSIONS OF A BI-POLAR MARDI GRAS QUEENStorkbites: A Memoir"
5,A great toy for a little girl,"My grand-daughter is just turning 3 and LOVES ballet-arinas! She likes dressing in a tutu herself, and these sturdy, board book-type cut-outs are just the ticket for a little one with little motor skills. She cannot tear the doll or the dresses, but can dress her over and over again to her hearts delight."
5,Magnetic ballerina dress up,"Easy for small child to use, and change clothes again and again. Also, very sturdy. It will last a longtime."
3,My girls love these dolls!,"These dolls are great for my daughters, this toy actually holds their attention for up to 45 minutes! The pieces are small and easy to lose, but other than that this is a fun toy!"
4,My 3 year old daughter loves this toy!,"My 3 year old absolutely loves dressing up this wooden ballerina with magnetic dress-up pieces! She'll sit quietly and dress her up in one outfit after another. I just wish it came with a lid for storage. But other than that a great, durable toy!"
4,Great toy,"My 3 year old niece loved this, she even got her dad involved in dressing the ballerina. Its something like a puzzle in the outfit has to fit together."
4,Balrenia doll magnetic review,"It was a great toy. My granddaughter loved it. I wish their was a cover on the box, so you wouldn't loose any pieces."
3,"great toy, no lid","great toy - we've had it for a few weeks and work on matching and pretend play, but not terribly educational beyond that. regardless, i admire the pleasant body image and in general love M&D! just really really really wish it came with a lid. we'll be ditching the box it comes in, which is actually a really nice box, and putting it in something else to keep all of the pieces together. there are a handful of tiny (choking-hazard) pieces that we've removed completely, as baby brother puts EVERYthing in his mouth."
5,Surprise hit!,We bought this for a 3 year old and both she and her 5 year old sister love it! They love dressing the doll up and playing with all the pieces. I thought they might like it but had no idea how much they would enjoy it. I have it on the list to now buy for my own daughter for her birthday.
4,magnetic dress-up doll,"This toy is loved by my 4 year old daughter. We have both the Princess and the Ballerina dolls so we can play with them together. Lots of fun changing their outfits, and easy to do. The only downfall is that there is no lid or top to put on when done so pieces can easily fall out and get lost. I wish I had known that before I purchased. I do love the little stand that help the dolls stand up making it more fun to play with."
3,Cute toy. Buy a container to keep the pieces together.,Cute toy that my daughter loves. TONS better than the paper dolls I played with when I was young. My only complant is that the box has no lid. I have pieces all over. Buy a plastic container and you will be fine.
5,Melissa & Doug Deluxe 27-Piece Nina Ballerina Magnetic Dress-Up,My 6 year old grand daughter loves to play dress up and this is a perfect travel toy for her.
2,Stick With His Other Books,"While this book was okay, I was kind of disappointed. It seems to just be rehashed articles from the author's previous two books, Roadside NJ and Jersey Diners, without all of the great pictures that originally accompanied them. I would recommend buying one of those books, which are still published by Rutgers University Press, rather than this one."
1,Obviously a problem,"Amazon obviously has a problem with this item. Even after talking to Customer Relations before I purchased this, the WRONG items came. 8 Place settings of the WRONG pattern. The return was a little bumpy, but it finally got returned. Now I see that it's not currently available. I wish they said that before. Very disappointing Amazon performance this time."
1,Disappoint,"I bought this filter directly from Amazon.com and I received a damaged item.Big crack in the filter container and scratch on the filter surface due to very poor packaging , Amazon sent it in soft envelope instead of box as you can see from uploaded picture.Filter is made in CHINA and poor QC as I can see some imperfection on glass itself (not scratch).I will definitely return this damaged item."
3,"One year later, the blade is shredding","Bought this for the 2010-11 snow season. We got slammed up here in the NE, and my little house on the hillside was constantly buried. It stood up well during that first winter's use (and it got some hard use here!) When we put it away for the season, the shovel looked in great shape, especially given the abuse. Not a crack to be seen.But now one year later, the plastic blade is just disintegrating. I've used it twice, and the edge has cracked and shredded more each time. I don't know if it got too hot in my garage tool rack, but it just won't make another snow fall, never mind another season.Other than the blade's durability issue, we really liked this shovel. The steel handle really stood up to pushing some heavy, wet snow (the handle is STILL in excellent shape, not a dent or bend anywhere) and overall it was very light-weight and easy to use. Not for use chipping ice of course, but can really take a heavy load of snow."
4,Looks are deceiving,"Though at first glance this shovel looks flimsy, it is actually very durable. With huge volumes of ice and snow this past winter, I used the shovel with very rough handling, pushing and banging my way through ice crusts with absolutely no complaints from the shovel. My comments apply to both the push and non-push version of the Ames True Temper shovel."
2,well,"I am a little upset about the vocals pn this dvd. It does not even come close to the album ""river runs Red"". The music is not bad."
3,Ok - not enough songs from river runs red,"when you go to a live rock show, you want to party and get your fans wilded up, not put them to sleep. This dvd expands their whole disography, but shys away from river runs red, the concert sags in the middle to the point of the worst song ive ever heard by this band, is it called tangerine? dumb! i think it was songs liek these that shows why this band faded away with time. Anyway, It has aenough heavy stuff on it to make it worth buying, although, like myself, you might think something is missing. Deffitly would a good qaulity dvd, just a little boring in spots."
4,Life of Agony is Back,"Life of Agony is back and all original members.I have been a fan since The River Runs Red album.I have to disagree with a reviewer on here whosaid they like the second album ""Ugly"" better.This reviewer also said it was heavier.River runs red was the heaviest album theyever recorded.All my friends who like the bandeven agree that River runs red is their bestand heaviest album ever.Although I have not seen the DVD yet,butI am sure it's worth buying.I do not like Life of Agony with outthe original singer.Life of Agony isbetter off being all original.They arestill young and they have so much moreto offer.I think this will not just be areunion tour but hopefully they will notbreak up again and continue making mucic.I rated this DVD 4 starts because I'm sureit's a great DVD,even though I haven't seenit yet."
5,Great Oil Filer,I purchased this oil filter for my motorcycle after I couldn't get the old one off without vice grips. It went on easy and think it will be much easier to get off of the motorcycle. Great price here on Amazon too!
5,Fascinating for people interested in sign painting,"This is fun, has lots of drawings. Some of the paint chemistry info in it is probably too old to be true, but some of it still holds. The basic info on sign lettering is great!"
3,Not bad,"I enjoyed the adventure thd couple went through in this book. I was decently entertained. However the end of the book.., eh. Got totally unrealistic. I mean. I know it's a romantic fiction but a dash of realism in necessary."
4,Great TV set,"I'd been holding off on buying a second television set until I felt the technology I wanted had become a bit less expensive. What a pleasure it was to find a television set that not only met this criteria but offered better than expected picture and sound.This set sounds and looks great. I easily hooked it up to a three speaker system and have been enjoying dvds, cds, etc. Again, this is a great second television; I highly recommend this product."
4,A New Version by Colin Teevan,"I like this version a lot - it's full of energy, and very exciting to see in person, which I was lucky enough to do. But it's NOT the Peer Gynt you might be familiar with, or the one you want to pick up if you're looking for a more standard translation. While this one is true to the story and the characters, there's a lot of updating and a lot of language that might offend people who don't like the kinds of words you can't say on radio and TV. It's more of an interpretation than a translation.If you want a more standard version, I like this one."
4,Not bad for the price.,"It is still too soon to really tell, as I have had it for only a month. If you are looking for an inexpensive DVD Player that plays store purchased and home burned DVDs this is the only one for you. It has a lot of features that the more expensive DVD Players have. Progressive Scan and 5.1 Channel Audio etc. Awesome picture and excellent sound. It is no bigger than a telephone book. If it lasts a year it would worth the price tag of $ 39.99. Remember you get what you pay. I since purchased two more for backup. A very good product by COBY. I love it."
1,No more Coby,"First, it appeared a remote not to work. I drived back to the shop and changed it. If you think that it is the end of story you are wrong. The remote function still did not work. But I checked the remote at the shop and it worked! So, I drived back again having the whole DVD set with me. Shopmen did not look too happy but they changed the whole DVD-player.Do you think it is the end of story? No, you are wrong! I enjoyed DVD just a week then it stop reading DVD disks."
3,"""WRONG DISC"" = DEATH","Its 11:30 pm. I just watched about half of CASINO ROYAL. When I'll get to watch the rest... who knows. The player stuttered, then froze. I took the DVD out and cleaned it. Replaced it, and after trying to load for a bit it gave me a ""wrong disc"" message. Tried again. No good, hmmmm. Tried another disc and got the same thing. Welcome to reality. I've had it over a year and watched a good 100 or so movies on it, with only a few disc related problems. How can I complain after paying only $25 for it at the grovery store (first clue). I can't comment much on other formats although Its played a few home recored CDs okay. After reading the other reviews on here, I think I've fared better than most. Diagnosis: ITS TOAST"
1,Piece of Junk. Buy the Philips DVP1013 instead,"This DVD player is a piece of junk. It works maybe 50% of the time. You can sometimes spend 5 minutes opening/closing the tray before it'll accept the disk. It was also recommended as multi-region by some users. Well, it won't play any of my region 2 disks. I've tried all the hacks found online but nothing seems to work. I figure that there's probably a couple of different releases of this unit on the market with different firmware versions, one of which will allow multi-region. I just replaced it with a Philips DVP1013 which worked first time (after inputting the region hack). I will never buy anything from Coby again. I only give it 1 star because Amazon won't let me choose zero."
2,Worst remote control ever.,"This is lightweight, which is good. It plays most (not all) of the CD/DVD types that it claims to, and does a pretty good job with them, with occasional skipping issues...But the remote control is the WORST. You have to press the keys incredibly hard to get them to work at all, and if you're not within three feet of the device you have to press the keys more than once.I would avoid this, unless you already have a programmable remote control. If so, throw away the remote that comes with it and use your own. You'll spare yourself strained fingers and muttered curses."
2,Stay Away from Coby Products,Do not waste your time buying this DVD player!!! I am serious!!! I've had this thing for couple of months and now it just wont work. I guess you get what you pay for!!! The screen is jumping up and down and there is no more color. I have tried everything and it still doesnt work!!! What a piece of junk and waste of money!!! Do not waste your money on Coby products!!! They seem promising at first but then couple months later doesnt even work!!!...Dont even think twice about this product!!!
1,Coby DVD-514 Super Slim 5.1 Channel Progressive Scan DVD Player,"The flexbility of formats made this seem like a great gift for my mother overseas. However it is cheaply constructed and stopped reading disks after 3 or 4 successful uses. A friend who's a digital video expert looked over the unit and told us it's not worth repairing. Due to the delay from purchase to use, the warranty was already void, so my mother opted to buy a different device locally instead."
4,Good and Cheap,"I bought this DVD player a couple of months ago, and it works great. It's set at a good price, which is great for college students like myself. I really enjoy this product."
3,Remote not as shown,"I specifically did not want one of those credit card size, flat, non ergonomic remote controls. My thought is that the DVD would be used in a darkened room, and I do no want to have to turn on a light to read a DVD and try to use those tiny buttons. As soon as I opened the box and saw the remote control, I sealed the box and sent it back. I talked to Amazon.com and they saw the mis-representation and were very apologetic about it. I returned it immediately. Perhaps by now, the onsite picture has been corrected."
1,was a present & it's evil!,"This thing actual scratches my DVDs! I have to hit it to make it unfreeze (which my toddler thinks is funny, but I don't). It's getting worse all the time! I've been toughing it out because it was a present and plays VCDs. (and I'm poor) I'm tired of it. This thing is actually an expense the way it damages DVDs!"
3,Hit & Miss,"I bought one of these suckers in the summer of 2006 because my name-brand DVD player would not play my 'archive' copies of DVDs. Well, it did play them......for a few hours. Then it just stopped working altogether. Took it back to the store and exchanged it for the same one.As for that one, well, it lasted until the spring of 2011, when it just stopped reading discs. So, I gotta agree with some people who have had problems with these right out of the box. But on the other hand, my second one did last almost five years. So I guess it just depends on luck. Will you get a crappy one or a dependable one? Make sure wherever you buy it from, they have a good return/exchange policy. If so, take the risk. It's cheap and plays pretty much ANYTHING you put into it. I'm actually going to buy another one. Tried a GPX. Worst electronics brand...EVER."
1,May be good only for DVD movies,"I bought this device as my first DVD player, used to work fine. Then i bought a Sony Home Theater and left this as my CD/MP3 player (music only) but it only plays some CD-R disks, i dont know if there is a special way to burn the disk in order the COBY can play it.If you are looking only to play movies, this will do it. If you plans to use it as a multi format player, you better spend a little more and buy at least a Phillips"
4,4 months and going,"I bought this player in January,I read all the reviews, and thought I'd go for it.There was allot of NEG reviews on this player. but for theprice *and free shipping, It was worth the chance.Well It's been 4 months now, The player see's about 4 moviesa week on it. No odd sounds, no broken up video, no misreadingof the dvds as DVR's or anything else. The Unit is running great!With no hang up's at all.The only odd thing about this players I found was,The remote shown is not the remote you get.The one you get is very small, and it takes a bit to get use to.But other than that it works fine..I'll update, as the months pass.."
2,Limited But Cheap,"1. Does not work with Universal Remote.2. You have to quickly double-click the buttons on the remote for any response. Response is still slow. Some of the remote control layouts are counterintuitive.3. If I had paid retail I would have asked for my money back, but I paid $24 new in a bargain bin; it's OK as a seconday DVD, got what I paid for."
5,COBY MINI COMPONET DVD-514,"Small Compact Componet DVD Player....Performs great. Setup easy and fast. Plays all formats. Clear bright picture. The blue back ground display displays a pink kinda numerical-graphic display, back counter and graphic notation of the disc turning. I had no problems installing and placing 514 in with other componets. The only problem was linking the 514 to my tv monitor. Extra length jumpers here. All and all a great dvd player. For the budgeted a great purchass. The 514 is now being used in completing a display with video. Most nice. Runs almost six hours, five days a week.TELEMETRY DATA SYSTEMS La Jolla California"
1,Maybe I Got A Lemon!,"I may have been the one in a thousand buyers, but I had to return this item after getting about 10 minutes of normal Play operation and then it froze up. After I tried all the trouble-shooting procedures in the Owner's Manual, all I could get was a very long ""Loading"" message followed by a ""Wrong Disk"" message. I then tried five different DVDs that I knew were working O.K. on my other DVD player with the same results. Thank goodness that I ordered this product through Amazon.com and was able to return it for a full refund/no postagecharge. All I lost was two hours of fruitless trouble-shooting time!"
1,Awful,I received this DVD player for a Christmas gift. I used it 5 times and it has not worked since. Between my Mother and I (she is the one that gave it to me) we couldn't find the receipt to return it. I called the place she purchased it and they would have returned it but no longer had any in stock. The manager made it very clear that alot of them had been returned for the same exact issue-reading disk error. So here I sit with this DVD player that doesn't work at all and yet it is just like new. I thought Coby was a decent brand but I guess not.
1,Not up to par,"I purchased it with the hopes of playing some recorded DVDs, picture DVD's, and just plain old regular DVD's. I had troubles with all, but oddly even the Regular store bought DVD would pause, skip, and delay. I spoke to a ""guru"" and he said that sometimes with the ""less expensive"" DVD players, the lense or eye isn't very steady or good quality and can cause that problem. With the less expensive, you don't have quite the consistancy - some work fine and others are junk. A little Russian Roulette. Anyway, I returned it and ended up purchasing a slightly more expensive model."
1,False and misleading title!!,"This book, while titled and marketed as a study guide for the ESE test, appears to be the study guide for the old Emotionally Handicapped FTCE test (no longer used) with a new cover. In fact, the table of contents pages as well as the title page all indicate that the book is for the ""Emotionally Handicapped"" test.Furthermore, I was disturbed to see misspellings, unfinished sentences, and poor grammar. This should NEVER happen in any publication sold to the public, but especially it shouldn't happen in a TEACHERS' STUDY GUIDE that cost $30!!And finally, the title page promised a bibliography and sources were cited throughout the book. There was no bibliography included, however; and therefore no way to find the full citations for the sources mentioned.I believe it is false advertising to market this book as a study guide for the ESE test when it so clearly is a study guide for the EH test with a new cover."
5,a must for cat UTI,"I found this online and ordered for my poor cat that was suffering from unexplained UTI. I got it very quickly and since I've used it she doesn't have them anymore. Knock on wood!!!I feel it helped with her suffering and the pain. I would give her a tiny teaspoon of a good wet cat food and mix the pellets right in. She always downs it, no problem.I recently stopped using it as she has been better for 3 months. I do always keep a bottle of this handy just in case."
3,Insufficient,"Outdated and insufficient. But a good beginner book that covers the basics. I would suggest buying one of the bigger more expensive books, but if this is all you can afford, it is worth the money."
3,Get the full album instead!,"This is a short CD version of a great album by the same name. Get the full album instead! The complete ""I Am Shelby Lynne"" is one of my favorite albums of all time."
4,Absorbing--I recommend it,"I read this Edith Maxwell book in the 1980s, though the characters are clearly living in the 1970s. The plot: A prank phone call inadvertently causes the deaths of two people and orphans a teenage girl. This terrible secret is kept by four friends as one of them befriends the girl and guilt and fear erodes the friendships of the four. I think if you've read Lois Duncan's ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", then you'll probably enjoy this book, too."
3,Probably won't know you out,"Well, as most people know, either you love KMFDM or you hate them. Also, most fans know that you probably have to be a big fan to admire their older work. Virus is a good single, considering its age and that there are three other songs and not just one hundred million versions of the title track.The other songs aren't all that great, but Virus is such a great track, I think it's worth it. Like I said, it is a very primitive piece of KMFDM's work, but it's a keeper for collectors.If you're just getting in to KMFDM, try Angst, NIHIL or the self titled album first. Most fans work their way backwards."
4,No title just want to say my piece,I'm going to disagree with the first guy. This Single has rare tracks that you can't find anywhere else. The Virus track is the original song and so is the More & Faster track. Buy this CD if you want to be like me.
5,Song: Icaro E Giulia,"The most beautiful Italian song ever sung! I've sent this CD to all my relatives and best friends for Christmas. Massimo di Cataldo's voice is a gift from heaven. Buy it, you'll never forget how it makes you feel!"
5,SUPERB VOICE!!!,"I Love this CD. I prefer the remixes but the original is fantastic too. Miss Cox can really sing and she sang it all out. The remix is powerful and carries her voice superbly. Better than the remix of ""Who Do You Love""."
4,Bee Pollen Plus,I now float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!Not to mention what this has done for my libido.The price is right and shipment was prompt.
2,Texas Rattlesnake,"The Texas Rattlesnake is a story about Stone Cold Steve Austin's life. His name when he was born was Steven Anderson. His father left him, so he took his stepfather's last name. It is mostly about his career in wrestling.I think this book is good if someone likes wrestling. If Stone Cold actually said anything to the author, the book may have been better. It is a good book to me, but some people might not like it."
2,Have seen better border resources,"Compared to ""Border Workbook: Easy Speed Pieced and Foundation Pieced Borders"" by Janet Kime, this book isn't anywhere near as good."
5,Amazing,It works perfect on polished brass faucet of 15 years. Save cost to replace faucet. Will buy again. Wish more people aware this product
4,tv,we boght this TV to upgrade to a bigger living room Tv and Wow. im amazed at the picture quality and the way it sounds when i play a DVD. with 3 av hookups it made hooking all the game systems / dvd player etc. a lot easier than removing one to hook another.
3,Charlaine Harris fan,"Bought this collection of stories for the Sookie Stackhouse selection. Unfortunately, that was really the only one I enjoyed. Started several of the others, but was not caught up. Enjoyed the Sooke story very much,though."
2,book still not here.,i'm excited to read the book but have yet to receive it and it was ordered approx. 2 weeks ago. wish it was here...
2,Let's be real,"I don't even know why Hamilton put that piece of crap in the novella, but thank God for Davidson and Knight's work. They are both a little clunky and not nearly as good as anything else they've written but they cover up the smell of rotting corpses coming from the Anita Blake novella. The last one by the new girl was pretty interesting, but I doubt I'd buy anything else from her. Was it a waste of $7.99 - without a doubt - yes!"
2,Compilation Books Are Terrible,"I am not a fan of these compilation novels. To me, it seems that all of the crappy stories or ""cut"" scenes end up in the book and I usually end up feeling ripped off. I wouldn't recommend this novel or ""Cravings."""
2,Don't Buy This Book,"I was highly disappointed in the anthology. Each story read like the first twenty pages of a chapter..before the editors put their hands on it. Anthologies of this nature usually leave you wanting to read more by the author. Had I not known the capable writing of Charlaine Harris previous to this concoction, I would NEVER buy her stuff. These EXTREMELY short stories didn't even inspire a desire to read upcoming books by the authors even if you are familiar with the characters and their worlds. A word of advice...read this book in the bookstore. It will probably take 20 minutes and you could save 7 bucks."
2,Returned book & got money back - only 2 new stories,"Pages 1-58 are two new stories. The rest of the book are stories that were published years ago and slightly modified so that they could have a 2005 copyright. If you are widely read, 200 pages of old stories will be a major disappointment.Also, I wouldn't judge any of the individual authors based on what is in the book. The editing appears to be significantly different than what is normal.Try the anthology ""Dates From Hell"" instead of this one. Much better writing and editing!"
4,A bit of a mislabel.,"I anticipated this book eagerly and was sadly disappointed to find that the ""new Anita Blake story"" was less than 35 pages of the nearly 300 total pages. I actually really liked the whole book, but the misrepresentation leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. I know marketing, that doesn't mean I have to like it.Overall, I'd recommend this book, but I'd -also- recommend that you don't get TOO excited about new stuff from your favourite authors. The last two authors (who I hadn't heard of or previously read) got the bulk of the book."
1,UGH..............,It was not what I expected.... the stories were way to short. But the delivery was quick.
2,Very little BITE in this anthology,"Great cover - made me pick this book up.And though I am a Hamilton fan, this was but a tiny tidbit and merely whetted my appetite. Disappointed in the whole book. Though there are a few good moments in the ""otherworld"" fantasy, there was very little romance, all in all. Too bad, since Berkley puts out some really BITEY stuff usually."
2,Nothing worth sinking your teeth into,"I'm definitely a fan of Laurell Hamiltons earlier works so I enjoyed her story. However, Charlaine Harris, in my opinon always leaves something to be desired. MaryJanice Davidson alternates between amusing and annoying with the childish antics that go on between the vampire couples. Did NOT enjoy Angela Knights' story-too much sex, not enough substance. Still for a bit of fluff when you're totally bored it might be worth picking up. But i recommend the library so you can spend your money on one worth keeping."
3,A bit disappointed with the veterians,"I'm not an anthologies fan. I read fast, so the bigger the better provided it's good. The first three short stories by Hamilton, Davidson, and Harris was a huge disappointment. I have read ALL these ladies books. There was nothing there to capture me. The last two were a little longer and I found myself much more interested.Angela Knight wrote a short story intitled ""Galahad"" I thought was great. It was a whole new world and concept on the grail. I liked Vicki Taylor's short story, too. A guy wants to become a vampire to get back at a vampire that took everything from him, even his fiance'. I've never read anything from these two authors, so I'll definitely look into them."
3,Bite,"pretty good read, if your into the vampire thing it will keep your interest. some of the stories are a little too short but other than that. it was good."
5,great reading~!,"If you like any one of these authors, you will love this book.Great short stories if you are into supernatural fiction, or just want something fun to read."
2,Hit or Miss,"The product itself doesn't seem too bad, but the assembly seemed like it should have been much simpler. None of the holes lined up and I had to force fit the pieces. It's a little banged up now but works fine. I'd rather keep it after all the work I had to put into it then have another one sent and chance having the same problems."
2,Yikes,Very bad directions for putting it together- confusion as to how it goes together. Screw holes don't match up when it is together. It's a poor product.
4,Cart,I love having this because I am now organized with all my paper work. I store in underneath my countertop between my kitchen and family rooms where I have a couple of bar stools next to it. When its time to pay bills I just slide it out and it makes it super easy to stay organized.
1,Missing Parts = Bad Product,"This cart was delivered to me without the wheels. I dont care how great the cart itself is, if it doesn't come with all the parts it gets one star."
2,Be Careful: Think Twice!,"This product came without the packet that was supposed to have screws and nuts, and also without the threaded inserts that a few of the screws were supposed to screw into having been welded in place on the file cabinet sides. I ended up purchasing a small set of hardware that I used to complete the assembly of the cabinet. The cabinet components appear to be of good strength and finish, so it remains true that ""you get what you pay for."" My choice was to buy the hardware or send the thing back or spend the better part of a morning wading through customer service. I chose the easy way out. The cart now serves my purpose just fine."
5,Lorell Mesh Roling File,It can be wherever I am and I can store ring binders or file supplies on the bottom. Ican do my filing in front of the TV or in my Office. Life is good.
2,DraZonk,"Not all that impressed - wasn't the easiest to put together and I had to hammer it out to make it fit. I almost feel like it was returned and slightly bent or something. Then, to top it off, the file folders hit the bottom which is really annoying. Not that happy with this purchase."
2,difficult to assemble,"When I began to assemble I found lots of defects. Between the two boxes I was able to assemble one defect free except of some warped pieces cart. Coating was chipped in a variety of places and edges bent. Even good pieces had very rough edges, so I have to be careful not to cut myself."
3,"Attractive cart, bad machining","Ah, you sexy beast! You make the office look like a million-dollar operation of efficiency and style! The only problem? You are machined so poorly that one of your screws will not insert, as the holes don't align well. Thankfully, I'm not riding you like a station wagon through the halls, or you'd fall apart like a teen at Justin Bieber show."
5,"Well-built, economical rolling file cart",Very happy with my purchase. This cart was relatively simple to put together and is quite sturdy.It holds a good amount of files and rolls well. This cart does exactly what was expected.I definitely recommend it.
2,Probably a counterfeit,"Compare to the original BP-5L battery I have, the build quality for this battery is obviouslylower in many aspects. I cannot say for sure it's a counterfeit, but there are manydifferences between this and the original battery:- The circles around ""+"" and ""-"" are thinner.- The font of ""NOKIA"" is thinner.- The paint of words and symbols are much less clear.- The seam between the plastics are not well-glued.- In English it reads ""MADE IN HUNGARY"", but in French is reads ""MADE IN CHINA"""
4,Great Buy,"I've always been a supporter of Philips products, they always have good products for great prices. This TV has a great picture and good sound. Plus, you can't get any better for this price range. Overall, a great buy!"
1,"Great picture,,sound is horrible","The pictue is really great, but after about 2 months the bass speaker [fails] and all you get is total vibration from the bass speaker. This is the 2nd one I've owned. The first one had a bad bass speaker right out of the box. I will never buy another Phillips product ever again !! I had big expectations for the Phillips TV, but they were quickly dissolved."
2,clear but it buzzes,"We got this TV for Christmas, but regretting it already.Well, in all fairness, the picture quality is quite good, comparable to a Sony. However it has this annoying buzzing sound from the back of the TV tube. Well if you turn the volume loud enough it drowns it away, but I have a baby in my room and often have to turn down the volume, thus the buzzing sound is louder then the audio. Think twice before purchasing!"
3,It looks really Stylish.,"My boyfriend and I love the stylish tv, so so stylish, that's the main reason we brought it. Although the picture were kind of blurry at times, and it shuts down by itself, at time too. Really odd. We watch waterworld on it every night."
3,I've owned this filter for 3 years now,"I've had this filter for 3 years of continuous operation. It worked pretty well for the first 2 years but the last year has been dissapointing. I broke one of the handles to switch to clean mode off. Even though the filters have been cleaned, it now doesn't seem to keep the pond clean at all. Like another person posted, the red indicator of a clogged filter has never worked. I however have never had a problem with leaks or O-ring/clamp problems. Gonna try a new brand for this next one."
4,"Good filter for money, I've tried many","Forget about moving the mechanism to flush mode, flush mode won't work well at all..Take off top, remove filters and flush hard with garden hose, reassemble, being carefull with Seal. Seal may not stay put easy. Has to stay put to close the unit.Be carefull with clamps, don't force. For the money, its a great filter. I'm happy with mine.I've had mine for 19 months.I removed most of the BIO balls and replaced with another course filter ring...For more filtering."
1,Cannot Clean It,"I recently bought a home with a backyard pond, which had an existing Sunterra Filter just like the one pictured. I removed the top to take the cleaning elements out for cleaning, and I couldn't replace the top. It's virtually impossible to press it far enough down on the casing body so that you can snap the retaining clips into place. So figuring it was old and needed replacing, I bought this one new from Amazon. When it was delivered yesterday I took it out of the box and for a trial run I removed the top and tried to replace it, while I was still in the kitchen and before hooking anything up. The new one was just as impossible to replace the top, even though I could turn it, press with my body weight all over the top, and do everything possible to try to get the top in place to fasten the retaining clips. I returned it today for a refund. Don't buy this product, or else you'll never be able to replace the cleaning sponges or bio-balls that are inside."
3,OK for the price,"OK, this isn't the best pond filter for sure but my experience with it has not been that bad. Yes, the backflush and the red pressure indicator are not very effective, but we've had our pond for six years now with the original Sunterra filter lasting 4 years with no problems. Eventually though, the clamps lost their grip and the filter would leak under pressure. You can tell when it's going south when the whole filter appears to rise out of the ground (which is just the lid expanding upwards due to extra play in the clamps) when you first turn on the pump. Got a second filter 2 years ago and it's still going fine. To clean it effectively you do have to take it apart and you should clean the internal filter elements with non-chlorinated water. We've got about an 800 gallon pond and just clean the filter twice a year. So for the money, it's not a bad deal, just watch it carefully and be aware of it's limitations."
3,Not for serious pond owners or larger ponds over 1000 gallons,"The product filters well. The problem comes in when you attempt to move the assembly from incoming water to backflush. Both filters I have had like this one have the same problem. The wings used to move the assembly break very easily and on this unit, the assembly won't move at all."
3,leeks on edge,"Looks will built, O-Ring seal for topHave a small Leak around the top seal, when it get warmer outside will try and get a better fit."
5,Excellent stunt kite!,This is my second stunt kite and I find tricks much easier to pull off in this kite.Very high quality and great looks! I just love the color scheme!
4,a wonderful cd,"I generally am not drawn to musiic that can be described as New Age. However, this cd is wonderful, beautiful and with enough variation from track to track to remain a compelling musical journey. Not only is the voice beautiful, but the instrumentation is mesmerizing and played masterfully."
5,Wow...,What an amazing example of genre breaking music. Everything from the singer's voice to the musician's attention to detail creates an atmosphere and mood I've rarely experienced before. I want to see Vas live! This is a group to pay attention to. I'm going to get the other albums. Big recommendation. I'm hooked.
2,"Some good tracks but for the most part, not very interesting","I would neither compare Vas to Dead Can Dance nor to Loreena Mc Kinnit. Their sound is definitely thier own. It is new age music with beautiful vocals and good percussion work. The melodies however remain weak and for the most part repetitious. This album is a great improvement on the first two but apart from three or four tracks, the rest sounds again like the first two albums with little variety. The album is much more produced and darker in sound but at times falls into banality. I have found that in order to enjoy Vas, I have to program a few select pieces on the CD player, otherwise the entire album becomes tedious and boring. I have friends who love it but their taste is mostly geared towards new age. People with a taste for world music might find this eventually ""not happening""."
2,Too much hype,The music on this recording is very repetitious as though they took the same formula on one piece and applied it to everything else. The melodies become boring after a while and there is no real instrumental break to give a breather to the repetitious style of vocals. It is well recorded and has some production value but there are truly only two songs that are listenable. It should appeal though to fans of new age music.
2,I Feel The Same Way...,"I thought I was the only one thinking the same way about this band's music! While the drummer is great, the singer is not anywhere in the same league as Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance but she does have a pretty voice. Everybody seems to like this band a lot but, frankly, the CDs quickly get very boring and repetitive. Gee, I wonder what their next album will sound like..."
3,Good but not Great,"Well as i am a huge Dead Can Dance fan I am always on the lookout for something along those lines. I had read several reviews of Azam Ali/Vas and went for it. While they are a talented group and Azam's voice is spectacular (a smoother (?) Lisa Gerrard?) they are not NEARLY as talented musically as DCD. You will see many reviews stating that the songs mostly sound the same but they sound good. Well that may be okay for some, but a bit of creativity is was makes good music to me.I have not listened to any other Vas or solo records so this is the only recording by them I am going by.Would I buy another? Yeah."
1,New age boredom for ever and ever,"Same old boring vocals, same old boring arrangements, same old boring compositions... From one album to another Vas sounds the same over and over again. Snnzzz...."
4,"Spiritual, beautiful, and a bit haunting","First of all, let's address the Dead Can Dance issue. While it's clear that Vas has been influened by some of the same music and culture that has influenced DCD, it is neither accurate nor fair to paint Vas as a DCD knockoff.Vas seems more firmly grounded in Far Eastern traditions, eschewing the cultural eclecticism of DCD for a more focused presentation. Where DCD had a number of tracks that delved into Middle Eastern dance, Vas stays decidedly mid-to-low tempo, offering music that is more suited to reflection or relaxation. Some of the album's slowest moments are almost haunting, but not in a sinister or unsettling way.The vocals are lush and beautiful, and the instrumentation is appropriately exotic. Should appeal to fans of Enya, Loreena McKennitt, Rhea's Obsession, DCD, etc. A solid album."
5,Breathtaking.,"Vas continues to amaze with the high quality of their music. The collaboration of Azam Ali and Greg Ellis remains one of the best examples of what can happen when rhythm and melody are balanced perfectly. Like their previous two CDs, there is a good mix of percussive and contemplative songs here. Top recommendation."
4,Good to the next-to-last drop,"As a director considering plays, I found this one to have some good characters, a solid throughline, and plenty of opprortunity to make your own decisions. It would be easy to paint any of the women (especially the mother) into being a stock character, but the web of relationships expose facets that can create a depth that takes it out of it's ""We gotta get out of this place"" premise.One might think, though, that the final scene was accidently typed into the script from incomplete notes that Blessing had accidently left in the stack when she sent it off. Luckily, it's easy to fix."
5,"If you like Cuban music, you will love this album!",No other cuban band in USA comes close to the quality and authenticity of Charanga Cubana.
2,Seems to run out of steam,"This was probably the first attempt to tell the history of the 1892 Homestead Steel Strike since the books that came out in the 1890s very shortly after the event. It's hard, in part because the basic message of the strike and its outcome was and still is pretty discouraging. I had the feeling Wolff was running out of enthusiasm for the task well before he or I got to the end of the book. I was also disappointed in the map of Homestead, which turned out sketchy and inaccurate when I laid it beside a street map of the town from that time. There were useful materials in the Homestead public library when I looked (after Wolff's book was published) that apparently he didn't look into. I'm guessing better books on the subject have been written since this one came out."
4,Hot August Nights in Venice,"This book seemed a little more leisurely than most, even though it takes place over a week or so. It's the hottest week of the year and all sensible Venetians have headed for the hills including Brunetti's family. He has to stay behind to solve a transvestite murder in the neighboring city of Mestre. As usual, Brunetti is intuitive and humane and clever enough to manipulate his idiot boss Patta. This book marks the first appearance of the remarkable Signorina Eletra, the Questura secretary who is skilled at computer research and has an amazing ability to ferret out the most secret information. I am a Donna Leon fan and have read all the books I can get my hands on (about 6, I think). This is one of my favorites. Leon evokes the stiffling August Venetian weather and its effect on the inhabitants as she takes us into the gay underworld. I believe Leon has written 13 Brunetti novels. I wish they'd publish them all here in the U.S. I always want more."
4,Title Tells it All.,"The Skye in JuneI had gotten to the point where I was fed-up with Donna Leon bashing tourist to Venice and swore to stop reading her novels. Alas, comes along Dressed for Death and after the first page, I was hooked. Must have been the red heels or was it the man in them? One way or another, I'm back in ""interest"" for the detective work of Cmmissario Guido Brunetti. This must have been one of Ms. Leon's first books because he's not so tired out as in later ones. The lesson here is, don't judge an author's prejudices for her fellow-kind, by all her books. (is she not a transplant to Vencie, herself?) Read this book, you'll be glad you did."
5,I love mine,"I ordered this exact system and I've had it about 3 weeks. No problems, easy setup, and man it screams. All the things I wanted to add to my old system are on this one. With Hyper-threading I can suft the web while I burn cds. No matter what system you buy, make certain it has hyper-threading!!!"
1,Does not stand on its own!,"I am a big fan of Paul's music. By this I mean his studio albums and also the score to ""Blue Crush"". This CD is very disappointing because the music does not stand on its own i.e. it can only coexist with the movie. For this reason I do not understand why it was even released, especially that the beautiful ""Blue Crush"" score, which is by far more ""independent"", was not officially released."
3,"Good,but the sequel's better","This is a good horror movie score.It fits the movie,and is worth a listen.But Marco Beltrami's ""Underworld:Evolution""score is much better."
2,Not so good score,"Was hopeing it would be a bit better, guess the movie sound effects made it what it was. not harm though still okay."
3,Alot better than the soundtrack!,"I also bought the soundtrack and was very dissapointed. I have always been a fan of musical scores though and looked forward, after seeing the movie, to hearing the score. I was truly enjoyed the mix of goth-techno and classical effects. I was also surprised to hear ""Red Tape"" by Agent Provocateur as well as a wonderful bonus track called ""Keep Watch Over The Night"". Some of the music is a little too soft and quiet to completely hold my attention, but over all, the CD was very good."
5,Perspective,"Great book, and a constant reminder of the simple fact that Freedom is not now, nor has it ever been free.It is won and vigilantly maintained by those who, through incredible struggle and sometimes seemingly insurmountable odds, persevere and simply never, ever, ever, give up.This book is about these brave souls, who, when faced withterror, looked it squarely in the eye and became the stuff of legends.I read one story per day, and it gives me all the perspective I need to ""earn"" my day and appreciate the fact that because of men and women like those portrayed here, I am an American and free.Doug Moore - Cardiff by the Sea, CA"
5,Unbelievable book.,"This is a must have book that tells about the individuals that have received the Medal of Honor. The book tells the story of all living award recipients and provides award winning photography to supplement the writing. The stories tell of friendship, courage, determination, honor, etc. Every American should have this book on their coffee table. You will not be disappointed."
2,Incomplete,Not worth the price. It was a disappointment. It does not cover all the Medal of Honor recipient. It is incomplete. How can you forget Audi Murphy the most decorated person of any war.
3,"Good, but not a lot of detail...","There are many interesting sayings in this book but some that I commonly hear are not in the book. Also, the descriptions are not the best. They typically give more historical information about the saying than definitions. Overall it's good, but not great."
5,Great Album,Good music for the Taylor Swift fan. This is where it all started for Taylor and this is a definite must have
5,"Not just a pretty face people, try listening to her !","First off, don't immediately writer her off just because she is pretty.That is discrimination too ! Her songs are nice love / heartbreak songs you expect a teen / young adult to sing. I especially love "" Teardrops on my guitar "", she really expresses the emotion of that song.Taylor is a very good singer, and will become an even better singer. She wrote a couple of the songs herself, and co-wrote the rest. If you've seen Her videos, you know she also plays the guitar.For those that don't usually listen to Country music, this is more of a Country-Pop album. Listen to the Amazon clips, its a great album !This edition is the deluxe, so you get a DVD of video clips. Nice high quality full screen stuff. Not those little ones from YouTube : ) You also get a few behind the scene videos / interviews. Great if you are a real fan."
5,Wow!,I love this cd I can't stop listening to it! Wow! It's so inspiring and has great beats! Taylor Rox!
5,AWESOME,"this was back when she did not auto-tune. This is a great cd. you can hear he feeling in her voice. So, just incase you did not read the title AWESOME.favorite song on here is I'm only me when I'm with you."
5,Taylor Swift,"THis is great music! I received it on time and in good condition. I went a little crazy ordering music, but I like the music on this CD."
3,Sweet,"I do like Taylors voice.I heard Our Song and loved it.Whats not to like when you want a song for you and yours.And as is pointed out they have a song as you listen to it how many of us stayed on the phone late at nite and sneaking out,ahh where have the years gone lol.Tim MaGraw so sweet.But this cd didnt grab me and want me to play it a couple of times as I do when I fall for a cd I really like,you know to stick in your head your fav songs I played it once and put it up."
4,so cute and she can sing,"I'm amazed this young lady wrote all her own songs, really good songs at that. this is a great cd for all country and pop lovers. her songs can really relate to real life situations and her vocals are excellent."
4,A WELL CRAFTED EFFORT....,"Definitely one of my favorite newer artists out there today.I'm sure we will be seeing many fine albums from her for years to come,if you go by this album. If you had to place it in a category,perhaps new country.The album had some fine ballads and soft tempo pop. Picture To Burn,Teardrops On My Guitar,The Outside,Stay Beautiful,Our Song and I'm Only Me When I'm With You highlight this well-crafted soft pop album.Young Taylor Swift has one of the better voices out there and am sure you will agree,if you pick this one up. Go get it and enjoy her fresh sound. A solid 4.5 for enjoyable soft pop...New Country if you will."
4,Taylor's first album,My daughter has been crazy about Taylor so we gave her some music to listen to. CD came in good shape and has been played until the cows come home.....
5,A brilliant debut...,"I first met Taylor at CMA Music Fest in June and I was instantly impressed by how sweet and down to earth she was. Soon after, I heard ""Tim McGraw"" on the radio for the first time and was hooked. I ran out right after work yesterday to pick up the album and only stopped listening to it long enough to sleep last night.The songs on the album are impressive on their own, but even more so when you consider that Taylor wrote or co-wrote every single one AND she's only 16. I think I read somewhere that she wrote one of them when she was 12.The music is honest and well produced, something that I think is rare these days in Nashville. Vocally, I think Taylor is superior to many of the top female artists out there. She is the real deal and I think she has a long and brilliant career to look forward to!"
3,I don't think I was the intended target audience,"I find Taylor has a lovely voice and I like the acoustic stuff on her album a lot. I just think being a 40 something male, I may not have been the intended audience. Every song is some kind of boy/girl story as if the songs were written from pages of her diary. This being her first album and having at least two singles, she should be proud. But I felt the album could have been stronger overall. Maybe whoever packaged her was searching with this album, maybe there was pressure on her to sound like every other Pop Country dribble coming from Nashville these days. If they want Taylor to succeed give her the acoustic guitar and let her sing, take note from the songs that became singles. This girl has talent don't bury it under a bunch of cliche Nashville assembly line canned production template."
4,Good listening,"Well-written songs performed in a style that's enjoyable to listen to. Not quite as good as Fearless, but well worth owning."
5,Taylor Fan,This is one of the best CDs I have purchased in a long time. Taylor is wonderful to listen to and fantastic in concert. If you have not seen her live I would definitely recommend it.
5,Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift's CD was very intertaining. I listen to it almost every morning. The quality is good and it has several songs that I like to listen to.
5,Great Music,"Great new talent. She is original and writes some very super songs. Obviously, I love her music or wouldn't have purchased her album; but I guarantee you will love this album. Definite buy it."
4,Reminds Me of High School,"I think Taylor's songs are rather high-school-esque, but at least she is in that age group so is being true to herself. I hate when singers have songs about things they could never really know anything about. I think she is a pretty talented song writer considering her age. She isn't the best vocally, but most of her songs are catchy, fun, or poignant. The only ones where her voice is just whiny and awful are ""Should've Said No"" and ""Picture to Burn."""
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this CD based on the raving reviews. It's just OK. You hear a couple of songs, you hear them all. Only one song that really stands out is the one she's known for ""Teardrops on my guitar"". The rest is pretty much the same. Same beat, same pitch, same style. Unbearable after awhile."
5,What a sweet Country Star!!!,"Great range, great lyrics, and unspoiled by trashy stardom developers usually only content to turn innocent girls into something thier dad's end up wondering,""what happened?"" You go Taylor....and keep the beauty and innocence as long as you can!!! The album has been listened to at least 30 times in a 3 week period. Thanks lil girl!!! Keep Kickin!Randy"
5,Taylor Swift CD,Great album and great service. I bought one for my son who has his own radio station from his home and one for myself. We enjoy them very much.
4,great album,"My daughter first introduced me to the sound of Taylor Swift, I must say that I am totally hooked and cant wait until her next album is released. Cant believe more people dont know about this talented singer and song writer. Great music to have in the car."
4,refreshing young talent,"I was late to jump on the wagon, but I have recently become a Taylor Swift fan. I liked ""Tim McGraw"" and ""Teardrops on My Guitar"" when I heard them on the radio. ""Picture to Burn"" is what finally tipped me to buy the full CD. I also enjoy ""Cold as You"", ""The Outside"" and ""Should've Said No"". She seems very mature for her years and it is refreshing that she does write her own material. Let's hope taylor Swift can stay real."
3,Dreadfully boring.,"I bought this CD because of the song Tim McGraw. There really isn't anything special about it, or unique about any of the songs. It could just be one monotonous track. I don't recommend buying."
3,Not what I expected,"I was excited to buy the CD for a great price that was a lot cheaper than what they usually sell for. The condition also said ""very-good."" The shipping was first class and cheap so that was a plus. However, when I got the CD it wasn't as good as described. The case wasn't in the best shape and the CD had problems playing track number 8 or it didn't play at all. Luckily, the seller was polite and let me return it for a full refund. I just thought it was a little unfair that I needed to pay for the shipping to send it back. Overall, I don't know if I will do business with this seller again, but CDwarehouse was polite, understanding, and responded to emails quickly. Thank you for your business nonetheless!"
1,OMG My Ears! Help!,"Taylor Swift is one of the worst singers I have ever heard. Whenever I see her perform on awards shows I am embarrassed for her (and cringing). I just don't understand how she ever got a record deal. And I don't understand her popularity. IMO, the girl just cannot carry a tune in a bucket."
1,Another re-release?,What is with these record companies? Why do they release an album in the first place if they are going to release it again 6 months or a year later with extra tracks? save them for the next album! Do the expect people to buy it again? Then they wonder why people download music for free.
1,"It's not that I don't like her, but another re-release","I like the album. It's really catchy, but come on why by the same album just becasue of a few new tracks...I could see if it was a single, but the same album..It is not like the record companies are going broke...her album went triple platnium and she broke a few records."
1,"Take some singing lessons, honey!","I had the unfortunate experience of listening to this album a few months back. Don't believe the hype, Taylor Swift is the worst country/pop musician I have ever heard! If this is country then what isn't? She can't sing to save her life, the lyrics are high school poetry, and her guitar playing is laughable. She is even worse live!!! yikes. I can't believe she sells like a zillion albums, her fan base must be tone deaf little tweens. She's a dime-a-dozen, can't wait 'til her career goes up in flames."
3,5 for the CD ; 1 for taylor Live,"The CD itself is easy to listen too. Nicely manufactured studio voice. But live? She is terrible live, sounds like a cat on a fence. Its amazing what they can to a voice on the studio.."
3,Good first effort,"I bought Taylor's CD after seeing her on the CMA awards awhile back. I like her music, although it is somewhat juvenile...but I can totally understand that considering her age. I enjoy Taylor ok, but I think I will stick with Miranda Lambert."
4,interesting ?,"Heres what Im thinking ( But first of all ) This cd is so amazing. Everytime a artist comes out I compare there album to my all time favorite debut cd Trisha Yeearwood's debut. 5 stars no doubt about it ! This is another great debut and Im thinking by a 15 yo. Faith Hill didnt even strike me like Taylor Does. I would have to say my persoanl faves on the album would have to be "" Tied Together With A Smile "" and "" Cold As You "" both song take the tug at your heart ( and it gets it ) Of course I love "" Tim McGraw "" and the beautiful "" Teardrops on My Guitar "" Even though I hate the name DREW. Theres a reason why :-) But anyway this is a really great cd. Very interesting to let this 15ypo take you on a little journey. Taylor rock on gurl !"
2,Eh... something to listen too... I guess...,"There are few if any ""sterling"" cuts on this album. Mostly a collection of regional Funk/Soul acts that never made it to the big time. In the end you find out why too as none of these tunes make you wanna shout and shing a ling. As you'd expect, production values range from the passable to the criminal and everything in between. Not the worst album I've ever bought but most compilations usually contain ONE nugget worth its purchase price. Truth be told, this one did not. Only buy it if you've nothing else to spend your money on.Worf"
4,"Excellent product, less-than-perfect paint job","This watering can says quality from the construction to the nice little brass ""Haws"" label on top, but what about that paint flaw right next to the label? I didn't return it because it was ""just a watering can"", but at this price, I expected a little more observation from the Haws quality control department. Other than that, it really is a nice product that should last for many years. Sure beats the cheap plastic stuff we usually see in stores."
5,Rufus loves these.,My dog really likes these better than the regular strips. This is the second order and we are very pleased.
3,Wha wrong Beenie?,"Nuff love to Beenie.The album Art & Life could have been much much better if it did not have in all that hip hop.I know Beenie Man wants to be an entertainer but stick with the dancehall vibe.Beenie Baby is ur biggest fan and trust me this is not a so good album the best was album was Many Moods of Moses.I love nuff songs like Haters & Fools,Crazy Notion,Anaylze This,Orginal tune,and Art & Life.The rest can pass but Beenie Is going to drop if he don't get his act together.Beenie Man you my number one artist no matter what though."
3,"Solid, but far from a classic","I bought this album about 2 years ago during the Christmas season at a local CD store in Wilkes-Barre. Every time I hear the title track, I always think its some kind of Christmas jingle. It is the best song on the album, but ""Some Tonight"" with Tanto Metro and Devonte is also good. So basically I go to track 9 then 15, hit the CD eject button, and throw it to the side."
1,He advocates the killing of gays,"In his music, Beenie Man advocates killing gays. More than30 gays have been killed in Jamaica where he comes from.His music has lots of influence there. In some cases mobssang his anti-gay songs while they killed a man who might have been gay.When asked to apologize and change his ways he wrote a song about how hewould not apologize. If someone advocated the killingof Blacks or Jews, they would not be tolerated. It seems strangethat in the 21st century the world still tolerates someonewho advocates the killing of gays. Please don't support him bypurchasing his music."
2,reggae fan,Typical commercial reggae. If you started liking Beenie man for WHO AM I you will be disappointed here.
5,"NOT JUST AN ARTISTE, HE'S AN ENTERTAINER",BEENIE HAS ONCE AGAIN PROVEN THAT HE'S THE MOST VERSATILE ARTISTE IN THE DANCEHALL BIZ TODAY. THERE IS SOMETHING ON THIS ALBUM FOR EVERYONE. I THINK THIS WILL INCREASE HIS FAME AS HE CROSSES OVER INTO THE MAINSTREAM. NUFF RESPECT TO BEENIE MAN. KEEP ON ENTERTAINING.
2,Late and small,"This was originally due on September 1 and didn't ship until Oct 13, and when it finally did it was digest size as well instead of the usual larger prestige format that special comics like this get. Its a great length for a prestige, but as the digest size it just seems very very small.The presentation is nice however, even with the non-glossy paper. The story ties in well with the film as well as the established history of the characters in Dark Horse's prior titles, and still takes a unique stance on the entire thing as well.Its just too little too late, and too small. Huge letdown."
1,Worse AVP Aliens title ever,"By far the worse title, doesnt compare to the others at all. Poorly written, poor story, waste of money, sorry."
3,A solid read but lacks depth,"Like the accompanying movie, Alien vs. Predator: Thrill of the Hunt looks nice but ultimately fails to grip the reader. That's not to say that the comic is without merit, but the cons outweigh the pros. The story is well composed, and the action is faced paced and fun, but eventually the whole thing runs out of steam and starts repeating itself. Roger Robinson tries hard to encapsulate the reader by reassuring them that the end will be spectacular, but it dosn't quite match the high expectations I had for this, in what was supposed to be more energetic. A good read, but perhaps it could have done with a stronger story before being rushed into production. A must for hardcore AVP fans only."
2,Not what I expected,"Aliens vs. Predator: Thrill of the Hunt was NOT what it seems. The dialogue was terrible, the art just O.K., it's in digest size, it's not the fine quality storytelling the comics used to be,(see Aliens vs. Predator Omnibus volume 1) and it didn't have much action. It starts off good, put starts to lag and becomes a mess. The characters are two-dimensional,and the reader feels like they should be killed(I'm on that side). For a while there's no action, and when the action start it feels rushed, and leaves the reader with a sense of being cheated out of a good AVP graphic novel. C-"
2,Graphic SF Reader,"Digest sized production. A garden variety type story. It seems it is supposed to be 100 years or so post Ripley, there are very few human colonies left. A corporate expedition takes a ship to try and rebuild one. They find a Predator, lock him up, as he is unconscious. They fail to treat him with respect. He lures them to a bunch of Aliens, hoping the humans will get rid of them for him. Many people die."
1,Expedited Flowers not undelivered on time,"Expedited Flowers were not undelivered on time to my friend who's birthday was on Sun, February 3, 2008. The expedited date is 2 to 4 days later. I am very unsatisfied.Floyd Atkinson"
1,Horrible,"Just horrible. Flowers arrived late and were dead, even thugh I'd paid $90 to have delivery expedited they didn't arrive for five days. And then they were dead.And then I found it impossible to complain -- couldn't find a phome number and amazon never responded to my emails.Worst experience I've evr had with an amazo affliate."
3,BAIT AND SWITCH / cut and run....,"The photo showed a nice Vase. It was not included. Delivery to the patient in her room was delayed nearly a week...despite an extra payment and charge... the flowers were dropped off at the Hospital front desk and were NOT delivered to the patient's room...not even to the Nurses station... Very tacky service.. The actual flowers were described by the recipient as nice but obviously they had to be several days less fresh after being delivered to the Hospital but NOT delivered to the patient....PLEASE DON'T WHINE THAT IT WAS THE HOSPITAL'S FAULT..This is not the way we do things in Florida. Arrangements to get the flowers to the patient's room or nurses station would have been reasonable. If there is no intention to deliver to the patient's hospital room, you should say so... and you should not charge for it..."
5,Great History,The best history of the 29th in WW1 you will find. If you have the chance to purchase one I highly recommend it. A must if you are WW1 historian.
4,TECNO EURO POP SOMETHING LIKE THAT !,"I LIKE THIS CD GOOD FOR A WORKOUT IT'S SOMETHING LIKE TCNO EURO POP SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S FROM SPAIN I HADN'T BEEN ABLE TO BUY IT AT THE LOCAL RECORD SHOP AS IT IS KIND OF RARE IT'S F ROM 1995 OR SOMEWHERE ALONG THAT TIME I PUT IT AND TURN MY DISCO LIGHT ON VERY SOOTHING YOU MAY ALSO LIKE REBECCA WITH ""DURO DE PELAR "" SHE'S FROM SPAIN AS WELL IF YOU'RE A DJ GET THIS CD FOR YOUR COLLECTION I'M SURE THE PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT AS FOR HER OTHER CDS I THINK THIS IS THE ONE I RECOMMEND"
5,buenisimo,"This cd is so great, i only wish minerva would get more coverage on spanish radio. the mixes are great, and if you like fey, let me tell you -this is much better."
4,Satisfied Customer,I am very satisfied with my Panasonic 32 inch television. It has a large screen and a beautiful cabinet. The picture quality is great. I'm not having a problem with the color being too dark. I am enjoying my television.
3,Help...Screen Adjustment,"I bought this TV and I think it's fine except for this one problem....All 4 sides are cut off. So if I am watching a baseball game I can't see 1/2 of the score that is across the top of the screen. Does anyone else have this problem? Please email me.... jaybald@yahoo.com if you have a solution.I know there is a ""Display"" mode (Normal/Wide view) but that isn't the problem....(another problem is they are backwards... Normal view has the black bars on the top/bottom of screen and Wide view is really like what ""normal"" mode is supposed to be)"
2,Panasonic CT-32E13,"This TV right out of the box, did not impress me. The whites are too white and the balcks are too black. It is very difficult to adjust the TV for a happy medium. Flesh tones are also very hard to dial in. I am going to return it."
1,"Horrible picture, do NOT BUY","My family bought this tv about a month ago. we hated it right from the get go, but gave it about 20 days to re-adjust. Nothing. The picture colors are oughful. The darker colors( almost all) blend in; a person standing next to a wall is blended in. Its like its one things. I have tried to re-adjust all the setting, nothing. I returned the Tv to bestbuy, where I baught it. Istead of this I purchased a 32"" FLAT SCREEN JVC, which had even more features, and the price difference probably was about 50-80 bucs. The new Tv is 100x better. No blending or anything like that. JVC makes quality TV's. This now is my 2nd JVC Tv, my old one lasted almost 7 years. I could have repaired my old one but, wanted a change to ""new"" better technology, which I did not get from The Panasonic TV. I will answer any of your questions at COuntamd@yahoo.com. Did anyone else happen to come across this problem? I've seen the same quality picture on these TV's in stores"
2,COULD have been great,"Sadly, this rendering of Urban Legends was a huge disappointment. The stories (all very short, which is one of my complaints) are poorly conveyed -- they reminded me of the average one-page homework essay papers that my lesser sophomore college students used to turn in. I had high hopes for this one but the authors blew it. If you're a solo musical entertainer and you need some short quips to stick in between songs, this one might work for you. Beyond that, don't waste money on this book."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this unit in December at WalMart. Of course, the price ($ 369) was attractive. However, by now I can only record from the AV inputs after burning a little piece from the TV input, so that the 630 will get in gear, and then changing inputs to the AV and burning what I really want. Otherwise the unit will commence to burn and shut down after about 1 minute.If I try to burn with NoName discs (that are working just fine on my Pioneer 106) it will not go at all. = Useless"
2,Kinda disapointed,"Upon seeing the advertisment for this player that promised ""Eternal Happiness awaits"" I rushed out and bought it Because I could use me some of that. So, not only did I not get eternal happiness, but this thing couldn't even make yogurt (which if we all remember what the Dalai Lama said Yogurt=Eternal Happiness). So, I guess the recorder worked fine, but since I didn't have any yogurt what the heck was I supposed record myself eating? Well at least good ol' reliable cottage cheese will be there for me."
4,Pleased with this machine.,"I bought this machine on ebay new for 300.00. I've only had it for a few days. It works as advertised, and I've made 20 dvds, with out one coaster using Maxell DVD+R. I've played around with Maxell +RW's too and they seem to work also. I have used these DVD+R in a couple of different players with complete compatability. I do not know about the durability of this machine, maybe I'll post in a few months. But so far, it works very well, with no compatability issues using other players in my house. I'd recommend it."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER PLAYERS!,"I recently purchased this model from a local retailer, and while the unit works in its own universe, it is far from desirable as far as the BIG picture goes.This machine will record +RW discs, but they will NOT play in most +RW capable settop players! Why doesn't the product description EVER address this issue?! Just because it records on a +RW (or whatever) type of disc, does NOT mean that other players will play it!...And what did Magnavox have to say about it?? After a lengthy conversation with tech support and additional call-back from their DVD Recorder specialist, all I got was ""I'm sorry, we cannot help you any further with this issue.""AVOID THIS MACHINE!"
4,A defective front S-video input. Everything else is great.,"I bought this DVD burner from a local Target. The machine is made in Hungary. After a month of trials, I've found the S-video input in the front (CAM 1) does not work and an expert has confirmed it. Fortunately, it has an S-video input in the back using EXT 2. This one works, so I've decided not to return this item to the store, a complicated process. Compared with Korea, Taiwan and China that have more than 20 years of experience in making the consumer electronics, Hungary is relatively new in the field and defects in the product are therefore understandably more common. DVD+R and DVD+RW from this machine can be played in my Sony DVD player, though the Sony's manual says it plays only DVD-R and DVD-RW. My Apex player can also play it. However, it cannot be played in my 1.5-year-old Sony notebook. The image quality of this DVD burner makes all VHS VCRs obsolete."
4,all good,"I bought this recorder over the weekend, and have had absolutely no problems with it at all. I've been able to record from TV, VCR, and camcorder quite easily. It does exactly what I want it to do, and it was a steal at $350."
3,Compatibility,"Just bought this unit so haven't used it enough to give a full evaluation, but I can say that it produces RW disks that are compatible with my cheap little $49 Apex dvd player"
4,revenge is a dish best served cold and bloody,"this film inspiried the classic ""kill bill vol. 1 & 2"" and it stars the legendary and beautiful taiwanese cutiepie judy lee aka chai ling. also starring the great wong tao anf the great wong wing san who also choreographed the action is a reknowned choreographer like the lau bros. this movie had a great story line, great action by the legends and great acrobatics by lee hai shing who was helping judy lee in her mission. bad picture quality and fullscreen is it keeps it from being a 5 but overall a very good film arguably lets say in your top 50."
2,Cheap product,"I purchase this product to replace an an older, now broken radio/CD player. I found it to be fairly flimsy, and it does not have digital tuning, which was not made clear in the product description."
2,Not so great,"It's good for the size and AM/FM radio use only.After 1 week the CD player started acting up. No it only plays certain CD's but when it does, the suons is VERY distorted. This is the second CD player I have purchased for my office that has done the same thing (two different brands). It's hard to find a good, small CD player."
3,Not like 1080i quality.,Looks like 720p quality and put those in a disc. Kind of weird for watching four movies in a disc.
2,"comprehensive, yet accurate????","There is a ""serious"" mistake in chapter related to the dispute settlements; the Jay Treaty was signed in 1974? Mr. Shaw?? don't think so. can I rely on any other historical dates in this book? not really."
3,it was ok...,"..but basically this whole CD revolves around the Pidgeon John track. Otherwise, I found this CD to be very similar to the weak hip-hop offered buy most Gotee artists. Maybe some Labklik, Gospel Gangstaz and Pettidee would have helped make this CD better."
4,Well done,"The author does a nice job of sorting thru the eveidence to reach what he thinks are the correct conclusions of Patrick's life, based on a very limited amount of evidence. he is judicious and fair. easy to read."
2,"Ok, but might irritate Catholics","This reads from a more protestant angle, and never refers to St. Patrick as a Catholic. His references to Patrick's ""Cult"" may tend to irritate some Catholics. I was definitely surprised, expecting more from this book as he writes about one of the Catholic Church's most celebrated Saint. The writings of St. Patrick are in the 2nd half of the book and are the only part that is worth reading in my opinion. I will look for a book without the uwanted opinions."
4,Clock DVA - Sound Mirror,"Dark, electronic moods permeate Clock DVA's SOUND MIRROR. And while the musical elements of the tracks here are repetitive, that's part of their power: the loops makes for a cumulative energy to the tracks. Indeed, the second version of ""Sound Mirror,"" without the vocals, seems to better one, as the elements have a opportunity to build amongst themselves. ""The Sonology of Sex"" is much more driving and eerie, with its sampled narration of Countess Elisabeth Bathory. But the long and moody, ""Hacker"" takes the prize here. With its slow thump and quiet development, it has a creepiness that builds until you're completely lost in the machine."
1,hope thi review gets posted,"I already submitted my review, but it was not posted,..I'm guessing due to the fact that it was not a good review?Anyway, These cookies were TERRIBLE. and NOT ""gourmet"".They were stale, stiff, unflavorfull and the top layer was crunchy (it wasn't supposed to be)We were able to eat about 4 of these awefull things and tossed the rest in the trash. Which means they are pretty bad since the guys will eat just about anything.... Save your money! buy something else!The only reason I chose 1 star,..is becuase I'm unable to choose less than one star."
1,Piece of junk,This item is a piece of junk. Can`t believe Amazon has it on its site. The top for the light won`t fit into top.Probably once the light get wet its history so its a waste. It floats ok but have to put a hole at top of container so it will completely fill with water.Make me mad but its more a pain in the ass to return it. Don`t buy it!
3,Lighthouse Chemical Feeder,"Cool item, but you have to punch holes in the chemical compartment based on the volume of your pool. Also, the thing would not stay upright, and kept tipping to one side, even when I added a weight to the compartment. Too bad too, because it looks really neat when you can get it stay upright."
5,"A lot of ""read"" for the penny!","This is a fine introduction to popular Russian fairy tales, including the story of the little snow girl (a childless couple builds a daughter out of snow) and ""Frost"" (cruel stepmother sends girl out to freeze in the snow, but Frost sees her kindness and spares her-- the nasty stepsisters are not so lucky). The similarity between some of the Russian tales and our own English fairy tales is interesting (why is the stepmother always the evil one?). This introductory collection leaves one wanting to learn more Russian tales."
3,"Doesn't match up to ""Two Teardrops""","To say I was disappointed when I first heard this album only means that his previous effort, ""Two Teardrops"" was so good, it is unmatched. My favorite songs here are ""Turn In the Road"", ""Make It Look Easy"" and ""Been There"" (with Clint Black). Steve tries some new things on this album, like ""I Just Do"", a song that fits George Strait's style. Then there's ""Bloodlines"", the instrumental duet with his son. Steve excels at instrumental music, and if you enjoy this track, you owe it to yourself to listen to ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", if you haven't had the chance. Marcus Hummon once again offers his genius on ""I Wish I Were a Train"". Unfortunately, I have to hit the skip button a couple of times. I personally didn't like ""Longer Letter.."" and ""Wouldn't Be Love"". But with 13 songs altogether, Steve gives the country music listener their money's worth. If you're a fan, any Steve Wariner album is a welcome addition to your collection."
4,Impeccable Musicianship,"Steve Wariner's 2000 release ""Faith in You"" follows his two critically acclaimed and hit laden albums ""Two Teardrops"" and ""Burnin' the Roadhouse Down"". While ""Faith in You"" doesn't contain any big radio hits, its full of good,laid-back country songs filled with impeccable musicianship. Steve's own virtuosity on the guitar is complemented by Matt Rolling's keyboard artistry,Paul Franklin's steel,and Biff Watson's and Steve's son Ryan's guitar licks.My favorites are Faith in You, I Just Do,Turn in the Road, Waiting in the Wings and I Wish I were a Train. A couple of up-tempo numbers, Katie Wants a Fast One and Been There give balance to the album. All in all a solid effort and one that I would recommend to country music lovers."
3,"Not Steve's best, by far.","Love the instrumental piece with his son. Wish he would do MORE of that. Not that I don't like his voice, just needs some better material. He rules when he does jam'n country with strong guitar licks. That is not present on many of his albums?"
3,Steve Where Are You?,"I have loved and followed the music of Steve Wariner for the last 13 years. His voice is so smooth you can't help but like it. I miss the brilliant writing absent from his last 3 albums. His earlier albums were all works of art but the paint has begun to fade on his latest albums including this one. Still love Steve's voice but this album does not move me like ""The Weekend"". I miss you Steve..........Come back soon!"
5,Great Problem Set,This book is a nice collection of many classic and nonclassicproblems in combinatorics and graph theory. You should have a basic knowledge of combinatorics and you'll like the book very much.
4,Skills we already know but may take for granted...,"This book really stresses mainly on the psychology of people and how we interact and respond to each other. This will give you the knowledge how to improve in business relationships, improve yourself as a whole person or to manage people in general.Some of the theory described is how we should remember others' names, talk in terms of their interests, let the other person think the idea is his, and most importantly always allow the other person to save face. Promoting understanding other peoples behavior and this may have very positive effect of reducing day-to-day conflict.Some of the book may come off as Phony, but I think it is how you read it. You are not being phony if you apply this in your life if you truly do care about other people. I have heard a lot about this book and read all the reviews. This is certainly a book that you cannot take what other people have to say, you need to read it and then judge for yourself."
5,This book is great.,"There are plenty of reviews about this great book.I recommend you buy it and read it, it is very helpful."
5,Concrete practices for influencing people,"If you really want to learn the methodology for interacting with people, you should definetely read this book;it is the best first step along this path. I was fascinated when I first read it(half of the book was underlined:)Eventhough some people think that the techniques were outdated, I think that the concept in the book is timeless. Carnegie's sincerity and emotional intelligence are worth rereading."
1,Not really compatible with Kindle,"Unfortunately when this was converted to Kindle they set the margins improperly, so the right 1/3 of the kindle is ""blank"". What this means in laymans terms is that it reads poorly, you have less words on each line and it's quite frustrating."
2,Wont Help - Dont Even Waste Time,"This book makes no sense in our time. Let me give you an example, he says everytime you are trying to make a choice, pull out a one-dollar bill, look at lincoln and ask yourself ""What would lincoln do?"" WTF?I do not recommend this book at all, he goes on talking for hours without giving you the ""purpose"" of the stories he gives. Sure, I can talk for hours and tell stories that make no sense at all.Dont Waste your time, you would improve much much much better if you start talking to yourself instead of listening to this guy."
4,Helpful,"Exactly what I was expecting. It is written/based on a period in which we do not live in, but you have to have an open mind when listening. Concepts still apply today. Very informative =)"
5,Could be the best book about sales ever written,"Reads like a best selling novel. Sound advise with real life examples.Even though the book was wriiten a long time ago , its like the honeymooners,timeless.The advise Dale Carnegie gives will always be relevant."
1,Too Expensive,"You would think a book this old would cost less. Especially considering it is a Kindle book. The paperback version is cheaper, and yet the Kindle version costs more despite not having to print it. Given the suit this publisher has settled, stick with the paperback version. Great book, but way overpriced."
5,Must have for any collection!,"You'll find it on several top 100 lists, it's is worth reading. Take notes, reference them on a regular basis."
3,"A book of concepts you may know, but just don't use.","How to Win Friends and Influence People is a more nicer version of ""48 Laws of Power"". It is full of helpful insights about how to get along with others and make friends (avoiding arguments, smiling, making others feel important, learning what interest others, actively listening, not criticizing others, allowing others to believe they are correct when they aren't, etc). It basically covers all of the basic skills that you learned as a child, and that your parents taught you, but over the years have chosen not to follow for whatever reason. This book is pure common sense knowledge, and yes by following these rules you may win friends, but you may also loose something as well....""Yourself"", by trying too hard to please others.In conclusion, this is a good self help book for dealing with colleagues, and new aqcuaintances."
5,How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie,This book is a great help in assisting my husband and I with our new business.
5,A must read for all people that come in contact with anyone!,"If you are in sales or any job or profession where you are in contact with people, PLEASE read this book(better yet, this manual) it absolutely woke me up when I read it. As you read it your attitude completely changes. Once you begin to read, you don't want to stop....so read on!!!"
5,Easy read that will help you at work.,The author used great examples to help illustrate lessons. Strongly recommend this to everyone who works in an office or with people in general.
1,Original Copy?,"Update: So far I have tried 3 different versions on the Kindle. They ALL appear to have been edited by a first grader, including the one E Williams is pushing. Is there a GOOD copy for the Kindle? [...]! The original material is great, good stuff everyone should know. If only the publishers would read it!One problem with Kindle and ebooks is that so many unqualified people can create them. This Kindle edition is full of typos. This book is in the public domain so it has been worked over many times. We need to know the source that was used to copy the work. It is obviously different from other versions. Is this a copy of the original? Or updated version? And how much was added or changed by the copier?It's like trying to follow a map that someone has edited."
4,Great classic about how we could improve our capacity to deal with people,"Also if is written many years ago, is still actual and the advise surely will help me in my job and in my social and family life"
5,A must have book,"This book could be perfeclty called ""Manual to life"". It is really amazing the things you'll learn from this book."
1,Awful Lack of Punctuation in Kindle version!,"This review pertains to the following Kindle book: How to Win Friends and Influence People (With easy click Table of Contents) - ASIN: B001E37F96. (Thank you to commenter for clearing that up).I was excited to read this book to learn insight on how to communicate with others but was disappointed by how challenging it was to follow as it was missing commas, periods, colons, and other punctuation throughout! This is ridiculous! That definitely shows me how important punctuation is in writing!! It's hard to read a work fluidly when you have to stop and go back to put together fragments and break up run-ons in someone's train of thought."
3,Not bad,"This book starts well but then it seems to become dull. It does have some good basic principles of relating well to others, but some of the book seems to give advice that sounds manipulative rather than honest. It is a decent read nonetheless. If you like this one, I also recommend ""The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People"" by Stephen Covey. So I would think that most people would like Mr. Carnegie's book (being that it's very well known). Hopefully it will indeed help you in winning friends and influencing people!"
2,Good book but kindle version is overpriced,I've bought this book three times and thought I would add it to my kindle. But the kindle price is $5 more than the last softcover version of this I bought. Get James Allen's How a man thinketh for $1 instead.
4,Good condition unread unmarked paperback,"The paperback book is in quite good condition. It's unread, no notes, marks or dog-ears. One star off for having a couple of soda-can-bottom stains on the cover. Happily they came off nicely with a couple of wipes of a damp cloth. Now it looks almost brand new."
3,Need complete book,The audio book was great but when I received the disc pack I was missing disc 8 from the set which would of been great to finish it properly.cheers
4,Clost to Friends,This book is very useful for those who want to retain a good relationship with their friends.It's give a platform to make a better relationship.
3,Nonfiction prompt #4,There are seven habits told in this book. The first habit is be proactive. The second habit is begin with
2,Thoroughly unimpressed,"I have heard about this relatively famous book for many years and finally decided to read it. I'm sorry I did.I was thoroughly unimpressed. There was nothing in here I didn't already know just from basic social skills learned through life. I'll save you the time and trouble of reading this book...Smile, listen, compliment others, and don't be mean to people. Basically, treat other people the way you want to be treated.There are no deep psychological theories, no mysterious tricks, and no secrets revealed in this book that make it worth reading."
2,"""How to be a perfect phony"" would have been a more honest title","... and I thought Facebook was the main example of misuse of the word ""friend"".Great book to teach you how to feign empathy and pretend to care about people in order to be successful in your career while subtly worsening yourself as a human being. At least it can make you laugh now and then, as some advice is so blatantly phony. This is a book about manipulating people while doing your best to make them feel they are not being manipulated. (So, the words ""influence people"" in the title are quite apt.) It confuses appearances with substance, and it constantly misuses the term ""genuine"". ""Be genuinely interested in people's problems"" is meaningless advice. ""Genuine"" cannot be taught. You either are genuine or are not. The only thing you can teach is to *pretend* to be ""genuinely"" interested in people.The one point I'd give this book is that if you utterly lack any kind of basic social skills, it will at least teach you one or two."
3,How to win friends and influence people,"Excellent book great advice, a real wake call for me, now instead of fighting and being angry at my partner or children , I find ways to enpower the situation.Lorrie Bracaloni- happynaturalhorse.com"
4,The message still rings true.,"I found this book somewhat hard going at times, mostly due to the fact that the way books are written certainly has changed a little from when HTWF was first published in 1936! That aside, even though this wasn't a quick page turner for me I always found myself compelled to go back and devour just one more chapter. The information in the book is simple (so simple most people don't do it!) and it is just as relevant and insightful today as it would have been back in the 30's.Kirsty Dunphey, author -Retired at 27, If I can do it anyone can"
5,Success is Timeless,"Originally published in 1937 in an edition of only 5,000 copies, How to Win Friends and Influence People is without a doubt our favorite book of all time. In fact, it is annual required reading for our staff, and we wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.This is not a book that you struggle through once and put away, because it's lessons are timeless. Each time you read it you will pick up on something new that you can apply to your everyday life immediately.Learn fundamental techniques for handling people, ways to make people like you, winning people over to your way of thinking, and how to be a leader. This book has remained a best-seller for over 60 years, sold more than 45 million copies, and been translated into almost every known written language. Written in friendly down-to-earth language, it reads more like a story than the ""How To Be Successful"" encyclopedia it is."
4,Great book and good service,"This is a great book!! The service was quick and the item came in as advertised.Thanks,Guru(Boston, MA)"
2,"Nice read, but poor quality in Kindle version","This book was subtly recommended to me by somebody in a management position. I bought the kindle version 4 or 5 days ago, and I am just under halfway through for my first time. As Dale, and other reviewers, suggested I plan to read it a few times.Along with disabling the Text-to-Speech feature, it seems like they locked down the ability to change the look of the text. I own a Kindle Fire HD, and usually put my font-size at 3 or 4. To get the font to enlarge to a size I can easily read, I had to double my usual size, the font-size setting is currently at 7. The font-type option also doesn't change. So if you need larger font-size or a particular font to read, you will have difficulties."
4,How to Win Friends & Influence People,"A lot of common sense stuff, but a very good review none the less. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that spends a great deal of time working with other people in their day to day lives."
5,The title is outdated but you need to read this book,"I have not read this book in twenty years, however, it made such an impact on me years ago that I still recommend it to people to this day. In fact, I recently purchased two copies to give away. One to my son who is about to finish his tour of duty with the Marines and a spare copy to have on hand to give someone else should the opportunity arise. This is the best handbook for interpersonal relationships I have ever read."
5,Wonderful!,"I first read this book as a pre-high school student at my saddest, lowest point in life. I wanted to know the secret to getting people to like me. My mom bought me the hardcover copy of this book ... I still remember reading it in the bathtub. Carnegie's words are simple and soothing. The recipe for making friends isn't some coplicated formula, but a down-to-earth tactful approach. Naturally when I became an independent business owner, this book was on the booklist in the business. This book can be read by people of all ages and applied to all areas of life; school, business, on the job, in relationships, you name it! I also recommend ""Grow Rich While You Sleep"" By Ben Sweetland."
1,terrible edit job,"the book is worth reading but dont buy this kindle version. the formatting is horrible. Some sentances make absolutely no sense. Words are spelled correctly, they are just the wrong words."
2,Too many anecdotes,"I purchased this book after reading several online praises for it. Unfortunately once I started reading through ""How to Win Friends"" I noticed a similar trend to each chapter: tell a bunch of random stories relating to the point, then summarize with a quaint principle or rule, such as ""Be a good listener"" or ""Smile"". While I do think Carnegie's principles are useful, too much of the text is spent reiterating the point through what I found to be very boring historical examples. This book could easily be condensed from 250 pages down to 25 while still maintaining its effectiveness."
2,Content is great - the print is horrible,"Content is great - the print is horrible!Small print, dark pages that woul not completely open. Did not read this edition - waste of $$$."
2,"I took the course, it doesn't work","As with the Dale Carnegie Course itself, lots of BS in my opinion.Heavens forbid we dare to criticize anyone or give an opinion that may be in opposition to another. Being human means there is black, white and many shades in between. We can agree to disagree, can't we?I took the stupid course and felt like a cheerleader, having to give applause after each speech. Could not give criticism......the course promised to change people, it doesn't. It is dillusional, it is brainwashing....much like the 12 step programs, it is cultish.I am sick of this stupid politically correct society and things that support it. This book is one of them. Keep it and all of the other foolish books that try to change you.Be yourself and enjoy being an individual. To hell with Dale Carnegie."
1,Unavailability,"Why the heck is this book ""Not Currently Available"" on Kindle version. This has been the second book I have wanted so far that has not been available in kindle version. Thought the point of me buying a kindle was so that I don't have to buy hard books and have them all stored in my Kindle. This is irritating."
3,Outdated for 2011,"This book was written in 1937 at the end of Great Depression and is outdated for 2011.The attitude, behavior, perspective and response of people have changed in this digital age. Most of the suggestions or advice in the book will not hold good!"
4,Classic.,"Somewhat outdated, but Dale is the pioneer in this field. Has some good points. Suggest you read it."
2,old news,"really old news,,,to make a friend be a friend....huh? well its a basic, basic book on the Golden Rule treat others the way u want to be treated, only that basic message is flawed. Guy buys wife big screen TV, she will hate it, Wife buys man Make Up ? this misses most of the relationship issues, Men clean the house and garage and yard. Wife will love u for that."
2,the book is very small,"must admit I was disappointed that the book is very small and the paper quality very low, I should have expected this because of the low price but I couldn't tell the paper print from the picture of it. Glorianne Carignan"
2,Repetitive,I think you get the idea of his philosophy after about 1/3 of the way through.Wasn't interested enough tofinish it.
4,"good , common sense read...","An enjoyable classic about ""people skills."" Much of what it says is common sense, but it does organize and remind the reader of the importance of key approaches to relating to and persuading other people.The author uses a solid framework and builds specific points around it. He then uses examples from famous people like Lincoln, Socrates, Napoleon, and Theodore Roosevelt as well as from ordinary folks who shared their experiences in his classes.Overall, a good read."
5,Great Read,I really enjoyed this book. There is definitely a lot of good information to be learned here.
4,A good book for what it is...,"Lots of people love this book. I learned a LOT from it. I know what it takes to win friends and influence people. My moral dilemma comes when practicing what the book preaches. Read this book and then read ""The Fountainhead"" by Ayn Rand, and maybe you'll realize what I did."
3,Must translate into a modern day...,THis book has fantastic basic tips. But you must keep an open mind since it was written many years ago. Times have changed but the basics can be relayed into today's business world.
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"LOVE IT!! If you seriously go back to this thing every now and then of course, it will make a difference, because you'll be more cognizant of the wants and needs of others a little bit more."
5,A Classic,"I have read this book early in my life and late in my life, it is truly a classic read. It should be read several times and by everyone. Clifford A Mitts III"
5,Be a Better Leader,"While this book is essential to salesmen, it is far more important to people with responsibilities as leaders of families, at work and at play."
4,Very Good,"This is still a timely book. Just one caveat: this doesn't work on those with anti-social folks with severe personality issues. This is not therapy! Take great interest in what anyone tells you. True most folks are NOT interested in what you have to say. But, they will if show that you care."
3,Pivotal book in creating modern American culture,"Carnegie has some great ideas here, although I think Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a much better book. As I read I kept thinking about where Carnegie's ideas led--to a culture of ""making nice"" at all costs and never confronting failure. The ""make nice"" culture which is prevalent today sinks companies, universities and cultures. When Carnegie lauds Lincoln for not confronting his general's failure to decisively end the war after Gettysburg, he effectively says it is better to lose thousands of innocent lives than to tell a general he has messed up! Carnegie says everyone needs to feel positive about themselves. This is true. But there are 2 choices for a leader and mentor--spurious praise vs. helping someone achieve. The emphasis on being interested in others in order to get them to do what you want also made me feel a bit queasy. There is no social conscience to the book. It will probably help you to get ahead in life, though."
4,"Keep what works, ignore what's irrelevant","Reading this book is a bit like sitting down and having a conversation with your grandfather. Much of what is said is still relevant, but a lot of it you politely listen to all the while thinking ""wow, this guy really has no idea how things are nowadays.""Still, the good outweighs the bad. Much of the rules Carnegie talks about are fundamental rules that probably will never change.I've used many of these rules in my personal and professional life and can say that for the most part, the book is still worth reading."
4,Must Have For Success - (www.TheSuccessVault.com/review.htm),"This is a fantastic book! It is somewhat outdated, but the principles outlined in the book aren't. I have been using the principles for over 13 years and about 2 -3 times a years I reread the book and learn something new that I can apply in my life. This book is only one of a few in my collection that I keep coming back to over the years and it has contributed significantly to my success.To anyone wanting to get started on the right path of success, this book is ""Must Have"" and ""Must Read"" for years to come.My best advice is to plan to read this book 2 - 3 times every year for the rest of your life."
5,Life-changing Read,"This book was one of the most life-changing books I've ever read! It will help you learn to relate to people in a more complete and helpful way. Althugh the title turned me off because it sounds like a book on manipulation, it really is a great book on how to make successful connections with others."
4,Superficial but good,"I have re-read this book about a million times and keep it in the bathroom for re-reading. I now find it superficial, as I'm currently reading Secrets of Consulting by Weinberg."
5,Excellent insight into effectively dealing with people,"I own this book and actually went through a once monthly seminar for a year/ Dale Carnegie training. It opened up my eyes to how we treat others and the perceptions of other people. Something as simple as remembering a person's name can make a big difference to that person. Carnegie's book is full of great tips on how to make a positive influence on others, and make them actually want to follow your lead, instead of following you because you are their boss. Great book."
4,A Must Read,This book is an old book but is still revelant today if in a business that deals with people. Dale Carneige's material is timeless.
4,Outdated anecdotes but highly relevant behavioral analysis,"This ws an easy read that took less than a week of casual reading. Some of the stories from the '30s are a bit hokey and seem dated, but Carnegie's insight into human nature is deadly accurate. I've already employed some of his principles in my professional and personal life with outstanding results. I'm going to re-read the book. I think that habitually putting his recommendations into practice could significantly improve anyone's situation."
4,Insightful!,The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it tells one too many stories and doesn't suggest more ways to becoming this wonderful person. Basically it says to be nice. But I loved all the ideas.
4,Well Written,I haven't finished the book yet but it definately motivates you to better yourself and be a more positive person. I recommend this book to anyone.
5,Life Long Learning,I have lost count of how many times I have read this book. It's more like a dictionary reference for me than a reading book. I keep it on my desk and review it weekly.
5,Classic!!! One of a Kind!!!,"This book have a world pool of valuable information on human relations (what can be more valuable than that). Not the kind of book one would just read, put down and forget about it. I haven't finished it yet, I'm about half way through it (cause I'm reading each chapter twice before I go to the next) but I'm pretty sure its gonna just get better. I'll write a final review when I'm done."
5,fantastic book.,The book is great. The seller described its condition perfectly.I Would highly recommend using the material in the book. It's stuff we all know and don't practise.
5,A must read.,What a fantastic read -- strategies to apply not only in business but at home with your kids !!I would recommend it to everyone!
4,Time-tested and practical advice,"This book's title caught my eye some months ago during one of the trips to the bookshop. Is it really possible to win friends and influence people? I have a keen interest in psychology and motivating others and needed some quick, practical suggestions on doing things. I decided there was no harm in buying the book and reading and seeing for myself. The book was just 267 pages and I was sure of going through it in a few weeks, reading at a leisurely pace.This is an incredible book! If you are keen to improve your relationships with other people in your professional and personal space, this could be the book for you. While reading it I have been trying out some of the things it suggests and am truly amazed by the results. I have already decided I will read the book again."
5,Mandatory Reading,A book that should be read by everyone over 16 but even moreimportant follow it's advise.
5,A Masterpiece on the Subject of People Skills,"Man is a social being - unless one chooses the way of the recluse or hermit, he will inevitably have to interact with people. Strangely, for most people who never encounter this book, they miss out on one of the most important keys to achieving happines and prosperity in Life.It's been proven that success in any field is related MORE to ""people skills"" than to mere ""technical know-how"". And, NO-ONE has put together the principles by which these skills can be acquired better than Dale Carnegie."
5,Fail safe strategies here,"I have read this book many times and each time I get more out of it. Skills for dealing with people can be learned and this book gives you fail safe strategies. You won't be disappointed with this book. I also recommend Optimal Thinking - How to Be Your Best Self to show you how to be your best self no matter what you are up against -- abuse, silent treatment, insincerity, selfishness etc. Read each of these books to be your best and bring out the best in everyone you deal with."
5,Equal to Bible.,"Awesome book, must read for every human being......the world would be a lot batter place if every one had read this book.- Sriks"
2,"A ""Classic"" Despised","I was recommended this book by a fellow professional as a must-read. His boss was a strong believer in the theories presented in this book and found it useful to read and re-read this book. In fact, I am probably the target market for this book as a person who needs to develop his social interaction skills and leadership style.While I find the study of influence and leadership fascinating, I am not interested in this book. I found this book to be extremely annoying. The book is essentially a string of anecdotes that the author uses to illustrate his points - techniques for managing people, getting people to like you, influencing people, and being a leader. There really aren't any facts behind the material. You either take to it or you don't.In this field of study, I personally enjoyed Cialdini's Influence: Science and Practice much more. It offers a better balance between the academic/scientific evidence and anecdotes which illustrates the principle."
2,How to be a good salesman,"I did not like this book. I acknowledge it is a smart book, full of practical advice to go up the ladder and get what you want. And, most of all, people still find it useful for their careers. But the title is misleading: it doesn't teach how to make friends (no book could be useful at that), but how to make good business deals. The anecdotes are fine, but the overall feeling I was left with is that the book tries to teach how to manipulate people without the others ever noticing. The message is cynical and extremely cheap: ""Cheat and deceive, and you'll get a better position in an American corporation"". There are better, deeper and funnier books to read."
1,The sender has not won friends and influenced people,"I ordered the above book the first of September,""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" and as of this date have not received book. The sender has not influenced me."
1,Buy friends and coerce people,"This is a very funny book. It's not meant to be, but the ideas it tries to put across are machiavelian, childish and short sighted. The underlying theme is that one should do favours for others in order to receive the same from them: hardly a theme to build friendships on.If you are currently paying people cash to be your ""friend"", you might find significant financial savings from the ideas in this book: you could be paying them in plenty of other ways.It makes a great gag gift: you will find yourself passing this around to read out loud at parties."
3,It's either this or hardcore brainwashing..........,"How to influence people? one may ask....This book will work for 30% of the world population. This 30% is already socially skilled and able to control people, they can use this book as an outline of etiquette.If the remaining 70% wants to learn how to influence people they should join the Jehova's wittnesses, Landmark or even better, get involved with Scientology. Here they will really learn how to pressure peoples thought processes, have the morality of a shark and become numb to any counter-argument. Then it won't bother you if you call people on their wedding day or on their fathers funeral to sell them something, you'll get the deal closed!I also heared the government is busy constructing devices to electronically control people with some remote device.It's all in the power of the MIND......"
1,How to win friends and influence people,Newver received trhe book.coild use some help to get it...I'm sure I was charged. Not happy to say the least.
1,Wrong Book Delivered,"The book I ordered is not what was delivered. I ordered ""How to win friends and influence people"". The book I received was ""How to win friends and influence people for teenage girls."" This not what was shown when I ordered online nor in this review. What a disappointment."
4,How to Win Friends and Influence People,"This book is a classic. I would recommend it to any aspiring professional, student, teacher, or simply someone who values the power of effective communication."
5,Dale Carnegie Book,Easy fast purchase - great book for anyone and especially for people involved with sales - or just dealing day to day in life with people.
5,Great Networking Possibilites,"First published in 1936, this is one of the best self-help books ever published with 15 million copies in print. This book touches on the fundamental techniques of handling people, six ways to make people like you, and twelve ways to win people to your way of thinking. Remember, people do business with people they like and people they know.Melinda EmersonAuthorBecome Your Own Boss in 12 Months: A Month-by-Month Guide to a Business that Works"
5,A MUST read!,"I have read this book several times. It is a must have for any one in business or the service industry. There are many famous quotes which can be used daily. Will continue to read and refer to the ""Masterpiece""."
5,If only...,"If everyone in the world read this book just once, it would be such a more enjoyable place to live in..."
4,Great Content,"Content, most valuable but condition, undesirable. Was this book picked up from the junk and then sold? Sellers must have a conscience; it's not always about the money, even though it was really cheap. I guess, I got what I paid for."
5,Still the Best!!!,"I love everything about this book and you will too. This book is amazing even for someone like myself who has years of sales and personal relationship building in my past. He teaches so many important thing in this book here is a few of my favorites. Remember to always use a person's name when talking to them. Research their personal interests and talk about it to them and finally, encourage them to talk about themselves and their interests. This book will definately help you improve yourself and increase your sales if you're in that line of work.Ty wilde author of""Everything I Touch Turns to Sold (Advice on How to Become a Top Sales Professional From a Top Producer)"
5,one of the most powerful books i've read!,"this is a VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY good book.. i can't stress it enough it's power. it is easy to read, straight to the point and very inspiring."
3,About the greatest psychologyst and his book,"I think that every person on this planet shold read this book becouse it may show us how to comunicate to each othe rand to have good will.Also, i have opinion about the author.He knows how to lead the people to the path of succes.And he knows that the good will can make good progress."
4,Great read!,Never realized how much info could be learned about people. I find myself analyzing others in how they handle people! I wish I had gotten the more recent addition.
3,"In a 12-year old's head, it ain't too good.","My papa bought it for me, and It is an adult book. My papa was sad that I don't want to read it, and my mama yelled at him for buying it, but I read it anyway, and i got about 1/4 of what I was suppose to get out of it. If you are older than me, go for it!Thank you daddy!"
1,I can neither win friends or influence people after this bk,"I bought this book. I read it. But still, no one listens to me. I just sit there. I tried doing what the book said. Smiling. Shouting. Gladhanding. Patting men on the back. But I'm no good at it. This book is premised on the suggestion that it will help you. Well it sure didn't help me. I am so sad and lonely. The book made me feel even more isolated. Maybe this book will help you, but it didn't help me. Worse than before. Sad. Lost."
1,Wasn't worth the pages it was written on.,I read it a few times when i was a teenager and there was nothing helpful in there. I'm just thankful someone else bought it for me & i didn't waste money on a book that tells basic stuff we all already know.
1,NOT the book Dale Carnegie wrote,"Dale Carnegie's great book, How To Win Friends and Influence People, is practically unrecognizable in this revised version. Carnegie's quaint language and examples have been ""updated"", much to my dismay and the book's detriment. If ever there were a time to leave well enough alone, it was this book."
5,Get the original only,"'ve read the 'revised' edition and didn't get much. I found this one and realized that 're-edited' books should not be done. The lessons in this book have been continually reduced down to one 'don't get the e-book version.' Reducing these rules down is like taking the 10 commandments and saying 'Ah, let's make them one.' You don't do this to a classic. Get the original version or don't bother."
1,Amazon's Quick Ship Books,"Not the item I expected...wrong picture, used book, writing on pages. None of that was in the description, very disappointed in this purchase. I would have returned it if I didn't have to pay over half the price I paid for the book. As for the actual product, I haven't gotten around to reading it yet. The book I purchased from Amazon went to a used book store and I will buy a better one from a different store."
5,Great Book delivered fast,"For those that don't know the book, it is a must read for anyone who deals with people in any way. Whether managing people, selling products or just being a member of a community, everyone can benefit from reading this classic."
4,Recommended for anyone looking to improve their communication skills,"A lot of this book could be considered ""common sense"" as most psychology is but it is very helpful to put a finger on why certain communications tend to be more successful than others. The best part of the book is its straightforward layout and the authors effective use of summarizing the main points to drive them home and make them more memorable. Some examples for each principle are less satisfying than others which is the main reason for taking off one star. Overall the book is quite effective and I would be surprised if most people did not pick up at least a couple of ways to improve their interactions.I recommended this book to anyone looking to improve their communication skills."
5,Book Review in 37 Words,"Classic human relations book for anyone wanting to improve their personal and work relationships; try applying these principles during family gatherings, casual social events, work meetings, or any environment where having a friend could be a benefit."
4,Wanna build your network - listen to Carnegie !,"Winning friends and influencing people is not an easy thing. Are you gregarious? Do you want to be a networking juggernaut? You should listen to what Dale Carnegie says.""Do you want to get the attention of others? Watch out what actors do in advertisements and movies"". This is such a simple technique that we all fail to recognize in our day-to-day life. ""Do more listening than talking"" - hmm, another simple technique. Carnegie explains how you can win friends and influence people, with a lot of stories.This book is a must-read for those who want to build their network."
5,Really Fantastic,This book exceeded my expectations which were pretty high given all the great reviews! It is a quick and easy read and very practical advise that you can implement in all areas of your life.
5,Surprisingly Easy Read,Found this book very interesting & I think it will be helpful. I downloaded it to use with my direct sales business.
5,Must read,Want to get anywhere in life? Read this book. Those who are trying to win by intimidation have got a harsh reality awaiting them. Those who deal thru honesty and integrity will always rise to the top. Learn how to work with people not use them. See which way gets you more people in your corner.
5,I liked the book and found it most useful.,"How to Win Friends and Influence people is the most usefulbook I have read in quite a while. Carnegie uses anecdotesabout famous historical figures to get his point accross andshow his techniques at work. Since finishing this book, Ifind myself using Carnegie's techniques in everyday life withgreat success."
1,Kindle edition is rip off,$12.99 for the Kindle edition or $10.20 for the paperback. The paperback can be resold which reduces its effective price even further. So much for passing along some of the cost savings of not having to print an actual book. The Kindle version is such a rip off.
5,Great book.,"What I found in this book is every day knowledge. Weather some people say that it is a book on how to kiss butt is beside the point. I was getting into all kinds of trouble at work, because I did not know how to play the game. I use the book daily and carry it everywhere with me. Now I am one of the most liked persons at work. I dont care if I do kiss butt, I will make it to the top by using everything in this book. I HIGHLY recommend this book for people who are in a job where they have to play the politics game."
5,great book,the book is great. it came in great condition and shipped fast. this book is a great read but if you have a smart fphone just get the electronic version sent to your phone.
5,Excellent Book A MUST Read for everyone!,"Since I started reading this book, I have noticed that a lot of the stuff that is written in this book, I already practice. What is so neat about it is it gives me a better understanding of why I do what I do. If you are wanting to learn how to make new friends or want to better influence people than you need to read this book. It gives you all the information you need to have a better relationship with the human population!"
4,Interesting,"Very interesting book. I think this is more written from the sale person perspective as thegoal is make every person like you, and I don't think that should be always the case."
3,ok book,I read this book but not sure how much it helped me. I did learn a few things on how to treat people to make them feel important.
5,How to win friends and influence people,This is a fundamental book of behavior and interactions. It's message is essentially timeless. I particularily enjoyed the references to historic figures and a time gone by.
5,Used in my Masters Thesis,"Although this work is over 70 years old it is still a truly inspiring classic. If we all took heed of the lessons in the book we as a whole would be a better society. I used much of what I learned in and referenced to the book in my Masters Thesis.Best wishes,Donald Ryles PhD, CHAuthor of Hidden Secrets of ""Many, But One"""
5,simply a must,"This book presents a new philosophy of life, so you make the people around you feel happy and feel happy yourself. His ideas are extremely convincing, as proven by quotes from the brightest people of this century, quotes that one could not find after reading 10 books of philosophy or psychology. This book is very well-written, very comprehensible, deep in meaning and shows you how to live. Again, this book is a must to read. If it can be compared in terms of monetary value, its real value is much more than ... for sure!"
5,Excellent Book!!,"Not since I read Ayn Rand ""The Fountainhead"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"", has such a book influenced me as much as this one. I think it's great that after 70 years since it was written, I can pick this book up and feel like it was written yesterday. The philosophies in this book are so smart that it's hard to believe that we all don't know and live by them."
2,Don't judge this book by the cover,"I ordered this book based on the cover - assuming that this would be a case by case synopsis of various murdering moms. However, I was wrong. This book is like reading 1000 articles from a medical journal. It is definitely not for casual crime readers such as myself. The vignettes are a paragraph long at best then dissolve into various author opinions on what is wrong with the state of our social service departments, society in general, fathers today, poverty, and on and on. I was really surprised by the Susan Smith case review as the author seemed to completely miss or purposely disregard the fact that the real motive for killing her children was prompted by her dream of a new life with a rich man at work. I do no think her vague unnamed personality disorder was the main factor there. Not recommended."
1,Need a reality check,"I work in the field of abused children. I felt this book did not hold the women accountable for their actions. The author's basically gave them a ""free pass"" in life by making excuses. It does not matter if you are rich, poor, abused....you took a life ( a very innocent life that could not protect him or herself ).In addition, they did not go into enough detail with the stories they presented. Basically, they gave a few lines regarding a case, and that was it. I think it would have been better to have spent more time on a few cases including all of the history."
3,Not worth the price asked,Don't buy the Limited Edition set. Not worth the price asked. See my review for the standard boxed set (much better value) elsewhere.
1,Disappointing,The movie started out with promise and some humor but became too unrealistic and finally ended with a boring plot. Too many stereotypes and not much humor.
4,Cute holiday story on a reservation,"This is a charming holiday story set on a reservation and winter resort. There are no big-name actors, but there is a pretty decent plot involving a big misunderstanding between the struggling resort owner and a would-be lover who may or may not be writing a travel guide and evaluating the resort secretly. Nice locations, gentle humor, nothing gross or violent. Decent viewing for adults and seniors."
5,Great movie,"This is an all-around charming holiday movie with a great cast and wonderful soundtrack.The plot is not new, but the characters are interesting and make it fun to watch. All actors seem to enjoy their roles and there is good chemistry between them.Overall a movie that makes me feel good every time I watch it.Extra-points for Wes Studi's cameo appearance and Graham Greene as The Chef!"
4,Warm and Fuzzy,"Though no one need worry here about an Oscar nomination, this is a very sweet and funny film, and it treats Native Americans as real persons with real issues, not as some sort of stereotype, either ""good"" or ""bad."" I also know some of the bit players, who are members of a Grammy winning Native American singing group here in Alaska, so I may be a little biased."
4,lasting time.,"i really enjoyed this item, music is excellent. I am a disco music fan and love 12 inches versiones, so I enjoyed most of the songs but unfortunaltely some of them seems like they dont last enough to apreciate the art work that some of the mixes have.Would love to receive more information about the collection, sometimes is not posible to know the songs that each volume has.Armando"
5,This Book.......,"Helps make reading fun. I also think it's cool how she looks up to Ruby Redford and I think we can all learn something from this book! This book is funny and cute!-Sixth GraderNewport Beach, Ca"
1,Cannot Possibly Imagine Reading This Entire Thing,"I had to put it down by page ten; I cannot imagine anyone caring to read something so overflowing with the word ""utterly,"" and when the words started spiraling around the pages, forget it. It may work with easy picture books, but not for juvenile fiction. Also, the story line is vacuous, at least the first ten pages! Sorry--this one is not worth the effort."
4,Good for the money,"I have had this system for a few weeks now. I have it hooked up to an old television, so I am not getting nearly as much out of it as I could with a better tv. Overall, it is an upgrade over the tv speakers and makes watching DVD's more fun.One possible drawback is that the speakers are hooked up to the sub-woofer, not the receiver. I don't know if this will be an issue down the road or not.For the money, this is a decent system."
2,To the point!,"Poor sound quality. After five months, tray has started sticking. I contacted Amazon, hoping not to get caught in the manufactures black hole of 'after a month its your problem' and was surprised that someone from some special unit(in amazon) would give me a call to work something out. NEVER HAPPENED!!!! STILL WAITING!"
3,To answer a qyuestion,"The song at the start of the movie, where ""Beck"" is beating up the football team is Get your freak on. Missy elliot"
2,help?,could someone please email me the name of the song at the end entitled 'run that'. if u know it email me at danzheffron@hotmail.comcheersdanny
1,Where are the tunes?,The movie was good but the soundtrack was missing the soundtrack. Does anyone know the name of the gunfight song that has rap and guitar riff?
5,Help me...,"Can someone please tell me the name of the song that is playing when ""the rock"" is beating all those guys up in the bar at the start of the show."
1,Sucks,"This soundtrack sucks it doesn't even have any ""real"" songs on it. All it is, is a musical score not worth the money."
4,¿Did Harry did it Again?,"The Rundown is much a very different scorefrom Harry's past soundtracks. A few of the themes of fast pace tracks have a familiar effect as in Enemy of the State and Spy Game, but not too noticeable. The jungle theme was successfully introduced into the style of the movie.The score is doesn't have as much power driven in his previous works with Trevor Rabin and Hans Zimmer. But the flow and melody is necessary for the feel with the film.It is a very mellow soundtrack, most of the tracks are very easy on the ears.Dwyane Johnson followed his father, Rocky Johnson, in his footsteps into wrestling entertainment. Rocky was an mid 2nd generation wrestler in the business."
2,Just the musical score...,"After watching The Rundown I immediately went to buy the soundtrack. I wish that I would have looked at the songs on the soundtrack first, because I got it home and felt ripped off. It was just the instrumental score, none of the actual songs were on it. Yes the score was okay, but I wanted the songs like: Run that, The boogie that be, Get your freak on, etc. But no not a one of them on it. So read the song list before you buy this soundtrack."
3,Lead Into Gold is a Decent solo effort....,...from Paul Barker of Ministry. More of a dark electronic typesound with vocals. Booklet has lyric sheet & artwork. Six songs:1. Faster Than Light2. The Stripper3. Beauty4. Idiot5. Blackened Heart6. Hatred
3,Acquired Taste,"This is some funky action... Who sings Gospel and of killing people with cement shoes on the same album? Although there is a wide variety of sounds and emotions, I wonder if the album could be better focused; You know, either kill them all or be normal... He seems to enjoy walking the line, and yet his own deeply imbedded contradiction may undermine the existance he seems to be maintaining. A plant fighting a lawnmower? yeah."
3,Not as funny as I expected,"I was told that the play ""The Royal Family"" would be hilariously funny. I must say, it seemed somehow outdated and the jokes were not funny at all. I do not understand Tony's character. The character development is poor, except for the authors' development of Fanny Cavendish. Don't bother reading through this waste of words!"
5,REAL FUNKY GROOVY WORLD!,"I love Cate's music world. It's new, sexy and sophisticated sound. Every time it makes me feel good!"
2,Sony invents a User Interface that actually opposes you.,"This is a fine single disc player... But add the complexity of actually cataloging some discs and this thing falls far short.... If your discs happen to be encoded its alright. But if they aren't, it is a tedious process at best.If anyone borrows a disc from your player, watch out. Its so helpful that it starts resorting the discs for you. This after you hand edited a bunch of work...What is needed is an iPod for DVD's... This stinks.Sony needs help in the software department."
5,300 +1 Sony DVD Player,"Awesome storage capacity. Sony. Does it get any better? I don't think so! It is so nice just to be able to scroll through your movie list and not to have to mess with jacket covers and the like. Here is a little tip, I keep the covers in a plastic 8 1/2 X 11"" sheet protector in a three ring binder for reference. Not that much difference in price. Definitely worth it!!"
1,optical sensor,"I have purchased the CX 860 and have purchased two of the CX875P and all of them continue to have the same problem with the opitcal sensor going bad (the sensor that reads the dvd). I have had two of the units already repaired and they are broke again and the last one I purchased 6 months ago just broke last week and now I am sending that one in to be repaired. I am tried of repairing these things. I was smart this time and bought the extended warranty on the dvd player, but the previous two I did not. I wonder why they want us to buy that extended warranty? because they know that these things are crap. I was told it was just bad luck (from a Sony Rep) that all three have had the same problem.....I don't think it is bad luck...I think there is something wrong with these dvd players"
1,Very disappointed in Sony,"I can concure with all the problems everyone here has attested to. I have taken it back for repair of the optical sensor twice and it still does not work all the time. Its software is really bad (speaking as a programmer). After more than one disappointing evening in which we could view a rented DVD, my wife is ready to through this out the window."
4,Good,The cup holder looks very nice and it fix perfectly in my boat the onlyproblem it's the rubber liner became loose with the heat as soon as we start it using it. Good for the price.
3,A lot of Bossa not Enough Nova,"I was pleased with the selection of songs, but Joyce just didn't totally move me back to my time in Rio."
1,poor quality purchase,"This costume arrived very quickly. However, the quality was not worth the price. The material was shoddy, the workmanship was poor. This cost $50. including mailing. I could have made it for half the price and it would have been much better. I have since seen a similar costume in a store for $20. I doubt that my grandson will even wear the thing. It's probably torn up by now."
2,Costume just ok,"My son was so excited to be Pikachu. However, the mask for this costume not only sits on top of the head, like the picture shows, but it made of flimsy fabric. My son didn't feel as though he looked like Pikachu, and didn't wear the mask part - he wished the mask had been the plastic kind. He wore the costume a few times before Halloween, and the seam between the neck and shoulder ripped, so it was pinned Halloween night. For the price they charge for costumes nowadays, I expect them to hold up a little better."
4,cheaply made but you can tell that from the picture.,This costume served it's purpose but the overall quality was marginal. We didn't have any issues with it but it wouldn't take much abuse to tear this costume.
2,Not too good...,Hat did not come in a good shape...its ears never stayed up as in picture... Quality is not good! I wish I could have seen the back of the hat on the display picture since its not a fully rounded hat!
4,Cute pikachu,4-year old wore for Halloween to go with his brothers Ash costume. This costume wasvreally cute and went well over his snowsuit for trick or treating. The ears don't stick up like in the picture but he was happy to wear it.
5,Victor Borge is Great!,"This video is a classic. I knew I would enjoy it because I had seen it years ago, but it was just as enjoyable and funny today."
4,From the inside flap,"A steamy store of deception and desire as two lovers discover that an arranged marriage can sizzle with more heat than a Texas night! She was a pampered Mississippi belle who had never know a single day of hardship in all her twenty three years. But now Skylia St. Clair was desperate. Why else would she have advertised in the newspaper for a husband? And here he was, galloping onto her newly inherited Texas ranch a handsome, sweet-talking rogue Skylia couldn't trust or resist. The ex-Rebel soldier and con man took pride in his deceiving art. Now, in the booming post war west, Braxton Hale intended to make the biggest killing of all. He would play the groom the lovely lady wanted, right before he stole her land and hightailed it to the richer horizons of California. But that was before Braxton held the sweet,sensuous Skylia in his arms and discovered a woman he desired far more than gold."
2,A cast of thousands made this book a challenge.,"You had to figure out the ""who's on first"" and which character is this, etc... The original premise sounded good but too much ""stuff"" got into it. The characters were well written but its hard to do justice to 5 larger than life personalities in one little book/story."
3,Better than the competition.,"The best I can say about this product is that it's superior to the dictionaries available for download on the Palm platform--but that's not saying all that much. The interface needs improvement; the definitions do not include tips on the pronunciation of words; and some words are either missing from the database or are only half-heartedly defined. For the price, which is at least double that of the download-able dictionaries, I was hoping for more. Having said that, this product does indeed work--I'm a college student, and the dictionary contains the majority of the words I've needed to look up, including some obscure and technical ones. This product is, for now, the only dictionary out there that's worth spending money on. Despite my three-star rating, I'd recommend it to any owner of a Visor that is looking for a dictionary (this product is MUCH better than the Noah program)."
3,Good definitions but lacks color and user friendly interface,"I've just got my dictionary module and I've been playing with it for a few hours. It's nice but I was waiting for something much better than the Freeware Noah dictionary. There are no colors and the font options are even too small or too big. The shortcuts are also useless. If you want to go back you have to use < and > for forward. It is very hard to do those symbols in my Visor and I think hardware buttons shortcuts would have been much better. The interface looks boring, like a DOS shell with not colors or anything. The only good thing about it is the search feature that looks for words that are similar to the one you entered if misspelled. I hope they release an update for this module."
2,needs improvement,"The idea of having a dictionary as big as the one advertised in this module is great. How many times have you wanted to look up a word only to stop yourself because you didn't want to open up that huge book? Even for those of us who have internet connections to look up words easily, sometimes we are not around the Internet and would like to be able to look up a word on an airplane, train, or bus, etc. The problem is with this module is the implementation. The navigation is poor, and even if you don't use it at first, you will want navigation in it lately. I would wait until Franklin releases a better user interface."
1,crap,"Worked ok for 2 1/2 months then...nothing. no seperate ff/rw button, too few inputs...very few outputs...poor rear speaker volume...disappointing! open and closing drawers problematic. I have a 15 year-old JVC 4.0 that works fine....this p.o.s. went back to the factory."
2,Good but then,"Its looks pretty good given its specifications.My major complaint about this system is, I could hardly heard from the Back speakers and hence missing Surround sound effects of Dolby Digital.And then little inconviniences are,1. No direct ""Fast Forward (>>) / Backward (<<) feature. We need to select System Menu and go to the submenus to forward.2. The IR sensor is bottom of the unit at an angle facing down, and had trouble opertaing the remote when the unit is placed in Entertainment center.3. The disc selection is slow."
1,The Rocky of the ballet,"Mr Villella in this book try really hard to potrait himself like Rocky Balboa, but instead to became a boxer became a dancer. 90% of the book he critizice Mr Balanchine, and at the end declare his eternal love to him, no wonder thanks to Balanchine he have a book out and an artistic directorship in Miami. He repeatedly mention his troubling relantionship with Mr Balanchine because he never like Mr Balanchine's classes, I wonder how the situation with classes in Miami City Ballet?"
4,Flawless writing - flawed writer,"In my youth, Henry Miller was IT. He's a writer's writer, and his prose is surpassed only by Graham Greene, in the English language. That's something no one can take away. However, as I matured, I found that Henry Miller did not. He is in some sense the quintessential New York writer - a complainer. Quite harsh on people. At this point I consider him something of a tragic figure, who wasted enormous talent. If you look about, he is ignored in the literary world today, which is a sad legacy."
5,One of the Best Books about Greece,"This is one of my favourite books about Greece, and I've read lots. I didn't expect too much as I don't care for Miller's fiction, but here he writes elegantly and perceptively about Greece. He captures the spirit of the Greek people wonderfully, a bit like Zorba the Greek does in fiction. Although it's been around for ages, it hasn't dated that much and I'd put it alongside Lawrence Durrell's books as among the best descriptions of Greece you'll find."
3,Un Muy Extraño Retorno,"Primero que nada aclaro que fui y sigo siendo un fiel seguidor de Hombres G. Fueron mis heroes en la secundaria y el primer concierto de Rock al que asisti a mis ya lejanos 15 años fue al que milagrosamente hicieron en mi ciudad (Reynosa, Tamaulipas en Mexico). Bien, ahora no recuerdo detalle por detalle cada una de las canciones pero en general creo que al disco le falto fuerza por mucho. Despues de muchos años de ausencia, mis expectativas eran diferentes... algo mas parecido a ""Esta es tu vida"" (sera que esta era de Dany Mezquita) o mas profundo que lo que entregaron esta vez. Quiza sea yo el culpable por esperar un disco mejor logrado, pero en mi opinion este es un disco exclusivamente para fans nostalgicos... ojala vengan mejores entregas si siguen juntos."
4,Timeless classic -- why isn't it still in print?,"I grew up making things out of this book as a child (my mom had it leftover from her school teaching days). I ordered this used copy for my own, and I realized how classic and timeless the activities and crafts are. The ideas are terrific and use things commonly found at home -- which makes for a great frugal resource, too. Love this book!"
1,Two Thumbs Down!,"This book is so outdated, it made me wince! I wish I had been able to skim it before I bought it. As a Girl Scout leader and a mom, I thought this book would come in handy. Wrong! After going through it cover to cover with my daughter, we only found a handful of activities that we half-heartedly thought we'd try. Poor percentage for a book that was originally titled ""838 Ways to Amuse a Child."" I have yet to use the book for any activities. Definitely a waste of my money."
3,Cute and soft...,"This cat is cute and soft, but it gets boring quickly. I played with this for only one day, so did my sister (she got a grey one). It seems to be more for littler children so they can learn to care for pets. But, all it does is ''meow'', blink it's eyes, and turns it's head. All the fur real friends I had got boring quick."
4,Fun and Adorable!,"My cousin has the black and white kitten and it is soooooo cute! But what I may want to warn you about is she has a cat (it's a real cat,not a fur real friend) and it knocked it of her bed and it landed face first and the head isn't working great but it still works properly! To make it work, she justs lightly pulls the face. Other than that, it is really cool!"
2,stuffed animals are better.,"try to think, what would i do with this? what fun is it? what could i buy the same price,but better? roboteck toys make you play what they want to play.On the other hand,stuffed animals,you can play what you want when you want.thats what i would perfer."
2,I can't read this,"I checked out the ""look inside"" feature and realized there is no way I could ever read a book that has every other word underlined for emphasis. It's insulting and ridiculous."
1,Obnoxious Cover,"The cover of this book is very, very obnoxious to me. Maybe it is meant to be funny? But for me it's silly, petty, and a complete joke..Not to be taken seriously..Instead, for mental toughness, I went ahead and bought a couple of Self Discipline/Mental Toughness books from Ex-NAVY Seal members. At least I know they have had some tough experiences.This kindergarten school master image on the cover of this book, must change if I am to buy any Daniel Teitelbaum books."
5,one of the greatest !,This is one of the greastest reggae artist I have heard in a long time.Comming from the dirty south this is one you need to pick up. You will not be disappointed. If you like bob marley you will love ( MAJOR RILEY - THE UNTOLD STORY ).LOOK THE ALBUM IN A STORE OR ON LINE !
1,"poor packaging, product arrived broken twice","I ordered this product as a gift. When it arrived, the glass pot was shattered. I sent it back, and when the new one arrived, the pot was cracked. The company does a poor job of packaging the coffee maker. It arrived in a box without any protective packaging. I asked for a refund."
3,Three Stars is Enough!! Two would be honest! jb,"This Box is simply a collection of loose vamp jams that seem to drift into an obscure wash after 10 mins. I had to wonder if Miles would have wanted Sony reissueing everything he recorded in concept package boxsets? Hey, he yelled at Teo for putting out Quiet Nights!If endless simple grooves are your thing and you don't like songs structures, then drop the bread on this box. (app$72)But if you want options, The Silent Way & Bitches Brew Boxsets are excellent: no tears lost there!That said, I think DJs are going to have a field day sampling the repetitious grooves off this one,(haha).Cheers Jazz Lovers, jb"
3,music school,"This is more interesting as an accidemic exersize than it is an essential addition to your library. Yes, the music here is reasonably good to brilliant, but listening to take after take of each number, for four discs in a row, stands as an awfully tall order. Hearing this, I feel like I am back in my high school jazz band-albeit with the best musicians in the world-learning material from scratch.These were, of course, the Complete Jack Johnson sessions, so Sony did have to play the hand the vaults dealt them. And the work on the last disc may make it worth the price.But all the other Complete Miles box sets are rich with mountians of great music. This takes a lot more effort on the listeners part.Buy it only if you are a die hard fan."
2,This isn't the good Jack Johnson,"Jeeezzzz, I bought this thinking I would hear classics like ""Bubbletoes"" and ""Holes to Heaven"" but instead all I got was some bing bings and bang bangs and some guy blowin his horn all over the place, sheesh."
5,Great Music,"Purchased as a gift for an older friend, she absolutely loved the CD and listens to it often and says it brings back great memories."
2,Definately a no go!,"This was rather a huge disappointment. There is virtually no color in the tapes, this is not a compelling series keeping you glued to the plot. It was rather painful to try and finish watching the entire set of videos with such poor quality. I dont think I could recommend it to anyone because it was so boring and implausible. The only saving grace was the superb acting ability of Sir Anthony Hopkins who benefits any movie with his flawless performances"
2,YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED - DEFINITE NO,I am a fan of Masterpiece Theatre productions as well as British drama and that's why this was especially a HUGE disappointment. Poor color quality and poor sound throughout. Fairly boring story. Possibly could of salvaged it if the actors didn't put you to sleep. Tedious to watch. Marketing this as starring Sir Anthony Hopkins (as I see Amazon has done) borders on fraud. He doesn't make an appearance until Part 11 - halfway through tape 5. The set is a total of 6 tapes. Hopkins was the only performance worth your time. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
4,Gianna: aborted and Lived to Tell About it,This is just an amazing book! I can't believe how far Gianna has come. It makes you want to hug her and tell her how brave of a person she is.
2,Space junk,"Space Ace is in the line of Dragon's Lair and other similar point and click game play. I am not against this genre completely but it has some inherent problems. Timing is crucial to beating the game and is rather unforgiving. This leads to starting over numerous times, watching the same animation sequences over and over. I didn't find the animation scenes to be all that good or interesting; in fact some of them annoyed me. Even after figuring out the right moves to the game, I didn't enjoy much of it, which is always the key factor. On the other hand, some may enjoy the tough challenge that Space Ace presents and an interesting ride. If you enjoyed Dragon's Lair, I would say you'll find this to be an exciting outer space adventure."
1,excellent should have been 5 stars .computer error,"ive read all these reviews claiming the story is lies backed up by the other 3 stooges books out there ...whos to say they aren't lying? is it really because they came first ,they must be true? this book has been on the market for quite a few years now,and some people say the author should be sued?..... have you ever looked into the people comedy 3 does sue for using 3 stooges material? an artist for recreating images on tshirts ...you know they have by this time seen this book ,yet no lawsuit,wonder who is scared the truth may come out? ive read comedy 3 is claiming curly was jerome howard, i have a vhs of the 3 stooges that ive had a long time that has moe larry and curly ,and featuring jerome howard .. how could curly be both people ,some of these neigh sayers might research some of the older 3 stooges material and compare it to the newer releases it might be a real eye opener for them"
1,Totally a fabrication,"This book has to be a total fabrication. First of all, note the lack of saying it is Curly Howard she is talking about. There is no mention of that. It is all about ""he was a stooge"". Sorry but that reeks of somebody not wanting a lawsuit.Secondly, it is common knowledge that Curly was sickly, and left the short movie business being replaced by Shemp and died shortly after that.I am mad I bought the book thinking I would find out what Curly did after he couldn't to the shorts anymore, only to find out somebody wrote some book that alledges all this stuff.For those of you that wonder why this is not on TV, you should figure like I did that this is the best book of fiction written about a person you could ever read.It is a good yarn, but remember the facts. None of this could have happened."
2,The Curly Falsehoods,"The Author of this book should be ashamed of herself for trying to make money off the great name that was Curly Howard. I hope she is sued by the families of Curly Howard and Moe Howard for writting this c**p fantasy. I having read the book, ""Moe Howard and The Three Stooges"" written by Moe Howard before his death in 1975 was more than a little upset to read the obvious lies and discrepancies in her book about Curly. I would of prefered a boring truth about Curly's post Three Stooges days than this garbage. If you had ever read any other book by one of the Howards or Fineburgs (actual relatives to the Stooges) you would know that this is someone just trying to make a buck off a well loved comic genius who cannot defend himself against these lies. Shame on you."
1,unbelievable,"i gave this book a 1 because a minus 10 isn't possible. this is the worst excuse of a book that i have ever read. not only is it insulting to a beloved comedian and his family, it is unbelievably poorly written. if the author is really a teacher, we are in a very, very bad way. there are spelling and grammatical errors on every page. even the shoddiest vanity press has editors!other reviewers have questioned why the Howard family hasn't sued. i would guess it is because in order for their suit to be successful, they would have to actually get some money. i doubt that this has been a hot seller and i am telling everyone i know to save their money.I do hope, though, that Larry Fine was paid handsomely for the use of his name! This would be funny if it weren't so pathetic. save your time and money for any one of the number of other books about the stooges. this on is a bust."
1,Awful.,I have no idea what this person is saying. But it is possible she believes it. The CIA conducted experiments with mind altering drugs and she may have been one of the guinea pigs and just doesn't remember. That's the only explanation I could give for such a nutty book. Avoid.
2,Pure Baloney!,"This book is an interesting read, if you consider it a work of fiction. It is similar to Forest Gump, where a fictional character is placed into historical events. In this case, the author is trying to rewrite an actual person's life and thread it into a story. The story is unbelievable, but, as I stated, if considered a fictional work, then it is somewhat interesting."
2,Bogus but amusing,"After reading a couple of chapters, I was mystified. Fictionalized biographies can be interesting, but anyone who knows anything about the Stooges would realize this book was totally nuts. Curly's from a wealthy Italian Catholic family from Georgia? He doesn't have any brothers, just sisters? So I came to read the reviews, and they are hilarious! That's why I give 2 stars, not for the book (-3 stars, poorly written & edited. Marriage vows are ""scared""?), but the reviews (5 stars).Many of the reviews do an excellent job pointing out the nonsense, but it also amusing to see that some people actually think Curly's real name was Larry Fine. (So who was Larry? Shemp?) Or that Curly wrote the Godfather, or knew about the JFK and RFK assassinations.The page [...] says that the book is actually a fictionalized account of Frank Sinatra, and that they changed to a story about Curly to avoid getting sued. (Apparently, it's better to get the Stooge people mad at you than the Sinatra people.)"
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"This book is represented as a tell all book by Curly's daughter. It is not accurate in any way. For starters the book suggests Curly was involved with the Italian mafia and was somehow connected to J. Edgar Hoover and John Kennedy. Curly Howard died in 1952! Based on what I have since read, every part of this book is a fabrication. It's not funny or clever. The book is poorly written and a real disappointment. Amazon should consider pulling this book or rewriting the description so it is not represented as a non fiction book. According to the book, Curly was involved with Jack Ruby and the Kennedy assassination 11 years after his death. Maybe Elvis was his accomplice?"
1,Hmmmmm,"If you are a Three Stooges fan, you won't like this book. If you are into fiction, maybe you will. It tells a story of a woman's relationship with Curly. They never tell you her name or give any verification that this information is true. What a farce. I actually ordered it a long time ago and only got through a portion of the book, never finished it and forgot most of the story...thank goodness!"
3,"Unique, I Guess","This book intrigued me at the beginning, because I was a Three Stooges fan and had read just about anything I could get my hands on that was about them, in life, as well as on screen. I kept seeing family names mentioned in this book, and didn't seem to understand how that could refer to the Howards, or the Howitz family. To the end of the book, I couldn't figure it out, now could I understand how people who were noted as being of Jewish decent, in this book appeared to be Catholic.However, those inconsistencies (and others) aside, the story itself was very well done. I think it could have been better (and certainly unique) if the author hadn't tried to weave in real families (like the Howards) or with the author of the Godfather.I was disappointed that the story couldn't have been true, since it obviously wasn't, but if it hadn't been about one of the Three Stooges, and if Mario Puzo's name hadn't been mentioned, I think it would have been a much better book."
3,interesting read,"I just laughed at most of this book because it was way too far fetched to be true. It was an easy read, though, but I didn't believe any of it."
5,"N'yuk, N'yuk, N'yuk! Curly was no knucklehead!","I read this book twice! I have read other books about Curly, but this one showed a side of him Hollywood probably didn't even know! The first time I read it I was so amazed I found myself smirking in disbelief. Then, I started hearing recently uncovered practices of J.Edgar Hoover that was parallel to what was said in this book, and well, I started to see how this could be true. I read it the second time and am now throughly convinced this story had to be true. I might read it again!"
1,Hard to believe,"I read the book and I find it very hard to believe.I read a ton of other books on Curly which seem true.This book claims Curly did not die in the early fifties but in the seventies. But Curly did die in the early fifties as there is proof!This book does not even talk about Curly's famous brothers, Moe and Shemp, his strokes, nor his real wifes!I think this book is only a ""work"" to make money off of the famous Curly name."
1,Unbelievable on all Levels !,"I can't believe someone would publish this as a fact based story. It is so far from the documented truth about Curly it makes me crazy. Don't publishers check sources anymore? If you make up a story like this, at least have the guts to call it a Novel not a fact based book.SM"
5,what if?,"To all those disbelievers, what makes you so sure this story is not true, if it is all lies why doesn't the horowitz family deny it. Is it really Curly in the grave behind the horowitz parents, that one critic of this book talks about, maybe it's not the real Curly! My guess is if this woman were lying, she would be sued or someone would deny it, I believe it, and I believe she does have proof if asked for it"
1,Amateurishly written,"Besides the fact that it is purely fictional, this book isn't even well written and I sincerely doubt there was a legitimate publisher involved. There are typo's or misspelled words on nearly every page and the style is similar to something you might read by a 7th grader. Don't waste 3 hours of your life on this!"
1,What?!?!,"I beg Three Stooges fans to not purchase/read this book! I have been collecting Stooges-related items for many years and assumed this book would be worthy of adding to my collection. I am greatly ashamed to have paid money for it! If you are a casual/beginner fan, PLEASE do not take this complete fiction tale as fact! There are many other reputable, non-fiction Stooge books out there...just look at some of the other reviews...there are many wonderful suggestions."
1,Absolute garbage,After about 10 pages I thought I was reading about somebody else. This woman is basically insane. The only thing I can assume is that this lady has had a fantasy relationship with Curly. It is an outrage to the 3 stooges and their families. Where are the time zones? Curly walking around Tampa and Los Angeles supposedly after his death and nobody notices?The author should apologize to the Howard family and everyone else involved with this hideous book.
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"Not only is this piece of trash full of lies and nonsense, it's poorly written to boot. I should have read through some of the online reviews, but I ordered without doing so and wasted [...] bucks.Some of the foolishness this book claims: Curly was an Italian from the Deep South (he and brothers Moe and Shemp were born and raised in Brooklyn, hence the accent 'soitanly' and were sons of Jewish-Lithuanian immigrants); Curly was involved with the Mafia and knew beforehand about the JFK assassination (though Curly had died in 1952); and Curly lived until 1975.And while you're reading these ridiculous claims, all the while you're wading through bad punctuation, bad grammar, and an overall sloppy and clumsy writing style.Read the books by Moe Howard and Jane Maurer instead!"
5,mezcla de exitos,"Shakira nos mostro sus abilidades con este album, ahora tiene mas variedad, con un poco de Alanis Morrisette mezclado, el cd tiene un sabor unico, Rock Latino en la forma mas pura. Este CD es para todo el mundo, por eso, todo el mundo lo debe tener. Great mix of rock, dance, pop, and latin, awesome cd, the lyrics, music, producer, all lead to one of the best in '98. BUY IT!!"
5,Her Best Work to Date!,"This disc is far and away the best work that Shakira has put out to date. Blending classic rock with her own Lebonese sound, she captures a unique sound that I have not heard anywhere. Add to that her falsetto voice and you have one of the best discs I have ever heard! I would love to have her translate this disc to English and let the American audience really appreciate her talent!"
2,shakira? que broma es esta?!,"la verdad es que no se que trata de demostrar esta vieja, en sus canciones se pueden apreciar varios fusiles de otros verdaderos artistas como radiohead, porque no me digan que en su cancion INEVITABLE no fusiló la parte tranquila de la bateria a la de HIGH AND DRY de radiohead, escuchen atentamente,comparen y se daran cuenta que son identicas. juzguen ustedes."
3,Donde esta su talento?,"The first cd I bought from Shakira was MTV Unplugged, and that was her best so far. Going from that cd to Donde Estan los Ladrones? was a disappointment. It's relative, I guess: I tend to like live albums better than studio projects. Off the whole CD, ""Octavo Dia"" and ""Ojos Asi"" were the best songs. My advice to someone interested in this cd would be to buy MTV Unplugged instead, as the two albums have basically the same songs on it except for ""Estoy Aqui"""
1,I love this cd (yo estoy enamorado de este cd),"Shakira is the best rock singer right now. This cd rocks. Even if you don't speak spanish (I think it's about time you gringos start learning to speak spanish or else you will be way behind into the next millenium)you will like this cd. This cd (Donde estan los ladrones?) and the other one (Pies Descalzos) are very good. Shakira is very talented. She writes all of her songs and she is original to her music. It's not just rock, it's a mixture of pop fusion, reggae, and romantic songs. This colombian born singer has SOLD over 7 million cds of her 2 albums. She will even become more popular to the ""english speaking audience when she does her crossover in the year 2000. With the help of Gloria and Emilio Estefan she will be bigger than Ricky Martin. Just wait and see. So I recommend that you buy this cd. It's very good. Every song has their own meaning."
5,Alanis Morrisette from Colombia,"Wow, this was just an amazing sight of things to come from modern South American artists, forget Ricky Martin, this girl is amazing. Aged about 21 (I think) she wrote and produced all of the songs in her own unique way and has a hint of Alanis Morrisette, but it is a very easy to listen to albun, and it doesn't matter if you don't understand the words."
4,Exelente pero como que le falto algo,"Este es un disco muy bueno y recomendable para aquellos que ya conocian a Shakira o para los que apenas empiezan a conocerla. Pero todavia le falta un toque de magia que tenia ""Pies descalzos"" quiza ya no es tan critica o callo en baladas mas interacionalisables en vez de trabajar menos el producto y mostrarlo mas crudo. Quiza se sobre vendio el primero y este ya no suena tan fresco pero es igual muy bueno."
5,ESTE DISCO ES LO MAXIMO ESTA FREGON,"Sinceramente quiero decir que el disco esta fregoncisimo que shakira es unica y espacialmente ella es 100% autentica, es la mejor sus canciones son lo maximo ok bye atte: Tania"
4,Shakira's Best CD Ever!!!!,"A great blend of rock and pop, Shakira has a fabulous CD! Her voice can sing softly to soft songs yet sing to fast upbeat songs also. She has many good songs on the CD including ""Ciega Sordomuda,"" ""No Creo,"" ""Que Vuelvas,"" ""Si Te Vas,"" and ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones."" She reminds me of a Hispanic Alanis Morisette with her voice and guitar going with her rock/pop songs. Her album is definitely for music lovers who like rock and pop. As for non-Spanish speaking people, I strongly encourage them to listen to this CD. Although they may not understand the lyrics, they will love the songs."
5,Speechless....,"Words CAN NOT describe how amazing this CD is. I am a 14 year old boy who, on a trip to mexico with my school, heard Shakira on the radio. On getting home, I downloaded all of her songs, bough ALL of her CDs, and bought everything on EBAY I could get my hands on. I took out my spanish dictionary and went through EVERY song translating it so that I could understand all of these beautiful words. Everytime I hear ""Tu,"" I can feel the pain in her voice... and though I have never before cried during a movie, song, etc., I feel like crying everytime I hear it.THIS CD IS THE MEANING OF MY LIFE!"
4,"IF YOU LIKE LATIN ROCK, YOU'LL LOVE SHAKIRA; IS INTENSE.","JUST RECENTLY I BOUGHT THE CD. AS SOON AS I PLAYED IT I KNEW I WAS GOING TO LIKE THE SONGS. THE FIRST SONG WAS MAGNETIC, AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING SONGS. SHE EXPRESSES WHAT SHE FEELS AND HOW SHE FEELS IT. HER WORDS ARE THE REAL KEY TO WHAT HER MUSIC IS REALLY ABOUT. THIS CD IS MY FAVORITE AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
4,STILL HOLDS HER OWN,"Even though her lyrics are all reworkings of the same theme - devotion to a love that has been lost -, and this can wear one down a bit eventually, Shakira's beautiful voice and grittier electric rock mixed to dance beats hold their own through many memorable melodic grooves. Final track, middle eastern influenced ""Ojos Asi"" is a masterpiece, whilst opening track ""Ciega Sordomuda"" is delightfully catchy, if not slightly quirky."
5,"Unexpected Beauty, Rhythm, and Movement","Si es cuestion de confesar, no esparaba que me iba gustar tanto este CD. Pero al fin, no pasa un dia que no lo escucho. Su voz, las letras, la musica, todas impresionantes e infectuosas. BRAVA SHAKIRA!"
5,Music that represents America's multiethnic heritage,"Latino music, rock, country western, and Arabic influences are all heard in this CD. What a great example of America's multiethnic culture. Assuming her command of English is better than Enrique Iglesias', I can't wait till this artist comes out with a crossover album in English!"
4,I don't know Spanish - I just LOVE the music!!,"A colleague introduced me to this CD a few years ago, and I just love it. The music is varied, creative, and fun, fun, fun. When Laundry Service came out, I was excited to hear more from Shakira - and in English! Hurray! But alas, as one of amazon.com's reviewers says about Laundry Service, the lyrics are disappointing; they sound like they were written by a high school girl. If the lyrics on Donde are just as bad, I don't want to know...I'll keep listening purely for the music."
4,Shakira - Donde Estan Los Ladrones? Japan Edition,"Very good Japanese edition of this album ""Donde Estan Los Ladrones?"": 11 tracks in addition to the standard edition comes with exclusive bonus tracks for Japan Only: Ciega, Sordomuda (12 ""Full Mix) and Ciega Sordomuda (Radio Edit) . Item very scarce and highly recommended."
5,what a talent,"Before she was commercial and shallow and English speaking, Shakira was an amazing, strong, independent, unique, talented voice - - she wrote her own music, is much better in Spanish, and has such soul and beauty and is totally en fuego on this album. I listened to it every day for a year, and it spoke to me even though I was only learning Spanish..."
5,One of the best CDs I have ever owned,"I was first introduced to Shakira when her first alblum came out in Spain. I was instantly hooked ever since to her beautiful lyrics and powerful voice. Es un sueno mio verle en concierto, donde sea. Espero que la viene pronto a los EEUU."
5,Music to undulate to...,"Although I am not a fluent Spanish speaker, I find it very easy to understand Shakira's Donde Estan los Ladrones? My minor education in the Spanish language may be part of my understanding of the lyrics to the songs, but I rather think Shakira's emotion in each of the songs is what makes them easy to understand. The songs also have a great variety, from love ballads, pulsing songs for dancing, to songs so smooth they could put you to sleep. I especially enjoy ""Moscas en la Casa"" (Flys in the House). It is a beautiful and tortured song."
5,the long awaited new album is totally outstanding. The best,"Shakira has outdone herself. We feared it would be impossible to make anything better that Pies Descalzos but, evidently, with Emilio Estefan's production, Shakira has entered the BIG leagues. The words and music are very very good and its recording is really proffessional"
1,Major disappointment,Pura basura. What has happened to Shakira? The best song on this album does not compare to the weakest of Pies Descalzos.
1,YOU &#65533;LL DIE BECAUSE OF THIS,"THE WORST MUSIC I`VE EVER HEARD, IS AS EMPTY AS A TRASH CAN, I THINK SHE SHOULD DIE AND LEAVE US ALONE."
5,Original and Outstanding,"Everytime I hear this CD it takes my breath away. The last track ""Ojos Asi"" is a fabulous blend of latin and arabic influence."
5,holy smokes this is one of the best cds ever,This cd has it all. Shakira does a great job writing plus each song has a completely different feel. On this cd there are virtually NO BAD SONGS. I've found only one song slightly boring and on occasion I do actually want to hear even it. Shakira has an awesome voice too that really reflects the moods of the songs. If you are still wondering about this cd than i have one more thing to tell you. I wouldn't say i don't like music but i am not a superfan that can't stand not having music on. A lot of times i buy a cd and listen to it for a month or two then never again. This is one of the cd's that is in my permanent folder. It just never gets boring.
5,Very different.,"When I first heard this girl, I was amazed. Her lyrics are so clean and deep. Even though she mostly sings about broken hearts, she delivers tons of feelings in her songs, even in the one where she is very bitter and wishes him hell with ""the witch that ""he"" will soon discover doesn't brush her teeth"". It is very sad that she is compared to Britney Spears. No offense to Miss Spears but Shakira does have a brain. Shakira is not your ""airhead"" pop singer. She has something smart to say. The girl is truly beautiful and her voice is powerful. The songs in english aren't as deep or beautiful as the ones in spanish. The spanish ones have that ""feeling"" impossible to translate."
5,Gringa can't get enough...,"My Spanish is getting pretty decent, and I always tell people that I learned Spanish from Shakira. Why? Because this CD and the first one are so damn perfectly beautiful that I was inspired to whip out the Spanish dictionary and make sure I understood every song. There isn't a bad song on it, but my favorites are 'Moscas en la casa' and 'Si tu vas'. I hate the Morisette comparison. Maybe more like Mazzy Star crossed with Patti Smith and a little PJ Harvey, all put to a dance beat. Whether or not you speak Spanish is irrelevant. You will love it, and, somehow, you will understand."
5,Lo mejor de Shakira!,"Este es, sin duda alguna, el mejor CD de la cantante colombiana Shakira. Su éxito se comproba por el hecho de que canciones como ""No creo"", ""Ciega, sordomuda"" y ""Inevitable"" figuran entre las más oídas en el mercado americano. Su indicación para el ""Grammy"" como mejor albún de Pop/Rock Alternativo demostra que este CD es realmente el mejor de Shakira. Enhorabuena!"
5,This Cd is the best,I dont speak a word of english but this cd is one of the best I have bought i listen to it every day!
1,Stay away from imports...,"I have been an Andy Williams fan since he came on the scene. I own many of his original phonograph albums. This CD does not hold a candle to any of them. The richness of Andy's voice is just not there, not to mention the quality/volume of the background music. I have found this to be true with other ""import"" CDs, i.e., Ricky Nelson's, etc. Sadly, anyone who gives this item more than one star has not heard Andy Williams at his best."
2,Misleading and disappointing,"This book pretty much reads like one long advertisement for Don Colbert's OTHER books. On literally every single page, Don touches very lightly on a topic, and then directs you to read another book he's written on the subject if you'd like to learn more. There were a *few* fasting facts, but nothing new if you've ever read ANY other book about fasting. I urge you to save yourself the eight bucks, and instead possibly check out The Fasting Path by Stephen Harrod Buhner, which is a much more interesting and helpful fasting book."
5,Truly good hymn music.,"I used to own the cassettes but they all went bad, so I was pleasantly surprised to find the collection available online in CD form. 2nd Chapter of Acts has beautiful harmony and Michael Ward has an incredible voice. If you're looking for a good hymn collection, this is the one to get. You won't be disappointed in the quality of the performance."
5,Excellent,"I had the cassette version of this collection. When it came time to upgrade to a cd, I looked around and listened to a number of hymn cd's, but opted for this one again in the end. Anyone who likes the 2nd Chapter of Acts will love it, but I think anyone who likes hymns will too. The harmonies are amazing. It sounds both traditional and modern at the same time, and it contains a lot of hymns."
1,CD player just stopped working !,"stopped working about a couple of weeks! Don't waste you money and time, seems nice, but failed to work properly"
1,poor product,"I received this item in June began using it in July and it has already not working. It just stops intermitintly and puases in the middle of the song. Sometimes it just stops for no reson. There is no place on Amazon where I can go for help, since the return date was July 11th. I purchased 2 of these, so I am now using my second one. I would never purchase this product again and I feel Amazon was not customer friendly concerning this matter. Not such a good idea buying elrctronics through the mail. :O("
1,spend more moneyget better radio,"The radio is garbage. Should not be sold. Spend more money and get a better radio. Sound is tinny. Tuning is very bad, station fades in and out. Screen protecting speaker fell off. You get what you pay for. Gave to lawn guy."
1,CD player Broke after 3 months - JUNK,"The CD player stopped working after 3 months.Piece if Junk, don't waste your money.Amazon's return policy is also useless, get something that has a year warrantee."
1,Tempramental!,"The radio works fine but the CD player only works when it feels like working. Sometimes it plays, sometimes it just spins for a second after you close the lid then stops. Sometimes the display works, sometimes it doesn't. It's very frustrating."
1,Doesn't Even deserve One Star,Got it in December; CD player stopped working in April and now the radio reception is so bad I'm tossing it. Can't provide paperwork for refund as it was a gift.
1,Very frustrating!!,"I bought this product so my 3 year old son could listen to music before going to sleep in his room. It is terrible. There is a constant hum as long as it is plugged in. The volume of the hum depends on how the power cord is angled at the back of the unit. The CD player never worked right. After a few songs there is a ""ER"" message on the screen. Most of the time I can't even get it to play a CD. I'm very disappointed. Don't buy this product."
1,gee try to get an answer,"Let's see - no manual, no warranty card, no electric cord, nowhere to order one from Amazon. Like buying lots of batteries.You get what you pay for"
2,Won't actually PUMP THE JAMS,"This thing is okay, but I could never really get it to PUMP THE JAMS, you know? Like, it would start to PUMP every now and then, but it wouldn't ever truly, consistently PUMP the JAMS up very high, which was disappointing. If you're not into PUMPING THE JAMS, this is a decent product, but if you're serious about JAMMING, avoid it. There are probably better JAM PUMPERS on the market that will more effectively PUMP THE JAMS.Coby, why can't you build a product that will actually PUMP THE JAMS? We put a man on the moon, Coby. Seriously, get your ish together and figure out how to effin' PUMP!Also, I think it scratched my favorite CD (NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC!: Volume 8)"
1,Don't bother with this CD player,"I got this CD player for my grandchildren to listen to stories when they go to bed. They also love to dance so I thought they could play CD's. They are only 3, so I thought this would be good for the price. You can BARELY hear the music! When I last visited, I got a CD and put it on so I could watch them dance, it was not loud enough for them to hear it. I asked my daughter if it had been like this since I bought it & she said yes, that it was loud enough for them to hear the storeies....since it is not too far from the bed, but that is all. Do not bother wasting your time this was a piece of junk."
1,Avoid this product,Player did not even spin up a CD out of the box. Only positive is that the radio worked. Save your time and get a Sony instead.
1,Junk,"I can say without reservation that this is the lousiest piece of electronics I've ever owned. After a few weeks of use it became nearly impossible to get any reaction when pressing the various buttons. Now you have to press them very hard, in a specific way, or for a long time to get the desired reaction. Sometimes pressing a button does something another button is supposed to do. Often trying to advance a track moves back a track, but not reliably! You can imagine how frustrating it is to not be able to advance a track when it begins skipping playing a perfectly clean and scratch-free CD. It hums audibly when plugged in and we keep it unplugged because we're worried it will burst into flames. I can't wait to replace this incredibly frustrating stereo."
5,A wonderful read for those of any faith,"I think some people wrote their reviews without reading the book. If you judge it by only the chapter titles or the text on the front of the book, you are really missing out. I was required to read this for a college class and I am very glad I got the chance to find this gem. For anyone interested in the life and works of Jesus or just love to read a good book that makes you rethink things, definitely check this one out."
2,way more expensive than it's worth,"This book is way more expensive than it's worth. It's the shortest book- more of a pamphlet really. Almost $30 for a book that's just over 100 pages, with one-inch margins??? Absolutely ridiculous. Someone's making a fortune off of all us poor college kids who need to read it for school. Wish I didn't need it for school, or it would be going right back."
3,strange but interesting,"I am not Christian, or even a believer. I'm researching a novel set in the 1920's, and this book was a best seller back then - Jesus as a ""Big Man."" Author says Jesus founded the most successful business ever, using no money and 12 misc. men. This book inspired the group called ""the Family"" whose members have infiltrated the highest levels of our government and big business. Their idea is that God intends all the wealth to be concentrated in the hands of a few ""Big Men,"" and He will tell them what to do with it. He hates gays, communists, and labor unions, and apparently doesn't think much of women. Anyone interested in how Christianity is used in this country to promote the welfare of the rich should read this book."
1,"This movie is awesome but please go to your local kingdom hall its free.Jehovahs Witness do not sell Bibles, movies,magazines","Jehovahs Witness do not sell Bibles, movies,magazines they are free. Nor is there Any offering plates that go around to collect money, and No one is paid. 1 Peter 5:2 Shepherd the flock of God in YOUR care, not under compulsion, but willingly; neither for love of dishonest gain, but eagerly. Also Matthew 10:8 YOU received free, give free. Also we all know Jesus was never paid and he was perfect , so how much more so would a inperfect man not be paid. Hope this helps. Remember if you want this it comes in DVD as well and free to the public. You will love it it shows proof how the bible came to be and all scriptured back up ENJOY"
2,System lacks true functionality,"I was very excited to use this system. When I recieved it and opened the box I could not wait to install it. Once I installed it and tried it out I could not wait until i sent it back for a refund.The Wireless system seemed OK except that I continued to get a sharp metallic spiking sound from the surround speakers. When anyone crossed the path of the transmitter the speakers would screech. It was horrible. To make sure that it wasn't just the speakers, I wired them to the receiver and the sound was better.There is no treble setting either. Most TV shows will have a high treble level and I have no choice but to deal with it. The system is great for watching DVDs but not for watching TV which is probably 95% of the use it gets. I would not buy this. There are better systems out there for the same price."
4,great for a small space,"might not be so good for a large space....volume is more limited than wired sets.....the wireless feature has limits that way. If you live in a small urban environment where you shouldn't be blowing your neighbors away anyway, then this is a great system for you."
1,Don't Buy This!,"My husband and I bought this for our living room and it was a complete disaster. First, we couldn't get it to work with our Tivo and cable system- the sound was distorted. We called the customer help line and after 3 hours- it finally worked... For about a month. Then, the dvd player began to play in black in white- in flashes- then go back to color. This was really frusterating-so we tried to get Philips to fix it, but they won't honor online reciepts for warranty issues. So, we took it to the local authorized repair service who charged us $50.00 to look at it- they determined it would cost $393.00 to fix the dvd player. This has been the worst electronics purchase we have ever made- stay clear of this product. We're going to toss it out and buy something else!"
1,POS...,out of the box the unit was DOA... i will never purchase another philips product. wait until you have to deal with their customer service / repair division. you'll never purchase another philips product.
4,Be the hit of the congregation,"This is the only module that I own, and the only one that I've been fascinated enough by to purchase. I really love it, and get the funniest comments about the functionality. When the pastor is quoting versus at lightspeed, I am easily able to keep up while everybody else just gives up. Tap. Tap. Tap. One feature it didn't have that I feel I was lead to believe it had was the capability to write extensive bookmarks. I would like to be able to associate notes with specific verses, instead I get a limited entry associated with the chapter."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I was very excited to get this module. I remember having had a franklin electronic bible years ago and I was hoping to have that convenience again. Unfortunately, the interface is abominable. There's no real concordance, and when you try to search, you can only do the Old or New Testament, and the presentation of results is lousy, and it always tries to search its topic index first. What a pain. I'll gladly settle for a software solution that takes up a couple of Meg, because this program is so abysmal. There are free solutions out there drastically better than this [$] module."
1,Product shipped not as listed,"This reacher may work, but I wouldn't know. It came in a 23"" size instead of the 16"" size I ordered and needed as it is for a ver short person and the 23"" size is too long. Over a month ago, I was told it would be picked up by UPS and a new one shippped. So far, nothing. I called again 2 days ago, had to leave voice mail message. Still no response. So, I'm out my money and do not have the product I need."
5,A Wonderful Book,"My copy of this book from my childhood in still in my bookcase; it's in a plastic sleeve because I love it so much and want it to last forever. I thought it was my own personal treasure and had no idea it was currently in print. On a whim, I googled the title and was so pleased to see it listed! This is such a wonderful book. Exciting story, great characters and the detail of the time period is fascinating. This book has a lot of heart and I appreciate how competent, interesting, and hardworking the two boys are throughout the book. I even named my cats Hugh and Dickon!"
3,Just went on forever,"I wanted to give a quick review on this book because of all the glowing 5 star ratings. I just don't feel that it warrants such praise. I read this to my daughter a few years ago so some of the story is vague to me at this point. I mostly remember that the book just kept plodding along and I was extremely glad when we were finally through with it. The plot was predictable to me and did not keep my interest (or my 12 yo daughters interest who generally likes adventure/middle ages type books). I would need to reread it to be more specific, but alas, that does not sound like a fun way to spend my day.On the other hand, my 13 yo son read the book at an earlier date and really liked it. So I am giving it 3 stars because he's a pretty good judge of books too. :-)"
5,GOOD FILM,"I liked this film. I guess I was being a bit prejudiced because I would've preferred to see someone mixed, Latin, or black in the lead. The performances are great though, dancing, singing, acting, except I believe they probably could've found a leading lady who could break dance better. But it's their film & they did it well. If I want one with a black, Native, or Latin lead I should do one myself. Hah! I believe you will enjoy this film. It does have a great message too without all of the unneccessary sex and violence. I feel like giving it 4 stars, but in all fairness it does deserve the five."
2,Not as good as the first one,"I felt like this movie had no plot line. The acting wasn't the best, and it didn't even come close to the first Honey. This sequel could have been much, much better."
4,A powerful eye opener!,"Ms.Fallaci does not mince her words and goes right to the issue of Islam and its' impact upon Europe,particularly her native country Italy.The shocking ease with which European diplomats have relinquished control of their countries in the name of political correctness and greed is disturbing.An extremely well written book which stands as a literary hallmark and clarion call to Christians in the 21st century.The"
5,Fallaci is supreme,The passion that Fallaci has for our disappearing culture should inspire us all. Unfortunately she died in 2006 - has anyone taken up her banner? I've yet to discover. Read The Rage first for a better appreciation of her fearlessness.
5,"A Lonely, Courageous Voice in the Wilderness","Forget the mainstream media, talk radio, newsmagazines, and all the rest. If you truly want to understand what is happening to Western Europe and its obvious Islamization, read this book. Like me, I think you will be astounded to discover the degree to which the Muslim faithful and their piteously naive, or not so naive, Western accommodationists have collaborated to change the course of our civilization in ways few understand. Oriana Fallaci has been villified for her honest portrayal of events, subject even to countless death threats. She is no longer free to return to her native Italy because she may be arrested and imprisoned for writing and speaking painfully honestly. This book simply must be read and understood by anyone remotely concerned about the future of Western Civilization. Multiculturalists, be forewarned: you are in for powerful condemnation."
2,No reason here,"Informative and inflaming book, but I see no ""reason"" here. Maybe because of the bad rap her previous angry book received, she chose a more calm title, but the content is anything but."
5,GOOD INFO TOUGH READ,"Anyone interested in understanding the extent of the Islamization of Europe will find much, specific information in this book. But, the writing style is something else. Instead of sentences, she frequently speaks in a series of clauses. It takes a little getting used to, but after a few pages, you get the idea. The language is dramatic with unusual comparisons. This helps."
2,Not very sturdy,Was bought for a toddler. She managed to break one of the buttons during the first week of play. Was a little stiff for the first few weeks which made it hard for the toddler to play with. She is probably too young for it - but an older kid with more strength could easily break more buttons!
4,Speedy service,"Received the accordion within 3 days (ordered on a friday, got it on a monday) and everything was in great condition. I was actually surprised by the speedy service since I selected regular mailing delivery. The bellows are kind of stiff, but that was to be expected.Even though it's a toy accordion it will take some patience for a child to learn how to play it. But with some practice they can get the hang of it. I recommend this for someone who wants to buy it for their child (recommend at least 7-10) or an adult who wants to eagerly learn the accordion w/out investing in a $300 one."
1,Fell Apart After One Week,"The accordion sounds great and is not too difficult to use. Unfortunately, it began to fall apart the first day. Now, after a week, one of the buttons has fallen into the accordion. Not worth the money at all."
4,cute for kids,"My 4.5yr old niece loved it! She wanted several pieces to complete ""her band"" and this was a great addition."
4,Fun Times,"Our daughter had been wanting one of these instruments, and we were lucky to find one. It plays real well, and is a little difficult for her to play it as it is a little to small, and she is only five. We were a little disappointed when the wife and I saw it due to its size. But she enjoys it so that is all that matters."
1,disgusted,A few years ago we purchased a childs accordian for our oldest grand-daughter. It was a nice size and easy to play. When we saw this one advertised we bought it for our youngest grand-daughter. It is tiny and extremely difficult to play. this toy would discourage a person from going on to play the real instrument. We feel we were ripped-off and would not recommend anyone buying this piece of junkthank you
1,do not purchase,this product was too hard to operate even for an adult. A child would loose interest in about 1/2 N.Y. minute.
3,not the best quality,"I got this for my 3 year old son, who loves musical instruments. The three little buttons fell inside after several uses. Not very kid friendly, even though my son is very careful with the toys compare to kids of his age."
3,"Great toy, but durable?","Our 5-year old really loves this toy. She loves pushing all the buttons and trying out all the sounds. The bad news is that she hasn't had it very long at all and already one of the buttons is pushed out the hole and inside the machine, rattling round in there. Very disappointing. Makes me wonder how long the other buttons will last."
4,Nice product,"So far so good...I was a bit surprised by the small size of this...just not what I was expecting (guess I didn't read the fine print)....but as it turns out, it is easier for little arms and hands to manage"
4,Another themed reference book,"These specific themed books are wonderful as references and Occult & Horror is no different from the rest. Hayashi once again covers a wide variety from human monsters, standard monsters, animal monsters, and how to create the mood necessary for a successful horror manga.This book is not for the faint of heart. The zombie was fantastically grotesque and there is a section on drawing dismembered body parts which may be unsettling for some folks. Not to mention the cool ghost scenes and other... umm yeah, if you don't like creepy stuff, then this book isn't for you. Otherwise, this book is mostly for reference."
4,Monster Mash,A great addition to any one learning how to draw creatures and monsters of nightmares of the manga world. I found the techniques within this book exyremly helpful in creating my own ghouls and creatures for my drawings. From effects as the ghost blending in with the background to the skeletons. It also has good ideas for fantasy creatures for you RPG fanatics out there.
3,good if you just want ideas,this book doesn't have much on how to draw characters but if you just want some ideas on what to draw if you want to draw monsters then it is a good book. it doesn't offer any real good instruction.
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"I got this book pretty much based on the front cover, I have to say. While that is my fault, it's misleading. I wanted to learn to draw nekos (cat-girls), which I couldn't find in the book. One thing though, there were some cool sections about Japanese mythology and monsters.I do like this book, it just wasn't as good as I hoped. I still look through it when I'm drawing, but I think only one picture (chibi devil girl) actually has any elements from this book."
1,contents not as cover depicts,"By the look of the cover you'd expect to be drawing vampire queens or ghoulish gilrs but instead it tells you how to turn a paper lantern in a ghost. Though there were some minimal drawing tips, anyone who's picked up a pencil before whouldn't consider them helpful. Good for the absolute novice only."
2,Its Horror i guess?,"it has alot about how to draw really boring monsters,cliche'd mostly, with little personality. A few pages contain zombies and dismembered arms but the majority did little to help me. Most of what the book contained had nothing that scared me. I mean they had vampires , werewolves, and mummies-all in a non horror style (it was really stupid actually) and each only covering one page. For drawing horror, i guess once again we are S.O.L."
5,Sam Peckinpaugh Masterpiece,"This all star cast Western is one of a kind. Personally, the action was so violent, that it sends an anti- violence message."
3,Wild Bunch (or why I hate directors cuts),"I first saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. Then I saw it in the 80's again on HBO and made a VHS copy. This is one of the best westerns (even though it takes place in the early 20th Century), ever made.Then I saw the directors cut. By spending running time 'explaining' unknown connections that are unecessary to the plot, you take a well a trimmed champion of a film and turn it into a crippled plodding dinosaur. The original theatrical release I give 5 stars to....this ""original"" directors cut, gets 3."
2,Leaving well enough alone--a cautionary tale,"What a disappointment! I am a long time Wild Bunch fan and finally got around to getting my letterbox director's cut, sat down before the tube after my children of tender years retired for the night and was totally let down. The restored materials add nothing, and in my view actually detract from the film. What's added, as near as I can tell, are a couple of cheesy scenes such as showing Robert Ryan's arrest in a whorehouse as Holden escapes (thereby detracting from the mystery of the Ryan/Holden relationship), some footage of the Gorch brothers frolicking with naked women, and some awful Cable Hogue-ish funny music to a couple of scenes. Stick to the original theatrical cut, but definitely in letterbox. Sometimes cuts are made for a reason and should be left to rest in peace."
1,Amazon Is Messed Up!!!,"Dear Amazon, Post this as I agree with the other person.With HD picking up in popularity, I would appreciate it if you could offer a way to filter DVD reviews so that we can see reviews that are HD-specific. I am not interested in getting an HD version of a disc I already have in SD if the HD version is no better in image quality."
5,The Greatest Western Ever,"This film not only broke the boundries and stretched(more like broke in half!) the rules for violent cinema, it is a GREAT movie. AFI obviously looked only at its influence on later pictures when they ranked it 80th on their Top 100 list. It has the trademarks of a true western, only backwards. You pray that the robbers, the anti-heroes of the film, will win the final battle scene, but you know that its hopeless. The bounty hunters represent the evil in the film, except for their leader, an ex-robber himself.Some have called it the best American film ever made, and that may be. All I know is it's a fine piece of film-making."
5,Wild Bunch - Blu Ray Reveiw,"I wont review the film. Its a classic that you'll either love or hate (I loved it). I'm only going to comment on the Blu Ray transfer aspect. Simply put, this a a beautiful film to watch on your new HD set and Blu Ray player. Anytime you see somone talking about how ""such and such film is an ok blu ray transfer, but since its from way back in the 90's, what would you expect"" just ignore that excuse. The picture quality and sound in this late '60s film is outstanding. Definitely worth replacing a standard DVD with. I like the suplemental features, although frankly I rarely watch the extra features of any DVD. I dont know what was on some of the older ""special edition"" DVDs of this title, so I cant compare."
1,* for DVD ***** for film,"Terrible print of a classic revisionist western. Grain all over the place, blurriness. This is definately inferior to the w/s VHS pal region 2 released in the uk in 1996. Dissapointing especially since it's one of peckinpah's best films as well."
2,Again with Quality issues.,"As before, the constant stops and goes drive you nuts. I watch Netflix all the time and seldom have this problem. Picture quality is pretty bad tooI keep hoping it will get better but it seems to be getting worse."
4,One of the best Western movies I have ever seen.,"If you want a very good western movie, ""The Wild Bunch"" is definitely the right one, one of the best Packinpah films I have ever seen. Top story with solid performances of Holden, Borgnine and Oates"
4,One Outstanding Western That Stands The Test Of Time!,"What an excellent film. The acting was absolutely flawless and the script and story-line were simply spectacular. When I saw this when I was 12, I was completely shocked at the extreme graphic violence it contained, particulary the bloody finale. Now at age 25 I understand that the violence in this film is really required to carry out the story, not like many movies today which simply glorify violence and gore. ""The Wild Bunch"" is Definently one of the greatest western films ever made. Own it today!"
5,Great Movie..Perfect Picture,"I can't say much about this Great Movie that others haven't said already . The Blu-Ray reproduction was exceptional. I put this movie in the top ten of any western ever made , and having it with the quality Blu-Ray produces is probably more than even Sam Peckinpah ever imagined. Now I hope others, such as The Outlaw Josey Wales , are released soon."
5,Best Western ever made!!,"This movie had all the greats. William Holden,Ernest Borgnine,Warren Oates,Ben Johnson,etc. An ensemble cast. All have sadly passed away. R.I.P. Ernest at 95.Sam Peckinpah's masterpiece still lives on 43 years later! Some of the best lines are in this movie. Everything comes together in this film from character development to the plot to the action sequences and loyalty among men. The actors and films today don't hold a candle to these classic movies and actors."
1,"After 40 years, I *still* hate this film!","I guess it's so beloved for the very reason I've loathed it: the gratuitous cruelty and violence. Sam Peckinpah must have been inspired by the early work of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali, on the ennui of existence. But Bunuel and Dali were surrealists. In this mishmash of mindless mayhem, Peckinpah indulges in ""brutal realism,"" if I must coin a phrase. From the opening shot of the children giggling over a tortured insect (it's a scorpion, a symbolic ""bad guy"", so it's ""OK"") to breaking a baby bird's wing, to Bo Hopkins gloating and giggling over helpless people he's slaughtered, I find this film seriously disturbed and must wonder at the moral sanity of those who rave over it. Presumably they were 1960s adolescents in love with effing things up for its own sake. Time to grow up."
2,Not so hot.,Don't understand the hype for this movie...thought it was a so-so western. Much better ones out there. Only buy if cheap.
2,wild bunch,"Some say it is a classic. A few lines have great thought about life & relationships with others. There are contrasting issus the about loyalty, values, commitment, friendship & going down in a blaze of glory. Sad to say it depicts the US military as inept. Some sections are found offensive. The stars are of course in a class all their own without a doubt. It seems a bit long & could have been improved if shorter in time & written better. Not recommended for immature audiances."
5,excellent,"eventhough is an old movie still it is a classic, excellent feature and the performance of the mayority of the actors were excellent.thank you...."
1,The Wild Bunch,I RETURNED THIS ITEM ON NOVEMBER 19TH AND I'M STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE THEIR RECEIPT CONFIRMATION!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Do They Get Lost in the Sandstorm?,"I had the pleasure to be one of the few who saw the first limited release full uncut version of the Wild Bunch here in Houston, back when it had an intermission just as the dynamite was about to blow up the bridge. There is one scene that I saw, that I have never seen in another released version of the movie, when they get lost in a sandstorm after having made their raid on the train. I wonder if this footage is lost, or if it does indeed show up in this latest director's cut of the film?And David Anthony, if you are out there and reading this, I've been trying to track you down on the internet for years (David was the hands down defacto expert on The Wild Bunch during my college years)."
5,Classic film and an excellent dvd set,"The Wild Bunch is Peckinpah pure, all the weirdness and character insight and fake blood you could ask for. One of the last great Westerns and certainly one of the most layered. Many truly great scenes make this a real genre classic.And not only is the film given its due with a very crisp transfer, for once the two dvd set is truly worth it. The second disc has two tremendous docs that any Peckinpah fan or noob will love, though be warned: they both contain many spoilers for some of Sam's best films. So watch his best films first and then see these for more insight and less spoilage.All in all, this is the sort of treatment every fine film and top director deserves, and it's nice to see this flick treated with the respect it's earned by remaining so beloved. And at 8 clams for two dvds it's a real bargoon."
2,Depressing violence,"Enticed by the rave reviews I took a look at The Wild Bunch. I was sorry I did. It is a long, tedious chase interupted by excessive violence and plenty of insults among those supposed to be companions. It has no ""redeeming social value."""
3,A Failed Epic,"Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch was released in 1969, the same year as George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, probably the best western ever made. The Wild Bunch lacks the subtlety and humor found in Butch and Sundance. Every character, whether Anglo, Mexican or Indian is a stereotype. There is plenty of action, but not a single character one can identify with.Peckinpah made a better western in 1973: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, with a score by Bob Dylan, who also appears in the film. The acting by Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn in Pat Garrett is superior to that of William Holden and Ernest Borgnine in The Wild Bunch, and the pacing of Pat Garrett is much better. The Wild Bunch, with a cast of thousands and nonstop violence, is just too long at 145 minutes with no breaks in the endless killing."
5,10 Stars!!!,"It's about 2 guys that are fighting the same battle against each other: Pike vs. Deke. A pair of ""Has Beens"" trying to make the final score. You just want them to hug and be friends again. But no! The director takes you, in every sense, to Hell, starting with the scorpions/ants and ending with complete destruction of everything. There is no escape for any of the characters. It extends the bounds of despair and self-loathing far beyond any film that I know. I thought the director's cut didn't add all THAT much to the experience. My reaction to the film remained the same after viewing both versions."
5,A classic for any film library,"William Holden's gang of 'just about over the hill' outlaws plan on making one big score before they hang up their guns and go straight. There's just a thing or two between ""The Wild Bunch"" and their plans: former friend, now informer Robert Ryan and his group of bounty hunters, and a band of about 1,000 Mexican soldiers...the odds are just about right!While some would argue that the film romances violence with its slow motion gun battles, ""The Wild Bunch"" also receives high marks for its character development and the inner-working of an outlaw gang hanging on to old western values at the beginning of the 20th century."
3,Overrated,"I cannot agree that this movie is among the best westerns of all time. This film is violence for violence's sake with little purpose behind it. There is so much and so mindlessly portrayed that it is boring after the opening scene. To my mind ""Open Range,"" ""Dances with Wolves,"" ""Silverado,"" ""High Noon,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""The Shootist,"" ""Stagecoach,"" ""They Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" ""True Grit,"" ""Cheyenne Autumn,"" ""Lonesome Dove,"" ""Fort Apache,"" and ""The Man who Shot Liberty Valence"" are all much better westerns. At least those come immediately to mind. I'm sure there are more. TWB isn't a bad film, and Edmund O'Brien's performance is above his average presentation. I didn't even recognize him at first. But alas, the film just isn't great."
4,Good but overlong....,"i rented this directors cut and i did like the movie. The cinematogrophy was great and i loved the Mexican scenery. The acting was very good. But the directors cut is way to goddam long. studios must realize that unless there is extra violence we could care less about added dialouge. i dont. i want to see the original version that must have been a hell of a lot better. not to say this was bad. it was good. The legedary end saved it and brought it all together. basically its the gang members vs. 100 mexican guys with guns. truly a great shoot out and one of the ten best ever put to film, right up there with the climax to A Better Tomorrow 2. its that awesome. btw i rented this because John Woo said this was an influence and after watching it i can see why. great slow mo death scenes. watch the movie"
2,Overrated Macho Bore-fest with ZERO sense of humor and wit,"Technical qualities aside and leaving out the excellent final shootout scene which slow-motion blood-ballets its way onto a higher artistic plane, the ENTIRE rest of this film is MEDIOCRE AT BEST. Not only is it NOT the greatest Western of all time, and not even close to being one of the top 20 Westerns ever made, it's not even Peckinpah's best Western (that honor belongs to ""Ride the High Country,"" a much less bloody and far superior film).And even in the action scenes most of what Peckinpah did was to take the already hugely popular Sergio Leone level of violence, magnify it, and squirt some blood in the air in super-slow motion, while leaving out all the humor, lunacy, and imagination that makes Leone's films so great."
1,Disappointed by the quality of the DVD,"I am very disappointed by the quality of this DVD. I bought it with my eyes closed because I actually loved the film. I fully agree with those who consider it a masterpiece, but... I wish I could have my money back. The letterbox format is an handicap for those like me that like to enjoy movies with a projector, but even on an average tv screen the quality of the picture is pretty bad. (The number of stars refers to the dvd and not to the movie)"
4,New 2-Disc Anamorphic Edition due in 2006,"I hope the new 2-Disc edition will correct all the wrongs from the prior one. It should be available January 10, 2006."
5,See This And Mourn the Death of a Genre,"Sam Peckinpah gave the western the greatest epitaph/euology with this film - no Western since is so stylized, so seminal, so sentimental, so powerful, so damning, so controversial.Willima Holden gives one his best performances ever - right up there with Jake Gilles in SUNSET BLVD. and Sefton in STALAG 17. Why are there no actors like Holden today? A hopeless cynic with a heart and morale code, and as Dutch in THE WILD BUNCH he crystalized his screen persona. The rest of the cast is stellar too, Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan anchor the film and film this spartan film with the gravitas that is rarely seen in a Western.Any director to use high-speed camerawork in an action scene owe a debt to Peckinpah and this film, and its the lastest time we saw this kind of relentless, psychotic blood-shed in a mainstream film in an unapologetic way and is still considered art - at the highest level."
1,Beware - not Mac Compatible,Nice product but specifically notes AFTER you open the box that the software and hence the turntable is not Mac compatible.J and R say they are going to add this info to their website and agreed to pay 50% of my return shipping charges - disappointing
