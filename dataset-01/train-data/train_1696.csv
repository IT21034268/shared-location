1,DOES NOT WORK WITH MARIO KART,"BEWARE EVERYONE. this is not used to play mario kart double dash with people around the world. My boyfriend and I just bought this a couple of hours ago, only to find that this is not what it is used for. It's purpose is for 8 of your friends to bring over their TV's and 8 game cubes and hook THOSE up. It says right in the Mario Kart Double Dash handbook that there is no internet hookup for this game. BEWARE, don't make the same mistake we did!!! It's only purpose is for 8 people to have a full screen game against eachother instead of a split screen game!!!"
1,"Wait, Nintendo doesn't have online play? or does it?","Corny title. But I will keep this short and sweet, I will buy the GCBA a.s.a I get any LAN possable games. Oh, and the 1 star is only b/c I haven't reviewed it yet. But as many peeps know Warppipe is software used to connect LAN games only with your IP and router. I can even say this, If you use a wireless router (like me), you can't play it like that. You need to use the main router in your house. Oh, and those who say that WP is crap, this is only the bata version and not the offical version, ok. Oh yeah, there is another online game comming out. You can look it up on walmart or here."
1,"A cruel, cruel hoax.","Thanks for nothing, Nintendo. Here we are over a year after the release of the broadband adapter and only one game can be played online. Let me repeat that, ONE GAME. Nintendo seems to be intent on burying this product as it and Phantasy Star Online are both very difficult to find in retail stores. There are many current and coming GameCube games that would have benefited from online play but none of them will. To Nintendo's credit some games do support LAN play, but that requires multiple GameCubes and TV's hooked up together in a single location, an unlikely scenario. We can only hope the Warp Pipe project will allow us to legitimize the purchase of this poorly supported peripheral."
4,good product but difficult to install,"This pet door replacement flap is a very well manufactured and designed product, but it is very time-consuming to install. The directions are relatively clear, but aligning the screws when you cannot really see where they are going makes it a somewhat frustrating experience. The door itself works very well and is quite sturdy."
2,"Nice door, BUT.....",Almost impossible to get in touch with the manufacturer. The door is hard to install and the directions don't cover all the bases. Forget about getting a hold of any further info if you get stuck.
3,Notice: The product does not match the above photo,"Before you make the same mistake that I made, note that this product is not the product in the photo above. The photo shows the entire pet door assembly (which is what I need). This product is only the rubber flaps, and excludes the frame that is pictured.I hope Amazon removes or updates the photo so that others will not have to deal with sending the product back because it doesn't match the photo."
1,Don't rely on reviews,"After reading the favorable reviews I decided to purchase this item. I am located in a very good location for receiving TV signals with just an indoor antenna, but this item failed miserably to bring in anything at all. Go figure."
1,Disappointed,The plastic screen was heavily scratched on the unit I received even though there was a factory applied protective sticker over it. I would not buy another of their products.
4,"Great picture, hungry for batteries","It probably depends on where you live, but I get AMAZING reception and a very clear picture with this unit. It does seem that it goes through batteries quickly, but I haven't actually timed it."
1,Disappointed,"I would love to review this Lions Gate DVD, but I can't catch one word in ten. It is NOT, as advertised, closed-captioned, and the characters' speech is too casual and British for me to get. Drat! -- I was so chuffed to see there was a cc version."
1,"In a story, something must happen","I am a great Samantha Morton fan, and so it was high expectations that I got my hands on this film. And I was absolutely astonished by how bad it is, notwithstanding all the awards it apparently has garnered. I don't think films should be filled with car chases and gun fights, but SOMETHING'S GOT TO HAPPEN. Minutes, tens of minutes, scores of minutes, go by in which Morton does little more than stare into space and smoke cigarettes. At the film's start fully a half hour goes by, and there is virtually no meaningful action unless you count a bunch of quick cuts of a dope party. In addition, the leads' accents are so thick as to be virtually unintelligible. But, in the end, who really cares? Finally, exasperated, I tried watching it at 2x, and then 4x, regular speed. And it was still slow. Skip it!"
1,GHASTLY,"I too was at the famed double feature. I loved Lilya 4-Ever and highly recommend it. What I can't recommend is this movie. It struck me as an amateur attempt at art. The concept had promise but the film ended up being horrible. I can assure all who read this that you don't need to be ""like Lana"" i.e. a red-headed bimbo who has the I.Q. of a peanut to dislike this movie. In fact you can be quite intelligent and educated and well versed in foreign films and hate this movie. In fact, coming from someone who has lived abroad and watched more foreign films than Hollywood blockbusters I can assure you this film sucks no matter what country you're in or what type of films you normally enjoy. -No missing brain parts... Not like Lana."
1,LOSER,"This is 93 minutes of your life wasted. Unless, of course, you're interested in a nobody who is going nowhere and doing nothing with her life. Much of the dialogue cannot even be understood. You can file it under ""art."" I'd put an ""f"" in front of it instead."
3,"Interesting, arty, even pushes the envelope a bit, but a bit too tedious.","While I could appreciate the story and the art direction and cinematography are at times entrancing, like a reviewer above declares, it sometimes didn't seem to know where to stop. I was still left feeling like, okay, but you need something else here. You didn't give me enough for sitting through this. I know that sometimes the viewers attitude, time of day, month, life can effect how a movie is perceived, maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but I think this movie is an interesting failure. The 3 stars are for having the courage to try something new, and the art, and I am being generous. It makes me wonder about the people who gave this movie awards, did they not have any choices or were they trying to second guess the other pretentious spin doctors?Peter Greenaway does this stuff much better, get one of his movies if you want art."
4,Morvern Callar is unusual.,"The story is unusual. Her name sounds strange to the American ear and the accents are nearly impossible to discern. The film style is captivating and the amazing soundtrack stands out as a perfect backdrop to the interesting tale of a woman who takes a big risk as she claims her independence. Her impulsiveness is unsettling yet you find yourself rooting for her all the way. Morvern's reaction to her boyfriends suicide looks like slow shock. You cannot ignore the creepiness of seeing her step over his lifeless body for as long as she does; yet, you find yourself peering at her to see if she's suffering; only to realize that if she is, she has a strange way of showing it. This is a great piece of film and I'd give it 5 stars if it had subtitles and ran a few chapters longer. I didn't like the feeling that it left me hanging at the end."
4,What gives with the sound?,"I enjoyed this movie and thought the DVD was okay, except for the sound. In parts of the film the sound is out of sync with the video so that it looks like it was dubbed. The scene in which Morvern meets the book publishers is a case in point. Whether it was just the copy of the DVD I bought or it is simply a bad mix, I don't know.Anyone else have this problem?"
2,mmmm...not so good.,"This movie is one long journey to absolute nothingness. Sometimes my favorite parts in movies are the quiet one's. Movies with great moments of silence are great if they're necessary. Unfourtunately, while i appreciated the quiet introspection, i could not tolerate a whole movie like that. I will say Morvern Callar has a great opening, one that makes you wonder. The rest though is just...boring. I appreciated nothing else, and found it empty. Nothing was gained or lost, or learned.I cant recommend this to any one, unless you have to see every movie ever made."
2,"poor sound, no subtitles",I could not understand the dialogue on the dvd. It was mixed too low and the British slang and accent made it impossible to understand. This is a perfect example of a movie that requires subtitles for an American audience (which were not included on the dvd I viewed). Visually the movie was good and interesting and overall the movie could have been good but the soundtrack was annoying (including the choice of music).
2,"Sucked, really. SPOILERS BELOW, but who cares?","I would not recommend the purchase of this movie. Why would you let a dead loved one's body lay on the floor for days and just step over it? They never showed Morvern doing any drugs, but I'm sure she had to be on something the way she acted. What normal person chops their lover up and buries them without contacting anyone who might have wanted to know that he was dead.Was i the only one waiting for Morvern and her ""friend"" to have sex?I regret buying this movie."
3,"Intriguing, polarizing film","There's a lot to like about this film.... it has amazing sound design (maybe the best I've come across since _Requiem for a Dream_) and is terrifically visually inventive (color and framing choices are occasionally flamboyant but more often they are just enough askew so you are always seeing things afresh). Lynne Ramsay is evidently a director to watch, and is cut from the same cloth as Lynch and Aronofsky. But, and its going to be a big ""but"" for a lot of people, the story drifts along and is in some sense *about* drift and ennui. If that doesn't sound like your sort of thing then this movie probably won't be. But if you are interested in the technical aspects of film-making or enjoy the slightly somnabulent state one sometimes enters at art galleries and museums then _Morvern Callar_ is definitely worth seeing."
1,Don't be fooled...,"This is pretentious nonsense at its worst -- cinema for the stoned or for those with incredibly short attention spans. The director does not appear to be able to commit to any particular scene or mood. There are scores of scenes where Ms. Morton appears to have been directed to just ""do anything while I pan the camera over you."" The one potentially interesting development of the plot, Morvern's sale of her dead boyfriend's novel manuscript, ends up leading nowhere. There are brilliant, unconventional films where the visual fabric dominates the conventional storylines, and then there are films like this that get by on being so jarring and pretentious that viewers are afraid to say it sucks."
2,Credit for acting but not for much else,"The cast is quite good in this film, and perhaps some of the music, but the rest of it is unfocused, plodding, and trying to look artsy and mesmerizing by having no sound at all in the early scenes and then showing the main character examining twigs or windows or other things, as if it were meaningful to do so.It's also impossible to be interested in the protagonist, who disposes of her suicidal boyfriend's body after leaving it in their flat for a while so she can go out and party for the sake of distraction. Then she replaces his name on his novel with hers, gets it accepted and gets the money and credit that should have gone to him.Later, she drags her best friend out of a hotel in Spain, gets them lost in the wilderness and then abandons her pal.Sheesh!"
4,Tried and true!...,"I am an auditing student and we are currently using this text as the base for our class..and it is a good tool for the beginning audit student. It covers the basics of auditing, from the logic of auditing to audit conclusions, and does so in a fairly easy to understand manner. As it happens, one of the authors is also my auditing professor. That being the case, I can tell you first-hand that the book is exemplary of the authors' expertise and knowledge in the area of auditing...This text is a must for those just learning about the field..."
5,Should b great!,"Klonoa is a really good game.....for those who have no idea what it is about,read carefully. In the game, Klonoa is transported to a world that is devoid of dreams. Klonoa must defeat four mystical monsters to give back the ability to dream to the people of this world. Adventures of Klonoa will take him through a world where dreams are forbidden.This world includes four major towns, and Klonoa must vanquish four mystical monsters and restore the ability to dream to the sleep-deprived people of the world. The side-scrolling gameplay is a mix of action and puzzle elements--some levels are more action-oriented, while others require players to solve a wide array of puzzles. There will be a total of more than 40 levels in the game. Naturally, Klonoa's general moves, which are intrinsic to the series, will be available in Klonoa for the GBA.The graphics should be good also,and overall the game should be a huge hit!"
5,2nd best gba game,"Right under the 2nd Klonoa game for the GBA.Go watch the CGR review of this game.Surprise, you aren't Sonic.It's a puzzler mixed with a plat former.This is much more focused on the puzzles than the console games, which you may think is a turn off, but the puzzles are so well thought out near the mid-end of the game.There is one major problem with this game, which the 2nd game also has. The music is bad. The music in the cut-scenes is great, and Klonoa games typically have great music, but the gba games are the exceptions. It actually detracts more form the game then you might expect.Still the core gameplay is so solid, that it makes up for the music.I'd just go ahead and watch the CGR review, it'll tell you all you need to know.Great game, go buy it."
2,Good Bag but make sure you zip it up!,I purchased this bag for my Pentax K10D and accessories. The camera fit nicely in the bottom compartment with my old Pentax telephoto zoom in a padded sleeve in the top. It looks nice and was great for a touring/hiking trip in Costa Rica. That was until I forgot to zip the camera in the bottom pouch before standing up. Yep - totally trashed. I was not in the habit of snapping outside latch of the flap closed. The flap covers the zipper for the camera area. It was easy to not notice the camera area was not zipped. I recommend the bag but make sure to zip in after every use and snap the flap strap just to be on the safe side. Good Luck!
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"No benefits that were noticed and, if taken on an empty stomach, will make you nauseaus.It may work for some but I feel I wasted my money."
4,I Love This Series!!!!,"This is a great series published by Brava and so far none of them have let me down.This is the first in which my favorite Ms. Foster does not have a short story included. Despite this this book is well worth reading. I'm not going to go into great detail on the sysnopsis of each story since that has already been done and done well at that. In any event Ms. McKenna's (who is on my automatic buying list) short story was my favorite and I can only hope has plans with will include the rest of Mac's family (hint, hint...) sooner rather than later. With that said I must go on record that none of the stories in this anthology are weak. All of them are real strong, with great characters (yummy alpha male heros, not taking any sass heroines!) and fun storylines. And they are all three steamy in their own right. For a fast but fun read you can't go wrong with any of the ""Bad Boy"" series!!!"
5,Absolutely Amazing!!!,"As a reader of all the ""Bad Boy"" titles, this one was by far the best. I especially enjoyed Shannon Mckenna's story, ""Meltdown"". This story was unbelievably erotic and I hope there will be a story about both secondary characters also.Donna Kauffman's, ""Exposed"" was equally intriguing, centered around two strangers who meet on a train in a snowstorm.. all I can say is ""Wow"". This was one trilogy I could not put down.. I read it in just a few hours."
4,WOW!!!,"Just finished this book. I have to say, the first one, Meltdown, was really fabulous. I read it one sitting. The heroine, Jane is hilarious and wonderful. And the sex scenes really sizzled.The other two stories were okay too, but I definitely think the first one was the absolute best!"
1,Do not buy this book,"This book does NOT ""Features Actual Business Plans of Pizza Hut, Ben & Jerry's and others"" - It contains tiny excerpts from the above listed plans, that are so small they are not really helpful. There is not a single full business plan sample in this entire book. A full sample business plan is included in almost every other business plan book I have read. This book is a real simplistic business plan book for college students studying the process, not a tool for actual business people."
5,Marvelous Russians,"Excellent recording with fine Chandos sound. Neemi Jarvi is in top form, the playing is polished as should be expected from this wonderful orchestra playing under a confident conductor that clearly understands the culture of the music. Highly recommended!"
5,"One of the greatest Russian, Romantic orchestral works...",and certainly one of Neeme Jarvi's greatest recorded performances Spellbinding and riveting. IMO both musically and sonically one of the best CDs ever poduced. If you are a lover of Russian orchestral music this is a must-have.
4,Very good... Only missing one song...,"The album is a very good sampling of XTMP's work. It includes the harsher, more EBM oriented early work, and the newer, more electropop influenced work. However, my sole complaint with the disc stems from the non inclusion of ""Ebb Tide Flow"", a excellent track off of the ""Drawback"" album. Otherwise, a fine summerization of XTMP's career."
3,Great to connect the ipod but mine does not charge the ipod,"I was pleased with the cable as when I bought my pioneer receiver and my ipod I did not knwo this cable existed. I was excited to find out about it and had it installed right away. I was thrilled until the ipod stopped working, and then I found out that in my set up the receiver does not charge the ipod. When I connect the ipod the ipod screen says ""charging is not available with this accesory"" this was really bad news for me as now I need an extra cable to charge it or I have to take it out and charge it separetedly which was not the idea. So, make sure the charging option is available with your receiver. My receiver is a pioneer DEH-P5950IB."
2,Charge your iPod/iPhone? Maybe not.,"I bought this with the Pioneer DEH-P3000IB in-dash receiver, and it does *not* charge iPods or iPhones, despite the claim in the tech specs. A different head unit might support that, but this description should really be changed to indicate that it works only in some cases. The product does what it's designed to do, but two stars for misleading presentation; without charging it's no more useful than using the aux input -- actually less, because it also locks out the device controls when attached."
2,Pioneer Chord,This chord finally gave out on me about 2 months ago. I've heard many guys who have had the same problem. It won't recognize the iphod or iphone anymore so be warned...
3,Cord Does not charge,"I have the old pioneer D3 touch screen navi and DVD player. The cord works as far as sound and video BUT it does NOT charge my ipod. I tried my ipod touch, the nano, and my iphone and they all say chargin not supported. SO BE AWARE that this cord will not charge ur device. Kind of sucks because i would have just gone with the aux cable If i had known this. Wasted my money... OH WELL! Good luckMy original post was removed from amazon. I had to repost to make sure people were aware of product defect, GOOD JOB protecting ur customers amazon..."
1,Not for the item amazon has it paired with!!,Does not charge Ipod at all!! Does not go with the Pioneer 5100DVD that Amazon has it paired with. Be careful!
1,Avoid at all costs!!,"Heads up for anyone that is thinking about buying a Pioneer product. I bought the Pioneer AVH-P4000 DVD player for my car and it was the worst thing I could have ever done in my life. This player will NOT work with most IPODS!!! And the ones it does work with, well lets just say NEVER update the IPOD's software. Once you do this, all bets are off. The IPOD will be as useless to you as can be. There's no way to revert back to the old software and Pioneer, in their unyielding wisdom, has decided not to offer firmware updates for their products, or at least the one I got anyways. As you can see where this goes, an updated IPOD can't be recognized by the radio anymore and hence your out of luck. Something tells me we should all file a class action lawsuit against Pioneer for not advising us of this dirty little ploy of theirs. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"
2,Not worth the price.,"This is basically a $14.00 aux cable. It does nothing more than what you will get from a simple aux port and a speaker cable. DEH-3000IB is what we are using this for and although you can control music playback via the ipod or iphone, it does not charge the devices at all. Not recommended for anyone."
4,Excellent investment,This was a great purchase. The cable arrived in 2-3 days and works great. High quality sound for a great price. Only thing is is that the connection to the iPOD sometimes goes out and it must be unplugged and reinserted. A great buy.
1,DIDN'T MEET EXPECTATIONS!!,The product doesn't work the way I expected it to. When I use it sound only comes out of the drivers side speakers. Also it doesn't charge the IPOD.
2,Might not charge newer Ipods!!!,"I did not buy this from Amazon, but had it installed with my Pioneer AVIC-D3 in 2007. At the time I had a 4gb nano and this cord was great...it allowed me to operate the Ipod on my touchscreen AND IT CHARGED IT...so I never had to take the Ipod out of my car except to sync it. About a year or so ago I bought a 16gb nano and THIS CORD WILL NOT CHARGE IT. When you plug it in it displays on the Ipod screen ""CHARGING IS NOT SUPPORTED WITH THIS ACCESSORY"". It will play but you will have to remove it every day or two and charge it (depending on use). I gave it two stars because it is a good cord if you don't mind taking it out to charge it every day or so...or if you plan to use it with a 4gb nano. Please understand, I only have plugged these two nanos, and an Iphone (also played but DID NOT CHARGE) into my system...I can't confirm or deny charging capabilities with any other Apple products."
1,DOESNT CHARGE IPOD,"I bought this ipod cable thinking it'll charge ipod touch. It works fine but it doesn't charge it. This doesn't help me out, I drive trucks for a living and my ipod touch always dies on me on my long roadtrips. The description for this item should be changed since it doesn't charge most of the new generation ipods and ipod touch."
2,This thing is worthless,"I purchased the CD-i200 to interface my ipod CLASSIC to the AVIC-N4 HU in my car. After I installed it and plugged in my ipod I got an error message on screen. Not being able to find the error code given in either owners manual, I called Pioneer customer (non)support. I was told the code meant that particular ipod was incompatible with the N4. I then asked which ipods do work with this interface? I was told MOST GEN 3 & 4 ipods will work. When I asked if he could be a little more specific, he got testy with me and hung up. I have since been able to learn that the N4 is also incompatible with the ipod touch. Which ipods will work with this item. I don't know. So if you have an N4 and an ipod, you better make sure that your ipod will work BEFORE you purchase this item. In my opinion it's worthless without that information. If you don't know, don't expect any help form Pioneer."
3,Started off nice!,"Worked great when I first bought it! But I updated the software on my IPod and POW!!!! No more video to the head unit(Pioneer Avic-D3)! Not the cable's fault, but it's still 50% useless to me now. Works great if all you want to control is music!"
3,Pioneer iPod Direct Cable,"No video playback with newer iPod models (nanos, iPod touch, iPhone). Audio interface works fine."
3,Pioneer CDI200 cable,"not sure how many stars to give right now. something caused the pioneer unit to freeze up after installing this cable. I disconnected he cable, and the unit is working ok again."
3,iPod cord,"I like being able to operate my iPod through my radio....the only downfall is unlike other cables that plug into the bottom , this one doesnt provide a charge for the iPod. So , if your going on a long trip, bring your car charger for your iPod."
1,i wish i could give it no stars,i bought this product and i was excited my friend has one like it... well i hook it up.... it doesnt charge the ipod this is useless it sounds awesome and works amazing but its a waste of money. but one that charges!
1,Do Not Even Bother To Call For Free Book,"Avoid this book and his free offer. The call-in center is absolutely bogus. I kept being told - ""hold on a minute"" and ""can you repeat that"" - Not surprised after reading all the other comments. What a sham and what a shame!"
1,Don't waste your money,"First of all, this book is (or was) available for free through ads on various financial web sites. However, once Parness and/or the Trendfund people get your personal information, they will hound you with high-pressure phone calls attempting to get you to commit to becoming ""a partner"". The shtick is similar to tactics used by penny stock mongers and various scamsters who rely on the phone and finely crafted scripts to manipulate others into sending them money.Michael Parness does have a compelling story. However, you have to ask yourself: If this guy is really that good at ""power trading"", why does he and/or his associates need to use high-pressure sales tactics to generate income from others?"
1,Book is useless,"Do not buy this book. Please. It is poorly thought out, poorly structured, way over priced, not proof read... just an attempt to rush a piece of trash into the market and pick people's pockets.Another poster stated that you should read Dr Alexander Elder, and several others. She is right. Great books, deep insight, worth 2X their prices, especially the Elder books. This book is not worth the paper it's printed on."
2,"Not much substance, unfortunately paid 69.00$","There really is not anything of substance in this book, just like the first. I read his first book and it was very generic in what was included.....this is much like that execept with some examples, not unlike you can see on any other traders website where they generally just show the good stuff(aka tokyo joe)...anyway you are better off just waiting till it comes down to 10$ on ebay if you really want to read it."
1,Nothing new...,"Having learned to ""trade"" through years of reading, study and experience, I later went to one of his free seminars. Nothing new for me and as I was leaving I actually saw Mr. Parness outside the conference room asking his staff how was the sells pitch going. I introduced myself and wanted to ask a few questions but was treated rather rudely.What stuck me was that this man needed to stoop to carnival like strategies. I had already (as a newbie) caught on to the email alerts which would run up a stock while the author took profits... There are many ways to scam the public.Go to any library - read up and start small."
3,Nothing here of any value at all,"I have edited my posting and can't give this book 1 star like I'd like to. I read Rule the Freakin' Markets (OK) and Tiny's Charting book (not good) but this book absolutely sucks, hands down, a piece of stink. They mailed it to me for free, and it still sucks. As a former TrendFund subscriber (foolishly pre-paid for all of 2005 so could get the exalted January Defects list - followed it to the letter, lost $50,000! Great insight Waxie!!! Dude, you so totally suckkkk!!!) I can say with absolute certainty that there is nothing even slightly valuable coming from this bunch of scummy, arrogant rip off artists. People posting positive reviews should be ashamed of themselves..."
5,Mystic Iran: The Unseen World,"First it came as a revelation to me and to many Iranians and foreigners that women dervishes even exist in Iran. For me this film apart from its beautiful cinematography and exquisite portrayal of Persian landscape, architecture, history, people and religions, came as close as is humanly possible to portraying an altered state of consciousness on film. I think this documentary is as close as a spectator can get to having a religious experience. The soft purring voice narration of Shohreh Aghdashloo as a caravan of jewels passes by your sences and the obvious compassion in the hearts of the dervishes of Kurdestan combine to make this film truely unique and in a spiritual dimension. I highly recommend this to anyone yearning for the path of the Sufi..."
5,MOVING!,"An extraodinary film about mystical practices in Iran. Shoreh Aghadashloo has written and narrated this documentary with great sensitivity and explores practices rarely if ever seen on film before. A must for people interested in mysticism, and a moving a triumphant film."
3,Interesting,"Those involved clearly put in an effort which should be praised. However, many other beautiful and traditionally significant issues should have been included such as the typical beautiful persian marriage ceremony and the symbolic items involved. I hope they do a follow-up DVD on ""Mystical traditions in Iran"" such as the traditional New Year and the symbolism involved, a typical marriage ceremony and other traditions such as Chahar Sambe Souri."
1,God and Allah are not the same.,"I was just watching the short film ""Mystic Iran."" ...If anyone thinks the word God that Aryana Farshad uses thoughout this film is similar, parallel or the same to Allah, you'd be wrong--she is.In this film, a woman goes into a trance and she quenches a burning piece of wood with her mouth among other things, God would never make you do things to mutilate, harm, nor cut your body.Ms. Farshad should have used ""Allah"" throughout the film to describe all these rituals and creed practiced by these Sufis (Darvishes). So glad my God is real and is not in a tomb, nor induces us to eat fire and walk in it (big sigh)."
4,"A dense, enjoyable foray into nouveaux murder mysteries...","James Lee Burke writes in a quirky, but likeable prose. Often, it isn't quite clear just what he is getting at because of his continual use of metaphor. After the reader gets used to it, however, the writing takes on a charming -feeling-, and the style is familiar and expected.He paints vivid, full-sensual portraits of scenery and characters, going as far as to describe scents and lighting highlights, the fog and atmosphere, the sweat in peoples' hair, et cetera.The mystery isn't over-complex, but isn't quite simple, either. This book (like Burke's others) are not just about the murder mystery, theyre a story told about characters. And you want to keep reading, even after the book is over, to ""keep in touch"" with the cahracters he has created and richly portrayed.Burke is one of the better mystery authors writing today. This is a great book, but certainly none of his should be missed."
4,An Early James Lee Burke,James Lee Burke writes novels that are very atmospheric and rich in dialogue and characters. This is one of the early Dave Robicheaux crime novels. A movie ( financed by the mob) is being made around New Iberia. At the same time Dave is investigating a serial killer and the murder of a black man (over 30 years old). He is also having encounters with the spirit of a conferate general. Dave is investigating the serial killings with a female FBI agent who has her own demons.Somehow everything comes together at the end. This is a dark tale . James Lee Burke makes Louisanna a very interesting place.
3,Well-Written But Typical Robicheaux Mystery,"If you're new to the Dave Robicheaux series, this book or the first one in the series (Black Cherry Blues) is a good place to start. Pluses: Excellent writing--smooth flowing, some memorable lines, realistic dialogue. A troubled, introspective protagonist, reminisicent of John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee. A fast-moving plot. Change-of-pace fantasy conversations with Civil War figures, brought on by a drink laced with LSD by the bad guy. Minuses: Burke's bad guys are always one-dimensional, sociopathic, no complexity of character. The new skeleton in Robicheaux's closet is one too many; too many bad things have happened to him; not believable. Readers of other books in the series will be familiar with the scene where Robicheaux goes over the edge and gets too violent and the scene where he's on the receiving end. Worth a try if you like good writing and don't mind plot devices similar to other Robicheaux novels."

3,Will definitely continue this series!,"I don't have the first five books in this series, so I started with this one. I have to say, I was hooked. I enjoyed Burke's insights into and references to Dave's past. Dave's new partner, Rosie Gomez, was standup, and Dave's 'visions' and continuing dialogue with a dead confederate soldier is what really held my attention. This is a definite must read, and I hope the other books in this series are as good."
4,he write with all five senses.......,"If you are unfamiliar with this author, this book would be an interesting introduction to the Dave Robicheaux novels by Burke. Burke writes with all five senses in mind. The descriptions of the Southern Louisiana will make you thirst for a sweet tea. The plot revolves around a possible serial murderer of young girls. It also involves the mafia infiltrating his locale through a Hollywood movie making event. The two may be connected. When Dave Robicheaux begins to see Confederate soldiers, and has conversations with them, you wonder, was it Dave Robicheaux' car accident, was it alcohol, or has Mr. Burke opted for a science fantasy turn of events. (No, it is not the latter!) This was an extremely well done novel, not his best of the Dave Robicheaux novels, but still very good. If you haven't read other of James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux novels, anytime is a good time to start. If you enjoy Southern Detective/Police mysteries, these will not dissapoint you."
5,chasing the dragon,"I couldn't put this book down. Joseph Prince recommended this book and I ordered it online right away. It was inspiring and very practical in teaching someone about the gifts of the Holy Spirit, something that is not readily discussed today. I loved the book and my family and friends are waiting for me to pass it on! I definitely recommend it."
3,It does the job ...,but don't expect it to be comfortable for very long. Also very difficult to get the legs separated. The first couple of times it took 2 people to get it open!
2,So small--this must be built for skinny men!,"The seat is surprisingly narrow. I'm a slender woman, and my hips are bigger than the seat. I'd order something else if I could be sure it would be wider, but that doesn't seem to be in the specs.I wrote this review before and it never appeared. But now Amazon wants my feedback, so maybe they'll publish it."
1,Bitterness & hatred.,"While Burton Hersh's work does contain some interesting facts, as a history it is little more than the author's opinions. Because of his constant vitriolic assault on the character of the people he writes about, the read is tedious at best. This book reveals more about Mr. Hersh's bitterness and hatred toward the early American intelligence community than it does about the history of the CIA. No joy."
1,The Old Boys,"The trouble with Burton Hersh is that he never bothered to read what he wrote. If he had he'd have realized that it is uncomprehensible. This is partly due to the fact that he is a functional illiterate. He doesn't have a basic understanding of what a sentence is.He also has a very poor choice of words. He uses words that he obviously does not know what they mean.Secondly I am old enough to know that most of his ""information"" is sheer hogwash. It's either badly distorted or false. It's a figment of his imagination. I am 76 and fought in World War II and knew some of those he writes about. They are mostly bland liveless bureaucrats. Not the bizarre creatures he depicts. I have suffered through 83 pages and can sight any number of lies and distortions."
5,fabulous,This is the perfect book to read if you'll be teaching anything in the nutritional area. Ms. Nestor writes articleately about an often confusing subject
5,Great gift,I bought this cd for my dad for a Christmas gift. He loves it. Says it brings back great memories.
1,Not Good!,"I have had this portable tv for less than (and I mean less than) 30 days.. During the 1st few days, it worked fine. Unfortunately now, the tv no longer works for some unknown reason. It's not the batteries, because I am using an adapter that is fitted for this tv. Therefore, I am sending this tv back and I would not recommend."
4,Axion TV,"This is a great little tv. The picture is so clear, I can read the scroll on the news. The downside is that it really sucks up the battery juice. Oh yeah, it will be obsolete in one year, once HD goes into effect."
5,Great Shows,"My 5 and 6 year old kids love these episodes. We saw them on netflix and have to have these. They remind me of Scooby doo episodes, since its the same maker."
3,So so,"I bought this video to supplement materials for a class I teach. Some of the information in it was good , but some was not so accurate. I showed it with a ""disqualifier"" to my class to take the information that seemed to enhance the other class information that was presented."
2,not a perfect perfect reproduction,"This book is essentially a photocopy of a book originally published in 1893 (you can download it off google books, since the copyright has expired). What disappointed me the most was that in the glossary section, the root symbol is missing for some verbal roots, making the verbal root appear to be part of the previously defined word, making look up said verbal roots much harder. I have seen other version of this reader, and the root symbol is present in them."
1,A disappointment,"I ordered this book because I needed it for a class, however I was disappointed with the quality of product I received. This ""reprint"" by Forgotten Books is simply a poor quality photocopy of a library book (it even has the photocopy of the card with the library return dates at the back) old enough to be out of copyright bound up & sold off for a quick buck. The pages with the actually Sanskrit on them often have blank spots in the lines - missing letters or whole words - on some of the pages the lines are cut off by the margins & a number of them are missing the final three or four lines of the page because the photocopy was bigger than the size page in the book. The only reason I'm able to use it for class at all is because I borrowed my teacher's proper copy & filled in the missing content by hand."
2,Disappointing,"I can't remember how I was convinced to buy this CD, perusing the Amazon site, but it was definitely oversold and I wish I'd thought twice. Ms. Yeshaya clearly has talent and a beautiful voice, but this album is very uneven in ways I'm not sophisticated enough to describe, but I do know something about music. She needs refinement, to settle into her own unique style so that one will understand what one is going to here. Obviously she's much loved for all the hype, but money is money. This was too much to spend when I could have bought someone tried and true.Sorry."
5,A splendid debut,"This new CD release was dubbed ""a splendid debut"" by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Don't miss it. Start with ""A Night in Tunisia,"" and you won't want to stop."
3,"just OK, perhaps over-priced","This table-top tripod is just OK and of average manufacture. It comes with a carry sack. The head is fine, but there may be trouble down the road where the legs attach to the head as they're merely pinned into plastic.Please note that the legs on this tripod have only three positions: fully retracted; one extension; or fully extended. You won't be able to use this tripod, say for a spotting scope, as you'll be unable to adjust the head height for ease of use unless you resort to shimming with other objects underneath the tripod's feet."
1,TPS and JIT repackaged as DFT,"Demand Flow Technology is nothing new. It is John Costanza's attempt to repackage what he saw in Japan 15 years ago ... the Toyota Production System, just in an Americanized version. Standardized work, Takt time, line balancing, and Kanban. In addition, driving to demand, which Toyota has mastered. Don't waste your time on this poorly written book."
1,A waste of time,"This poorly written book reads more like a very lengthy brochure for Constanza's seminars. There is not enough information in the book to make it truly useful. Readers interested in Japanese manufacturing methods had best go elsewhere. In general, ""lean methods"" don't work in the US simply because of cultural differences which are very important to sustaining/implementing ""lean"" and because American companies often use ""lean manufacturing"" as a euphemism for ""downsizing"". Companies and indivduals interested in making a significant improvement in profitabilty of their companies would be better off avoiding this book and others like it and concentrating on implementing TRIZ and applying the ideas in books like ""Double your profits in 6 months or less"" by Bob Fifer."
5,Get thee to a nunnery!,"China has survived the Christmas rush at her herb shop but is sadly in need of some private time. So off she goes to a nunnery! Together with her friend Maggie, she heads off to a remote nunnery where the sisters grow amazing garlic. Instead of the peace and quiet she longs for, China finds herself embroiled in a contentious power struggle between two groups of nuns working to combine two disparate orders into one. As the sister's jockey for position, fires break out and several mysterious deaths occur. If that wasn't enough, China runs into an old beau and the heat is still there. As she works to solve the nunnery mystery she is making major life choices for herself. Once again, I enjoyed the ride and learned more about herbs and gardening."
3,Not Her Best,"Susan Albert writes great mystery books but this one is not up to her usual high standards. Her sleuth, China Bayles, has been uprooted from Pecan Springs and transplanted in an abbey (she's on vacation). Nuns are not as amusing as witches (read Witches Bane!) and they are not as colorful as the inhabitants of Pecan Springs (I sure missed Ruby!). This is her worst book so far, but it is still pretty good, just not as good as her others."
3,"I agree, Not Her Best","I was so excited to find this series, and I've enjoyed all the books so far. I enjoyed this one too, but it was not her best. I really missed Ruby. We only see her at the beginning, and there were no real harmless eccentrics in this one, and I think that is what Ms. Albert does so well. Also, the mysteries were a little simple compared to her other plots. I will continue to read the series because I love China Bayles so much. I'm also curious to see what she does with her life after she has reflected in the nunnery."
3,You're luck if you get even 1 EX card,"I assumed I was purchasing a pack of strictly EX cards.The cards inside the pack are all standard Pokemon cards, and you may get a single foil / EX card if you're lucky. Not worth the cost as you can get them for half the price in Target."
3,It's a knockoff of Bomberman,"Hey! Somebody replaced the mad bombers in my Bomberman game with Muppets! Actually the game in question (and beileve me, it will raise a few) is Planet Monsters, a multiplayer maze game that happens to look and play a lot like Bomberman. Instesd of dropping bombs, players kick the blocks that comprise the games mazes at one another. To spice things up, the developers also tossed in power-ups, boss characters, and non-player mutants that kill you with just a touch (not fair is it?). Nonetheless, the game reamins a simple Bomberman knockoff which would be fine if the GBA didn't already have a Bomberman game."
5,I can't wait for the movie,"I truly enjoyed this book after borrowing it from the library. After that I searched, and searched for my own copy. I've shared it with friends and family and they've all enjoyed this rollercoaster ride inside the movie-making industry. For everyone who wanted to know about how the industry works, or what does a producer do exactly, or how important is the screenwriter, or a true behind-the-scenes glimpse, this is a must read. Plus, the story itself is a mystery, a love story, and a triumph of the little man. It's a must read! I'm waiting for the movie adaptation, myself!"
5,Doctors read this book too,"I can grab this thing and find out what I need to know in a big hurry. It has all the essentials. The 2001 edition continues the fine tradition of its predecessors, with meds grouped by function, an index that covers both generic and brand names, and drug descritions that tell you what you really want to know right now for treating someone. How good is this book? With the PDR available to me for free, I am paying money to get this one."
5,A GREAT BUY,These three movies are some of my Christmas favorites. I was very happy to be able to find all 3 of them in a package deal. Already watched them twice this season.
5,I like these,They look alot better with a cleaner picture and better sound. Anne Margret never looked better. Seeit again for the first time.
5,Good christmas movie!,My wife loves this movie set. We have made this series of movies a tradition to watch in my house!
2,good movies not blu ray quality,"I was more than excited when this arrived until I popped it into my blu ray player an instantly noticed it is not HD quality. Looks like they took the movies from their original format rather than upgrading the picture quality. Still a good bunch of movies, just not up to par."
3,Not as good as the first one,I was hoping for a continuation on the first two but it seemed to be a different story. Sometimes a 1&2 are enough for a movie.
5,the santa clause: 3 movie collection,it didn't take very long to receive the movies after I ordered it. We watched all 3 movies on Christmas eve and was great watching them with kids and grand kids. very enjoyable. Thank you.
5,The Santa Claus Collection,The Santa Claus Collection is a classic trilogy which my family and I will watch for years to come. I'm glad that I purchased the collection so that we can view them in sequence. I highly recommend adding this to your dvd library!
1,The worst purchase I ever made.,"I can't believe it, I NEVER received an E-mail informing me that You declined my order, I NEVER received the item I asked for or any apologie. If YOU guys don't want to sell this item to me, It's OK, there are some other sellers. So I ASK YOU: WHY DO YOU CHARGED THIS TRANSACTION ON MY CREDIT CARD for an Item I NEVER received. I WANT MY MONEY BACK if you don't mind."
4,Classic Tim Allen,Price worked out to $9 a movie which is a great deal for these seasonal favorites in Blu-ray. A fun watch.
5,"Very fast delivery, exellent quality picture!!!",From start to finish the process was easy! I and my little boy could'nt be happier! The price for bluray was only 3 bucks more than the standard digital copy.
3,Beware Santa Clause 3 not Region Free,"Enjoyed watching these for Christmas, but found Santa Clause 3 is Locked to Region A, despite disc artwork saying ""ABC"". Clause 1 and 2 are OK. I had to use my MultiRegion Kogan Player to view. We are lucky in Australia as our laws demand we can get Region Free players, if we want.Happy New Movie year!"
5,The Santa Clause 3-Movie Collection,"The movies are classic and now in blu ray, they are even that much better. The sound in HD is wonderful. It's like watching the movies over again for the first time. Great Holiday Collection at at fantstic price. Enjoy!!"
5,Love the videos!,I'm a fan of these movies. I received them for Christmas and one of them was scratched due to packaging. It was so easy to exchange the package and get a replacement. Love the videos.
3,Poor video format,Poor video format. Does not make use of widescreen tv. No other choices were available. There is no excuse for selling this format at a time when nearly everyone who purchases dvd's has a widescreen tv.
4,nice,This gift set is in great condition and came in a timely mannor. All videos were accounted for. Thank you!
1,Poor Listings,The Santa Clause 3-movie collection was misleading in your ads. Nowhere did it state that the films would be full screen. It is essential that all products be correctly advertized. I was very disappointed.
1,Not good enough!,"Wow, wish they had made this WIDESCREEN, then I would have bought it. If they ever do, I might by it as I don't have any of these on DVD yet! Until then I guess I will just have to figure on buying the individually when I finally get around to it."
1,Full screen,"Why can't Amazon more clearly indicate which DVD's are in Full Screen (i.e. pan-and-scan) - I had searched for ""The Santa Clause widescreen"" and this was the 3rd product from the top of the list, so I just bought it. The old 4:3 format TV's are nearly impossible to find on their site, why would they assume that people want to buy movies in 4:3? With many movies, they indicate widescreen or fullscreen in the product title, making it easy to see at a glance which is which.It's not even clearly indicated on the box itself - the only place it was indicated was on the spine of one of the 3 movies, but that label was obscured by a sticker!The recipient of the movies opened one of the DVD's and played it before I even realized that they were full screen, otherwise I'd return the set.I rarely give 1 star reviews, but I'm very dissapointed in this purchase. I realize that many people enjoy and even prefer full-screen movies, but I'm not one of them."
5,Favorite Movies!,"These are my 3 favorite movies, and its nice that the box holds all 3 dvd's (it's easy to know where they all are)."
1,Deceptive Marketing pushing old format videos,"There is no indication on the outside of the box or description of the video format. I bought this in a big box store before I read the reviews here. If I had known these were full screen instead of widescreen versions, I would not have purchased it."
4,Great Deal for customers who likes tim allen christmas movies,Im impressed with service it came on time and watched all three movies. Its a great deal with all three in it except it doesnt have english subtitles for deaf people if they lucky the close caption works on their tv than it works out.
3,Version,Does this version come in widescreen now? Previous reviews mentioned that it came in the full screen version and I would like to know before I purchase. The details mentioned that it is in widescreen so I'm not sure if this is a typo.
5,*GREAT MOVIES FOR EVERYONE TO ENJOY!*,"These are really enjoyable holiday movies for everyone.A great way to put you in the holiday spirit.In my opinion,the first one is the best.I like to watch them around the holidays.A great set to give as a gift for anyone who loves Christmas movies!"
4,The Santa Clause set,"My family and I love these movies. Tim Allen is great in them. We also are big fans of Bernard, the head elf. I would definitely recommend the set."
1,would not buy again.,Did not like this item one bit. Would not reset. Eventually fell off the bike and I do not miss it.
4,Great Gift,"This is a great gag gift for those big birthdays, like ""50"", just in case someone is ""losing their marbles""!"
2,I work as an ariel rigger on movies,"It is a great and comfortable hammer. Everyone envies it. But can you trust it when you work above people on a sound stage? The fear was so great, as well as doubts, that I had to stop using it. My friend wanted to buy it so I sold it to him. the next day I wanted it back, why would I sell it to him when we do the same thing for a living? STUPID! he decided to use it for camping, camping? At least there is no danger there. The other reviews got me very worried, and maybe I should, so I am glad they are there. Also, although it is a life time warranty, it cost 25 dollars for each replacement. I say BS. If it breaks, they should pay. I bought the dalluge, with side pull. I bought it here.. also a great hammer."
2,Its no longer the same hammer!,"This is not the same hammer for which all these other reviews were written! The head is steel and the handle is wood wrapped with a layer of fiberglass, with what I guess are a couple of strips of titanium.(thus the reason titanium is used in the description) This is reflected in the price, you note it is no longer $200 plus! I received mine and sent it back due to its bad condition. I will purchase another, but please understand I am a collector, from what I saw, would not own one for real use! The date this review was updated was 12-05-2010"
1,Rip Off,"As a framing contactor I received my hammer in Mid-October with greatenthusiasm.I've received many rave reviews on the appearance and feelof the hammer.Swinging it is a pleasure,it is light and delivers a terrificblow to the nail.I thought I had finally found a hammer durable enough tolast for years.However much to my dissappointment after only 6 weeks of use while pulling a nail out of a sheet of plywood the shaft snapped in half.The handle is only 1/8"" thick and filled with foam.Looks can be deceivingand are in this case.With it's current design this hammer is more suitablefor the Homeowner or Hanging on a wall because of it's unique design.Us professionals are willing to pay the price to own the best.DeadOnshould go back to the drawing board and provide a hammer with a solidunbreakable handle and they will have the best hammer on the MarketIf DeadOn wants to provide a hammer that lists for $299 than provideone that is worth the investment."
1,Worst hammer ever,"This hammer is the biggest waste of $300 aside from lighting your cash on fire. I bought this hammer when they first came out. We (our crew bought 4 of them $1200 worth of garbage) All four broke in the first week. The owner of Pullr Holdings company which owns dead on tools contacted me and sent me 4 new ones.. Well done sir. However the new design is still flawed. Broke the second geneartion hammers as well. Spoke to Pullr tools and they wont do anything until i send the hammer back to their offices so they can determine the problem. Mean while I can go spend another $100 on a stiletto and wait for my third ti7 to arrive so i can throw it in the trash.. Do yourself a favor and purchase stilettos product. way cheaper, less headaches, and in the end it'll be there for you when your ti7 is being repaired. garbage."
4,framers dream,"Great hammer,excellent balance, great blow force. Overhead work is no longer a killer. Not the best hammer for pulling nails and the claw could be a little sharper.Call me old fashion but I still like the straight handle,"
3,Useful for Freemasons,"If you're a Freemason, you may find this book useful as a guide. If not a Freemason, most likely you'll find this book nothing more than gibberish, which is what it's SUPPOSED to be to non-Freemasons."
3,loud,"perfect for boys or girls who don't want their siblings to enter the room, is quite loud, especially when not turned off during the night..."
1,bad buy,"I bought this phone based on the good reviews posted on Amazon. They sent me a gutted, cheap shell of a phone. I even tried to use just the handset on a different phone, even that didn't work. Very disappointed!"
4,Very decorative wall phone,Very decorative wall phone.Volume control is OK.It is hard to keep piano black finishing clean (by the fingerprints)Mounting to wall is not so easy. I had to stick it to the wall with a double sided adhesive tape.
2,A gimmick,"I tried this in a store once and was really unimpressed. Vibration is not my idea of massage. The speakers were poor in my opinion. Some people may find the game vibrating feature to be cool, but if you're looking for a massager, look into one of HoMedics other massager cushions with motorized balls such as the SMB-200, SMB-300, or QRM-400. They're more expensive, but they're easily worth the difference if you want something to relax you. And for audio, get some good ear buds, headphones, or a real audio system that can really immerse you in sound."
3,more of a sound chair than massage,This chair is more of a vibrating chiar attachment than a massage attachment I like it more for games and music (thats why i bought it). I leave the vibration function on for like 5 minutes because it numbs my back and then gets annoying if your looking for a cheap game chair buy this it works great as a surround sound system since the speakers are behind you. But if your looking for a massage chair pony up a few more dollars and get something better than this
4,Surprisingly Good,"I purchased this item for two reasons: 1. for myself due to the massage feature (which vibrates more than massages) and 2. for my husband to enhance his gaming experience. Both of us have been pleasantly surprised. However, we wish it were wireless. Thanks!"
5,Was a much loved gift,"I bought this for my son-in-law who is a total geek for anything electronic so it's hard to buy for him because he pretty much has everything electronic that he wants. So when I saw this in my Gold Box offers for under $50, I snatched it up for his birthday and know what? He loves it! He was really impressed with me for getting it and says that all of his friends at work (where he took it) are jealous and want one for themselves. BTW, he's a film/TV sound editor so he does know his electronics and so do his co-workers. Great product!"
2,HoMedics iCush-100 Immersive Audio Sync Massage Seat,This is an ok product. Not thrilled though. The massaging part is not a massage at all but a violent vibration. Wouldnt waste my money on it.
2,Regretful,"Academically, this UCB/UCD grad & U of Mass history professor is sound, a bit dry, perhaps a bit overreaching at times. Growing up in Northern section, I was aware of the conflict, that California once might have been split. But the title and, indeed, the quality antique photos upon the cover, were misleading, for this is not about the Gold Rush and its participants, but rather about the ""Great Men"" who played the ""Great Roles"" and ""made"" the history, and their immediate compatriots.... not about the common fellows who traveled from Northern and Southern States, and how they, now 2-3000 miles from home, were terribly torn by the oncoming conflict, what they felt and experienced, how it impacted in the camps and on the flats, and the choices they came to make, which is what I'd hoped for. For that, one star; for the academics, 4, averaging on the lower side."
3,Good try,"I think that the authro had an interesting hypothesis and did attack the Civil War from an interesting perspective. But, the bottom line is that California was never really threatened to become a slave state or leave the Union at the time of the Civil War. I think it was a real stretch to suggest that those hypotheses were any more than very unlikely and really didn't even come close to happening. I believe that the vote was over 80% in favor of ""free state"" status."
5,absolutly pleased,"Brought this item as a christmas gift. The person I was giving it to was extremely pleased and several people in the office wanted to know where I got it from, so I would have to rate both the product, and the store that I purchased it from (J&R Music World) very highly"
4,Great Movie,"I saw this movie at SlamDance (a neighbor to Sundance) in January of 2006. It's hilarious, quirky, and all-around fun. Okay, your grandma might not enjoy it that much, but if you have ever been stuck in a dead-end job and felt your life slipping by, this is the movie for you!"
5,Extremely satisfied.,"As an ECW fan since 1995, despite the great reviews, I had chosen to skip viewing these titles as to not ruin my memories.When I finally decided to view ""The Rise and Fall..."" this 2 pack offered by far the best value as it came with ""One Night Stand"" and was actually far less expensive than either title alone.Despite ""living through it all"" I actually learned a few things about the promotion and was able to relive some classic ECW moments. The bonus features alone were worth the cost.ONS was an amazing show, with a solid roster of ECW Originals as well as the infamous JBL/Blue Meanie shoot.Though the items come packed together, they are individually wrapped leaving you to add the one youre after and sell the one you have if needed."
3,"One good, one bad",The title says it all. The ECW collector pack comes with the documentary of the ECW and ECW: One-Night Stand.I am a fan of documentaries. I thought The Rise and Fall of the ECW was well done and interesting. There are tibits about the promotion that casual fans would never have known. I definitely think it is worth the money.ECW: One-Night Stand was a money grab by the WWE. THe WWE bought the ECW because of the popularity of the extreme style of wrestling that was slowly growing. They brought in a lot of the old ECW wrestlers and while it was fun to see them....it wasn't the same and most of the PPV was focused on the WWE superstars showing up and threatening to disrupt the show rather than on the actual ECW wrestler. It was just a disappointmet and is actually a dvd I gave away.
5,Another Hit,"John Anderson is one of the few ""real country' singers left. Country Comfort is a great album. If you love country music, you'll love this."
4,He's right! AAARRRGH!,"Yes, he does reccommend a vegetarian diet for children. And...he tells us exactly WHY. This book is thoughtfully written and has easy to understand explanations of food and how it effects our (children's) bodies. I found myself questioning what I thought was healthy eating for toddlers. This is a great book that lacks recipes. I want to know what snacks to take to the beach and on a long car car drive - you can only eat so much fruit! And beans & rice are not finger food."
3,Satisfactory phone,"I've had mine for a little over one year now. It's held up well to abuse from throwing it around, etc., but it's showing seriously irritating signs of use now. Using the keypad is especially frustrating. Many of the buttons register two presses for every one time that I press them. I'm constantly backspacing! I'm currently shopping around for a replacement."
3,Knowledge is Power- empower yourself,"Knowlege is power and this book will empower you with knowledge on how the government likes to keep track of everyone through laws such as the ""Freedom of Information Act"", the ""Privacy as of 1974"" Computer matching of information on you, if you want to learn about the different files that are kept on you, you need this book."
2,Not competitive with other books on this topic,"This 310-page book contains about 75 pages of information. It makes a strong beginning with an overview of the main features and concepts of STL, but the rest consists of alphabetically ordered and painfully repetitive specifications for each class.Usage examples are contrived with no connection to real-world programming problems. They take the form of complete main functions with output displayed on the user's screen.The index is incomplete and crucial definitions are either omitted or circular.A better choice is Mark Nelson's ""C++ Programmers Guide to the Standard Template Library"" (ISBN 1-56884-314-3)."
2,"Introductory primer, not much more","This book basically provides an introduction to each of the major containers, iterators and algorithms, then the second half of the book provides an alphabetical reference of all templates.Poorly organized, poor and simplistic examples, no depth, no red thread. Nothing on using and developing custom value types, containers, iterators or algorithms. The online help of MSDN (Visual Studio) is better than this.I guess it was important to be the first one out with an STL book, and it shows."
4,"Compact, useful and easy to read.",I am tired of books which go on for hundreds of pages and end up telling you nothing. This book tells you everything you need to get started then spends the rest of the time giving you a reference you can use when you start working with STL. I found it easy to read and understand. The layout of the pages helps make it easy to find the information you need. The programming examples illustrate the points being made.
2,leather case is not good,I ordered this kit from Amazon. The case supplied is made for v500 and not at all fix v600 in it. You run into another problem when you connect earbud to it. The case disconnects earbud from jack when you open the phone.
1,Bad ear phones,The ear phones are very bad. The voice is not clear getting noise. Not worthy to buy this product.
2,Worse Worse Worse Raw and its PPV r Worse,What the hell People are thinking this PPV to be best PPv ever HanDx ohhh all this PPV had and the were against whom- Spirit Squad . 5 man who dont know hoe to wrestle Han.Dont buy it.

I mean hes nothing special he used to be in a fricken tag team and all of a sudden hes some awesome wrestler. He hasnt proved he can withstand a 20 minute match and it looks like by summerslam umaga will be in the title picture(unfortunatly). One other thing is cena. i mean i dont think hes the worst wrester like others say but hes held the title too long i mean come on wwe cant u mix it up a little. give edge the belt or let HBK get the title again. i did, still, and will always think of john cena as an intercontinental champ or united states champ, not the wwe champ."

3,Maybe not for our part of the country,"We bought these as a school supply to make a 1st grade weather chart. They're cute, my daughter likes them and the size is just right, but the selection doesn't work real well. We need more snow, more sun, more partly cloudy and less rainbows, storms and wind. But, hey, every place is different."
2,Incorectly tabbed transcripts,"Beware when purchasing any AMSCO books that tab AC/DC.... some are correct, but alot, infact TOO MANY are tabbed incorectly... i dont just mean there in wrong positions... i mean they havent even tabbed the same song... its half and half with this book... half the songs are ok and correct.... half are bad and sloppy...dont pay any more then $10 for this. There is too much that is incorect. AMSCO dont even take the time to realise they have incorect tabs, because there still putting the same WRONG tabs into there latest books! Avoid AMSCO, or dont pay alot."
1,Really?,One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty.Not even once.
3,Runs Small,Very nice well made shoe. It runs small however. I ordered a 8 1/2 but my heel hangs over. A size 9 would have fitted perfectly. Wish there had been some indication that the shoe runs small as I had seen on another site AFTER ordering the shoe from Amazon.
4,Interesting book.,"This is a great first-hand account of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. It gives great insight on the emotions of the boycotters, and the determination that kept them going. The book is a little slow at times, but it's well worth it in the end. It really shows the intricate details that made the boycott successful."
5,A look at the past,"A personal look at the people, thoughts and motives behind the Montgomery Bus Boycott. This book is engaging, thought provoking, and a must read for everybody."
1,"Well, at least it's inexpensive...","A box of ancient public domain exploitation titles dating back from the dawn of sound movies to the early 60s, Girls Gone Bad is a collection of bad films, cheaply mastered, mostly from poor VHS sources. There are very limited pleasures to be had from these films, and those pleasures are not enhanced by the general visual cruddiness of the package."
3,Very esoteric,"If you do not have a firm grasp of the esoteric (an oxymoron, perhaps) this text is entirely too dense in meaning to be deeply grasped. It is not, as with most texts by Bawa, traditionally recognizable to Sunni or Shi'i (even with their acceptance of the importance of ijtihad and the hidden imam) as an authentic Islamic text. It should, however, be recognized as authentic from the standpoint of solid monotheism (not monolatry), and bears itself as a whirlwind of inspired vision of the Beloved. A firm understanding of both classical and indian Sufism as well as vedanta may be advised. Not a casual read."
5,great. Very detailed and structured.,"Peters life and with jesus. HIs death, and birth. ALl told in this book. Was crucified upside down."
2,Should be good.,"I have an 07 Jeep Wrangler which is one of the vehicles that this kit is for. Trouble is that the part with the notch cut out (the largest piece) isn't deep enough for use with a stock ball joint as their own instructions describe. Plus it is made out of material that is too thin-walled so the inside diameter is too wide. This allows it to slip off the ball joint lip as it is being pressed into place.When I buy a special tool that is designed for use with my vehicle, I would expect it to work. Got to wonder if they ever actually tried it before they said it fits."
5,Dana 30 Ball Joint Tool,"These worked great to remove and replace the ball joints on the Dana 30 axle under my 1998 Jeep Wrangler TJ. The quality is far superior to the Chinese Tool Store stuff. It costs more, but is very much worth it. The removale tool is angled perfectly for the Dana 30."
1,Broken Claw,"I bought this hammer for my husband for christmas & when he went back to work at the end of January, he used the hammer for 4 weeks and the claw broke off while he was using it. Really disappointing for an $80.00 hammer!!!!"
5,William Herschel - musician and astronomer,"I purchased this to play to my astronomy class, but fell in love with the music and play it for myself. Herschel was a musician first, and became an astronomer almost by accident when he read a book about optics written by an author who had written one on music. Like so many of us, he wanted to read something else by a favorite author -- and then got caught with the telescope-making bug. More than a constructor of telescopes, he discovered a planet and found a career. But, the music never left him and this recording Concertos for Oboe are charming. The CD also has one Haydn symphony. Enoy."
4,A little dated but still has good information,Some of the material is dated but over all I learned what I wanted to know. Meaning much of the book is as meaningful today and when it was first published. Glad I made the purchase.
4,Works well with antique desk.,"Very happy with the quality of this keyboard tray. We needed a keyboard tray with mouse tray that could slide into the 24"" wide kneehole of our antique, oak desk. Fits perfectly. I may have mounted it a little to far back trying to hide the mechanism. The mouse tray bumps the desk's drawer pull in some positions."
5,Great keyboard tray!,After struggling with another keyboard tray I found this to be the solution to my troubles. It is sturdy and adjustable and a purchase that I would highly recommend.
2,Horrible instructions,"This is a very solid, seemingly well-built keyboard tray. My problem is that the instructions that came with it were horrible. I was able to attach it to our desk without a problem (as other reviewers suggest, nice template, etc.). That's not the problem. Unless I am missing something, we CANNOT move the tray down or tilt it as it is supposed to. There is a lever that seems like it should go up and down and back and forth but it doesn't move, and I'm afraid I'm going to break it. There are no instructions detailing this. There seems to be a diagram on the arm, but it is underneath the rolling mechanism and I can't read it without moving it down, so I'm stuck. Called customer service and they referred me to Waterloo (the manufacturer). I got voicemail there. Hoping for a call back, but I'm not super optimistic."
1,Absolute junk,"Item shipped directly from Hong Kong, so it took weeks. At least 7/10 had bent pins, and a couple were completely broken (most likely due to inadequate packaging). I am very disappointed."
2,Can't tell the difference,Bought this with a cable amp. Attached to the unused ports.. I could not tell the difference. Save the bucks or just pick up a couple at Radio Shack.
3,It's OK,It is as good as any of these I have seen or used commercially. With the advent of LTE 4G phones these little items could see an increase in demand in homes. Seems these phone work in specific bands in the range of 670-760 MHz and can bleed into your cable TV and mess with the signal on TV channels in that range. These are frontline defence and should now be on all open cable bulkheads.
5,Improve your TV signal.,"Great way for almost no money to make your TV signal just that little bit better. When you have cable or an antenna feeding the wallplates in your house, put one of these on every unused one, and on any splitters that have ports not being used."
5,Rollicking good fun!,"If you have ever been on a car trip with your kids, then don't miss this book. After a trip to through the drive through and with Dad focused on driving, the inside of the car carefully....deconstructs. Of course the kids have to clean up the mess so there is an excellent message in this story. Lisa Campbell Ernst's delightful drawings draw the young and old alike through this great fun tale. This book is great fun!"
5,Love This!,"This book is adorable. A lovely rendition of ""The House that Jack Built."" The words are carefully chosen and the illustrations are engaging. We got this from the library and love it. It is now on our ""to buy"" list for Christmas gift-giving. Because there are messages here for children and adults as well, both the reader and the one being read-to, will enjoy it. And I love the fact that the children clean up at the end."
2,Hmmmm....,"Interesting premise -- sexual obsession, suicide, fantasies... but I couldn't get past the choppy, dispassionate prose. Couldn't figure out if it was stylistic or just bad writing. Guess that means it was bad?Too much S&M; to make it appealing to me."
3,Very interesting read,"Definitely twisted and dark, but also sexy. Not for the conservative. Gives you an inside look at abusive relationships and the twisted sexuality that often encompasses these relationships."
5,The best pens ever!,"I've been using these pens for about 15 years....and though I've TRIED to move on to others, have always come back to these. They are just the best."
5,Great Pens,"They aren't ""runny"" like other similar pens. Ink last long as well. A great buy overall, will definitely purchase again."
5,LOVE IT!!,these are my most fav pens after staedtler and papermate!!! they don't bleed through.. perfect to take notes. i'm def buying again soon as mine runs out :-)
4,"Great Pens, Not as fine as I'd like","These pens are great and flow really well, the only thing that would make me like them better is if they were a bit finer, but then again I like pens to be as fine as possible so I can't really complain."
2,barrel thin and slippery--ink bleeds through pages,"Cons:stressful on the wrist: barrel is thin and smooth plastic. It requires a firm grip which causes wrist pain if you write for long periods.Ink bleeds through to reverse side of page making two sided writing unsightly.Pros:The flow is consistent and smooth(however if you pause at all with pen on the page, ink continues to flow creating ink blotches."
5,Loyal Fan,Been using this brand of pens for YEARS!!!!Nothing more to say about them if you like precison writing in COLOR... :-)
5,Pens,I ordered these pens because I like these pens. They are smooth writing and the ink flows consistently. The color variety is a plus.
5,Best Pens Ever,"I am a ""pen-aholic."" I've purchased many packs of pens for the pretty ink colors and have been disappointed by many. However, these are quite honestly the best pens I've ever used in my life. With terrible handwriting and a need to write very fast (in med school), these pens provide extremely smooth, fluid writing with constant use. The pens write very boldly, but the extra fine tip allows for great precision. The only flaw of these pens (which cannot be helped) is their high tendency to bleed through the paper. Therefore, I only write on one side of the paper. Definitely worth it though! They are especially useful in drawing out complex diagrams whose elements need color differentiation."
4,Love them,"I'm a pen person, and these are my favorites. I carry several different colors in my purse at all times. The very fine point really works for any situation, even filling out tiny forms at the Social Security Administration. I love also that you can see how much ink is left. People who borrow these pens ask me all the time where I got them. There is one drawback, though. In the past 6 or 7 years that I've been using these pens, about 3 or 4 of them have burst, and it's messy. Also, just last week, I was working from home with the computer set up on the bed, and a pen fell onto the comforter with the point digging into the comforter. It was there for probably about 30 minutes until I realized it, and it did leaver about a 1/2-inch blot on the comforter. Again, if you don't do idiotic things like that, these are great."
3,Ok,"I wouldn't buy them. You see,I bought thee pens in a store and the pens it only worked one time worked one time. Spend your money on better things."
4,It's true - fewer wins achievable on this model.,"This is my second Radica solitaire game... my first was their 'Solitaire Lite' which I loved and which lasted several years until I could no longer use one of the keys. This newer version does have a larger screen which automatically lights in dim ambient light, but as someone else noted you DO get noticeably fewer wins on this model, which is said to be the result of a programming error. I'd say I get about 50% fewer wins on this model versus my previous one. Also, scoring is supposedly in multiples of five, yet somehow I often end up with scores that end in a '3'. While disappointing, none of this stops me from enjoying the game. It still beats using real cards."
3,Radica Solitaire Lite,"I've been using the Radica Solitaire Lite for at least 10 years now and this has been the 3rd one I've gone through. I do NOT lile the ""Improvements"" they've made to the machine. Much prefer the older models."
3,Go back to the old version,"As others, I have earlier version of this game and am disappointed with the modifications made. The new colors on the screen make it hard to see the card stacks. The background light only worked for a few minutes and has finally stopped working all together making it even hard to see the screen unless you are in bright daylight. The buttons for the deck and suits have been made smaller. Call me clumsy but I am always hitting the card stack buttons by mistake. And the new game button has to be wiggled a lot before it works. So while overall it is an okay game, it is not as nice as the earlier version that I have."
4,Big Sceen Solitaire,"Product has larger numerals that most comparable games of its kind do not have and I find that helpful. Interesting aspect: when you WIN a game - and know you are going to do so - sometimes there seems no more cards to take from the pile(and you need a couple more cards to complete the WIN. Then when you get a couple of Kings put away, the game just completes the WIN - taking the missing cards from ""who knows where"" as they aren't shown. Don't know if this is an error in programming, but it doesn't seem to bother the WIN. Other than that, it plays fine. Would like to see the one card turnover instead of always the three card turnover."
4,Never Ending Solitaire!!,"I have several of these. One at the kitchen table, one at my bedside. So that when the urge to play hits it is right there! My only disappointment is with the light. For some reason the one on mine doesn't stay on so I still can't play it in the dark! These are durable and the batteries last a long time. I play them for hours at a time and even been known to take them with me, tucked away in my purse. Don't know what would happen if I did not play at least one game a day :)! I am truly addicted to these and even bought them for my Mother and now she is addicted to them also! Got to go and play a game!!"
2,Quality has deteriorited,Radica used to amke good hand held electronic games; this was is cheap. Buttons need to be pressed unusually hard to respond. dark screen that lights up only when the room is nearly pitch black.
1,Please!,I am shocked beyond belief at the prices you think you can get. The games wew $15---$20 at walmart and you think your going to get $100 & more. PLEASE!!!
4,Are you kidding?,"My wife and I really enjoy this game. However, we have played it so much and so often that now some of the buttons are losing function. I bought this two or three years ago, however, so that's not so bad. But when I checked on ordering another one, I found the price had gone to $160+!! Come on, Amazon, there isn't a hand-held solitaire game in the world worth that much."
4,"Older, ""Unimproved"" Version much better","I ordered this from Amazon and delivery was great! However, that is where it stops. Except for the ""undo"" button, this improved version is a pain!I love the older version. The screen was just as big, and the machine was much more compact and easy to hold. This bulky version gives me a hand cramp!Not only that, but the backlight no longer works--after a week!! The numbers are hard to see and lack the depth of color of the older version.But the biggest pain is the new game ""button."" And I am being generous in calling it a button--it is a nib. AND you have to press in with all your might with a fingernail to make it respond.I love hand-held Solitaire games, but this version is a dud! Don't waste your money--buy another version. At $50, this is highway robbery."
2,Almost impossible to win,I have had the Radica big screen solitaire game about two months. I was forced into a new unit when my old game by another maker disappeared. The light no longer works and I have run the cards only two times. Almost all of the time I get no more than five or six cards up on a good run. I would never recommend this toy to anyone based on the poor odds of winning or even doing well. Children do not need to be exposed to this kind of frustration. I also find it almost impossible to see the suits and often make poor moves because I cannot see how many cards are left in a pile. The manufacturer should pull this product until all programming glitches are repaired.
3,"Okay, not great","Nothing makes waiting at the doctor's office etc. easier than playing solitaire. But the old one I had you couldn't mute until after it played a VERY loud intro for a new game (embarrassing)and it also didn't light up. This one is nice in that you can mute it at all times, but the feature I liked when I looked into it was that it lit up. However, this just seems to mean for a short period of time when you first turn it on, then the backlight goes out. Unless I'm missing something, that's not nearly as helpful (especially since we've been getting a lot of blackouts in our area and this is my only amusement.) Still, it's a GREAT time waster. :)"
5,Packed with TedLeoly Goodness!,My girlfriend got me this as a random gift because she knows how much I like Ted Leo and the Pharmacists. This DVD is great! There's 9 live songs and various interviews and insights into the band's life/history. Very fun to watch. I recommend it to any Ted Leo enthusiast.
4,"Good film, good DVD, whacko sound editing","Despite this being a live experience, I still think they could have played with the sound so that Ted's voice was a little more prominent over the other instruments. He is immediately drowned out once the band begins playing. On the other hand, the set was good and the music was played masterfully.The DVD extras, in-betweens, and such also add value, if you are a Ted Leo/Rx fan and you are thinking about purchasing this."
4,Long life & doesn't heat up,"Have had this for over 3 months for my Thinkpad. Was worried about the recent battery scares, but an excellent perfomance so far. Lasts up to 6 hours, does not heat up. Highly recommend Thinkpad users with 18 month old notebooks to switch."
4,My Favorite Cephalopod Socks,"When you are looking for cephalopod socks, sometime the options are frustrating. These socks feature octopi wrapping their arms comfortably around your feet while coyly hiding their beaks, making an aquatic fashion statement second to none.These socks are occasionally hard to find but are well worth seeking out. They are comfortable and correctly sized. My only critique is that they are slightly too thin for my taste, although mine have been quite durable thus far.If you want to proudly display the most intelligent of all Cephalopoda on your feet (and who doesn't?) I heartily recommend these socks."
5,You octopi all my thoughts...,"Thanks for the laugh! I too have these socks, I bought them a few years ago at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, CA. I actually find them to be quite thick for the type, and they have held up very well. It's fun to wear them to work, all dressed up but knowing I have octopi on my socks. And if someone's lucky enough, I'll give them a little look at my octopus socks."
5,Journalist's Requirement,All journalists should be encouraged to read this witty book as well as other members of the chattering classes. It is rather surprising how a little math and common sense can shed light on so much tripe in the paper and on TV.
2,Underwhelming,Some interesting anecdotes don't save you from feeling a little cheated by this book which promises an entire mathematical world view but only delivers a few snippets.
2,A mixed bag,"This book had a few good examples of how numbers are used and abused in the media. The book was genenrally good when it kept its discussion to narrowly defined cases (the contamination of a pollutant in the water, e.g.). However, the discussion of the broader issues, especially any topic to do with ethics, came across as astoundingly naive and uncritical its hidden assumptions. Much as the author would like to believe, not every problem is quantifiable, at least not in the simplistic way done here. Read this book if you want to see a reason why mathematicians do not hold all the answers."
4,Foxy Numbers,"Have read only a few pages as assigned to date- very good, so far.As concerns vendor action, it was very good and book was received ahead of schedule and in very good condition."
2,"Good idea, poor execution",I found this book numbingly dull. After about 40 pages I lost any hope of maintaining the one-minded devotion to extract the interesting concepts buried within.
3,"Useful but fragmented, like the newspaper","This is a clever and useful book about the foibles in the media's use of statistics, with short primers on complexity, psychology, and probability theory -- and an occasional lapse into philosophizing that ends almost as soon as it begins. Ultimately this book, deliberately written so as to emulate the fragmented, unsustained format of the newspaper, suffers from this very cleverness: no issue is taken up long enough for Paulos to do it proper justice, very much like the newspaper (and television) reporting of which he is so rightly skeptical."
4,good sequel to Innumeracy appropriate for news readers and writers,"This 1995 Paulos book is written in the form of a newspaper, with many short chapters not particularly related to each other, grouped into sections--politics, economics, and the nation; local, business, and social issues; lifestyle, spin, and soft news; science, medicine, and the environment; and food, book reviews, sports, obituaries. Each chapter is headed with an actual newspaper headline that bears some relation to the topic discussed.The book has a few minor repetitions from Paulos' other works, but is mostly new material. It is entertainingly written and informative, providing useful information about how to critically analyze a wide variety of subjects, suitable for both readers and writers of newspapers and other forms of news reporting, including blogs."
4,Would make a good discussion book in all kinds of classes,"This is a more accessible exposition of his ideas in his previous book, `Innumeracy'. It consists of a very eclectic collection of short essays that I think can be illuminating in a myriad of class settings: science, critical thinking, philosophy, math, and journalism, to name some.By its nature, however, it can be somewhat redundant. Also, the point of a good number of the essays seemed elusive at first reading. I found a lot of his footnotes more interesting and worthy of further discussion, and would've liked them to become expanded into their own essay.Besides the print media, his criticism and advice can be suitably applied to the electronic media and beyond."
3,Amusing,"This is a book full of amusing anectodes relating mathemtical concepts to the daily newspaper.While the book reads easy enough and is mildly entertaining, I felt a little disappointed. There was no unifying theme or common thread, and it left me wondering what point the author was trying to make. Perhaps that was intentional.I would have favored a theme, nontheless. For example, the author could have shown how mathematical concepts are consistently abused and misused by news writers. Sometimes the abuse is to further a particular bias or point of view. Sometimes the abuse is unintentional.But the author doesn't really go there. One gets the impression he wants to, but something is stopping him."
2,"I wanted to enjoy the book, but was disappointed","There seem to be very few actual newspaper examples, and too many contrived discussions. Comes across as preaching at the reader, but without enough facts to back up what he says, in my opinion. Not that I don't think journalists stretch the truth a lot with their misleading and misinformed use of statistics -- I just think with some effort the author could have included more real-life examples. I really wanted to like this book, because I think the subject has great potential. However, I would have to agree with the review of Ian Westray and say that I was somewhat disappointed."
5,Wonderful book for parents and caretakers,This book provides significant information about first grade education and is a wonderful resource for parents and caretakers.It reads like an insiders guide to first grade and encourages you to learn ways to be truly beneficial in your child's education. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
4,An excellent book!,"This is a great novel! Hershey really has done his research on international and military affairs. A fictional story about events that really could happen to the United States, it's a personal story filled with high stakes drama and adventure, reminding me of my own childhood imaginations. I couldn't put the book down!"
5,Loved it!,"This book is an attention grabber from the beginning. It has a well rounded cast of characters that are easy to identify with and keep you invested in their welfare. I could hardly put this book down, and I felt for the plight of each character in their individual conflicts (especially that of Scrub). Most historical fiction books tend to get slow toward the middle and end, but this book, by the young author Peter Hershey, kept me interested through all 260 of its pages."
1,the Voice of Poet Robert Frost,"Well to be honest and to be fair to the poetry, Robert Frost may write well but his presentation is disappointing, also I was a bit disappointed with the selection. this is definitely one case where one was purchasing a pig in a poke had i heard and seen the segments i would not have bothered.marie ryanthat is not to say another maybe more erudite person might love both the selection and presentation."
1,So disappointed,"I rented the CD at the local library and could not wait to get home and play it. Was I ever disappointed! I could not get over the poor sound quality. It sounded like Mr. Frost was sitting in a huge room, far from the microphone, recording his wonderful poetry into a cheap cassette tape recorder. Really, he was too old to record (poor vocal quality) and in my opinion, he read too fast."
5,The Voice,Listening to Frost recite his own works is amazing. I cant think of anything beyond that that needs said.
4,Beautiful Poetry,"The poems of Robert Frost are remarkable; soft and peaceful, his voice is slow but sadly the sound is not great (not terrible, either)."
5,Beautiful Recording,"I am a novice to Opera I found that I have this in my cd player more often than not, and love Robert Guarino's amazing tenor voice.. A+"
2,"Rare, but sadly disappointing","As a professor of voice I purchased this CD with great hopes. I am always on the look out for recordings of accessible repertoire sung by professionals with sound technical skills. Unfortunately Mr. Guarino's inability to execute the demands of the repertoire at the mp, p, pp dynamic levels denies the music its charm and very purpose for study. (The quality of the audio recording is poor as well.) The music is beautiful, but executed as orignally composed with all dynamics observed, it can be breath-taking. A tragic missed opportunity. I hope some day there will be someone who can record these songs and do them real justice, both emotionally and technically."
3,It was an ordering error,"Apparently Mrs. Santa Clause got clicking happy on the shopping cart and ordered this one by mistake. Oh well...I also ordered the 4D. All things being equal...pay the extra few dollars for the 4D model. This one is sturdy enough if you put it out of reach of everyone and everything. Sometimes the fins fall off....the dorsal fin is MIA right now.And it gives me the feel of 8th grade science class, when the books and equipment are 20 years behind the times."
2,Really light weight,I've had two of these and they okay for $100 I guess. Just put them up in good weather and take them down before anything bad moves in because they can't handle much wind and a few weeks of intense sun will start rotting the cover.
2,"Nice product, but terriblesupport","Best product for my needs. Looks great. but box came repackaged and retaped from someone else who had obviously rejected it. no rugged carrying bag with wheels, like promised. been working for days on the phone and yet no resolution other than turning the whole thing back in. just send me a carrying bag."
4,another good Parker novel,"Using his Richard Stark alias, Donald Westlake penned many novels using the Parker character. First published in 1966, this was labeled ""a novel of violence"" by the publisher, but nowadays the violence in this story wouldn't raise many eyebrows at all. In other words, it's not very graphic. Nevertheless, there is some blood and mayhem and few bodies left in the wake of Parker and his crew. Are they really bad guys or just charming thieves? This is nothing at all like Westlake's light-hearted Dortmunder crime caper novels, but if you've read the other Parker novels you know what to expect. This isn't the strongest in the series, perhaps because it's dated in some respects, but it's still strong enough that fans of the series should enjoy it."
5,Outstanding!,The ideal book for teaching embroidery to school children - hard to imagine a better introductory book.
2,sloppy work,"The guy who wrote this obviously isn't a true Bama or Auburn fan. Too many small factual errors, and its obvious that some of his write-ups were based purely on the box stats rather than having watched the game or even talked to someone who saw it. For example, he writes about Auburn's 31-27 win in 1996 without mentioning the late Alabama drive that almost won the game on the last play. He also doesn't seem to have paid much attention to these two teams generally. For example, he writes that Bama beat Tennessee in 2000, and ended the year 5-6, when my beloved Tide lost to the Vols and ended a miserable 3-8. I saw similar mistakes about Auburn's history. But it is a comprehensive review of the entire series, and it has a summary at the end showing the scores of all Bama and Auburn games from the 19th century through 2000. I can't recommend buying it, but if you get it as a gift, like I did, its worth flipping through."
4,storyteller,"Mikaela falls from her horse and is in a coma. Her husband Liam, a doctor, is in charge of the family and children along with his mother-in-law Rosa. When nothing else seems to work, he makes a call to Mikaels's first husband, a famous, sexy, good looking, first love of her life movie star named Julian True. His voice brings her out of her coma. She has no memory of her life with Liam or her children. Over time, she regains her memory and remembers her deep love for Liam and her family. Forever, she promises him as they trim the Christmas tree. Enjoyed this book very much. A good read for a rainy day with no interruptions."
4,A wonderful Love story,"Wow. What a wonderful book. I read Kristin Hannah's ""On Mystic Lake"" and fell in love with her writing style. I had to read more of her books. The next book i found of hers was ""angel falls"" This is a powerful story with characters who seem to come to life. Liam becomes the ""perfect"" husband in the way he shows how much he cares for Mike. Julian is a guy that ever girl has in her life. A man that you love because of passion and obsession. Julian is every girls dream and he knows that. He isn't able to love the way Mike (aka Kayla) needed him to. THis is a wonderful story with many exciting parts. The only bad thing about it is that it ended."
3,Predictably written,"This story's premise is a good one, but it's a bit too ""tear-jerky"" for me. All of us women would like to have a husband like Liam, but I think he's definately not a living-breathing human male. I have never heard of a man that is that sensitive and romantic and under all circumstances. For those who love a heart-warming romance story, this is the book for them. For me - I need something more realistic."
3,Disappointing for such a fine author,"Having just finished Hannah's Winter Garden, which I devoured, I checked out Angel Falls with great expectations. I keep notes on the books I read, but this one had no notes. Although I read it just a few weeks ago, I honestly had to read the other reviews to remember what the story was about. I found it entirely unmemorable, although an easy beach read."
3,Good but not a favorite,"I liked this book a lot. It was a good story, but not one of my favorites by Kristin Hannah. My 2 favorites of hers are ""The Things We Do For Love"" and ""Winter Garden"". This one I thought was a little slow from time to time."
2,Not my Favorite,I have recently become a huge fan of Kristin Hannah and have been reading everything I can find of hers. I love her character development and the layers in her story telling. BUT I was left looking for something else in Angel Falls. I found it almost boring. The whole secrets and lies and undying love and dedication was over the top and unrealistic. I felt like she was grasping to make it 'juicy' and it just fell short! One of my least favorites by her.
1,"375 pages of sappy, irritating drivel","This is quite possibly the stupidest book ever written since ""Where The Heart Is"". Given the choice between reading this and licking a Chicago transient's backside, I highly suggest the latter course of action. Fully given from a feminized point of view, the plot unfolds in expectation that years of a wife lying to her husband should and will be easily forgiven. Highly unrealistic and socially dangerous feminist sentiment abounds in this novel, cover to cover. Men are soulless, accepting drones. Women get away with whatever they choose. Long live the New World Order."
2,A romance novel The Christian Right would be proud of,"""Angel Falls"" was very disapointing especially when I was expecting meatier fare. Usually I read Nora Roberts or Virgina Henly and I am used to either alot of plot twists or a few sexy bedroom romps. This book has niether. What it does have is a very tedious plot and absolutly NO sex!!!!!If you are looking for a juicy romance to sweep you away this book is not it!!!!!!!!"
4,"A nice, solid read","I liked this book a lot, but I wanted to like it more. I thought it had a lot of unexplored potential. First, the movie star guy was so awful and two-dimensional that I couldn't figure out why the heroine EVER fell in love with him in the first place. (So I lost respect for her.) I had the same problem with the ""hero"" in Ms. Hannah's HOME AGAIN. He was never redeemed in my eyes and quite frankly, I didn't care if he got a heart transplant and lived or not. I also thought the conflict in this book didn't really start until Michaela woke up from the coma, then the book ended too quickly. I think the writing was very good, but the book needed more genuine sentiment and less sentimentality. I did love Dr. Liam and also loved the main message of the book which is that true love isn't the fireworks, but the glowing embers that can last a lifetime."
3,Quick read but predicable,This is the fourth Kristin Hannah book that I've read and is somewhat predicable. I always enjoy the character development but these characters are stereotypical of a romance novel.
3,Disappointed in the end,"I've enjoyed Ms. Hannah's books in the past and and liked this one until the end of the novel. I don't want to give the plot away, but frankly, the sudden about-face of the heroine is unconvincing. I'd check the book out at the library or wait for it in paperback. Not a keeper."
2,Not her finest effort,"Coincidentally, I read ANGEL FALLS consecutively with Barbara Delinsky's COAST ROAD, so maybe it wasn't a fair contrast, but both novels deal with virtually identical themes, a wife/mother who lies unconscious in a hospital. How the women get to the hospital differ, yet that's just a detail; the exploration of the impact of the enormity of their illnesses on their families, and the uncertainty as to whether each woman will survive, are absolutely the same. Delinsky's characters were far more believable and sympathetic--even, in the case of COAST ROAD, the self-absorbed ex-husband. Her characters evolved in response to their crisis. Again in contrast, the most intriguing plot point in ANGEL FALLS, the hidden first marriage of the heroine, could have, should have, been explored with far more information and interest. Fans of Kristin Hannah may be disappointed in this eagerly awaited novel."
1,Don't buy this book.,Sorry but this bookwa boring and slow. Would not recommend. this is the 2d book from this author selected by our book club. I will be sure not to read any others from this author.
4,What can I say?,"While looking in the library, i came across the book ""Angel Falls"" by Kristin Hannah. It gripped me at first with the sequence where she gets hurt because it was so suspenseful, but other than that, the story was very depressing. The character of Liam is made to be such a sweet man and yet Mikaela, no matter how much they revered her, seemed to be a mildly selfish person, especially in the case where Liam loves her bone deep but she doesn't exactly love him back in that same way. It reminded me of unrequited love. Although I may be a sucker for ""happily ever after"" endings I must say that it was a bit enjoying. I would advise buyers that if they are looking for a cute and cozy romance, I would recommend ""A Walk to Remember"" by Nicholas Sparks instead of this."
5,Another Kristin Hannah Gem!,"Kristin Hannah has become one of the best writers fiction has to offer at creating emotional stories which are absolutely un-put-downable! In ANGEL FALLS she tells the story of how Mikaela' Campbell's family is affected after Mikaela lapses into a coma as a result of a horse-riding accident. Her husband is willing to do anything it takes to increase her chances of recovery, even if it means that with her survival, he could lose her to another man. With all the poignancy which has become a hallmark of Kristin Hannah's novels, comes a story beautifully written, and an absolute gem. Highly recommended!"
4,Angel falls.,Angels Falls is another book that Kristen Hannah touches on things that are sometimes uncomfortable. I enjoyed reading as I do all her books.
2,not so good,"Love her books but this one was hard to get through. It was overly dramatic and eye-rolling in parts. ""She let her fingertips linger on her daughter's cool sunken cheek"" and ""she gazed up at him, her dark eyes steeped in sorrow"" type of stuff. I'd say pick another one of her books because she has some really good ones, like Winter Garden for example."
4,Angel Falls,"I liked the story. The main character, Liam Campbell, is an incredible human being; father and husband. He is to totally devoted to his wife and children."
3,just so-so,Bought this as a gently used book from Hastings. My first Kristin Hannah novel. The storyline was a little too predictable for me. I would liked to have seen an epilogue as I had a couple of unanswered questions. All in all I'd give it a three star rating and will try another book by Kristin.
3,Dreaming,"This book is pretty good. I like it, but it doesn't have most of the stuff I dream about in it, like forests of ice cream for instence. I think it gives pretty good interpretations. I would recommend this book to people with normal dreams."
5,Hidden Meaning od Dreams,"The art work in this book is alone worth the price of the book, but the content is also worthwhile. It is a slightly different format and I really like how Mr. Hamilton approaches a dream symbol or whole dream from different angles, it does help tremendously. I have seen him work on various television shows and he is extremely talented. There is no fluff here, just workable, useful information."
3,It was ok...,This book wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I found the story entertaining enough but still fairly boring and contrived. I wouldn't recommend buying...
2,Disappointing,"I was so looking forward to this book but it did not meet my expectations, I was even speed reading over the ""racy"" scenes. I am currently on page 281 and struggling to finish it."
4,Get A Clue,I really enjoyed this book. It sort of felt like one of those 'who done it' murder mystery/romance novels. The liked the main characters as well as the secondary characters. All of the secondary characters were very suspicious. So it was really hard to tell who the killer was. I found myself skipping ahead a little just so see who the killer was. Loved the ending. Definitely through me for a loop. Loved it.
3,Really Jill Shalvis?,"I am a huge fan of Jill Shalvis so when I saw this book I bought it immediately. I was not impressed with her attempt at the""who dun it"" story plot. I liked the chemistry between Cooper and Breanne, but the staff were a bit of a far reach and the plot twist at the end had me raising my eyebrow saying ""you're kidding me right"". I love Jill Shalvis books, but this one just did not work for me."
2,Kind of dumb,This book is not worth the price. It has a flimsy storyline and the characters are not well developed or believable.
4,Exactly What I Expected,"The Glass Carboy arrived in a cardboard box, but was packaged with sufficient bubble wrap to prevent damage. It was unscratched and undamaged out of box. I was a bit surprised with how small a five gallon carboy would be, but it is true to its sizing. A bit on the heavier side, so be careful when moving carboy outside of the box."
1,TORTURE to watch- AWFUL,I read the reviews saying how terrible this movie was- but i thought that it couldn't be all bad- so decided to watch it_ and i was proven wrong- it was ALL BAD_ If you enjoy bad films for the sake of watching how badly something can be filmed/acted/plotted/framed- by all means you may enjoy this one--some people enjoy having bad movie nights- so i suppose this movie would be good for some yucks and laughs for that alone
3,"A vampire gay love story, okay for a rental.","As terrible as this movie is, I really enjoyed it. At it's heart is a cute little love story between two guys and it's a fresh take on the ""vampire-in-love-with-a-human"" story that is, although words cannot described how creepy everything about it is. It really is a crap movie, but I enjoyed watching the two main characters together. Oh, but I must say, epic-fail on the ""big"" fight scene, though, cause it doesn't look like they tried. If you can put up with low quality indie films and enjoy a cute(but akward) love story between two guys, rent it (and yes, there is a decent penis shot if that's what your looking for, but don't expect pants off from any of the main characters or even a real sex scene)."
2,B movie at best,Truely fits in the class of B movies...Poor acting allround. I think they could have used the 300 dollar that it probably took to make this movie and put it to better use......Please do not waste your time or money...
2,This should have worked,"Vampires and gay people. What a combination. Those two popular subjects should be an opportunity to have some fun. Well, as for me, I could barely sit through it. The entire movie seemed to be based on odd coincidences. The only actor I was at all familiar with was Dylan Vox. While there was something that bothered me in Homewreckers and Longhorns, he really set my teeth on edge in this one. He's not much better in hard core, so I'm not sure which way is trying to switch over.Dreadful."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"Grade-Z gay-themed vampire movie. Neither erotic (Bela Lugosi was sexier), frightening nor even interesting, this one is a loser on all counts. The acting is terrible, the dialogue inane, the songs are awful. This is sort of a David DeCoteau wannabe, but without the delicious campiness that makes some of DeCoteau's movies so much fun to watch. ""Vampire Boys"" isn't fun to watch. It's excruciating."
2,Even Twilight Has More Bite Than This,"Vampire Boys has plenty of boys, but you would never guess that they are vampires. This movie is pretty dull stuff. Even Twilight was better. And the actor who played Caleb was horrible. A lot of the dialogue was stilted, and there is very little action. I think the movie would have been more successful had it been called ""Pretty Boys"" instead. That's the point of this movie anyway. The point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because there isn't an ugly person in the cast. That counts for something, right?"
1,Terrible,"The movie was really bad. The dialogue was bad, the acting was bad. The whole thing was really bad, just a bad movie."
1,A WAIST OF MONEY,The previews were miss leading. I thaught this would be a hetrosexual romance story. Like boy looks for the girl of his dreams. Not Boy looks for Boy. I didn't even finish the movie since it does not intrest me.
2,"not awfull, but...","Not awfull, but i didn't know that vampires can't use contractions. That's right, the main vampire can't use contractions. Why, I don't know. It might just be bad acting.I blame it on the studio that made this film. It's less than B grade, but still has a few good moments. Very few. My favorite is the full front body pan of a realy hunky straight boy that lasts less than five seconds.Bottom line: If your drunk or stoned it's more fun than re-runs of 'Cops', but that about it."
1,It sucks.,"Now I know vampires suck. And gays too. Cool. But this whole movies sucks. I love horror flicks and also a good gay drama. But this film is simply boring. Where the vampire could be threatening and erotic at the same time, the action is hardly shown. The characters mainly talk. Big mistake, because the acting and dialog is too bad. Teen Wolf was fun, but there are no really good gay horror flicks at this time, I fear. Therefor I prefer to keep watching gay dramas and horror films with straights who are much more sensual then the guys in this one."
3,More entertaining than expected,"For a short, low budget movie, I didn't find it bad at all.... The charactors were interesting enough.... As for the main vampires accent, or lack there of, I think it was supposed to be old english.... After all, he is 100 years old.... Acting was fair to good, some better than others.... Everyone likes a movie with a happy ending of sorts...."
2,terrible 3rd rate acting,This movie was not as bad as others have written however with that being said it was not good either. The acting was high schoolish at best. The actors gave the impression of remembering their lines before they spoke. The settings were the same ones with different angles or even close up shots. really no imagination to the sets. There was very little interaction with the people of the supposed town and so that gave the impression of the cast being the only ones in the town.Finally the fact that the beautiful bodies get naked was not enough to warrant buying this movie or seeing it. Sooner or later someone will get the idea that gay men want substance in thier movies and not just eye candy and obviously staged sex scenes between actors.
2,Not good...but good to laugh at!,"I was not a fan, although I did not expect much. I knew going into it that the movie would ne campy and corny to say the least but watching the trailer, I expected a little better acting. The movie might be one to watch when you have had something to drink and you are with friends that can laugh over the horrible plot holes and script. It is not worth the time or money if you are trying to find a good movie for a night in. The boys were hot...but be forewarned there is some fully erect penis action that was unnecessary."
2,Disappointing!,"These are very nice looking, however they have very little stretch and are cut very small."
5,"For a REAL John Wayne Fan, great!","I AM a John Wayne fan, and I have only a few of these movies on other discs. I used to have some on tape. I WILL watch them more then once and they are some of the best movies you can get. A real John Wayne fan would really appreciate these older movies. The quality of older movies are not of the primary concern for a real fan. The story line, the action, the many aspects of what makes John Wayne, the Duke! His style can still be seen in these early films. I recommend them."
4,Best set of John Wayne's B-westerns,"This set is made up primarily of B-westerns that John Wayne made before his breakthrough role in Stagecoach. However, just because they aren't his best films doesn't mean they aren't still good movies. Most of these films didn't have big budgets and shot in only a few days, which was normal for a lot of smaller pictures back then. These films allowed John Wayne to learn how to become a true star and you can thank these films for giving us THE DUKE.However, if you're not pleased by the majority of the films in this set, there is a silver lining that comes in the form of McLintock! and Angel and the Badman, 2 of Wayne's greatest westerns.This set, or exact copies of it can be found in the $5 bin at Walmart, K-Mart, Target, or most thrift stores. Its a great bargain and will really give you more insight on how John Wayne grew as an actor."
4,great gift for dad,"I bought this as a gift for my dad who LOVES John Wayne and has seen about every movie he has ever been in...i like the fact that it had unseen footage and it was a very good price. I wish i had more information to offer, but i have a great dad and he would never tell me if he didnt like a gift his daughter gave him!!!"
1,These are not the movies a John Wayne fan wants to see.,"Is your husband a John Wayne fan but you have no idea which movies to get him? Save your money and skip this collection. Most John Wayne collections consist of forgetable movies from early in John Wayne's career. Amazon has a good collection of movies from later in his career, so concentrate on those instead. Yes, they will cost more, but your John Wayne fan will actually watch them repeatedly, unlike the movies in this collection. Some of my favorites are, The Shootist, The Cowboys, True Grit, The Sons of Katie Elder, Rooster Cogburn, Who Shot Liberty Valence, War Wagon, The Searchers, Rio Bravo, Big Jake, etc."
1,the John Wayne 100thAnniversary Collection,was very disappointed in the product.Films where to old.Unfortunately in your advertisement it did not specify what films where on it.
1,"Highly biased, beware of biased author","I wish I had reviewed the author's background BEFORE reading this book. He is a salesman (excuse me - wealth advisor) for separately managed accounts SO no wonder he hates mutual funds. They are his competition.What could have been an objective discussion of the pros and cons of each degenerates into an infomercial for SMAs and bashing of funds.If you're an investor seeking objective information, look elsewhere. Beware the praise here from other financial salespeople."
1,Disappointing effort on an interesting topic,"Not knowing much about separately managed accounts (SMAs), I got this book to shore up my knowledge. I was not at all satisfied with it. Its central points about the advantages of SMAs over mutual funds could have been made in 20 to 30 pages at the most. However, the author stretches out the main text (not counting appendixes) to 220 pages by repeating himself over and over ad nauseam. I hate to slam an author, but I was actually insulted that Wilkinson wasted my time by putting out such an inferior product. His publisher (Dearborn Trade Publishing) should be ashamed as well. It's time people involved with publishing books on the financial markets take their mission a little more seriously and stop producing such dreck."
1,Weigh the risks and the rewards,"On page 16, the author urges the reader to ""Face Facts"", noting that, ""A mutual fund portfolio that loses 25 percent in a single year needs to return 33 percent to get back to where it was at the beginning of the decline."" Umm, that's not unique to mutual funds. If I own four cars and one is stolen, a decline of 25%, I will have three cars left. Replacing the fourth car represents a 33% gain (one divided by the three remaining cars). Mutual funds certainly have drawbacks, but like any investment, the investor needs to weigh the risks against the rewards."
5,AMAZING,This book couldn't be easier to read. So much useful information any investor can understand.
4,"Great movie, not the best transfer...","There is noticeable compression and artifact detail noticeable in this transfer.I love this movie and have seen it literally hundreds of times. I'm glad to now own this on DVD but wish the transfer were a little better. From Beyond has an excellent transfer, this one is acceptable but nowhere nearly as nice.And for people that would compare a 30+ year old movie to something new, you've got to be crazy. Of course low budget movies from the 80's shouldn't be comparable to new gen movies. I wouldn't try comparing my current computer to the one I had in the 80's either."
1,"NO CAPTIONING, despite it advertised as CAPTIONED","*/begin rant/*Man, Amazon really has dropped the ball with their Closed Captioning effort (or lack thereof).This rating has nothing to do with the movie, mind you. It has to do with Amazon advertising that it is Captioned, yet no captions show up, even when telling the menu to turn on the captions.Remember, Deaf people can't learn to hear, so we need captions, period. To be in our shoes, turn your volume to MUTE and try to watch a movie. Yeah, no fun. The difference is that you hearing folks can turn the sound back on.Thanks for hearing me out (yes, Pun intended)*/end rant/*"
4,Hugely entertaining...,"At first I was a little unwarey of this film, but to see it is to be thrilled. It is very original and has similar black comedy moments to 'Evil Dead 2'. 'Re-Animator' definately deserves a cult status and I can't wait to see the sequel..."
5,Classic horror,"Are you kidding me? This movie when watched for the first time grabs you by the throat. And the good Doctor is antagonistic, incorrigible, and much much more. This trouble maker has you begging for more! He feeds what it is to plug in these gore movies in the first place. Maybe he will inject YOU! This is in my library of cult classics to stay."
5,re-animator: a step a head of the rest,"Re-animator emerged in 1985 as one of the greatest gore flicks of all time. Outrageous violence and camp are undermined by subtle humor as the re-animator (Jeffry Combs) goes on a bloody rampage bringing both animals and humans back to life. The pacing is swift and Combs plays the demented doctor to the hilt, leaving one reeling in both laughter and repulsion up until the gory conclusion which must be seen to be believed. A must see for the entire staff at the morgue!"
5,"Outstanding Horror-comedy with a little ""sex""","Combs plays a Medical Student ala Dr Frankstein, who can bring the Dead to life. Starting with a Cat, He moves on to his Colleagues. Plenty of Gore and fast paced humor. The scene in the Morgue is Hilarious, a real sleeper."
3,A decent film,Entertaining enough to keep the attention of those that don't have much to do. Strange enough to make the mind wonder. All together decent.
5,Gory fun.,This movie was even more gory fun than I remembered. Beautiful copy an laugh out loud funny. Definitely worth a 2nd look or a 1st if you have never seen it. Fun. Fun. Fun.
3,overrated but fun...,I could never see what all the fuss was about over Reanimator! it was good fun and gory as hell but does not deserve the status some people give it.I have seen the Elite dvd of this and it was great! I'm gonna be buying this one as well as i'm big on gimics and like the look of it.Its propably gonna look amazing and sound great too but to me the mid 80s was not the best of times for horror films and Reanimator was no exception.
5,Re-Animator,Awesome collectors edition. I've always enjoyed this film. Thank You for having this one available!!!
5,Re-Animator,"Probably one of the most horrifying movies in recent memory, it is also one that has it's audience laughing uncontrollably. A combination of grotesque and camp, the serious questions it raises are buried under an avalanche of hilarity and gore. Herbert West, a medical scientist, arrives at the Miskatonic Medical School to continue his research into bringing the dead back to life. With his glowing green serum, and his talking a fellow student into assisting him, he proceeds to disrupt the school. There is nudity and worse in the ensuing melee. The 2 DVD set includes a 70-minute featurette plus many other bonus material. For the mature-minded."
3,Re-Animator,"This deserves three and a half stars. If you enjoy a little schlock with your horror SciFi then you should definitely catch Re-Animator. Jeffrey Combs (Star Trek: DS-9, Voyager, Enterprise, etc.) is great and the rest the cast aren't bad. Your typical mad doctor brings the undead back to life to rip peoples heads and insides off. A bit grisly for those unacustomed to horror gore. The production values were not bad for a B movie. Overall a fun experience for teenagers and adults. Contains some nudity. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Van Helsing"", ""Frankenstein"", and ""Army of Darkness"". - C. Luster"
5,"I have seen this video, its a must see if you like the genre",It must be re-released now as it is a classi
3,Good for a laugh,"This a camp movie that's good for a laugh. Beware though, there are some pretty much gore and nudity in the movie. I wonder what H.P. would have thought."
3,"NEVER a classic, but good fun","Those who consider this a serious horror film have, I'm sorry to say, missed the whole point of the genre. Almost from the opening scene, it's obvious that Re-Animator is intentionally an over-the-top spoof masquerading as a serious horror flick, much in the Ed Wood mode, but not quite as bad. And it's an ejoyable romp, from the very deliberate (one would hope, anyway) overacting and scenery-chomping to the in-your-face gore to the major plot holes, the whole thing works to become a really off-the-wall yet amusing and eminently watchable film. But it IS a black somedy; there's no mistaking that. Go into it that way and you'll have a good time watching it. Watch it expecting a ""real"" horror flick, and you'll be disappointed."
2,A huge disappointment.,"Being a fan of horror and zombie films, I checked out Re-Animator with some fairly high expectations, considering the good reviews. I finished the film feeling sorely disappointed. Why? Well, as a horror/comedy, it's not very funny, and it's certainly far from frightening. Some moments are no doubt quite manically inspired, and Jeffrey Combs delivers a tour-de-force performance, but sadly, the thing that maintains most interest is either Barbara Crampton's nude scenes or the visual effects. The least this film could have achieved was work as a thrill ride, with some good zombie action, but even at that it's underwhelming. Either go back to Romero's Living Dead series or check out The Return of the Living Dead as a great example of how to mix horror and comedy."
3,3.5....over rated..seriously.,"..this movie is no classic..pretty gruesome at times..acting, decent...it honestly deserves the title of a 1980's frankenstein meets evil dead at best....dont blow your money on it..if its a fair price, by all means..but dont be dooped into thinking its a rare-out of print classic....peace to you.-"
4,Voodoo Zombies revisited,"Jeffrey Combs, better known as Special Agent Dammers (The Frighteners (Director's Cut)plays Herbert West in this delightful interpretation of HP Lovecraft's series of short stories. Herbert West is a medical student with an interest in death, but more importantly in reanimating the dead. With a nod to voodoo zombies, he uses a serum to reanimate the recently deceased, but lacks control over them, turning them into rampaging monsters similar to those later found in 28 Days/Weeks Later. Add a corrupt Professor/Doctor, a naive Med Student, his bimbo-esque fiance and her Dean father, Re-Animator is an almost Zombie movie that doesn't take itself too seriously with funny one-liners, plenty of gore, and a great score, reminiscent of Psycho. This film is recommended for fans of zombie movies (Dead Alive & Shaun of the Dead especially), cult films, and people who are just a little bit weird/strange/unusual."
3,Loved this movie-wanted to own it,We had seen this movie many years ago and couldn't pass up the deal.The box it came in is pretty hokey but it's still a good movie and holds up over time.
5,pure gore,"this one is way over the top, with its gorey set pieces and its awesome array of character's. Jeffrey Combs really is excellent as Herbert West, the man who re-animates the people. Bruce Abbott is also good as Dr. Cain. nice beheading of Dr. Hill(David Gale). for any one who has strong stomachs"
4,Its a cult classic!,It has been on my want list for years and hard to find locally. I am very happy with my purchase.
3,tongue-in-cheek,"If you can force yourself to not consider such logistics as how the corpses were able to get from residences to the morgue and vice versa without being observed by anyone...then this film is good, campy, gory fun in a B-movie sort of anyway. Of course if you're a Lovecraft fan than you will love the first half."
4,Perfect toothpaste if you don't mind preservatives,I love this toothpaste for the flavor and whitening ability. It's also a nice size that doesn't take up too much sink or cabinet space. Just make sure to keep upside down towards the end. I like preservative free products but just can't ditch the Colgate yet.
4,Not sure if I was on a huge losing streak.,"I read the book last night and put it to test on an online casino with live dealers. I wasn't sure if it's my bad luck or whether it was my long pending losing streak which even $400 was not sustainable for 2 hours. The book seems pretty practical and no nonsense. The thing was, I carried out exactly as the author described. But to no vain. I lost my pants. In my whole of 2 hours session I just had three 20s and a blackjack. I wouldn't want to blame the book. And in the three times I had 20 and the blackjack, all of them were pushed. The reason I took out a star is for my loss not to blame the book entirely. Just because it didn't work for me, it does not mean it would not work for others. Well, this is my honest review. I have another book coming my way by George Pappadopoulos. I shall share my experience with all who wants an honest review."
5,This Book Is Great,"I have won most of my sessions of play since I bought this book. It is very well written and the author does know what he is talking about. he has data to back up his ideas. If you don't want to learn how to count cards, then this is the next best thing. if you do want to count cards and learn advantage play methods I would recommend Best Blackjack by Frank Scoblette, who wrote introduction to this book, or KO Blackjack by Olaf Fuchs and Ken Ventura. But for me, I like the positive progression that the author describes and I really like the money that I've won!"
3,Mostly research and results in this book.,"The author presents many theories that are interesting and unique. My problem is that 90% of this book is research/results, and 10% is actual gambling advice. Who is the target audience? This book might be relevant to gambling theorists but is not helpful to your average gambler. I am a basic strategy player and felt let down by the lack of advice and tips. I still don't know how you could implement his quit point strategy in today's casinos with crowded tables and tight rules. I would give this book four or five stars if the book was 50% research and 50% advice."
5,Excellent Book,I have been reading Walter Thomason's articles in the great gambling magazine The New Chance and Circumstance and I have always enjoyed what he has to say. I have always been cynical of progressive betting systems in general but this book had gotten such good publicity that I decided to read it. I'm glad I did. I have been playing basic strategy at blackjack for 20 years but I could never count cards as it gave me a headache. This four step progression of Mr. Thomason (used with his quit point strategy) has worked for me in my last 15 trips to Las Vegas. It is a much better way to play than just flat betting or increasing ones bet on a whim.
2,Not One of Valerie's Best,"This book in my opinion left a lot to be desired. Tamara usually has more on the ball than she did in this book. I know she's no superwoman, but really her deductive reasoning was way off base here. And, does Basil DuPre have to show up all the time. I'm honestly a little tired of him."
5,The first book I read by Valerie Wilson Wesley,"I loved this book. At first, I thought it was going to be boring, but it ended up being really good. I'm starting to love these Tamara Hayle mysteries and I don't usually like mysteries. The story had a a great plot and memoriable characters."
4,"WELCOME BACK, TAMARA - I MISSED YOU!!","I am soooooo glad Tamara is back! Don't you ever leave me again!! This book was true Valerie Wesley style. Tamara is still broke, still tough and still da bomb! I was sorry to see the Blue Demon go, it was so much a part of Tamara. For those of you who thought it was over for Valerie and Tamara - THEY'RE BAAAAACCCKKK!!!"
3,GOOD WRITING BUT GLARING DETECTIVE STUPIDITY!,"This was my first Valerie Wilson Wesley mystery and I was looking forward to finding a good new series based on the reviews I read. I like her style of writing, I liked her characters--though the mysterious boyfriend was a bit much. I had a big problem with what another reviewer referred to as ""her lack of deductive reasoning"". Tamara's assignment is to find Gabriella who is most likely holed up with her friend Rook. When Tamara (in a giant coincidence) spots Rook with Gabriella's stepmother she follows him. But rather than grabbing her big chance at tailing Rook back to Gabriella she instead stops to talk to him and, of course, scares him off. Huh? I found myself yelling at the book!"
3,I FIGURED OUT THE KILLER!!!!,"this was my first valerie wilson wesley mystery, though it kept my attention...i guessed who the killer was before she revealed it. i liked this book and will read others by valerie!"
3,Very Slow,This book was ok but it starts out very slow. It was free so the price was right. I am glad I did not pay for it since it seemed to take forever to get somewhere.
1,"Awful support, impossible to set up (on a mac)","I have been trying to set up this printer/copier/scanner combo from HP on my Mac off and on for four months, and thus far the copy/scan features are completely useless to me, the printing is slow, and it often fails to work completely. Just installing the included software caused my mac to crash unexplainably over and over until I turned all the extensions off and went through them painstakingly one at a time to figure out which ones it didn't like. HP's support is so clandestine and difficult to navigate it may as well not exist. They have online chat support for plenty of their other products, but not for this one, probably because they know what a mountainous pain it is to set up. Their phone support number is long-distance! They do not have drivers for mac on their website. If you own a mac, DO NOT buy this product!"
2,Disappointing,"Whilst the book looks great, it's obvious the writer was not in communication with the person who put together the accompanying CD. The files referred to in the book are not in the location described, nor do they have the filename described.Also, don't expect to get the results shown, even when following the instructions precisely.For $50 I expect better attention to detail."
1,Godawful wretched piece of tripe,"Fay Weldon's been funny before; let us hope she will again, 'cause she sure struck out this time. This thing is so utterly meanspirited that it had me wanting to kick men and smack women. Had I not been trapped on a cross-country flight with nothing else to read, I wouldn't have endured it. As it was, I wished I was able to open the window; I would have chucked it."
2,Traainz 2006 DEMO,"This is basically Trainz Simulator 2006 with out any of the good stuff(surveyor and half the routes).But, if you don't have a good/descent/O.K. PC, GET THIS GAME."
5,Great Find.,"This story delves into the fine line between Bruce and Batman. Great story, compelling situation that Bruce finds himself in. Definitively recommended."
3,Must read for the story arc,"Bruce Wayne: Murdered and Fugitive series is a good story arc. Nothing exceptional either in the story or the art. For some reason though, I do like the interaction of the other characters with Batman as the question his innocence.I do recommend it. I have read it a couple of times, so it is good enough to read more than once."
3,OK Batman read,"First Batman book that I have read which doesn't feature the Joker or Two-Face. However, as this seems to be part of a 3-volume series, who knows?The story has Batman being blamed for the murder of his former lover Vesper Fairchild. Thus, Batman disappears and the rest of the Batman Family gets together to solve this case. Although it seems to be shaping up as a whodunit, this seems to a case of having far too many costume heroes barging in for their usual cameos. The artwork is so-so."
1,Hard to understand - avoid this text,"I found this book difficult to read, not because the concepts were difficult, but because of the writing style. The author seemed to purposely use more complex or obscure terms whenever possible (well past ""utilize"" for ""use"") and never seemed to use 1 word when 4 might do.I have read many texts in a variety of humanities (and science) topics and have not had to stop and translate the text from English to English I could understand in many years. I feel sorry for any students that are using this text.It saddens me to see a book on language and teaching which is unclear, and attempts to create new words like ""innovatory""."
2,Not bad but over priced for what you get,"I bought a slightly slower version of this two years ago and I was okay with it then. I just recently gave it up because:1. It crashed a lot.2. It was feeling pretty slow compared to my desktop at work (I run a lot of the same e-cad software on both).3. I never seemed to get much more than an hour of battery life after the first year.I switched my entire setup to Linux (I'm bought a cheap Celeron based laptop, dumped windows and installed RedHat). For less than half of what I paid for my first iBook I have a much faster machine with a 14"" LCD and no Windows! I suggest you consider the same."
4,Great for quick research,"I just got this book at my library. I needed it for a report. It's the only book i needed! You can read the whole thing fast, and get TONS of information! It's perfect if you want to know more about her, but don't wanna read 250 pages. I sugjest reading it even if you don't know who she is."
5,Faye Brawner's guide to geraniums(pelargoniums),"I have been collecting pelargoniums for 20 years. Mrs. Brawner's book is the best available guide ever to the cultivars and how to grow them. The color pictures are abundant and of excellent quality. Please note that this book uses the common American name 'geranium' for the plants that are known to science as pelargoniums. If you want to grow perennial, cold-hardy geraniums you will need a different book."
4,A Delightful Rare Find,"My primary reason for purchasing this CD was so I could hear the opera, ""La Cantarina""--and it did not dissapoint. The vocal writing is very beautiful, and all four singers bring a nice amount of expressiveness and tone. The orchestra provides pleasant accompaniment, although it can become rather plodding in the bass. The two-act opera is all too short, but the CD also includes two other interesting works: Haydn's symphony No. 1, and the Haydn/Hofmann flute concerto. Both pieces are good, and solo flautist Emily Newbold brings a light and lively sound to the concerto. An excellent buy for Haydn & classical period opera fans."
2,OK for small cards,"I had no problem with this device using 1-2 GB memory cards but the SanDisk 4 GB card wont work. Also, it is a bit fragile -- the opening for the card isn't very crush proof."
3,Great Reader with Compatible Cards,"Had this reader for over 6 months. Works great most of the time. Cannot support anything higher than 1GB on SD cards, though I wonder if this is really a limitation on this card reader or on the Mac Book Pro.Also, Amazon's description of compatible cards may be incomplete. Here's what the packaging says on compatible cards: xD-Picture Card, MultiMediaCard (MMC), Secure Digital (SD), miniSD, TransFlash, and Memory Stick."
1,Does not work with my Sandisk SDHC card,"The Belkin site is complely unhelpful about the memory card formats supported by this device. My Sandisk Ultra II 4GB SDHC card certainly does not work. No problems with 1GB Memory Sticks and 1GB SD cards, though."
1,Beware this product!,"The Belkin F5U213 card reader does not recognise a 4GB SanDisk ULTRA II SD HC card. No problem with a 128MB Sandisk SD card - its icon immediately pops up on the desktop.Quite hopeless as the only reason the Belkin's Expresscard Multimedia Reader was purchased was to conveniently transfer images from a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2 digital camera. Belkin's website has no information.MacBook Pro 2Ghz Core Duo, OSX 10.4.10"
3,Works great - with certain cards -,"I was a big fan of this card when i got it. It sits in my otherwise unused expresscard slot on my Macbook Pro, and I never had to worry about having my USB cable or a USB reader for my digital camera.Unfortunately, I just bought a new SD Card (SanDisk SDSDH-2048-901 2 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card (Retail Package)) and it doesn't recognize it. The same card works fine with a USB reader on the same computer."
2,Works sometimes...,"I purchased this for a MacBook pro, it read my 1G card just fine, but when I insert my 2G SanDisk SD card it detected the card but failed to mount the FAT32 partition making it useless with this card. I have had no problem using this same card with a USB reader on Windows or Mac. The Belkin web site did not have any support suggestions"
3,Really 2.5 stars,It works with one of my 1G memory sticks (SanDisk ) but not the other (Lexar). Both memory sticks work fine in my camera. Update: Today I found that it will not recognize my 1G SanDisk SD card. Not a dependable product.
1,Belkin Multimedia Reader & Writer F5U213,Useless. MacBook Pro does not recognize cards. No info on Belkin siteBelkin Multimedia Reader and Writer ExpressCard ( F5U213 )
1,Frustrating,"It works unreliably. I have six SD cards, four Sandisk Extreme III 2GB cards and two Sandisk Ultra II 2GB cards. The reader reads two of the Extreme III cards but not the other two, and it won't read any of the Ultra II cards at all. I am using it in a MacBook Pro, 2.33GHz Intel Core 2 Duo.I hope to find similar, more reliable product."
2,I have a 15.4 Macbook Pro and this only works with 1gb and below,Only time this actually works is with cards under 1gb. Anything over 1gb and its a bit flaky. Sometimes it will work if you jiggle it a bit. Not worth it and now I am looking for a new one.
1,Product already used when it arrived,"DO NOT buy this product from this company. I received this product this evening, opened it up out of the UPS box and immediately saw that the Milwaukee box had been opened up quite a few times. I took the Impact Wrench out of the box and it had scratches and dust all over it. This had clearly been used and I couldn't believe it. BTW, this tool does not come with a charger or battery, that cost extra."
1,Stay away from this recording,"Non of the singers are up to the challenge of their parts. The orchestra on original instruments sounds dull and uninspired. Great opera, but this recording does the music no justice."
1,DOA X2,"First unit arrived and was unable to connect to internet. Called 3Com. After usual phone attempts, they said they would send a new one. 3 Weeks later after no new unit, I called only to find out that a hold had been placed on this unit and no one could tell me when the new units would be available. 4 weeks after that the second unit showed up and also was DOA even after downloading the new software that was supposed to help."
2,Revere Copperclad Bottom 1 quart Covered Saucepan,"The product is a cheap, light-weight pan compared to the Revere Copperclad pans I know and love and have had for years."
3,Not as good as the old pan.,This product has been cheapened. It is not as heavy as the previous pans. I like the price and the handles are great.
4,try again,"I have a bad habit of getting involved in things outside the kitchen, with dire effects on my pans (usually just boiling water) I now set my kitchen timer as a warning for when the water will begin boiling."
2,Keep Your Receipt!,"Earlier this year I bought two one-qt. covered saucepans to complement my 36-year old Revere Ware set. The knob feel off one of the lids after a couple of months of use. Suggestion--if you buy any Revere Ware, keep the receipt."
2,Not for smooth top ranges,"When I got a smooth top range for the first time, I had to throw away a lot of pots with ""bumpy"" bottoms. A pot bottom needs to be flat in order to make good contact with the range surface. I ordered a few new Revere copper bottom pots as replacements, but the very first time I used them they developed a bump right in the center of the bottom. I think Revere pots must be too flimsy to maintain their shape when heated."
4,Great little pots,Get for cooking for one or two people. Just the right size. Copper bottom helps to quickly heat.
1,American-made Revere was of higher quality.,"The difference in quality and weight of newly manufactured (overseas) Revere saucepans and those made in America half a century ago is obvious when placed side by side. I am STILL using several 1960's pans, and they remain in BETTER shape after all these years of use than the ""new"" ones I bought that dent so easily. Young owners of the ""new"" Revere will not know the difference, making ""ok"" or ""acceptable"" the new standard. How sad is THAT?!"
3,Reverewear,"I have a larger RevereWear, copper bottom saucepan/double boiler that I have used for over 30 years and decided that I needed a smaller one, too. It is an excellent product and if I am not ""raving"" over this one purchase, it's because it's exactly what I expected in looks and function. It did arrive in a timely manner. Although shipping was almost half the price of the product, at least it was not more than the item (with many on-line and catalog companies it is!)"
2,Revere copperclad bottom 1-qt. covered saucepan,"On this particular item the inside of the pan tarnishes very quickly. I was not very happy because I have been using an old Revere ware set for thirty years. My current purchase was not satisfactory to me.Beverly LovaasSan Jose, CA"
3,Semi satisfied,"I had been looking for a 1 quart Revere pot to add to the ones I already had for many years. I looked in many stores here in San Jose Ca and could not find one. I checked on line and found one offered on Amazon and decided since I had done business with you before, I felt safe in ordering. The product came in a timely manner and I have no complaints with Amazon but the pot was not as good as the Revere I had for many years. It was not made in the USA but in SerLanka or somewhere overseas. It is not as heavy a pot as my old ones and and the bottom is not smooth but rippled. I have used it but do not think it will last as long as the ones I have had for over 30 years that still look and act new."
1,I was so disappointed!,"I thought this product got a lot warmer than it actually does.If I had to describe how warm it got, I would suggest you sit on a chair for awhile, get up, and touch the back of your hand to the chair, or think about how warm your bed feels when you first get out of it in the morning. That's about how warm this product got....not effective for deep conditioning AT ALL."
2,Does not heat up at the back,"I'm not sure if I purchased a defective product or not. Though the sides and front get hot, the back does not get hot AT ALL. I can feel the coils at the back so I know heat is supposed to be flowing through there. But the cap is completely cold at the back. And the weird shape of this thing makes it difficult to slide it backwards so that some of the heat from the top gets distributed to the back.As I said, the sides and front heat up quite nicely, so much so that you will need to protect your ears from the heat. I've used this product weekly for a couple of months and I think I will give it away. Time to invest in a counter-top steamer or some such product."
3,Decent Product for the price,I got my heat cap SUPER FAST!!! That I give a 5! The heat cap itself is just okay. It doesn't heat in the back so you have to adjust it to get complete coverage. It is still better than having to lug my hooded dryer out. I just wish it heated up evenly.
3,Not the best,I'm disappointed in this product. Performance is just so so. Just gets a little above warm at the highest temperature and the back (nape) doesn't heat at all. I'll keep it (I have to turn it around to hit all the spots on my head) but I wouldn't purchase again. I suspect it won't last too long either (probably 6 months I'll be looking for a new one.)
5,Great for small animals,"This product is GREAT! At first I was frustrated, until I realized I set it up wrong. Once I figured it out, it worked perfectly. It just needs to be set up against it's natural curl. Save yourself the time and just watch the instructional video on the website found at (grrreatwall) don't forget the w's and the dot com. I love the convenience. There are so many uses for it. I just wish I had purchased it sooner."
2,Not for our Chihuahua,"We purchased this as a way to keep our little Chihuahua puppy confined so he didn't get into trouble, but as soon as we got it out of the box we realized it wasn't going to work for us. It seems too unstable and he didn't appreciate the fact that he couldn't look out and see what we are doing. We were very concerned that it would tip over if he jumped up on it (and he only weights 1 pound). We ended up returning it and getting an indoor dog playpen, which is working out just perfect."
1,Not for Rats,"I bought this to contain a litter of rats but the thing curled in on itself. Even the mama rat was able to crawl underneath it.I did set it up ""against"" the curl but it still would not stand up."
3,"Great voice, not so good CD",I love Basia's voice - beautiful and unique. I was a little disappointed in this CD though because the volume of the instruments was so loud that it drowned her voice out! What a bummer. The music arranger should be fired.
3,Nice,"This is a very nice debut. Good songs, not great, but well produced and tastefully arranged. If the songwriting gets better we might hear more from her."
3,Good and bad,"Good:OS X doesn't crash all the time like the old Mac OSes! Yeah!!! (For the first time ever I had a Mac on for more than a day without a crash!!!). So yeah, OSX rocks!Cheap!!Bad:Not the best components. Get a good padded bag, if you set this thing down to hard, stuff starts to fall of.Slow. Slow, slow, slow. But then who buys a laptop to run more than Office or a few card games? More than adequate for students, and light business use."
4,A Healing Modality,"Thomas' book is an insightful look at the path to spiritual growth and development. He clearly articulates the nature of conflict within congregations (although his model is applicable to any organization) and provides critical thinking about how to address such conflicts in a way that is meaningful and courageous. I found his discussion about people who function as victims and saviors by doing a dance of immaturity to be very provocative. His call for principle-based leadership, while not new, is very refreshing in a congregational context and challenges those of us who have congregations centered around charismatic leadership to abandon our cults of personality.This book will be most helpful to congregations that have not fully understood or articulated their mission, vision and values. It will provide a very capable framework and guidelines to begin those discussions so that ministry can go forth as a ""healing modality"" in our broken society."
4,"Cute, but...","I love raccoons, so I decided to add this little guy to my collection. He is OK, granted raccoons typically have more than 3 stripes on their tail. This toy is also markedly asymmetrical, one ear and eye patch is bigger than the other -__-Other than that, this toy is a soft beanie that you can either collect or play with. So..."
5,A panorama of violence,"This 1993 publication by Human Rights Watch shows how the government used the emergency powers included in declaring a ""state of internal commotion"" to coverup a shocking number of abuses by the Colombian armed forces. The abuses included extra-judicial executions, disappearances, rape, torture, the wanton burning of homes, crops, and food, indiscriminate bombings and aerial strafing, beatings and death threats."" This book has balance, it also includes violations by guerrillas in Colombia who engaged in ""a disturbing pattern of violations of international humanitarian law, evidenced by the killing and torture of captured security forces officers and attacks on civilian targets. The violence in Colombia is complicated. Consequently, this book is valuable in helping understand the government's long pattern of indifference to the military's insidious ""dirty war."""
5,Lots to learn,I have learned alot about myself & my new partner. I wish that I had this tool when I first got married. This series makes me feel like I will make it this time. I feel rejuvenated and I look foward to completing other books in this series. I feel like I am living a different life; a new life. I have lots of things explained and I find myself referencing many of the different scriptures.I am thinking of getting a group together and setting up a group so that my friend & I can incorporate the views of others that may help us to further out understanding of the word and our relationship... I love being in love with the Lord and the man in my life...THis series is a great gift for engaged couples. that way you can save the marrige before it starts....
5,Great Little Spreader!,"I bought this unit to spread sand on my long steep driveway. I was hoping it would be a good alternative to the commercial units selling for twice as much. I was right! The assembly manual wasn't very helpful, but if you look closely at the photo on the box, you shouldn't have too much trouble. In about 1/2 hr, I had it assembled and mounted to the back of my Jeep. Once you get the adjustments correct, it does a nice job. I ended up bending the 2 side shields out to about 45 degrees to get a nice 12' wide spread of sand. The toggle switch on the cord works great and allows you to drive around and turn the unit on and off so you can sand only the areas you want. Gone are my days of falling down on the icy driveway with a shovel full of sand! I'm sure this unit would work well for seed & feed also."
1,"Poor quality, might be able to spread grass seed!","I bought this spreader to spread salt on a driveway. I realized it was borderline for the job as soon as I received it, and should have sent the unit back. Decided to give it a try, and I successfully spread salt 2-3 times before the motor quit working. I was also very careful with the unit. I never left any remaining salt in the unit after spreading. So it was put away clean and dry each time it was used. So now there's three hundred dollars down the drain. Need a salt spreader? Buy a name brand unit from one of the plow companies, and be prepared to spend at least five hundred or more."
4,EZ Up isn't a permanant shelter,"I've used EZ Up tents for years at trade shows and other venues. Since I saw a review here that said it was used as a shelter for 8 months and then it failed, I thought I'd point out that these are not permanent shelters. I had one fail due to rain damage once. Left it outside after our wedding (it covered the caterer table) and we had a torrential downpour. The canopy filled with rain, the weight broke the support. It was a tremendous amount of water, the equivalent of a person sitting on a single crossbar.The reason EZ Up likely told the person they don't cover wind and rain damage is because in eight months, the thing had to have been rained on, and blown at.If you're looking for a fast to assemble cover for trade shows, street fairs, etc. EZ Up's great."
3,Customer,"The E-Z up tent arrived in three boxes as stated. When unpacking one of the boxes I noticed a broken piece of white plastic. I later discovered it was a slide piece that is used to raise and lower the tent. I looked up the piece and it costs about $10.00 plus shipping, and alot of work to put it on. The tent once assembled is very heavy. It will take four people to open and close. Other than that the tent is very nice looking."
5,Most Impressive Sawzall,"With 75 trees on my lot with many dead branches to trim, I was most impressed with the quality of construction and ease of use of the Milwaukee Sawzall. Cutting power and battery life are more than acceptable and recharging the batteries is a snap."
2,Average video card,"Asus AX300SE/TD Radeon X300SE 128 MB DDR Pci-eThis video card is pretty old fashioned! I bought this cutie only to build my new Athlon64 PC, sinceI spent too much in my new MOBO and CPU and other accessories and was running out of money I thoughtof buying this card only to upgrade later.I can say it works fine enough, it allows me to run every common aplication (involving video)at standart settings. It has DVI and a standard TV out wich works fine. It will run pretty fine onold games from half-life opposing force, Quake 3, to Unreal Tournament, Blood Omen 2, etc. So thiscard will be enough for the standart not much pc enthusiast. But you'll be in trouble if you attempon playing today's late standarts, like Far Cry, Unreal Tournament 2004, Half-Life 2 or even worstDOOM 3. And don't you ever think of benchmarking this card!!!, at least not in 3dMARK05."
4,a good one,"Jessica reveals her vulnerable side when her mother has tests for cancer.While leval-headed Elizabeth calmly goes about her business,Jessica has as over-active imagination aas always and is convinced her mother will die,and cries alot.People feel so sorry for the poor girl that they let her have the lead in the school play,no auditions needed.When Jessica finds out her mother has had nothing more than a flu,she has a hard time deciding whether she should tell people,or keep her part in the play.!"
2,Revereware not what it used to be,"My wife and I have used our Revere ware for over 30 years and have loved it. You can imagine how relieved we were to find that it was carried on amazon as it is no longer available in our local stores. So we ordered two pieces right away to replace those that had been broken. You can also imagine how disappointed we were to find out how cheaply made the new revere ware is. We had the old 2 quart pan to compare to. The Cu cladding on the new one is almost non-existant and the pan is very light - a further indication that the Cu cladding has been cheapened considerably. And instead of uniform heating throughout the whole pan, the new stuff is the worst of all our cookware; you can even see the electric ring marks through the pan. Save your money and buy something that will cook right. (PS I noticed on the stamping, our old pan was made in Illinois, whereas the new one overseas. )"
1,Disappointing failure in Quality Assurance,"Revere has a great reputation for durability, and it is very hard to find it retail (neither Bed Bath and Beyond nor Williams Sonoma carries this line either in regular stores or online). So, I was delighted to find it available on Amazon. The reality failed to match the expectation, however. The saucepan lid did not match the saucepan; just about 2 mm too small, so one could not cook effectively with the lid on. I had to return it to Amazon."
1,Copper bottom quality deteriorated,Not so long ago the quality of the copper bottoms of Revere ware was second to none. These days it is so paper thin that with the smallest amount of heat the pot warps and burns ingredientsRevere 2-qt. Covered Saucepan
5,Covered Revere Saucepan,Had a similar saucepan for 40 years and recently burned the thing so needed to replace it. So glad that Revere still makes the 2 quart and my new one is a wonderful replacement. The new one will probably last for 40 years so will pass it on to the grandchildren.
2,Revere 2 qt. covered saucepan,"Wanted to obtain more Revere Ware for a vacation rental property since we had a fair number of older Revere pots & skillets. Our ancient cookware has held up beautifully, and believe me, they get abused at a rental property. Purchased a new 2 qt. copper clad saucepan and immediately noticed it was approximately 1/3 the weight & thickness of our old wares. Sign of the times? We are quite disappointed with the quality compared to our older versions. Made In The U.S.A. doesn't seem to mean much anymore and I don't want to buy Chinese. I suppose I need to look for a new manufacturer."
5,This is IT!,"My mother had one of these saucepans and used it daily as far back as I can remember for everything from boiling potatoes to making gravy. When she passed away I took it and use it all the time. It came witha double boiler insert which also got (and gets) frequest use, particularly for melting chocolate. My pan has to be at least 50 years old, the handle is still tight and the cover still seals. It's as good as they day Mom bought it half a century or more ago. What more could you ask?"
1,Arrived rusted,"I purchased the 2 qt saucepan. Straight out of the box, it was evident that the little rivets connecting the handle to the pan were driven too far (all the way through the pan) such that they were sticking out on the inside. Moreover, these rivets must have been made of some other type of metal, as they were clearly rusted on the inside. Instareturn."
1,A BIG disappointment,"I fondly remember growing up with Revere cookware during the '50s and '60s. It was sturdy and manufactured with care to precise measurements. Unfortunately, this is NOT the same product. Apparently, Revere cookware is now being manufactured in some third-world dumpster. The overall construction is flimsy; it bends and dents easily. None of the lids fit properly. The unreasonably thin ""copper-cladding"" was unevenly applied and looks like a roller-coaster ride around the sides of the saucepans. Revere needs to clean-up its act, or go out-of-business."
2,They don't make them like they used to,I ordered 2 of these 2-quart saucepans because I had owned them and liked them in the past. I only threw them out after letting them boil dry and turn into molten lava. The pans that I bought in September 2005 were manufactured in China and did not measure up to the past quality of those made in the USA and Korea. The interiors are oddly rough and the knob on the top of one of the covers has a sharp edge. These pans are worth the $15.33 I paid for each of them and not a penny more.
3,Revere Ware Replacement,"The seller was quick and purchase arrived in excellent shape. However, I was disappointed with the product, not the seller. I ordered this saucepan as a replacement for an old Revere Ware pot I had for a long time. The difference between the old one and the new one is obvious. The new Revere Ware is not as sturdy, or as heavy as the original pot. It feels like a thinner pot with less copper on the bottom. So, would I buy Revere Ware again? Probably not. That's a shame. It used to be such a good name in cookware."
1,Junk...,"Chinese junk...August 2010(?) I bought three Revere Ware sauce pans through Amazon. I thought these would be the same quality pans my mother had years back, and what I had in the early 1970's. Not to be, and no longer made in America!Revere Ware is now Chinese junk, not the weight that the previous, made in America pans had. I gave them a onetime (very) brief try. The first pan I tried warped within a couple minutes. The pans are VERY LIGHT METAL with a VERY light coating of copper.I have a set of Al Clad that I like very much. I'm not a kitchen snob. Sometimes I just like a regular pan that does the job well. If a pan works, buy it! After sending the Revere Ware pans back I went to the local kitchen discount store and bought a much more quality pan for a couple dollars more and it works great."
1,Banged Up?,"The order arrived, but the lid does not seat in the pot. Apparently been sitting around in a warehouse for a while and may have been knocked around. Will need to send it back."
1,"""Copper"" bottom 2-quart saucepan (Target)","I purchased what was advertised in the photograph as a ""copper bottom"" saucepan. When it arrived, it was completely different. There was no copper and the bottom was unstable because of what I consider a design flaw. I returned it. I see that Amazon is still advertising - with a picture - a COPPER-bottom saucepan. This time, it's from another vendor. So okay, I am desperate to buy a COPPER-bottom 2 quart saucepan, so I will give Amazon another chance to make this order right. Otherwise, it's a case of ""BAIT AND SWITCH"" which is illegal."
3,Not as it used to be,"Like many companies these days, Revere cut some corners to save costs with this pan. The copper is not as thick and the pot has an overall ""lite weight"" feeling to it. Not my father's pot but I am using it as a second 2-quart pan so I will only be utilizing occasionally."
3,Not my mom's Revereware,"My mother had Revere pots when I was growing up, and as far as I know she still has them - they're that sturdy and well-made. I suppose if I hadn't grown up with Revere, I'd be happy with the quality of this pan - it's a decent saucepan for what I use it for, which is steaming veggies and fish and eggs with the steamer basket (Revere 2-Quart Stick-Handle Steamer). This pan is a little small for use with that steamer basket, though, as the lid doesn't fit tightly enough to prevent steam from escaping and so it boils dry in about 15 minutes. The copper kept heat marks from my stove almost immediately and so it doesn't have the beautiful finish my mom's pans had."
2,Wasn't for crap,had to beat the crap out of this warped pan so it wouldn;t walk across our glass top stovetop. It doesnt bring water to a boil very well. but it did come in a timely manner and I would not buy this item again.
3,Should be 3 1/2 stars,"I'll admit right off the bat I am a ""Storm of Steel"" guy. I read it first and was sucked right in. I picked this book up thinking it would prove more of the same but was quite mistaken. I believe the book has merit in that it explores a multitude of experiences and ideas he had perculating in his head. His ideas on the future warrior and the new wave of military hardware are rather uncanny and farseeing. It was enjoyable reading his ideas on leadership and know from personal experience he is right on. Irregardless the book is slow and choppy compared to ""storm of steel"" so if you intend to read this be prepared for the differences and enjoy the book for what it is."
2,Philosophy vs. Memoir,"Storm of Steel, Junger's more famous WWI memoir, is an excellent book, capturing a young patriotic German's response to trench warfare. It's full of details of daily life in the trenches and has a particularly good passage of his involvement in the Kaiserschlacht offensive. By comparison, Copse 125, only contains a few pages of war memoir. The balance of the book is philosophical tract based on zealous nationalism. If you want to read several hundred pages of why Imperial Germany deserved to win the First World War and rule Europe, well, be my guest."
3,only for the serious,"a reprint with poorly reproduced text. Its a good memoir from a German officer, with some ripping good bits. However, at least half or so is a lot of self reflection.So if you are really into the German side of WW1 in a scholarly way iots a great source. If you just want cool tales of fighting pass it up."
5,What a shame this was badly reviewed by someone who didn't even watch it,"I read the review of this DVD, and bought it any way. Obviously, the reviewer didn't even watch it.It is a deep, instructional piece that teaches you how to read charts and goes over the amazing chart of 2012. It is a great learning tool and entertaining as well.Finally, it DOES NOT predict the end of the world.It is a shame reviewers on Amazon can do things like this and get away with it."
4,Great shoe for a great price!,I got this shoe on sale for $26. I wanted a waterproof shoe for washing my car and doing yard work around the house which sometimes involved water. I like the shoe so much I might just wear it while going out also. Easy to slip on and off. The quality of the leather is high and the sole provides great grip.
5,awesome,this book is awesomely informative. it delivers (in Ilocano) the Filipino way of life and at the same time gives a discussion of the words and phrases used in the paragraphs of the story. i love to read this book because it depicts the Filipino customs and traditions. it makes me feel home!
5,The 4th Season of Dexter is the best one Yet!,I love Dexter. Michael c Hall is a great actor! All the seasons were great but season 4 was the most riveting! John Lithgow was wonderfully creepy as Trinity. The ending was shocking & Michael C Hall was amazing as always!
5,Watched the season in 1 weekend!,"We are Dexter-fanatics. We hadn't watched the show at all until we heard several different people comment on how good the show is. So, early 2010 we bought seasons 1-3 and watched them rapidly. We couldn't wait for season 4. When we received the box from Amazon with season 4, we knew we had to cancel our weekend plans. Instead, we stayed home and watched the whole season. Knowing we couldn't wait for Season 5 on DVD, which presumably will be Aug. 2011, we went ahead and ordered Showtime so we could watch season 5 as it's happening. It's a sickness, I know, but I don't want the cure....I want Dexter!"
2,Too Many Coincidences,"I was a Dexter die-hard. What a creative show: original, smart dialogue, dark humor, intellectual, thought provoking.Season 4 lost it. It slowly slipped away and fell off the cliff with the surprise (and disappointing) finale.Throughout each season, the viewers have had to deal with some unbelievable coincidences, but you could get by them because the show was so good.The Ice Truck Killer is Dexter's long lost brother and now engaged to his sister??? OK, I'll get by it because the show is too fun to let that drag me down.It's over for me in Season 4. Dexter has too much baggage now. It's piling up and impossible to believe that everything can tie up so perfectly and neatly for him that he evades the law."
2,Edited and no closed captions?,"I love Dexter. It's one of my favorite shows. I had to drop all of my movie channels, Showtime included, because I recently became unemployed. Was happy to find Dexter; but miss the unedited version and being I have a 45% hearing loss I also miss the closed captions. Wish this will get rectified! Otherwise, I love to thank Amazon and Showtime for allowing us fans to view these shows!"
5,Who doesn't love Dexter!?,"It's Dexter! Who doesn't love the way he gives badguys what they deserve ;) Love how he has a baby too, so cute!"
2,I love Dexter--just not Season 4,"Okay, first a Dexter watcher has to accept the premise of the show. But within the parameters set by the writers, there is no way Rita would accept Dexter being gone so much--not with the previous admission of drug use. Sorry, but this glaring flaw combined with the ridiculous coincidences in the Trinity case, I fear Dexter is becoming silly."
1,Highly edited version,"There is a notice at the beginning that this version has been edited. I didn't expect it to be edited this much. Lot's of language, etc.If we are authenticated by age and we are purchasing this stuff I don't want the G-rated version! C'mon showtime!!!!!"
2,dexter season 4,"I like the series, but the picture quality of this dvd was bad. I expected high definition picture which this was not."
1,Picture quality.,While playing it becomes very pixelated. The picture quality was not great. Plus it was full screen. Said it was wide screen.
2,Dexter Season 4,"Disc two and disc four were duplicate discs. While it was marked ""Disc 2"", the content was actually that of Disc 4. A BIG DISAPOINTMENT!"
5,Love it.,Dexter is by far one of the best series on TV. I just can not get enough of it. Outstanding
3,the weakest season but still good,"After watching all the seasons, I would say this one is the slowest-moving of them all. But compared to most of the other shows on TV, even the slowest season of Dexter is better than most other shows by far. And Miami in HD is gorgeous!"
5,Love this guy,"It may not be for everybody. But if you have a sense of humor that is slightly askew, and if you're bored with the ordinary it's a really good time."
4,"Great, Innovative Series","My girlfriend introduced me to Dexter, and I'm not complaining! Sure, Dexter's obsession is being a serial killer, but we all have obsessions. Dexter does a great job of portraying a person and how they balance their life with their addictions. I have seen every episode of Dexter and it is great. The great writing and acting is evident. This show has a great cast and you immediately care about the characters. Michael Hall and Jennifer Carpenter are great and they really hold their own in season four. It is no wonder they are married in real life. This season is a little disturbing than the other seasons, which I LOVE. I am extremely anticipating what season five has to offer. Let's hope season five is not the last."
4,Interesting continuation of the plot,"A bit sad how desparately Dex tries season after season to learn from other serial killers how to handle family life, but still suspensefull and interesting. Not as riviting as the first 3 seasons, but if you've seen them and are a fan you don't want to miss this one."
5,WOW!,"I was so about the give up on Dexter, but this season turned around and this episode made me wanting more! WOW is all I can say - can't wait for next season! Darn Netflix put this one episode on one disc (I guess not Netflix...more like Showtime, but whatever!), and because I was too impatient to wait one whole day for it to come in the mail, I got it on Amazon. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Best season yet!!!,"This was by far the best season of Dexter and John Lithgow played a fantastic role!It is extremely creepy, but brilliant and there are so many twist and turns in the season you won't get bored!But i should warn you, you probably won't leave the house for the entire day because you will be watching episode after episode!! It is not only the best, but also the most addictive season!!!Highly recommend getting it if you haven't seen it already!Even if you have seen it, i would still get it!! I know i'm getting it :)"
4,who does not love Dexter?!,"My family and I are big Dexter fans! I could not wait for the next disc to arrive from Netflix so my boyfriend and I purchased an episode on Amazon on a Friday night. The quality was good and the ease of access while sitting on our couch was quite appealing. However, I wish the episodes were cheaper!"
3,Time to end this.,Enough already. They need to call it quits. This season the implausibility of the whole thing just came to a head.
2,"Loved the First 3 Seasons, Hated This One","I am a huge fan of the first 3 seasons, but I'm really disappointed in this last one. I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this season, but I can boil it down to this. Seasons 1-3 were masterpieces in dark humor. In season 4, the humor is gone and only darkness remains. I won't spoil it for you, but I also hated the last minutes of the last episode: seriously depressing."
5,Undeniably Hooked,"The Season 4 finale was outstanding. I was getting tired of all the ""domesticity"" being foisted on Dexter and Rita was starting to really annoy me. Am a long-time admirer of John Lithgow and he did an outstanding job. What's up with Dexter's hair -- at times he looked like he was wearing a wig, and not a very good one. Particularly enjoyed the episode with Zoey Kruger. A more detailed story line revolving around a female serial killer would be a good plot idea for Season 5. Quinn is no Doakes but he also could prove interesting for Season 5. Debra's involvement with Antoinne was a low point for her character. Could we have one season where Debra keeps her pants on? I say less focus on the stupid kids (Astor, Cody and Harrison). Dexter needs to concentrate on building his slide collection, which made Season 1 so diverse and entertaining, and totally hooked me on this unique and excellent series. Your writers are terrific!"
2,Forced Failed Marriage. Again.,"Trinity makes for a sicko, which is great and adds suspense. Deb is charismatic and excellent. Dexter is Dexter, and Michael Hall continues his supreme excellence.My trouble sits with two issues. For one, not nearly enough bad-guy killing, and it's not even so Dexter can find himself this time.The main issue I have is with the whole Rita fighting with Dexter. It feels like the producers are trying to force their marriage to fall apart. The arguments are weak, the conflict feels forced, and it's just stupid.Honestly, I stopped watching it after four episodes because the acting on Julie Benz's was not convincing at all.Also, the Batista x LaGuerta thing is annoying, but the former does a decent job with making it feel important.All in all, the romance sucks and lacks emotion, and there's not even any action to make up for it. Just... lots and lots and lots of crappy romance."
3,Great show but disappointing DVDs,"Dexter is right up there at the top with any series in my opinion. But the DVDs are a disappointment. I've ordered two seasons, including this one, and there is no option for captions, always a convenience. In addition, there are no extras. Well, that isn't completely true. There are preview episodes of other Showtime series--but that's pretty much it! And I find that a little frustrating. The point was driven home to me when I received ""The Good Wife."" In that there were included numerous interviews, commentaries, as well as deleted scenes--with commentaries about them! Personally, I think that Dexter is on a par as a quality show--but the DVDs don't measure up!"
3,Service,"I ordered a dvd, it arrived in record time I was very impress. However the 1 disc was loose in the cover & scratched so much it is impossible to watch it, contacted the company & did not receive any response."
3,Least favorite season so far,"Abit surprised after all the hype that this is my least favorite season of the four I have seen. Very rushed, sloppy, out of nowhere and annoying relationships, way too many give me a break moments. Even with a great cast the script is just painful and dexter is so off his game even for a season trying to justify that by his new life. The forced filler and prolonged confrontation just isn't believable, its like they knew they wanted an outrageous ending but couldn't figure out how to get there. I blind buy these season sets but I may rent S5 I am very leery now."
5,It just keeps getting better!,"A friend suggested this series to me and I tried it. After the first episode I thought why the heck did I take his advice on this one? But by the end of the second episode I was hooked.While Dexter is in fact a serial killer, this show is about far more then the killing he does, In fact that is really for the most part a side note. There is a lot of character development and the writing is great. These are clever stories that leave you eagerly looking forward to the next. I've seen all four seasons now and I can't wait for season five to become available.Dexter's story is a complex one and he struggles with what brought him to where he is. This show has a great cast who you come to care about pretty quickly.You'll have to deal with strong language as well as the killings. But, if you can deal with the world as it actually is then you'll love Dexter."
5,Best Show on TV,"Season 4 kicks it up a notch with special guest John Lithgow. Best season since season one. This is probably my favorite show of all time and it continues to grow and evolve in surprising ways. It you like dark and twisted drama with some comedic elements, this is the show for you."
1,Apallingly bad TV,"Don't watch this - Dexter series 4 is a total waste of time and will leave you infuriated and unsatisfied! The ending is really bad, but it never actually gets any good. I loved the first 2 series but wow they went completely off the tracks here and series 3 isn't much better. Be warned!!!"
2,It's finally jumped the shark,"I've loved the first three seasons. I've never been so riveted by a television program. When I heard that Jon Lithgow was joining the cast I became nervous; bringing on a well-known actor is a classic sign of jumping the shark. The producers hoped to reinvigorate the brand by bringing in outside help. If that was all they had done, the season would have been bearable, bland, but bearable.Instead, the show commits a mortal sin--it destroys its winning formula in a desperate attempt to win viewers for the next season. It won't work. The series is doomed. It really is too bad they couldn't resist the urge to milk this cow to death.The real show ended in season 3. If you want to remember Dexter as a great show, walk away at the end of season three. Not only will season four be less enjoyable that the previous three, its needlessly harsh ""shocker"" ending will make you like the previous seasons less.Just walk away. Watch something else."
1,Failure of Disc 3 (again),"I've enjoyed the series immensely, and was on to the final disc of this set, but the last disc simply will not load/play. It hangs on a black screen and does not progress further.This was purchased last week (8/17) and the replacement was delivered today (8/25)This is the second attempt (this is a replacement from Amazon), but this copy has the same issues as the first set. I've seen plenty of customers that have enjoyed this season, and only a couple dealing with this defect (from both Amazon and Netflix). I suspect this defect is related to this current batch, but that still leaves me unable to finish the series.If you purchase it and find the same problem with the last disc, it means you received one from the same defective batch.I'll wait and try again later."
1,There is a reason why this show was banned!,"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Show! And yes from cable TV this series was banned for many reasons and both CBS Showtime's sister network would also be reprimanded if this show ever aired prime time on other channels! The main character is so disgusting and despicable its not even worth talking or writing about. You want a good show check out Rescue Me, or House, or heck even old sci-fi series like the Invisible Man and Star Trek are leaps and bounds better than this garbage!"
4,Dexter is the ultimate good guy/bad guy,Have enjoyed this series from the start! Great writing and well acted. Might be starting to loose its edge a little as it goes into more people(his sister) knowing what he is and what he is doing.
5,LOVE THIS SERIES!,I LOVE Dexter and this season is in good shape and turned out nicely. I would recommend everyone to watch this series!
5,One of the more clever shows on TV,"This show is responsible for me to taking the plunge and forking over the extra money for Show Time. I barely watch enough TV to justify having basic cable.Dexter however, is one of the most intelligent shows on TV. Which made me worried that they were going to cancel it. It seems that whenever a clever, quirky, thought provoking show manages to slip through the cracks it is eventually caught and sent to an early grave.Let's hope for at least a few more seasons.Excellent writing, clever dialog, indepth character develop, great story development, visually pleasing to watch. Michael Hall is brilliant in this role. I was surprised about the casting, but not after seeing the first episode. He was very good as David in Six Feet Under, however, Dexter really let's him show his full range of talent."
4,"A good, solid 4th season","**Spoiler alert if you've not watched seasons 1-3 already!**While season 4 continues the trend of great acting (great being an understatement in some scenes), directing and atmosphere, John Lithow's character wasn't as worthy an adversary as the Ice Truck Killer in season 1, Doakes/Lundy in season 2 or Miguel Prada in season 3. While Lithgow's acting is top notch, the character itself doesn't help bring out new qualities in Dexter and should've been relegated to a minor part rather than expanded into a major role over 12 episodes.Still, that's really only a blemish on an otherwise solid season and the last two episodes are truly amazing, incredibly in the spirit of the show and will leave you in a whirlwind of anticipation for season 5.In short, if you like Dexter stop wasting your time reading reviews and just buy the season already! =)"
5,Awsome!,"The best one yet! John Lithgow was perfect for this part. It was so hard not to read or talk about this season before I received the DVDs...I'm glad I didn't. One season in two nights. I'm tired, but it was so worth it.Thax, Dex."
4,Great set - Disc 2 would not work in my blueray - all others are fine,Great set arrived without any problems. We're happy with it other than the problem with disc #2. Fortunately we have both a standard and blueray player and were able to watch disc #2 on our standard machine. If you are curious - we did try cleaning both the disc and blue ray - but it didn't correct the problem.
5,very satisfied customer,"The forth season is a real thriller.. Love Dex. The cliff-hanger is a doozy. Hated it to end.. Can't wait for 5. This site is amazing. Amazon is truly a one stop shop for many items. They have speedy shipping, which I am always surprised when my items arrive before I think they will and the cataloge is so informative, that it takes the guess work out of wondering what the item details. I'm very pleased to have this site is available to me, when I'm trying to find an specific item. I know if it's on Amazon, I won't be disappointed.."
1,Cannot skip previews at beginning of Bluray version,"First of all, Dexter is a great show, don't get me wrong. This season, in fact, is worth a five star review for the excellent plot lines, suspense and execution. The blu-ray also has wonderful picture quality so good you can easily tell some of the scenes that are green screen. The audio is also excellent.HOWEVER, the Bluray version of this season FORCES you to watch a 10 minute advertisement every time you put in a disk! I already know about the other shows on Showtime, I don't need to be reminded. When I set aside an hour to watch an episode, I don't want to waste 10 minutes of my time waiting for the menu to load. Showtime/Paramount evidently does not value their consumers' time.I recommend NOT buying the blu-ray version of this product because of the horrible forced advertising at the beginning of each disk."
2,"Dexter is becoming ""unbelievable.""","Okay, first a Dexter watcher has to accept the premise of the show. But within the parameters set by the writers, there is no way Rita would accept Dexter being gone so much--not with the previous admission of drug use. Sorry, but this glaring flaw combined with the ridiculous coincidences in the Trinity case, I fear Dexter is becoming silly."
3,it's gotten too dark for me,"I very much enjoyed the 1st three seasons - it quickly became my favorite show. However, this season took a turn for the worse. Previously, Dexter was able to keep his habit from causing discomfort for the audience by the type of persons he took down, and he was able to keep his personal life separated from his late-night activities. Now with the complications in his life (marriage, cohabitation, kids), the writers were unable to maintain that. If they ever go the way the books have gone, I will totally quit the show. As it is, this season dropped me to a casual viewer rather than a dedicated one."
1,Not all Episodes Played Properly,"I bought this product based on price and saved it to watch for when I was on my Christmas vacation (as I already own the first 3 seasons on DVD), and I regret that decision - the season was shot digitally, which is fine when the transfer is done correctly, but the 4th episode (disk 2) was barely watchable in that the pixels were so far off it was all I could do to get through the episode, and episode 5 was not as bad but was also poor quality - I will probably end up buying it again from a local retailer where it is easy to return if it doesn't play right."
5,Wonder what this says about me,That I should so thoroughly enjoy such delicious salacious murderous thoughts? Hmmm. Now I just gotta get the Cd player hooked up to the too big cant wrap your arms around tv set taking over the finest corner of my living room.
3,"love the show,hate the digital transfer?","like the title says,i am a big fan so of course i love the material.this review concerns the digital tranfer.WTF HAPPENED? granted on some scenes there is a mosaic pattern done as an effect now and then but my eyes see a ton of digital motion artifacts throughout.i have an interlaced rear projection tv.i would imagine a better tv would be even more obvious.visible in the skintone areas and broad fields of color mostly.shows up as vertical lines when the characters are in motion.also occasionaly there is the screen door type of mosaic pattern artifact.my advise is get the blue ray,cross your fingers and hope it's better."
5,Lithgow is Amazing,"Lithgow as Trinity Killer is just amazing. Hall is in great form and really starts to live and breathe the character. The only neg about this season is Dexter's wife, Rita. She's beautiful and sweet...but there's something annoying about her. She seems to judge without actually saying anything, nag without really nagging. It's hard to explain but I know I'm not the only one who found her annoying. In fact, the writers do take care of this problem in the end..."
5,Dexter is awesome and addictive.,Dexter is a great TV series full of twist and turns. Excellent story lines that keeps you on edge and wanting more. Loved every season and every episode.
2,The weakest season yet,This is by far the weakest season of the Dexter series. The John Lithgow character is predictable and uninteresting and Dexter's interminable musings about family life are boring. The romance between two police officers adds nothing to the plot and Dexter's sister is annoying as ever. The only redeeming feature of this season is that finally we're rid of the world's dumbest woman.
2,"good show, bad quality video","It was supposed to be HD, but the video quality was intermittently good and then got pixely/grainy and skipped a few seconds... would be better if amazon got the quality right..."
5,Excellent Book & Good Price too!,"This book is awesome! It is exactly what I was looking for, and at the local book stores it is $20."
1,Utterly Brutal,"Since I'm fan of watching superhero movies even if they are corny, this movie however is utterly brutal, almost too painful to watch. My hat goes off to the creators, cast and crew for making this for us.Not really."
5,sky high for a younger audience,In this movie Im alen must led a new band of super hero kids between the age of 6 and 17. Can they defeat tim alone brother concusion after he betrayed his team after me exposed to Gama thirteen and killed all of them zoom played by tim alen. Can they new zenith team stop Concusion from threatening the world again. Find out in the heroic thrilling conclusion
3,"Nothing special, but still okay","If burnt-out father figures are your cup of tea, if you find ten year-olds throwing buses around hilarious, then you'll love this movie. I did enjoy watching it, and every now and again when the mood hits me I do pull it out and watch it again, but there is nothing here that really catches my funny bone or appeals to my sense of the dramatic.Never my first choice, but still a good one to have in my library."
3,No putdown intended,"Okay, I have great grandchildren and they felt that this movie was the bomb, whatever that means. I, on the other hand could have done ok without it."
3,Zoom - Academy for Superheroes,funny- but did have some slow parts. Great movie for kids younger than 14 Tim Allen looks great.
1,"Yes, it's an X-Men Rip-off.....","Forget about the fact that this is a brainless movie with no jokes, no casting, and no script.If you are an X-Men Fan, then you will not like this clear slap in the face to that comic book, it also did not sit well with either 20th Century Fox or Marvel as they successfully sued to have the script changed."
1,Not Good Enough!,"What can I say, other than this movie is DIRT POOR?Trust me when I say this, it's not even worth renting...what a waste. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD...DON'T EVEN RENT IT...YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!"
1,Have a lame idea?....then make a movie.,"One thing that bugged me was why were children chosen to fight Concussion? Can acting get anymore uninspired? Boring script and superheroes with redundant powers (telekinesis, strength, invisibility)...no originality. Special effects were good in some areas and bad in others. Plot was mediocre. I would avoid this film, unless you want to add another to your list of bad movies. I bet Courtney loved Tim Allen's fast finger."
5,just for the kids,"just bought it for the kids, great kids movie,jhgfjufg gfjhtgfj tfjytf hgfdhtf ghfhjtf hgfhtf hgfhyjtf gfhf gvf fvvvgvyhg gggfv ,."
4,Great movie for kids,"This is a funny movie, but not really intended for adults. My 3 year old loves this movie and watches it all the time. We showed it to the daycare he goes to and all of the kids 2-6 love the movie. I would recommend this to a younger crowd."
4,fun movie,"This is a fun - superhero movie. It has got soon to be superheroes from ages 6 years to 17; so this is a fun movie for the whole family. And, of course Tim Allen is always worth a watch."
2,Watch Sky High instead....,"Thankfully rented for free from the library, we watched Zoom last night and found it falls rather flat for all audience levels. A poor knock off ofSky High (Widescreen Edition), it may have been meant for a younger audience - like under 6. The only bright spots are the actors who were limited by the poor script and special effects. If you like booger humor than maybe you can get through this one....rent Sky High instead!"
4,"There's no middle ground for this movie, is there?","This seems to be a real love it or hate it movie. To everyone who hasn't weighed in, let me give you a few words of advice. If you're looking for a deep plot, a profound message, or award-winning characterization--don't bother because it's not here. However, if you're looking for a silly, shiny popcorn flick that you can spend a little time laughing at and you're willing to let go of any lurking high standards enough to enjoy it, then you're in the right place. Also, as I believe other reviewers have mentioned, this is a kid-targeted and kid-friendly film."
3,Re-Using Old Ideas?,"I guess that is expected if you did an album in only three weeks, but I still expected more from Beyonce. ""Deja Vu"" is basically ""Crazy In Love"" pt.2 and yet it lacks the creativity of ""Crazy In Love"". This has not stop the song from going number one and it will not stop her album from going number one. However, it is time for her work to mature with her. While the track is hot, the fact she has already released a second song should tell you this song will not be considered a 'classic'."
5,Great Interpretation from Heidi Skok,"I really love this cycle by Ned Rorem, and any fan of 20th century american art song will like it as well I should imagine. Heidi Skok has an AMAZING voice, it is rich like chocolate and so emotive. Her high notes soar and still have the depth of her low and mid-voice. Martin Hennessy does a great job accompanying. This is seriously difficult music and they manage to make it sound rather effortless.I'm not quite sure yet what to think of the songs composed by Martin Hennessy--he certainly writes beautiful music, but it does not have the character that Rorem's compositions have. Also, he has certain whispered sections in ""In the Stillness"" which could not be performed live because of balance issues. Still they are enjoyable, my personal favorite being ""Sonnet for Micheal"" with text by Edna St Vincent Millay.If you are either a fan of Rorem's or simply of 20th Century american art song, this is an essential recording. I am eternally glad that I own it."
5,great bargain!,"I took this tent on a week long mule pack trip to Thousand Island Lake near Mammoth's devil's postpile. It rained almost daily and hailed two of the days. I did seal the seams before and made a footprint out of tyvek. This tent stayed dry inside despite thunderstorms. I found it on sale for $80 so it's a lot cheaper than other tents. Quality is great. it has little pockets inside that are useful for putting little stuff inside like my iphone or headlamp. I am 5 feet tall and use a women's sleeping bag and pad that are about 5'6"". This tent has enough room in the head for my backpack, the sides have enough room for my clothes and other stuff. the vestibule is small and barely fits my shoes. if i were 6 feet tall, i'd get a small 2 person tent. for a petite woman like me, this tent has more than enough room for a weeklong backcountry trip. it is very lightweight and only weighs a little over 3 lbs but doesn't feel too flimsy or weak."
4,Awesome tent for the ultralight backpacker!,This tent weighs less than 3 lbs and does exactly what it's intended to do. The set-up is very easy and Eureka makes a great product.
4,Love it!,"Light, Small when rolled up, big enough for me (6' 1"" 230lbs). vestibule is small but would work for shoes and maybe a pack if you had to. plenty of room for misc stuff at your feet, and honestly could sleep two people if you absolutely had to. Easy to sit straight up in. Easy to pitch and tear down, and best part easy to get to a reasonable size after taking it down (unlike other tents I have experienced) Floor material feels a little thing, but With a ground cloth I wasn't worried. Kinda hard to not get a little wet when getting out if it in the morning with the rain fly up ( I think that goes for most)."
5,Eureka Spitfire - Great Value,"This tent performed admirably on its maiden voyage, a week in the North Cascades. Lightweight as advertised, easy to set up, comfortable (I'm five-nine and there was plenty of room to spare), and waterproof. Read the manual: I took their seam sealing advice and it payed off during a couple very rainy days. They also have some good guyline advice that I haven't put to the test yet. Others have advised replacing the stakes. Buy a groundcloth or make your own.The only caveats so far: Be gentle with the fly zipper, and make sure you realize this is a staked tent, not one you can pop up and relocate prior to staking.Overall a really good tent at a really low price."
4,spifire,"great tent ,had an issue one night with the zipper at a year and it self destructed :( good tent not so good zippers"
4,Quick learning curve and easy setup,"I needed a 3 season tent for a climb on Mount Mitchell recently. The tent arrived 2 days before I needed it so I didn't have a lot of time to figure it out. I unpacked it, set it up in 20 minutes without a problem. The tent was easy to add to my pack and worked out great on the mountain. There was plenty of room for my gear in and around the tent (I left my climbing poles under the flap but outside the tent itself). Repacking after the night was quick and painless so getting going was easy. I can't wait to use it again."
5,"Amazing, Probably the best back country purchase I've ever made.","I bought this tent in 2006. I've used it for the last 6 years heavily. I've probably put around 500+ miles on this tent and I can honestly say it's one of if not ""the one"" best pieces of gear I've ever bought. It's light weight, compact and warm. It has such a tall floor 'rim' that raises 6-8"" up the sides which helps to trap the heat since the fly can be tightened down to just an inch or so off the ground. There are lighter one-man's but not by much with a full fly and enclosed tent. The cost difference is extreme for the 6-8Oz you might save IMHO and this tent has durability. I can't say enough about this awesome tent."
5,Just all around good tent for the price!,"I have just beat this poor tent up beyond what it was meant for and it just still keeps coming back and asking for more...hee..eh. Poor thing I've rolled it up in a ball after a bad storm which I stayed dry [I did seal the seams though] and let it sit for several days. It started to mold so I thought, why not put it in the washer...darn thing came out with a smile. I air dried it out and resealed the seams and it has just come right back to life. I'm using this tent as a training tent for an Appalachian Trail Thru hike if it keeps performing this good I may just take it with me! I'm 6'2"" 210 lb. and this tent still has some room for odds and ends all scattered around the tent. Condensation will plague just about every tent but this managed to hold it off pretty good. Great tent for the price! If I just ""had"" to find something bad about it I would say it doesn't set itself up. Haa!"
5,Great LITTLE tent,"First off, this tent is small. I'm just under 6' and while I can sleep in it and sit up comfortably, it's too small to also fit my pack.It goes up pretty easily if you read the instructions and perform the steps in the right sequence. Like any tent, you'd be prudent to actually erect it prior to getting into the backcountry - though planning ahead never was my strong point.As others have pointed out, the stakes it comes with are relatively heavy. I replaced mine with Titanium stakes - they aren't a whole lot lighter the Aluminum ones, but they are an awful lot thinner and are easier to push in."
1,"batteries missing, added junk in the shipment, will call company for complaint process","I received the batteries...one package was 10.00 for 4 little batteries, I am in the process of reviewing my order. To top it off, when I opened the box, there is an individual box of breakfast cereal added in the box???? It had been partially crushed and opened, spilling out the contents. It looks like whoever put this shipment together must belong to the rat family. I also believe parts of my order are missing (since I never received any more batteries) It was the triple aaa battery...I only received half of them."
3,Great value for money!,"These kayaks are now available in Australia...great! I use mine at the beach and find it very stable.Great in choppy seas where the kayak 'gives' with the waves. However, it is very light on the water and the slightest breeze will put it of course! Not especially ideal for children, as the kayak could be easily swept away. Disadvantages are that (1) the canvas is not very tough and (2) the paddle blades are not very robust. I'll be replacing my paddles with a stonger pair. Other than that, great value for money and much admired by other beach goers!"
4,Can not beat it for the money!!!,"Our family purchased three, one-man kayak's. They were great! We wanted something cheap, easy to cart around, and fun enough to get the daughter away from the TV. All three were accomplished! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the oar assembly instructions. Not being a water rat like my husband, it took me a little longer to figure it out. The instructions are useless. Use your logic and they go together in a snap. All tightening fittings screw tight to the ridged areas on the poles, poles slip together under the grips to keep them water tight (thus bouyant), oars go on the capped pole ends, once again keeping the water out and the air in. Hope that helps somebody. They are worth the money!"
4,Coleman Inflatable Kayak,"This kayak is very well made, following the directions I had no trouble putting the paddle together. On a lake I was very pleased with how easily it gilded over the water. I hope to purchase another in the spring so I can kayak with my son. This is not the top of the line kayak, but it will do just fine for me!"
3,A Beginner Takes to the Waters,"This is a fun, convenient kayak for a beginner. How can you go wrong for $59? I bought a PDF and the Coleman Dual-Action QuickPump ($10) to go with it, stuck everything on the back seat of my compact car, and headed for the C&O Canal. The kayak inflated in only a few minutes, to the great interest of bystanders, and off I went. The kayak is very stable and comfortable, and much easier to handle than a rowboat. I followed some ducks down the canal, and when it was time to come home, I pulled it up to the bank, stepped out, and used the QuickPump to deflate it (again, to great interest). A little exercise and lots of fun!"
4,Worth the money and lots of fun,"This inflatable kayak is worth the money it costs, but don't expect more. It is a fun way to paddle around calm bodies of water for short periods. I have kayaked touring kayaks on multi-day camping trips with portages, but don't have the time to do that anymore and did not want to spend $500 or more for a decent ""real"" kayak. This kayak will fill my desires for some short paddles in nice weather. I've taken it out in large tidal waters and even beyond the ocean surf and had a very good time.The kayak is surprisingly stable because of its beam, but this beam (especially above-water) makes it susceptible to winds. It is also faster than I thought it would be. The paddle is a bit light and small, and I'll probably buy a larger paddle. But there is enough fun to be had in this kayak to make it worth its modest price."
5,~Bread For Life ~ |Thomas' New York Style Bagels|,"MM's Review: I enjoy these bagels as one of the most delicious -ly important source of protein in my daily meal plan. If possible, I like to have at least 2 to 3 servings per day. These plain bagels are low in sodium, fat without adding any toppings and not too bad for the gluten- intolerant person. One of the blueberry bagel is sweet enough by itself for a natural carbohydrate treat! There are nutritional and life sustaining value when one has a consumable meal or snack of this yummy and worthy bread for life to satisfy one's hunger. Thank you to the baker's of these tasty bagel's."
1,Bagel shaped bread,Thomas' makes incredible English Muffins. The people who designed their bagels have never had bagels. Thomas' Bagels are Bagel shaped bread. There is nothing bagel about it.
5,Excellent overview,"This book gives an excellent overview on light scattering by small particles and is a must-have for everybody working on scattering phenomena. Whether you are a phycisist, mathematician or engineer, it provides a solid basis for the problems encountered. Further comment is not needed - just consider how often this book is referenced to in scientific publications!"
3,So..so,"okay, this book is highly utilized by a great deal of people in the field, but i find the book lacking in readability. It generalizes far too much. It gives too little detail. It reminds me of an outline for a scattering text book. It is a reference text in the truest sense of the word. It's obvious intent is a reminder for those who already know the information, but it is so generalized...it alone is not very useful for the student learning scattering."
5,"If you can find it, it's worth it","Brian Froud does it again with this beautifully illustrated book. This book is centered around goblins (rather than faeries). Still good, but sometimes hard to find. Good luck tracking it down, Froud fans! You won't regret it!"
4,great graphics,I already had this book but bought another as a gift for a friend. I was a little disappointed that the book was much smaller than the version I already had. But the quality was as good as new.
1,Clearly a pro-Muslim book,"I have read all the chapters dealing with religion in this book very closely. While it may seem that there is nothing wrong with the book by browsing through it, taking a closer look at the text shows that the book pretty much promotes Islam while very clearly putting down Christianity."
1,Not Happy with Amazon,"My wife needs this product for a medical condition.It was ordered on December 4, 2008 for delivery in 7 to 10 days.It is now January 6, 2009. Still no delivery!We were forced to seek another source for the productand will not be ordering anything from Amazon in the future.James StanislawskiGreenfield, Wisconsin"
3,Kickstand for heavy bicycles.,"This is a rather odd kickstand. It tucks up both legs on the left side of your bike. It worked well to steady my motorized bike and is reasonably strong but still lightweight. However, it is a bit fussy to operate and takes extra effort to employ. I have replaced it with an easy-to-use low hanging double stand, but am thinking of going back to the Esge/SKS stand because it parks completely out of the way.All-in-all it is well designed and built but a bit quirky. BTW, it mounts in the usual place in the middle of your bike."
3,Not what I expected,"Didn't realize from the description that it was a pocket size and as small as it was. Also, I used it for a translation test and not many words were in the dictionary. Not very impressed."
2,"Interesting topic, not an interesting book",I have started to read this book on at least four occasions. I force myself to read it for a few nights and a row and then I end up setting it aside. I've owned the book for a year and a half and am not even to the half way point. I find the author tries to incorporate many experts opinions but it is in a scattered sort of fashion. The author does not have a very succinct fashion of writing. A chapter that's five pages contains information that could have been contained on two pages. Overall a very dry read.
1,How to make mid-century modern a bore.,"Really, this is an exciting style, but you'd never know it from this magazine! Is the the refusal to add any other style that makesit so stagnant?"
5,don't subscribe here,"I was very excited to subscribe to this magazine through the convenience of Amazon. Because I wouldn't get my first issue till the fall, I went to Borders and got the summer issue. To my absolute SHOCK, the subscription card from the magazine said ""one year only $19.99"" (over a $14 difference than Amazon). You can not cancel a subscription with Amazon, and they have not responded to my complaints of the pricing difference. It's a great magazine, but go to your local book store. It's going to be a while before I order anything from Amazon again!"
2,OK but poor customer service,"I liked the magazine, being an owner in a neighborhood that 2 consecutive issues featured homes from was interesting, however, they did not fulfill our subscription, and when we brought this up to them via email they blamed us and the post office for not receiving it, they sent them out 2 months prior to us moving here, but they blamed us for not providing a new address, even though we had only been here 2 weeks when we contacted them. very rude and they never not once said, 'let us check our records"", just a ""we won't send another"" end of chat. Very brassy for a start-up magazine. I am done with them"
5,A Magazine that I love being a subscriber to,I have had great customer service with this magazine and have loved getting every issue and reading it from cover to cover. When I called to subscribe to Atomic Ranch one of its employees even asked me questions regarding my own ranch home and suggested that I send pictures in for someone in their staff to review. I strongly recommend this magazine to anyone who loves mid-century modern homes and decor.
3,Atomic Ranch,The recipient requiested the magazines. I am assuming they will like them as that was the person's request. I have never come across the magazines. Atomic Ranch
4,"""fanzine turning pro"" is an apt description","I have been a subscriber for years, since issue #2 I think. This magazine has improved tremendously since then, although some of the layout and typography are still a tad amateur. It has the feeling of a fanzine transitioning to ""pro"".The emphasis is on ""real people's homes"" as opposed to heavily-staged, high-end photoshoots like you would see in Modernism magazine or others. This is not to say that these are completely candid snaps with dirty laundry stacked in the corner, they are obviously staged somewhat, but there is a fair amount of homey-kitsch-factor. The houses often have thrift store finds and kitschy stuff intertwined with their DWR purchases. These are the retro-fans who dig prints by Shag, if you know what i mean.All in all, it's a nice companion magazine if you also read Modernism and Dwell. Combined, they cover most of the spectrum. But don't get it through Amazon. Find the atomic ranch website and get it there."
5,Cooling System And Pressure Cap Tester,This unit worked exactly as intended. It enabled me to diagnose a problem with reasonable certainty before I took a car in for repair.
3,Radiator pressure tester,It works fine for the average domestic car but the attachments for the new and foreign cars are very pricey .You can get a different brand with all the attachments included for a comparable price. I think I paid for the stant name
5,The primer for paranormal research,"No other single book in print will give the beginning paranormal researcher a better overall view of the field. Also can be an eye opener for the experienced hand who has only read the ""specialty"" titles of recent years. The companion titles ""Stranger than Science"" and ""Strangest of All"" will complete a thorough overview of the subject"
3,Another Fun Collection of the Strange,"This is the sequel to Edwards'Stranger Than Sciencewhere he collects more stories of the unusual. This book comes from the era of popolarity of these kinds of books before they were sent out of the mainstream press and banished to fringe publishers. I haven't attempted to verify the stories within, and occasionally you may think of possible explanations, but there is still much to leave you wondering. Can they all really be frauds all minsunderstandings? Sure, the UFO stories are nostalgic from the era of UFOs everywhere, though now, decades later, the hope of UFO Fundies is dying out (seeRoswell and the Reich,Lights in the Sky & Little Green Men,Hitler's Flying Saucers). In an era where people are buried in their smartphones and have no idea of what is going on around them, Edwards' books from another time will make you pause and think about what else may be to the world."
3,Everyone Loves a Strange Tale,"I loved this book when I was a kid. I had the whole Frank Edwards series of ""strange"" books: Strange World,Strange People,Stranger Than Science,STRANGEST OF ALL. They were all greatly entertaining, all put out by science-fiction publisher Ace Paperbacks, and sold at drugstores everywhere. Those were the days (a trite and meaningless comment, but it seems to belong here).But then (alas) I grew up.To a grown-up, the trouble with this pulp ""gee-whiz"" genre is that, without cited sources, the stories lead nowhere. The episodes are presented to the reader on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, with no clues as to where to look for verification or further investigation. True? False? Exaggerated? Who can tell? Anyone looking for more than entertaining strange stories must look elsewhere."
4,Good cost-benefit ratio,Do not expect this book to be a Ten day MBA. It does very good for its value but only cites the main tools taught at MBA schools. It is very good to give you an idea of what an MBA program is all about.
5,Talk the talk MBA-style,"I just read the 320 page book in 4 days because I wanted to quickly know the knowledge base of the typical MBA. Mission accomplished! Now I can talk about NPV (Net-present value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return) and so many other MBA concepts. I can't calculate these things but at least I know they exist. Most importantly, I now have a complete understanding of the many parts of a business.I highly recommend the book. The author has a clear style."
5,Must-have reading for business!,"This book should be required reading for anyone interested in business. For MBA students, I imagine each chapter would serve as a great primer for each course subject, especially from a big picture perspective. For non-MBA students (such as myself), Silbiger provides a highly educational and entertaining description of the basics of business. Highly recommended!"
3,Pretty decent reference,"I have this book on my bookshelf, and I've used it as reference once in a while. Not the best in terms of quality, but for basics of what we learn in business school or a quick refresher on some of the concepts not bad. You'll definitely find better stuff with research on internet but it's not bad if you need to quickly check something."
3,"Ok, but this is basic stuff","I thought I would be getting a jump on my future courses by picking up this book. Unfortunately, the material covered in the Economics and Accounting segments I already knew AND I CURRENTLY ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I am guessing the other chapters will give me a nice advantage on my UNDERGRADUATE work in the other topics such as finance, marketing, management, and quants. If you think you will have MBA knowledge after this read, you won't. The locol college will teach all this."
3,An after-the-fact,"I think this book is better for those people who have completed the MBA or in the middle of it to read as a refresher. It simplified a lot what you learned in the classes. However, I still do not think by reading this book alone will give you all the knowledge that an MBA has. Otherwise, everybody should just buy this book and forget about attending the school...."
2,"If you have an MBA: OK, otherwise: skip it","I bought this book before I embarked on my MBA. I tried and tried to make sense of it, no luck (I may be imbecille, but I don't think so). It manages to skip over introductary materials, fails to explains the importance of different topics, have a focus on accounting and is in my opinion extremely boring to read.After having re-read it recently, I believe it is an excellent refresher for many MBA topics and refreshingly witty, but as a starter book: no. As to living up to its title: get real, this wont accomplish you getting nearer an MBA or even getting the hang of the jargon. Buy Gorman's CIGt MBA Basics if you need to learn some jargon."
2,Tough Read,This book was a tough read. It lost me in the first few chapters and too much was written about the author and his struggle than about a step by step guide for an MBA. I did not personally find it useful and decided that researching this was easier from other publications and online resources.
3,Excellent,"My husband was very interested in finding this book, unfortunately we were unable to locate a copy in any bookstores in Victoria, so as usual, we tried Amazon and succeeded immediately. Many thanks to all your staff for a wonderful job."
4,the joy of living,"i am a healthcare provider. For me this book offered a link between the spiritual and physical worlds. it demystifies meditation making it more ""accessible"" to everyone."
5,Very inspiration,This book taught me a totally different way to meditate that is easy and can be done anywhere. With this kind of meditation you find peace in a few moments of practice and reap loads of benefit. Peace be with you even if it is only for 30 seconds.
5,"a ""must have"" book for practicing buddhist and non buddhist alike.",a must have for buddhist and non-buddhist alike. practical instruction and teachings written for a western audience by a Lama with an impeccable lineage. authentic. simple and powerful. guaranteed to become a favorite book in your collection.
3,"Clear mids and highs, not good for bass.","These sounded pretty good when I first got them and put them in the doors of my wifes 98 mazda protege (along with 6x9 Pioneers in the rear deck, all powered by a Pioneer receiver). But once I switched them along with receiver to my new car , a dodge challenger (where the rear deck has the 6.5's and the doors are 6x9), they sounded like crap. Somehow, at the exact same volume, the bass now clips very badly, even if I put 90% of the volume to the 6x9 speakers.These sound okay, but I recommend bass blockers to keep these from clipping and relying on your other speakers for bass. (btw, the 6x9 Pioneers that match these still sound great and the bass on those is chest-pounding)"
4,Good for the price,"I have a 99 Mitsubishi Galant My front speakers were blown(factory) After installing these speakers. New life has now been brought back to my car. I'm not a speakerphile so the technical jargon about watts and ohms I don't get. In laymans terms these are great speakers for the price. the dome tweeter puts out a great sound for highs for those who are into strings and vocals. and it takes a pounding with the high volume I play my music at If you're going to install these yourself get yourself some metal screws and a metal driil bit cause these speakers don't match the same holes as the factory, I had to make my own. I also bought the 5 way 6 X 9( but I haven't installed them yet. stiil have the factories in now these 6 1/2 make good front door speakers if your looking for bass or to use these as rear speakers in your car then I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a bass alternative in the rear. Good for mids and highs but lousy bass. Not to mention the good price"
3,Be warned...,"The product details for this DVD set lists the format as widescreen, but don't be fooled. I opened this set and was disappointed to find out that only Season 5 and the Christmas Special are widescreen format. Seasons 1-4 are all fullscreen and are marked as such on the bottom of the box.As for the show itself, if you like sarcastic, raunchy humor, you can't go wrong with this show."
3,Great Show but Seasons 1-4 Full(Not Wide) Screen,Be aware as some of the other reviewers have said that this set is not entirely wide screen as the description might lead you to believe. I got seasons 1-4 in full screen with season 5 and the christmas special in wide screen.
5,Fan pack IASIP- DVDs fail,"Im a true fan of Its always sunny in philadelphia, so i bought this package because i like watching it repeatedly.Everything is perfect but my package had at least 3 dvds that DID NOT WORK by any dvd player computer or ps3.I did not report this i have learned that was the down side..So my only advice would be check everything as soon as you get it if not file for return or exchange..Great great showFave character CHARLIE"
5,Mandatory!,"f you even remotely enjoy Always Sunny, this purchase will benefit you.You will be satisfied on planes you didn't even know you could reach.To have the first five seasons and my personal favorite, Christmas Special, for this price is just unreal. Great deal, great hilarity.Despite the above note, I think the seemingly 6-pack beer casing is brilliant also.Bottom line is that this show tests sense of humor- so if you have one, BUY THIS!"
3,Sunny in Philadelphia DVD set,"The DVDs will only play on our XBox 360 and not on our regular DVD player. That is disappointing and I wanted to return them. Because the content is so enjoyable, our son wanted to keep them even if they can only play on XBox."
5,Fantastic,"Always Sunny has long been my favorite show so I figured it's about time to get it on DVD. Great show, great product, and the packaging was sweet"
5,Sunny is awesome,"This is a great way to get seasons 1-5 of Sunny plus the Christmas special. As far as getting anything other than the DVDs, you only get a cool box."
4,Show is great description not,"As most people have discovered the show is amazing, probably the funniest show on TV. The problem I had with this pack is that half of the DVDs came in Widescreen format while the other half came in Fullscreen format. I may be missing something in the description but I assumed they would all be in widescreen. Season 3,5, and the christmas special were widescreen while the 1+2 and 4 were fullscreen and is printed so on the DVD jewel case.That being said I may have missed something in the product description, don't know if it is normal just letting people know what I recieved.But if you are thinking about getting into the show, do it you won't regret it. Regardless of format this show is hilarious."
5,sunny in philadelphia,i absolutely love the sunny in philadelphia series. this purchase was stellar! extremely affordable & shipped quickly. thank you amazon!!
5,Awesome,"Such a great show, wish they had this set on blu ray. Now I just need to get the other seasons not in this set."
5,Must have collection for fans,This is a must have collection for fans of it's always sunny in philadeplhia. Anyone looking for a dvd they can pop in during a week night for a couple of good laughs should buy this.
5,A must buy for fans who don't own any of the series,"50-60 bucks for five seasons and the christmas episodes is an awesome deal. The show offers tremendous rewatchability. The case that holds the DVD cases inside is just a flimsy piece of cardboard, but no matter. Bonus material is there, though its not very fulfilling. All but season four has commentary on select episodes. As a fan I like to watch the commentary for any extra insight they may have to dish out, but there isn't much. Aside from season five episodes with dr. Drew commenting on the interesting psychological aspects of their characters with them, the commentary consists of them just watching and laughing at themselves with you and them making fun of you for sitting around watching the commentary. They may have been joking, but there's always some truth to a joke.Anyway, amazing show, and totally worth the money"
4,"haha, even by yourself","its typical for people to find something amusing but not express this emotion unless someone is around. if you are one of those people you wont be for long. i had seen snippets of this series before and purchased it because i had watched all of my arrested development dvds over and over. it seemed to toe the line so i grabbed it. not disappointed at all. its a slightly more colorful humor(read crass) than ad but im sitting on the deck producing lulz not for the mere expression of amusement to others, but because its that funny. dont read the review incorrecty: its not a full 27 mins of laughs each time but you will catch yourself making snorts 3 or 4 times throughout each episode. for those who are on the fence when considering springing for the entire dvd series my suggestion is to grab the first and second seasons. you wont be disappointed.oh, the packaging for 1-5/christmas resembles a six pack case. what a bunch of clowns."
1,Peter Griffin cloned a bunch of times = This show!,"I took a chance on this series after hearing all the glowing reviews online and from friends and people that I know. Its obvious that I should have just purchased 1 season to get a taste for it.The Show iMHO:In Family Guy, Peter Griffin usually has a thing or fad he plays with throughout an episode. Its mostly used for the cheap laugh or sight gag until it serves its pont. This show does the same thing; only it eat its up, evacuates it, pees on it and then consumes it again and again until episode ends with some tongue in cheek commentary or satire point of view which is then hamfisted into the viewers face. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent Quality,This product has excellent quality. I have notice some health benefits and it looks good.The Bracelet(Medium) is a comfortable fit for my wrist.
2,Entirely in Portuguese,"I rented this because I wanted to know how a Brazilian musician got the same name as the British guy who invented the Boy Scouts. I don't know if he answered that question because the whole thing is in Portuguese. I didn't see any English subtitles on which to click. If you like that ""Girl from Ipanema"" sound, also used on Towa Tei's first disc ""Future Listening,"" then you may enjoy this. Still, this is all guitar and vocals; no other instruments enhance the sound. You know how you can hear Mariah Carey or Patti LaBelle and know they are talented without knowing much else? I didn't see why B. Powell was special; he seemed like any other bossa nova guitarist. He seemed to be a gentleman of Afro-Brazilian descent. In his Portuguese dialogues, I don't know if he addressed class- or race-based oppression in his country. I am not sure whether he addresses the destruction of the Amazon rainforest either. This disc may be just for bossa nova fanatics or homesick Brazilians."
3,"ECW, ECW, ECW...","I was having a huge hype for this PPV because WWE was bringing back the most suicidal wrestling ever and to make it official they made the 2nd ever ECW PPV sponsored by WWE. This PPV had only 3 matches that had weapons which kinda sux cuz everyone thinx of ECW as a weapon filled arena. Second of all it had tooooooooooo many WWE matches like Edge and lita and there was Mysterio(no offense to him) even though Kurt Angle is in ECW they drafted him too late so it was basically a full WWE match with Angle vs Orton. The first match, Lawler vs. Tazz was under 3o seconds long.Terry Funk gets my opinion as the best superstar of the night becasue of his come back after being beaten to a bloody pulp.I say don't get it just rent it.Happy WWE watching/ECW"
5,Predictions for One Night Stand 2,"WWE Championship: Cena(C) vs. RVDIf RVD wins we know Cena will get back the title before Vengeance. I think Cena will ""overcome"" adversity again.Prediction: CenaWorld Championship: Rey Mysterio(C) vs. SabuThis should be a great match. I'm expecting a shocker with Sabu taking this one.Prediction: SabuRandy Orton vs. Kurt Anglethis one's tough to call. Orton needs momentum and Angle needs to prove he's at the top of ECW. I'll give this to Angle.Prediction: Kurt AngleKing vs. TazzWho cares? The faces takes it.Prediction: TazzEdge and Mick Foley vs. Terry Funk and Tommy DreamerI'm really excited about this match. This should be great. I expect Edge to win heading towards a WWE title at Vengeance.Prediction: Edge and Mick Foley"
4,What a crowd!,"Most of the matches were pretty good, but I felt a little cheated with the Sabu/Mysterio match and the fact that they wouldn't let RVD get the clean win he deserved. It was a great DVD and the addition of Barely Legal is an awesome bonus. My biggest issue was that I watched it with my 9 year-old sister and had to try to talk over the crowds chants. The crowd was radically different from what I've grown used to, even watching through the attitude era. But, it's exciting and was still great to see some of the old ECW guys, even if it was in an odd context."
4,The 2nd Return Of ECW,"Not as good as the first ONS but still a soild PPV. At least the matches were longer then the ones from the 2005 event. The best matches on the card were the Kurt Angle-Randy Orton match,The 6 person intergender tag team which was a good reminder of the Japanese hardcore matches and The WWE championship match between John Cena & RVD which was entertaining as well as a good soild match. The worst match was the Tazz-Jerry Lawler which a far cry from their matches from both these wrestlers's prime years mainly becuase it was too short & bitter sweet. The World's title match between Rey Mysterio & Sabu was a good soild match and could have done better if not for the referee's stoppage on this match. The rest were OK. I give this event a 8 and a half out of 10."
3,REAL ECW fans ban this product,"Im a real fan of ECW. The new ECW makes me sick. The WWE aviods pushing what made ECW famous like Sabu, Justin Credible, Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Balls Mahoney, etc and shove WWE throwaways like Test, Shannon Moore (wasnt he in TNA?), and The Basham Brothers into the organzation. ECW also denies why RVD was suspended, while the old ECW would have told the fans about it. ECW can still be better then TNA, but they need to rethink there opitions and of what made them famous, the fans. So think of what I just wrote and watch an old, unedited ECW dvd. Can you spot the difference?"
2,WWECW is just plain bad,"I loved the first one night stand and had high hopes for this one, but was greatly dissapointed. The first ONS had that old school ECW feel, where as this one you could tell Vince would be going through every little detail to make sure it would be like the ""new"" ECW, which is just terrible."
4,Response to R.A. McKenzie,"It's funny that you say you have'nt seen a Rabid crowd during the Cena vs RVD match since Hogan Vs Rock at Mania, you can't compare this to that. First of all, Hammerstein ballroom had at most filled the arena max to atleast 3,000 people, and your comparing it to Hogan vs Rock where the arena had held over 25,000 people all chanting. Of course it's going to be loud in a small arena like the Hammerstein, but in NO WAY is it anywhere near Hogan & Rock, that's just laughable, now Cena Vs Trips on the other hand was close to that HANDS DOWN!Now on to ECW ONS 2, Very good payper view! LOL!!!"
3,As a novelist he's a pretty good sociologist.,"This was the first Andrew Greeley novel I've read, and I found it more than a little disappointing. There are effectively two levels of characterization here: All the ""bad"" guys are cardboard caricatures and all the ""good"" guys are self-portraits. Not a single idea here that he didn't better develop in his non-fiction writing. If you're looking for good Pope fiction, I'd suggest any of the Morris West novels instead."
2,Not One Of His Best,"This book de-evolves into a manifesto of what Greeley would like to see in the next Pope. It's almost the author's fantasy scenario about extreme liberalism coming to dominance in the Catholic Church, right down to a Spanish Pope who wears business suits and who used to be a married husband and father. This far-fetched novel has so little material on which to construct a plot that Greeley concocts a love story around his Papal election politics. There is a reconciliation of a married couple on the outs, and a half-hearted aside into a secondary plotline about a man who wants to murder the next Pope. Oh, and Father Greeley drags his favorite Chicago Cardinal into the book to fill more pages and gives the poor old man a life and death personal crisis. This soap opera could have been a good short story but it's a dismal novel. Virgin And Martyr and Angels of September are better books by Andrew Greeley, and a few of the Blackie Ryan mysteries are fun, but White Smoke is a clunker."
2,Partly interesting - mainly trite,"Yes, I read it through to the end - but, while the premise may have been fascinating, the plot was dreadful.Vatican politics are as old as the Church, but the absurd vision of a situation where a handful of radical conservatives are depicted as having no redeeming qualities, yet the entire balance of the Church is eagre to support one candidate for the papacy, is beyond belief.If ecclesiastical politics are as old as Christianity, sex is as old as Adam. Perhaps Father Greeley could remember this, and stop creating characters who seem to think they invented it."
3,"Not bad, but not his best","I enjoyed most of the book, but would have appreciated it if Mr. Greeley's editor would have reworked the book a little. It really dragged on occasion and his all white or all black characters could have been nuanced for the readers sake. There are so few Catholic writers out there that I will buy and read anything he puts out I'm afraid, but I think there is a new star rising on the Catholic author podium. I recently finished ""A Force of Habit"" It has suspense, mystery, and characters who breathe. Spend more time on your next book, Mr. Greeley, but DO keep them coming!"
2,"A hackneyed ""expose"" of papal politics, tho' with some charm","This may be one of the better novels of papal election I have read in a while (except Hadrian VII by FW Rolfe), but it suffers from Catholic moralizing and a sycophantic fascination with the Roman class system. The inevitability of the plot and the predictability of the characterization may draw the reader on, but for all the wrong reasons. Nonetheless, there are some pretty set pieces and the atmosphere of a conclave will of itself always cast a spell."
5,Blacky to the recue!,"Blackie, with some electronic help and the assistance of a Black Roman Princesss, prevents some ultra right wing skulduggery in the election of a new Pope. It is a glorious tale by a uneaqualed Irish story teller. That he is a preist, a sociologist, and part of the ""liberal wing"" of the american church is obvious and may spoil the tale for some. But everything could happen. May God intervene where Blackie can not. In any case you will increase your understanding of Vatican politics and how they affect you, no matter where and how you worship."
1,IMPOSSIBLE!,"It is fiction of course. It can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is IMPOSSIBLE! Many reviewers are upset. Upset perhaps but they should not be worried. The Church is protected by Christ's promise that it will not err. Any person of faith sees this book as FICTION. It is a poor attempt to disguise Greely's left wing theology as fiction. The message to those liberals who find ""hope"" for their cause in this book: IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. Recommended reading: ""Women Priests And Other Fantasies"" Greely and his followers are delusional."
2,Burn it.,"While the story of the Vatican election is interesting, the work as a whole is painful to read. The love story is contrived and completely telegraphed from the start, anybody could scribble the subplot on a napkin after 10 pages. And the ""action"" part at the end is unbelievably trite. The right person shows up at the exact right time needed to avoid disaster and dispaches the villain with a smile and a quip to boot. It's nauseating!And one more thing: Andrew, lose the cute and perennially changing nicknames for Herself, The Princess, Her Highness, etc. etc. It just doesn't work. But then, apparently, neither did you when you wrote this abomination."
4,South Pacific Adventure,"Oh to be young, sailing the South Pacific in your trusty 27 foot Albin Vega sailboat. No longer young, not an accomplished sailor and without an Albin Vega to cruise John Neal brought me as close to my dream trip as I will probably ever get."
2,Mascots & Nicknames,This is ONLY the Mascots names and nicknames. There is no history of how the nicknames and mascots came about. I really want to know how they got the names and mascots and what they mean to the colleges and the community that they are in.
5,Great book for kids,"I bought this book for my fourth grader and it had a great impact on his performance in class.He finished the book in about a month and he improved enough that he was moved into the math enrichment group at school.The only problem (if you can call it a problem) is that the book requires parent involvement, as there are no explanations for the children to learn from and many of the problems had not yet been reviewed in class. So you will have to review his work and explain the concepts that he doesn't know. In my case, I had to teach him long division, some statistical concepts (mean, range, mode, etc.) and a little geometry before he learned it in school.We liked the book so much that we bought the second grade one for our younger child, and we noted a marked improvement in his school work as well."
5,Excellent,Orthodox religion and homosexuality. Always a no win situation. Very subtle but profoundly portrayed. I enjoyed this film very much.
3,Stiff Penalty,A sad story that recalls my life as a closeted homosexual husband many years ago. Though Ran has a beautiful kissy face and luscious lips the sexual scenes are stiff and awkward looking...especially their first intimate encounter up on the roof. More revealing dialogue might have helped viewers understand their motives. After being dumped by another gay man (in denial) the jilted young lover barely has time to recover before he immediately jumps from the skillet into the fire with eyes wide open. This complex relationship needs more time to develop but I guess a small budget doesn't allow a lot of reel time. Did the married man commit suicide at the end? I didn't.
4,Being gay and orthodox Jew isn't a piece of cake,"It's not a first gay-theme motion picture coming from Israel, but definitely one of a kind. Gays among orthodox Jews. Very specific and delicate matter. It's enough to say that Judaism doesn't tolerate homosexuality.A few months ago I saw a documentary ""Trembling before god"". It deals with similar problem. I advise you to watch them both.""Eyes wide open"" is well directed and played. Two thumbs up."
3,Eyes Wide Open - Good movie except for cop-out ending,"Eyes Wide Open was an engrossing movie, dealing with homosexuality within the environs of an ultra-orthodox Jewish community. Set in Jerusalem, Israel, the movie dwells on the extreme pressure put on living with this closed community, not just for the two main characters, but for anyone who is ""different.""I would have rated this movie much higher, but I did not like the pat ending, although perhaps that could have been the only solution seen by one of the homosexual pair.Everything else was done really well, giving the viewer a deep look into a closed world. I still recommend this movie. I'm curious to see if other people could think of a different ending while staying within the lines of the story."
2,Boring,"I expected so much more from this film caught on the Sundance Channel which generally shows some wonderful Asian gems as Ghost Actress. This one was muddled at the start; the photography was so dark and the storyline was not that linear or clear.My first reaction at the site of the house is why he didn't sell it right off. Talk about white elephants; this house could have held a couple of herds of elephants.As for his leaving or selling the house, I can only conclude that, other than plain stupidity, he might have been under the curse and really not able to leave, letting the curse play out. The fact that their friends were pulled in reminded me of The Grudge where everyone who enters the house suffers the consequence. But the Grudge was a far superior movie.Rent this! You'll only watch it once."
2,"Slow, linear, and boring without suitable atmosphere.","This movie is slow, boring and mostly predictable ghost story. There are not many scares. That's not necessarily a bad thing with most atmospheric horror films, but this one really doesn't build much tension or mystery. Its told in a style where flashbacks reveal most of the turns in the story. Also, I ended up empathizing with the antagonist in the film, which isn't really a good thing when attempting to build a sense of dread in the audience.There was a neat ad-hoc dead baby in a vase mausoleum, which is something I've never seen in a film before.Some of the filmmaking is rather nice, but too bad the story's mostly a dud."
2,Good but misleading,"This is a well done book but the title is misleading. Jewish parents will especially want to take care, as this book is really written for non-Jewish children to learn about the Jewish Bible. THe book references the Jewish Bible from a Christian point of view, and references historical characters as to their distance in time to Jesus. I wish they had been more explicit about this; in fact, by prominently featuring the name of a rabbi who wrote the FOreword on the book's cover, the publishers seem to be purposely misleading potential buyers as to the nature of the book"
1,Recieved this bible...,"I am a Jewish parent who is homeschooling my 6-year old son. I was (and still am) looking for something I can use for Bible studies and was given this book from a friend. This is a terrible book for someone looking to learn or teach about the Jewish religion. It is skewed from a Christian perspective. If you are looking for something which truly introduces or explains the Jewish religion, then AVIOD THIS BOOK."
2,I am a Jewish parent who was mislead,"I should have examined this book more closely before I bought it. I didn't realize that it wasn't truly a Jewish Bible. I would not have bought it. When I read it to my kids, I edit out the parts I do not endorse. Eventually I will probably give it away and get my kids a real Jewish book. A pity, because it has nice little stories in it. DK was very deceptive when marketing this book."
4,Accurate and yet age-appropriate for preschoolers,"I looked at approximately 20 children's bibles before selecting this one to read with my pre-schooler. It does not assign a gender to God, the stories remain true to original form and yet are written in an age-appropriate format for children. My daughter enjoyed the pictures and I enjoyed the historical information in the margins. I would reccomend this book for all faiths, but especially for parents who want their children to get an accurate exposure to the Old Testament and the Israelites."
1,There needs to be a 0 stars button,"I bought this book and we noticed tonight that there are Christian pictures in it. For the story of Isaac they have a picture of Jesus being circumcised!!! What the heck is that??? Also some of the other pictures are of people like Isaiah (I think) with a sundisk behind his head, clearly a Christian artist. I am shaking my head. Annoyed. This book is for Messianic Jewish children."
3,Only lasted one year,This tie out only lasted a year when used to occasionally tie out a 20 lb house dog on a runner. The cord ended up breaking right at the point where it connects to the clasp.
3,"Works, but...","So it's strong enough to hold my 35 pound blue heeler (who's deceptively strong btw), but there's an oversight that really is unforgivable. Why would you design a tie-out, which is DESIGNED to be used outdoors, that doesn't have stainless steel latches at the ends? They started rusting about a month after I got this. I really just don't understand why you wouldn't use stainless... (which isn't quite as strong as standard steel, but is plenty strong enough for this application)"
2,The lead breaks in cold weater,"When I received the tie out I thought it was perfect. It was the correct length, durable and the blue coated line looked great. I have had this product for four weeks. Today I tied up the dog to go outside to go to the bathroom and 2 minutes later the dog was gone! I ran outside int he snow to look for the dog and luckily after 4-5 minutes I found the dog safe. When I returned to the house I found that the lead had broken off at the base which allowed my dog to wander off. As I mentioned, I have had this new product for four weeks? I purchased the ""medium"" tie out as my dog weighs 12 pounds.I would not recommend this product to anyone who loves their dog."
5,It does the job!,I have a 12lb mini schnauzer so I probably could have gotten away with a small dog tie out. But this one has worked great.
3,"Strong line, tangles/warps easily","I bought this for a recent camping trip so as to prevent my dog from wandering off into other campsites. After two days of moderate use, the line was kinked, curled, and bent in a number of places, probably due to getting snagged on rocks or other impediments during the course of use. I have since taken this line home for use in my backyard, and the end closest to the stake has only gotten worse. The two feet of line closest to the stake looks like a slinky, having curled/coiled itself without obvious cause.That being said, the line is strong and, while the coating has cracked or scraped away in some small sections, the metal wire within is not frayed or broken."
3,Screw it all the way into the ground,"I didn't screw the spike part completely into the soil, leaving maybe a three-inch area of the spike above ground. A 23-pound dog in a harness managed to bend the metal about 30 degrees from straight. They rate it as good for up to a 45-pound dog.If you buy this, screw it all the way down, moving it if you encounter a rock, and get the next size/weight up if your dog is anywhere close to the recommended size."
5,A look at the Revolutionary War generation,"Nelsen and co-author Doug Wead's 'What Price Freedom: The Adventures of Early American Heroes' is a series of short biographies of 9 men and 1 woman of the Revolutionary War generation. None of the biographies is too detailed (vary from 7-17 pages) and none focus on the more controversial parts of their lives (like Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, for example).Nevertheless, the book is pretty well done and chock full of good quotes.The biographies included are:Benjamin Franklin,Nathaniel GreeneAlexander Hamilton,John Hancock,Patrick Henry,Thomas Jefferson,John Paul Jones,Francis Marion,Deborah Sampson,George Washington.John Adams is left out, but then again, when this book was written, Adams was not as popular as he is today. If you are an Adams fan, he is quoted extensively in the book, which is one of the reasons I was surprised he was left out.I give this book a B+. Solid introduction to many of the players in the Revolutionary War."
2,Original Power Cord Does Not Fit,"The unit was not for the HP models as stated. It comes without a power cord. When we tried to plug in the power cord that came with the lap top, the plug would not fit into the docking station port. Not a very good deal if you have to buy another power cord or make a return....."
4,Really enjoyed!!,"I really enjoyed this video. It is great for someone who is not real familiar with how to care for house plants such as: leaves that have burnt tips, the best time to water and fertilize and how much, how to take care of insects using house hold products and more. It's not overwhelming either. I was just looking for an updated version for household product suggestions, since it's now over 25yrs later since this video was released. If you are wondering how to better care for your house plants and some of your outdoor plants to protect from insects, I recommend this video. Enjoy!"
4,Venerable performances!,"Amadeus Quartet always kept that serene lyricism and sheer musicality that one expect from Mozart. This album in its moment was a true reference item, due the exultant and cheerful expression.I recommended it without hesitation."
3,It is dangerous to be over-protective,"the twins have a boy friend whose parents are not letting him do anything,not even try out for the school band!This ends up with him running away to a dangerous,ready to crumble at any minute building"
4,Unadulterated Hip-Hop,"To Begin With, The Cassette Got To Me Within 2 days Of The Order.That Was a Very Good Look.The Merchandise Was In Mint Condition--All In All, I was Very Pleased."
4,Waterloo Keyboard tray,"Works great, easy to install. One little issue that bothers me - the slideout mouse rest rattles if not extended fully. There is a little vertical play when extended. Otherwise very sturdy. Would buy again."
2,Too heavy and bulky,I ended up returning this product (which the company seems to be doing without a problem) due to it's overall size and weight. It is very bulky and not really what I was hoping for.
5,works well,"The tray offers a lot of flexibility to position as needed. The fact that the mouse tray can be pushed inside makes it easy to fit the keyboard tray under my desk when not in use. The mouse tray can slide all the way across to the other side, so that right-handed and left-handed users can share the tray."
1,Rocket Scientist Required,"This a well-made,sturdy tray; however, the slide rack was much too long to fit my standard-sized desk. I also found the instructions were seriously inadequate. The biggest problem was the adjustability of the height -- I could never get it down to a comfortable level. This would be a good tray for very large desks and for those who need the tray to be at a higher level, but I do not recommend this for anyone with a U-shaped desk or anyone who likes a tray height that does not stress the shoulders."
4,Good collection,"This is a good set of Christmas movies. The one thing I didn't like was how difficult the discs are to get out of the cases, which lead to one disc being broken in the first day. I know that's our fault for not keeping them out of our 3 yr old's reach, but other cases aren't as hard as these are."
5,Love it!,"Great product, great price! Thank you Amazon! Now I can share the classics with my kids at any time! They love it just as much as I do. :)"
4,When it runs its great,"These are great Christmas classics. The only thing that kept this product from getting 5-stars is that it does not only work. For some reason, when selecting your video from the menu the disks like to freeze. They do not do this all the time, but they do it often enough that it is annoying. This may be more a fault of my DVD player, but these are the only DVDs my DVD player struggles with. To make matters worse, when they freeze, I have to unplug my DVD in order to unfreeze it."
4,Random stuff with true classics,"I bought this because I could not find the classics I wanted in one place. I love ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" and it can be hard to find. This collection has mostly classics, but a couple of duds too. It was still lots of fun to watch my favorites with my daughter and nephews."
5,Great collection,"We love this collection of Christmas movies. We try to watch them every year, but sometimes we miss them as they only air once. Now we will no longer miss them. They are the older, perhaps less polished specials, with narrations by folks like Burl Ives. Can't beat the voices in this collection. Highly recommend."
1,Don't buy amazon instant video,"I purchased the instant video for the classics Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph. Unfortunately, the instant version has completely different videos. No Rudolph and no Frosty. I can't figure out how to contact Amazon and correct this error. THE INSTANT VIDEO IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT."
4,the original chriistmas classic gift set,the kids of course love it as we all do what can i say it is a christmas thing to do watch these movies. and everyone love them.
4,A Classic Set in Modern Format,"I grew up watching these holiday shows and every year, without fail, we watch them again. But alas, we previously had the VHS set and our VHS player was retired. I was happy to get a copy of the blu-ray versions and got right back in the holiday spirit when watching them again.They transferred well to Blu-ray even though I'm sure the original technology/quality was nothing like what blu-rays provide now.Good menu screen, fun to watch, great for my kids to continue the seasonal tradition!The blu-ray set is obviously a bit more of an investment so it's your call whether to choose the blu-ray or dvd versions. But this set is high quality.I was provided a copy of this set for an unbiased and honest review."
3,gift set,An ok video but not what I thought it should be. my grandaughter likes the frosty but the santa video scares her. I prefer the new animations of today.
2,Not as good as you remember...,I remembered this as a holiday classic from the days of broadcast. It is not. The story is lame and the animation is weak. My kids wanted to enjoy it but clearly will not on second viewing.
3,It's ok,"Its a nice story of christmas, I was expecting something different. Afterall, it's a classical and it's good to watch with the family during christmas."
4,YOU MEAN PEA SOUP?,"Truly an amazing collection! I have watched these movies growing up and the Christmas season just would not be the same without them! Of course you have the most amazing stories of a certain Red_nosed reindeer, but as mentioned by a few others there is one misfit in this bunch we could all do without and that would be the Frosty the snow man that some how snuck its way into this pleasent box set. While the films are in higher bluray quality, the charming stop animation qualities of a finer time have not been lost and the sound quality maintains the delightful sound of its traditional recording, with just a little sharper quality! All in all sans the snowman flcik a 5 out 5!"
3,Wasn't sure what I was getting,"When I ordered this DVD set, I really wanted the original 4 movies, Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, and The Little Drummer Boy, and then saw that their was an option to get a few more of the Rankin-Bass movies I had never seen before. The price wasn't much more, so I ordered the 8 movies, but the options were very confusing. I even went back a few days later to double-check what I had ordered and I thought I had ordered just the 4 movies. Then my order came in and even on the movies themselves, I had to really look and figure out what I had ordered. Apparently I had ordered the 8 movies. I'm not sure how to make this more simple, but it is very confusing; I have ordered quite a bit of stuff off of Amazon and know what to look for when I order my stuff. I love the movies I got, but it shouldn't have been this difficult."
4,Great little collection,"This is a nice little set of classic Christmas movies. My 2 year old son is enjoying them, and my wife and I are having fun with the memories of our childhood.The don't seem to have been remastered as the sound isn't great all of the time (not bad at all). But personally that adds to the nostalgia for me."
5,Christmas Classic,"No issues, it is the christmas classic we all know and love and now I get to share it with my kids."
5,Fun,As always great holiday fun! Super happy they shipped quickly as my old VCR tapes were DONE! I couldn't be more please that they have put them together to make it much nicer to have them all together on one disk. These are the original stories.
3,Christmas Classics,"It's great to see a compolation of all these movies. Loved them as a kid and I enjoy watching them to this day. They are the digitally redone versions of the originals. They are just that the originals, just on a disk. The only issue I had was that my computer didn't recognize that there was anything on the disk and wanted to upload files onto the disk as if it was empty. But after playing with VLC I was able to access the main menu. This could be an isolated instance but just be warned.If you would ignore the disk not playing like a dvd it would easily get a 5/5, but having to jump through hoops to watch the movies take all the fun out of the experience."
3,Older video and it shows....,"My 2 yr old granddaughter is still a little young for longer videos. She seemed interested for a short while but then stopped watching. As an adult, these older classic Christmas videos are so different from the hi-tech and polished seamless animation of today's quality. But I have to believe the little ones still like the characters and dialogue from years past. Some things change and some don't."
5,Great Collection of the Classics!!!,I have a three year old and this was a great collection of all the classics that I wanted to share with her. I am so happy and she loved them and as an added bonus I also purchased it at a great price!
1,Anyone else?,I started watchin this is blu ray and was very disappointed.It will not go infull frame and looks terrible i have two black bars on the sides of it when its playing.At the start up everything is in full frame but when its on the movie itsin 4:3 mode.very very annoyed by this. Anyone else have this problem?
2,waste of Blu Ray resources,"Nor really worth it to get something like this on blu ray, even if it is remastered. Sound doesn't take advantage of it, and it surely is much much smaller than the disc can hold. Could have put all of these plus special features plus the audio cd on here and had half the room to spare. Just get the dvd"
2,Not as advertised,"I saw at least 1 other review to this but wanted to add my own. I, too, bought the 3 disc Blu-Ray set which stated in the product description there were 7 different shows in the set. There are, in fact, only 4. The Rudolph and Santa Claus... discs have just those shows and the 3rd disc, original Frosty, does have 'Frosty Returns' as well.I was skeptical buying this set as I wasn't sure there were actually 7 shows in the set but after reading several reviews this was the fact I went ahead and purchased the box set. Some reviewers actually stated in detail which episodes were on which discs so either these are made up reviews or some of us didn't the set others did.All in all, very disappointed I didn't get what I was told I was buying... :^("
3,Don't get this for the story....,"The movie is in some Asian language... Sometimes there are subtitles, sometimes not. Sometimes the subtitles are in Japanese or Chinese.... NO NUDITY... some great tight skimpy outfits and several cat fight scenes... There was some potential for nude scenes, but they did not carry through. Some great sexy kind of lingerie throughout the movie.My didgital download did not include the second movie...Don't know whats up with that."
2,Don't even bother,"This product did arrive right on time, and is the only reason it has stars. Cat Girl had no plot what so ever. I was just 2 girls given ""cat powers"" and wrestled the entire time.Super dimension Odyssey Tritia was not as bad for a low budget film. I think if the Princess showed more emotion, the film would have been better.These found their way to the outside dumpster real fast."
1,Not much about religious practices,"I work with American Indians and was looking for a book on their religion as it is very diverse among different tribes. This book does not have too much on religion and had too much on Christian missionaries. If you're looking for the latter then this is the book. However, if you're looking for the former than I would not recommend it. For example, it doesn't mention anything on Pow-Wows which, from what I have experienced, is a major religious event each year."
2,Buyer beware,"This version is unreadable on the Kindle due to too many line breaks. It is readable (barely) on the IPad if you set the font size to minimum and I was enjoying Live and Let Die from the sample so was disappointed that you can no longer purchase it. There are numerous problems in the text, e.g. The second l in double ls appears as a space and some characters appear as the wrong letter, but, the whole series of Bond books for $2! If they bring it back, definitely experiment with the sample before purchase."
2,rubbish,Why is it not possible to click on a title to go to another title ? Now I have to browse manually to get to another book.
1,I don't see how it could have been worse,I just viewed the free sample on my Droid RAZR and it was just awful. There are line breaks everywhere so it's very difficult to read.
2,Somewhere between disappointing and dreadful,"This book is quite dreary. It is populated by horrid, selfish people, who are either weak, evil or clueless.Teresa's sleep disorder is a perfect metaphor for her unrelenting passivity--she has no life skills except seduction and being ornamental.She survives only by her face, certainly not her wits, as she doesn't have many of those.Hofffman's attempt at magical realism is a failure -- it is just fanciful twaddle."
1,Not one of her best!,"I'm a big Alice Hoffman fan but I just didn't get this book at all. I didn't realize was why Teresa falling for her own brother and why the both of them (Teresa and Silver) treated their incestous relationship as something normal? No one really taking it seriously except Bergen who learned it too late. Everyone else just accepts and moves on. I couldn't understand why Silver motivation for anything especially his anger. I understand their father's influence over the children and how their parent's violent relationship had traumatized them forever but beyond that. I just couldn't get into, maybe if the incestous relationship was taken out I would had understood it better. I read practically all her books this is not her best try, ""Here on Earth""(excellent), ""Second Nature""(breathtaking)."
2,White Horses,"I was very disappointed in this book. It is hard to identify with any of the characters; I didn't find even one I really liked. Well, maybe Harper. The theme was depressing, even if true for some people. Usually I can't stop reading and am sorry to have a book end. With this one, the end couldn't come fast enough. Usually I like Alice Hoffman's books, but this definitely isn't up to her usual level."
2,Where are the White Horses???,"Rarely do I read a book that I find so underdeveloped as this one. The characters drift along without making any kind of decisions about thier lives, except bad ones. The relationships that they have are unrewarding, and unexplainable. Teresa and her brother Silver have an insestual relationship that is impossible to understand. Dina marries King Conners for no apparent reason, King Conners leaves for an unexplainable reason, Dina falls in love with Bergen, and I don't know why. Silver marries Lee- but he hates her- Teresa almost marries Joey and that relationship is a rediculous sham. At the end of the book- I wanted to shake everyone into reality- at least all of the characters that were left. Most of them just quietly disappeared from the pages, except Dina, who died. This was truly a rediculous story, with unlikable characters in search of mysterious men, or was it white horses? Don't waste your time."
2,"Okay, but....","Good read, but I cannot believe the Kindle edition is riddled with typos. I am not sure how an older book like this one goes from written to electronic version, but I have a strong feeling off-shore assistance was the reason. But whatever the reason, it is really irritating!"
1,Disappointment,"A fan of Practical Magic, I looked forward to this lesser known work by Alice Hoffman, and since I live in Santa Fe, I thought I'd enjoy the book's New Mexico setting. Unfortunately, the book depicts Santa Fe architecture and the surrounding landscape inaccurately and is poorly edited to boot. There is a typo on almost every page of the e-book, as if someone scanned a hard copy and didn't proofread the results. I'm not finishing White Horses, and it was a waste of money."
5,I loved the way Theresa smelled like roses when she slept.,"It is rare that you hope for a romance to suceed when it is tied to one of the last remaining tabos; incest. I felt for Thersea. She was raised to love the poorest of biological choices; her own brother. I believed along with her that he was the only path to happiness. Hoffman proves that she is as adept with southwestern folklore as she is with the New England variety in this parody of Sleeping Beauty. This book explores many of the same themes as ""Here on Earth"". Both heroines are fated from their youth to love the wrong man but I feel that the heat of the southwest adds an intensity to this story. In this setting, anything is possible."
3,White Horses,"This was one of Hoffman's earlier works, and I don't recommend it as an introduction to her many beautiful books. The magic and colors of a Hoffman fairy tale are all in place here, but the storyline is, well, creepy. Silver and his sister have a romantic relationship which is strange and a bit disturbing, and the only really likable character is Bergen, a middle aged Private investigator. It's an okay read, but try Practical Magic, Here On Earth, or At Risk instead to see Hoffmans real art of enchanting storytelling."
3,A book about relationships,"This was a book about a girl who becomes fixated on her brother, which was a bit twisted but interesting nonetheless. The main character chooses to forgive his flaws and instead sees him as perfect, despite all of the bad qualities he has... something all women do when we see ourselves as ""in love."" An inspirational and heart wrenching story."
3,Mixed feelings,"This book wasn't what I was expecting at all. I love Hoffman's writing style and the way she adds a hidden sense of the supernatural in her writing. This story was captivating, but I was completely unprepared for the incest. I think this is a wonderful story, but it's hard to look around the incest for most people. Me included. This is definatly a book to pick up with an open mind and to be looked at from different angles. I did like certain aspects of the book. There's a statement in this about our expectations of romance and love from the tales we all grew up with."
1,Doesn't work right!,"I bought this for my 92 Accord EX. The removing adaptor and the receiving cup were too long to fit in the C-frame and I couldn't press the old ball joint out. After fiddling around with it for 20 minutes, I gave up and ended up putting a socket over the ball joint and hammering it out. Then I couldn't use the tool to install a new ball joint, because the 38355 receiving cup is not included in this set, or the 7249 ball joint set. So I ended up hammering the new ball joint in too. Very disappointed I spent a lot of money on these tools and I couldn't even use them when I needed them. I'm keeping the 7249 set, because it will (hopefully) work with many other vehicles and will probably be useful to me in the future. But I'm not sure what I'm going to do with this 7996 set."
2,Just plain bad,"""very loose fitting, the elastic going around the waist is way too slack. A very bad fit. I do not recommend to anyone"
5,Inside My Heart: Choosing to live with Passion and Purpose,"Robin McGraw's book was one of the most inspirational books for women I have ever read. I admire her and all that she and her husband are doing to make a difference in the lives of people all over the world. This would be the best gift any one could give to the women in their family. I certainly hope this couple keep on writing many books. Through this book, Robin has made me realize how important it is for women to be strong and to feel good about themselves and to live with purpose and most of all with passion. This book is definitely a winner!! Many thanks to Robin for sharing her life in this book with everyone with compassion and love."
2,Making that choice!,"sometimes is so very hard! Today, I can make a choice of what I read and write. This book was a bit general, but if you listen to Robin on Dr. Phil's show, she writes as she speaks! Robin is a classy lady who obviously adores her family. Thanks Robin, for sharing your story as a mom and a wife. I really appreciated her positive attitude in everything, reminds me of what my grama used to say, ""If you can't say something nice, say nothing."""
3,Inside my heart,Hi I was a little disappointed with this book more like a biography but still a good read.
1,humanism,"Save yourself the money in buying this book. I read it and it smacks of humanism and the ""just do it"" mentality. A cash cow book and we've heard it all before."
4,Uplifting inspiring read.,"The book was very fast and enjoyable reading book. It contained a lot of humor and overall empowering women no matter whether they chose to be a doctor or a housewife. It was a different look at the other side of Dr. Phil. He definitely is not ""Dr. Phil"" at home. I think she demonstrates how women should require others to treat them with respect."
5,A must read for Women,Very enjoyable to see success out of adversity. The Author's candor was refreshing.
1,Who cares?,"Horrible book with chapter titles like ""A Wife's Heart- Choosing to Do Whatever Makes My Husband Happy"". Give me a HUGE break. How convenient that he's a bajillionaire, and now you ""choose"" to get botox injections from the looks of the book cover. No one cares how you live. I was forced to look at it because I had to process it through.p.s., some of us think Dr. Phil is an idiot. But there's no accounting for the taste of the general population."
4,A book every wife and mother should read,"This lovely, yet powerful book, took me by surprise. I honestly expected the book to read like Dr. Phil's books, but I was totally wrong. Robin's honesty is refreshing. And, although she speaks about her own good and not so good experiences as a daughter, wife and mother, many will identify with her as I did. I believe Robin's story serves to remind us (women) to love ourselves first so we can love our children and husbands even better."
1,robin mcgraw book,"did not care for it, VERY boring, I've owned it for a year and still have not finished it and no desire to."
1,Totally Disappointing,"I was hoping for some ""real life"" stories and experiences that would help women from all walks of life. Instead I read a sugary sweet version of her life that fell into place because she decided to be a strong woman. How very simple but unrealistic. Who has such a perfect marriage and children? Happy or content I can understand...but perfect? I would have rather read her mother's story."
1,Inside my heart,"This book made Robin McCraw look like she has a huge ego. She thinks she does everything right. I think she's controlled. The part I really didn't like was when her son was projectile vomiting and she took him to a doctor who did nothing really. I had the same situation, my doctor told me to go straight to the hosptal, an infant can become completely dehydrated in 24 hours. This should be called, ""another stepford wife""."
2,I was disappointed....,"I LOVED Robin's talk at the Women of Faith conference, so I bought the book. And I was disappointed. At Women of Faith, she really proclaimed her Christianity. In the book, it seems watered down, almost hidden. I guess I was looking for more meat."
1,Stuck on herself,"I always enjoyed seeing Robin sitting in the audience, thought she seemed like a neat down to earth person. This book proves otherwise. She is stuck on herself, in her own perfect world, and likes to brag about it. No one can be THAT sweet as she describes herself even in her worst moments she brags she is always thinking and taking care of someone else. She is so busy bragging about how good she looks, and has the money to take care of herself. She does not have a clue what is it like to clip a coupon or shop for bargains.I got this book at a bargain price, and doubt if I could sell if for 25 cents at a garage sale and it is hard back. I might try to give it away. Come down to earth Robin. Not everyone sees all the flaws in ""Phillip"" as you do, and can revamp him and keep him in line as you do cuz you are ""so cute in your cut off shorts..."""
1,"Robin has too many ""yes"" people around her....","If Robin wants attention, then she should get her own show. Maybe she can get on ""The View."" Although Robin says that she is writing from the heart, you never feel her heart. The book is poorly written--so much so that it was either burn it or return it--so I returned it for a full refund. Robin is much more inspirational verbally than she is in writing. A good editor would have gone a long way in helping to resuscitate this book."
4,A delightful tale!,"I love to watch Dr. Phil and I absolutely adore Robin. However, this book didn't offer the type of guidance I was looking for. What I did enjoy, was her honesty and candor. Robin takes us into her personal life as a daughter, wife, and mother. The message that we get the life we ask for and expect is very true. Although for some readers, who've experienced real low's in life, this may not be the book for you."
5,A must have read for every mom,This is a must read for all the moms. As a mother its very easy to get trapped up in the everyday role of caring for our husband and our children. This book serves as a reminder to put ourselves first. Nice job by Robin.
2,inside my heart,"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover. i did not want to put it down. I finished it in a matter of a few days and i read it all at work. this was a real eye opener for me and it came along at the perfect time in my life. i realized i have to choose to make my life what i wanted, a great life does not just fall into your life and you do not have to take whatever comes your way.i would recommend ever women at any age read this book!!!thank you Robin McGrawjessica dupresulphur la"
3,"Thank you, Robin!","Robin's book has helped me be stronger, speak up for myself and I am in the process of taking better care of myself. I thank this book for that. I felt the writing style must be just like listening to Robin. She is a terrific wife and mother...a very strong woman."
3,Got it for someone else...,"My sister-in-law really wanted this book, so I got it for her birthday. From what I hear.. she liked it, but expected more. Personally, I dont think just being married to Dr. Phil (who is awesome!) qualifies someone to write a book. I cant stand the lady!"
1,Don't Bother,"I think the Dr. Phil show has gone downhill and has become extremely tabloid. If I watch at all, I make sure it's a show without Robin on it. I was in the bookstore with my son and skimmed the book within an hour while waiting for him. It confirmed my opinion of Robin - she is like a bobble-head of a Stepford Wife. The book was simplistic, egotistical and trite - nothing to be gained from it."
3,too preachy,The book was somewhat interesting because of who she is. I don't think that it was well written. It was too preachy for my taste.
1,Inside my heart,"I have been trying and trying to get into this book but somehow I can't. She goes on and on about being a Mom and how it's her life passion, you get the impression it was written and published just so her boy's will have a book from their Mom when they get older for a keep sake. She doen't engage the reader in anyway. I don't find her little stories about her and Philip that great. To her definse, I guess it is hard to write a book someone would throw themselves into. I don't quite know what I was exspecting, but it wasn't this, it's only about her not how you can relate to it to your life at all. This is NOT a self help book in anyway. This is only a book about her life and nothing between any lines will you get out of it."
4,Living the good life,"Robin McGraw is the wife of the famed television therapist Dr. Phil McGraw, but she is much more than that. In her book, Robin McGraw: Inside My Heart: Choosing to Live with Passion and Purpose she shares her life's philosophy and personal struggles.She delves back to how she met Dr. Phil and how she works to keep that relationship working. This book feels like you are having an intimate one on one talk with her and discover that she is a woman with a big heart and open mind.Her commitment to good health and good living is one that we should all strive for."
3,ok,This book is okay but I got bored before the end of the book. She is sweet and I probably just chose to read it at the wrong time in my own life.
4,both husband and wife are great authors,"dr phils wife is also a great author, like her husband. i have read almost all of dr phils books and his wife's book is another excellent read."
5,Inside my heart: Choosing to live with Passion and Purpose,I thought this book was excellent. I love Robin McGraw and her values and she really put things into perspective. I recently lost my brother and this book has made a difference in the healing process
1,Bad shape,"Wish I could take a picture so you could understand. pages are falling out and the bindings all broken a few pages are falling out, made sure all pages still in book.. Outside cover is dirty. Positive: pages have no marks or high lighter marks. I don't recommend. Very very poor customer service ...if you need to return expect a hassle ...bummed out!"
3,Not the greatest purchase,"I did not see any info about this pot not working on a flat top stove before I purchased it. The literature that came with the pot said it may not work on a flat top stove, and to check with the owners manual to see if it is the type that doesn't work on flat tops. I never received an owners manual, only a ""how to care for your pot"" guide. So when I began to boil water in it the pot began to shake and roll in a circular pattern and the water sloshed out. The only way to stop it was to literally hold the handles the entire time!"
1,Not what I expected!,"This Revere 1400 Line is very light-weight with lids that don't fit. The bottom surfaces aren't flat, and the pans wobble on my glass top range. Steam escapes because the lids are very loose. After boiling water in the pans, spots appeared on the inside surface. I thought this could be the last set of pots and pans I bought, but that's not the case. Revere should be ashamed of the quality of these pans manufactured in Indonesia."
2,Disappointed w/Revereware,"We have purchased Revereware in the past and have always been satisfied with their pots, UNTIL this last purchase. The pots weren't as heavy and were NOT made in the USA like the previous pots we have bought. You can pull on these pots and see how flimsy they actually are. I am verydisappointed with Revereware"
2,Critique,I was disapointed in this product. It is made of steel of a lesser gauge. It is thinner.One of the pots was 1/2 pound lighter than my original same size pot made in USA.
1,Disappointed,"Got my first set over thirty years ago...... around 5 years ago bought new pans after watching all the cooking shows. Decided on the new Revere...made in China... poor choice ..... the smallest sauce pan now has a bubble on the bottom of the copper, I have no idea how it happened. Only that this set cost a whole lot more than my old wedding set and it didn't last. I'm looking at another brand something made here in the states."
3,"""Almost Revereware""","I am quite disappointed with these pans. I grew up with Revereware, so I was thrilled when I found them available on Amazon. They seem to be only half as heavy as the old pans (I still have one) - they are like an aluminum beer can compared to an older tin one; they feel as if they'll melt at first use. In fact one of them almost did. These are a poor rendition of an old friend."
1,Revere Ware Skillets Don't Stand Up,"I bought a set of Revere Ware cookware, pots and pans and skillets about six years ago. The pots and pans were superb, and held up fine, cleaning up perfectly, inside and out, after each use. The seven-inch skillet and the ten-inch skillets were an entirely different story. They both developed severe scratches inside--despite using non-abrasive cleaning products--and developed ugly burn-marks and unsightly stains on the outside that became nearly impossible to clean off. I had to finally give up on both of them, and pitch them in the trash. Revere is a fine old name, but its non-stick skillets degrade, rather than exalt, its fine name. I would never buy any of their skillets again."
2,1980-1990 Vintage Revere,"Hi,Some of our Revere pieces are 30 years old, so I was thinking of a new set, but based upon the reviews, I will treasure my current set. It has served us well and keeps on going.There is quality out there, you just need to look for it and pay the price. I purchased the large (14""x17"")All-clad cookie sheet in stainless last month and it is excellent, but it was expensive, $80! This was probably our fifth cookie sheet, and everything before this one rusted. This one should be our last. This should have been my first cookie sheet.So for baking, I just stick with a good stainless steel, adding one piece at a time, including some from the Vermont Country Store. Cheap stainless steel rusts. The non-stick products have to be replaced in 3-10 years. I think it is cheaper just to buy a good stainless product to begin with and not waste money on the stuff that does not last. I have a few baking pieces I have not found in a good stainless yet."
2,Here are the sizes included,"If it bugs you that you can't even tell what sizes these pans are, then here is what you get in this package: 1 qt saucepan, 1 1/2 qt saucepan, 4 1/2 qt. pot, and 9 inch skillet. So the saucepans are probably smaller than you expected. I had to go back and get a 2 and a 3 quart saucepan, which is the size I use most.BTW everything they say about how thin the metal is is true. Sad reflection on quality."
2,Not Your Mother's Revere Ware,I was shocked at how thin the sides and bottoms of these pots and pans are. You can actually push them in and out with your fingers. They weigh less than 1/2 of the weight of some Revere Ware pots and pans I purchased in the 1980's. They are easily dented they are so thin. Made in Indonesia? I would recommend buying another brand since these are not your mother's Revere Ware that lasted for generations.
2,Don't waste your time,"The thickness on this cookware is extremely thin. The frying pan hears up very quickly and unevenly. It also warped after only a few uses. The sauce pans are decent and I use them often, but I had to throw the soup pot out after it started corroding. The set as a whole is not good. I'd recommend just getting the small pots separately."
2,Revere Ware - Waste of Brand,"I have Revere Ware for over 20 years, 3 sauce pans, a frying pan, and a Kettle, and had been pleased. I burnt one sauce pan, and they even replaced it even though it was my fault--and thus generated a lot of good will.My old Revere Ware are all as new. Now I am seeking a 4 quart pot and naturally looking for Revere Ware--a Brand I trusted. But reading all the reviews it seems that quality has gone down considerably. A shame, but this is the trend--brand erosion. There are so many other choices. Too bad. Why so many companies do that does not make sense--even with All Clad--once made in China and elsewhere, product quality goes down--to save costs, yes, but dilute the quality and the brand. How does that make sense?"
1,copper bottom disappeared after first use,After the first use the copper bottom disappeared on two of the four pieces as if it were sprayed on. I guess it is the aluminium bottom and stainless steel insides that are left.
1,Very sad how this product is working out !,"I purchased some new Revere pots and pans for myself for Christmas and lets just say Im really disappointed.My frying pan is warped and burnt already , and the other pans are warped and you can see the burner rings on the bottom of the pans.These are brand new pans but the pans my mother used to use (back in the day) lasted forever.Why are the new ones so cheap and horrible>"
3,Exploding glass lid,"January 10, 2013.While cooking an expensive dinner with the 12"" electric revere ware skillet and about 1 minute into the process, the glass lid simply exploded and shattered into a thousand pieces.This is a safety hazard in the kitchen when using this product and the item should be recalled. Not to mention my lobster dinner was ruined. How can I get a replacement lid?Besides, I still love my electric skillet?"
1,Horrible and not authentic Revere,"Don't buy these pans. I bought four boxes for Christmas gifts, thinking they were like the ones I currently own. They can only be used one time, after one use they are junk! I simmered sauce for a few hours in the large pan and four corners cracked. The frying pan browns on one side and doens't cook on the other. Mine are made in Illinoise these are made in Indodesia. I paid to have them shipped, had I known they were not Revere I would never have bought them. I asked to return them and was told I needed to pay for the return shipping. I sent mine back and it cost $12.88. I asked the company to contact me and they have never contacted me about the returns or even apoligized for selling them to me."
5,A Very Moving Book!!,"This book is very moving, I cried!! You will treasure this book forever!! Recommended for ages 10-14. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did!"
5,"Murder mystery, Red Skelton style",Red plays a radio actor/writer who does a weekly murder mystery radio show. Coming up with near perfect crimes for his radiocharacter to solve. But he is kidnapped by the mob. They want him to plan perfect murders for them that they will actually carry out.It`s a laugh a minute as Red`s cowardly character tries to keep his own skin intact and escape with same without becoming involvedin a real murder.
3,"Fairly standard, some bright moments","I'm not a big fan of the ""Native American meets white woman"" genre, but as far as this genre goes, Sherri Whitefeather writes well. According to her blurb, Sherri herself is married to a Native American, so at least she has some measure of experience and authenticity in white woman/Native American man relationships.I never quite adjusted to the idea that Melanie, a woman who was in love with the hero Colt Raintree, would offer to be his surrogate on the grounds of trying to fall in love with him. By all accounts, surrogacy is a messy and difficult medical based process, none of which is even hinted at in this book. Obviously they only try insemination once before moving onto the real thing, but still. Melanie also admits that she could never give Colt the baby very early into her pregnancy, so it all seems a bit odd.Overall: wonderful sex scenes, great dialogue but a clunky and difficult premise that ultimately proves to be unsatisfying and a bit forced."
3,Tight Beats Weak Lyrics,"Over all the beats are tight. knightowls lyrics are weak though. Ive Heard alot of his music and sometimes he blends the same words over and over in different songs just in different ways. He is not a good lyricist and should not be rapping. The cds O.K. He doesnt compare any where to Mos Def, Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem. Now they can rap! THERE IS ALOT OF GOOD LATIN RAP BUT THIS ISNT IT!"
3,not the batman I enjoy,"Maybe it's just the more recent Batman comics, but it seems like any Batman volume I pick up is depressing. This book is especially dark and depressing. I can handle a dark, brooding, crime-fighting Batman, but the Batman in this volume is just obsessed to the point of danger. He refuses to see anything but his own point of view. He won't even consider another point of view, because he believes that his view of the world is less biased than anyone else's. He is not an enjoyable character.In this book, he is hunting a woman who, as part of a protest against Wayne Enterprises, set off a bomb several years before that killed a lot of people. Batman turns hunting her into his own crusade, partially because of the deaths and partially because, it seems, his ego is continually hurt by the fact that she eludes him for so long. The artwork looks lovely, but I just can't like the story. I haven't read a lot of Batman comics, but this doesn't seem like a prime example of them."
2,Good for travel,"I bought this for a plane ride to occupy my 15 month old daughter. Since the pieces can't be lost, it served its purpose and worked well for travel. Unfortunately, it didn't hold her interest and looks a bit cheap. The concept is great, but think the coloring and material used for the front could be improved."
4,A GOOD CHOICE,"Tables are attractive and sturdy - could be improved if table locked in position, this could prevent spills by children"
2,NOT sturdy at all!,"I ordered the tables having read the reviews and all of them said the tables are sturdy. However, the ones that we got are NOT sturdy at all - they shake like thin, light wood tables that are not put together well. When we looked at the legs, they are standing just on little tips, so my spouse and I are now thinking of either cutting the legs a little so that they will stand flat, or somehow otherwise reinforcing the tables. In addition, one leg for the stand was broken.Otherwise, I do love the color and size of the tables, but, again, they are almost useless unless reinforced. What a pity!"
3,Not Quite As Good As Some Wrote,"The majority of the reviews described this product as solid with a high quality surface. I researched this product on several sites including Winsome and was convinced this would be a quality set of wood TV tables, maybe as good as can be found. However, after receiving, I can't support that. These were no better than any TV tables I've purchased in the past. In particular, each table surface was blemished to some extent. One table was quite bad. Given that returning would be a hassle and cost me for the shipping fee, I chose to use my wood repair pens to cover the flaws the best I could. There couldn't be any quality control prior to packaging. The blemishes were not caused by shipping or packaging. Little care was taken to make sure that there were no scratches or indentations. Thank goodness I only spent $79.00. On some other sites these exact same tables ran as high as $159.00."
2,Poor quality finish,"I ordered these table trays as a Christmas gift for my mom. When the trays came in the mail, we noticed that three of the four trays had bad finish. There were patches where the finish was rough, and it was not in the same places on each tray. I contacted the seller and their solution was to send another set of TV trays (only after me needing to send a detailed e-mail about what what wrong with their product). The replacement set was on back order and took a few weeks to reach my mom. When she opened the new set of trays, she discovered that they were pretty much the same as the first set -- one tray with a good finish, and three that had rough patches of finish. Ultimately we returned both sets (which took a week to get the labels, and two to get the refund) and purchased the product elsewhere."
2,Poor Quality Item,The finish was of poor quality and the wood had splits in the surface. The item was unacceptable and returned.
4,"Solid wood, Made in Thailand, finish has issues","We were pleased to see that the product was made in Thailand and NOT china as some of the other reviews mentioned. By reading the reviews, it looks like the manufacturer has some production in China and Thailand and the people who got the ones made in China has trouble with the wood being too soft and the screws were stripping the wood. This likely means that the Chinese factory didn't use Beech like they were suppose to and used Pine (or similar) instead. Our were Beech wood and I could not easily dent them and we had no difficultly with the screws. My only complaint is that the finish on them isn't very nice and isn't even in places but if we wanted to we could always re-finish them. Bottom line is that is was cheaper for us to buy them than make them so we are happy that we got them."
3,I need something more solid,"Thought about returning it, but will ultimately keep it because I eventually want more for the home. I can use these as stands later. Wish it was made of a wood that was a bit more solid which may mean that I may need to buy something in person or be prepared for more expensive shipping.The person that put the storage unit together didn't seem to have trouble."
5,joe,"The only knock on the trays is, I had hoped they were a bit larger. The 5PC TV Tray Tables with stand are nice and heavy, and the quality is very good."
4,very sturdy and strong,"I bought two sets of these tables. One for myself and one for my father. They arrived and you have to put the tray stand together but it was very simple. They are a beautiful color and i love the rounded edges. My only complaint is that they are a little heavy, but its worth it for how sturdy they are. If you are looking for light easy to use tray tables then these aren't for you. Other wise, great tables!"
5,Great product,"Yes, it's a tad pricey, or at least it seemed so to me. But I knew the wife would really like them so hated to say no. I've got to say, these are ENTIRELY worth the money. Very good quality in the build, heavy duty, easy to assemble the stand, a very good value."
5,Happy,"Not bad at all for the price. Well packaged. Sturdy too. A minor blemish or two, but with a spray with furniture polish, looks very nice for my purposes."
3,Cheap tray tables,"Very flemsey construction. Was very disapointed in the quaility. compared to similarily priced tray tables we had previously purchased. They will do the job for awhile, so not a total waste of money."
3,A little cheaper than expected,"I knew they were 'affordable' but they are a bit flimsier than I would have hoped for. Overall a set of 4 at this price was decent since we don't use them a lot, once a week, family movie night. But if you use TV trays like 3+ times a week, these are not for you."
4,Pleased--But........,"Love the set, finish & color is great, assembly of stand easy....but the bottom screws were too long to use, had to find right size in my tool box so only gave a 4 star."
1,Very poorly made table.,"I got these tables for my apartment to use for storage, and let me say, I cannot recommend these tables at all. I had one by my computer desk, where I would store some papers, magazines, and cups, you know, normal things to store. Anyway, with absolutely no provocation, the leg on the desk broke. Literally, I cleaned off the desk, put my laptop computer on it, went to plug it in, and the thing fell off because that action cause the leg to break.Now, I may be an unreasonable man, but I expect that a table can withstand some light provocation. The leg literally snapped right in the middle. It may be too late to return these tables, but I will simply say I will not buy a Winsome product ever again, and I would suggest you do the same."
5,VERY HAPPY WITH TABLES!!!!,I was very pleased with the wooden tables they are a dark walnut finish which is exactly what I wanted. My husband was even impressed with the solid construction of the TV tables; and he is a carpenter by trade. They are larger than any other TV table I have seen.
2,Disappointing as pictured or described,"The tv trays are NOT walnut. They are a rough oakish finish, not like they appear in the photograph - much lighter. They have lots of imperfections in the wood and really need to have a coat of finish or oil stain applied to improve their appearance. The stand came disassembled without any instructions about how to put it together and no picture about what it should look like. I had to go back to the website to see what I should do with the pieces and that is when I discovered how different the item I received looks from what I thought I had ordered. VERY disappointing!"
3,THIS PRODUCT WAS JUST OKAY!!!,"The finish is just okay, there were several spots that were marred & needed touch up, the marring was not done in shipping,several were in the center where the finish did not take."
2,TV Tables,"The style and design of the tables is very nice. I like itHowever, the packaging was not great, on each of the 4 tables there are noticable scratches and gouges in the table tops. Each table was covered with a plastic bag. No bubble wrap. it seems they were not packed for shipping.Disappointing to get the tables damaged."
3,Finished Poorly,"One tray was unfinished along one edge and one was unfinished in spots as thought it was applied too light. Neither of us were very happy with these but we used two as we had company and needed eating surfaces for 10, 8 at dining room table and two watching football while they ate. Poor job of finishing and blind was the inspector. Will refinish the two myself and be sure to never use that vendor again."
3,"Nice, but had some scratches","Ordered these TV tables for a Christmas gift. 3 of the tables and the table holder are great! Beautiful! One table however, has 2 big scratches/discolorations in the wood. These are right on the top where everyone can see them. Disappointed in that."
2,Not as good. As I expected.,For the money I did not think the quality was good enough...just not substantial construction. The old standby set from Walmart is better made.
3,Not worth the price I paid,"I purchased these trays according to the previous reviews. I thought that spending over $75 for a set of tv tables would guarantee me a quality product, but I was wrong. What a disappointment. 2 of the tables had spots where the varnish was peeling off and there were a few small gouges in some of the wood pieces. I didn't send them back because I didn't want to take everything apart and pay for shipping."
4,very good product,"These tv trays are a very substantial tray, much more sturdy than the ones we had before. The wood grain makes them a bit elegant. I did not have the problems with them collapsing when in use that others have had. They are a little bit harder to set up than some I have used, but not enough to worry over."
1,BIG Disappointment!,"We bought these tables in December 2011. First off, the legs are not as pictured. They taper down to a sharp point so they leave marks on hard surfaces and are hard to move on any surface. Within three months we noticed that the legs were getting wobbly and unstable. Upon investigation of the problem I found that the folding leg assembly is constructed with a very ameteur version of a mortise & tenon joint. The joint is SO loose that no amount of glue can hold it together. The joints are held together by small brads and that's it. You might as well throw your money away than buy these. they are GARBAGE!"
1,We will use them..........but.....,"Poor design makes it almost impossible to finish assembling and to open/close without coming apart again! They look nice, but would not recommend"
1,DO NOT BUY THESE. THEY ARE HORRIBLE QUALITY.,"I ordered these tables as a christmas present for my brother. The color is beautiful however the first time I received them the box was slightly damaged which is fine. I opened them and one of the tables the finished was rubbed off and the second table had huge raised chunks of wood. I didn't even bother to look at the other two because the situation was already ridiculous. Although the color was very nice, they honestly looked like someone took a piece of plywood and stained it. They feel very cheap.I returned them and received new ones within three days. Very good service. However, the second time i received them the entire side of the box was ripped open and had been re-taped as if someone had bought them and returned them as well. The first two tables I took out of the box had dents again. They were not as big this time but I am not going to settle for subpar product when i've already had issues."
5,Great addition to the series,"""Code Name Cassandra"" is an excellent edition to the 1-800-WHERE-R-U series.Jess Mastriani is back again for a 2nd installment about her strange life. After being hit by lightning in the last book Jess was able to locate missing children, she was taken to an FBI station and forced to stay there until she escaped. Now everyone thinks she doesn't have her powers anymore. But she has a secret, her psychic ability is still there.A man approaches Jess as she's working at a summer camp for musically gifted children. He wants her to find his daughter. She'd love to but then the feds will know she still has her powers, but she does what she knows she has to do. Jess is on the case, and now not only does she have the FBI on her trail again, she now has the girls stepfather on her back who wants her dead.This is an excellent book, and I recommend it to any fan of Jenny Carroll, and fans of paranormal phenomena."
5,The best in the series so far,I'm only working on the third but this one was totally interesting and suspensful. I loved it and I litterally thought Jess would die!
3,Pleasantly Suprising,"I started with the Mediator books and liked them well enough to try Jenny Carroll's other paranormal series, 1-800-Where-R-You and was pleasantly suprised to discover that I liked them better, maybe because Jess appeals to me more. Gifted with unwanted psychic abilities, something of a tom-boy with ""anger-management"" issues, she seemed much more believable than Suze the mediator.Certainly not great literature, but Code Named Cassandra offers a fast-paced story, appealing characters and humor. Trying to lie low Jessica takes a job as a counselor for gifted child musicians. Unfortunately no one who knows who ""lightening girl"" is wants to leave her alone. Hounded by incompetent FBI agents and a desperate father looking for his daughter, Jess is just trying to survive a cabin full of bratty boy campers and maybe get her sort-of-not boyfriend Rob to call her. A fun, fast-paced book to pass a winter day."
3,Heavy-Handed Editorializing?,"Jeez, could the editorial review at least pretend to suppress their bias towards pro-British interpretation of the history?"
4,A very good book,"I enjoyed FDR's Folly, and due to a gift certificate I got this book, Wilson's war. I like Powell's iconoclastic look at some venerated icons such as FDR and Wilson, and this book is no different--he clearly thinks that Wilson was a terrible president and was directly responsible for WWII and Hitler. He gives very good reasons for this and buttresses his thesis with extensive references. It's also a great source of information about Hitler and Lenin/Stalin.I thought that the book was hard to follow in places, and this was mainly because he took the contents by theme rather than chronologically. That's fine, but I kept losing track of names, and had to backtrack to get the information.Still, it's a fine book, and I highly recommend it."
3,Where are my brands?,"While this book is very helpful for anyone following an exchange-based dietary plan, many of the brands listed are unfamiliar to me. I assume they are regional. In addition, the most commonly used brands in my region are often missing from the book. That means I need to compare nutritional facts from each label with the products listed and make a note for the future. That's more work than I usually want to take on. However, this is a still a helpful book for my meal planning."
3,David Boreanaz by Chris Nickson,"This was a very average book for those who know anything about David Boreanaz. The book focused more on the BtVS series than it did on David himself. Most of the information presented could be found in various magazines and articles and, as indicated by the bibliography, probably was. Chris Nickson had a tendency to repeat several comments and/or opinions during the book, this became a bit too repetitive for me. Overall.... average for an David Boreanaz fan but a good starting point for the new comer."
1,This is a terrible product,Plain and Simple: This product is terrible if you live in an apartment building in a city. I bought $5 rabbit ears that worked 100 times better.
1,Review of RCA ANT501 UHF/VHF/FM Amplified Indoor Antenna,Conventional rabbit ears with aluminum foil worked better! Save your money!
3,"It should have been called, 'The Three Dollar' League...","In Anti-Trust cases, the 'winner' (inthis case we have to '-' the word winner!)gets the award tripled! For a guy who cl-aims to have been such an insider, Byrnemisses quite a bit (I had two tryouts w/the USFL after being a college P/H). Butoverall it's worth getting if you don'thave to pay an arm and hoof to get it.There are also several great websitesdedicated to the memory of the USFL.Check them out!"
3,Worth about a dollar used,"This is not really a sports book but a book on the business side of sports. Nothing wrong with that but it's not until year three of the USFL that the author writes anything of note about on-field play.DO NOT waste over $100 on a used copy of this as it's waaaay too long, in need of serious editing and can be found in any large library.The worst thing is I had to go online to find out why the jury awarded the USFL only a dollar in the anti-trust lawsuit they won over the NFL. I mean, why was the author unable to explain that when it was the title of the danged book?"
4,Good Game,Uses strategy and geometry to return runaway sheep to the pen. Can be played cooperatively or cut-throat style. I recommend it for grade 1 and up.
4,Humpback Whale that sinks,This whale is bold black and white with flexible fins. I bought this for the tub and was disappointed that it sits on the bottom it does not float at all. The good part like all Safari Ltd. toys they have the animal names on the bottom so if you are learning their names you have a reminder. If you want great whales that float Schleich are beautiful in color and do float which I find important for a tub toy! Overall it is a good toy as long as you don't expect it to float!
5,the toy is a good size,"the toy was delivered very fast,is a very good size,I am happy with it and my son loves his whale,I recommend this toy.It can also be very educational for young kids who like to ask questions."
3,nice watch,"I'm generally happy with this watch. There are two small things that I don't like about it. First, I wish the glass covering the face was flat. I was surprised to see the it bulges a bit (kind of like the difference btwn a flat-screen TV and the traditional kind of TV screen). Also, the outside of the clasp sometimes gets caught on my hair (my head hair, that is, when my wrist ends up brushing past my head)."
3,Too confrontational for many situations,"This is a good book, as far as it goes. But it's very confrontational. What about something for people in low-level situations, or who prefer an effective but low-key approach? Not everyone is as gutsy as the author."
3,THIS MIGHT NOT BE WHAT YOU THINK IT IS,"ITS COPPER PLATED,NOT THE CHEFS REQUEST LINE,STAINLESS STEEL WITH COPPER ENCAPSULATED TRI PLY BOTTOM.WHOLE DIFFERENT CREATURE.ITS STILL A NICE CHRISTMAS THING,DIMENSIONALLY BIGGER THAN ANYSKILLET YOU PROBABLY GOT.HAVEN'T COOKED WITH IT YET,BUT HAD TO REPLY FOR THOSE LOOKING DURING THIS BUSY TIME.REVERE IS PART OF CORNING SO TO GET BETTER YA GOTTA SEE THE DIFFERENCE AT WALLMARTAND CALL THE COMPANY TA FIND A FACTORY OUTLET.IF THEY HAVE BETTER...."
5,Great reference,"I first encountered this book when I was in middle school and was in the library for a research project, and the one thing about it I always hated was it was a reference book - I couldn't check it out! Then, when I found it in a bookstore, I was only making babysitters wages and couldn't exactly shell out the $75+ I remember it cost. Finally, when I made enough money to buy it, it was out of print!Thankfully, I found it online and I have been extremely pleased with the purchase. This book has inspired a lasting fascination with human psychology and the effect of fear. I recommend it for anyone who hopes to gain a greater insight to the human psyche."
5,A great resource on fear,"As a psychologist specializing in treating fears and phobias, I found this book really interesting. The author is highly acclaimed in psychological circles to do with anxiety. The book is unique in that it could be used both by therapists and the general public. It's easy to read style and also being set out in a simple alphabetical format, would be helpful in diagnosing patients, and also make for great read for the everyday person in understanding more about the amazing world of fears and phobias, a topic that affects us all.Anthony Gunn, psychologist and author ofFear Is Power: Turn Your Fears Into Success"
3,Hate the little dust brush,This little dust brush is wedge shaped & the intake hole is so small that the bristles fold in upon themselves then clog up the brush. Absolutely needs to be redesigned
2,Too much buck for too little bang!,"This book covers the bare minimum for an upper-division course on classical mechanics. It's not much different from other standard texts at this level, however for its price it should come with a personal tutor and a complimentary spa treatment. My biggest beef with this book is that for more than twice the cost (about 3x's if you go by the original price tag of $232.95) of a book like Taylor's it covers almost half as many topics (however I concede that the binding is quite poor on Taylor's book). Its sad that this text stops at Langrangian mechanics and doesn't even offer even a section in that chapter (let alone a separate chapter) on Hamiltonian mechanics."
3,Meh at best,"This book has some interesting commentary at the start of every chapter which gives nice perspective, but the teaching is lacking. The derivations tend to go on and on without much interpretation or explanation, which can leave some confused. The book does not sum up concepts, formulas, or theorems, which can make this a VERY difficult book to study from. Good luck... Hope you have a good teacher.It's not all bad, but the bad parts are... bad."
2,Not a good book,"This book seems to skip steps that would have help the reader understand the material better. I had to use another book as a reference which made everything make more sense.It is also very unorganized because of the squeezing of everything into this small sized book. Sections can start right at the bottom of the page. Diagrams and examples are often not on the same page making you flip the pages back and forth 200 times.This book is a no no for beginners as it is very uncomfortable to read and same goes for the information in it, just throwing stuff at you as if you knew it already.Bad book=headache"
3,Advanced,"I took a course in my sophomore year that used this text. While it wasn't an impossible read, it was a big jump in difficulty from any freshman physics books I've used. I would think it would probably be better suited for junior year.My biggest complaint is that the amount of answers to the practice problems is relatively few. I find that the best way to learn physics is to do lots of problems, but it's nice to be able to check one's work."
5,Donkey Kong Jungle Beat,"Donkey Kong Jungle Beat is a great videogame anyone can enjoy. It blends music, beat, rythm, and adventure into one small disc. The people at Nintendo have really done a good job with this addition to the Donkey Kong series. The play style is amazing and the boss fights are done perfectly. If you've enjoyed other Donkey Kong games including Donkey Konga, it is certain that you will enjoy this. You can play the game using a normal controller, but I would recommend the D.K. Bongos if you want the full experience. Donkey Kong Jjungle Beat is a great game to add to your collection, and for a good price even including the D.K. Bongos."
4,Great game!,I bought this for my kids & they love it! I myself am not one to play video games but I find this one hard to put down.
4,Great Game and Great Price,"We got this whole package from Amazon for $19.99. That included the game and the bongos. It is a very fun game (a tad childish, but still fun)."
4,Big hit at Christmas!,My kids thoroughly enjoyed receiving this game at Christmas. It has been one they have played with regularly ever since.
3,I give this game a so-so rating,"This game is so-so. It is very very short for good gamers. I almost finished it in one day. Another thing is that it is hard to control it with the bongos. Since you can play it with the controller I tried that. It did not help one bit, infact it made it worse. So I give this game a so-so rating, and I think before you buy this game try to rent it first."
3,I can hear the lead sheets rustling...,"Well, look...Hines is incredible, but if he's gonna play like this, I'd rather hear him play ""I've Got the World on a String"". The only thing very Ellingtonian about this CD is the fact that Hines belongs more-or-less to the same generation as Duke. He treats every composition as a simple ""head""; he doesn't find any orchestrational specificity in any of the pieces - they all are treated basically the same. There are many Hines CD's with more to offer than this one. In fact, I consider this one of the most overrated discs of all time. I feel like critics have rated it based on the idea. I can't believe they really listened to it. Why isn't Quintessential on Ciaroscuro reissued? That's a masterpiece."
4,Managerial Accounting,The book is laid out very well and easy to read. I actually had to go buy the book from a local used book store because the seller took over two weeks to get it to me and my class had already started. The book I got from the seller wasn't in as good of a condition as I thought it would be. The one I got from our local store was like new and cost the same price.
1,Not as represented,This book was very damaged and has student's notes throughout the book; in some cases making it hard to read the problems. I think I was overcharged for such poor condition.
1,No solutions... How are you supposed to check your progress?,"This book is good about listing the objectives and showing you exactly where to find the answers for the multiple choice questions. For example: What is the purpose of a job cost sheet? The book highlights the area where the answer is. Easy huh? Well, what about the actual accounting problems? The detailed problems at the end of each chapter have NO SOLUTIONS to them, and you can't buy a solutions guide unless you are an instructor! I'm not an accounting wizard, so I have to actually practice before it sticks in my brain... imagine that. I guess they expect everyone to see the problems and read about the problems and automatically get it. They work out a ""Demonstration Problem"" for you, but that only applies to some of the problems at the end of each chapter."
4,awesome aussie stuff,A great collection of titles from a cool down to earth group. You americans haven't heard much of them but paying a little extra should be worth it.
3,Slighly Odway it isnt,"New album cover, extra tracks??? was the US label trying for an EMO look for the band?????, great cd but not as good as their Debut 'slightly odway'"
4,"Surely, a book for the class and not the mass...","The book has such a divine feel to it, that to label it just as another book of inspirational fiction would be to undervalue it. It not only speaks to your mind, it touches and refreshes your soul as you turn open the breeze of the few pages it is made of. The aura of the book is so mysteriously positive, you wonder why it offers u solace even when u r still looking for answers of life it contains deep down! I think the answer to this is pretty obvious: ""because it contains the answers of life!""If u really r comfortable diving in its depth, the book is for you. But, how many of us really care for depths? Only those who r sure depth contains pearls of wisdom! Or say, really few. Only a class. But this much is sure, the class will find in this book, a masterpiece like never before...!!"
5,Cocktails with joey,"FAbulous, I listen to it all the time. Sensual and sensational lounge music. Makes you want to dance, I would recommend for a relaxing time"
3,Mixed reactions,"A puzzling little piece, so chopped up, so cliche-ridden, with such bad into-English dubbing and such poor picture quality that at times it's hard to follow, but for some reason I can't really pin down, it held my interest to the end. I expect it was the nostalgia of every bad European sf film of the 60s-70s that I ever saw, rolled into one. I wouldn't say it was a quality film - quite the reverse - but it was entertaining in its way."
1,¿Cómo se atrevió este tipo a escribir esta novela tan mala?,"La historia mediocre, predecible y idiota del padre muerto de sífilis y el hijo enamorado de los pechos de su nodriza es tan pobre y falta de valor que casi me da arcadas pensar en lo que me costó acabar este libro¡Es incomprensible, para mí que este autor le pueda gustar a alguien! Lo acabé sólo para convencerme a mí mismo que no estaba equivocado al pensar que un autor de tanto renombre podria ser tan malo despues de un par de intentos vomitivos de leer otros libros suyos."
5,New insights into the Big Band,"McNeely is one of several ""young"" composer/arrangers breathing new life into the big band. McNeely's works on this album show the many facets of a great composer, from witty to serious to cerebral. Check out the liner notes to the title track, ""Lickety Split"", which say ""This piece is the result of a 'What if?' proposition. What if the baritone saxophone player in James Brown's band started to o.d. on Woody Shaw, Sun Ra, and Witold Lutoslawski?"" You get the picture? The Vanguard Band is one of the finest groups together and they bring a great loose swing to McNeely's difficult(!) tunes. A pleasure!"
4,great soloists and arranging,"this is worth more than the price of admission so check this out for some great arranging and terrific compositions, wonderful soloists in the best tradition of this band. leading edge as far as i'm concerned."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this product, as opposed to other similar ones, because of the other reviews/ratings. I thought it was going to be like the Colorforms toys we played with as kids. Instead, the pieces are black and white, very tiny, and hard to stick/unstick. I know it says everything is proportioned but some of the chairs are nearly as large as the fireplace. After trying for about an hour to arrange a single room using this product, I gave up."
4,Big help!,"I received the item on time in the condition I expected. It's already been a huge help in creating floor plans, and I know it will keep us from making some big planning mistakes. My one issue is that the vinyl clings do not cling quite as well as I'd hoped. However, I would definitely order the product again regardless of that. It's beyond useful!"
3,Utilitarian,"This set came in handy for a client of mine who did not want to wait for drawings. My client had been in the construction field for 30 years and was newly retired, he knew what he wanted and used the stickers as a basic shopping list for me. We basically came up with a great floorplan over dinner! This set comes with several sheets of modern iconic funishings, fixtures and symbols sticker sheets. The stickum on the back was not very tacky and we used additional glue with it. For the price, it is what it is. Fun and quaint. We had a great time using it together! P.S. It comes with a nice floor plan grid."
5,Great Tool,I purchased this for my interior design class. This has proven to be a great asset for furniture placement. The templetes are reuseable
5,Perfect Design Tool,"I was designing on paper when I found this product. It's perfect for planning a new home or addition. Since you tend to put in solid walls without windows on the first pass, there aren't enough wall pieces, but this was a small problem in comparison to the benefits of a peel and stick method to arrange and rearrange walls, doors and furniture. The furniture really helped me to visualize the spaces. I ended up ordering a second one to do up my final plan for the draftsperson as I had pretty well worn out the pieces by the time my design was finished. Even buying two, it's still well worth it!!"
5,"LOVE, love, love this product!","It arrived last night and i couldn't wait to get started. I already had a mock floor plan etched out on paper, so when it came in the hard work was done. This took my simple graph and made it so impressive. It also reveiled the major errors in my original plans. It explains things like stairs and such. I realize that I had too many steps and they took up much more space than necessary. Also things like the thickness of the walls, its hard to take that into account on paper. It also gives ideas for small bathrooms and closet space. It talks about the minimum width you need for hallways.I would recommend this to anyone who is ocd...lol. the only thing annoying is it has many kitchen tables, several are the same exact size which doesn't make sense. Why would I have two kitchen table of the same size. But only one queen size bed when most people have at least 2 bedrooms with queen size beds. But this is a very minor detail. But like I already stated, I'm OCD!"
2,If you have the time....,"Great idea, but the scale to so small, and the images so flimsey, it becomes very tedious. You're better off with a pencil and graph paper"
2,All right for some things,"I got this from my husband for my birthday and I was very excited, but once I got to working with the kit I could not finish my project because there were not enough of the wall strips. So if you are doing a large plan this kit may not be what you need without purchasing additional kits, but if you are doing a small plan or single room remodels its fine."
3,A fun sticky book,This book was not as helpful as I would have liked. I was just remodeling my home and I wasn't sure were all the walls would be. I had different furniture and appliance.
1,deep-sixed,i was moving and thought this would help with arranging furniture ....... didn't work for me though and i ended up tossing the item
3,Snapshot Design,"The product usage was very simple. The two problems I had were: with even using clean hands or tweezers to place furniture shapes, ""stick residue"" rubbed off on some of the shapes. This force me to use double tape to hold in place. The table and cabinet sizes are limited. I ended up creating the size needed by using two or more of different sizes that were available. Would I purchase this item again? Probably only if the price went down because of what you get."
2,Not much choice in a field that's controversial,"This is one of the many books I've consulted about candida, and every single expert disagrees with the other. Some say you can't have whole wheat, others say it's okay. Some say mushrooms are taboo, others say you can have them in moderation. The only thing anyone can agree on is no sugar. I found this book unnecessarily restrictive. When I consulted my doctor in frustration, she handed me a candida diet that allowed many more foods than this book would have deemed okay.Also, I don't know why natural sweeteners like stevia weren't included in this book. Stevia has made my life much easier--and it actually battles candida also.I'd advise against this book unless you like feeling reined in. Having to eat like this is just going to encourage cheating, and what good is that?"
3,OK book,"This book tells you not to eat any type of sugars, dairy products (except butter) and of course no cheese, nothing made with vinegar, like for example catsup, mustard (look on back to see if any vinegar, anything with vinegar is a no no )or mayo ( a homemade mayo recipe is provided), no fruits of any kind, no fruit juices, no baked products (like bread, eventhough I believe you can buy bread without yeast at a health food store), no biscuits, pancake mixes,candy, sodas, no mushrooms, tea, coffee & spices can have mold, vitamins that are yeast grown, no malt (most breakfast cereals contain malt), no beer or ale or malt liquor. It also says that garlic is antifungal so do cook with garlic and that you can benefit from Pau D'arco tea. There are also recipes provided in the book, but I would say you can cook out of any cookbook just don't use above ingredients."
3,Really good recipes,"This book has really good recipes and I am excited to try them whenever my candida diet starts allowing the food choices needed for them. The methods of treating candida have changed since this book was published. The book has a great section, that is very thorough, about how to evaluate whether you have candida albicans and should seek to treat it by diet."
3,Just okay,"This book repeats the same info, over and over and over. If the editor would cut out all the duplication, the book would be about 1/3 its current size. There are some nuggets, here and there, but if I'd had a chance to browse it more completely (like you can at a book store) I would not have bought it. That's the price one pays by buying through Amazon, and considering the convenience, etc., it's usually a small price. Dont' really recommend this book one way or the other."
2,Too Repetitive. Get to the point.,"The book is very redundant.I must assume either the author is implementing the ""spiral"" she refers to in women's marketing in her writing style to better illustrate her point (for her female audience) or she expects persons to skim through the chapters to what they feel are most relevant so keeps repeating the same information in each one in case we missed it every time in the previous 7!Only about 15% of the book was insightful, some useful gems buried among the rambling, but it was too much of an excrutiating experience digging it out, I felt terribly frustrated by the time I reached chapter 8. Too much fluff, wasting paper, save our trees."
2,Someone help me please,I haven't bought or read the book.(I read Trends which I found to have no detail or market research-just cute man bashing). What I challenge anyone who has read this book is give me 10 discreet things (ok 3) that the author gives you to help market to women. I mean take back to the office and put to use things. I don't mean 'women want complexity' - more than that. What do we mean by 'complexity'? Or how do we create an online experience for a woman that increases click-thru to purchase. Do we upsell items on the first page (because that is how women prefer it)? Do we put shoes next to the business suits because women multi-task? Or??... you get the point. My take is most of her material is anecdotal- even personal opinion. I may be wrong - someone help me on this.
5,Great transaction,"I purchasd this book in ""used"" condition. I was very pleasantly surprised when I recieved it. It was in PERFECT condition. Would definately purchased from this source again!"
5,Love this book!,"Thanks, the book and the shipment went really smoothly. but Sean Russell is a genius and this particular trilogy is amazing."
4,Casual epic fantasy,"The One Kingdom was an enjoyable read. Easy to read throughout, with details on the world and characters sprinkled in to flesh it out. Water as a theme is interestingly presented throughout, and the use of water to describe things is a nice touch. The world is full of myth and the magic is a mystery, after first novel still unsure if magic is real or legend, which intrigues me. The characters are fun, and there are a lot of them. The plot moves nicely in the beginning, but later in the book feels like it is still building up, with many characters meandering on the river. Overall, nice world with realistic characters, going to read sequel."
2,"shallow plot, poor character development",Not to mention a heavy dose of redundency.So this is a story about stories...need we be reminded of that every three pages. Also the imagery to 'two rivers' AKA Jordan is tedious. The Rogue good guy? The Fael as Elves??? A mysterious dark knight. Too much reliance on fantasy cliches'It wasn't horrible but it is certainly no better then a book to read while waiting for a desired one to make it to the shelves.
2,An attempt at epic fantasy,"The One Kingdom and, more importantly, Sean Russell show for a poor outing. The book's characters are not defined and rather shallow, able to be pushed over with the slightest breeze. The plot structure is rather forced and unbelievable many times when he tries to introduce something new and magical. The book itself rambled on very slow until the end when it picked up and everything started coming together. For this I give a three star because my interest was caught at the end. But the book itself seems rather amateurish as the dialogue is forced and rather fake. But, I may just yet purchase the next one in the series if only to follow the character Alaan, who is probably the only good character in the book, and perhaps Prince Michael. Certainly not Tam, Fynnol or the others."
1,Swan's What?,"If the reader wants a book which details the relationship between the characters and a river, I would suggest that they purchase something by Mark Twain not ""The One Kingdom""From a promising beginning chapter, this book proceeds with glacial speed to an unsatisfactory ending in which the major premise is that there may be some resolution in a future volume. It manages to achieve this feat with two-dimensional characters, minimal historical context for the plot, and a lack of action notable in a volume of this length. The one bright spot is the facility that the author displays in painting a rich and vivid landscape.In summary,I could only recommend this book to someone with a long weekend to kill and nothing more interesting to do."
4,Worth your time,"I had never read anything by Sean Russell before this book, and I have to say that I am impressed. The tone is *very* similar to George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, and so this book is a fine book to read in order to whet your appetite for the next book in that series. The first 2 chapters or so were a little slow for me, but by the end of the 4th chapter I was firmly hooked and finished the whole thing up over the course of a few short days. This book is definitely worth your time!"
3,be aware!,"quite a good read once the characters are introduced, which takes up quite a portion of the book. so if you are not the patient type and like the action to come from page one you may be tested. do not plan to read this book if you want the story to be finished on the last page"
4,More Like 4-1/2 Stars,"""Danceculture 2"" is a CD I'd waited a while to get and I'm glad to report I was not disappointed. HOWEVER, the track listing on MY CD is as follows: 1. First Time (Offer's 2006 Reconstruction); 2. Musica v. El Dinero; 3. My Otherside; 4. House Is A Feeling; 5. U Know I Love It; 6. Hello?; 7. No More; 8. Craving; 9. World, Hold On; 10. He Is; 11. Underground, Baby; 12. One Hundred Percent; and 13. Lay Down.Tracy once again mixes several ""messages"" into her work: peace, love, understanding, and a ""presence"" MUCH bigger than any of us! Okay; that's today's sermon..Anyway, my favorite tracks are 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 10, but I enjoyed ALL tracks. Most tracks come in at very impressive times and that's another added plus. This CD is more in the genre of Danceculture 1, although I don't think it's quite that good. It's a close call, though.Get this one guys; you won't be disappointed!"
2,"Regrettably, an impulsive purchase","I purchased this set primarily because I was amazed that the price was so low for copper-clad construction. Well, you know the old adage...you get what you pay for. While I feel that the pans are fairly well-made for the price (handles are well-attached, nothing has fallen off or become warped), the thickness of both bottoms and walls is FAR too thin. Temperature regulation is nearly impossible, and even on the lowest flame, if I don't watch food very carefully, it scorches, burns, or boils out of control within minutes. If you love copper cookware, go with All-Clad, a very pricey but unbeatable line of cookware that will last long enough to pass down to your grandkids."
1,Not up to my expectations.,"I absolutely adore the Shinsengumi and collected a great amount of japanese movies and books about them.I also really like Toshiro Mifune movies, so when I purchased this movie, I was looking forward to watching it.Unfortunately, it was really not up to my expectations, being much inferior to his other movies, and filled with historical inconsistencies that were really annoying for a history and Shinsengumi fan.It's entertaining of course, but by far inferior to what I was expecting.If you can find the TV series Shinsengumi Keppuroku, I recommend it over this movie.His other movies remain excellent ones of course, and I recommend you watch them too if you haven't already. :)"
4,Japan World Dawn,"On a landscape of opening Japan to the outer world of the third quarter of the ninetieth century Shinsengumi clan fights throne-supportive families for own good.Blood was dropping, people were killed, young men loved women and interacted with peers by aka-Yaji and Kita - The Midnight Pilgrimsway.One must be careful to check a factual appearance of English subtitles because my copy allows improving of verbal Japanese and written Chinese only."
5,GREAT SUB,"i love this subs, it gets loud given that its only 10"". packs quite a punch, great deal for the price. looked around for a little bit before i decided to settle on these, i am one happy customer."
4,Great product Great price,We purchased this woofer to add to our Home Theater system. I read every review I could find on this. There were many good reviews and a few bad ones too. I'm an average user and I love the sound of this speaker. It performs very well with movies feel the rumble. Music sounds awesome. The price is right the sound is right and it was here in 3 days.
4,Great sound,"Have no problem with this subwoofer. Has great sound and was very easy to hook up. For it's size, it is great."
5,polk audio psw10,"like it ! great subwoofer for the price.for a mid level sub, don't waist your timelooking around, purchase this one and you'll be glad you did."
4,Awesome,The subwoofer is awesome. Only problem I found is when it's making too loud the frame is making some noise. I'm pretty sure this is a construction problem and Polk guys must correct this. Otherwise it's really awesome. I love it.
1,Quality Issues,"Second time around I tried a Polk Audio sub woofer. First one worked OK, but the amplifier went out after 18 month of sporadic use. Thought I give it another try with this one (price seems right), but it did not even work from the start. Instead of a clear rich bass, nothing but low frequency rumblings and humming. Checked different input source and wires to be sure. Sent back the same day."
4,Sub good for small speakers.,"Using these subs to match Hsu HB-1 bookshelf speakers. They are a good musical match: tuneful with fast response. Not the deepest or loudest subs around, but they add good bass to efficient bookshelf types in a small listening space. Cheap, so I bought two for reinforcement. You may need more power in a big room.I found these subs in an online review of Magnepan MG-12's. Reviewer looked hard to find subs fast enough for Maggies. These fit! That was good enough for me.Auto-switch feature is just right: 15 minute silence to switch to standby; quick restart. Pleased with purchase."
3,Selecting a subwoofer,Easy to connect...looks great. The sound comes out muffled. I traded in my acostibass from Bose for this subwoofer and I'm not sure if I did the right thing. It was recommended by the team who installed my home theater system.
4,its Decent For its Worth,I bought this to use with my new home theater system i just recently bout. i replaced a none powered sub that came with the system. with what i payed for this product its definatly worth it. for 100 bucks it has a pretty good sound.
5,"Smooth, rich, low tones","Polk Audio has always been a leader high quality audio reproduction. There are so many very high quality speaker companies to choose from, it is hard to make a decision. I have heard this sub in a store compared to other like subs. The speaker was not the loudest but defiantly the riches and smoothest in the low range. I am using this sub and JBL speakers as a second audio source for listening to mastered mixes in my recording studio. I find it accurately represents those frequencies that the JBL's are incapable. I recommend this sub for its rich smooth sound and price."
2,Not Impressed!!!,"After setting up the PSW10 with my receiver, I put it through some Blu-ray movies that have all ranges of bass. The sound wasn't too bad until you get into some pounding deep bass.. (i.e. thunder) The ported encloser makes the grill rattle and the tones of bass out of range sound aweful. The sound is hard to describe, but really kills the dynamic of the movie. If the bass stays within rage the speaker sounds pretty good.. Overall I'd suggest getting the sealed enclosure to bypass the grill rattling and garbled low tones.."
2,Weak Sub,Hooked it up with no problem. But at full power it is weak at most. If you want really good bass then buy the more expensive one.
2,You get what you pay for,"I am a longtime Polk fan, but after I purchased this sub I ended up returning it. Its a good price for sure, and to be fair there is probably nothing else that is all that much better in this price range.. But the performance just isn't there. It's not loud enough or deep enough, and lacks the presence that you expect from a home theater subwoofer. I was using it in my fairly small bedroom, and it still did not give me anywhere near the impact I was looking for. I replaced it with a 12 inch BIC sub that I found on sale for not that much more, and it hits a LOT harder."
5,Great Sub A Steal @ $ 79.00,"For those that keep saying that this Sub woofer is no good then they have no idea what a sub is supposed to do. I have paired this sub with some Infinity Satellite Speaker Module MS-1 and the combo is perfect. Noticed that I said Satellite speakers not bookshelf or anything like that. A sub is supposed to take over the low frequency of audio. When you pair it with anything larger than sat-speakers, then you are defeating the purpose of having a sub, as the bass coming out of a larger speakers simply blends with that of the sub and they cancel each other. That is why some of you keep saying that you can not hear the sub. I did have to take some time to calibrate it and ended up setting the sound at no more than half as well as the frequency knob. To me the sub is a steal and it fills my entertaining room of 20' x 20 ' without breaking a sweat...a perfect five stars good listening to you all..........."
4,Sounds Good / Understand that this is only 100W,"The sub sounds great, but it is on the small side for a large room. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and was VERY happy with the price - this speaker was excellent value for money at $85.You do not need to have two channel input. A single subwoofer line in to either the left or right channel works fine.You do need a quality RCA signal input. As the sub is self amplified, it is sensitive to signal noise, so ensure you have a good cable from your amplifier subwoofer output to your subwoofer input."
4,Nice addition to our living room,"I purchased this sub woofer to enhance our HDTV set up in my great room. we have a samsung 55 inch that we are happy with but we wanted a better sound experience. I have up on surround sound because the speakers would keep getting disconnected by the vacuum cleaner but this was a compromise. The products works great, allows me to modify the set up easily and has a pleasing design. Overall a good buy with nice sound performance."
4,Nice suprise polk audio psw 10,"I thought it was worth the money. For your average home theater enthusiast who is looking for a sub that won't break the bank, you can't go wrong with this Polk. This sub-woofer is a great value. I bought it to replace a bose that just wasnt working. I am not an audio expert but a friend hooked it up for me, and rarely listen to music with my home theater setup. When we do have music playing on this system, it's usually during the holidays or when entertaining friends, so the music quality is not being scrutinized. For movies, this sub gives you the room shaking effects that you expect."
5,great sound for the price,compleated my sorround sound systemhas lots of boomwould recommend to family and freindsbetter than no sub at all
5,Great punch at a great price,"I was passively looking for a subwoofer and found a great deal on this unit. Only paid $80 for this. The unit arrived as expected, and literally was great bang for the buck. I have another Polk subwoofer unit (PSW111) and this unit was just as nice. Aesthetically, the box looks more ""wooden"" but I don't mind that look. It's fairly large, but packs a nice punch."
3,Not bad for the price.,"Not bad for the price. This wont vibrate your seat in a decent sized living room. However, the bass is decent enough to know you have a little power while watching movies or jamming to music. Good intro woofer"
4,Good choice for a small space (and price).,"I paired this sub with two Sony SS-B1000's to replace two ancient 12"" 3-ways that died in a move. I tried to use the RCA input first, but found that the speaker inputs worked better with my equipment. I use this system to listen to classical music mostly, and this speaker opens out the low end very nicely in the space I have."
4,As powerful as a 12 inch sub.,I got this for a friend hoping it wouldn't be as powerful as the current 12 inch Sony I have. It's every bit as powerful and bass quality is amazing
4,Great deal most bang for your buck.,I love this speaker more for the price point the bass is good after you adjust it but can get muddy if you don't have it calibrated well in your receiver. I will at some point sell this one and upgrade to the Klipsch 12 subwoofer. heard that beast in Best Buy and wow it handles bass in spades!!!
4,Great for the money,"For $79, this is a great sub. Doesnt have an LFE jack, so I had to get a splitter so it would take the LFE cable, but this product does what it says. My JBL Sub 150 was a great sub, and this is a step down for me...but acceptable. At least I wont have to straighten the pictures on the wall anymore lol.For the price, I suggest this. This was my second choice. I had ordered a larger sub from Amazon, but it was damaged and there were no more in stock. So I got this."
5,This Sub Rocks... Great Sound,"This is my first Sub on my entertainment center and I must say this speaker has amazing sound. The rumble is defined and strong at the same time. Explosions are vivid and clear. I counldn't be happier. The price of $100 was a steal compared to the local Best Buy and CompUsa. I am very satisfied with this purchase. If you are in the market for a Subwoofer that is economic and you want to add that extra punch to you movies, you can't go wrong with this Polk Audio Sub. I love the Auto ""On"" feature."
4,Subwoofer,"The perfect subwoofer for my space. Compact enough to fit the room with big sound for a great home theater experience. All at a very reasonable price. Bass output is smooth and well balanced. Setup is a snap as the output level and crossover is easily adjustable. I didn't recall reading that the PSW10 was not magnetically shielded before I bought it. Hard to imagine in this day that it was not, however, as I have an LCD TV, it was not a problem for me. Also the black cabinet finish blends well with my other speakers, equipment and cabinetry. I am very satisfied and if given a choice would buy it again."
5,Great subwoofer,"Great, tight bass. Not too boomy, but still powerful. You can't get much better for the price."
3,Pretty good while it lasted,"as many others have said this subwoofer is a tremendous bang for your buck. I bought for my entry level home theater so did not have too high of expectations but worked like a charm. Unfortunately exactly 2 months after I bought it, bass started to sound muddled and would cut in and out during movies then stopped working altogether. I contacted Polk and they troubleshot it down to the fried amplifier and offer to mail another. I'll wait to update the star rating depending on how they handle this return process."
4,Perfect for my needs,"Product works as expected. I was running with a front left, front right, and center speaker before purchasing this sub and 2 polk satellites. The subwoofer adds great depth to my entry level 5.1 setup, and as I live in a multi-unit complex I really appreciate the easy to access volume control on the back so that I can turn the base down late at night. Excellent subwoofer for the price and I would certainly recommend it for any entry level systems."
4,It's decent but a few things should be considered,"1. This sub is good for the price, but will not knock pictures off you wall.2. The sub hits lows well (Better than the sony equivalent)3. does not have an LFE port which would be helpful, but a simple y adaptor suffices.4. The sub looks slick5. Cannot turn the sub all the way up without it maxing out"
4,This is a great speaker,"The Polk PSW10 matches nicely with our RTI600's..and our polk Csi245 center speaker. I'm really happy with the sound. Honestly for 50 Watts, I wasnt expecting too much...but the bass will rattle the pictures off the walls :) You wont be dissapointed in this speaker."
5,Great Sub for the Price,"I've been looking for a new sub for awhile and couldn't believe when Amazon has it on sales at just $99, when Best Buy is still selling at $199.99. Better yet, I ordered on May 20th with free super saver shipping and yet it arrived just 2 days later, on today the 22nd.The sub is simple looking but that's a good thing, as I do not want the sub to stand out. Set up is simple and the sound is rich. For $99, you just can't get a better deal than this!!!"
5,Love it,"It has just enough low end sound, not too boomy. The best thing is it is clear, and tight with no distortion."
5,Like in the movies,"I feel like I am at the movies when I am listening to this subwoofer, as part of a 5.1 speaker system."
3,Nice appearance but weak bass,Just received this and I was initially excited. Read all the reviews and chose this over the sony 2500 model. I have this hooked up to a Vizio vsb200 sound bar using the rca cables and a y- adapter to the soundbar sub in. Perhaps I am disappointed as Im not sure how to regulate the crossover pass filter to gain an effective bass sound for all my dvd movies. Although Im not looking for a boomy bass especially for the price I paid- this sub just seems very weak- theres no punch to it so to speak. Would appreciate it if some one who has this hooked up to a vizio vsb 200 sound bar could advise me as to what they recommend the crossover to be. I would hate to return this as I dont know what other alternative id have for my budget constraints.
5,Just buy it !!,"I didn't expect to much from this sub because of the price. Man was i wrong! I only have this baby up to half its volume and I shake all the windows in my living room. Bass is deep and crisp. Music sounds awesome and movies come to life. Any type of car chase, gun firing, or explosions sound can rattle the whole house. Only con I have is my neighbor knocks on my door to turn it down!"
4,"PSW10 10"" Subwoofer",Bought this sub to use with Polk Monitor 50s and this is a good combination. Excellent sound on music and movies. The added bass is great! Large rooms might be a problem since sub can be overdriven if I crank it up. Great value especially since I paid only $67.
4,Satisfied,"You can find better but not at all at this price range. To start making a diffence you need to double the price or more.Solid, not murky, room filling bass for listening to music, Jazz, rock, classical it handles it w/o straining. My living room is 14X20 and it does the job very well. Superb value. I am satisfied and recomend the Polk PSW10 Again for its price range it is a Five Star unit."
4,"Shake, rattle and more rattle","I got this unit more for movies than for music but it has proved to be good for both. The wife doesn't so much like the boom-boom but I do, especially when watching those guy movies we love so much. I'm still moving the woofer around to find the best position. This is my first woofer and I'm really please with it as well as the service at Amazon. I originally got a woofer that popped in about 10 minutes watching the end of Matrix 3, emailed them and they shipped another one out that day - no questions! The 2nd one has been rock'in for a month now! Buy this!"
2,"Sent it back and stuck with my 8"" subwoofer!","I ordered the Polk Audio PSW10 10"" powered subwoofer with the expectations of timbre matching my Polk towers and center channel speaker while upgrading from my current 8"" powered subwoofer. It turns out that the PSW10's amplifier wasn't beefy enough to exceed or even come close to meeting the performance of my current 8"" powered subwoofer. I didn't realize that the PSW10 amplifier only averages 50 watts continuous and 100 watts dynamic power output. My 8"" powered sub outputs exactly twice that (100 watts cont/200 watts dynamic) - and the performance differences betweent the two is really noticeable. I sent the PSW10 back immediately as it did not meet my expectations."
2,Insane Port Noise! DON'T BUY!,"I bought this sub woofer because I really like sound and I wanted to get a ""good"" sub woofer for my system. When it got here I hooked it up and played it...It has some good highs but the lows suck balls...The port noise is so frickin annoying! Please do not buy this model! The port is messed up! I then spent 70 dollars more to get the PSW 110 which is the remake of it!!"
3,Not the best but does the Job,"Bought this with the Monitor 60 SII, since the speakers provide some of the lows the sub aint bad. But this sub with smaller speaker will not do good."
2,Recommended by Amazon,Amazon recommended this unit for Onkyo CS-445 CD Receiver System .....way to big!!! Had to adjust down to its lowest setting and is still to much base for the speakers that came with the Onkyo CS-445 CD Receiver System .....
1,warranty/guarantee,"if you plan of taking Polk products purchased in the US or Amazon.com outside of the US, the warranty is NO GOOD even if you take it to an authorized POLK dealer outside the US, What a bum deal,emailed POLK people, they did email me back, but keeps asking me the same questions and nothing about the subject matter of warranty outside the US, even gave them a complete info on the authorized repair facility here in the Philippines and they completely ignore me after that. NEVER WILL I BUY A POLK PRODUCT AGAIN NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY ARE."
1,No LFE Input,"The website describes the inputs for this speaker as including an LFE input, but the speaker I received does not have an LFE input. The manual I received with the speaker depicts a separate input, labeled ""LFE IN (unfiltered),"" but there is no such input on the back of the speaker.Update: When I complained about this, they sent me another one. It too does not have an LFE input, so now I have two speakers that do not live up to the description on this website. I am reluctant to complain again, because they expect me to send the first one back and these damn things are big and heavy."
3,Good for what I use it for,"This is the first sub-woofer I have had and find it ok.Thought it was going to be slightly cheaper, but hey I can't complain about the price."
2,It's Christmas time!,"So let me start by saying this is a Christmas gift so I have no idea how the speaker works yet. Shipping was very quick. However, it is CHRISTMAS TIME! We received this package today with a full photograph of the speaker on the outside of the box. My father, who the gift is for, received the package. It completely blew the surprise. Whoever ships this should really have known better. If you plan on getting this as a gift for someone be aware!"
2,I really wanted to like it...,"... given the amazing price, but it just doesn't sound very good. To my ears, it sounds flat and weak and a bit cheap (even though the construction is really solid). I'm looking to replace an 11 year old Denon DSW-37 sub with a 6.5"" woofer. The PSW10 doesn't even sound nearly as good as the DSW-37, so I'm returning the PSW10 and continuing my search. As others have said, the PSW10 is better than nothing, but probably not a great choice if you are even remotely serious about your home theater/music sound quality."
3,Dead on arrival. Bulky.,I eagerly hooked it up to my Home Theatre system but discovered it just made a buzzzzzing sound. So I called Amazon and they arranged return labels and I returned it immediately through UPS. I think I have received credit but I have not checked lately. My wife found it to be too bulky and ugly for our family room!
3,Is this the same Sub as the KLH ASW10?,"I had a KLH ASW10, The specs seem to be close, is the same SUB? The KLH had been around for a while but is no longer available, while it had some issues, this may be a decent replacement option."
5,Great subwoofer,I chose this subwoofer as BIC speakers have been great performance and great value products for as long as I can remember. I have not been disappointed so far!!!
3,"Polk Audio PSW10 ""okay for the price""","this sub woofer is not that great but for 130 bucks it will do, its only 50 watts rms so dont get confused with the 100 watts of power that's the subs peak wattage. I played Transformers and my sub couldn't keep up with my Klipsch Synergy Speakers, the sound was very distorted when LFE came into play. In addition i don't blast my receiver i keep the volume around 45 and its max is 75. Put your all into a sub so you can get want you really want out of it."
2,For entry level only!,"My purchase was to replace a Velodyne second sub in my home theater. Bad choice for this purpose. In combination with a Snell twin 15"" primary sub, all the Polk adds is a thumping sound that is not cinematic or musical in any way AND it does it from at least 150 hertz down with no real effective way to limit its output despite an alleged crossover and volume control. It's a fine sub for a small system looking to add some thud, but buyer beware if your purchase is for music other that rap or movies."
4,Decent value for the cost,"I'm partial to Polk speakers and find this sub to perform better than I expected for the price I paid ($98 on sale). While this sub doesn't perform as well as my 12 year old PSW350 (it shouldn't since it has 300 watts less power), it still sounds great. I agree with other reviews that stated that it sounds better for music than it does for home theater use... but still does a good job of filling out the sound during a move/TV show. Also, don't worry about it not having an LFE input... just max out the frequency on the back of the sub to allow your receiver to override the sub's settings and use it's own."
5,awesome for the money.,This Polk Audio subwoofer is awesome for the money.You won't find a better quality at this price you can take it for me I used to install sound systems.
4,Polk Audio 10-inch Powered Sub,"I purchased 2 of these subs for my theatre room.I'm using one with my center channel and the other on my LFE.I'm running 5 powered sub woofers in my theatre room.1 = 8"" Monoprice sub = main right channel speaker1 = 8"" Monoprice sub = main left channel speaker1 = 10"" Polk Audio sub = center channel speaker1 = 10"" Polk Audio sub = LFE1 = 12"" ENERGY sub = LFEI highly recommend running a powered sub with your center channel.....great sound!This sub is not as good as my ENERGY, but is a great subwoofer for the price.This is a great sub for the price."
4,Very good for the money,"Read all of the reviews so I was not sure about ordering it. I have never had a sub on my system and finally got around to ordering one. It adds plenty of rumble in my 13'x26' living room (hardwood floors) and my Onkyo HT-460. I have not turned the volume on the sub past 50%. It seems to fill out the lower end of normal sounds o.k., and does a better job at the rumble and punch for movie sound effects. It is OK for music with heavy bass, but not perfect. I have room for another sub and will probably upgrade for the next one. If I buy two new ones I will move this to my old surround system. Overall well worth the cost. If this is your first and you are on a budget get this one."
4,where's the sweet spot?,"As a new audiophile I bought this because the price was great. The sound is pretty loud, and I use the unfiltered LFE connection, but I think it's not crisp and I feel it could be fine tuned to handle a more dynamic range. the instructions hardly give details about the functions and settings of the phase switch (0 vs. 180) and the low pass dial (60 up to 160) other than saying to set everything ""where it sounds best."" well, no matter what setting they are at, it all sounds the same to me. Again, being a newbie, I'm not sure what to listen for.What do the settings do and are there any general rules I can follow to pick the best setting, or do I just have to live with it not knowing? It would be great to have peace of mind knowing that I am in the sweet spot. Any comments would be appreciated.For the most part, I'm happy with the PSW12 based on the following:Pros: loud, great price, auto poewer switchCons: BIG (where to put it?) and limited instructions on how to fine tune"
4,Good for the price,"This is a good subwoofer for the price. Frequency cut off, phasing, and volume controls are all on the unit. Speaker wire inputs and outputs allow daisy chaining the subwoofer and speaker together from the same amplifier speaker wire output. I have two of these and use one on each side in tandem with the left and right front speakers. The subwoofer sits underneath and the full range speaker (Polk Monitor 40) on top. With the Denon AVR988 system, DVD movies produce theater level bass that you can feel as well as hear."
5,well pleased,"I've been looking for a subwoofer for our entertainment center, and I've looked at this one quite a bit. I wasn't too sure because it only put out 50 watts RMS, but me and my wife went ahead and purchased it and boy are we well pleased. I am glad that we did because you couldn't get a better subwoofer for that price, we paid $150 at Video Only, though a month ago we could've gotten it at Circuit City for $99, but oh well. I read the review about it not working well or not that well with movies, but I cannot agree with that review, we find that it works great, me and my wife hear the lows and the highs and have not heard any muded sound. Sometimes we hear a flutter sound but to us it sounds like the air comming through the port, but that is also when we have the volume up high to high. It's definately not useless as one review says. Agian you will not be disapointed trust me. Dont let the 50 watts full you."
1,humms loudly,returned because it would choose to create humming\ interference sound that cuts on a random times - even when receiver is off. Poor quality
4,it's my second one..running dual subs.need i say more..,i think it's a great subwoofer..wish i had the money to purchase a high end sub.. but the psw sounds good. love watching blu-rays..on my plasma.sound is awesome
5,Very Pleased,"I am a novice at buying stereo equipment. I purchased this unit and was very pleased with the sound quality and appearence. There is a volume control on the back of the unit and I had to turn it all the way down to keep it from blasting me out of my living room ( I have a very small living room), but I was very happy this control was there as it made it very easy to adjust. There is a whole lot of connectors and controls on the back which made it a little more complicated to set up and the instructions are geared for more advanced users. I am very happy with the performance of this unit and it does shut it self down readily when not in use."
4,PSW10,"A nice large powered sub-woofer. This unit fit in nicely with my Onkyo 705 AV receiver. Good deep bass. You will have to buy a y connector (5.00 at Radio shack) if you're using a toslink cable, it only has the red and white connectors on the back."
3,OK,"You can not tell woofer is there most of the time. It adds a little extra bass when there is on the sound. So unless the video had heavy bass you will not know they speaker is there. The adjustments do not allow you to add more bass to the system, atleast I could not tell a difference)"
4,Perfect for our set up in the livingroom.,"Livingroom set up was a gradual process as my wife was originally against having a tv upstairs. Our main theater is in our basement set up. Using our old surround set up, previously used in the theater. Good thing is that the wife can't stand the tv speakers, so I talked her into this subwoofer and now able to add the rear surround speakers over this holiday season. Subwoofer perfect the 20' x 20' livingroom. This is my 2nd PSW10."
2,Dead on Arrival,This is a good looking unit with simple hook-up and controls. Unfortunately the one I received did not work. Zero sound from it even with a test tone from my amplifier. Had to return it.
4,PSW10 POLK POWERED SUB,"This is a bad sub for [...]bucks I have a theater in my basement and i was worried this would not be enough, but polk came through and it rocks not just the theater but the entire house."
3,Decent Subwoofer,"My subwoofer went bad and I needed to replace it. I was on a tight budget and wanted to get an immediate replacement. I was going to buy the pioneer subwoofer but it was out of stock in the stores in my area. I checked cnet and the psw10 seemed a good option for price and quality. But before getting it, I went to the Magnolia show room in Bestbuy, sure enough they did not have the psw10 in the Magnolia room, just on the floor with the rest of the cheap subs. The guy @ Magnolia demoed to me what he claimed was the best budget sub they had: the REL T5, boy it was good but for $700 it was out of my reach. He also had me hear their second best and you could hear the difference (also for $700). But because of my budget, I went with the PSW10. Now I have tested it with different scenes of different movies and I can tell it is a decent sub, but definitely this is not a sub for the big leagues. So in short if you can afford it, go with the REL and save yourself an upgrade cycle."
5,"For $100, it worth every penny","I got a 1000watt Infinity subwoofer with two 12"" radiator and one 12"" speaker in my home theater and it can be down to 18hz. It sounds very good with movie and my whole floor is shaking!! However, it is not very musical.I am building a room for my Xbox console with B&W; book shelf speakers and pioneer A/V receiver. Then I added this Polk subwoofer. It not only sounds good with Xbox and TV, it sounds very good with music too. I know it is not down to 18hz and the bass is not as solid as my infinity subwoofer. But it cost 10 times less so this is expected.I connected it with the B speaker terminal output from my A/V receiver. The sound from this Polk subwoofer is very musical. I can hear some of the music from its big speaker. It is not just boom boom boom like other cheap subwoofer.Anyway, 5 star to this Polk subwoofer for this good price and free shipping from Vann's. Cherry version looks nice. I am very happy."
4,Question not Review,This is not a review but a question about the sub-woofer and how you would connect it up into a system that does not have a receiver with a dedicated sub-woofer out.All reviews appear to discuss the sub-woofer in a system with a receiver that has a specific sub-woofer output. How do you set this sub-woofer up with a simple integrated amp / receiver that only has left and right speaker output terminals. My assumption is from the main integrated amp / receiver you go to the sub-woofer speaker input terminals with speaker wire (heavy gauge) and on the back of the sub-woofer you will find speaker output terminals that you run speaker wire from to your main front speakers. With this configuration the main integrated amp / receiver will only power your main speakers and the sub-woofer's internal amp will power itself. Is my understanding correct?
4,Solid surround sound bass,"I paired my subwoofer with the Denon 1912. When in surround sound, it gives a solid bass tone but not overdominating. In stereo, it wasn't very evident but I may have misunderstood the hookup."
4,Warning: You need to order 2 cable items to connect!,"I ordered thePolk Audio PSW10 10-Inch Monitor Series Powered Subwoofer (Single, Black)to go with myYamaha CRX-330BL Micro Component Receiver CD Player Unitand boughtBelkin PureAV AV20500-15 15-Foot Subwoofer Audio Cableto connect them. It turns out you also need aMonster ILJRY-1 F Single Female RCA to Dual Male RCA Y-Adapterto feed the signal into both channels of the subwoofer, or it doesn't work right. Once I got all the components, it's fine, but it took a week and two orders to figure it all out."
5,it so great would recommend,the item came in 4days very excited hooked it up and the bass is so loud and i even had my brother said that he will buy one because it sounds nice while watching tv listening to music and playing games on the xbox360 it really is nice
4,"Good sound, quality, clarity and bright bass","This was to replace an old sub-woofer that was part of my previous surround sound system. The Polk was easy to install in a new Yahama receiver system. The bass is more subtle, not as booming as the old one, but it's solidly there. I am pleased with it, and unless you are after a booming loud bass that overwhelms the sound, you'll like it too."
3,Sound good with most movies until it get a heavy lfe hit.,"This subwoofer sound pretty good with most movies and music. The reason I gave it a 3 star was because it produced a disturbing rattling, distorted sound on some movies that used a lot of lfe, like the hunger games bluray and even finding nemo blu ray. The ratttle was very disturbing and completely took me out of the movie experience. I'm going to try spending a little more money and getting the BIC f12. It's supposed to handle low frequencies a lot better. But it does cost twice as much. So if you're looking for clean base on intense action movies with a lot of lfe I would steer clear of this subwoofer."
5,Good value for money,For 79$ I couldn't have found any better subwoofer. Works really well and has decent build (wood). If you are looking for a reasonably priced subwoofer with good sound quality output then this is it. I bought a Pioneer 8 inch subwoofer before and paid close to 120$ and it sounded pretty terrible when compared to Polk PSW10. Has speaker input and output for old school receivers (with no pre-out's). All in all a great buy.
4,PSW10 Polk Subwoofer,"Although it is a 10"" lower powered sub, it will do the job for most basic home surround systems. With a little tuning it works better than most any subs included in those cheap home surround systems."
5,Perfect,"I needed a subwoofer to accompany my set of Infinity Entra speakers and my Denon AVR-1312. This works perfectly. The price was very reasonable. As for performance, the adjustable volume control and frequency range makes it easy to manage. I wish it had a main power switch, but like most modern day electronics, it stays in stand by unless you unplug the power cord. I only use it for music and unplug for TV and movie viewing because my Infinity Entra floor standing speakers have sufficient low end capabilities.5 stars for this Polk subwoofer. It has way more bass than I need....but may come in handy if I get annoying neighbors one day."
2,Not good for home theater,"This sub-woofer is only good for listening to music. This is not the Sub for you if your buying it to watch movies. This sub is too weak to cover all frequency for a good movie watching experience. Perfect for kids who love listening to music with bass in there bedroom, like the once your see on youtube videos."
1,Faint sound and unpleasing Amazon Customer Service,I purchased two of these subwoofers in Dec. 2012. After connecting both of the items one appears to be very faint. Hence I contacted Amazon Customer Service only to hear that I was 7 days outside of my return/exchange window. Subsequently they offered a partial refund to which all I wanted was an exchange. As a whole I can't complain about the working subwoofer however I would suggest that buyer beware of Amazon Customer Service. Check Newegg as I found a replacement slightly cheaper and I hope you receive better customer service.
3,"Decent, but dont expect much!",Worth the money but dont expect it to impress you with the sound quality. You get what you pat for.
4,Good value,For 100 dollars this subwoofer is more than enough for my bedroom.I listen to christian music all the time.
4,Awesome for the buck,"Ok, this little sub is pretty cool.I had read a few reviews that said it was little more then a ""boom"" box and that is simply not true. Now that said: This sub costs $80 with s\h its not going to sound like a $400 one.I spent about 2 hours tweaking the settings... i found listening to a band like Muse and watching a movie like StarTrek (2010) on Blueray really helped tune this thing.Everytime i turn on my system i am seriously suprised this little cheap sub puts out the sound it does, but spending the time to tweak it is very important."
5,Good Cheap Subwoofer,It sounds pretty good with my 5.1 surround sound. have it hooked up to a Denon AVR 391 in a dorm room. It's pretty loud sounds relatively clear. I'm pretty sure that the acoustics in my room are terrible which probably detract from it a little. But it shipped fast works perfectly and is not overkill for my purpose. I don't use the amp in the sub so i cant comment on how good or bad it is.
3,I own two connected to a Denon 2313CI,"Too early to rate but they are filling in where the Klipsch RF82 II's don't, sort of (not quite sure if I prefer the 82's capabilities over letting twin subs handle the lower bits yet - 70's rock and roll w/ mixed pop 40). They are spanking new so a few weeks of listening will come with an updated review.Three stars because they are literally a few hours old on my system.."
4,Good subwoofer,"Good subwoofer and a very reasonable price. When my friend heard the results after helping me hook up my sound system, he bought the same one."
3,Not impressed. It's only suitable for a small room.,"I only paid $100 for this. I figure Polk is a name brand and the reviews are all fairly good. Although it is nice looking, it does not work well in a large room (20' by 30'). It is now sitting in the small gadget room (15' by 12') and it sounds much better."
4,Polk subwoofer,"As soon as I hooked this up, sound came to life. Excellent lows and no distortion. Don't need to crank it up as the sound is loud."
5,More than happy*,"I purchased this to pair with a Vizio SB200 sound bar that I purchased for a good price. At first, I was a tiny bit disappointed. After finding a an optimal position and the optimal settings for this sub it makes watching cable tv so much more enjoyable.If you have realistic expectations for this sub, you will be happy. You are not going to get the lows that a $200+ sub will provide.For the record, I am currently using a single subwoofer rca cable plugged into the L input / freq turned all the way clockwise / and sub level at about 50%."
5,Great bass!,Very impressed with the speakers. I have grown to love Polk speakers for sound and value. GO for it you will not regret.
4,Fantastic for the $$$!!!,"I bought the PSW10 on Amazon for about $100, and I am blown away by the value. I worked as a profesional home theater installer for about 5 years and sold many $400 subs that were no better than this. The 50 watt power rating is very conservative. Truth is, it's just an honest rating on a quality amp. I paired it with a run-of-the-mill Pioneer receiver and the Klipsch Quintet II speaker system. (also from Amazon $300)The end result for a $400 speaker system is amazing. For music and movies at low to moderately high volume, you could spend $2000 on a Bose system and not have sound this accurate and dynamic. (My mother in law just did)."
2,"Sounds good, doesn't always power on","When I first got the speaker, wired it up and started using it every thing was good. A few days later I noticed the auto-on feature wasn't working. I would turn the receiver on but the sub would not turn on even though the green light was on. I would have to either unplug the RCA cable(s) or even unplug the power cord and plug it back in to get it to start working.This continued to happen every few days so I would need to unplug cables to get it to work. I tried different RCA cables but the same problem happened. Then last night when I turned the receiver on the speaker worked for about 2 seconds and then just turned off and I had to unplug the power cable to reset it. This is getting annoying so I did a replacement and hope a new one works."
5,Great Deal Great Product,"I bought this sub to go in my dorm room up at App State. It was worth every penny. Let's just say after I got this thing, everyone knew who had the best audio system on our floor xD"
2,Big Sub with Muddy Sound,"I guess mine is a lemon and will have to return it.I've been looking for a nice sub to pair with my Energy Take Classic 5. After some research, I picked the PSW10. It is very nice that when New.egg sale it for 79.99, Amazon immediately adjusted its price too. I have to say that I'm a big fan of amazon.Back to the sub. After receiving it, I set it up with my Onkyo receiver. The bass sound is awful. When volume is low, the sound is not quite persistent. When volume is adjusted to produce persistent low frequency sound, it sounds muddy and not deep at all. Even the subwoofer came with the HTiB system sounds million times better than this one. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the price and the look of the product."
4,"good sub, for the price","This was part of my home stereo upgrade. If you compare it to the Energy 5.1, (http://www.amazon.com/Energy-RC-Micro-Surround-Speaker-System/dp/B001RQ2CXO/ref=sr_1_2?s=aht&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1359430788&sr;=1-2&keywords;=home+speakers) and you price out the polk system (4 owm3 and psw10) , you can see you get much better value for your money.while this is a decent sub (especially when you consider price) dont expect a ton of thump. Its enough to better a stereo without a sub, but if you want to really feel the bass, youre going to have to spend a LOT more."
4,great home subwoofer.,So I've got great mid range but no bass. Bought this hoping to find something affordable yet durable. This sub is perfect for any setup and has the best sound for the price. Totally recommended.
5,Nice sound!!,"Pretty good range and sound for a 10"" and the price. The sound is crisp and clear, low enough for beginners. The sound at lower frequencies gets lose a little bit. but overall is a perfect product for beginners!!"
3,Good but not great...,"Ok. First of all I have to let you know that I purchased 2 of these for my Man-Cave. Together they sound really good. Alone, I don't think it would be strong enough for my taste.Pro's: Built solid. Looks good. Sounds good for less than $100.Con's: Can only have the ""gain"" up to 50%, any higher and it sounds distorted. The grill on one of my subs rattles when the base hits real hard... but the other sounds fine. If you take off the grill it goes away. But the biggest thing is that you can't turn the ""gain"" up past 50% or so because you will hear a lot of distortion.Watched Terminator Salvation last night. Sounded really good, nice bass... but I also have 2 of these.Would have gone with a Polk 12"" like the 505... i think that's what my brother has. Thats hits real good and sounds real nice.All in all.... I am happy with them, but I wish they were able to do what is expected of them."
5,Polk review,"It works great! Hooked up easily and seems to do the trick. I really don't know much about sub-woofers, but when we turn it up, you can sure hear and feel the base."
5,Great Low Priced Sub,"Bought this sub woofer a week ago from RC Willey, and paired it with my denon receiver. I couldn't be happier with the performance. With music the sub pounds out the low bass notes beautifully while not overwhelming the other speakers. During movies it grounds out the bass at low enough frequencies to rattle the pictures hanging on our walls. I have no reservations what so ever about the performance of this sub. We have a fairly large living space (18x25)ish and it fills the space fine. Our seats however are relatively close to the sub, with the furthest ones being about 17 ft out. In any case it sounds great, and I'm very impressed for such an affordable unit. A huge improvement from our panasonic home theater system."
4,big woof small price,This little baby is amazing for the money. It works great for music. Just a little goes along way to open up your speakers by relieving them from the low end task. I have tried it with a variety of listening tests. It has earned its place in my music environment.
4,Better than expected,"I wasnt sure what to expect when buying an 89 dollar subwoofer but for my small living room, it sounds great."
4,Polk Audio very nice,good price and seems to be holding up well. I would buy again for the sale price for under 100
4,Great value,"I would consider myself a speaker nut and when I found myself needing a sub on a budget this came up. My expectations were not very high and once I got it set up it has been impressive. The bass is solid and responsive, cabinet design is minimal and efficient, hook ups are adequate. One drawback is that it lacks a LFE connection. I'm definitely thinking about getting a second one to complete the 7.2 setup."
4,"Great price, good product, some ambient noise","I would give this 5 full stars except for one item with some reverb when it is powered on. This is resolved when actively being used, and the auto on/off resolves this most of the time except for when I first turn it on.The mulitple hook up options are very versitle and will connect to just about any stereo given the options. The manual volume make it function good to your taste. My largest issue is how the hooks ups are on the back and the speaker/port on the front. It makes it difficult to face the sub into the corner for better base and hide your wiring. I end up having to either face it the wrong way or look at the wires. Just being able to move the grill cloth on the back would solve this problem."
5,AMAZING sub!,"Hands down, this is the sub for the money. It packs a punch for being only ten inches. The first day I got it, I ""somewhat"" annoyed my neighbors as this is just a beast! Just make sure you get the crossover set right on your receiver and set the low pass all the way up on the sub... will sound great!"
1,Still Weak And Lame,"Two Dollar Guitar's indie/country mix pretty well all sounds the same, it's all bad, all the time. The idea of Lo Fi sounds good on paper, but in practice, there is a reason bands go into the studio. This album should be burned and buried."
3,Mom's review,"This dress was purchased for my 5 year old for her birthday present. I really thought she would love it because she loves music and loves to dance. I miscalculated her liking the song. She doesn't know the music and she is not into ballet so she played with it some, but was not as enthusiastic as I expected. She loves dress up and still plays with the dress some, but it would have made a much greater hit if it played a more recognizable song for her age, like something Disney or a cartoon song. I feel like it was more my fault because I misjudged her preferences more so than the dress being the problem. Any little budding ballerina will probably absolutely love this item."
2,Color shown is not the exact color,"If you have ordered this watch impressed by the pleasant pink color, you will be disappointed like I am on receiving a peach colored watch and not the one in the image"
3,PINK WATCH COMMENT,"I found the face of the watch smaller than I expected. The watch band was slightly big since I have a very small wrist. Also, the watch band was more of a shrimp color pink (not a bright pink, more subdued). Overall I would say this watch is just average!! I did like the pink background on the face of this watch though."
5,"Very important book for our times, whether Jewish or not.","This book is a must read for anyone concerned about the state of the world. Responsibility is anathema to most people these days. Everyone seems to be about instant gratification through stuff, or ""feeling good"", but without the important factor of DOING.I strongly recommend this book for everyone in our Fractured World."
5,"Factory Reconditioned KitchenAid RRK5AWW 325-Watt, 5-Quart S","Wonderful! We saw this reconditioned mixer for [$$$] what a deal! Although it is reconditioned it arrived looking like it was brand new, and it works like a charm. You can't beat it for the price! I wonder know how I got along without it all these years. If you ever see another one at this price jump on it...you'll never regret it!!"
2,Great while it lasted.,I loved this while it worked. This worked great for the first 2 times we used it. After that it wouldn't work. It has a 6 month warranty so I am in the process of getting if fixed.
5,"Great price, great product","I've wanted a KitchenAid mixer for years, and was thrilled to find this mixer for $104 and free shipping! I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who can find such a great promo!"
2,Refurbished Kitchen Aid stand mixer,"Recently used mixer to make dough, but the engine got hot pretty rapidly. So, we need to limit the use of the mixer for this purpose."
4,Reconditioned KitchenAid Mixer,"This is my dream mixer!! I've been looking for a KitchenAid ever since I made my daughter's 9 layer wedding cake with my old Oster Kitchen Center. So, I was elated when I found this for a great price. From the height of excitement to the depths of despair. I didn't even think to check if it would fit on my counter under my cabinets. It doesn't!!! So, I'm packing it up to return it in exchange for a shorter version with a tilt-up head. I'm still excited about getting it. Already planning to bake for friends and strangers."
4,Soft Nylon Gears!,"I have this refurbished model in the Imperial Gray. It is a nice-looking addition to my countertop. For most projects, it does an excellent job! HOWEVER, the manual was excessively optimistic in its claims that this mixer can knead two loaves of wheat bread dough! Be aware that the gears are all NYLON, and the motor is plenty strong enough to strip the gears when it lugs down on stiff wheat dough. I have done so THREE TIMES now. Kitchenaid is now marketing a 6-quart ""professional"" model with all steel gears and a circuit breaker ... If you are going to buy a Kitchenaid mixer for real bread, go the extra mile for the tougher model. ..."
3,Sheep in Wolf's Clothing!,"I owned the 5-quart K'Aid for roughly three years. Like manyAmericans, I'd grown up thinking these were the best mixers available.So, when the time came to move up from my little Sunbeam I went forthe 5-quart.I grind my own grain and quickly discovered thismachine is weak in the knees when it comes to bread dough. Not onlyis it limited in the amount it can do, but it also got so hot kneadingthat the head would get truly hot to the touch. I contacted K'aid atthe time and they told me that was normal, just to be sure and let themixer cool between batches. While I wanted to make more loaves, itwas a strain on the machine to get through two loaves at a time. Itdid, however, make beautifully smooth mixes and batters. I resolvedto replace it when I could affort it. (...)Look around before rushing out and buying KitchenAid--there are otherchoices!"
5,A Dream machine!!,"After burning up a mixer that was rated for bread dough I decided I really needed a heavy duty machine and I got it!!! As a gift from my husband for our 33rd anniversary/Mothers Day. I make our bread and need a machine that can handle the dough.I also make cheese cakes and the Kitchen Aid mixer was absolutely wonderful. I was afraid that the ingriedients would not get mixed well without scraping the bowl sides , not so. It not only mixed everything throughly it did it quickly. This refurbished mixer arrived in excellent condition, one could not tell it is refurbished. I really feel I got an excellent deal, a super mixer at a super price. My husband was really pleased too when I phoned him at work to tell him how much I loved the Kitchen Aid Mixer"
4,KitchenAid RRK5AWH 325 Watt 5-Quart Stand Mixer,I think it is a great mixer. It is a little tought to lock the bowl in though and I wish it would have come with the plastic cover/pourer.
2,No tilt-up head,I find the mixer cumbersome to operate in not being able to tilt the head and the bowl being so deep. It is difficult to scrape the bowl and add ingredients as it is mixing. I would never have bought this mixer if I had realized the head does not tilt. I did not research thoroughly enough. It never occurred to me such drastic changes could/would be made to a mixer. I also notice the technical data mentions it includes a pouring shield. This was not included nor did I think it would be when I made the purchase as it was not pictured. I am selling it.
1,Total Bait and Switch!,"Advertised as one day only sale, but when I tried to purchase it I was notified that the item was not available. Offered similar products for more money"
5,Best Kitchen Investment,"This is the best kitchen investment I ever made. I did lots of research on this product before purchasing. I wanted a heavy-duty mixer that had lots of flexible options for attachments. The only holdback was the price. I was waffling between a similar style carried by Kenmore when I ran across this reconditioned option. I was a little scared about ordering something not ""brand new"". But it arrived all professionally packaged with a 6-month warranty and in immaculate condition. I use this for EVERYTHING."
5,great value,"Received my mixer SO quickly I was amazed, and elated at the condition of it. It (not only)looks brand new, but runs like a top!....excellent value AND service....LOVE LOVE LOVE my kitchen-aid."
4,Reconditioned Kitchen 5-Quart mixer,I am very pleased with this mixer. It is just as I requested. Received in excellent condition. The performance reaches all of my expectations in a KitchenAid appliance.
5,Bread kneading,"You guys do know that you shouldnt fully knead the bread dough in the mixer. You start it partially and knead the rest by hand so you dont over work the dough. then you let it rise, then punch it down and then form it into the shape you need then bake away. Kneading the whole process in a mixer is a lazy mans way of making bread. we used this same mixer through my Le cordon bleu culinary program and it worked fine."
4,Good for most needs,"I owned this mixer for several years, and in size and power it is suitable for most baking needs. Once I became interested in bread making, though, this mixer revealed its limitations. As other reviewers have pointed out, when kneading a tough dough for several minutes, the motor gets very hot. I finally burned it out (despite careful watching) on a brioche dough, which requires 15 minutes of kneading. If you are into bread making, or if you are cooking for a large family and make double batches, the Professional series is a better bet."
5,Great!,I loved the price and knowing that something that could have been trash was now going to be used! Works and looks like new.
5,"Beautiful, quiet and powerful",Gave this to my wife as a gift. She loves it.Pro's: Powerful. Really powerful. Love the bowl lift feature. Great expandability. Makes my childhood Sunbeam stand mixer look like a joke.Con's: None.Just use it. Can't get much better than this unless it could reach into the cabinets and cook for you.
2,Dark and Dank Palmer.,"Palmer ought to really try another art form as a profession--perhaps cartoons for a start.I have never seen anything this man has done regarding classical bio that is sustained good story telling or bio. He likes explicit physical suffering in the darkest of environments.Never the joy of Shostakovich--in bright light and benevolent clarity-- holding hands with ormandy and Rostropovich in Philadelphia--smiling, happy, joyful. I would play the third movement of the tenth and do a Beethoven like ode to joy ( and liberation from Stalin) at the end of the film by playing the later part of the last movement of the Tenth--- that expresses joy, happiness, supreme confidence and excitation. That would be in good taste and leave us uplifted. Palmer likes pus and the dark prison of the suprressed mind. Don't like his stuff."
3,Solid CD That's Exactly What CD Title Says,"A solid roundup of Psychedelic Jazz & Funky Grooves from the late 1960's and early 1970's. No real hidden gems and ultimately uninspiring since it would seem there are hundreds/thousands of more interesting and obscure titles they could have chosen from but instead, CD selection seemingly randomly selected by a computer based on how many tracks would fit on a CD with a sprinkling of ""names"" to help sell the CD - no real flow or greater sense of the choices here. All fine but could've been much better."
3,worthwhile,"Lots of music on here; some good, some great, and some so-so. All in all, this is a good but uneven collection (stylistically, it covers a wide gamut) that can open your eyes --- and ears --- to some interesting songs or artists that you missed way back in the day. Always nice to discover some worthwhile musical nuggets ... and there are definitely a few of those in this collection."
2,Kindle version lacks indices,"BEWARE! The Kindle version of this wonderful book does NOT have the indices. I was disappointed, decided to stick with the hard-cover, and returned the e-book."
1,Doesn't work,"I tried every which way to get this thing to work. It didn't so it's going back. The only instructions are on the box and say to connect one end of the cable to the tv and the other to the antenna base. That's it. It also has an ac adapter but doesn't really say to even use this. Anyway, I tried all combinations of plugging this thing in, dialing the gain control. The reception was worse than what I started with. Plus I couldn't get UHF stations at all. So, my advice is to forget it and buy something else."
2,"a good antena, but shipping slow","Including shipping, it cost me 27 dollars, but I found an other antena almost same quality, only 20 dollars in target. Also I waited more than 1 week for the deliver."
1,waste of moola,"Bought this at a local store for $29 (Aafes rips you off, i was just trying it out). Here on Ft Bragg atleast, I got no better reception with this than my regular bunny ears. The only channel I could receive with the plain ol' bunny ears is NBC. and with this with the dB gain all the way up the picture is just about the same, if not worse. and without the amplifier I got zip. Now, I will say this, I am on a regular TV that does not support ATSC signals (hdtv). Maybe with an appropriate hardware it may work better since a lot of stations have to broadcast in ATSC. but until then, gonna return this bad boy and stick with the good ol' bunny ears."
1,Bad antenna,"Live in a apt. in NYC, can see Manhattan. Save your money, get a Terk antenna. The RCA was worst than my rabbit ears, even with amplification.What amplification? Didn't see a difference, even with regular channels. Got it for my HDTV, what a waste. Wish I listened to the reviews."
1,Save your money,"I purchased two of these units and was excited to save money on my cable bill. When I hooked the antenna to all my TV sets, I picked up ""no channels"". I picked up fuzz on several channels, and found I picked more channels on my TVs when I disconnected it...go figure"
4,Cheap and functional,"Not a bad antenna for $15. I have a USB HD Tuner and it work perfect. Picks up most stations in HD. However, it is not well suited for non digital stations (analog stations). You should probably go with an amplified outdoor antenna if you want to pick those up clearly."
1,Did not work for me at all,"I had a five dollar set of bunny ears attached to my HDTV here in Chicago. Reception was great for all Chicago HD channels except for Fox in HD. I saw this antenna at Best Buy and it said on the box that it was optimized for HD reception. I thought the Fox HD reception would improve when I replaced my cheapo bunny ears with this RCA ANT401. Unfortunately, I could not get clear reception from any HD channels after installing it."
3,It's a good introduction.,"Kay Arthur's books all lead to helping one discover the Bible through observation, interpretation, and application. But having read her book ""How to Study Your Bible Precept Upon Precept,"" I guess I found this with not much else to add. So it was okay, but not something that was necessary for me, but I'm sure it would be of some benefit to one not familiar with her program."
5,Wow! Much better than I thought they'd be.,"These shoes are not only comfortable, but flashy and adorable. I get compliments whenever I wear them. They are much more rich in color than they appear in the photo. A great add to my wardrobe."
5,Who is this Guy?,"I am not sure how I found this book, but I am glad I did. I am probably going to have to read it a couple of times. There is no way I can really comprehend fully alot of the ideas in this book. I also see now I need to purchase a dictionary. I will defenitley purchase book for gifts-"
3,would work if the base could be firmly attached,"My cats do play it, however, they often knock it right over or just pull the entire stick out as well. It should design to be firmly attachable to the floor."
2,Not sturdy,Not great quality - within a few minutes my cats had ripped the toy completely off & I had to superglue it back on. Which meant that replacing the toy would not be an option. Also it's so light weight that the lightest smack knocks it over. Such a great concept & they really wanted to play with it but just not worth the money with the design the way it is.It may work great for small kittens but do not recommend for adults.
1,Cat not interested at all.,"Within 3 Minutes my cat disconnected the entire wand from the mechanism. She was not interested in chasing the feather at all.She loves Cat Dancer, Laser toys and Fling-Ama-String."
4,Kitty Waits for it to be turned on,My cat loves this toy. Ella will sit by the toy and wait for me to turn it on for her. I gave this a 4 star only because I had to tape (electrical) the little toy end to the plastic arm. Every time Ella would catch the the moving toy it would fall off. Also sometimes Ella gets very excited in trying to catch the moving toy she will knock it over. But I like that it has two settings. One is a 15 minute timer and the other is the on timer. We have had it for several weeks and Ella still wants to play with it.
4,great toy! needs better motor,"I have purchased two Panic Mouse toys. My cats love it. I have one cat who will play with it until she wears herself out. The random movement and speed adjustment make it a great toy they don't get tired of. However...... The first one I bought stopped working after about a month. I sent it back to the company and they sent me a new one. This one lasted about 6-8 months before it too stopped working. The motor doesn't seem to be strong enough to take the constant tugging on the toy. If they could improve the motor to keep it working, it would be the best cat toy ever!"
1,terrible,"Do not waste your money on this cheap toy. It looks fun, but it's noisy and not durable. Mine had a horrible *organic* smell when I got it, and it was absolutely filthy. So was the bubble wrap around it! And the on/off button did not work: it would turn on, but not off.That aside, the wands easily pull right off. They don't actually attach, they just hold on with friction, which doesn't stand a chance against a determined feline!Needeless to say, I'm sending it back."
3,"She loves it, but...","Again a product the cat really enjoys. I found that it works best without the motor, letting her play with the wand itself. I wish I could give this more stars, but the wand falls off after 5-10 minute play. I have since taped it to the base with electric tape, and that seems to work. However, my cat keeps pulling it over, so again, I will have to find a way to extend the base to prevent this."
4,My male cat likes this product,"It will keep your cat amused for at least 10 minutes at a time. The product seems well made and have had no problems with it. I DID have to use a little electrical tape to keep the arm attached, but works fine now."
4,Awesome cat toy,"My 14 year old cat loves this toy. I bought the feather attachment because my cat tends to like feathers better than the fuzzy ball that comes with it. I put it on some packing paper to make it run across a noisy surface and make the feathers hide. The only downside is that the on/off timer on it turns the toy off too soon, and if you don't use it, the toy will keep going until the batteries are dead."
3,A good toy for small kittens,"Like other reviewers, I found this to be a toy for SMALL kittens and ah, perhaps.. large elderly cats? :)but, no match for my 4 month old male. He did have some fun with it for a couple hours, but then found he could easily pull the yellow wand off - if not drag the whole toy around the room. ah well."
3,Good amusement,Product was not brand new and missing the pink nose. Also had worn marks on the face. My cat was amused for about the first half hour and easily tips the base over.
2,"It's a good idea, but...","This thing gives my 7 month old kitten a lot of fun for 5 seconds. After five seconds, he's caught it in his mouth, bent the rod, and halted the motor. After 10 seconds, he's removed the mouse/feathers and rod from the base and I'm chasing him down to retrieve it before he tears it up. It might work for my kitten with the following improvements: the rod is made of titanium, a 5 HP geared motor, the feathers or mouse is made of Teflon, and it should be beta-tested by cheetahs in the Serengeti. Perhaps for an older less excitable cat it would be o.k.? I give it 2 stars because it's a great idea and makes the cat very excited."
1,Revere ware not worth the cost,I bought this pot for cooking gumbo thinking that a heavy pot would prevent sticking but this pot cooks no better than a much cheaper pot from the discount store. I wish I had never purchased it.
2,Misleading Title,"The title is very misleading in that the book's main focus is not on Database Modeling but the use of Visio and reverse engineering. There are very generic references to ORM and UML.The more appropriate title should have been ""Microsoft Visio for Database Modeling"".It's a great user's manual for Microsoft Visio for Enterprise Architects.This book in combination with Information Modeling and Relational Databases: From Conceptual Analysis to Logical Design is a great combo."
2,Lacks Depth,"I am a huge fan of Terry Halpin, and have tried to use ORM on every one of my projects since I read one his previous books. But I have to say I was disappointed in this book.This book provides an overview of what ORM is, and how to use Microsoft's database modeling tool to design ORM models.. But it lacks depth. I learned a few small tidbits, which I could have probably gleaned from the newsgroups had I bothered.This book will probably make it into my box of tax donations pretty quickly."
5,No more feet,"I got this as odor control for my sons room, and I couldn't be happier. Its a rental house and the odor was here when we moved in and nothing we tried worked. I've tried air filters, ionizers, baking soda, you name it. Nothing seemed to work. I set this up and in about 15 min. it was gone. Clean the unit once a month and now I move it around to wherever I need it. I don't recommend putting it into a small room without some sort of airflow."
5,Awesome Tent,"My husband and I love this tent. We recently used the tent on a trip to Acadia National Park. The tent was easy to set up. It took my husband 10 minutes to set it up. It is very roomy as well. We had a queen sized air mattress, a pack and play for my 14 month old daughter and 3 duffle bags and still had quite a bit of room to spare. To call it spacious would be an understatement. We had a slight rain storm one of the nights in Acadia and we stayed perfectly dry. No leaks at all. At the end of the trip my husband was quite surprised when he packed up the tent and it fit perfectly in the bag it came in. Bottom line this is a quality tent and worth the money we spent on it."
4,Great Tent,"We have used this tent on two trips so far. So far I am very pleased with this tent.We purchased it for just the two of us so that we would have a ""bedroom"" area and a ""living room"" area. The size of the tent definitely fit this need. It accommodated our queen size mattress with plenty of room for chairs and a small table in case there was rain during the vacation. The vents on the top kept the humidity down along with the three windows & door. We did get rain on both trips and there was a small amount of leakage...approx a quarter cup of water total... so very minimal. The water is coming in between the tarp material that makes up the bottom of the tent & the regular tent material that makes up the sides of the tent on the door side. We'll get some spray sealant and be all set for next time. The water issue was the only reason it didn't get five stars. Other than that, we're very happy with this purchase."
2,1 season tent at best,"First & only trip: Canyonlands, UTFirst night: wind ripped 2 of the rain fly's cords, rain fly's pole disengaged, one zipper broke, wind flattens tent requiring us to change the orientation of our heads, so our feet were in direct contact w/ the tent wall instead of our facesSecond night (abandoned the fly): wind flattens tent worse than on the prior night despite having 3 walls protected (by rock & foliage), second broken zipper (on bag, thankfully)The wind we experienced on this trip was far from overwhelming. 6 other tents were on the trip with us, none of which had any of these problems.Finally, the storage bag is woefully inadequate to repack this tent.Bottom line - I will use this with my children in the backyard ONLY if the weather is going to be perfect - which begs the question - why not just sleep under the stars?"
4,Colemann Montana Big Sky Seven Person Dome Tent,"It's big! The tent set up, for the most part, easily. Definately takes 2 poeple, but otherwise worked well."
5,Great Family Tent,"We've had this tent for about 3 years and it's holding up well. It's pretty easy for two people to set up. When I first bought the tent, I broke one of the poles trying to set it up by myself (not possible!) and I called Coleman and they immediately sent me a new pole at no charge. The tent holds two queen size air mattresses with some space in between them. We just got back from a trip where we had torrential rains and gale-force winds and the tent kept us dry. But if you're expecting a lot of wind, you might want to invest in some better tent stakes than the ones that come with the tent. They bend pretty easily. In summary, though, a great tent for the money, and really good for car camping with the family."
2,defective product,"What's going on with Coleman lately? This is the second Coleman product I purchased this year (the other was a new stove) and both have had serious defects. Yes, they are willing to refund it but I'm really frustrated. We have relied on Coleman for high quality, reasonably priced outdoor items but those days seem to be over."
4,Tent survived wind storm,"My kids and I went to the plains in Wyoming to camp along the Oregon Trail like our pioneer ancestors. That night there were gusts of wind 65 MPH. It took several people to put up the tent as the wind would lift it like a parachute. I could not sleep because I thought the tent would come down. The tent made it. It leaned a bit, but it made it. We stayed completly dry inside even though it had rained. Some other campers we were with were not lucky. Coleman has some better, thicker tent stakes that we bought, and I am glad we did. I don't thing we would have been as lucky with the cheap tent stakes that came with the tent. It is very roomy inside though I can't see 6 or 7 people sleeping in it. It fit four very comfortably with extra space for all our gear including a large cooler."
2,"Big tent, easy set up, but it leaks","My wife and I bought this tent to fit our new son, his pack and play and all our stuff. I read the reviews and bought the water sealer. I followed the directions to seal the seams, but the first night it rained after applying, water leaked in.The rain fly is poorly designed. It must be staked out to work at all, and even when done so properly, it ends about an inch above the bottom of the windows, meaning the water pours down right onto that seam. Not very smart.It's very big and pretty easy to set up, but just have to hope the weather stays kind."
2,Made in China...,"Very nice size and easy to set up.We bought this tent and she was broken and a lot of water enter inside. The seller exchange the tent for the same model... the second was broken at one place and took water everywhere.Very cheap model made in China. We disappointed by Coleman...---------------Spacieuse et facile a monter ! Nous avons ete enchantes lorsque nous l'avons montee.Par contre, c'est un modele de tres mauvaise qualite. Nous avons achete la tente et plusieurs coutures etaient decousues. De plus, l'eau s'infiltrait a plusieurs endroits. Nous l'avons retournee au vendeur et il nous a donne une autre tente du meme modele. Sur la seconde, il y a une couture decousue et de l'eau qui s'infiltre aussi a plusieurs endroits.Modele de tres mauvaise qualite ""fabrique en Chine"". Nous sommes tres decus par Coleman... nous pensions que c'etait une entreprise fabriquant des produits de qualite."
1,This is NOT your mother's RevereWare!,I was greatly disappointed with this product. It did not have the traditional heavy copper and stainless bottom and sides that I expect from Revere. It has just a thin coating of copper on the bottom which would not do an adequate job of distributing the heat which would translates to hot spots. Tapping the bottom sounded like a cheap tin drum. I returned the product for a full refund. I will buy my Reverware from eBay from now on.
1,Not for flat surface stoves,Nothing in the review said this would not work on a flat stovetop surface. I just tried to boil water and it was bouncing all over and the water was splashing out. I guess it would have been better on any other surface but I didn't find out before I bought it.
5,Great pot.,"I love all my revere cookware. I have had other brands and they just don't hold up.Not a fan of nonstick. I hate it when it starts coming off, so I always prefer stainless steel. My favorite revere pots have the aluminum disc bottom. They are the best for candy making as you need that heavy thick plate to cook the candy without burning."
2,Too thin of a coat...good for soup cooking in large quantity,My wife did not like this too much. Her main complaint is that it is too thin and is NOT 'nonstick' making her life miserable cleaning it.
3,decent,I like Moon Pix and Dear Sir better. This one has a couple of really good songs but as a whole the others are more satisfying.
2,"Boring, amateurish, apparent diamond in the rough","1 1/2Dreadfully, derivatively dull, guitar-based simpleton ramblings sounds like the depressed goth chic strumming in her garage band on weekends from junior year. Ms. Marshall's sophomore release might have fooled many with delusions of raw emotion, when in actuality the only the that rings noticeable throughout these sludgy sessions is her occasional vocal intuition."
4,"Myra Lee, Primal Power!","Found this early, primal, Cat Power a gateway into understanding--and fully enjoying--the Cat Power I discovered late, with ""Jukebox."" Entirely different style and delivery from her later works (i.e., post ""You Are Free""), very skeletal song structures on the original tracks, but wow such feeling and depth of delivery! Love ""Rockets"" (same track as on her other first album, ""Dear Sir""), ""Ice Water,"" ""Enough,"" and ""Not What You Want."" Then, out of the blue, this trio (Chan, Steve Shelly, Tim Foljahn), lapses into familiar, melodic chords sidling into an iconic cover of Hank Williams' ""Still In Love""--what diversity. Buy this album, listen to it repeatedly and then view some 1995 Cat Power videos on YouTube!"
5,GTG,"its a solid little socket, don't be afraid to get this one it has worked out great. Got it to remove my motorcycles front tire axle bolt and it seems like a quality product so far."
3,Bringing Sexyback,"I like the beat, the words are stupid. Funny when did it become cool to like Justin. When he was in nsync everyone talked about how his high pitched voice was so horrible. He hooks up with some black guys and all of a sudden he's cool. Well the fans of nsync always knew he had a good voice so ha!"
1,real wack,"Sexyback is superwack to me. this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day. makes me think of Trent Rezinor's ""closer"" Meets Laidback's ""White horse"". Timberlake is trying to channel so much,but ends up forgetting the most important person in the song&that is himself. a really flat track."
4,Sexy mixes,"You really get your money's worth on this one. ""Sexyback"", the original edit, is terrific electronica. On this one you receive the original version (Explicit) plus the following excellent mixes: Linus Loves Remix, Poker Face Remix, Tom Novy Ibiza Dub and the Director's Cut of the superb video. Highly recommended as this one breaks new ground for Justin. Sexy!"
3,O.K.,"I do not usually review a book unless I absolutely love it and can give it five stars, but ""Outlaw"" by Elizabeth Lowell is the second installment in the ""MacKenzie/Blackthorn"" series and it would be a good idea to read it for continuity. The first story in the series ""Fire and Rain"" and the third story ""Granite Man"" were awesome."
5,Perfect,"Elizabeth Lowell has mastered the creation of the perfect hero. The handsome, strong, rugged hero who commands the respect of the men with whom he works, produces fear in the hearts of those who dare to cross his path and still manages to host a sensitive heart. He overcomes the fear of a brilliant, dedicated, man-shy, archaeologist who is stronger than she thinks and becoming stronger by the minute. In their own ways and with help from each other, they overcome their individual obstacles to love, to find in each other's arms a passion and love to last. And while that might sound corny, the truth is that none of the events in the novel come across as contrived for effect. And while it is a modern fairy tale, it is totally believable. It flows naturally and allows you to experience nature - the loveliness and wildness, as it draws you into the personas of Ten and Diana. Love it."
2,The heroine irks me.,"I've never been sexually assaulted so maybe I just can't relate to the kind of pain and anger the heroine feels. But she's just so darned touchy! She condemns all men as sex-starved savages. Then when the hero starts to treat her with the kind of indifference she claims she wants, she gets annoyed because he doesn't notice her as a woman. I mean sheez! Make up your mind, willya? She's constantly fighting this battle between her unwilling attraction to the hero and her old fears of all men. I can't identify with that kind of immature, irrational, erratic temperament. Get OVER it already!If you're a hardcore EL fan, pick this one up at the local library. It ain't worth the money."
5,Outlaw by Elizabeth Lowell,Second in Colorado series. Continues the family theme. Love being able to listen and work at the same time. Makes dull chores go faster. I am a happier person.
2,Important info -- but short on story.,"I would recommend reading this book, if only to stay informed on the details of the characters. This story didn't really unfold anything interesting about Tennessee's history. A really great guy, all in all, but we don't know why. As for Diana, I just don't get her. Okay, her dad was a grump and her ex forced himself on her; for this, she hates and fears all men?Once she finally comes to her senses and realizes she wants to enjoy herself with Ten, then the story heats up. But the heat is practically at the end of the book!I love the way the author consistently puts so much detail about her settings into all of her stories -- the setting becomes a character. I feel like I'm actually learning something. But, in this case, the main character was the mystery of the Anasazi people and the minor story was the relationship of Diana and Ten."
1,excellent account of Anasazi history I have ever read,Unfortunately I thought I was buying a romance novel. I admit Elizabeth Lowell out did herself in her research. I am only in Chapter 8 I know nothing of the hero and heroine but I know everything about archeology that I do not care to know. I will finish this book because I paid for it but I will have to reconsider the Mira book line in the future. I hate when a novelist gets so caught up in her research they forget the reader doesn't care. If I wanted a history lesson I would have purchased a history book. Boring and at chapter 8 I don't care one artifact about the hero or heroine.
5,Great item,This is a great item for people with low vision. It is easy to use and easy to understand. It was purchased for my Mother and she loves it. Great product!
1,Reizen Talking Clock and LED Flashlight,Using this clock and trying to set it up to work properly is very difficult. Instructions are not easy to use and it does not perform the function needed without a lot of trial and error. I would never recommend this product to anyone.
4,Moving Short Stories for Everyone,An outstanding and moving group of short stories that offers a wondeful view of growing up in the Midwest. The reader will find parallels to his/her own memories in this well written and descriptive book. Ms. Moranville has done a great job of reminding a genration of how we grew up.
1,Move On: More Harmful Than Helpful,"This text was such a waste of money. The editor's of these tests did absolutely nothing, as far as I'm concerned. An example, there was a independent question in the physical sciences that had no correct answer. Do you know how frustrating that is after taking a day long test? That's not it. The exam was littered with errors and even more incorrect answers."
3,Whirlwind Tours,The book provides tours that cover a lot of ground in a very limited fashion. Neighborhoods rich in history are given perfunctory treatment being covered in generally three pages or less. I wish the author provided fewer tours but gave them the depth they deserve.
5,If you like the website...,"As a long time fan of the website, I was really excited to see that Mr. Walsh was afforded the opportunity to expand upon a great and unique idea of his. Bottomline: If you like the website, you'll love this book."
4,great gift,"good daythis was a gift for my wife. while getting directions to a shrine on staten island, i came across this book. i tghought it would make an interesting addition to the christmas gifts for my wifei have read it also and found it above average"
5,Forgotten New York,"A must read for visitors and newcomers to this town, as well as native New Yorkers. Can't wait for Part II.mp, a lifelong Brooklynite"
5,Excellent if you are visiting,"If you are visiting NYC or even I supose if you live there, this book would be an excellent resourse. It is packed with interesting bits about the history of NYC. Little did I know that whien staying in Canarsie with friends I was literally 5 blocks from the oldest house in NY State, where teh Duke of York stayed after the Brits took New Amsterdam from the Dutch. yet the log cabin I did see only dated back to the 1930's. Where to find old st lamps, old buildings, what that ""L"" in that subway station in Brooklyn means cause the ""L"" train doesn't stop there..... it's all a fun read."
3,Terrible acting but a decent tight script,"As a made for TV movie on VHS one should not expect too much. Actually the script and general direction is pretty good and the subject matter of great interest. The color and sound are more than adequate. The let down is the acting, especially Topol. He was brilliant in Fiddler on the Roof but here he is stilted and seems to lack confidence. Perhaps this type of drama is just not his scene. The others were no more than acceptable which is a pity as this had the potential to be much better. Despite these faults this is well worth a watch and it is a pity it has not been released on DVD. The Man Who Captured Eichman with Robert Duvall is rather better but both are a good take on a spectacular catch."
1,sticky lashes,This was the worst mascara long lasting or otherwise I have ever tried.The first morning after I applied it my top and bottom eyelashes were literally knitted together so I couldn't open my eyes. The rest of the formula was in two large smudges under my eyes. terrible
2,Slightly disappointed,"The case is attractive, well made and fits the Panasonic LZ5 camera comfortably. On the inside it appears like there are two separate small compartments for holding extra batteries and film. However, when putting an extra set of batteries in one of those compartments, the case becomes too bulky to close. Upon reading the instructions it states that the case is designed to carry the camera only, without any accessories. Perhaps the problem is with the LZ5 model since other users with the LZ3 camera seem pleased. For those who desire a compact case, this one will do nicely. But if you prefer to keep your camera and accessories together, look elsewhere."
1,Wrong Case for LZ3,This case does not fit the Panasonic LZ3 despite what the product description says.
4,MJ rocks!,Must have for a Michael Jordan fan. Kick it old school with this one! Too cool to pass up.
1,Totally useless,"The title of this book is impressive, and I thought it was a book about transaction cost analysis for financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, options, etc. But no, this is some kind of ""general, abstract"" (and IMHO useless) treatment of some kind of ""general, abstract"" concept of transaction cost. In fact, there's no financial application in this book at all."
2,not flattering,"I am a size 12, but decided to purchase the plus size costume based on the reviews of the regular running small. This costume was not comfortable and was not flattering. The waist of the dress was elastic and ""fell"" nowhere near my waist. It was more like at the bottom of my bra. If you have a larger chest, forget about it. The picture is very deceiving."
1,One Disappointed Dorothy,"I ordered this costume to wear to a costume party for a friend's October birthday. The costume arrived in a timely manner, but that is about the only positive thing I can say about it. The costume didn't match the picture online or on the packaging. It said it came with hair ribbons. In the picture on the packaging the model is wearing two blue hair ribbons, the costume that arrived had a headband with a blue and white checkered bow. In the picture on the packaging, Dorothy's checkered apron has a large front panel, not true of the costume that I received. The costume was also supposed to have a lace trim along the bottom and instead it had cheap netting petticoats. Finally, the costume was supposed to be plus sized, and while it had a plus size tag in it, the dress was smaller than I had anticipated. Needless to say, I will be returning the costume."
1,Bad Product,"The package came really quick but I never could get the button to work correctly. It would work for a bit and then die again. I don't think it was the sellers fault, I'm thinking faulty manufacturing, but I wasn't very happy with my purchase."
4,Flowers of Mountain and Plain,The book I ordered came in record time and was in excellent condition considering its age. I was very pleased with my purchase and can hardly wait to use the colored drawings when I paint welcome signs for the historic site we work in during the summer.
3,Worked,Not nearly as nice as press for U-joints but worked on my 81 Vette. You will need a large vise to use so if you don't have a large vice you may want to spring for a small press.
5,Great ball joint removal tool,This is the real deal. I first bought the over-seas copy and had nothing but problems with it. Spend the money and buy a very well made tool that works and will last a lifetime. I used it to replace the ball joints on my 1998 Jeep TJ (D30)(you will aslo need the OTC Jeep adapters).
2,OTC 7249 Was MADE IN CHINA,"OTC 7249 NOT made in usa its made in china i got it because its a otc brand toolwhen it came in, i was happy i looked for were its made and its MADE IN CHINA OTC 7249 ball joint service toolon the box and on the otc lable otc tool made in CHINA the box and tool made in china :( im very Disappointed in OTC brandI Was happy to buy a tool that was made in usa but i was wrong otc 7249 is made in china :( i should have never got itim Happy with amazon but they need to make it a law to tell you were its made so be caution when buying on line from anywere ."
1,OTC 7249,This tool was almost totally useless for ball joint removal and installation. The only components of any use were the collars. The C-clamp is too short and not functual for a Ford Explorer. A piece of Chinese junk that I could have paid half the price for at Harbor Freight Tools. I ended up using a hammer and hydraulic jack to do the job. My first and last on line tool buy!
2,"DIDN'T WORK ON MY '00 CHEVY SILVERADO, RETURNED IT.","FIRST OF ALL, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT AN OTC PRODUCT WOULD BE MADE IN CHINA. AS FAR AS PERFORMANCE GOES, THE HEX HEAD ON THE FORCING SCREW ROUNDING OFF WHILE TURNING BY HAND WITH A WRENCH. I MANAGED TO PRESS ONE UPPER BALL JOINT OUT, BUT COULD NOT PRESS IN THE NEW ONE. AT THIS POINT I THREW IN THE TOWEL. MY ARMS WERE SORE AND IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE. I RETURNED THE BALL JOINTS AND WENT OVER TO MY LOCAL CARQUEST AUTO PARTS AND BOUGHT THE COMPLETE UPPER WISHBONE PRE-LOADED WITH THE BALL JOINT FOR UNDER $100.00 EACH. THE BUSHINGS ON THE OLD UPPER CONTROL ARMS WERE SHOT, SO THIS KILLED TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE, SO TO SPEAK. SHOULD HAVE GONE THIS ROUTE IN THE FIRST PLACE, SOOO MUCH EASIER THAN BUSTING YOUR KNUCKLES WITH A PRESS.I HOPE THIS HELPS ANYONE FACING A PRESS-FIT UPPER BALL JOINT JOB."
1,import from china,"picture clearly shows MADE IN USA the one delivered is MADE IN CHINA if I wanted a $50 chinese copy I would buy from harbor freight. I WANT THE ONE ""MADE IN USA"""
4,Great Tool!,The OTC 7249 Ball Joint set was a great purchase. It worked flawlessly and easily pressed out/in the ball joints on my 2001 Ford F250 . It required the use of various adapters which I did not purchase. I made my adapters out of pieces of pipe and tubing that I had. Excellent tool for the money spent.
5,Did the job,Used to replace balljoints for a 1999 Ford F250 Super Duty Pickup with 2WD Twin I-beam. Worked perfectly. Did have to use some PB Blaster to help break loose the balljoints. Purchased with OTC 6731.
3,Not made in USA,"I bought this tool because I wanted a good strong ball joint press. I made a mistake and bought a Harbor Freight press that survived 2 ball joint removals and 1 install before breaking the ""C"" part of the press. I went to my local Auto Zone and rented a OEM brand press that was made in Tiawan. It looked well used and did the job just fine. I need to have one for an upcoming project so I looked around until I found the OTC press that was advertised as ""Made in the USA"". As a rule I have found every China made tool to be of poor quality. You can see it when you hold the tool, feel it when you use the tool, and cuss it when you break the tool. The castings on this tool do not seem to be of the same quality as the OEM brand tool and looks too much like the broken china made harbor freight too. I have a couple of axles to rebuild very soon and will post if it breaks like all other china made tools... :-("
2,The lid is too shallow to sit down far enough into the saucepan,"When I received my saucepan, I immediately threw the lid away because the rim of the lid that goes into the pot was so short/shallow that it wouldn't stay seated on the saucepan. I have an extra lid in the size that fits this saucepan;I just needed the saucepan so I'm o.k. The pan itself is fine. I have another just like it. It's a convenient size for me. If I hadn't had the extra lid for this new saucepan I'd have returned the saucepan and tried something else."
2,Replacement Product,I bought this pan to replace one I accidentally burned. It had pits in the inside bottom. The seller was very generous when I told him of the problem. I would recommend making purchases from their store.
5,Up North By Sam Cook,"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time about going up north. Fish,hunting,camping, and meeting other people are the best settings in the book. The book makes you feel like your up in the wilderness hunting or on the lake fishing."
2,misses the mark,"I can see quite clearly what Sam Cook is aspiring to here and that is the only reason I gave even two stars. In my opinion he fails to evoke the true feeling of this wonderful part of the country. He also has the irritating habit of refering to himself as ""he"" or ""the man"". People interested in the north woods will be better served by reading Sigurd Olson."
4,WiFi Extension Cable,A needed extra if you use a indoor WiFi antenna. The downside being that it is a bit pricey for a 7 foot cable.
1,A let down,"I was soooooo excited about this product, it sounded good, and the reviews were very good. I tried the diebetic cd first and the video had no sound. Awhile later I was offered the chance to by a program that allowed me to watch the videos, for 10 bucks! Wait, that should be free. It closed on me many times, although there were a lot of food options.Then I tried the vegitarian cd and there were no videos. I was very suprised that for a cooking cd there were only pictures of 17 recipies. My computor expert boyfriend and I tried to use the other features, but found the instruction book to be lacking.I will try it again, but was very disapointed the first time and would not reccomend it."
5,"Don't Be Fooled by the ""Novice"" Review","This book is actually pretty deep - as the basics often are. I have read parts of this book online and it's talking about critical aspects of mind consciousness which I would not assign to the classification of ""novice text."" For example in one section the author describes the ""telling differences"" between the Mahayana and Theraveda understanding of ""craving for transitory aggregates."" This is the type of topic that makes the eyes of most Buddhist I know glaze over - and yet it's a very important consideration in the understanding in the mechanics of consciousness. My take on this book is that it is scholarly and suitable for advance students attempting to deepen their understanding by revisiting the profundity to be found in the basics. Enlightening explanations of Pali and Tibetan terms and the use of obscure but pertinent quotes are all more than I normally expect from a mere ""novice"" text."
5,Delightful,"Geshe Tashi Tsering has the gift of not only speaking English but understanding the Western mind. I have a degree in Buddhist Studies and found this text more enjoyable than any I have read in a long time. Geshe is the type of writer that captivates you and you won't be able to put his books down. Can't wait to read his newest title Emptiness, coming out soon."
2,One Minute Manners: Quick Solutions to the Most Awkward Situations You'll Ever Face at Work,"I was really excited about this book, having read the reviews. I bought two copies as college graduation gifts. I must say that I think they came up short. With the exception of maybe two entries, they were all common sense suggestions. Perhaps if the people I was giving them to didn't have any common sense, then they'd be very helpful! Overall, disappointing."
5,Top of the Line.,"I'd recommend this book to any/everyone. This is the first book I'd want to read before all of those baby name LIST books. It doesn't matter what your name is with this book because the author gives you a quick and easy method to get the numerical combination for any name you can think of or create yourself. You look up the ""profile"" for the combination and it gives the most accurate information. I used this method for my last name and the profile ""fits"" like a glove. This book gives unbelievable insight into people (anything or one with a name for that matter)."
5,Literally changed my life,"When I was seven years old my mother gave me this book for Christmas. That was nearly nine years ago and I've since become an Elizabethan ""buff"" I read everything on her I can get my hands on. This is a wonderful book for any kid who has ever shown an intrest in history or being a queen or a king. Superbly adapted for the younger set this well written and engagingly illuatrated book on Elizabeth I's life is historically acurate. And for me anyway what looks like a life long fascination."
1,Good Queen Bess,It is NOT highlighted that this is a CHILDRENS book. We purchased with expectation of a substantial historical work and have now lost $13 for nothing.
4,good work light,Sturdy and heavy duty. Fairly good balance when tripod extension is fully raised. Light-weight and easy to transport in two sections. Light is bright and clean. Only negative: it was difficult to put the halogen bulb in. I will buy another one of these if I need it.
3,I shot at it,i just bought it to shoot at with my bb gun... BB's would of destroyed it so i made a scale tank round from Q-tips and nails and now it looks like it was used for target pracyice for other mini tanks!
3,Only one came in the package,"I thought I was going to get 3 tanks - which would have been excellent value. But you only get one. It seemed a bit less durable than I expected. I wouldn't recommend it, but I won't send it back -I'm sure my son will love it."
3,Just what I was looking for,I bought these as gifts for my co-workers (not as a child's toy). Excellent quality/value!
2,Great until...,"I bought this pump before my daughter was born. It worked well, though I had to use the high setting as the lower ones were far too low. Out of nowhere after about two months of regular use the suction just stopped. I thought maybe it was just that I didn't have one of the pieces in correctly but that wasnt the case. Pretty soon it started making a very drained sound. Apparently the motor died. It could have been just a faulty pump and not the line, but I did not have a good experience with this pump. Also, though it is a little more costly it is worth having a double pump. Not only is it quicker, but it keeps the flow up in both better."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"I got this pump about 2 days before my baby was born. He is now 2 months old and my pump went out on me. I have had a constant problem with pump ever since I got it, I would never recommend this pump to anyone who wants to pump for a long period of time."
2,Thought it was a great pump...,"I used this pump for about two months off and on. It was working okay. It took me one half to one hour to pump about 4 ounces. It also had a few problems with the milk dropping into the bottle. These were not major problems at the time. Then, just when I needed it to pump exclusively it died. It acted like it was trying to work but had virtually no suction. No matter what we did, we could not get it working again. I would not suggest buying this pump!!!"
5,It really works,"I've had mine since my baby was born which was two months ago and so far, I love it. I haven't had to change the battery so far and it functions very well! It is very discreet, where you don't have to carry around an armload of supplies and it is simple to use, not complicated at all. It was at a very good price and it suctions very well. Haven't had a single complaint about it yet! Why spend so much money? This works just as well as all those other high-priced pumps! AND it fits most bottles that I've used!"
2,evenflo comfort select,"This pump is extremely weak. There is barely any suction. It is also so loud that there is no way to relax to get let down, more or less enjoy watching anything on TV. I would not recommend this product for anyone who would like to pump discreetly. WAY TO LOUD"
1,Ambiguously bad,"This pump worked for me once. It's not necessarily that it lost suction- I still felt suction, but this pump only pumped a significant amount of milk once. The other times I used it, it could draw no more than 1/8 of an oz. I was horribly disappointed, and found myself in a real bind when suddenly faced with a ct-scan and unable to let him nurse for 24 hours. I'm looking for other alternatives now, and I'd recommend that anyone considering this pump keep looking, too."
1,Piece of junk,"This pump is terrible. My son is just 2 months, and this pump stopped working. It made me mad."
2,Terrible item,"This item did not match the exact pump I ordered. It does not have the best suction. It came with the blue button not yellow. The evenflo with the yellow button does wonders, but this one sucks."
3,Worked when I needed it...,"I have this pump since 2007, for my first child. It helped a lot when I was full, but I was combining formula and breast milk, so I didn't have any milk stored in the fridge or anything like that, I just pumped occasionally . Now for my second child, I used it and the power is not as good as it was back in 2007 (understandable)but this time I want to pump ""full-time"" rather than combining, and it is not helping at all. I haven't decided which pump to buy, yet... bottom line.. I would recommend it but for occasionally ""pumpers"" not for moms that depend on breast milk for their child."
4,Works great for us!,"I began using this pump when my first child was born 2.5 years ago and am using it again with my newborn. I've used it to relieve engorgement and pump extra to keep in the freezer just in case. I've never had any mechanical issues . . . in fact, when I pulled it out of storage last week I was able to pump 6 oz. in 10 minutes on 2.5-year-old batteries!My only complaint is that the rubber horn cover doesn't stay put and traps milk between the cover and the horn itself; I removed the cover and just don't use it. It makes no difference in the functionality of the pump itself."
4,Think this works great,"I know this product has some bad reviews, but i think it works great. I am able to get out 2 ounces a sitting and i think that is pretty good for my breast anyway. Always works great each time. And it is BPA free"
2,"Okay, but not great","I received this pump as a gift at one of my showers, and it has been okay. I rarely need to pump milk since I stay home with my daughter, but it is nice to be able to every once in a while if I need to. This pump is loud and it has to be on the highest setting in order for it to work. Mine does not have enough power on batteries, so I always have to have it plugged in. I am able to get about 8 oz in 15 minutes, but lately I think that it has lost some of it's power and I'm afraid it isn't going to last much longer. The good things about it are that it doesn't hurt, and it it easy to clean and use."
4,Works great for me!,I purchased this pump knowing that I would not be using it to pump often - but to relieve occasional engorgement. The pump was a snap to assemble and worked great. I was able to pump 5 oz in less than 15 mins. The pump is a tad loud but didn't bother me. I would recommend this pump to anyone over a manual pump. I was quite pleased.
1,Complete waste of money,"My baby is four months old and I have gone through 3 of these already - I wouldn't of bought the second two, except its the only pump sold with in an hour drive of where I live. It works great for a week or two - then like clockwork the motor burns out very quickly until it doesn't work at all. Have tried getting ahold of the company and have been put on hold every time for much longer then a mom of an infant and toddler can wait. Ordered a different brand online when I had to buy the third one just in case, and thank goodness I did because like clockwork two weeks later motor went out and I added another useless piece of plastic to my pile.Would give it no stars if i was allowed to."
2,It's ok for a few uses,I bought this pump after buying a double pump by first years (read seperate review) to take to work. It was small and seemed to work fairly well at home. When it was used on a constant basis it slowly started to lose suction. Then about 6 weeks after using the pump it stopped completely. I was so glad I hung unto my other pump. This is not worth the money.
1,Don't Bother,"I have used a Medela Pump in Style for two babies, but I got caught in a pinch recently and was forced to buy another pump while out-of-town. Even on the maximum suction setting, this pump barely worked. I had to massage/squeeze my breasts to express any milk. Getting any reasonable amount of milk takes a ridiculously long time and the motor is REALLY loud. I'm sure I would have been better off buying a manual pump for this occasion. I have a newfound respect for the fine piece of equipment my Medela is...worth the extra $[...]."
