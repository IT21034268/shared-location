5,Did he actually see primitive ape-men?,"I really do believe that Rawicz did encounter some strangebeings during his escape. Let's face it that part of Asia was and still is a very remote area. Who knows what could be calling that place home. From those detailed description it isobvious that they saw something.All in all this is a good book.A true tale of courage,freedom and determination with a touch of cryptozoology."
1,Fiction/Non-Fiction,"At several points in the reading of this ""tale of surrvival"", I began to question it's having been purported to be a ""non-ficrional"" account of escape from a Siberian prison camp. It seemed a way to ""perfect"" narration, with all the bases covered:prison toruture, good guards/bad guards, a young female who joins the group along the way (no mention of any lustful interest in this person from any of these men who had not even seen a female for years etc.) When in the tale, they chose to go directly through the Gobi desert, instead of skirting it, I became suspicious. When little mention was made of the parched thirst they would most surely have experienced, I became even more suspicious. I decided to go to Amazon and see what other readers had to say. I was most pleased to read that I am not alone in my view. This is a complete fictional tale of woe. Shame on the publisher for putting this out as a ""non-fictional piece. Do not waste your time on this outright attempt at deception."
1,"Probably, partially, fake","Based on a few internet searches, it seems that this book is at least partially fake. It seems likely that someone did a walk like this, but not certain that this was it. Won't waste my time reading something that might be fiction. I want facts."
3,The Long Read,"I read this in the same month as 'Unbroken' and 'The Forgotten Highlander'. All three deal with narrators who survived physical and mental hardship. This was no exception, but missing was the exceptional detail and personal engagement of the others. In fact, I can understand why many people have questioned the veracity of the story. There's an awful lot of walking, but very little convincing description of the places he's in or indeed the people he escaped with."
5,"Human Endurance, No Limits","Even though the story reaches into the very core of desperation and suffering, the author imparts a sense of determination that draws the reader beyond the printed page and into the struggle for survival, and freedom. The journey across an inhospitable terrain is tempered with insightful descriptions of the hardy people who call this land home. As you cross the Himalayas, glimpsing the yeti, and meander across the Gobi, you can feel the bitter cold, and the broiling heat. Slavomir Rawicz relates his tale with a keen eye for detail and focus. This study in human endurance, and the will to survive, alone, make this a compelling and exhaustive read."
2,"Great story, though sadly a fabrication","I thoroughly enjoyed this book, but was surprised I had never heard of the story. After doing a bit of research, I learned that though the historical context is correct, the events did not occur as described. There was much controversy when the book came out in the 50s, and the story was debunked when Soviet records of the era were made available in the 90s. References to substantiate this farce are too numerous to mention."
3,Interesting but should be fiction,"This is a very interesting story, and although parts of the story may be based in fact, it is clear that large portions of the book are fabricated. It should be read as a work of fiction."
5,A long walk indeed,"I heard about this book way back in the 1970s...I didn't know the title or the author...I finally stumbled upon an original hardback copy in the Ft Dix Army Library...an incredible adventure....kind of cryptic in style (very common for some translated books) but I rate it 5 stars just for the sheer magnitude of the journey.....a rewrite of this book with expanded sections,maps, diagrams and descriptions of the flora and fauna of the route of the trek would be fascninating....also I recommend consulting a very good map when reading the book to thoroughly gain an appreciation of the task undertaken by these men and lady.....properly done...this would make one heck of a movie...which would make ""Castaway"" look like a vacation at Club Med...I would rank this journey on par with Shackleton's Antarctic Expedition of 1914...a fiction book entitled ""the Long March"" captures a trek of Polish prisoners from a Soviet-run Gulag...also an excellent read"
1,Alas!,"I purchased this book in a National Park bookstore. Given its glowing reviews I plunged in and read it in just a few days. It's a stunningread - - well written and understated. Several times during the process I was puzzled; eight days in the Gobi without water, thirty miles per day in rough going, etc. However, so absorbing is the book that I suspendedmy better judgment in the rush to advance the story. Only upon completion did the doubts surface. Upon rereading certain sections, it now seems clear that the story is a hoax. Furthermore, it is written bysomeone without much experience in hiking/walking in wilderness. I alsowondered why the USSR would ""waste"" one year in trying to get one individual to confess before shipping him to Siberia. I leave this to experts on the Soviet Union, but as one who has done just a bit of hiking in warm climates, I can say the ""long walk"" portion of this book is moreof a comic book story than a real one. A pity."
3,Maybe -- Maybe Not,"This is a great story -- it may not have happened exactly the way the author told it, but it has historical truth nonetheless. For a similar story, but one that's true, read COMING OUT OF THE ICE, by Victor Hanson."
5,The Long Walk,"This book made me frightened, hungry, thirsty, cold, hot, exhausted, happy and cry. A great read."
1,HOGWASH,"TOTAL HOGWASH, A FAIRY TALE IF I'VE EVER READ ONE. IT SHOULD HAVE STARTED OUT 'ONCE UPON A TIME.' I DO NOT MIND READING A GOOD YARN BUT THIS ONE TRIES TO SELL ITSELF AS A TRUE ACCOUNT. READERS ARE NOT THAT GULLIBLE. I RATE IT FOUR STARS FOR THE STORY BUT TAKE AWAY THREE FOR SAYING IT'S A TRUE STORY."
5,This book opens your soul to these eight people.,"Don't take this wrong, but after three heart pounding nights, I never wanted this book to end! Of course I wanted them to get to India, but I enjoyed this book so much, I started getting sad that I had fewer & fewer pages to read! -and I had every emotion reading it too. I'll never forget his story. It will be locked into my memory, for me to cherish and learn from, till the day I die. I could read his words every night, but now I've just finished the book, and feel so sad that there is no more ""Long Walk"" to read every night. That's when you know you've just finished a GREAT book! Thank you very much Slav!"
3,A Memorable Story,"I seem to remember there being some to-do about this story being less than 100% true, but the details escape me. This is a harrowing tale, even if it is (supposedly) embellished. Listening to a book always makes it harder for me to remember certain points--like favorite quotes--but one scene sticks in my mind, even if the exact words don't. On his first Christmas Eve in captivity, Rawicz and his fellow prisoners are making the long march north to Siberia. One man begins to sing O Holy Night, and each prisoner joins him in their own language. What an amazing moment that must have been to witness."
4,Engrossin even if maybe not true,"Ever since I read, on 26 Aug 1999, We Die Alone, I have wanted to read this book. It tells a story of a Pole sent to Siberia to a Stalinist labor camp, who escapes with six other prisoners and walks into Mongolia, acoss the Gobi desert, through Tibet, and finally reaches India and safety. The account of the gruelling walk and the horrendous suffering they went hrough is riveting--and, one must admit, hard to believe. And apparently there is substantial evidence that it is not true. But it makes a terrific story and I am glad I finally was able to read it. It is not as good a story as We Die Alone but is still an absorbing book."
3,true story?,I enjoyed this book. I did think that it was true when I started it. But did find it a bit to much for the human body to withstand.But all in all it was a enjoyable book to read and I will watch the movie.And the part about the yeti that is where he lost me.
4,Suspended disbelief,"I really enjoyed this book, struggling along with Rawicz on his journey -in the comfort of my armchair, cozy and safe at home. That is, until I read about his sighting Yeti towards the end, and then I groaned, ""Oh no, why did he have to put this in?"", which is why I took away one star. Of course some of the story must be distorted because it wasn't until years later that it was written and some of it must have had details aimed at selling thrown in, but I was really glad I read it, in contrast to some books I regret having wasted time on."
4,Great Read,"What a great story about people who refuse to die! The story, after a while, seems almost unbelievable and I just kept reading wanting them to all make it. But, as goes life things worth fighting or dying for have a cost to all human endeavors of great achievement. One flaw, which isn't the fault of the author, was how these brave souls ended their story without a conclusion. If you read this book DO NOT see the movie! The movie was a HUGE let down. Quite sad as this story had the makings of Oscar award winning acclaim."
5,Human endurance is unbelievable,"This book was impossible to put down. If I hadn't known it was a true story, I would have thought it fiction. The human spirit and longing for freedom is truly the basis for their endeavor."
3,"Good read, but.....!","If you believe the author, then this is a hell of a story about a hell of an achievement. If it's hokum, then it's not so satisfying a read. The author relates the walk from Siberia to India in a curiously dis-passionate way. The story also lacks excitement & tension. The chapter titles clearly indicate when a member of the party is about to meet his maker. There are no shocks, surprises, serious setbacks, or even villians in the piece. Apart from a little unfriendliness from a wierd European, the group encounter nothing but remarkable kindness & generosity all the way. It's strange! Quite a good read though, but I'm surprised at all the 5 star reviews here."
2,"Gripping, but not true at all....","I was intrigued by this story of a Polish officer taken prisoner by the Russians in 1939 and his amazing journey to freedom by sheer determination and willpower.The book is well written and gripping. It makes the reader appreciate what a human being is actually capable of under extreme conditions.The only problem of this ""true story"" is that it is not true at all. Documents surfaced after the fall of the Soviet Union demonstrate that the author was actually liberated by the Soviets a few years after being captured, and transported to a camp in Iran. The escape, as described, simply never happened.This information was published by the BBC after his death, but it is a shame that he falsely claimed having lived through this ordeal, most likely for profit.It is a good read nonetheless, but to me, it was a major letdown, mainly because the title claims ""The TRUE story....."""
4,Sorry - but when it was over I didn't believe it,"I truly wished that I could believe this was a true story. Somewhere buried inside this tale is a lot of truth. Certainly the horrors of WWII and the Soviet gulags are all terribly true enough.There is just too much to take. I did a search to try to corroborate this story and could find nothing anywhere that interviews the other members or corroborates this in any way.I hope that they do make a movie out of this story since that will force enough attention to try to verify this story one way or the other.I can only hope that it is corroborated and the ""real"" story is the victim of an overzealous and not very competent ghost writer."
1,"Tell me the old, old story","This book enjoyed a great vogue when it was first published in the U.K. However, it wasn't long before it was exposed as a work of fiction, notably by Peter Fleming, Ian's explorer brother, in an article in ""The Spectator"". Fleming knew much of the area well, and the only detail from his critique I can recall after 40 years was the striking omission by Rawicz of his having crossed a road in the Gobi desert, lined with telegraph poles, and carring regular traffic.Gripping yarn, pity about the facts."
2,I Doubt This Story Is True....,"I spent two and a half years living in Mongolia, including time in the Gobi desert. I read the book while I was there. There are no large black snakes in the Gobi (Yes, this is documented; there are very few snake species in Mongolia....), and all of the information about Mongolia and the Gobi is inaccurate to a greater or lesser degree. I have severe doubts about the whole story. Still, if you take it as a work of fantasy, it's an okay way to spend a few hours' free time."
5,Great adventure; great suffering!,"I've noticed some sceptical reviews of this adventure.Boy, there are some cynical people in the world! Are there huge black snakes in the Gobi? has any snake expert confirmed this as a fact or fiction? I presumed that this actually happened. What an incredible journey with such suffering! It's a great testament to what the human body can endure. Read it for that!"
3,"Interesting, but is this a real story or a good con...","I think there is something of a credibility problem. For instance, going for days without water in the Gobi desert isn't supposed to be physically possible. At least it wasn't when I went thru survival school. Maybe it could happen but just too many amazing feats of endurance for me. As fiction, it's a fair read."
5,The Ultimate True Adventure/Survival Story,"I've read quite a few true adventure/survival stories: Into Thin Air, The Last Place On Earth, Shackleton, but never have I read such a harrowing story of strength and perseverance. The real question is, why hasn't anyone made this into a film? Once you start, you won't be able to put it down."
5,an astounding story,this is a story like no other. it is almost impossible to comprehend. how do you stay alive in the desert as well as the snow-covered mountains of south asia? how do you keep walking after you have been without water for several days? you may or may not find the answer in this book but you will definitely be intrigued and entertained.
5,An unfogettable testament to our powers of endurance,"I thought the Norwegian book ""We Die Alone"" was the ultimate narrative on human endurance. However a friend gave me this book and it has been an inspiration to me for over 20 years. This powerful story take place during the most turbulent years of our century and involves huge sweeps of geography, yet remains a very human and intimate story. After reading it, you will never again feel you have reached your capacity to endure, and you will have a renewed sense of what constitutes human dignity. Definitely one of the best books I have ever read."
5,"this was the best book I had ever read, at the age of 13","When I first read this book at the age of 13, I was spellbound by it! It is still one of the best books I have ever read on the true nature of courage and comradeship under severely adverse conditions."
5,The Long Walk,"This is the most amazing story of courage,and adventure, I have ever read. Slavamir Rawicz, a Polish soldier, survives the Russian communist paranoia, is sentenced to Siberia, where he and 5 others escape, treking through the Siberian winter, south through Mongolia, the Gobi Desert, the Himalayias, to India during WW11. This should be at mininum a movie, and better yet required reading by students. I first read it 32 years ago, and found a battered paperback copy recently to re-read."
4,Wonderful story of courage and bravery,"A beautiful sensitive story of true courage. Well written and the plot moves right along, detailing the everyday strugglesto escape a prison camp - stay alive and reach their goal to obtain freedom away from Russia."
3,The impossible walk,As with other reviews this walk couldnt have taken place.With the limited resources they said they had they would not have crossed the gobi desert.Its a load of bulls***!!
2,TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE,"Although I throughly enjoyed reading this book it is a totally unrealistic story. Highly conditioned atheletes in world class shape cannot survive a desert without water, so there is no way half starved prisoners can last 8 days without water."
4,Great story but book is a little wordy,"This is a classic book and one to be read more than once if there was ever such a book. Just a few months ago we wanted to read it again and couldn't find our copy. I ordered another one and have it stashed away for when the time is right. Last time, my friend borrowed the book to read it but I never got it back. It is as good a read as the first time around. I give it four stars for its adventure, and the vivid descriptions. We first became acquainted with this memoir about 8 years ago. My friend sat on the edge of the tv one evening and heard an advertisement about the book. He was so captivated that he read the entire book within a few days. We were so impressed with this book that we told all of our friends and loaned our secound copy out again."
2,It doesn't appear to be accurate.,"I was half way through this book when I realized that the story line just didn't add up. I believe the author has fabricated most if not all of the events that take place. If I had to guess, I would say that it is completely fiction. Having said that, as fiction the book is only average. If true it is one of the most remakable tales, but as stated I believe it is highly unlikely that this book is accurate. I felt somewhat cheated after reading what I did."
1,Disappointing to say the least,"I love history. I love stories about overcoming obstacles against overwhelming odds. I thought this book would be one to add to my list. I will say this, I finished the book against my own obstacles of the obvious errors against truth. First, the author was not part of such a team. We was released from Russia well after he states that this had taken place. That started my slow, but steady disregard for this book. The character, as I will call him, would be humbled by this experience. However, anytime something positive takes place, he is the one responsible for the outcome. The opposite is true when a negative situation occurs, it is always the fault of the other members. Almost everything is glaringly wrong. Yes, the Russians were bad. Yes, they sent millions of people to their death. Yes they used to torture, but that is pretty much where the accuracy ends. If you can get past the issues and look at this book at a purely literary stand point it is tolerable."
4,We are fortunate to live in a free country.,"The Long Walk was a tremendous book of surviors and determination. I found the book most interesting. What the human body can indure and continue to function! What a clever comindant wife, and the fortunate few that lived because of her."
4,The Facts may be a bit skewed but it's still a great story,"I must admit to raising my eyebrows at some parts of this story. The crossing of the Gobi desert with no water for days on days seems to challenge some of basic human physiologic traits. There are other instances where I had also some dis-belief in the claims made.However, It's still a great story. The description of the encarceration and the transport to the POW camp seem quite vivid and I wouldn't ever want to go through it.Rawicz is quite good at telling his story and I came away with the flavor of not only the hardships the suffered but a farily clear idea of the other characters.This is definitely one to put onto the summer reading lists."
1,Made up,"Walking through a blazing desert for days without food or water, crossing mountain-terrain in minus degrees for days without food or water. The author was probably a prisoner who managed to escape a Gulag-camp, but after that the book is made up fiction, and when I read a book stating it's a real life memoir and it becomes painfully obvious it's not true I rate one star everytime."
1,Fake,"Poorly written story of events that never occurred...a yeti? I was thinking the story seemed to fantastic as I read it. Then, you get to the end and the author claims to have seen a yeti/big foot creature. A waste of a read."
3,The Long Walk,Amazing true story... I had never heard of this book before someone recommended it for our book club. So glad I had the chance to read it. Hard to believe what these men endured. An easy read that you will get into easily.
1,NOT a true story!,"This story is a complete fabrication. The BBC did some investigative reporting and uncovered lots of documents that prove this story is not true. You can read all about it here:[...]Sure, it's a fun read, full of action and adventure, with heart-warming characters, scary bad guys, sad moments, happy moments and an uplifting ending. It gives you faith in the human spirit and warms your soul.But, unfortunately, none of it is true. And no matter how many people there are who want to believe it's true, that is still not going to make it a true story.So, I would give this book four stars if the author was not a liar. And it would still be a great story if it was advertised as fiction, which is the genre in which it belongs."
4,Did this happen?,"Firstly, I must say that if you are reading this review you should buy the book. It is an amazing account of the trials that people will go through. Yet, like many others, the tale is too amazing to believe. Firstly, the escape from the actual camp is far too easy. After reading A Prisoner's Duty by Robert C. Doyle I find it hard to beleive that the escape was so easy. Doyle's book is devoted to how hard it was to simply breach the fortifications of even the most lightly guarded facilites. Then Doyle talks about how hard it was to often escape even 100 miles. In this book the escapers not only escape easily but trek about 2,500 miles. To me this seems too amazing to beleive.Even with this though, the book should be read to remind people to be thankfull that no matter how bad life becomes there are far worse fates."
3,Gift for my dad,"My dad has talked about this book for years, having read it in the early 50's. He thinks the story is all factual, which is probably what they said at the time. After doing a little research I found that it is only a little bit factual and that most of it is fiction."
4,must have!,"I have several of these, and they're wonderful: they clip onto a hook on your tool belt, they hold rock solid, and come off easily. The rubber pads do a lot to prevent marring the work, but use blocks on more delicate work to avoid damage.My only complaint was that I dropped one onto a concrete floor and the plastic on the sides came off. The clamp still functions well, but occasionally the trigger falls of at inopportune moments."
5,"Good product, but Amazon is expensive","I bought a set at Home Depot with the same 6 clamps, and with an additional two (8 clamps total, 2x12"" 2x6"" 4x2"") for only $29. The clamps are good, but the clamping strength is not as good as old fashioned steel clamps. The main benefit is the ease of applying some pressure while you work."
4,Very pleased,"I bought these clamps because I could buy all 6 for less than I could get three at Lowes. The four large clamps are perfect. Hold firmly and very sturdy. The two smaller clamps are not very useful. They do not hold very firmly and have an extremely small range, but I felt that the overall price being so low, the two smaller clamps were pretty much free. I would definately recommend this set."
5,Very nice clamps,"Irwin makes a nice set of clamps. One hand to tighten and quick off. Like previous reviewers said, it actually grips better once the bar has some scuffs and wear. A must have for the shop."
4,irwin 6 pc clamps,"got them was better than i expected ,especially from ones in our stores not much good and high price,hubby liked them,glad i invested in them."
5,Irwin clamps,I bought some Cheap chinese clamps that would not hold anything together. Then I bought the Irwin clamps and will not use any other. Works great and really holds the material together easy to release. Awesome clamps.
3,Did Irwin Change their design?,"These clamps work okay, but it seems to me the earlier version of them were a little more stout. I am talking about the larger clamps that you get. The smaller ones are the same. Check them out at your hardware or lumber yard before you order."
3,Irwin clamp review,"The clamps are very handy. I was VERY disappointed to find an eight piece clamp set, same items plus 2 spring clamps,for less than $30 at the local Home Depot, just after I received this item. I paid about $40 for this 6 piece set thru Amazon.."
5,Great clamps - cheaper else where,"These are great clamps, easy to use, versatile and can squeeze/spread 600 lbs of pressure. One end of the clamp removes w/a phillips head screw and can be reattached to the other end of the bar to be used as a spreader.The drawback here is the price. Lowes as of 5/4/11 sells this exact set for 30 bucks."
2,Not much substance here,"This book is only useful if you have PSP and no experience in graphics whatsoever, and need a ""How-To"" on PSP. There is really only 80-100 pages of real text, the rest being filler and cliches like ""Colors make web sites more intereting"", only for several paragraphs.This book will get you started with PSP, but not much else. For example, he does not explain how to correct ""red-eye"" in a photo or how to set the magic wand's sensitivity. Unless you are a complete neophyte to graphics and have PSP, best look elsewhere."
1,Boring,I read a great deal about the Mycenaean period and the story of Troy. I'm sorry but I found this work so tedious that I didn't finish reading it..and I don't intend to.
2,Great answering machine but mediocre phone,"I returned this machine for two reasons. The sound quality of the phone was mediocre. Voices were sometimes hard to understand in typical conversation. This model also lacks an auto answer feature which I think is an important convenience. Also, the handset is a comfortable cradle which is rare among cordless phones"
1,Short Life Phone,"I purchased two of these phones for mothers day. One had to be returned in one month (Could not be heard by caller). Mailed back to Casio, fixed and returned to me. Five months later both phones do not work. Batteries have been checked. Worked very well when working. Working life too short."
2,You can not go home again....,"These episodes have not aged well. They never explain how David was able to wear such nice clothes when he was on the run, and why did the Hulk make-up look like green paint?! Sorry but after so many years, the series must be put out to pasture."
5,A masterpiece,"The pilot film of the Incredible Hulk tv series may very well be the most heartwrenching film ever put to film. To have ""Married"" (another heartbreaking moment realized by series developer Kenneth Johnson) on the dvd is just icing on the cake. If you love the Hulk, pick this up. It doesnt dissapoint."
5,Worth the Wait,"I thought it was about time they came out with the hulk series on DVD. I hope they put Prometheus and the First, both two-part episodes, they were some of my favorites.I grewup watching the hulk and met Bixby and Ferrigno, at different times, when they were passing through Wyoming. Bixby, I met in 1977-78 after the first 1/2 season of the Hulk, I was only 14-16 years old. He was heading up to Yellowstone Park with his son. He was a great actor, and director, I can seriously say he would never be typecasts from the show. He was very talented, directing episodes of Blossom, Goodnight Beantown, The Woman who loved Elvis and episodes of Mr. Merlin.Ferrigno I met when he was a guest poser in the Mr. Wyoming contest. He was on the comeback trail after being retired from competitive bodybuilding for some 17 years. He weighted in at 310 pounds and looked great for being in his 40s.The Hulk series will always be my favorite, there was never a show like it before on television, or since."
2,Just rent it ...,"The DVD features the very first pilot episode (1.5 hours) and the first episode from the second season (also 1.5 hours). The first episode is surprisingly boring after all these years - and too may gaps between hulkism. The second episode is not as boring as the first, but comes close. I was a huge fan of this series in the 70's and know that there are much more exciting episodes than this. I assume the reason they chose these episodes because they were longer in length. I would have preferred three exciting one hour episodes than these ones.DVD SUMMARY:Are you thinking of buying it? That's up to you, but I would recommend renting this first. There are also very few extra features on the disc. The positives are the higher than average film transfer (very clear), and the sound is ok (although not surround but for 1977 what can you expect?)"
4,Original premiere of the Incredibel Hulk DVD,"I watched a lot of episodes of the Incredible Hulk. Although I might not care for a lot of them now, there were a lot of good episodes. Even in the last 10 years with the new releases of Hulk movies, they just aren't the same without Bill Bixby playing David Banner. I wouldn't even say this was the best episode, but because it was the original premiere and explained how the Hulk came to be, it will always be a classic and a must have for any Hulk fan."
4,Nice DVD and series,"All we need is the rest of it on DVD!If you think it is merely 'fluff', take a look at the director's commentary!"
5,Excellent made for TV Pilot on DVD!,"This is the pilot for the popular 70's classic show based on the Marvel comic books. It tells about Dr. David Banner ( Bill Bixby) who studys the hidden strengths that all humans have then he experiments on himself with gamma radiation but overdoses it. When he got angry after his experiment, he transforms into a raging green beast who's really gentle but misunderstood by society called "" The Hulk"" ( Lou Ferrigno).This is an excellent pilot that tells the origin of everyone's favorite green giant, Bill Bixby is truly incredible as David Banner and Lou Ferrigino is great as Hulk with the make-up, wig and silver eyes. The DVD is great, it offers commentary by series writer, director and producer Kenneth Johnson, an introduction by Lou Ferrigno, a look in the making of the 2003 Hulk movie and a bonus episode "" The Incredible Hulk Married"" with commentary by Kenneth Johnson.If you are a fan of the series, own this to know the origin of the Hulk."
2,"Had promise, didn't deliver...","This title had promise when I first saw it. But when I read it, I thought it was written by someone with a severe case of ADD. It jumps around too much and the chapter that promised sex was very weak. At least the cover was inviting."
1,A bad song by another so-called girl group!,"Aren't you people getting sick and tired of listening to all these wasteful Pop girl groups like Dream, Innocense, Nobody's Angel, and now this, 3LW? I heard these girls were trying to be like, the best girl group in the world and sorry, but you gals are far from it! Destiny's Child is by far, the best girl group out there and no one, not even 3LW, can top them! I'm so sick of hearing ""No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)"" that it's not even funny. Even though I absolutely hate this song, it's actually kind of catchy and the beat and lyrics gets stuck in my head. Sure, these girls can sing...but that's about the only thing that's keeping them from totally failing successfully as a group. I suggest that you do not waste your money on this once again so-called girl group and save your money to buy Destiny's Child's new, upcoming album, SURIVIOR. Now here's a girl group that has talent and will last!"
5,A great Scottish band I discovered by accident...,"This vintage Scottish band was featured on a compilation CD of Celtic music I purchased several years ago...the song ""Queen of Argyl"" is the one song that was featured and it made me HAVE to find other music by this band. If you like both traditional Scottish music and more contemporary music with Celtic elements, you have to listen to this group! The vocals are stirring, instrumentation is skillful...I wish I had been around when Silly Wizard was in its heyday. Search out their music...you won't be disappointed."
1,"Saggy, floppy piece of junk",I bought the equivalent of this one for my 8700c about six months ago. I finally threw it away tonight and went back to the stock holster that came with my phone. The elastic became so loose that the holster no longer held the phone - it would come flying out if I bent over to pick something up or did a quick jog across the street. Definitely get one that has some sort of closure or flap. It'll keep your phone in one piece rather than strewn out on the sidewalk.
1,Outrageously-priced shipping,"Don't pay the RIDICULOUS amount for shipping for this item. You can get the exact same product at a better price at www.mybrandsinc.com. Just look under ""O"" for Otter Pops. For the same amount of Otter Pops at this site, it was roughly $12 cheaper than what this guy wants. (For this guy's product, my total was $32 with shipping. At www.mybrandsinc.com my total was $20 with shipping.) This product is a rip-off! If I could, I would give it zero stars."
5,Wonderful Overview/ Great Bargain,"This is a wonderful compilation of the best of many of Callas's exciting live performances.The recorded sound is easy to listen to: I found the sound on the Mexico AIDA and the La Scala MEDEA to be an improvement on the LP's I used to own in the 80's.And my God, the performances! Not to be missed."
3,Filter media not so hot,"This item is not so hot. Usually I try to give Amazon products a good review but I cannot with this one.What happens is this: you put the media in the filter tray and a week later it has shrunk to about 80% of the original size.How in the hell does it do that? ?So, a lot of water running through the Aqueon Sump (see my review of that) ends up not being filtered.I solved the problem by buying bulk filter media and cutting it over-sized by 3/4"". Plus, I lay in 3 at a time (on top of each other). Now, the hand-made media lasts months.My tank is now crystal clear."
3,Good,"I consider ""Hark, the Village Wait"" and ""Below the Salt"" worthy of a 5 star, ""Classic"" rating, and ""Commoner's Crown"", among others, worthy of 4, or ""Very Good"". ""Back in Line"", their 1980's comeback album, is, in my opinion, a ""Good"" Steeleye album, worth 3 stars. Bob's guitar playing and Maddy's voice are in great form on this album. Check out the band exploring some interesting new sonic territory on ""White Man' and ""Lanercost"". Definitely worth owning."
1,Obsolete,"This first edition is long, long out-of-date, and it is high time Amazon woke up and stopped misleading the public by offering remaindered books without so identifying them."
1,This gun is junk,"I have been in construction for over 20 years. I have had great luck with Senco nail gun until this one. I had a old SN1 wish I still had it ( it shot flawless for 15 years),wanted a new one. This gun has been rebuilt 2 times and still jams, doesn't want to shoot and leaking air. Senco has dropped the ball on this gun.Senco make great products but this gun is only good for a boat anchor."
3,Not what I expected,"I got this after returning a Dewalt that jammed on the 4th nail and could not be unjammed. It seemed like a good nailer until I tried to adjust the depth setting. To set the depth, you have to loosen two nuts with the included wrench. The first twist of the wrench and the nut rounded out like it was made of soft plastic. I was finally able to get a ViseGrip on the nut and get it loose. I expected more from a name like Senco. I'm just a do-it-yourselfer so this gun should be fine for me in the future but I would not recommend it for anyone requiring a durable tool."
2,Rather a waste...,"Looks like I'm alone, but I found this book frightfully superficial and entirely lacking in depth. The marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and for that matter, the relationships between the Prince and his mistresses, is glossed over and there is nothing in this book that makes one feel like they have learned anything substantial about anyone. I was SO disappointed, having read many other wonderful books on the subject. This is hardly worth the time or effort to order/read this one."
4,Startlingly familiar music,This is haunting music that most people may not remember specifically but when they hear it again will recall it immediately. Mozart as a child was instantly in awe of this music. He tried to get his hands on the score but it was hidden away as a secret. So Mozart listened and copied. That is how this music first became public. It is not often heard today but if and when you hear it you will be struck as if by lightning. This recording is clear as a bell. The Tallis Scholars are an amazing group. I saw them live in 2006 and note that this recording was made in 1980. Both the recording and their live performance demonstrate amazing scholarship and attention to detail both in performance practice and acoustics.
1,Doesn't make a 90 degree cut..,"Like another reviewer mentioned, my saw is incapable of making a 90 degree cut. Don't buy it."
2,Over priced,This stand left a little to be desired for 50 bucks. The steel is super thin and the base didn't even sit level. I bought a stand at Rockler for the same price and was 10 times better than this model. I'm not sure why it was rated so high on this listing. Almost the same thing you can get a the big box stores for 20 bucks. The only thing going for it is the nice wide roller surface.
4,Great quality for the price,"Crawford WM-5 Contractor's Choice Workmover Adjustable 27-1/2-Inch to 43-1/2-Inch Tall Roller StandThis stand arrived fine. It sits solidly without wobbling. Any wobbling would be easy to fix. I had to bend one tab that holds the roller to get it to align better... not a big deal. The roller itself is plenty smooth enough. For the 24.00 shipped price you can't go wrong with this product.UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER: This product has been used throughout building our home. Been knocked around, and tipped over, and generally mistreated at times with no resultant issues. Good and reliable performer."
3,Like a hired assistant to help you,"...but way overpriced in my opinion. Jet 709207 28-Inch to 43-Inch Tall Roller Stand with 13-Inch Roller, sold by amazon, is $18 and some change and it's shipped free. It weighs the same as the Crawford, same height, same extention reach (sans one-half inch on each end). It even has the same clamp handle.That being said, a workstand like this is like an extra set of hands. I use mine for all my shop machines. folds flatter than a pancake. I used a permanent marker to mark the height to set it on each machine. All I have to do is extend or lower it to the appropriate line mark and wha-la. It is also a safety factor when using a table saw."
5,My child's teacher taught her how to smile w/this book,"My 8-year old daughter came home from school one day, more bubbly than usual. She said that her teacher had a copy of ""How Kids Make Friends"", she read the book to the class, and the children actually took turns at the front of the class, using the ideas in the book. My shy daughter feels much more confident that she will be able to easily make friends, now that she knows how. I bought the book for her and her sister, so they can practice with each other."
3,Good starting point,"I bought this book for my 9 yr. old son who isn't shy but has trouble relating to other kids. I like that this book encourages him to focus on other people, not on himself. (We can all learn that lesson!) It was a good conversation starter for us. I liked the reference to Dale Carnegie's book, ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" which is a book my sons have seen my husband and I read several times! I do however think the book is a bit shallow when it promises kids will ""make all the friends they want"" and that kids can ""automatically make friends"". I think those statements should be a bit tempered. Overall, I liked the book."
1,the most idiotic book in Christendom,"Having nothing deeper to say than ""You should like yourself because it's better than not liking yourself,"" the author happily inflicts such circular inanities on us as: ""You should always try to do the right thing. If you call kids names, start fights, or somehow hurt others, you won't feel good about yourself because you know that you are doing something that is wrong."""
2,"Too much fluff, not enough stuff...","This is a book for kids who really are on the verge of making friends. Who, in reality, probably wouldn't have that much trouble making friends with just a LITTLE bit of effort. Unfortunately, my son isn't one of those kids. He is ADHD with learning and speech difficulties. The kids in his class have pretty much decided that he isn't for them. If he was to ask one of them to come over his house, they would probably say no. Why wasn't that covered in the book? This book is far to simplistic for kids who have real problems making friends."
4,romantic comadey,A good comadey about a family and the youngest daughter who falls in love with the wrong guy (so shje thinks)
2,Eh?,I fell asleep each time I tried to use this. I think it would be better to take a workshop or class. I donated it to the public library book sale.
2,Time consuming,"I do like this product, however I just don't have the time to use it much. The meditation CD puts me to sleep. On a positive note there are ""options"" for listening so you don't actually have to listen to the entire meditation at once. It did help me with starting my own meditation program, however I do it on my own and do not use the CD. The book was a very slow read and I didn't even finish it. I wouldn't recommend."
2,Pure New Age,I give the book 2 stars but the accompanying disc was a waste. A very poor Yoga Nidra experience.
2,Alright as far as it went but.........,"I'm sorry but I must disagree with the previous review. Having read a lot of Texas Brigade memoirs and histories (Polley, Simpson, Bill Fletcher, Collier, Winkler, etc etc) I was really looking forward to this book (and felt I had to have it for my collection). Unfortunately two things let it down in my opinion; firstly, the story only skimmed the surface - alot more could have been done to develop the characters and describe the scenes/events (there is plenty of material in the other factual books I've mentioned). Secondly, there were too many coincidences, i.e. the author tried to involve his main character, or a friend of his main character,in almost every Texas Brigade anecdote/episode/event that occured, ignoring the fact that different regiments and companies could have been (and actually were) involved. Poetic licence is one thing but not when it strains credulity to breaking point. I really wanted to like this book but can only say it failed to deliver."
3,sacco e vanzetti,"item came in perfect conditions,new as stated no problems with payment,shipping but one thing to remark about the description:when i purchased this item i didn't find anything about the fact that it was the argentinian edition of the product.not a big trouble if you're not a collector,but i am and at list i would have liked to know that each title of the soundtrack in the back cover was translated in spanish,even more because i'm italian such as the author and this is the language i expected the titles to be written or at least in english because of the joan baez presence in the soundtrack."
5,old school,I had been looking for a particular song for a while it is good old school r&b the seller promised it new will do business with him again
5,Corning Ware Cover,Have enjoying using my cover to my corning ware. It was just the size I needed.Thanks.
3,A real samba lession~,"This documentary is a wonderful look at the history of Samba and what it means to natives of Brazil.This film has nothing to do with the over sexualized media portrayal of Carnival or it's dances, but is more a discourse on how the Samba affects it's people both past and present. If you are serious about understanding samba and it's roots, you will enjoy this documentary. It also features some great live performances!"
4,At long last....,"Ive been eyeing Pocket Fighter since i first heard about it. At first it sounded like it wasnt so good but im glad i got it because its just what i wanted :)To sum up; this game is great no matter what anyone says. Though its not for serious arcade players.Plus+-12 chara, much more then what puzzle fighter had(which is 6-8?)-Street fighter and Darkstalker chara-cameos of numerous other char(really well animated)-if you like puzzle fighter you'd probably like this tooDownside--graphics are 2D(Looks more like snes. nice but not 3D)-Not hard enough? (maybe for skilled players but seemed like a good challenge for me *shrugs*)-only a few guy chara/mostly girls (i think this would be more enjoyable for girls)-overly cute(if you dont like chibis,cuteness,etc then too bad for you)If you like snes games especially odd and quirky imports then go ahead and give it a try. ^.^"
5,Fan,"I've always been a fan of these games. I tried looking for this on ebay, but had a hard time. If you're a fan of doing combos, or just a Street fighter fan, this a good game to get."
3,you get what you pay for,"I purchased this back in 2003, 6 years later it still does the job. The rings that you grab a hold of ending up bending after a while of use, and their more weak clamps rather than 1 whole piece. The paint on the rails began chipping a few months in, and now all gone.If you are scant for cash, this will get you buy but for long term, I would look elsewhere."
3,Too bad he never finished it.,"Peter seems to know what he's talking about. Unfortunately the book is FULL of mistakes. Peter codes in VB, and the C# translations that he provides were obviously not tested. They were copied and psted from the VB code and only half translated. They don't even come close to compiling. I would have hoped downloading the code from the wrox website would have provided the fixes, but unfortuntatly they rushed this one out, and didn't look back."
1,Poorly written,"Out of all the books I have, this is the most poorly written one. Terms are misused and mixed up in the later chapters (which I realized after further research of my own). No one example that progresses throughout the book. It's like he figured out how this works, did a quick off-the-wall example and through it in the book. In some cases, the information you used from a previous chapter will not work with a future chapter without making changes, if you would have used one example through out the book you would have realized this. I am also giving him one star b/c he felt that he needed to give himself 5, this will bring it down to more accurate rating."
2,Not the most helpfull book in the world,"I've always been a little wary of Wrox books, and this is one that strengthens that opinion.There's a few good tidbits in here, but you have to look hard.If you can get it for really cheap in the bargain bin at half price books, it might be worth it.But then again, asp 2.0 is yesterday's tech...."
2,"Bad book, full of mistakes","I am very upset for this book. As a beginner, I just followed him to create a simple custom control. I found out that things were not gonna happen as what he told me, and the sample code didn't work also. I won't trust and won't follow him anymore, he just mass me up."
1,Do not buy this book,"I'm giving one star to balance unfair author's 5 stars. Poorly written, examples have nothing to do with the content of the book. They are full of bugs and some do not work. The author is not an expert in the subject, he just barely figured out how this things work. It is not programmer to programmer, it's a businessman to programmer. I'm taking the books back to bookstore."
2,"Poor Writing, Slow Progress, Good Examples",The writing is poor and doesn't make the points clearly. This subject is pretty easy so the examples can make up for the poor writing.
4,"Good book, stupid hat","Good book. The author has got to lose that ridiculous hat, though. I was forced to dock him a star because the hat was so distracting. This guy is a great example of why Wrox should leave their authors pictures off the cover."
4,Fast paced read,This was fast paced and entertaining. The story line of one's self struggles was very relatable. I would recommend this book.
4,Amazing POV Change,"I was amazed at the POV change in this book, I had read bad reviews about if from other people, but I loved the charcter change. Being soulmates is Plural- more than one and there are two parts to the Morgan/Hunter story. I loved reading this book"
4,"Seeker (Sweep, 10)",This book was awesome! I liked the fact that it was from Huter's point of view this time and not Morgan's. I am glad that Hunter found his father and i highly recommend any one who hasn't read or as partially read this series to read it because it is very good.
5,hunter-hunter-hunter,i was so so so glad that they finally changed the viewpoint of the story!!! its nice to see what hunter's thinking ! usually all you get is entry's from his BOS! it's a nice change! hunter's a sweety!
3,I Want Morgan,"The book I suppose was pretty good, although I didn't like how it changed its perspective from Morgan to Hunter. The description is incorrect, Morgan is hardly in this book and she does not sense that something is wrong, she's not there to sense it and after chapter 2 the only thing you find out from Morgan is the brief entry before the chapter starts, and from her there are only three. At the end of the book I seriously think that Hunter has gone crazy, but you'll have to find out why. I really hope that the next book in this series is back to Morgan's point of view."
2,Hunter-Your big No-No made me hate this book! Otherwise,"called Hunter keep your lips to yourself! ( And I wish Morgan had cast a spell so green alge grew on them!)Personally this is my least favorite book of the series. Orgins is right behind it, not because it's a bad book but because it was so dark. The reason I don't like this book is simple Hunter ****** another person! Talk about loving the one your with!The only good part was how he helped pull his father back from the land of the dead. It was really sad to read about how his dad communicated with the dead and because of it was having the life drained out of him. His addiction is just like any other and was horrible to read about how it affected Hunter. Maybe He and Hunter could go to I speak to the dead anonymous? Can his son help bring him back into the world of the living or will his father become a real corpse instead of just looking like one? Find this out in this book."
2,Not what is pictured,What I received was not what is pictured. It is all one size brush not a variety pack and they are not nice and even as pictured. They are very scraggly not great for painting details.
1,very unhappy,"I bought this iron yesterday and I'm returning it unused today. The controls are directly under the handle - one would need x-ray vision to see them. If you hold the (hot) iron at an angle to try to read, the writing is virtually too small to be read. I'm very disappointed.Proctor Silex 17520 Easy Press Lightweight Iron"
2,EJB 3.0 not included,"This is probably where the SCBCD exam is, but I was a little disappointed to discover that it only covers EJB 2.0 and not EJB 3. Probably a waste of time for most people certifying on older technology when a new version is around."
4,i got lucky,"i guess i got lucky becuase mine doesnt rock, thank goodness. i had to move the slide bar, that was a little tricky but worked out ok in the end (i didnt read the instructions). since my saw is left tilting i have to use the tool backwards to cut 45 deg mitres. the weight of the clamp arm makes the tool want to tip over so i need to push down a little, my saw doesnt have t slots. the tool was dialled in right out of the box. im using that yellow dewalt job site saw. once i tweeked the blade angle i was able to get perfect 45 deg mitres. i put masking tape on the bottom of the tool because my saw is grey powder coated and the jig was going to scratch that right off. the tool does exactly what i wanted, the price was very fare for the amount of tool you get. im glad i bought this tool."
2,Base Not Flat,"Received mine today. Discovered the base isn't even close to being flat. It wobbled back and forth on the top of my saw. Measured the gap under one corner and it was .030"". That is huge for something that is only 8"" on a side. I called Grizzly and a replacement base is on back order and won't be available for about 45 days.I checked the other flat surfaces and they appear to be much flatter. I haven't checked whether the vertical support is parallel to the miter slot yet, but my first observations on how it is indexed doesn't give me great confidence since it only makes contact at one end of the slide rail. My fear is that it won't remain parallel when you reposition it."
4,Good Price-Just OK Quality,Jig works well. The tool arrived with several chips in finish. Overall a good value.
3,"Good quality, difficult to assemble & terrible instructions","If you like to tinker and enjoy putting things together, then this is the tenoning jig for you. All said and done, it probably took me 3-4 hours to assemble and true to the table saw blade. Instructions severly lacked proper procedural steps to assemble, especially for a left tilt table saw, which I have. It took multiple attempts to square the jig to the blade, but once done and locked, it has stayed true and the cuts are very acceptable.Other than that, it is a solid piece of equipment and comes well packaged and rust proofed with plenty of grease. Plan on doing quite a bit of cleanup with de-greaser & paper towels.I would give it 4.5 stars for quality, but knock a few off for poor instructions and the hassle of assembly and calibration. That being said though, if you don't factor in your time putting it together, it is definetely worth the money."
3,Mostly grease...,"The majority of the tool was covered in very thick grease when i opened the box. Certainly not usable right out of the box. Lots of brake cleaner or carb&choke cleaner was needed to get the tool to where I feel comfortable using it with wood. Not sure why so much grease was used, however i would expect some grease for rust prevention during storage and shipping, but not huge globs. Overall, the tool appears to be well made. I cannot comment on the use and accuracy as i have not used it yet. After i use it, i will probably raise the star rating..."
3,Limited size to cut,"I did not realize this jig would not cut a 2x4 on the thicker side. Partly my fault for not reading the entire description of the jig. After adding the recommended wooden face, it will only cut about 2 1/2 inch thick material. Other than that, it's a great product. I'm using a clamp to attach thicker material to it."
5,Grizzly Tenoning Jig,"I read a lot of reviews before I bought this. I have not been satisfied with the tenons I made on the router table or with my homemade jig that slides along the fence so I was looking for a good jig to do the job.It took me a long time to set it up and understand how and why it works, but once that all got figured out I see that it makes great tenons that are repeatable time after time. Instead of using my saw blade, I used my the Freud Box Joint Cutter blade at 1/4 inch. It made the bottoms of the tenons perfectly flat. It also saved one step in that it cut away all the excess material."
4,So far so good,"I just received the Grizzly tenoning jig. The packing was a bit skimpy and a hold-down lever was broken (they could all be made a bit stronger). They sent a new lever but it took a week or more. The jig is very well made. There are several set screw stops for adjustment. The micro adjust knob gives 0.050"" per turn. I have not used it yet but expect no problems. I will edit this review if there are. The price is so good compared to others that I was skeptical. I almost got the Delta jig just based on price and name alone. But I'm glad I got this one. I highly recommend it."
3,"Decent customer support, questionable product","I purchased the H7583 to assist me in a window repair project that required mortise and tenon construction. I returned the Jig because it didn't fit my table saw guide grooves. I would have tried to make it work, but I noticed that the guide bar that fits in the groove was not parallel to the base and there was no adjustment. I'm not a machinist, but it seems to me this was an obvious oversight in the quality control department. Customer service was quick with the return authorization number. I would give a five stars to customer service. The product is unuseable. Just another ""made in China piece of %$#*!"""
1,I'd give it 0 stars but the system won't let me.,"I have a saw with the specified slot size but the unit rocks. The technical service rep at Grizzly told me he'd never heard of my saw, like this is an important point, and they were not responsible for saws made prior to the start of their own company - even if the slot were the same size. They'd let me return it at my expense, and remember I'd already paid to ship it, and with a 10% restocking fee so to return it I'd lose about 50% of the total paid which the rep agreed was correct. He suggested two things that might work - build up the base around part of bars thickness or have the bar milled. Yes but this will cost me another $20-$25. So the summary is to make this work I need to put money into it. Other tools I've bought with the same specs fit nicely. So much for Grizzly. As a side note this unit was loaded with grease like you'd expect to find on an old car grease fitting. This will be my first and final purchase from Grizzly."
3,too deep for me,"I bought this book simply because I found the subject of synchronicity interesting. Unfortunately this book was way over my head. I forced myself to read every word but I had difficulty grasping what the author was talking about. Ultimately, the one thing that stood out from the entire book was on page 151 where the author is comparing mind to the driver of an automobile. Then the author states that it has been postulated by a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist that there is an actual region of the brain that acts as an interface between the disembodied mind and the material brain. I found this fascinating. Then he talks about mind influencing ""the microscopic processes of the brain and nervous system"" through quantum matter and processes. I would think this would be the root of ""mind over matter"" in cases of unexplained healing of terminal disease for instance. This gem made the difficult read worthwhile. But that is pretty much all I got from the book."
5,One of the most magical physics books ever written,"Peat defines synchronicity as a meaningful relationship between personal psychic processes and events in the objective world. From such experiences, he develops a theory of a creative ground common to both mind and matter where relationships between the two can be forged. A mind limited by societal conditioning can be uplifted under the influence of synchronicity. The meaning and operations of all magick and mysticism may be derived from Peat's ideas."
5,Loved This Book--Wish it were updated,"I first read this book years ago and refer to it often. Peat brought together the latest scientific theories with an indepth exploration of Jung's notion of synchronicity. I am moved to write this review to comment in particular upon the author's suggestion in Chapter 7 that the Universe behaves more like a creative, living organism than as a machine. This struck me in particular in light of a point raised in my new book The Synchronicity Code that suggests that synchronicities occur across time in a manner suggesting that all of life acts as one Being. I would love to know Mr. Peat's view of cycles of synchronicity unfolding across time.The Synchronicity Code: How to Follow Coincidence and (sometimes even) Predict the Future"
4,Pretty Standard Kitchen towel,"I purchased this towel for my wife who has become a huge Houston Texans fan. As far as kitchen towels go there are certainly nicer fluffier towels. but for the price and the team logo it is a fair deal. we brought them with us to the texans game for our version of the ""Terrible Towel"" except it was for the Texans."
1,What A Ripoff!,"THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THIS ANTHOLOGY ""SOMETHING SMALL"" INSTEAD OF ""SOMETHING BIG"". COME ON GUYS. I SPENT A SMALL FORTUNE ON THIS COLLECTION (HOW MANY MORE CAN YOU PUT OUT BURT???) EXPECTING AT THE VERY LEAST SOME OF THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS ON SOME OF THE TRACKS, INCLUDING DIONNE WARWICK, JACKIE DESHANNON, B.J. THOMAS, HERB ALPERT AND CHRISTOPHER CROSS TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS OVERPRICED, OVERRATED ""LIMITED EDITION"". IT'S MOSTLY ALL INSTRUMENTAL AND ANY VOCALS DONE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ON AN INFINITE RIDE ON AN ELEVATOR OR IN A DENTIST'S OFFICE. SHAME ON BURT AND THE RECORD COMPANY FOR CHARGING ALL THIS MONEY FOR THIS NONSENSE. THE MUSIC AND LYRICS OF BACHARACH ARE TIMELESS - THIS ANTHOLOGY IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!"
4,illustration is incorrect,"Joyce Haynes may be a talented illustrator, but she might want to check her facts before she draws pictures about things she obviously knows nothing about. Jane Long (Mother of Texas) would roll in her grave if she knew she were depicted riding sidesaddle on the off side of a horse, rather than the near side."
3,hair pik,I arrived before I was expecting it and was just what I needed. Timing was great. It a very good product.
3,Still Trying,"This is the second little bluetooth headset I have had. I thought I'd wait a couple of years and try again.Some of the problems I am having with this device may have to do with my sprint service and/or the cell phone; that is, I have had interference noise and also people have reported that I sound like I'm in a tunnel. Also, I have occasionally heard buzzing through the set. This is not all of the time.I am happy with the ease of use and also with the comfort. It is light and can stay in my ear a long time before it gets annoying. The device holds a charge for a long time."
3,It works,"This works as well as any I have tried. The connection is faster than my previous model and the sound quality is good.I wanted the ambient sound amplifier but it is mostly a nuisance. There is a constant soft buzz and I don't notice any useful sound modification. I keep it off.I haven't tried the ID to ID feature because the background buzz means I won't purchase one for my wife.As a Bluetooth headset, it is good.I'll keep it and wait for the next good idea."
1,So much for high-tech sound processing.,"I bought a pair of these for my boyfriend and me and am sending them back.Pros:1. The headset fits very comfortably in the ear.2. Small shape, no persistently blinking indicator light.Cons:1. Constant high-pitched squeaks, squeals, pops, crackles and whines. (Both units had the same problem.) For me the problem was much more pronounced than it was for my boyfriend. However, he also could hear it and found it very annoying. It actually hurt my ears.2. Does not allow initiation of voice-activated dialing.3. The advertised USB charger was an adaptor for plugging into a computer's USB port. The headset did not itself have a mini-USB port to allow it to be charged from a mini-USB cable."
2,"Way over-rated, better choices out there, first one defective","Bought this after reading the early ratings here and on Cnet. First one replaced under warranty, company was just OK to work with but a pain to return and cost me shipping. Have tried/tested NUMEROUS BT headsets. The ""environmental mode"" is a total gimmick and in my opinion - worthless. For the money, the Plantronics 510 can't be beat, if you don't mind the bulk or the Plantronics 925 if you don't mind sacrificing a little sound quality to get smaller size."
3,1 feature does not work on this headset,Just received my headset. Love it but must return it due to the redial feature doesn't work with my phone. The button you are suppose to use only works the voice dial feature not both. I'm so disappointed. The redial feature is a must for me since the voice dial doesn't always pull up the correct name the first time. Returning it today. It is a wonderful headset very clear on both ends. Best I've had yet.
2,Microphone in Wind-Not up to par,"I have a convertible so am constantly searching for a bluetooth that will give great sound quality to the ones I am talking to via noise cancelling technology as well as having a loud enough ear speaker to hear them. On the latter this fit the bill. The design fits right into your ear, the most comfortably of any design I have ever tried! No over the ear loop needed. Easy to put on/in, fits great & crystal clear & loud transmission of the conversation.Then there was the test of my microphone with the noise cancellation on max setting. Terrible with wind noise & I compared it to others I had used & also compared it to others I have since bought (my wife is sick of sitting on her phone with these ""taste"" tests). It went back.If you do not need to deal with wind noise, this is a great product; if you do, look elsewhere."
3,Not bad but not as good as Discovery 640,"Fits pretty good in the ear and is fairly comfortable. Sound volume is good, but no real background noise cancellation (talking on the sidewalk, cars can easily be heard roaring by).The reason I bought the SM100 is my Plantronics Discovery 640 earpiece stem broke off (doesn't look easily fixable). The 640 was very comfortable, volume was excellent and most of the time people could hear me. It was also relatively small and somewhat streamlined in appearance.The SM100 sticks out of the ear and looks a bit goofy. Another annoyance I have with the SM100 is the delay time from when I hit the receive call button on my phone to when the SM100 accepts the call. I have to talk into the cell while I wait for the SM100 to connect (~2-3secs?).I did try the Jawbone 2 but couldn't get it to fit my ear and returned it.GaryTech Advisors"
3,Not what I expected,"Does not work as well as expected. Every person I speak with complains that I sound ""far away"". I can hear them just fine but they just can't hear me. Environmental mode is irritating at best. The constant open mic sound is bothersome. It does, however fit nicely in the ear and seem fairly comfortable but just not worth the price. I'm going back to the Jawbone."
3,small and fits secure,Small and compact. Sound amplification has annoying buzz. Battery life less than desirable
4,Small & Stylish Earpiece,"I really like the size and feel of this earpiece. It's not 100% perfect, sometimes, I have to toggle through the different sound options to hear the caller clearly. For the most part the sound quality is okay. My first earpiece was manufactured by Plantronics and I hated the size and appearance, however, the sound quality was surprisingly better than the Sound ID SM100, and the Plantronics model I bought was cheaper. If I had to choose between the two it would be the Sound ID SM100, more so for the size and the styling, however, the sound options on the earpiece provided by Sound ID are pretty terrific."
4,additional info,"there are so many lengthy and good reviews already, so i will only supplement. I love this bluetooth! its tiny and fits on your ear effortlessly. the sound quality is pretty nice and has features like linking up to your voice command in the phone, mute your own side when you are doing something and dont want to disrupt the conversation, and pretty easy link up to phone. It was my first bluetooth and after breaking it due to a spill, i decided to buy it again! its very cheap at only $20. CONS: the ear clip on they provide will break in a heart beat so don't even try. if you have a heavy ear wax production, this thing will fall right out. dont expect to wear this all day as it will fall out of your head. i simply just wear it when i get a call and put it in the pocket when i dont. or get some putty material that hardens so that you can mold a ear piece to it, which is what i recently did."
3,"OK, but has a small sound","It is an ok headset, but not all that it seemed to be. I thought if it were created by an ear Dr. it would have lifelike sound, but it does not. The comfort level was ok for a few hours max, then I had to remove it because it began to irritate my ear. I hope this helps..."
5,Love It!,Wild rice is hard to find and can be very little expensive. This rice is so good and I think it was reasonably priced. If you like wild rice you will like this product.
4,Thin mounts,"The metal that holds the set screws is thin and should be braced. As the screws are tightened onto the spit rod, the metal flexes. I drilled slighty recessed holes in the spit rod for the wingnuts to catch. I also use a set of forks on the rod to help turn the basket. I love the stainless steel as it is easy to keep clean."
1,Fire Magic SS Flat Rotisserie Basket 3618,"There is fatal flaw in the design of this basket. The two holes for the rotisserie rod were too large. The brackets with the locking screws for the rotisserie rod were too weak. As a result, the basket just flopped around or did not turn when the rotisserie rod would rotate. I have a Weber Grill. It took me two hours shaping two short flat aluminum bars one for each end to reduce the hole sizes for the rotisserie rod. The basket seems to working now as intended.I would not recommend this basket until Fire Magic corrects the problem; it is pretty useless in its present configuration. I think Fire Magic offered this basket for sale before they did any testing; this would have showed up almost immediately."
5,Great for wings!,Great product! Love that it's stainless steel. Cleanup is a snap. We use it with our Fire Magic Rotisserie for wings and they come out crispy and great!
5,Fresh sounds from Medieval polyphony,"'Acantus', the album and group name presents Italian medieval liturgical music with a distinct sound which sets it apart from most other medieval music I have heard.I am not an expert on music, let alone medieval polyphony, although I listen to a lot of old music and there is a tendency for it to all run together and sound the same.On this recording, there is a distinctly Mediterranean tenor to the vocals. I will not go so far as to say I would immediately recognize this music as originating in Italy, but I would identify it to being from either Italy or Spain rather than from France, Germany, or England.Some pieces also have an unusual and primative form of percussion I have heard no where else.If you like early music, this album is a very pleasant change."
4,Excellent Overview,"This book delivers on the promise of its title. It gives a comprehensive history of the development and race history of the Lotus Type 78 and 79. It includes several excellent appendices on all the F1 cars made by Lotus and their histories in competition.The presentation is handicapped by the small page size, tiny type face for quotes, and dark black and white photographs of cars under construction. It should be a coffee table sized book with large clear drawings of the skirts and the underside of the chassis and side pods. It also spends too much time on Colin Chapman's management style and the team's facilities.The only drawings of the Type 78 and 79 are views of the complete car. They are very small with thin lines. There are better drawings of the Type 88 in last chapter. The many black and white photographs of the cars during construction do a poor job of showing the key components."
4,Lovely design - Needed some fixing,"Gives off a lovely low diffuse light, and was the perfect height for next to our platform bed. Finish is good quality, and the paper screens inside the lamp are sturdy and a nice natural color. The top was made to come on and off, but wouldn't seat properly, so my husband had to do something to make it stay still - not sure if he put a couple of penny nails, or used putty or something, but he made it so it doesn't rock any more. Floor on/off step switch broke after a year and he bought a new switch (same type) at Target and rewired the lamp. We didn't expect perfection for $99, so no gripes, just a heads-up."
3,Mediocre Lamp,"The quality of the paint is medium-low... but what is worse is the quality of the paper (if it is paper indeed), which is too thin so instead of diffusing the light, you can see directly the bulb glowing. Claiming that this lamp is ""excellent quality"" is a big, fat lie!"
4,"Down the Hatch, or Watch What You Eat","For anyone who ever wondered wherefrom comes our overwhelming need and urge to eat, this carefully researched and interestingly written volume will provide the answer."
2,Utterly fails to prove her point,"Reading this book is like having a conversation over tea with a fascinating raconteur who jumps around from topic to topic without making a single point stick.I was utterly unconvinced of the argument that there are fundamental and irrevocable differences between men and women--relating to food. The author does not prove her point and I found my attention wandering, though occasionally there were little factoids scattered through the book like currants in a bun that served to keep me mildly interested.Nothing in this book is particularly new and all of the interesting information can probably be accessed elsewhere. This was a real disappointment to me."
3,Middle of the road...,"I read this book as assigned reading for a Measurement and Evaluation course. After the sticker price shock...I started reading. The book is divided into 3 sections:1) Introduction to Evaluation,2) Tools of Evaluation,3) Development of the Evaluation Plan and Implementation of the EvaluationThe text has LOTS of information on the history of program evaluation, and how summative evaluation came into being. It is heavy on theory, but there are lots of practical application parts as well. There is also an excellent chapter on ethical issues in evaluation.If you're looking for a How-To guide on designing and implementing a program evaluation, then this text might be too much, and I bet you can find a cheaper deal elsewhere. If you're interested in more of the history and theory of program evaluation, this is your dream text."
5,The Powerful Intersession of Good St. Anne,"I have owned this booklet for several months now and purchased it after making a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. Anne near Quebec. There I received an awesome miraculous healing from Jesus through the powerful intersession of His Grandmother, Good St. Anne. The first half of the booklet is filled with a history of St. Anne and the Shrines in her honor. The last part of the booklet is filled with many prayers in honor of St. Anne and to obtain special intentions through her powerful intersession. I used the booklet on a regular basis and I feel certain that you willalso. I feel confident that you will find much comfort in the pages of this booklet and that you will benefit very much from many graces you will receive from God through the intersession of Good St.Anne, mother of Mary and grandmother of Jesus. God bless you all."
2,"outdated, boring and lacks information","This was not very good. We were hoping to get some real information as we are considering retirement in Panama but it seemed geared towards really old people that don't know anything about the country (hey, we are way past 40 and 50, and we were not the audience for this!). Very weak, may be good if your 100% ignorant about the country."
4,Nice collection of holiday tunes,Another in the series of Steve Vaus benefit albums. There's 20 songs. My favorites are:The Bells of St. Victors - Andrew GoldWe Three Kings - The Beat BoysThe Best Christmas - Christopher CrossJingle Bell Rock - Stephen BishopAngels We Have Heard on High - CommodoresThis Christmas Day - Nicolette LarsonAway in a Manger - Willie NelsonWinter Wonderland - Harry Connick Jr.Run Run Rudolph - Kim CarnesA nice selection. Kim Carnes belts out a rockin' version of the last song. Get this CD if you see it in the stores.
1,rofomagus review,"well if tis book is true all i can say is aleister crowley whould ntmade apimple on carlyes ass. very informative on the occult in general and gives good insight into black magic in the fifeteenth century.but carlylyle wasnt a devil worshiper like anton levay he was after power,power on a scale that has never been seen sincedont think there will ever be another one like him. it is scary to think what would have happened if he didnt get his ass burned alive while trying to summon a demon he could not control and his spell book survived"
4,The actual lenses colour is different from Amzon pictures,"I bought one to my wife. However the actual lenses colour is different from Amazon pictures. The color showned in Amazon picture is much nicer. Anywhere, my wife still feels happy to own this pair of sunglasses. :-)"
1,Not Much About Massage,"If you are pregnant and ""expecting"" to learn about how massage should be performed on pregnant women you will be sorely disappointed. The contents are mainly a rehash of all the pregnancy information you will have probably read in other books specific to pregnancy. ""Massage During Pregnancy"" focuses largely on the business aspects of the massage industry and contraindications for massage during pregnancy. In effect, it does a good job of teaching what should not be done and nothing at all on what should be done."
5,I believe!,"I am thrilled to find the best healthy eating book to fit my lifestyle! I finally found the program I can follow and believe in. I am never hungry and finally have the energy to enjoy walking. I am learning basic principles to teach my children healthy food choices. Best of all, I get compliments from my friends that are sooo encouraging! This is the only healthy eating book you will ever need."
3,Misleading,"The gloves seem to be a good product, however the purchase was misleading. We thought we were receiving a pack of three sets of gloves when in reality it was one set of gloves."
1,.39 for the gloves and $6.08 for shipping?,"I was planning on buying gardening gloves for my young son, but this really got my ponytail in a knot...To the seller - why not price the gloves at a reasonable price and then offer free shipping?It is extremely misleading to price it so cheap and then overcharge on shipping.You can ship these for a buck or so...if I pay 15 X for shipping what something costs I need my head examined."
5,"Finally got my ""out of ink"" message cleared","I read other reviews regarding other compatible cartridges which didn't work for the existing printers and keep getting the ""out of original ink"" message. I decided on this cartridge and it cleared it. The high yield seems to be lasting a good amount of print outputs. However, the pages that I print are very light in terms of required ink per page but compare to the standard ones it lasts a lot longer.I wished the cartridge prices were cheaper but I guess here is where the printer companies make their big bucks. I am going to use this cartridge container for refill again. I have done that with the standard one that came with the printer when I purchased it. I used the original cartridge for couple of years but it finally gave up on me and had to purchase a new cartridge."
2,Uncovered tape over ink cartridge,"When I received the Lexmark #34 High Yield Black Ink Cartridge, the tape over the cartridge was loose and ink covered the inside of the pouch the cartridge was in. I went ahead and inserted it in my printer with no problems sofar."
5,Just like the real deal!,This product is just like the original ink; no difference as far as I can tell. It is a great buy. My copies are dark and legible and the ink lasts a long time. I really cannot tell the difference except in price. I do recommend it. The price is right and the product is worth it.
2,High Yield?!?,"The cartridge works fine, but seems to drain awful fast for a high yield cartridge. Also, this is designed specifically so you cannot refill it yourself or at any local shops to save money. I'd avoid printers that require this cartridge if possible."
2,Will not buy again,"This was a refurb. cartridge. Ink ""laydown"" while printing poor quality. I will go locally to Cartridge World for refurb. cartridges in the future that way if i have a problem i can return it. Doesn't pay to ship back to Amazon such a low $ item."
1,Apparently EMPTY printer cartridges.,"Purchased two of these - arrived quickly; HOWEVER - after placing them both into 3 different new Lexmark printers, all 3 printers reported that the cartridges were EMPTY, and would not use them. Had no Lexmark markings on them (Supposedly ""remanufactured"", but apparently not correctly).Looked like a good deal on Amazon -claim to be ""Lexmark cartridges"" - but not worth the postage.DO NOT BUY THESE."
1,Disappointed,"This ink cartridge is not living up to expectations, to say the least. I purchased it (a high yield cartridge) instead of a lower-yield cartridge, presuming it would last a long while. Well, it has not, and I do not print out so much that it should be used up already. I am assuming this cartridge is either faulty or was dried up and so I have not had the use of it I should have. I will now have to order a new one, and will not order this one again.If anyone else has had trouble with Lexmark ink cartridges, let me know."
5,Brand name product,"I have purchased quite a few ink cartridges for my printers. Over-all, I have found that even though you can get recycled ink carts for less money, in the long run, new, brand name carts are a better bargain. They perform better, and you don't have to contend with messages on your screen to bypass everytime you start up. I've had two refills just lately that would not even let the printer start up. message comes up that the cartridge is missing. TAKE MY ADVISE, stick with the ink your printer calls for. You'll be happier in the long run....."
5,Lexmark Printer Ink,"Yes, the OEM ink is better and the high volume, more expensive cartridge is worth the extra money."
4,Work pretty good,For a couple bucks more over the regular black cart's the high yield seem to last a little bit longer.
1,bad ink,"this item came with the tape off in a brand new ink,it will not print clear,all attempts to remedy failed."
2,exactly what you need,When needed the right product at an incredible price. It is worth to search for specific items and compare prices. This surely has been the best by far.
1,High yield costs more for reduced quality (not more ink),"It appears that the high yield functionality of the #34 cartridge isn't such a great deal after all. Rather than providing more ink, Lexmark has just dialed down the amount of ink dispensed per print. What comes out crisp black with regular #24 cartridge appears dull gray with the #34 (we compared prints). Even worse, the quality settings in the printer software don't allow you to choose higher quality. As if these cartridges weren't already enough of scam now Lexmark will let you pay more for a lower quality product and not even make this difference clear in the product description."
1,WRONG ITEM,"This is the 3rd time I've ordered this item. It is NOT 'HIGH YIELD' it is 500 pages.It is NOT in a 'RED' box it is in a black box. I'm going to keep it anyway, but I will never order this item again!"
3,May change printers.,"I have used the Lexmark X3550 for several years. I have purchased this ink cartridge from many different sources. The cartridge works fine and provides clear and clean documents, but it seems that the ink runs out faster than other cartridges I have used. I only use the printer at home and normally for one or two pages. Yet, my last cartridge only lasted a little more than two months. So, I am in the market for a new printer that does not use as much ink. I was sorry to hear that Kodak is no longer making printers. I have one that never seems to run out of ink."
2,Dissapointed,"I have read so many good reviews on this product, but I have had so many problems with it. It keeps giving me a cartridge error and I have to open the printer and remove the cartridge and put it back and it prints a alignment page everytime. It is so frustrating because I can never just print things. I don't know if I just got a faulty cartridge, but I cannot recommend this Ink cartidge."
2,ink,"The ink is pricey, but can print more paper than the normal ink. The high Yield ink meets my printing needs."
5,received in new condition and works good,"I received this lexmark replacement black ink cartridge in new condition. After installing the ink cartridge in my printer, it worked excellently."
5,Work's good.,"I ordered this as a replacement chain for the Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Pole Chain Saw, 8-Inch Bar #NPP2018 that you can also find on Amazon (link).Black & Decker 18-Volt Cordless Pole Chain Saw, 8-Inch Bar #NPP2018I didn't find a reference anywhere that it would work on the battery powered saw, but I figured since it said 8"" that I'd try it. I don't know why they don't have a replacement chain recommendation. This one works.I use Oregon chain on my other bigger saw and I'm happy with the manufacturer."
5,Chainsaw chain,"Thank goodness for Amazon! Couldn't find the chains for Black and Decker's wonderful battery powered chainsaw. They sell the saw but no one carries the chains. This fits perfect on that saw! Same as Black and Decker's chain. Nothing 'lite"" about it. Does the job perfectly. Shipped fast. Exactly as described!"
3,Nice but inconsistent,I like everything about this gun except it often doesn't sink the 16d nails. It is nowhere as good a gun as my Bostich or the Hitachi I owned 10 years ago.Since sinking nails is the name of the game I say don't buy this gun.
2,Not worth it - Get a Hitachi,"I got it brand new from Home Depot last week. I bought it because I need a nailer to build my shed and I have heard Senco is the nailer of pro choice, and I expect ""you get what you pay for"" as this model is not cheap.It only shoot less than 600 2 3/8"" nails in the week. It jamed once in the first 100 shots. (OK to me.) Then the problem started developing more seriously. At the end, it jammed 3 times in 10 minutes. I couldn't continue my work. I hammered some nails manually and send the unit back to Home Depot.BTW, I bought Hitachi NR83A from HD afterward. It is very reliable, lighter than the above Senco, and even...cheaper. Highly recommended.Eric."
2,buy something newer,"Not a bad book. A bit rambling, but has some good stuff in it. It just shows its age too much - and the title is profoundly misleading: nothing to to with Imagined Worlds. It's all about how scientific progress looked like in the early 1990s. These days, of interest for historians of science only. Freeman Dyson has many recent, thought-provoking essays out there in the web for free. Read those instead."
2,A Weak Unoriginal Apology for the Status Quo,"Other than its thin sprikling of brief anecdotes about the history of science and technology, this book is pretty much empty of content. Most of the ideas considered have been lifted from dead science fiction writers (notably Olaf Stapledon). Freeman Dyson totally caves in to organized religion, and even repeats the often-heard canard that Western Civilization would have been impossible without Christianity and the Bible. The latter thesis is patently absurd. One need only consider the contributions of the civilizations of Greece and Rome. Neither one of which, as far as I know, rested on religious beliefs erected about the bizarre spectacle of a crucified Jew who was somehow also a god."
4,"Tough puzzle, gets easier","This double sided puzzle is quite tricky. It's definitely one to show off to your friends if you can complete it.It took me several weeks to complete. It can be a bit frustrating, as you can't tell which side is which. It is easy to put a piece in the wrong spot, and it looks like it is in the right spot. Tough to lay out all the pieces, because you don't know which side to put face upIf you figure out the trick to this puzzle, the double sided feature actually makes it a bit easier.One of my favorite puzzles I've done."
3,Not that difficult,"I haven't done this particular puzzle, but I have done others in the the ""World's Most Difficult"" series. The way the picture is printed on both sides actually makes the puzzle EASIER once you figure out the secret."
4,Christmas Light Business,"Since I am in the business of creating beautiful displays for my clients during the holidays and Christmas, I always look for inspiration and this book is worth taking a look at - [...]"
1,not worth the cost!,I was wanting advice and info on where to buy lights and stuff...this book did not have it! save your money!
4,Pope John Paul II,This was a very informative book for children. I plan to put in in our school's library. It has information on Pope John Paul II from his birth until it was published in 2000. It has many color pictures. It is a very nice book.
3,Interesting and Thought provoking,"I found this to be an interesting and thought provoking book. However, I think the reviewers of this book overdid it. I didn't find this book to be the end all of information about Christ and his life. I didn't find this book to be the most spiritually provoking book. It is just that- a very interesting and thought provoking book."
3,"Interesting read, but falls a bit short","I enjoyed reading this book, but I was a bit disappointed that more wasn't written about Jesus and his family. It is written here that the Master's mother was of some high order, but it doesn't go into further detail. There is also not much mention of his father. They also discuss many prayers and meditations of the Essenes, learned at the KRML, but don't go very far to describe any of them.All in all- a good read that leaves me wanting to read more."
1,"""International Law Perspective"" Without International Law","As a student of law, I borrowed this book anticipating arguments about Palestinian statehood deeply founded in international law. I looked for references to key principles, decisions and treaties - to no avail. For a book that purports to give an ""international law perspective"" on the Israeli Palestinian conflict, this book contains remarkably little legal content, and rather too much dubious historical commentary. Seeing as it fails both as history and as a legal analysis, I'm left wondering whether this book has any merit at all.If you value you time and money, avoid this book."
4,Great detail,The lap track is a additional piece for expanding the tracks with amount of lap was complete.I would recommend the lap track.
5,Restoring Movement and Eliminating Pain,"This is a wonderful book for anyone looking to re-gain movement and health. In addition to the helpful content, it is also a beautiful book full of color and interesting photos and illustrations. Keep it in a prominent place in your reference library. Better yet, put it in your gym bag!"
5,Great slide guitar tuition in standard tuning,"Learning slide guitar in standard tuning is a great way to add another dimension to your guitar playing with the benefit of not having to retune your guitar. That's not to knock open tunings, they are great too, but playing slide in standard tuning allows the player to use all of their knowledge of scales, chords etc when playing slide. A highly recommended book by a great guitar player and teacher."
3,lick book,A mediocre lick book. No explanations of what he's doing. The licks presented are mostly not very interesting.
3,did the job,"After doing some modification to the tool, it compressed the spring well even with the cheap plastic turn handle. You could put a ratchet on the end if you like. Problem with it is it would not stay straight on the retainer while compression the spring so I just tack welded a washer that fit perfectly over it and worked well."
3,"A good overview, though nothing specific","This was a good read, though it was not as technical or as specific as I was hoping for. O'Reilly books are known problem-solvers, and this text was a good one for the beginner. I was aware of the problems my group was facing, and it was nice to find that the problems had been previously tackled. I looked at it as a ""consultant"" of sorts, a book to hold my hand and take me through the pitfalls and benefits of all solutions available. I would have given this text a higher rating had it provided more practical and hands-on solutions to the problems faced. This book was closer to a ""for Dummies"" book than it was to the usual O'Reilly bible, and I was a little disappointed."
3,Stevia,"This is a handy product because it is so convenient to carry in you wallet or pocket for access to a good sweetner. I have to mention though, even though it says no bitter after taste, that licorice taste is still there."
5,Perfect for beginners,This book is the absolute perfect way to introduce yourself to the kitchen. It goes into detail about things that other cookbooks just assume everyone knows like: what the difference between a steak and a fillet? and what type of cooking pan do you use for what? Also the recipes are very simple and actually very tasty. Mastering this book will make you much more confident in the kitchen. I highly recommend this book to anyone new to cooking.
5,Wonderful book!,"What a wonderful book! Being a newlywed, there are many things about cooking that I didn't know, but now I do thanks to this book! I love the detailed instructions, the pictures, and the breakdown of the recipes! I'm going to save this book to pass on to my future daughters!"
4,Good book to have in your kitchen,"Being a recently divorced man without much experience in a kitchen (Grilling and BBQ - yes, Kitchen - no) I appreciate this easy to read and understand cookbook. For a beginner its great."
5,A must buy for beginner's cook,"This is a very good place to start if you want to learn how to cook. I bought this when I first learn to cook. The list of basic kitchen equipment and the measurement conversion table is really something really beneficial when you are a beginner, give this book a try and I know that you will be able to learn a lot from it. If you are seasoned cook, this book might not be right for you."
4,Betty Crocker's Cooking Basics - my opinion,"Great book! I bought four for gifts, and decided to keep one for myself. It's a great reference for the seasoned as well as the novice cook!"
5,Confidence-inspiring,"I've decided to change my bad attitude about cooking and this book is an excellent tool to gain confidence and knowledge. The recipies are clear, easy and don't take a lot of time; the results are delicious. Lots of pictures and explanations. Highly recommend for the beginner and the formerly cooking-impared."
4,Betty Crocker to the Rescue,I have had this book for many years and decided to get this for my daughter-in-law who loves it. It simplifies what you would think of as complicated recipes and makes healthy eating a reality. The presentation of recipes is great with pictures and many important tips like how to measure basil leaves. Also there is everything in this book...even tiramisu.
5,Traditional Cooking,"This is a great beginner's cook book filled with basic recipes with common ingredients and well known choices. Anyone can cook, as the clarity of the recipes are simple, and the break down explanations of necessities and details are pictured and labeled step-by-step. Some of these pages include details of what a sauce pan is, to how to cut a pepper correctly. Even if you are not a beginner, and just need some great common American recipes you grew up with, this is a desirable book to have! Although, some recipes you will find through practice, you will want to change a few things to your own taste liking, but if directions are followed, you will be successful!"
4,I love this book,I recently bought this book and it is so nice I fell in love with it. It is simple and I was able to cook all of the receipes that I tried in this book. My friends love it so much they always want to borrow it so I decided to buy two more one for each of them. This book is the bomb.Betty Crocker's Cooking Basics: Learning to Cook with Confidence
5,Super Spy,"This is a good spy book for biginners, but has some stuff that you may not allready know! Of course, this book says make sure you have a parenet around to do everything with you. I reccomend ages 7-12."
3,comedy value,I purchased this book as a gift for a friend of mine for Christmas. He has recently started working for the Government and we have decided that he is in fact a spy... he loved the book and has promised to read it thoroughly to aid him in his 007 work!
5,great fishnets!,"They last forever and the stay up without a garter belt! The last pair I owned lasted 2 years before I had to replace them (because my heel caught on the nets a tore a hole). These are my favorite pair of fishnet stockings, hands down."
1,it looks nice but doesn't work,5 months after i bought this product it stopped working. sonic blue would barely exchange it for a recondioned unit. let the buyer beware. but this at your own risk and the risk is high. reviews all point to lots of these units not working!!!!!
2,"Great jigsaw experience, but touring the train crashes!","Loved the assembly portion of this puzzle, but when I did the Superchallenging level and finally got to tour the train, but I have WIndows 7 and the program crashes as soon as I start the tour. Every time. So sad."
3,3d puzz,"This is a great game, Too bad it wont run with windows 7. Tried all web sites for information on running it, but nothing works."
3,limited coverage!,"This is a good, sturdy map but, on Havana side, covers only the old city to Vedado. You will want another map if you want to visit anything outside of this area, and it is VERY likely that you will. In Havana there are excellent maps available at the airports, in ""tourist"" stores near major hotels, and in bookstores."
3,beautiful british columbia,this is one of the few books that i've found on british columbia if you are interested in the beauty of british columbia
1,"Unclear, poorly written, vague, monotonous","I attempted to read this book after buying it from a bookstore. I found its style to be unclear and vague; ideas aren't developed. It isn't persuasive at all. Rather than a clear, concise, objective look at the issues facing the young electorate, I found the book to be largely a soapbox for the author to rant about how seniors get all the taxpayers' money (via Social Security and Medicare). I promptly returned the book.She basically repeats the same things over and over: that young people pay more into the system and get very little out of it. The disproportionate amount of money going towards seniors is an interesting issue, but I've basically summed it up for you here; there's no need to buy the book.I might even had agreed with her had she not gone on and on about it. It just frustruated me and discouraged me from reading it. ""We've Got Issues"" truly seemed more like militant propoganda than a ""No B.S. Guide to What Really Matters."""
3,First J. Renee,"Nice style, soft cushion with flexible fabric but even though I ordered XW, they feel like size M. Usually I wear M or W for other brands. Maybe I have really really wide feet."
3,great way to get your point accross in email-include voice!,"The digital voice tracer is a pretty cool device. It works well with my laptop, which I keep with me while I'm on the road. I can record stuff I would normally have to type into an email, and when I later sit down with my laptop, I add my voice (wave file) with the other information I need to send along in a an email. Neat idea."
1,An anti-Israel polemic,"Sadly, the only thing this writer got right was that the attack was deliberate. It was. But not for the reasons the author describes and not in the way he says. Better accounts are written by Bamford, Gerhard, Findley and survivors. Not by Cristol, which is itself polemical in a different direction."
1,Is refuted by recent US documentation,"Interestingly the latest declassfications (especially NSA intercepts) show that the US knew in short order that Israeli forces did in fact believe the ship was hostile. It is a shame that the myth of an intentional attack has become more of a story than the heroic efforts of the crew.Friendly fire incidents are terrible. We shot down an Iranian airliner, killed Canadian troops who were where they were supposed to be in Afghanistan, etc. But to manufacture motives, especially contrary to the facts, is not really helpful."
5,Great bike holder for one bike.,"This is a great product, but the poor quality photocopied instructions could be a lot better.It is basically a side clamp that fastens to the side of your truck bed and holds the bike upright. The front tire is then cinched to the bike frame with a strap. I didn't think this would really work until I tried it, but I drove around like normal, and would forget about the bike in the back.. but there it stayed. It is much easier than a bike rack where you would have to take off the front wheel every time.It comes with a cable clock which is to lock it to your truck tie-down hooks to prevent theft.A second bicycle is clamped to the first bike with a bike-to-bike clamp. I am not sure how well this would work as I haven't tried it."
5,Awesome product!,Love this bike rack. Easy to install and holds bikes rock steady. I used in the bed of my Chevy silverado. Drove several hundred miles and bikes never moved or shifted. This very simple apparatus is compact and holds bikes on one side of the pickup bed so that the rest of the bed still has room for other stuff you need to carry. I am so glad I bought it. And the price was very reasonable. An excellent product.
3,"Sturdy, but won't work for all bikes.","I have a 1996 Nissan Hard-body truck. The attachment fit on quickly and snugly. My bike is a Diamondback Kalamar. The clamp barely fit on the tube, but once I got it on, it held the bike very securely. The clamps are designed for smaller tubed bikes. My wife's bike is a Diamondback Vital. Because the top frame tube bends down over the bottom frame tube, the clamp can not connect. Works great for the one bike."
5,Topline Uni-grip,"If you are looking for a simple but effective bike rack that is easy to install, this is the item you want. It requires less than 10 minutes installation time and works on any truck. A lock is also included. Unlike other bike racks that require the removal of the front wheel for anchoring your bike, the Uni-grip clamps to your bike on the down tube or seat post. It's a firm connection to a hard point on your bike that will not cause any damage. There is no front wheel disassembly and re-assembly, and the bike remains in the standing position during transportation. I've used the Uni-grip every weekend for two months, and I have not encountered any problems."
3,"Ok, but doesn't work with tonneau covers",I purchased bike rack in addition to a Truxedo tonneau cover for my 2007 Nissan Frontier. The clamp is not adjustable so the product would not work with the tonneau cover installed. FYI...drilling a hole into truck bed is required.
1,Buggy and unreliable,"I had nothing but problems with the Formac Studio TV. It was very difficult to get the Mac to ""see"" the device. It had to be plugged into a certain firewire port and wouldn't work if certain other devices were connected. When I upgraded from a G4 to G5 it wouldn't work at all. The software is very particular - if it doesn't see the hardware immediately, it halts. Don't waste your money or time - check out the Canopus ADVC convertors. I got the 300 and it is awesome."
4,YAAAAAY combo of heatstyle & Guts style,"I own this toy and despite the comments about durability from ""Duelistq"" the one i got was very durable. perhaps he has the japanese HG (heaguts.)This one has both his main weapos Gutsfist and heatbuster which are well made. the projectile goes far. i was dissapointed in th articulation. there was enough for play. the joints only move forward and back, the legs dont go sideways (like straddle split.) and his neck is kind of stiffoverall it is a good toy"
4,just a toy : ),AN AWESOME TOY HEAT GUTS HOW COOL CAN THAT GET THIS DUDE IS AWESOME HES BETTER THAT THOSE TRANSFORM FROM M-MAN TO SOME SOUL LIKE METAL SOUL OR TOCRH WELL WHATEVER THIS TOY ROCKSHE HAS A HUGE FIST TO PUNCH AND KNOCK OUT PROTOMAN OR OTHER ENEMIES OH AND HIS M-CANNON THATS COOL USE THAT TO SHOOT PROTOMAN OR SOMEELSE THAT GETS IN HIS WAY! IFYOURE GONNA BUY A TOY GET THIS ONETHANKS FOR READING : )
5,Fun,"Not quite as fun as I remembered.. but hey, I guess 10 years of newer, better graphics might do that. It's still fun! Brings back a bunch of old memories."
4,Good book for highschool students,I'm taking a course on competitive problem solving at a local college for high school students. We are starting out by going through the series of geometric transformations by Yaglom. The lessons are quite easy to understand and the problems are very good. I started the books without a clue on how to start the problems and now I can solve pretty much all of them... so the book must be doing its job pretty well.
3,Could be Better,"I ordered this set from Amazon , to my surprise set is made in China . Set appears to be of the low quality - half of the bits have spots that are not covered with green oxide . Oxide treatment prevents overheating and increases bit life . Because some bits have spots in the middle I don't expect them to work for long time . Case is build well , however its to large for 15 bits . I think they use same case for bigger sets . Overall, bits performing well , however below expectaions . Dewalt oxide covering does not have missed spots and more uniform"
2,It's not thrilling to me.,"The acting is okay but the movie is not thrilling to me. The action scenes are so so. Overall, it's not interesting."
4,"Very good movie, few complaints","I found very little to complain about in this movie. Some say Nicole Kidman is too young for the role, I believe it was mentioned in the movie that she was acting Director of her department so no problem for me there. I do think that Colonel Devoe would probably end up in Levenworth for his methods, our military brass doesn't like that sort of soldier these days, but I like Clooney's portrayal anyway. I would think that in the explosion at the end Devoe and Kelly would end up with a massive dose of contamination, nothing like that even mentioned. I personally don't recommend buying the DTS DVD, buy the other one for the extras it has because they'll just add to a great movie."
1,UTTER TRASH,This is one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. I just didn't care for any of the characters or plot. It's not even set in America which makes it hard for mass audiences to identify with.
1,one of the worst movies ever!,"This movie has bad acting, an awful plot, and it was just boring. The only redeeming value of this movie was the special effects of the nuclear explosion. The rest of it was a waste the time and money. Skip it!"
3,Details?,"Good God, how difficult is it to hire a technical adviser?I can somewhat understand the producers screwing up on Russian uniforms (placing a Russian Imperial Two Headed Eagle above a Communist red star), but how they manage to mess up on US uniforms is a mystery to me. Just look at the first scene with Clooney. He is being addressed as a Colonel, while wearing the insignia of a Major."
4,highly entertaining eye-candy,"awesome action!....awesome storyline!....and AWESOME actors!....""i'm not scared of the guy who steals 10 nuclear weapons....i'm TERRIFIED of the guy who only steals ONE""...this movie has got to bed on your MUST HAVE list, and as a serious dvd movie collector...it made mine by a mile...i would've given it 5 stars if it had a couple more intense action scenes, and for whoever has seen this, knows what i'm talkin bout, and for those who haven't...a great action flick! and a definite recommendation."
5,THE PEACEMAKER,"This is an excellent product AND an excelletnt movie. It held my attention and suspense until the end. Very good actors as lead roles. I'd like to see more movies like this without sex involved in the story line. Just good action . Please offer MORE of these kinds of movies to us. Even the older movies are great sources of entertainment.Keep up the good work. Thanks,Ed"
4,peacemaker,"I HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET THIS ON BLU RAY,THE WAIT IS OVER, NICOLE LOOKS BEAUTIFULAS ALWAYS.THE MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD ALSO, LOTS OF TERRIFIC ACTION,NOT TO BAD A STORYSOME QUITE BEAUTIFUL SCENERY,GEORGE DOES A GOOD JOB AWAY FROM THE OCEANS(PUN)ALL IN ALL AN ENJOYABLE MOVIE ONE I DON'T MIND WATCHING (MY FIRST REVIEW)CUZ"
4,Pure entertainment,I have always had a lot of affection for this terrorist drama. Pure entertainment with lots of action and some real nasty baddies. The transfer is much better than the DVD and I regard it as one of the better films of its type. Clooney and Kidman make a good pair. The attack on the train reminded me of the Soviet guards entering the train I took years ago from Moscow to Tallinn! Wandering about on the roof in the middle of the night and rifles at the ready! Nasty lot!
4,"superb thriller, excellent acting","This is a good, fun film. The action is fast, the story intricate enough to support multiple viewings, and the chemistry between Kidman and Clooney is believable - indeed, you cannot take your eyes off them. Kidman is a credible White House bureaucrat, rather green but energetic and self confident. Clooney is an ideal military man: he sees a goal and gets there, but he more or less follows orders and hierarchy. Then there is the espionage world, with its practices and networks, this time for the purchase and transport of a nuclear weapon. Somehow, every moment is suspenseful and believable, which these days is food for thought.While it is not particularly original, it is truly wonderful for passing the time and stimulates the imagination to learn about government, if you wish. I have watched this many times with enjoyment.Recommended."
3,good for low expectations,"This movie is your typical action flick. Cocky guy meets smart girl and they continually underestimate eachother's abilities. George does his usual look-down-then-half-look-up and smile thing throughout the movie, and Nicole Kidman does a decent job of looking smart and panicky at the same time. The goal is for the two of them to retrieve recently stolen missles before they fall into terrorists hands. You can pretty much predict everything that's going to happen. So the real question is if you're a fan of either of these two (which I am) or just looking for an easy action movie -- if so, go ahead and buy it. Just keep your expectations low."
2,All action nonsense,"This is great stuff if you're a 15-year-old male. All action, a thousand people die, and the hero and heroine come through with scratches. Car chase. Gore. The usual. Except that the idea of young Ms. Kidman as a top governmental official reporting only to the President is exceptionally ludicrous."
1,Embarrassing Rubbish,"There's not much to say about this feeble Hollywood movie-by-numbers effort. Awful script, weak directing, wooden acting... everyone involved with this piece of utter nonsense should be thoroughly embarrassed. No cliche left unturned, no stale trope left unused. A movie without a single redeeming feature except, of course, that it finally comes to an end. Avoid at all costs unless you want a premature aneurism."
2,Utterly predictible and boring!,"Poor George Clooney - when will he get a break? This makes several movies that have bombed that he stared in. Action is not his best kind of movie, and this was a poor excuse for an action movie all because there was so little truth to it. It must have lacked any military advise during the shooting of the film. For example, there are no night vision goggles, that I know of, that emit red lights from the front of tubes, and to the best of my knowledge,(I spent 11 years in the Army as an officer),no Light Colonel has the kind of power and authority, that Clooney had,especially at the Pentagon! The plot is very thin and Nichole Kidman is such a poor acctress, that it makes any Tom Clancy movie look like a Discovery Channel educational special. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Typical hollywood trash,"Clooney and Kidman are great, but we already knew that. If you were hoping for an intelligent story, you will disappointed as was I. If you want some brainless action that falls just a little short of a James Bond movie, you'll get your money's worth."
3,Lousy finish to a great start,"The first half hour is incredibly well done. It is chilling, intriguing, intense, and in my mind all too plausible.Enter Clooney who has about as much acting talent as one of my clipped toenails. I guess it's better to look good than be good. Is it just me or does he play the same character whether he's a 'Doctor', a fisherman, or an army officer? That little swagger of his is really annoying. He's so unbelievable it's not even worth commenting on.As always watching Nicole is a joy. And SHE can act. But neither her beauty or her talent is enough to support the script. It's a little hard for me to accept someone as young and attractive as she is being in intel master.The story ended up feeling too contrived. What a waste."
2,Silly story,"I saw this when it first came out. Maybe because of all the explosion and shooting, I didn't realize how stupid the story was. No wonder it totally bombed at the box office, even with Clooney and Kidman. This ain't 007 or Die Hard, so don't try to be one. I just hope that the real peacemakers are smarter than this. If you are not ready to simply turn off your brain for two hours, skip it. But if you still want to judge it for yourself, then stop reading.1. The fighting scene on the bridge is ridiculous. Is this how US army works, I mean sending one person down to kill all the enemy, then the rest of the team joins him?2. If you know a nuclear bomb is coming into NY, you don't sit in the office and wait for someone to tell you the flight has already landed.3. You have an FBI team to capture someone, do you send everyone to his room, leaving nobody to watch the exits?This just goes on and on."
3,"Good plot, great action, no chemistry","The Peacemaker is engaging for its modern theme and great action sequences. Definitely makes one think about who's keeping us safe behind the scenes, and what they have to do that we might be shocked to know. Would have enjoyed the dialogue a lot more if there had been any chemistry at all between Clooney and Kidman. Their performances seemed mechanical, like two robots working side by side but having no sense of the other's presence. Despite that flaw, it intrigued us enough to watch it multiple times over a couple of weeks."
4,"The most enjoyable action/thriller since ""Air Force One""","This first film by Dreamworks delivers as an engrossing thriller. While it does wait a bit too long to ""grip"" its audience, the first part of the film still keeps the viewer's attention; and once the action starts, it doesn't stop until the rolling of the end credits. I particularly enjoyed the last thirty minutes--some of the most exciting sequence of events I have ever seen in a film. Clooney and Kidman, while not great, are believable in their roles. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer could have been better (like his work in ""The Rock""), but there are still a few instances of stirring music. With plot elements reminiscent of a 007 movie, ""The Peacemaker"" provides much more excitement than Bond ever could. END"
4,Blueray picture a bit grainy,"Was hoping for more on the BD version of this film but it is still the best picture available for someone who has enjoyed this film in the past. Extras include Stunt footage, George and Nicole's comments on working together in ""From the cutting room floor"" , and the Theatrical trailer. At $10.99 it is a good weekend, popcorn, action thriller, to watch one more time."
4,A Good Friday Night Flick,"The Peacemaker, while not highly original, is definetly one of the better action-thrillers to have come out in recent years. (Along with Die Hard 3 and Speed.)There are some great action sequences in this movie. But the true enjoyment of watching this film comes from watching the chemistry between Clooney and Kidman. And thankfully, the film makers don't make their developing romance a major subplot. All in all, it's a good flick."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I rented this rather than buy it and be disappointed, god I am glad I did. This may sound Chauvinistic of me but Women don't know how to make a War film. I blame the Director for this film's crappyness. The first part of the movie doesn't make sense at all, your left hanging as to what the hell is going on it gives you a vague idea about something with the Russians getting a nuke and then drops off from there, it lacks accuracy about the military to a severe degree, it's littered to the teeth with liberal and feminazi innuendo . And to top it all off it has George Clooney in it. hehehe anyway if you are looking for a good war movie, get a classic, like say...Patton Crimson Tide Air Force one Saving Private Ryan Full Metal Jacket The Dirty Dozen Broken Arrow Gettysburgbut whatever you do don't pay money to see peacemaker...god what a terrible waste of film."
3,very good at first,"this movie starts out well, with the scenes in russia. i really thought this was going to be a good movie, but then the scenes in new york just seemed so fictionus. they just didn't seem believable. don't get me wrong i really like the movie, but the first parts in russia is what really hold the movie together. besides nicole kidman looked really hot, and that's all that matters."
4,Very good and original action movie,"Although not an excellent film, this movie is still a cut above the rest. It is an exciting and original movie that manages to keep you glued to your seat."
4,A Terrorist Attack on New York??? Never Happen...,"Definitely worth a second look. At the time of its release, this first Dreamworks venture got so-so reviews and nasty comments about George Clooney going back to the ER. Seen now, with Nicole Kidman's smart, focused performance and the complex plot - you wonder what those reviewers were thinking. Clooney and Kidman are terrific, the villain unforgettable, the pace relentless and the movie criminally underrated. See it now."
5,a riviting story from the very beginning.,I found Lani to an interesting person. his outlook on life was such that I tried to imagine actually meeting him. it was almost as if he were e real person.
5,A book to read again,"I could not believe how this book captured me! The story seemed simple, but it is very different than other novels written for teens on hard issues such as cancer, eating disorders and death. The characters pull you to go under the facade of perfect small town life to see that every town and every family has its own problems to deal with. I personally wanted more explanation of the medical issues that one of the main characters, Claire, was facing, but she gave enough to make her problems relevant but not overcoming the story's plot. I loved how dispite all the bad things happening there was the constant pull of heaven and angels into the characters lives. It has a great character study of what can happen to people, how they change and can react to eachother. You get to know the characters enough to even relate them to people you might know.Even the end will leave you asking ""What happened to lani garver?"""
2,Turned off by the foul language,"I really enjoyed The Body of Christopher Creed and was looking forward to reading this book by the same author. However, I was immediately turned off by the offensive language and stopped reading. I imagine the story is pretty good but I just couldn't move past the langauge."
5,Get this album!,"Any recording I have ever heard by Tommy Peoples is brilliant, and this is no exception. Different from ""The High Part of the Road"", his previous album, in terms of style and tune selection, this one is yet another classic, which demonstrates his immense musical talent, which is rooted in the rich fiddle tradition of Donegal, in the north-west of Ireland. And he has chosen a guitar-player from nearby Derry to accompany him. Peoples' virtuosity is reflected in the selection of tunes from various wider sources, and he plays them all as if they are his own!"
1,Good Title Lousy Game,I thought this game said it had something to do with vampires. I been fascinated with vampire lore for a long time and love some of the games that follow the old stories. I guess I was looking for more of a Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain or Soul Reaver slant but guess what no dice. This game wasn't by any means hard or challenging. Total waste of what I paid for it in my opinion. The sound tracks were well done but the storyline left a lot to be desired. I am a pretty avid gamer and have a good knowledge of a game that deserves to be played or not and this one is almost no worth renting. There are far better things to do with your time no matter how pitiful your life is trust me. Skip it Move on and get over it before it consumes you completely.
1,So many glowing reviews,"I'm not going to give you many of my opinions on this game because there's no point. There's no shortage of opinion as far as how this game is. If you want to see how absolutely outstanding this game is, simply look at all the reviews below singing praises about this wondrous game. Let's just say, if you like repetition (I.E. Dark Cloud) times 30,000, you'll love this game."
3,A game from a different generation.,"When I first played this game, I hated it. It was nothing like the description, previews or expectations I had. However, it actually turned out to be fairly good. This game is a definate throw-back to the days of arcade fun. There is no story, plot, development or interaction. It's pure and simple hack 'n slash action. I love the game's music, as it gives you a great rock/metal background while you do some slaying. This game strongly reminds me of Diablo, in both it's style and simplicity. Definately a suprise offering. Ignore the previews and purchase only if you like the old days of mindless arcade fun."
1,Think of one of the worst games you have ever played......,"Think of one of the worst games you have ever played,because that game you are thinking of is much better than this game. I am very ashamed to have even purchased this game.My wise words to you are DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
1,Thanks Guys,"EverQuest Meets Diablo...sorta, July 8, 2001Reviewer: A gamer from PennsylvaniaGood Title Lousy Game, December 12, 2001Reviewer: Carl Sager from Bowling Green Ohno character development, November 23, 2001Reviewer: Emerson schreiner (see more about me) from MichiganWish I read the reviews first, October 24, 2001Reviewer: A gamer from Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall IslandsThanks Guys, every single reviewer/gamer hated this game, i guess i should skip it. i am not an rpg fan, but am trying to get into it. the way u guys criticize this game and degrade its value...hmmm......I guess it's a good thing i read the reviews. After all, not these many gamers can be wrong."
5,WOW,"what a ""wow""ing experience! This is my first reaction to this game the first time I played it. Now itz been 2 months, 4dayz, 3hours and 29 seconds and I still couldn't believe why I bought this game. If you really wanna waste your money, time and effort, or in short, if you dont have a life....you definitely should buy this game. I am only giving this game 5 stars coz I bought it and spent my hard earned money on it. And anything I buy is perfect...sayz the joker :)"
1,....,"At first when I decided to play this game, I thought that it would be like Diablo, but was I ever, ever wrong. There was no storyline at all, the bird's eye view was horrible (I kept straining my eyes to see the characters, everything was so dark, except for that strange light that seems to illuminating from Anna, which I don't understand where it came from) and the music was awful. There would be loud pounding music one minute and all of the sudden it's silent for a long time....Strange.... The action was barely there, just run up to the monster and hack. It wasn't even fun after the first 30mins. The graphics isn't even worthy of PSone (maybe supernintendo). Dark Angel is neither an RPG game or is it an adventure game, I don't know what it is...except that it is boring! I wish I could give it zero stars."
1,Horrible,"This is absolutely the worst game ever.there is no storyilne,The graphics are darkand you can barely see whats going on.This is the worse videogame i have ever played."
2,no character development,This game is about a girl named anna. That all we know about her. No character development at all. She’s a girl named anna. Amazeing isn’t it? NO! (...) It might have gotten a 3 star if there had been any hint of a story or in hind of character development. but noooooooooooo.(...) The fighting is OK but nothing worth buying. One cool thing about the game is that the controls are simplier than anything in the entire world.(...)
1,The most pathetic excuse for a game in history!,"Why we aren't allowed to rate 0 stars, I really don't know. This game was definitely the biggest mistake of my gaming career. I bought it several years ago, and spent several days and several nights playing it.... not because it was that good, but because I kept hoping after all the effort I put in, SOMETHING would happen. No suck luck folks... the only saving grace through hours and hours of mindless farming was that the music was fairly entertaining to go along with all the hacking and slashing. I just don't think there are words to adequately illustrate how painful this game was."
2,Average,"If you every played Loaded, you'll recognize this game right away. Good action, but lacking in story. You start the game, and immediately you're fighting, with no history, no explanation, anything.The saving grace of this game is decent graphics, smooth gameplay and the pure joy of slashing through TONS of enemies.If you're looking for pure action with no plot, go for it. If you're looking for depth, try something else, such as Soul Reaver..."
1,"Utter garbage, Metro 3d ...","I don't expect a game to blow me away with story, actors or any other things that goes into a movie. Because it's a game. It's just for fun. With that in mind I try not to rate games too harshly and also because there is usually some reddemming quality that I come away with that is good. But not this one. The game just starts. No intro, nothing to show what is going on or why. Just straught into a Blood omen clone that ... There isn't any story in the whole game. Just move from place to place and kill things. There is no real reason for it. There really isn't anything good in this game. It is years dated and uses nothing of the ps2 power. Metro 3d just put this sorry excuse for a game together and then hoped we the gaming community would waste our money on it. There may not be alot of rpg games on the PS2 but they are coming. Save your cash for the good ones."
1,Don't even bother.,"This is the worst game I have ever seen. There is no plot, no story, horrible graphics. The only good thing that the game has is the name.Don't buy it, it will be a total waste of money."
4,terrific toy,"This princess dollhouse is awesome. It is beautiful, and is my daughter's ""dreamhouse."" It includes all furniture, and is very large. The pieces snap together very tightly, and Ibarely even needed the instructions. It was very common senseand easy to put together. It took me ten minutes to finish.It is much more than I expected, and it is the highlight toyof my daughter's birthday."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,We bought the castle for our five year old granddaughter and we were very diappointed. It was very fragile with various parts like the balcony railing popping off with the slightest movement of the castle. I think Disney should not put their name on such a poor toy which was not cheap.
1,Do not buy this toy!,"I bought this for my daughters two years ago- they loved playing with it, but it fell apart quickly! The quality is VERY poor."
3,"Bad mouse, good pen","I got this pen/mouse combination because my Logitech optical mouse was terrible for any kind of drawing or graphic editing. The pen is great - nice touch, good control, easy to get used to. I didn't think the mouse could be much worse than the Logitech, but I was wrong. It's AWFUL - hard to control and the cursor seems to drift all over the place - which is why I don't mind the little glitch I encountered after installing this. My Win98SE system doesn't recognize it on boot up. So I keep my regular mouse hooked up and when I need to use the pen, I unplug the mouse (USB) and plug in the pen (also USB) and the pen becomes active.The software installed easily and is very useful for changing settings/preferences like what to use the rocker button on the pen for (double clicking, etc...). There's quite a bit of extra software (pen utilities, Photoshop lite, filters) included as well. My 3 star rating is kind of unfair - the pen would get a 4-5, the mouse a 1."
3,I like this product very much BUT....,the radio station nearby seems to interfere with it. The cursor on the screen jiggles so much that I can hardly use it. The Painter software and the pen tool are great. The cordless operation and smooth movement of the mouse are great (there are a few times when the cursor doesn't jiggle). I wish I could use it more.
3,"Not terrible, far from great.","I bought this (like most) JUST for the pen, and just as well, because the mouse really is very annoying. I'm quite happy with how the pen works, and the painting software included is pretty nifty. Not sure if it was worth the money, though. I wonder how much cheaper it would be without the mouse. If it turns out they sell it without the mouse, I'll feel pretty silly. Also, most of the other software it comes with is nonsense... don't even bother installing it..."
3,Mac Users Beware,"Something that you should be aware before buying this product. If you own a Mac, 3 of the applications that are provided will not work (Pen Office, Sensiva and ActiveShare) since they are PC only. Worse yet, if you run OSX, you cannot use any of the ""real"" features of the tablet since the OSX drivers are not yet ready. What that leaves you is mouse emulation mode for the tablet. Personally, that is a lot of missing stuff if you own a Mac."
4,Well worth it for a simple artist,"I've been eyeing the Wacom 4x5 tablets for about four monthes now, ever since I really started to develop a taste for computer art (I'm an artist at heart, but my actual ability with a pen is about nil). I finally got one (for Christmas this year) and was a little worried about how it would work out. Fortunately, it works like a wonder. While it does take some getting used to, and was not exactly how I percieved it would work, it is still a fine piece of equipment. The small size of the tablet is really not a hinderence at all (unless you want to use the included mouse, which is about the same size as the actual drawing area). My only real gripe, though, is the over sensitivity of the pen over the pad, but that is really more of a training issue than anything else, I just need to get used to the slight differences from a normal pen and paper. A great purchase if you need a tablet and don't want to go broke in the process."
2,Great tool for an artist - Bad tool for the average user,"Wacom tablets are the best choice for a pen type interface. It takes a while to adjust, but once adjusted, it works much faster and precise than a mouse. It works great for illustration work and graphic design.If you are not a professional artist/designer, this may not be a good investment of your money. It's not ideal for general usage since it lacks a scroll button like newer mouses. The wacom mouse just isn't usable unless as a backup.Another factor is the pen is small and can easily be lost or misplaced. If so, you are in trouble. (...) No other stores sell replacements, so wacom obviously exploits the situation with inflated prices and poor service."
2,Great tool for an artist - Bad tool for the average user,"Wacom tablets are the best choice for a pen type interface. It takes a while to adjust, but once adjusted, it works much faster and precise than a mouse. It works great for illustration work and graphic design.If you are not a professional artist/designer, this may not be a good investment of your money. It's not ideal for general usage since it lacks a scroll button like newer mouses. The wacom mouse just isn't usable unless as a backup.Another factor is the pen is small and can easily be lost or misplaced. If so, you are in trouble. The replacement for the pen or the mouse costs ($) (($) total) from wacom.com. Shipping is ""free"", but a unscrupulous ($) handling fee is added. No other stores sell replacements, so wacom obviously exploits the situation with inflated prices and poor service."
4,"Nifty hook, looks good.","This takes up very little space, is sturdy, and looks really good. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that on the one we got, the poly coating over the stain wasn't great, it left small splotches. This is a small issue with an otherwise fine product."
5,Sleek,"Excellent coat rack for a hallway or area where you don't want protruding hooks. Looks sleek when hooks are in either position. Holds everything I have hung on it securely, from heavy coats to aprons to clothes on hangers. Nice quality, smooth operation of hooks. This is my second purchase of this coat rack. Both the natural and dark finishes are very nice. The dark looks much more formal."
2,NOT a coat rack!,"The idea and style of this rack is great, but the funcionality of it really stinks if you assume its to be used for caots. The hooks are about 4"" apart and there are 5 of them in a very short rack. There is no way you can put 5 normal sized coats on the rack and have them fit without overcrowding one another. It works well for helmets, dog leashes, goggle, and very light jackets or hoodies. The quality is good, but consider something else if you are using this for coats, jackets or any item of real substance."
3,Picture looks better than actual product,"It works well as a practical hook. The product quality isn't that good though after I received it. The surface has some scratch despite it was wrapped in plastics. The side and back have dark wood stripes. Those are common problems with cheap wood material and wood pieces. I bet that they have good ones too. I didn't bother to return them for an exchange because the seller (The Storage Store) doesn't cover return shipping fee! The shipping fee would be more than 1/2 of the product cost. Instead, I hide the black strip side toward a corner of wall. In summary, it is OK but you need to bet you receive a decent one from the seller's inventory."
5,sleek wall hooks,Replaced existing brass hooks with this umbra 5 hook wall unit. Looks sleek and modern----unique in that the hooks fold up into the wood. Very sturdy---I did not use the wall anchors as felt the screws were sufficient. It is located by my front door and will use it for light-weight hoodies as well as winter jackets.
5,perfect,"saw this item at a friends and it worked so well I wanted one. when I have company it's a coat rack when I don't need it, it's part of the decor."
4,Looks great,"The hook looks amazing. Really easy to install. The only negative thing was that the espresso paint was chipped off around one of the corners, but it was so minimal that I didn't bother returning."
3,Do not follow the directions,"These hooks look very nice...the first one I ordered came scratched out of the box and I returned it for a replacement. It comes with a smart little paper guide used to place the screws into your wall. DO NOT go off this guide. The guide and the holes on the back of the mount did not match up. I did not check this before hand and paid the price. The look really nice though, just measure the holes on the back with your own ruler..."
2,Cutting corners,"It's sad that an overall well designed product can be turned into junk by cheap screws. The coat rack itself is well made with high quality & functional flip hooks but the screws that came with it were so flimsy that both screw heads snapped off while hand screwing them into wood that was already pre-drilled. In fact, the metal is so soft that it wouldn't withstand being drilled so the screws could be removed with a screw extractor. As others have also noted, line up the template with the hanging holes on the back before you use the template as they are off by about 1/2 inch--enough to make it so not only will you not be able to hang it but drilling another hole at the correct distance will be so close that you can weaken the hanging substrate. Irritating that a $30 product is submarined by $0.03 screws & lack of attention to detail."
5,Solid and Well Priced,Not the lightest quick-draws on the market but definitely the best priced. If your just a regular sport climber and don't carry a lot of other gear these can't be beat and they won't burn a hole in your wallet.
4,BD Freewire,"This is a great product for all around climbing. The wire gates make it great for Cold winter days of ice climbing while it is still light enough for a summer rack. The only thing that I don't like is the width of the dog bone, but some people like that."
5,"Good, no, GREAT!","Really well constructed. I don' climb, but this looks cool hanging from my treadmill, which i don't use either. But glad to know i have it, just in case i end up hanging of a rock."
5,SHAME!!!!,"I love this product!!! I use to purchase this product from Boots at less than 6.00 each but unfortunately they stopped selling it. I've ordered online before and although the price, including P&P, was more expensive I decided that it was still worth it. I've recently ordered five more and total cost was 52.19 but today I received a card through the post from Royal Mail saying that they could not deliver my parcel because I need to pay them a Customs Charge of 17.92 (which includes a 8 handling fee)first!!!! Ouch, I now feel gutted because it makes my once 6.00 face powder more than double in price and, I am going to have to search for an alternative, which I know is not going to be easy as I have tried before. So BEWARE, if you are purchasing from the UK it is likely that you are going to be hit for Import Tax. For some unknown reason I did not get charged this when I first ordered, if I had I would not have ordered a second time."
4,"comfortable, long-lasting","I have several pair of an older version of this sock. I have been very happy. They are comfortable, durable, and do what they say. Make sure the wrinkles are out of the under layer, and keep it unbunched at the toe, and you will have a great pair of socks!"
5,"Frederik Doci: soon to be a ""household word ..""","It's my privilege to know one of the songwriters who contributed to this album, so I've had a preview of Frederik Doci's amazing voice .... the question from everyone who hears this album is going to be, ""where has Frederik Doci been all this time?"" Well, he's arrived and I, along with everyone who hears ""Canterina"" will be cheering him on. Oprah, dust off the sofa!"
5,A Pleasant - Sounding Voice,"The voice of Frederik Doci is something!There is no adjective to describe the excellency of it. His pleasant-sounding voice is not only a gift of the Almighty but its behind is a large trained experience of many good music schools which made of him a real star. His intonation in many different languages is another amazing peculiarity. His voice touches indeed, it is unique to me! I think that he is also a man of kind intellect, and worrys enough about his peoples. My congratulation! I hope to see him in Italy. MASRUR IMANI, 01/05/2006 - Trieste, ITALY.---------------------------------------------------------My wife Fulviana Sartini and my son Amir Imani both love his voice.All the best Frederik"
4,Studs look good,"They are beautiful. Service is prompt.They do not come with any kind of certification. As per the seller, they can be certified for some extra $$$."
2,Too much French for me,"The chief problem with this book is that the writer incorporates the French perspective by using citations in French with no translations. I took 2 years of high school French but I'm not that good! This could be overlooked except that, for obvious reasons, I was very interested to hear the perspective of French writing on this lopsided defeat. The experience was like someone telling a long joke and them mumbling the awaited punchline, or someone tearing out the last page of a riveting mystery novel. I simply can't believe key citations weren't translated.Otherwise the study of Henry V was great, and I would like to hear more about him (except since he died young I probably heard it all already.) The treatment of the battle was superficial, but perhaps given the lack of material this could be understood, but more could be done."
3,A good first book on the battle,"A bit dated in approach, but not surprising for a book published in 1964. Very concise: 176 pages including appendices, notes on sources, bibliography, and index--and it reads even quicker than that sounds. Three useful maps, though it would have benefited greatly from one more, for the siege of Harfleur.If you're already a student of the period there's nothing new and different here, and Hibbert explicitly says he won't explain his reasoning when his reconstruction of events differs from other scholars'--this attitude is Not Helpful. But for a non-scholar looking for a first-time, easy-reading study of the battle, this is just the book."
4,Needs Some Translations,"I found this to be an interesting and easy read with one exception. The Author has a number of quotes that appear only in French. While I would love to say that I speak this fine language I do not, so I missed part of the story. I would hope that if this is released as a second edition this would be corrected."
3,Another Sajen success!,These earrings are beautiful.Sajen has turned out to be a great source of jewelry for every day wear.
3,New CD but skipped a little....,New CD but skipped a bit in the middle of the movie. The picture and sound were very clear I must say.
2,How come the people in the film laugh at everything?,"Alan Alda must have been feeling overly sentimental with his examination of friendship between three married couple. Not really worth buying. When I bought it, I was on the advice of a friend and I felt that when I watched it, it was just a few pairs of comfortable old shoes who laughed at everything (I mean everything)!"
5,Never stopped laughing,"I saw this movie when it first came out and I have never laughed so much in my life. I had never been a big Carol Burnett or Alan Alda fan, but the mix of these two, and with Rita Moreno and Jack Weston in my opinion was brillant casting. Bess Armstrong adds to the plot of growing old with friends, and you are left wanting another vacation at the end of this movie. I highly recommend it for the 40 to 50 age group."
3,PAN AND SCAN,"PAN AND SCAN: Need we say more?Why do they butcher a great film like this? Pan and Scan means we don't get all of the picture, but it also means that the close-ups are always too close-up--the face fills the screen. This is the same perverted treatment originally given to ""Chariots of Fire,"" until Warner Brothers finally heard the public outcry and reissued it. I'd certainly be willing to pay more for a film of this quality if UMVD would transfer to DVD all the quality that's there. Of course, this means preserving the original theatrical format."
4,Really Fun,"I liked this film a great deal. three couples meet for vacation during each season of the year. Each one is totally different. Alan Alda is the intellectual that thinks too much. Jack Weston is the cheap dentist that fights with his wife (Rita Moreno) all the time while she keeps saying that she can't help it because ""I'm Italian."" The other couple is kind of sexually adventurous and the wife is a big flirt, especially with Alan Alda.The couples go through all the ups and downs that real friends do, from big fights to real touching moments."
5,Great Movie,"The Four Seasons is a great movie. It is funny, has great music, beautiful locations ranging from the Virgin Islands, to a ski resort and wonderful performances by the entire cast.After watching this movie, you'll start taking stock of your friends and the last few trips you went on with your friends.Great for a Saturday night at home with the family.Little kids, probably won't enjoy this."
5,Exceptionally Enjoyable,"I actually saw this film first in the theatre and have since watched the video many, many times. I still laugh out loud at many scenes. It was great writing, terrific cast, great locations and wonderful direction. I just wish it would be released on DVD."
4,"A little corny & dated, but still great!","I enjoyed this movie back in the 80's and enjoy it almost as much today. A light comedy that pertains to married friendships and what happens when one member of the circle of friends decides to get a divorce thereby threatening the remainder of the group, forcing them to examine their own lives and relationships. Directed by Alan Alda, with very strong performances by Jack Weston and Rita Moreno. Carol Burnett can get on your nerves but also gives an excellent performance."
3,An oldie but a goodie!,"Though this movie is now several years old, I still enjoy watching it. All the leads are perfect in their roles, and the scenery and music are beautiful."
1,Transfer quality,"This is not a review of the film, but a comment (or caution) about the quality of this particular tape. The tape that I received, ""The Four Seasons"", ISBN 0-7662-0222-4, UPC 0-18713-04117-3 by ""GoodTimes Home Video"", is a notably poor transfer. While there is no mention of the recording speed on the jacket, my VCR shows that it is an ""LP"" recording. The picture quality reflects this and suggests that the tape may have been simply copied from a ""standard play"" VCR tape (at the slower speed as a cost savings measure). If you can locate this film from a source other than ""GoodTimes"", even at a higher price, you may find better value. (6/27/00)"
4,great service,"excellent condition, fast service. not my favorite Cercas novel but a good entry novel for those who are not familiar with this excellent Spanish novelist."
4,Chilling but entertaining......,I have to say that I was drawn to this book after reading Most Likely to Die and I wasn't disappointed.The only question I have is this.........how is it that Cassie's fiancee Alec is a podiatrist but later in the book Cassie tells her mother that Alec can't join them for dinner because he is giving a collagen injection to a mother of the bride to be?????? That glaring error aside the book is excellent and the mystery surrounding the murders keeps you guessing until the killer is finally revealed.
1,Just awful.,"I haven't even got past the first 10 pages and I can't believe this is published. Can't stand the stereotypes and typical crap of .... wants a baby, denigrades another friend for not wanting one. Chestnut flowing hair and lithesome body. Are you kidding me? I'm not finishing this, it was given to me. I'm burning it on the fire instead."
1,This book made me want to SCREAM.,"Without seeing any reviews of this book on this site, I knew that most of the female reviewers would have been glued to this novel from page one. There are guys like myself out here that do enjoy reading romance and ""damsels in distress"" novels and authors and publishers should be aware of this. However, in regards to this book this seems to have been written solely for women to read. My only wish is that the characters, along with the book, fall into the gapping maw of an erupting volcano."
2,Never Again!,"The best thing I can say about this book is that it wasn't as awful as ""The Final Victim"".I've read several books by this author. The books are all at least 100 pages too long & always go into detail on piddley stuff but the important things we're left to figure out. Ex.: How long did Garth's relationship with Tildy go on after he met Brynn? What about after he & Brynn were living together? What a jerk! What exactly happened in Boston in June that made Fiona think there was still something going on?What happened with Cassie since that wasn't much more than a footnote?Fiona was a horrid creature who didn't deserve to be a mother. And Tildy, while she didn't deserve what happened to her, was worthless too.And yet again, another Corsi Staub book with an inane ending and the murderer someone we barely knew, or cared, anything about.I will not read another book by this author!"
5,It will change the way you think. It's brilliant.,"This book is amazing. I won't bore you with a list of superlatives (which would take up this entire review if I did) but I will simply say that Russ's insights into the innumerable subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which women's art is censored or devalued are enraging and empowering, and are expressed with such wit and charm that you could it three times in one day and laugh out loud each time -- I know I did. Read it. Give it to your friends. It will change the way you think."
1,"She won't take ""yes"" for an answer","With the possible exception of the western, sci-fi has historically been about the most markedly gendered genre of fiction. Up until the 1970s, their were hardly any women writing in the field at all (Judith Merrill and Leigh Brackett being rare exceptions). The readership was likewise almost exclusively male. So that's what Joanna Russ was up against when she tried to break into the field in the 1970s. So, what kind of welcome did she get from the boys? Well, in short order the evil sexist curs of sci-fi community had bestowed upon Joanna Russ its two highest honors, the Nebula Award and the Hugo Award.Understandably outraged at this shabby treatment, Russ poured her anger into this prolonged whine of a book, this manual of grievance, this feminist masterpiece."
4,Advice from the trenches,"Radioactive Leadership gives advice grounded in reality from someone who has served in the trenches of management. One of the most interesting points in the book is the idea that the leaders in an organization are not always the ones who bear the title of ""manager."" This book provides practical, easy-to-understand tips for those who haven't been formally trained in management yet have assumed management responsibilities.If you're a manager looking to develop those on your staff who are natural leaders, or if you're seeking to advance up the management ranks yourself, you'll find ""Radioactive Leadership"" very useful."
5,My favorite travel guide ever,"This is a beautiful book. From the high quality paper to the best ever ratio of photos to text (fewer photos than most Eyewitness Guides, but far more than, for example, Fodor's or Frommer's or Lonely Planet, etc.), this is a great publication. The text is well-written and gives a wonderful oversight of everything from history to religion to food to culture to architecture. The book is obviously a bit out of date, but so complete you just want to read it over and over to learn about these two captivating countries. The useful information sections are truly useful, covering everything from telecommunications to tips for women and gay travelers. I feel like I know these countries already."
1,broken product,I purchased this tote and when I received it in the mail the lid had completely detatched from the rest. and nothing was broken... it was missing part of the hinge that keeps he kid attatched. I was extremely disappointed to find that they had sent me a product that was not put together properly.
3,Cute but small,"This is a little tin tote good for keeping small items in, nothing bigger than pens and pencils. The dimensions listed are exterior dimensions with the handle fully extended, and not the holding space of the box itself, so it sounds bigger than it really is.It is also not very sturdy. The front latch fell off as soon as I opened the box it came in, and I had to re-attach it with the little pin holding it in place.Note that it is definitely not big enough to serve as a lunch box."
4,Easy enough,Was pretty much what you signed on for. Easy to assemble bed frame. Haven't had any problems with it yet. Seems stable and doesn't make any noise!
5,Nice and firm,"This replaced one with four legs - the difference is amazing!Much firmer with far less movement vibration, and high enoughfor underbed storage boxes!"
1,not worth the price,"First of all the item arrives in a box that has to be torn apart in order to remove the frame. Therefore if you are unhappy with your purchase you will not be able to return it in the box it arrived in. The center support bar is too short, perhaps it would fit a full size mattress but on the diagram it is shown to be placed at a diagonal to fit for a full size mattress. Also the center support is to be attached by brackets, the brackets were not included in the packaging. So the center support bar is useless and will be going to the landfill. I hate having to do that. You are much better going on Craig's list."
4,"Yep, it's a bed frame!","I received this relatively quick and in good shape. The instructions had ripped up a bit during the shipment and were a little hard to read but not too bad. I had never put together a bed frame before so it took me a couple trial and errors attaching the center support beam but I finally got it. Took me about 45 minutes to piece together and then put my boxspring and mattress on by myself. Sturdy, doesn't squeak, looks exactly like the picture and is a good height. Pretty good deal with the free shipping."
2,Incorrect Cross-bar,"Although this is a nice heavy duty frame, the cross-bar that came with it is not meant for a queen size frame. It looks like it might be for a full size frame. I emailed the seller but have had no response. SO..we are not using the new frame until I can get a new cross-bar."
3,King Bed Frame,"The order was placed, we received a bed frame in a very short time. Excited to have a new bed frame we went to put it together when we discovered it was the wrong size. Contacted Bunk Bed Frames and they advised to hold onto it until they sent UPS to pick it up, they would send the correct size immediately. I still have the incorrect bed frame and am still waiting to have it picked up. The service through Amazon has been just absolutely wonderful, just need to get the wrong item returned. Thanks for your service."
4,Good interaction with Latin / Western Theology,"Good interaction with Latin / Western Theology including that of Protestants. Very well organized, easy to read, and saturated with the Fathers."
3,NOTHING like the book,"In the book, the protagonist- Allie Fox- was a sadistic, egotistical narcissist. None of that came thru in the movie. Lacking many of the nuances & adding things that Allie never would have e.g. air conditioning. Allie would have soon cut of his other finger.. which, was another thing missing (er...or not missing) was Allie's stub of a finger. It had alot of meaning and power in the book.So.. you *might* like this if you've never read the book- but, I don't advise watching if you've read it."
4,memorable,"Don't ask me why, but I remember one thing in particular about this film, the fading of the shirt Ford wears virtually every day, a fading only prolonged, repeated exposure to the sun can produced. Usually, when someone does a detail like that right (something a Steven Spielberg most assuredly does not; think of Harrison Ford running away from the natives in one of the first scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark, a film that gets worse with every viewing, and the clouds of dust coming off his jacket ... Steven: we got it; less would have been more) the rest of the film always follows, and this one does. I remember that too."
5,An Underappreciated Masterpiece,"I'm a huge fan of both the novel and the film. Yes, the novel goes into more depth and the lead character, played by Harrison Ford on his best performance, is even more of a lunatic in it. This is a gorgeous film that has no easy answers and no cookie cutter characters. I think most of us agree with most of Allie Fox's sentiments about American society, but he takes himslef and his family to the furthest extremes of his obsessions. The minimal score provides a wonderful atmosphere and the entire cast is excellent, especially the late River Phoenix.If you are looking for an easy film with little challenges for the viewer, watch Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones. If you want to see him in an edgy, risky and brave role, try The Mosquito Coast."
1,Boring with no direction,This is my pick as the all time worst movie I have seen. I think this is the only time I've ever given a movie 1 star too. It was boring and just seemed plain dumb. It goes on and on and you are left wondering how can this guy be this stupid. And his wife just sits there and you have no idea what's going on with her. This movie is a serious waste of time.
4,Cool,This is probably one of Harrison Fords least popular movies but I consider it one of his best. A great story in a amazing setting. Good casting and well acted. Very believable and entertaining. It is one of those hidden gems of a movie.
2,Okay,"There is a lot good in this film, but a lot that's bad. It's clumsily constructed, but it's original, and it's refreshing to see a major star play a jerk. Most stars want to play perfect people. I know someone who read the book, and thought the movie sucked by comparison. I didn't read the book, and thought the movie so-so. Even though there is a lot wrong with the movie, it IS substantive, and there are fewer such movies from major studios with major stars than ever. So, it's rather an oasis in the desert of contemporary cinematic fair. It's not that great an oasis, but considering that all around it is desert, that ups the value of the film quite a bit."
2,Not a Great Movie,"This movie stars Harrison Ford, so it has to be a good movie, right? Wrong. The plot is very weak. The characters are not very believable or likeable. This one is not on the level as his Indiana Jones movies. We watched this one only once."
3,Good enough until a Blu-ray comes along.,"Love this movie and its story. This 2008 DVD is a repackage of the 1999 disc, but it's not all that bad. The anamorphic transfer is entirely watchable even by today's standards; there's some not-too-distracting MPEG noise and the film looks aged. Colors are vibrant. A pefectly acceptable placeholder in your library until a Blu-ray hits with a pristine transfer. I'm not holding my breath but I'll be in the store when one streets."
4,forgotten ...,"This is a movie forgotten somewhere in Ford's and director Weir's filmography. It's a shame, because it is compelling, well written. Ford's character completely looses his mind halfway into the history, putting his own family in danger for the sake of his ""ideals"". It's a good movie, based on a good book."
1,Good example of how even a great actor can't make every good,Watched this movie some time ago and now I have an appreciation as to what a bad movie really is. Harrison Ford has shown that he really has talent and dedication halfway through the production of this movie he had to know how embarrassing this movie would be for his career all in all it is a good contrast point of bad movies.
2,"Great book if you like insanity, fair movie.","Right now i have this ranked as HF's worst movie. Yes it is even worst than 6 days and 7 nights. I do preserve the 1 star rating for the totally bad movies, but HF is in it, hence 2 star here."
2,missing links--obviously based on a book,"This movie was nowhere near as good as the book. I'm surprised that anyone who read the book would think the movie's better. The movie's so unfulfilling because so much of the progression between events is left out. Instead the movie jumps from image to image in many places, as if a 5 second scene here and a 10 second scene there are enough to show how the family adapted to the environment--and, more importantly, adapted the environment to them. Of course, this is an insight that one could not have without reading the book and seeing how much was left out. There is a right way and a wrong way to adapt a book to the silver screen. This was the wrong way. If you insist on watching it, try reading the book first."
1,This movie blows,"Three of us are contributing to this review. I'm sad to say we paid full price for this movie when it first came out at the theatre. When the movie was over everyone stood up and said, ""What"" ""is that it"" People shaking their heads and complaining and wanting their money back. Have never seen that happen before. This is by far the worst movie any of us have ever seen. We use this movie as a long running joke, comparing all other bad movies to it and saying, well it wasn't as bad a Mosquito Coast. Save your money and buy a differnt movie. It would have to be better. Unless your buying for someone you don't like: then this would be a good gift."
2,Warning!! Not a happy ending!,"This is one of those thoughtful, well acted movies with a deeply unsatisfying conclusion. If you like such things, have at it. If you like happy endings, avoid it."
3,Not what I had hoped for!,"Harrison Ford, in my opinion, was at his worst in this movie! It was ok, but he acted as someone with a mental problem. Others might enjoy this. it was just not the kind of movie, that he fit in very well, in my opinion."
1,It started out ok...,"I bought this cam from Wal-Mart, brought it home, installed it, and everything was fine. A few weeks later, I was trying to get it online for my family to watch me on cam, and the output was just a green screen. At first I thought it was te free program I was using for the online web community. But I was checking out the cam and the batteries were corroded!! They were brand new batteries too! So it wasn't the batteries fault. I paid way too much for this camera. I bought it when they were $... and I took it back to Wal-Mart and only got $... of my money back because Creative had limited refund requirements. Overall a bad buy. I will never buy from this company again!!"
2,"Pretty, but patronising.","If what you like about adventure games is pretty scenery, then by all means buy this game. If you actually like using your brain, look elsewhere.I was totally offended that Lotus Spring was advertised as ""geared towards women,"" and contained no real puzzles. Like, women don't like to do puzzles? Or is it just that we aren't smart enough to solve real puzzles? I also found it odd that you were playing a male character. What kind of message is that?This game might be amusing to girls under the age of nine, and it might be a good parent-child activity, but it has nothing to recommend it to an adult on her own."
3,Beautiful graphics,"The graphics are pretty, but the animations are boring and cheesy. The cursor looks like a fisher price person to me. I was totally lost in the garden of perfect brightness, the place was like a maze and I found myself constantly coming back to the same places over and over again. I like the way the scenery begins to darken with approaching night as you get further in the game, but all together while I was playing this, I found myself thinking, what exactly am I supposed to be doing in this game? Like I said before, the scenery is great, and I don't know much about China, but I would say they did a good job reproducing it. It was also a nice history lesson. Maybe more of a plot and less aimless wandering and I would have liked it more."
4,"Not tough, but pretty","While fans of action games may be bored by Lotus Spring, I found it to be beautiful and engaging. The puzzles were fairly easy, but the maze-like layout of the garden added some interest, and it was full of beautiful images and sounds. The in-depth stories behind many of the objects in the garden offered a fascinating glimpse into Chinese legends and customs. If you like a lot of explosions, this isn't for you, but I found it to be quite enjoyable."
2,"Lovely to look at, but somewhat disappointing as a game","Unfortunately, this game really did not meet my expectations. It was gorgeous to look at (and I *do* appreciate the scenery, as I'm very much interested in Chinese culture), but it felt more like one long lesson rather than like a game at all, let alone one of of Myst caliber. In fact I never even finished the game -- just didn't find it challenging enough.I'm not sure what exactly makes this game ""women-gamer oriented"" other than it's a love story. I appreciate the publishers' intent to create female-aimed games and would be happy to support future efforts of theirs... they just need be little more than a historical romance novel."
1,save your money,"Lotus Spring has beautiful graphics. The End. The story is vague. Moving through the game is frustrating. The icon selector is ""just tooooo cute for words"" as well as annoying. If you have played even one other computer game, Lotus Spring will wean you from ever playing another."
2,Plodding and static!,"One of the single most boring games I have ever run across -- couldn't hold my attention for half an hour. Gameplay consists of moving around an almost silent, unoccupied, uninteresting Celestial Palace, making tea pour and flowers bloom. Characters are static, story is dull, puzzles are monotonous. For the faint of heart and the extremely patient only."
1,If you have a Mac--don't buy Legend of Lotus Spring,"In order to open this game a Mac user has to disable QuickTime and the instructions for doing so are inconsistant and confusing. In my case once I did this and then installed the game's version of QuickTime-my computer failed and I had to clean sweep my computer and then try to restore all my files. Now, I suspect any game that has to disable software in order to play it. P.S. Amazon kindly replaced the CD once and neither the original or the replacement would play. I don't know about PC use but for a Mac. I would avoid this game at all costs. P.S. The instructions are not in the manual that comes with the CD. I had to E-mail Dreamcatcher Games and that's when the confusion began. Avoid this game and for me. I avoid anything by Dreamcatcher games."
2,Gathering dust on a shelf,"I sometimes like adventure games, but this one has been hard to get into. I bought it, and have started playing it several times, only to put it down. Here at the beginning of the game, at least, I do not get a strong enough sense of plot and enough gratification to want to continue.""Lotus Spring"" was aimed at women, as an alternative to regular PC games. I am their target market -- a woman interested in games, but not compelled by the majority of games out there, which are clearly aimed at young men. That is still a great idea, but this product misses the mark.Pretty graphics and music, but not enough fun."
1,Despicable.,"A dull game that consists mainly of meandering. Puzzles are simplistic, yet unintuitive. Rewards consist of cut scenes featuring a courtship. The game is strongly targeted to women. To the extent that women are maudlin simpletons, it should appeal to them. For my part, I found it a bit insulting."
1,A Stinky Flower,"Game produced to appeal to a specific audience - namely teenage girls with nothing better to do with their time. That is fine, and may be benificial as the monotany may force them outside, away from their monitors.Repetitious and tedious. Buy if watching grass grow adds excitement to your life."
4,Well thought out analysis of Textual Crisicsm,After reading both volumes I and II i have a much better understanding of how we have arived at all of the current translations. In these volumes you will find very well documented material that supports the Majority Text as opposed to the Nestle Arend or UBS Manuscripts. Also for those of use who truly believe that the bible is the inspired word of God you will find in volume II excelent illustrations of how the various translations treat the Cardinal tenents of the christian faith. If you are serious about learning Gods word you nead to read this book before you select a translation of the Holy Bible to read from. The only reason that i didn't give the books a 5 star review was because some of the material gets very technical and may not be readily absorbable by all readers. However it is quite worth going through the material despite its highly technical approach.
1,Warning; Live CD,"I was SO looking forward to hearing the Art of Noise in SACD Surround. I did NOT know this was a live concert CD. I've never seen them live, and perhaps if I had, this might have been a nice reminder. But as a listener, the mix is bass-heavy, the crowd noise irritating, and the banter of the 'story of our hero, Claude Debussy' is pointless. I never want to hear this disc again."
4,Very Nice,"I like the action in this movie, were the woman is in chage and could listen to good reasoning."
2,only okay,"This book is too advanced for a beginner and too simple for anyone who is ready for its content. Latvian has a complex grammatical structure that is completely foreign to English speakers and this book makes that structure confusing. Furthermore, there aren't a lot of instantly accessible phrases that beginners would need to know in order to survive. The progression is too quick and can cause frustration.The thing the book is good at is providing cultural information so that a newcomer gets a sense of the place and the people. The book follows a story of Latvian Australians coming to visit relatives and seeing the sights of Latvia and can, from this perspective, provide insight for those who don't know a lot about Latvia.The problem is that there are precious few materials out there to assist one to learn Latvian. If Colloquial Latvian is all you can find, then it is better than nothing. But do not place high hopes on it helping you to conquer Latvian becuase it simply won't."
3,"Well, at least it's available...","Not a lot of ways to learn Latvian and many are out of print or in print but only in some godforsaken place. I currently live in Latvia and can tell you that although this book is not BAD! it is also not good. It drops you into very advanced grammatical concepts very early on (I think perfect tense is covered in chapter 2). There isn't a logical progression of vocabulary or concepts (wouldn't it be better to know past or present tense before perfect?). There is good inclusion of cultural information -- actual maps of riga to learn directional vocabulary, newspaper ads, excerpts from Raina or dainas. I guess when it comes down to it I wonder why I'm learning Latvian from a Brit/Aussie? I can tell you that the local University language immersion programs use the Dialogs series almost exclusively. But why can't someone get Trevor Fennel in print again? That would be the answer -- instead I have to visit the library to review his presentation of grammatical concepts."
2,Difficult,"I do recommend the ""Teach Yourself""-book instead. I bought this book without a CD.This book covers important areas. For me, there's too little excercises and you continue too fast into the next area too soon.The ""Teach Yourself""-book contained the CD."
1,Terrible Book and accompanying CD,"The book does a terrible job introducing the beginner to Latvian. It throws words at you in the first chapter like accusative and nominative and genitive and dative, like I am supposed to know what it is talking about. The accompanying CD rushes through the dialogues and does not explain why sounds are not pronounced in some words but are in others. It is very confusing. The book and CD were about a $60.00 investment and I feel like I threw my money away."
5,DIETER'S DELIGHT*****,"What a great surprise! Something so delicious and so low in calories! Each cake (or as I would say cracker) was16 calories. An average serving of 3 cakes only 48 calories - NO CHOLESTEROL, NO FAT AND SUGAR FREE! Thesecakes were textured, chewy, tasted so good and were a great size. I tried the multigrain first. Outstanding!You can munch on these whenever you have a food craving. So filling! No binging! Better than the 100 calorie cheese puff bags that only leave you hungry and wanting more. I ate a whole bunch of these cakes and still losta few pounds. I have now ordered all the different flavors, so when the dieters find these, there will be a run to buy and I wanted some before they were on backorder! Enjoy these - you will not be disappointed!sustre9"
2,Stapler Jams frequently.,Doesn't work for me. Constant staple jams on only a couple of sheets of paper. I'm looking for a better quality desktop stapler...
1,Paper Weight,"Bought this stapler and it worked fine for the first month when I used it but whenever my wife used it, well, I can't say it jammed but it just wouldn't work. It didn't get staples stuck or anything but would just miss them or something and then the part that holds the staples would get stuck inside the upper part. I would then have to get a tool (leatherman or something) and get it unstuck. I still wasn't too unhappy with it until it has started doing the same thing with me almost every time. I am replacing it with a better brand since many of the swinglines seem to have issues."
2,Toy,"I should have read more carefully. This is almost a little toy. Don't plan on sta[ling more than about 10 pages. I tried stapling the plastic case it came in. First, couldn't get enough leverage to go through. Finally got it but I can see this little baby jamming easily. Might be handy hanging from your belt if you're stapling a few pages together at various places as you walk around. For the rest of the real world, get something a little more heavy duty."
5,REALLY GOOD,GRACIAS POR LEE MI REVIEWESPERO QUE NO LO PIENSES DOS VECES ESTE PRODUCTO ES MARAVILLOSOAPARTE DEL BUEN PRECIO ES TODO LO QUE TODO TRABAJADOR QUIERE..BUENO BONITO Y BARATO PARA LA CALIDAD Y EL NOMBRE..COMPRALONO TE AREPENTIRAS..OK[[ASIN:B00008WFT3 DeWalt DC759KA Heavy-Duty 18-Volt Ni-Cad 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit]]
1,never made it out of the box,"I was going to be one of those folks who just ordered a new set rather than pay the ridiculous price of replacing the batteries. But the set I ordered, which clearly shows the item with the large sized batteries, came with the much smaller batteries that are about 1/2 as tall. So back it went without ever taking it out of the box. They apparently get away with that enough to keep doing it, even though in my case it was a double shipping cost to them with no revenue.I'll also mention that around the same time I found out through a local mechanic who stocks Interstate batteries that you can send in these tool batteries and Interstate will rebuild them--not just Dewalt, any such battery that's not in a sealed case. Here they cost me $45 each plus sales tax. Not cheap but better than most anything else I've found. And if I do it through my mechanic who gets regular visits from the Interstate truck, there's no shipping"
1,"Good Drill, But Weak Chuck","I'm usually a big DeWalt fan, but lately they've disappointed. I bought this drill 6 months ago when my 7 year old Makita 12V died. I loved the power of the new 18V and the 1/2"" chuck is awesome, but for no reason the chuck stripped out on me last week while drilling with a 1"" spade bit. I'm basically just a Harry Homeowner user, so it definitly didn't get abused. So, I'm not going with Dewalt again for my next drill. I just bought a Milwaukie 14.4V 1/2"" chuck with hammer feature. Milwaukie looks to be a winner so far."
2,Ha! A $200 joke... And its not funny either.,"Ha! A $200 joke... And its not funny either.That about sums this drill up. It started out great, but the chuck eventually warped, and the battery stopped holding a charge after several months of light, household use. How much does a new battery cost? About $120.I'd rather bust out the corded drill and extension cord..."
2,Dewalt = Black and Decker in a yellow dress,"B&D bought Dewalt to tap into the 'professional' image market. The Chinese factories that make Dewalt are making Black and Decker side by side. Now that Dewalt has moved into big box retailers, they are focused on hitting the price points Big Box wants. Another annoying feature of Dewalt is that it does not provide torque ratings for its drills so that you can compare them to other brands. You cannot compare a particular model Dewalt against Milwaukee, Makita, Hitachi, etc. until you actually use it. Fortunately, most retailers give you 30 days for evaluation. BTW, the DC759KA is the little brother to the more powerful DC720KA. As Dewalt finally follows the industry into Lithium Ion batteries, expect prices to drop for this older NiCD technology."
4,Great drill,"I bought this for my son as a gift but I have one just like it. He used mine once and said he had to have it. Like me he had gone thru drills from other manufactures trying to save a few bucks. Lots of power and torque.The variable speed is sweet, makes it's easy to start screws. The only items I didn't like was the two speed switch is not marked as to Slow-fast (Magic marker cured that) and the markings for the forward and reverse switch are hard to see. This is only an irritant if you use it once a month or so, like me. Also the chuck jaws must be retightend if you use reverse a lot backing drill bits in and out. Again a minor irritent because it only takes a second to close the chuck jaws again. I've seen this in other drills that are hand tightend Vs use of a key."
3,Little rough,"Bought it refurbased, and it was rather rough around the edges. All in all the drill does preform well. !"
1,Dewalt customer service SUCKS,Bought a new impact from Dewalt in mid Nov. A week later while charging my battery the charger and battery melted. I contacted Dewalt twice and have never heard back. Looks like I should have bought a impact from Makita instead.
4,Plenty of torque,This is a good tool. I bought one for each of my sons and they are happy with it. The only downside is the small battery so you have to recharge or change batteries more often.
1,Broke after five minutes of use...,"I have purchased numerous tools over the years. From Harbor Freight $5 specials to $2000 cabinet table saws, but I have never had a tool under perform like this DeWalt drill. Shortly after purchasing the drill I used it for a minute or two drilling some holes in some wood. I put it up and pulled it off the shelf today to drill some holes with a forstner bit into maple. I drilled two holes and the drill broke. The clutch broke inside the drill and it is totally incapcitated.Now I would expect this from my $40 Hitachi special, or maybe a K-Mart special $9.99 drill, but from a $200 DeWalt 18 volt?"
1,Worse Drill in History,"I have had many cordless drills in my Construction business and this is the worse drill I have ever used. The setting are a joke! With this drill I cannot drill a simple hole with a twist bit. I can torque it up to it's highest torque and hold it with my hand. I have a six year old DeWalt 12 vote that works circles around this hunk of junk. To bad they sold out to Black and Decker, they have brought DeWalt down to their level. Very sad."
3,DeWalt DC759KA Heavy-Duty 18-Volt Ni-Cad 1/2-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit,SMALL AND LIGHT WITH ONE DRAW BACK THE DIRECTION BUTTON TOO SHORT TO CHANGE DIRECTION WITH OR WITHOUT GLOVES.
2,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! Drill!,I learned how far down the quality ladder DeWalt has slipped. I always insisted on DeWalt. No longer the case. Dumbed down to a yellow Black n Decker home owner special. Now the color matches the Cheeziness!!!
1,Not the same old Dewalt quality,I needed and extra screwgun recently so picked this one up for $99 from AmazonConsChuck wobbleMotor smokes when drilling (eek!)Batteries overheat really fast (less than 30 seconds)Little power for a drill.ProsIf all you need is a cordless powered screw driver this is mediocre.In Summary.Disappointed with this purchase - I will stick to my older XRP 18v Cordless Dewalt for drilling and use this drill specifically for light screwing.
5,Dewalt vindicated!,"I have read the reviews on this drill and, now that I use one myself, I am ready to give my opinion. Many wrote that the chuck wobbled and I hesitated to buy it for this reason. I use this drill constantly in a retail store and have had ""zero"" problems with the chuck in that area. It runs true to center and stays tight. The chuck works strange in that it tightens well only when the trigger is not engaged at all. The brake holds the chuck at rest and, only then, will allow the bit or driver to grip snugly. Works well! Although Dewalt may have fixed the issue because most of the negative reviews are two to five years old. The batteries hold a charge well also. I have only charged them once in about two months time using the drill for about ten minutes or so at a time. This is a company drill and now I am going to get another one for my home use. Great product and I hope this review helps any of you out there who are undecided to make a wise choice."
5,"DeWalt HD 1/2 "" cordless 18 volt drill / driver",Have had many cordless drills and this one is by far the most powerful and the batteries seem to last longer than all the other drills used in the past
3,its ok,if you plan to use this for construction or heavy use look elsewhere...i have been a dewalt customer for years and to get this to replace my 11 yr old 18v was kinda dissapointing as its cheaper and the chuck does wobble on mine as well but not very bad now it is still a nice drill i picked it up for 99 but not sure its worth more since it has its flaws this one will be given to the wife for household chores and i will continue my search for a better one im sure it will do fine with the occasional household jobs
5,"great drill, video instructions available","Love this drill. We made a video manual for similar DeWalt 720KA drill on HandBookLive.com (under Tools). The drill is very simple to use, but if you are more visual and don't want to to read instructions - this is a quick way to see what it does, and how to use it. In my opinion the video is more useful for woman like me, who want to feel more comfortable using a drill for the first time (I remember using a screwdriver forever because I just wasn't so sure what kind of damage I can do with an electric tool).We bought it when we decided to build a loft and didn't want to use our cheap drill for such a big project. We use it all the time for quick fixes around the house. This drill is light and feels great in the hand. The speed control is very good too. And I never used to bother with speed controls on my drill before.Have fun with it!"
5,Expect nothing else from dewalt,"I am a smaller female and had been planning on buying the 12V because it was lighter, BUT...I bought this as the 'Deal of the Day' which made it cheaper than the 12V. I have zero complaints, and don't find it to be too heavy at all, even on more in depth projects."
2,Quality Control?,It seems that quality control is on the same par as big foot in the dewalt camp. I purchased my drill at Home Depot and the first thing I noticed was excessive chuck runout. I exchanged it today for another and the newer drill has less runout but its still there. I guess that's what 99 dollars buys. As soon as the new rigid tools arrive I am making a purchase. Lifetime batteries what a concept.
2,ALL BARK AND NO bite...,"Drill endurance is terrible. 5 year old Panasonic 15.6 volt and 3 year old Ryobi 18 volt beat it up everyday. Protocol is 3 battery swaps in an 8 hour work day. It's only 6 months old. Bottom line, A RYOBI OUT-PERFORMS IT! My co-worker calls it a yellow Ryobi and laughs at me everytime it dies in action.I will continue to use it because it cost 199 dollars and I cannot afford to try my luck with something else right now. Service center was dissapointing as there is no recourse for a sub par product. You live, you learn."
3,Check you drill for runout,"Having done some research, I decided to get this drill - despite the fact that many have experienced chuck wobble or runout with some of these. When I got the drill home and put a bit in it, I was quickly disappointed. The wobble was very very noticeable while running the drill slowly. This is *unacceptable* for a $200 drill. I am done with dewalt - I don't understand why they let these drills out the door. I am returning the drill and getting the Makita comparable."
1,Keyless Chuck,"The Keyless Chuck is total garbage, it keeps falling out, and wont tighten up at all. i actually feel it would be easyer just to buy a new chuck for this gun, rather then send it back.and for $200.00 i shouldnt have too."
3,Joey's Spider,"My book ""Spider Boy"" was a pretty good book.It was funny and exciting.It was about a boy and his spider.I have read the book 2 times.I think if you read it you would love it. It was the the best book I have ever read."
3,Spider Boy,"In the book called Spider Boy,a boy was moved to another town.There, he got to settle down and he went to a new school.Their the first day of sixth grade started of great but farther in the day,he found himself in trouble with a boy bigger,stronger but dumber than him.He had a problem with him because he loved spiders.The boy soon wanted school to end but he knew that he had to put up with more school years.Eventualy he takes care of the bully and kept on loving spiders.Thats all im going to tell you.you have to read the book.Only if your a huge spider lover.Me I hate spiders but i like this book."
2,Lackluster,"This book is terrible. The exposition is rather poor and shallow. Too focused on Java and not JavaScript/Ajax. The authors knowledge of JavaScript come across as being peripheral and unfocused. This book is simply riding the Ajax craze wave and if you're a self-respecting programmer, you'll be returning this book in no time. Terribly disappointed. There are two other books on Ajax/JavaScript that do a much, much better job at explaining the technology and its uses than this primer; I'd give the names, but don't want to cross-advertise."
2,Not a good choice,"What you will NOT find in this book: XMLHttpRequest disection, best practices, POST examples (it says that GET is the one you will use, the POST is there just in case you need it), obviously Web Services are not covered either, actually no XML to XML of any kind.Examples are quite repetitive (obvious if you don't use Web Services or POST methods) and some of them require a JAVA backend to run.Nevertheless you WILL find almost half the book dedicated to javascript debug/documentation tools and techniques... BUT the examples in that sections are ""foo-bar"" examples, none of them related to AJAX in any way.Bad bad choice for me. But i ordered together with DOM Scripting (Jeremy Keith) and Bulletproof Web Design (Dan Cederholm) and those two books are so good that made me forget about this one really soon."
5,"moving, truthful and insightful truly shows God's love","What a wonderful book to read for anyone who has lived with mental illness themself or was a member of a family with a parent that suffered from mental illness. It shows how one woman, having grown up in a two-parent household, had an absolutley horrific childhood. Her mother locked her in a closet for hours on end and continually verbally abused her as well. As she reaches adulthood, knowing how to relate to others is tough and causes much anxiety and pain. Through much error and wrong choices during her young adult years, she meets a man who tries to tell her about the love Jesus has for her. Not really understanding what it is all about, Stormie continues down the wrong path until one day she truly opens her heart up to God! Through reading this book, one is able to gain knowledge about people with mental illness as well as learn how to experience the love and forgiveness of God."
5,I couldnt put this book down! Best book I've read in a LONG time.,"I had read a couple of her other books, Power of a Praying Wife and of a Praying Parent. I bought my daughter the Power of a Praying Teen. My daughter and I talked about Stormie like a friend. I wanted to get to know her better. I couldn't put the book down. I read every second I could. It is so wonderfully written."
3,Very weak nail magazine,"I'm using this nailer for a couple of years now. Very powerful and easy to use nailer. However, there are some disappointment. First the nail magazine is too weak(thin aluminum) and it gets bent so easy the nail strips won't go in. You have to gently hammer it to straighten it out to fix that problem. Also the dry fire protection activates too early. There are some nails still left and it won't work until you load another strip. Other than that, it has good balance, agressive tow nailing tip, lots of power to sink nails without stopping. I will still use it, but I'll go for Hitachi next time."
3,Disappointed,"Refurbished unit did not work from the get-go. Took it to the authorized service center in Denver where they lubed it up and restored to working order. Was told the Refurb units often sit on the shelf for extended periods and *dry out*. Worked well for small framing job...about 500 nails. Sat on the shelf for a year after that, then attempted to use again....no luck.Guessing it would work well purchased as a new unit and used consistently."
5,A real eye-opener that really moved me,"My sister and her husband have been trying to have a child for 13 years and have gone to a lot of doctors without any success. I bought this book at the suggestion of an online friend, and it really opened my eyes to the struggle my sister and her husband have been going through. The person who wrote this book really seems to let it all out, and I found myself getting very emotional at times during this book because I saw my sister going through this. I will admit that I was not a fan of adoption before reading this book but now have an entirely different view of adoption and will support my sister if she decides to go this way. This is the first time I've found a book that really shows the human side of infertility and adoption and I think anyone who knows someone having trouble getting pregnant should read it."
5,What an eye-opener!,This book truly opened my eyes to the life of infertility and adoption. For the author (Carrie) to let others inside her personal experiences is extremely admirable. It was inspirational to read about a couple's journey to become parents from her own perspective.
3,A love/tolerate relationship,"There are songs on this album that I love - the kind you repeat over and over until you learn the words (Escape Cloud is fantastic as is Cry Mississippi!) and then there are others that are fast forward material. I love the bluesy feel generated on those two tunes and also enjoy the dance numbers - which rarely make it into my collection. Overall it is pretty good but I understand why she did not win the Mercury Prize in light of the competition (Kathryn Williams, Badly Drawn Boy)."
3,Inconsistent,"This is a decent album. There are moments of real sophistication, such as 'Glove Compartment' and 'It's Not Fetish.' Jackie Joyce, a.k.a. Helicopter Girl has an interesting voice and it is best appreciated by people who like winsome female vocals.That being said this album is not as consistent as I'd like it to be. Towards the end of the album the vocals get tiresome, and there aren't enough layers to the music to really make this sort of album one would want to listen to too often."
4,First time hearing this lady,"I first heard this lady on Rod Stewart's last album and was intrigued by her voice. I was a little disappointed by her album which didn't live up to the promise of her duet. However as a debut album I thought it was inventive, I especially liked the ending, and while some tracks I think missed their mark, overall I found it pretty ggod. Subsequent recordings will only get better in my opinion as she finds herself and develops her style. I can only agree with the comment that she sounds like Eartha Kitt in slow motion. I look forward to her next CD."
4,Really Good Game,This game is a very good game. It has very good graphics and very exciting rounds. Lots of good vechicles and lots of surprises. But the only thing is it is very hard. So if you like a challeging game this is the game for you.
4,Pretty good game.,"Being a great series of games I thought it would be hard to come up with a better one. But they have. It's not the best game I've seen, but it looks good. It is very similar to the other games but you get new weapons etc. It is worth the amount of money you pay for it though. Besides it's not that much. I've liked the other army men games and this one does a good job of filling their shoes."
1,this game is a waste of money,this game was a waste of my time and money. it was way to easy to beat. i beat the game in 1 day. all of my friends that have played this game didnt think it was worth the time and money...... i should be asleep right now.
1,final front or land sea air,listen closey this game is BAD!i rented it a week ago i its so hard even on easy mode first level is impossible dont listen to ohter reviews there either lying or using a gameshark or something trust me rent it first then see for yourself or buy army men final front its better.
2,Meh.,"I noticed a little more energy, but not much else. I am not sure that I'd recommend this product to anyone."
5,gives energy,I got my package fast and well packaged. As described. Supplements seem to give me more energy. I recommend them. Nothing else to say.
1,Wrong Brand,"Why are you buying this brand? Flashy? In a ""FOIL"" pack design? Chlorella benefits are mostly due to the removal of toxic metals in your body. Why do you buy it in a metal foil pack at 3 times more money? While you have a brand next to it 3 times cheaper in a plastic capsule or powder? I use a chlorella powder (have been for a long time). My chlorella powder I receive 1 pound (16 ounces), for 25$ dollars. 1 ounce is 28 grams! each gram has 1000 millligrams! I get over 450 grams for 25 dollars! why are you buying 30 grams for a hundred dollars! Help me! Help me help you! Want it ""fresh""? Put it in the fridge!"
4,great product,This item is wonderful! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Sun Chlorella products are expensive.
2,not what I thought,this a quite dark and gruesome. I doesn't grab you from the start and is rather depressing. I can't tell the charrcters apart!!
2,Too Gory and Depressing,This was way too gory for me and that is saying a lot. Also too many programs about the East End of London!
2,Too much blood and guts for my taste,"I imagined English hospitals during that time period would seem practically medieval compared to today....and I was right. The makers of London Hospital endeavored to make it as true to the period as possible. ie bleak, dirty and scary."
4,the germs are wining.,a fair idea of how far hospital medocin has come. i am still amazed that they survived some of the procedures.
2,too gruesome,"This sounded like a great series...but the use of gore and blood in every scene was bordering on the pornographic. It seemed as though the close-up scenes of blood and guts were used to make up for a cliche,lack-luster plot. A waste of my Amazon Instant $$$."
3,checked out 1st episode,Our daughter loves this series and wanted us to watch it with her. We were just a bit too squeamish for it. Wish I wasn't. Looks great if you can handle the reality.
5,Fascinating!!,I gave it this rating as I have been in Nursing (Emergency) most of my life. This show is based on actual notes and records and it is fascinating the impact Nursing had then!
5,Why did it have to end so soon?,"I have to say this is one show that I will watch over and over again. BBC has so many wonderful shows and this one just takes the lime light. I am currently majoring in history at IU and i have to say this tv series has done well with being accurate just like all of the other shows BBC puts out. I love that BBC keeps with historical accuracy while being extremely entertaining at the same time and they always have such amazing actors as well. My only negative feed back is to say that there should have been more shows for this series, many more."
4,Interesting concept,I like the association with true stories/facts. The actors are believable and very good. I tell people it's a little downton with general hospital and history channel mixed in.
4,Unique,"This game was good at first,but after a while it gets boring, Unlike usual fighting games that I could play hours on end. I do,however,think it was clever that they tried to mix horror and put it into a fighting game. All the characters and more are back from the arcade version, but the lack of frames compared to the arcade version will disappoint you.The main reason I got this game was because I enjoyed playing Marvel Vs. Capcom, and it had not yet come out on the Playstation.My favorite character was Morrigan,so the main reason I got this game was for Morrigan."
1,Buyer Beware! Too many single edit versions,If I had known going in that there were so many single edit versions on this set I would have just downloaded from iPod.Don't buy this if you want the real Bowie songs.Only for fans of cheesey edits.
4,Bowie,"If you are not familar with David Bowie and I can't see why you would not be this is good place to start. I simply love everything Bowie has ever done so I'm a bit biased but anyway, buy this cd and get caught up to speed with what David Bowie is in the music world. You won't regret it, I promise. Then go buy his other stuff and enjoy what real music is."
3,Freshpark,"Easy to assemble and sturdy, but the incline at the top of the ramp is not sufficiently steep so the the wheels engage too early. The curve should be much more pronounced."
1,300 pages of self-congratulation,"If you'd like listening to a mid-level New York state judge talk about how great she is for 300 pages, then this book is for you. If not, you might want to read a mystery novel written by an actual writer who knows how to keep your interest (and is a little more modest).Snyder seems to think she's a hero for presiding over criminal cases and being ""tough"" on the defendants (all from the protected position of a judge's chair with lots of armed officers around her). Those of us who thought that a judge's job was to be a neutral arbiter might be taken aback, but the author prides herself on being biased.It's not clear whether the book is intended as a launch for a future political run, or as a ""look at me"" pitch to a T.V. network. If it's the latter, it probably won't work. Judge Judy is a lot funnier, and Ann Coulter (another blonde arch-conservative) is a lot sexier, judging by the picture.Ugh!"
4,Great Item!!!,"This is a good device the only low point is cause the Range like 7 feet, despite that everything is OK."
1,stupid and dangerous,"I didn't find this a bit entertaining, insightful or compassionate. This book is a piece of garbage and junk science, wrapped in a pretty package that panders to obese individuals. Obesity is a disease that eventually affects all organs and leads to morbidity and premature death. Trying to justify obesity in any shape or form while making it ""acceptable"" is criminal and dangerous. There are medical criteria for obesity and if you fit those, go seek professional help rather than waste time and money on books such as this one."
1,Ridiculous!,"If you honestly believe that calling yourself ""flabulous"" solves any sort of problem, then you deserve this book. The fact is, fat people are generally not healthy, or considered attractive. Fat discrimination is rampant, and isn't going to go away. I've spent most of my life morbidly overweight, and I finally just got sick of it - not being able to walk up stairs without breathing heavy, wearing hideous clothing, being every guy's ""friend"" and nobody's girlfriend. I'm in the process of losing weight, and I feel better - mentally and physically - than I have in years. You want real inspiration? Read ""Making the Case for Yourself: A Diet Guide for Smart Women"", or read Susan Powter. But don't delude yourself with this book. Fat does NOT have to mean foolish!"
5,Dispells myths and promotes a healthy mind-body-spirit,"Marilyn Wann is a national treasure for dispelling the myths fueling fear of eating and the fear of getting fat that infect our society and damage our physical and mental well-being. She makes the vital point that overeating and having a large size are not necessarily a cause and effect. I am a cookbook author and a proponent of Ayurveda, the most ancient health care system in the world, which states that people come in many different natural sizes. Trying to conform to one body type is both unnatural and harmful to longevity. Fearing the very substance that nourishes and sustains us is damaging. Therefore I am thrilled to see Ms. Wann take on this subject so masterfully and in a contemporary context. Well done!"
3,Great book but be careful about ordering from author's website,"I really like the book Fat!So? In fact, I liked it so much, I went to the author's website and ordered a Fat!So? T-shirt and zine for $35. That was over 10 months ago and I've never received either of them. She told me at Christmas that she'd send it after the new year. Then she posted on her own website on Feb 28th, that she'd send me one and, well, it's July and still: No shirt, no zine, no word from Marilyn. So, if you want a good read, get the book. If you want the T-Shirt or Zine, save your money. Update: Well, I finally did get my T-Shirt and a full refund (after 1 year!) Love the T-shirt. Love the book and now love the T-shirt too."
1,Ugly dribble,"So? How about being gross, slow, foul smelling, addicted, next seat on the plane nightmare etc, etc, etc... and don't forget UGLY! This dribble is nothing more than a shameless way to make money by promoting self-denial, addiction and lies. It is as degenerate as would be a book praising alcoholics, smokers or kleptomaniacs. Reality is just one look away from the mirror. To look at obese naked body is repulsive and it should be. She would accuse me of being prejudiced towards fat people which I am not. Just as I am not prejudiced towards alcoholics or smokers. What I am prejudiced about is the utter ugliness of this shameless book and the delusions it promotes."
5,wonderful,"Bodies really do vary in size. Wann is such a positive person, in a world that never wants to see fat people-let alone treat them as HUMAN BEINGS-she has helped start some activism to stop that, and that is AMAZING.Great book for anyone to read. I'll get it for my daughter someday (whether she is fat like myself or skinny like my husband!)"
4,Really liked this book,"This book was really encouraging to me. Confidence is sexy, and that's what this book offers. Love your body love yourself. Big girls shouldn't have to walk around life hunching our shoulders and hanging our heads, trying to apologize to the world for offending them with our aesthetic. Doing that is stressful, stress isn't good for health. Love yourself, be less stressed. I thought it was a lovely book."
5,Fat!So? a Fat!Yes!,"Fat!So? is a wonderful book that anyone can enjoy whether you're big or not. It's well written, witty, and informative, especially when countering popular beliefs about fat vs. thin. It's a great book to read and good to use for research or just to have comebacks to stupid remarks. Fat!So? is truly a fun and helpful book for anyone."
4,fun read,it is more a collection of info-splinters.. but it is fun to read and has some really insightful phrases that stick in your head.
5,Fantastic book!,"This book offers a fantastic political analysis of weight prejudice in our country and ways to begin to feel good about the body you have. As a practicing psychologist, I highly recommend it."
5,This book is FLABULOUS!!!,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!!! It's funny, it's serious where it needs to be, it's empowering, it's fun to read, it's well-written, it's well-documented, the graphics are outstanding (*love* the flip book illustrations in the corner of each page!!) I've never seen a book that communicates the concepts of fat acceptance and pride so well. Buy it for yourself, buy it for your fat friends and relations, buy it for anybody who needs to ""get it,"" or for anybody who ""gets it"" already but needs a recharge and a good laugh and a few dozen chances to say ""*Damn* right!! YESSS!!!"""
5,It's about damn time.,"This book was not only good for a hilarious laugh, it's also very educational. Viva la fat!"
2,This book is in the trash!,"While I completely agree that we should be comfortable with our bodies and others should either get comfortable or get out, the author takes this to extreme levels. She encourages flat-out rudeness and ,in some cases, illegal activity in the quest for fat acceptance. She encourages fat women to wear mini skirts and revealing clothes. Part of accepting ANY body type is to dress appropriately for it.The author shows that there is not conclusive evidence that obesity is a death sentence. And I thank her for that. But to encourage people to have a physical and refuse to be weighed is ridiculous. A doctor is not weighing you to degrade you. He's weighing you for a number of relevant medical reasons.If you have a doctor who is pressuring you about your weight and you're uncomfortable with it, by all means find a new one. But don't harrass the one you're with. For goodness' sake.Let's just be decent people, shall we?"
3,"Still, my kids were bored",My boys - 10 months & 23 months - just didn't light up at this video the way they do when I play Baby Neptune or any of the Baby Bach series or anything with ELMO.
5,Start Smarter,This is the second video that our son really enjoyed after Baby Mozart. He sat and watched the whole thing and seemed really into it. I like that there are words here as well as music. I also had a problem with the video itself and the company replaced it with no problem. I would recommend this to anyone. Thank you
5,Best children's video ever !,"Our children, ages 5 months and 3 years, loved this video. After seeing it for the first time, they picked it again and again. They giggled at the puppets and learned things at the same time. I highly recommend it."
1,Possible china knock off,"product was not actually a boar bristle brush, bristles are plastic like something you would find in a dollar store."
4,So far so good,"Got it within a day of ordering from amazon.com. Wasn't too comfortable ordering this from other vendors, and decided to pay the small premium.I have relatively short hair, and have always had a problem keeping my hair down in place when parting it, since it grows in all different directions.Boar bristled brushes are the only ones that do a half decent job, and the Spornette is really wonderful.My only complaint is that I wish there were more ""rows"" or bristles, as the gap between one row of bristles and the next seems too high for my liking.Still a good purchase, and totally worth the sixteen greens."
5,Best Rounder Ever!,I've had this brush for over 10 years. Still works great!It's made in Italy people!
2,a good brush with an impossible handle,I purchased the big one..disappointed.... the handle is way to small I just does not understand... usually italian products are well made ... not this. I am italian and will write to the company.
3,Good brush but the handle is too thin!,The bristle is really nice and I love it except that the handle is too thin and not that easy to hold on to while trying to dry the hair.
3,This was a gift for my mother,"I purchase the 3/4 inch, the 1 1/2 inch and the 1 3/4 inch brush by Spornette for my mother because she want to replace her current brush. She prefers natural brushes beacuse she has short, fine hair and they work best for her. The 1 3/4 inch brush by Spornette is to big for her use."
2,Spornette Italian Boar Bristle Brush 3 in. Diameter,Did not like at all--bristles are too soft to use in my hair--and not an inexpensive brush. I will not use this.
1,BAD,"Ok, buyers beware....what you get is not what's shown in the picture. The bristles fall out after one use, AND in the picture the brush is shown with rows and rows of bristles, not what you actually get. DO NOT BUY"
2,Not described accurately,It is not what we wanted...Description did not say it was bristles all around...If a picture of backside of brush or it would have said round brush we would have looked further...
2,sent them back.,"Huge!!!!! Compared to other medium size scrubs I own, these were enormous. Stiff, but I am sure washing would help that."
5,Good work,The world could go suck it. So get all the possible cash you could get. I hope you are getting some hardcore cash for this. Money is the only thing. Two thumbs up !
1,I think it's a good idea - go ahead and eat the rabbit,I used to hunt rabbits. I think they're delicious. There's lots of ways to cook them. Tastes good.
3,So stupid!,"Listen guys i been under save toby site 4 along time. Last year he threaten to kill this lil bunnie in december, and before that in september! He just wants money. Every time he gets to the dead line, he changes the date AGAIN. This time is no different. I never read the book but it looks stupid!!!! he is a crack i think. but lol it works and he got money!! i'm not below 13 i just don't have a account."
5,Hilarious book,"This book is so funny! I noticed that the Phat Phree is thanked in the acknowledgments, so maybe that's why, because they are hilarious--they wrote ""Look at My Striped Shirt!"" and a lot of other great stuff (check out their website). Anyway, I'm getting this book for all my lame vegan friends this Christmas."
1,"A disgrace, says I","Yes, a disgrace says i.... im glad people are DDOSing your webpage. Im glad people are finding ways to shut you down, and i hope someone does it in such a humiliating way, that you have no choice but to stop this nonsence"
1,What has this world come to?,"The author, publisher, and stores that are selling this book ought to be ashamed of themselves. How cruel and disgusting."
1,Mayor Scam,"Hi there. Many of you may not know this, but the date for the bunny to die, has been change several times. He first started on a 50.000$ mark or the bunny would die. A lot of atention came to the site. Paypal didn't take donations and the guy received a lot of emails from animals societys. There's even a discussion on [...] blog becouse the domain is registered trough [...]Is just another scam, becouse the bunny never dies. Of course i'm not saying the bunny should die.Anyway is really a good spin on how to make money on the internet, but then again i really dont think is ethical.Buy the book if you want, but all you are doing is giving this guy your money. No bunny will be saved.(Forgive my english, is not my native language)"
1,A bunny this good you can't eat all at once,So by Friday the 13th 2006 you have only sold 3400 books. So I guess you only get to eat one third of the bunny. That will of course mean no one will buy any more of your books but with a bunny this good you can't eat him all at once.
3,Nuetral,"What makes this interesting is their are different ways to look at it. You could see it as a sick joke, a cruel threat, or a malicious scam. Or you could see it as dark humour, a good laugh, or simply genius. And this is something Mankind is insinctive about. Manipulation, greed, and enjoyment. This man has managed to combine these 3 elements into 1 scenario. He's lying(hopefully) about this rabbit, making money, and having fun at the same time. This is what mankind has done for centuries, and will continue. Oh and by the way, Americans aren't all retards. Just most of us.=P And I'm 13, just too lazy to make an Amazon account.-The Ripper"
1,Just a thought...,"This, I must say, is trash. I am glad that I only leafed through a copy of it. Whatever happened to the day where people could go out and get a job to earn money? But, I suppose if you lack the brains and skills to do so, this is a good way to manipulate people into paying your bills so you can hang out and play PS2 or XBOX all day. I thought Toby was already supposed to have gone swimming in the gravy boat. But, since the date has changed several times, I believe the whole campaign has lost its credibility. So, to the manipulative author that wants us to pay his bills, I have only one thing to say. Go ahead and just eat the bunny already, will ya?"
3,JUST KILL IT!!!!!!!!!!,"I suppose selling a book to over 5,000 people which must have made you a lot of money is pretty clever! But come on people - its a rabbit, millions of them die every year what makes this one so special?????!!!!!!!No - i havent bought this book, i have seen it, but i would never waste my money buying a book to save a rabit when 5 minutes walk from my house there is a building that for the same price will bring you a rabit on a plate.....with sauce!The book is dull and uninteresting but i give it 3 stars for its genious!PS - its only 55p on ebay"
5,Save Toby,"It's obviously a scam. No one takes it seriously, and I'm sure the guy who made the website isn't even serious. It's funny, it's brilliant. The guy's made a lot of money. I'm dying to buy the book just to see what it says."
1,DONT BUY IT,I read a bit of my friend's. This book is terrible. They are scamming everyone with that dumb idea. Don't buy it.
5,Worked fine for me,"I installed this blade on a battery operated DeWalt 18v saw. I didn't have any issues, I was a bit nervous not using tape but it worked fine. As usual, free shipping and no taxes works out fine for me."
4,Baby butt smooth,"The title pretty much saids it all. Cuts extremely smooth and fast. Have use it a few times and was very happy with the cut. As it is a specialized blade it will spend a lot of time in the ""NOT ON THE SAW"" bin but when you need it you will be glad you have it (that's why the four star rating)."
1,Not as described,"This product (DeWalt DW9153 saw blade) was described as having tungston carbide tips and a .059 kerf. Upon opening it I found that it is an all steel blade (not tungston carbide tipped) and while the plate thickness is .054 the blades teeth are set so that the kerf is at least .092. The reason I bought this blade was for use in creating a kerf for ClampNails which require a very thin cut. I am very disappointed that the description was false, however it's cost was not worthy of sending it back.DEWALT DW9153 6-1/2-Inch 90 Tooth Paneling and Vinyl Cutting Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arbor"
1,Worthless,"Brand new out of the package, my first cut on plywood was horrible. I've had better cuts with dull framing blades. So I took it off and put a brand new Freud Diablo 24 tooth on to see if it would do better. The 24 tooth Freud cut the plywood extremely smooth with no effort, whereas this DeWalt tended to bind and load up while producing unacceptable levels of tearout. Difference was night and day.Both blades brand new. Both bought from Amazon. Both cost the same within pennies. I purchased this believing the 90 tooth format would yield smoother cuts in plywood (its a paneling blade). Wrong. The Freud blade is carbide thin kerf, whereas this DeWalt is probably stamped steel. Theres no comparison. Don't make the same mistake I did... thisFreud D0624X Diablo 6-1/2-Inch 24 Tooth ATB Framing Saw Blade with 5/8-Inch Arboris the way to go.One cut and this blade is going into the trash."
1,More junk made in China,No wonder americans do not have a chance at getting a job. All of the once american companies have contracted out most of the items that used to made in the US where we had quality control and if you made a bad product you did not stay inbusiness for very long. I cannot seem to find anything that doesn;t say made in china.
3,A convincing picture of life in the Old West...,"A Wyoming horse breeder (James Cagney) is callous in his treatment of rustlers... He hangs them from his trees in the Colorado Rockies and forces horse thieves to march barefoot over rocky terrain...Into the wild frontier of the 1870s rides Don Dubbins, a young grocery clerk from Pennsylvania, who stays to grow up under Cagney's tutelage...Dubbins seeks the love of Irene Papas (completely wasted in her first Hollywood debut), a woman Cagney has befriended, but learns she really loves the older man... Through their relationship the 'bad man with bad teeth, broken bones, a double hernia and lice' learns that justice should be tempered with mercy and reveals a warm heart that few suspected he had...Beautifully photographed in CinemaScope and Technicolor and with a sweeping musical score by Miklos Rozsa, ""Tribute to a Bad Man"" is a convincing picture of life in the Old West..."
2,thin and tight,"I like my socks to be thin, but on top these are actually a mesh and I wear a size 9 1/2 or 10 and they're much too tight. They're not comfortable at all. I regret buying them and they only cost me about $3.00."
2,Poor quality socks,"The socks slipped off my heels and were made of poor quality materials. I expected more from this brand, but athletic socks are not their forte."
4,socks are socks,These are warm socks that launder well and have held up for over a year. Well worth the price and seem to be of good quality.
3,Okay and wash well,I like these as they seem to run a bit small and my foot is about a 7 or 7.5 length. Minimal cushioning and best for warm weather.
3,Not quite what I expected,"This is more a criticism of Amazon than the book itself. I purchased this expecting full versions of 7 plays ... the ""Look Inside"" preview for this title is unfortunately of the 1977 Penguin edition, and it lists 7 complete plays in the contents:Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, and The Tempest.Of course I assumed this new edition would be the same! How disappointed I was to see that the 2004 Penguin edition only contains 4 of the complete plays, however: Twelfth Night, Hamlet, Macbeth, and The Tempest.So just be warned. If you want a portable one-volume collection of the 7 most popular plays listed above, this one is not it. If you buy this based on the preview you may be disappointed. It's a real shame too because Julius Caesar and As You Like It are two of my favorites. I should point out though there are selections from these two plays included in this volume."
4,It's the only choice you have for a correct tool...,"Buying this on Amazon was the cheapest I could find it. There's just no great deal to be had. You actually can install and remove the rocker arms without this tool, just using a screwdriver. But I wanted to have the correct 4V tool. The 2V tool works easier for the exhaust valves. The 2V tool is definitely cheapest on Amazon.To use this tool correctly, you place it on the cams NEXT to the lobe, not centered over the lobe. Use the ratchet or breaker bar on the same side of the tool as you position the swivel foot, for the best angle, which keeps the tool from sliding on the cam and scratching it."
2,Modification required,"Out of the box, tool only removed two rockers. Was not enough space to get tool into position for the rest. Take 1/4"" punch, remove roll pin holding the two piece's of the tool together. Then you can install one part on top of spring,other part under cam,then reinstall tool back together with your pin punch (not the roll pin). Oh, and I forgot to mention, Take the roll pin and through it as far as you can. This was on a 06 4.0 v-6 explorer.Dan"
2,Not typical OTC quality,"Let me preface this by stating, I don't own the tool, however my father does and he and I have been working on overhauling the top end on my 03 Explorer 4.6 2V engine and we were using this tool in the process of both disassembly and assembly of the heads. The design of this tool is not optimal as it places the fulcrum in the wrong location and thus in turn you cannot apply even spring pressure in order to get the valve keepers in place when assembling. You also run the risk of damaging the valve stem in the process. The KD tool that was 1/2 the price worked better for the task at hand during reassembly."
3,Changed it and then it worked,"I think it might work out of the box on a lot of trucks but not mine. IN the process of changing it you had to snap the pin out so I can't return the item, plus once you open the package they will not allow you to return it. Had to be modified even though it supposedly was for my Nissan Pathfinder."
3,Had to be modified to use it.,"Had to be modified even though it supposedly was for my Explorer. Might have been able to use some other device that would of cost much less. IN the process of modifying you had to break the pin out so I can't return the item, plus once you open the package they will not allow you to return it."
5,valve spring compressor,"Tool saves a lot of time if you dont want to remove the heads but need to replace valve springs/rockers/lifters/valve seals. Can be a little tough depending on how much room is under the hood, but it works great!"
2,Worthless,"I bought this book because of a fascination with the battle of Perryville but, sadly, it is, well, bad. The cover is horrible. It is badly written and the plot and dialogue are pretty wooden. The plot: Civil War breaks out so Kentucky family is is split. Lucinda has above mentioned battle in back yard and nurses Yankee soldier back to health but falls in love with crippled Reb soldier who is saved by her religion. Too bad - I still think Perryville and Bragg's invasion of Kentucky are great subjects for a novel."
4,Do you think you could win in the Ha-Ha Game?,I thought this book was okay. It wasn't my favorite but it was good. It first starts our kind of boring but when a cat named Pete gets in the story it's a different story. He gets Hank and his assistant Dover in a mess when he told them something. The coyotes in the pasture get very hungry. They get in even more trouble then. It's starts with the Ha-Ha game. Oh you should try the Ha-Ha game.
4,Steve and Ali are a winner!,"I love this movie, despite all the graphic bloodshed. I don't know why people are always trying to remake Steve McQueen films. All they ever do is fail miserably. This is one if his best; an adventurous, exciting movie, plus a love story, all in one. Steve and Ali are Doc and Carol McCoy, a couple on the run. They're racing from Texas to the Mexican border with money stolen in a bank robbery, after having been double-crossed by their partners in the heist. I highly recommend this one. Always a thrill. Watch for Sally Struthers as Fran, who's also part of the chase. She's with Rudy, who's out for revenge on Doc and Carol. Music by Quincy Jones. Stay away from the remake, and go with this one!"
4,Double Pumped Thrill Ride,"Don't be fooled by the pedigree of this film. Despite the presence of director Sam Peckinpah and star Steve McQueen this is big budget of what once was called drive-in fare. Peckinpah's signature slo-mo is on hand here but the bloodshed is rather restrained. The film starts out slowly, the bank job sequence is just so-so. Once the film hits the road, however, hold on to your hats because it's a thrill a minute. McQueen's signature cool is on hand here as Doc McCoy. Heck, McQueen makes it look so easy that you think he's coasting. You get so caught up in the action that you overlook the acting deficiencies of co-star Ali MacGraw. Effective but bizarre turn by Al Letieri (Salarzo in ""The Godfather"") as Rudy, McCoy's accomplice turned adversary. An interesting entry in the Peckinpah canon."
4,The Getaway,This movie is an oldie but a goodie. The action is great and I love Steve McQueen. I bought this movie for my father since he is a big McQueen fan. He loved it and watches it over and over.
4,Thhe Getaway blu-ray,"Disc came on time, however flimsy packaging seller used caused the disc to come off it's hub during the transit and bounce around inside the case.Perhaps a better packaging on future sold items would be a good idea."
1,"He didn't make it, neither did the film.","I waited over a year to see this film, it wasn't worth it. I wasn't aloud to see it because it was supposedly too violent. When I did see it I was really disppointed. There was very little violence at all, and what there was went too fast. In the final shootout at the end (which I thought would be a huge, explosive borderline massacre by the police) was a poorly choreographed hotel gunfight. Steve McQueen could have done better. Peace out."
1,Painful,"Steve McQueen, the classic misogynist, stars as the main character, ""Doc"", in this really bad movie. I would speak of plot, but there really isn't one. McQueen abuses his wife in the movie all of the time and she still stays with him. Maybe because he sucessfully robbed a bank. And Sally Struthers? Don't even go there. If she annoyed you in ""All in the Family"" she will drive you completely insane. Then there's Rudy, the classic character actor villian. He doesn't shoot McQueen, though, so you won't find yourself rooting for him. Or ""Doc""."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad tv movie.,"If you have never seen this movie than don't waste your time. It might have been good in the 70's, but it doesn't hold up over time. This reminds me of a terrible made for TV movie. It's no cool hand Luke."
3,Who Sam really wanted to play the Carol Ainsley McCoy role.,"Well, it wasn't Ali MacGraw for sure. Sam wanted and promissed the role to Stella Stevens. Stella was stunning in Sam's ""The Balad Of Cable Hogue"" and should have been nominated for an Oscar for it. Sam was also impressed, as it turned out to be her role of a lifetime. Sam couldn't sell it to the head of Paramount, Robert Evans though, and being married to Ali as Robert was at the time, Ali got the McCoy role for ""The Getaway"" instead of Stella. The movie is much poorer for it."
4,Steve McQueen nuff said,"cmon this movie has it all. Sure its a little campy at times but you get to see Sally Struthers naked back when she was good looking! Okay if I didnt just gross you out, you should def buy this movie, the 94 remake was ok too."
2,"""The Getaway"" hasn't aged well...","Being a big fan of both Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, I recently got the DVD of ""The Getaway."" I was largely disappointed in the film -- it looks and feels very dated. Visually, I suppose it was meant to seem innovative at the time, but it looks like a lot of the bad movie-making of the early '70s now. And the soundtrack by Quincy Jones is remarkably amateurish-sounding.My biggest complaint, however, is with the pacing of the film. The action sequences are top-notch, but when it slows down, it gets REALLY slow. It shifts gears this way several times, going from edge-of-your-seat excitement to falling-asleep boredom.This film had potential that it failed to live up to, and although the actors in it are superb, they are not directed well. Check out ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" or ""The Great Escape"" for far better McQueen."
2,The remake is much better,"Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw play lovers on the lam; she helped to bust him out of prison, but they owe a local crime lord one last heist. Sam Peckinpah is a very good action director, and those sequences do work, as do the scenes that open the film: McQueen is prison, thinking about the things dearest to him (including MacGraw). The story, though, plods along, until the climatic shootouts. I saw the 1994 remake directed by Roger Donaldson and starring Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, and James Woods, and I thought that it was much more stylish, sensual, and was better acted. Check that one out instead."
3,The Getaway,"NOT McQueen's best, but it's still a Steve McQueen movie. Ali McGraw is stunning. Some disturbing scenes, shot overlong, including one where McQueen slaps McGraw around on the roadside."
5,King of Cool,"In my opinion by far McQueen's best movie ever. One of those rare shows which pulls you in from the very beginning and doesn't let go till the very end. McQueen definitely shows here why he was ""The King of Cool!"""
4,"luck and strategy in perfect balance, easy accessible","I have played this game many times during a period of +/- 10 years, with various opponents. The game gives to most players enough opportunity to be creative and still gives everyone a chance to win. The level of experience of a player is a very strong factor in this game. Russia, when played with great caution and diligence, can determine the outcome of every game (of course under the condition that the US and England are not played to dramatically). I'm looking forward to a real successor of this game."
5,Axis & Allies,"I've played this game for a while and I must say this is a lot better than Risk. Of the 5 powers I'm either Britain or Germany. Britain's naval power can wipe out Japan and Germany's army kills the USSR. If the USSR goes down early then the Axis win, if not then the Allies win. It happens almost every time. Look for a Britain-Germany battle in Africa and a Japan-USA battle in the Pacific along with much other interseting battles."
5,My Favorite Game,"A&A is the best board game ever made. World domination is the point and this game is the pinnacle of gaming strategy. The only reason the durability is 4 stars, is that you may lose some of the pieces if you aren't careful. Its very fun although it may get boring with only 3 or 2 players. MUST BUY!!!"
4,An extremely enjoyable war game. . .,"An extremely enjoyable war game. . . if one is willing to sacrifice the time AND money. (Fifty bucks can be spent on much better things). This is an amazingly complex game, perhaps one of the best board games ever made to date. It has nearly endless possibilities, since the players can make up different options for the rules all they want, as long as they keep the gameplay fair. So why did I give the 3 stars to educational value and durablity? Because that is the truth: both factors are nothing significant. I didn't learn anything new from the game, and it's not too durable either, not that it needs to be.The fact is, the game is amazing, and is up there in the ranks with Clue and. . . Clue's ilk. Risk isn't a big classic compared to Axis. Risk PALES in comparison, my friends.Deathsmith"
5,The Greatest Game of all Time,After playing risk and loving it for many years I heard about the game axis and allies. The first time I played it I could not get enough trying all the different teams and mastering the strategy. Axis and Allies is my new addiction. I do have one complaint though; if you plan to play this game make sure to give yourself a good 4 hours as this game takes a long time. One last thing; it is lot more fun with 4 or 5 people as opposed to 2 or 3. Axis and Allies is an incredible game as well as being incredibly accurate to World War 2.
5,Excellent! Fun for anyone into strategy games!,Axis and Allies is probably my all time favorite board game out there. It takes skill to be the powerhouse of the world! I spent alot of time playing this game and have been drawn into it for hours! This Game is definitely not for someone who has ADHD! if you can't sit around with a few friends for a few hours without constantly moving then this game is definitely not for you. If you hate games that are complex and in depth then this game is definitely not for you! Me and my friends would have games that would last us 6hrs plus. some shorter. some where we would call it a day and finish up another day. But always had fun playing it. obviously or we just wouldn't spend that much time playing it. Game definitely made for beer and whatever you maybe into... like chips and dip...
5,BestBoard Game EVER!,"A&A is a very easy game to learn. The rules are straight forward and sensible. You can play A&A hundreds of times without getting bored. Like in history the Allies start off behind the proverbial eightball. If the Axis makes a single mistake it up to YOU the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces to ensure victory over the Axis. Fighting out the entire war in a single night. A&A is some of the best fun you could have, playing a board game. I recomend it to anyone that enjoyed ""Saving Private Ryan""."
4,Warfare on a Massive Scale,"""Axis and Allies"" is simply a large game with large scope. As a Second World War strategy game, it is very good and has the rare ability to take in the air war by using bomber and fighter units.The game play is relatively easy to grasp and is a very fluid and dynamic flow. There is plenty of scope to develop your forces and plenty of chance to bludgeon your enemy to a pulp.This is another game that has a lot of small parts that may need to be kept track of, which is just a small drawback. It also takes a little bit to set up before you start a game.All that said, it is a cool game and a lot of fun to play."
4,Axis and Allies - GREAT GAME!,"Great game! Lots of fun to play, but you need a lot of time and 4 friend with a lot of time in order to play the best game."
3,Way too long,"Don't get me wrong, Axis and Allies is a cool game, but nobody has any time to really play and enjoy it. It takes too long to set up and it's just like, why bother? My advice, unless you have alot, and I mean a lot of time don't get this game. It just isn't worth it."
4,Axis & Allies: Fun Until A Strategy Is Settled Upon,"When I first started playing Axis & Allies I was very impressed. It was fun game that acurrately depicted the strategic conditions of the major powers in 1942. However, after repeated play, anyone can see that the game is Russia/Germany (not unlike the real war itself.) If the Russian player is wise he will throw everything he has into Karelia at the begining of the game. The German player will have no choice but to attack with the odds against them. Whoever wins this battle (almost always it's Russia) will win the game. Xeno games has made some very similar games to Axis & Allies. 'World at War' and 'Europe at War' are far superior to Axis & Allies both in fun and replay value."
2,What an Upset!!!!,"I've had Axis and Allies for a few months now and have only played it once, and boy was I bored!!! The game in itself sounds cool, believing it to be a World War 2 version of Risk. But I was wrong. The game is much more involved and much more tedious than Risk ever was. I was none to pleased with it, possibly due to the fact that I received the game on Sept. 11 and had enough of real life War and did not feel like fantasizing about it. My word of advice, if you have never played Axis and Allies before, don't purchase it now!!"
1,Unhappy,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun becuase of all the great reviews. I was very sad to find it was not so good. This game has an instruction booklet that takes hours to read and understand and a million little pieces that dont fit well on the medium sized board. Way to complicated and long and boring. It may be interesting for history buffs who like how it tries to be realistic, but for the average joe looking for a fun game- THIS IS NOT IT! Save yourself time and especially money and dont buy this game."
1,Bad Buy,"This game was a big disapointment. It may be fun for a history buff but for the average guy it is not much fun. Game is way to long and complicated with a short novel for an instruction booklet with quotes like see appendix c of chart f5 for submarine attack phase blah blah blah. WAY TO COMPLICATED, LONG, AND NOT FUN AT ALL. BOO BOO AND BOO. Stay with risk and avoid this game at all costs."
5,One of THE BEST board games ever!,This game is by far one of the best games I have ever played! It is definately a game where you have to have a lot of time to spare when you play it. Sometimes it last us all night! Which we don't mind! So I recomend this game for those extreme board gamers!
5,A tremendous amount of fun --- but you NEED five players!,"It's like fighting World War II all over again, although rarely does the conflict go as it did historically! The great thing about this game is, even when I've been on the losing side, I've enjoyed myself immensely!If there's a problem, it's that your chances of victory are highly dependent on the ability of your allies to help you out! In one game, where I played the Soviet Union, my British allies were so ineffective that Germany was able to concentrate everything on the eastern front, and my Red Army was overwhelmed! Letting your allies down can prove tragic for the entire war effort!Still, this one is a lot of fun, and has a great feel for the era! There are more complex games on this subject, but nothing more fun!"
2,What happens next..........,"This book was not the best that Gary Paulsen has done. He just went through the book to fast. The end was a kind of dissapointment because it just stoped...""grabbed the mace from her purse and started shooting, but got the lawer instead of Al...then the court room really exploded."" The End. I would have liked to know how the court room exploded, did the lawer sue, what happened with Al and Tony. Did they stay, did they leave, what happend. In the epiloge all we learned is that they got money out of court and that his friend wants to patend new rollerblades. I would have liked it better if we had I learned more."
4,unusual tale with the voice of a teenager,"Tony's mom is an exotic dancer in order to pay the bills. When she encourages Tony's love of drawing by allowing him to sketch some of the other dancers, she is reported to the child welfare office. This very short novel is a great tale perfectly written to capture the voice of a teenager and a snapshot into an often misunderstood world. Grade: B+"
4,A RollaCoaster Ride of Fun,"Tony is the average 12-year-old boy with an average life plan: be an adult, become successful, have Corvette, and marry Melissa. The trouble begins when he adds becoming an artist to the list. With only innocent and professional intentions, he gets permission to sit in a strip club dressing room, where his mom works, to use the strippers as living models. His mom is a stripper by the way. The drawings are not only amazing but impress his art teacher who has them entered in a public show. A few days' later social services are responding to a compliant of child abuse and are at Tony and his mom's door. I read this 99-page book in 1 hour and 15 minutes. It's a fast, fun and bumpy ride. Tony is written true to form has a rambling teenager who give us a glimpse of his life normal yet not normal world. The ending is maybe a little too resolved and neat."
3,Cute but too light.,"While this book is a fun, easy read, there's not a lot of substance to it. It's written in the style of a 12-year-old boy, which makes it highly authentic but slightly irritating when applied to run-on sentences. It also perpetuates the idea of the ""good woman in the bad business"" stereotype; in this case it's Al, mother of Tony, who dances in the Kitty Kat Club but reads the classics, holds an English degree, and is a wonderful mother. All of this gives the mature Tony an opportunity to draw ""the girls"" from life without being sexually excited. So while the book is meant to be fun, and is at times funny, it's a bit too formulaic to rate more than 3 stars."
2,Better than my broken Rowenta professional,"After my Rowenta stopped working... My wife (who doesn't iron) brought this one home... I was a bit surprised at how light it was... and by the amount of leakage it had... coming from the soulplate and the water fill hole... there is no cover on it so what is to stop it from coming out there? It does keep spitting water and steam when placed in the up right position, so you could say it is a vertical steamer?"
2,Great drive until I got bad blocks,"This drive worked great for me for 1.5 years. It's fast and very QUIET. The only problem is after 1.5 years of normal use, I got some bad sectors and I had to reformat a partition (C: unfortunately) to get them marked. IBM had me do a low level format which declared my hard drive a defective device. I got an RMA and am sending it back for a replacement."
2,Not recommended,"In the first month of infrequent use, it constantly makes scratchy or ""clinking"" noises. Found bad sectors after a thorough disk scanning. It's not very reliable and just noisy when it's spinning. Fortunately I only use this drive for games and not for critical data, but I still get frustrated for losing my game data. Even though the scratchy sound seemed to have disappeared now that the bad sectors are marked, but there are still occasional clinking noises. This problems seems common in drives of this model even in other sizes (especially the 75GB)."
2,Not what I expected!!,"When they say it has a strainer, I thought they meant a ""real"" coctail strainer. But no, it's just some holes poked in the lid. Maybe it's my fault for not understanding the discription. I am disapointed!"
3,"pretty, well executed, smart","Gosh, I really didn't know what to expect with Dios. I went into listening to this EP with open ears and an open mind.And thankfully I am not disappointed!Where I think most bands fail is their quickness to jump into that alternative-pop mushy yucky sound (you know the sound I'm talking about, Jimmy Eats World, Good Charlotte, Insert-Inane-Emo-Pop-Band Here).It's refreshing to hear intelligent, beautiful, approachable music. Dios' EP is richly layered with gorgeous melodies, and precise instrumentation. Truly a gem!"
5,Movin' on up,"I saw this band six years ago at a backyard birthday party in Hawthorne in front of 5 people, and if they keep improving at this rate, they'll be better than Led Zeppelin by June. These dudes are radical. Unique yet comfortably familiar, good music always sounds right. Being cute as hell doesn't hurt either."
3,The House Of Usher. By: Edgar Allan Poe,I thought that The House If Usher By Edgar Allan Poe was average.This story has many emotions in it. I thought that it was bizare because Ushers Sister Madline came back to haun t him. The narrator and Usher thought that they buried Ushers sister alive. Madeline ghost had came up and killed Usher and then the narrator had ran out of the creepy house and the narrator turned around and the house was falling apart.by: Torie
3,Some great information but not worth purchasing,"I borrowed this book from the library to see if it was worth purchasing. It has some great design tips and ideas but nothing that can't be found in other books in greater detail. The glossy color pages make it fun to browse through, but there isn't enough detailed information on the various design topics.I skimmed through the book within two or three days and don't see it as an item I will bother to purchase for my personal Web design library."
1,HIGHLY over rated.,Spends more time promoteing the authors instead of teaching you how to actually design.
2,Generally overrated,"I bought this web design book 2 weeks ago based on the reviews ... . It was actually a disappointment. Upon completion of the book I had seen a lot of nice web designs by Robin Williams' design firm but I still didn't know how to even begin my own design except that I needed to shell out [money] for Dreamweaver or GoLive. The attitude of the authors appeared to be ""good web design takes years to learn so why don't you just hire us to do it for you"" instead of actually teaching the reader. If you're a beginner like me, try ""Learning Web Design"" by Jennifer Niederst instead. I learned more in the first 25 pages of it than in the whole Williams book."
5,Gorgeous and Compelling,"I've listened to this album for years and it never grows old. The voices--one piercing and clarion, the other dusky and wan--are perfect complements, and the lyrics, smoothed to perfection by the decades, are some of the most beautiful I've ever heard. I also *highly* recommend the Silly Sisters' other album, No More to the Dance."
5,"Great (as usual for the permformers), but not rolicking","As usual, they were fantastic. But I don't pick this CD when I want to get in a great mood and rumba (!). It's good background and listening music, played and sung brilliantly."
3,Decent Rap/Dance CD,"Probably the most popular song on ""Electronic Pleasure"" would have to be the Bee Gees-looping rap of ""Stayin' Alive"". I remember this track mainly from the 1995 sci-fi thriller ""Virtuosity"", but I wouldn't list this song under one of my favorites. In my opinion, the original Bee Gees version was better than this one.My two favorite tracks on ""Electronic Pleasure"" would have to be #6 (""Set You Free"")-- the longest song on here (just over 7 minutes); it starts out slow with piano and background thunderstorm/rain, then eventually speeds up-- and #7 (""Softly (Dragging Me Down)""), a slow, ocean-themed song.Almost all of the tracks on here are fast (except for tracks #7 and 11) and about half of them include rapping. So, if you like dance and rap, then you'll probably like this CD. There are also lyrics for every song, even for the short spoken-word intro, ""What's Your Pleasure?"" Worth a listen if you're an N-Trance fan."
5,Great Book,My all time favorite book! I love how Hannah Howell writes about the passion and romance between the characters!
2,not pleasantly surprised,"I Love Hannah Howell's books, and usually you get the great romance scenes from the beginning, but half way thru the book I was struggling to continue. I read a book a day, and this one was taking me forever to get into. I was surprised. I would still recommend but know it is not as good as all her others :("
1,"Uh, ""0 Stars""","This is the worst game ever.This is the worst thing we've created.This is the worst thing we've done.This is the worst thing the universe has done.This is the worst thing any universe has ever done.Alright, I admit I'm exaggerating. Still, look up ""Waste"" in the dictionary and you'll see the artwork on this game's box.Several good reasons to avoid this game:1. You can't make ""movies,"" but rather ""cartoon shorts.""2. Your ""scenes"" can only be a little more than a minute long.3. They choose both the characters AND what they say FOR you.What a rip-off.Neither buy nor rent."
2,"Barely acceptable, not impressive","This is a recording of the play performed in Santa Monica, California, under what were apparently less than ideal circumstances. None of the three performers sounds even vaguely Hispanic, and some of their acting is quite strained. I heard a copy which had undoubtedly been much-played and which had been subject to who-knows-what storage conditions, but the audio quality was atrociously bad: all of the sound had a ""shadow"" running several seconds ahead of the main presentation of audio. Schubert's titular quartet (which appears on the tape one generation down, out of necessity, since it ""appears"" as an audio tape played during the recording of the play) did not sound as if it had been performed by top drawer musicians; this may have been a fault of the poor sound quality, but it didn't move me as it should have. The motion picture is much, much MUCH better than this recording of the play."
5,Great Case...,"Have only had this case a short time, but it has quickly became my favorite. Holds guns securely and has more than adequate pockets for storage of extra clips, ammo or range gear. Durable and the carrying handle/strap are balanced nicely."
2,Tough read,"I recall reading this a while ago; I don't remember a lot about this book, but I do remember it being very difficult to get through. The language was very different. You had to really think about what the writer was attempting to express which made the flow of the story tough at best. I guess it could be called literary, which I tend to stay away from because I rarely get anything out of those types of works.While I applaud the writer for being different in that she uses unusual techniques to get across her message, it is imperative that a reader be able to understand the story, or else they are not going to be edified. Just write with simplicity and effectivness and hopefully it will make things go a whole lot easier."
4,Looking back into history with all the warts.,One of my ancesters comes from this area and I was looking for some information about the area and the people who lived in this Parish.This book covers all of the history in great depth and all the local districts.
5,i'm no expert but...,i was given a copy of this cd (copied from a record) by a friend. unfortunately all i know is that it is a compilation of japanese dj/producers/artists journeys with world music. awesome beats and intriguing vocals add up to an album that is worth every cent that you paid for it... if you are a fan of recordings from the label 'spiritual life' joe causell et al. you are thoroughly in need of this musical adventure. enjoy the arual pleasure that is the 'bananna connection'. full apologies for not being more knowledgable of artists/contributors etc.
5,Get this book!,"""Thank you, Dr. King"" is one of the rare books I like that is spun off from a tv show. It's from the Little Bill series and I think it's the best book out there for Preschoolers dealing with celebrating Dr King day. Racism is hard to talk about with a child. It's not impossible, but hard. The importance of Dr King is especially hard to teach since a lot of what he fought against is gone and young children like concrete things. Basically, this book says that we celebrate Dr King day because he helped make it so everyone can be friends. I am very sad to see the Nick Jr has canceled Little Bill. It was our favorite for a long time and helped me in not only raising a thoughtful child, but it also set the example of why multiculturalism is important and what it's like to be a little kid in a big city!"
3,Know what you're buying,"Like another reviewer, I purchased these and was so excited when they arrived. I couldn't wait to put stuff on my stainless steel refridgerator. But THEY are stainless steel...not made FOR stainless steel. Oh well. My mistake."
5,Grouden Rocks,My Son absolutely loved this toy. These are not readily available in retail stores in my area so none of his friends have one. I think he enjoys being the only kid on the block with one!
2,This book could have been so much more.,"I purchased this book with high hopes that it would provide some insight into why someone would follow a band through many years and tours and what impact it would have on that person's personal life. Obviously the music and persona of U2 has had that impact upon Ms. Ebertt Beeaff's life, but this book is a curious recitation of endless versions of the same thing. ""I went. I saw this set and they sang this."" There must have been different responses to the concerts in different countries and cities, but there is no hint of that in this book. This book is curiously flat in affect and just drones on. The spirit that drives one to love U2 enough to commit to a major disruption in the author's adult life is never answered or explained. It was very disappointing. There were some enticing tidbits of encounters with the bandmembers, but they are few and far between. I finished the book, curiously dissatisfied. Still wondering. . .why?"
1,No wonder it's shrinkwrapped!!!,"I've read some very eloquent and inteligent reviews on this book, especially from that Savala fellow. I don't have the same analytical skill, but what I do know is that this book made me embarrassed to be a ""die-hard U2 fan"" and it gives the rest of the world a silly view of how rediculous a U2 fan can be. Is this woman really a fan? Or does she simply have a school girl infatuation with Bono? There's no depth, no heart, not even a glimpse of how the greatest band on Earth relates to the world around her. It's all about her. Just her and her stalking sessions of U2 band members. Get a life, lady. It's cool that a fan can write a book about U2 and get it published, but at least write a good one for pete's sake. This book doesn't do U2 justice and it doesn't do the real fans any justice."
1,skip this one,"This book is not very good. The only thing I really got out of it is that U2 should be afraid of some of their fans... She really does not paint a fair picture of many of the ""die hard"" fans out there..."
3,Time Crisis: Crisis Zone,"Great shooter game like it's predecessors Time Crisis 2 & 3. You start of with a machinegun instead of a handgun, (trust me you'll need it). One major drawback however is that it's only a one player game and you cannot use two guns when playing as one player. The instuctions say you can use two GUNCON 2 controllers for portions of the game, however after playing two levels of the game, I have not found a way to activate it. You might have to earn the ability to use two guns. I am very ticked-off about this. Maybe after playing the game more I'll figure it out. I've only played the game for 2 1/2 hours before writing this review. Thought I would warn potential buyers before they purchase it. Still, it's a Kick-B*tt game, but would be much better if you could use 2 guns."
3,Stingray,"Fast paced game with great graphics however, Unlike Time Crises 2 and 3 its somewhat mindless in the sense you point the machine gun in the direction of the bad guys and just shoot.. This game has one gun, at least in the early levels you can use the machine gun only. The bad guys in this game are hard to kill meaning you have to shoot them multiple times to kill them. In Time Crisis 3 some of the bad guys have to be shot up to 5 and 6 times however in this game all but one of the characters require nearly a full clip resulting in multiple reloads. I get the sense I am playing the same screen over and over with the only real change being the back drops. I hope it gets better, I have played through the second level up an to this point. Crisis Missions are near impossible but at least a little different. For more pin point shooting that requires a little skill rather then luck, I would say stick with Time Crisis 2 and 3."
3,"A decent game, but way too difficult to finish completely.","This first installment in the Time Crisis series, like the superb sequels, I played in the arcade. Though you did get to use a real big gun(really cool!)and though along with rapid bullet spray you could last for a while and claim your evil victims(like all games in this franchise, I imagined they were poachers)there is one big problem. It has so much way to go, and at least in the arcade, you need 4 coins for a start and continue, and never have I had that sort of money on the times I got to play it. Still, I have been able to do some good in the game, and the way the enemy men fall over or explode when you get them is pretty neat. So all in all, this is an OK game. If you can't find any other games you like but this one, you should play it. Don't, however, if there are more fun ones. The point is, this game is alright, but I have played better ones. So three stars as it is decent and only decent. At least not the worst. End of review."
5,Track Listing for a great CD,1. Out Of The Danger Zone 2. Under The Son 3. Rock Solid <-my Fav 4. Teenage Suicide 5. Strength Of Love 6. Brother Against Brother (It's Not Right) 7. War With The World 8. Stand 9. Radical 10. When The Son Begins To Reign
3,Take this tip,They are not keeping up with the new tips needed such as #34 or those for new netbooks.
3,It's okay,This book was okay. Nothing great that stood out. My kids weren't really into it. Good Biblical content but the movie theme seemed. Bit silly.
2,Derivitive,"This book is an interesting look at the Morris Canal, but it's style and layout owe a lot to James Lee's previous (and superior) illustrated histories of the Morris Canal. Seek those out if you can find them."
2,Shoddiest manufacturing I've ever seen,"Don't even try to punch out the pieces of this game by hand -- use a sharp knife. Otherwise, they WILL get bent and broken. It's impossible to believe that they could be manufactured by the same company (Hasbro, which owns Parker Brothers, Milton Bradley and now Avalon Hill) that made the sturdy, HARD plastic pieces of Fortress America. Also, the pieces don't fit particularly well in the bases.The wave of board games imported from Europe in the past several years shows consistent attention to high quality of component manufacture and design. Hello! America is supposed to be the world leader in manufacturing ingenuity! Why are we making junk like the pieces in Lionheart?As for game play, it's like a cross of chess, Stratego and miniatures battles. Thing is, chess is better, Stratego is better and miniatures games are better. Really, Lionheart has nothing to recommend it."
4,A good game,"This is really more my husband's kind of game than mine, but I have to admit I do like to play this with him. I imagine people who are used to more complex war and strategy games may tire of this fairly soon, but I still enjoy it months after buying it. I also think when my children are a few years older it will come in handy with critical thinking skills. Be prepared however, setting this up the first time is a pretty involved task- the night my husband and I first set out to play, it took us so long to punch everything out, that we never actually ended up playing."
4,Lionheart: the early 90's Gem,"I picked up a DAMAGED version of this game recently. However, there was plenty of fun to be had. It plays very simply, taking my friend and I only minutes to grasp the simple rules, and we played a few games. Without noticing, about 3 hours had passed us by. The simple dice based combat adds a randomized element that makes this game less intimidating. The variation in units and rule sets makes this game variable and allows for unique battles every time."
1,Overpriced at any price,"One of the lamest, shoddiest ""strategy"" board games. Apparently inspired by historical miniature combat rules, because of its crowded, gridlocked board, this piece of junk ends up being nothing more than Stratego with dice. The pieces are of such soft, low-quality plastic that it'll be a miracle if you can cut them out of the sprues without breaking at least two (and you will have to cut them out, with a knife -- try to do it by hand and you'll trash many more than two).Oddly enough, there's a game available from Rio Grande Games called Löwenherz, which MEANS ""Lionheart,"" that's really, really good."
3,Low replay value,"This is a fun game the first couple of times, but after that the inordinate care required to keep the pieces together starts to drag and you realize that it's really not that much different than games like Stratego or Chess which have durable pieces and usually involve a lot less luck.Overall, I'd say this is a good game for adult collectors to play a few times then scavenge the pieces into something else. I don't think I'd give it to a kid though - the broken pieces would bum either you or the kid out (probably both)."
4,More Sophisticated Britney,"A very good pop album with dance tinged songs and a few ballads thrown in. In a world of Britney and Christina, this is a more sophisticated take on the pop music scene. It handles a broader range of topics i.e. first single ""Two Faced"" which deals with back stabbers. She is huge in England and has yet to get Air Play in North America. I don't know why as she is a cut above the competition. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable CD. Her other CD's, available only as imports are worth checking out as well."
3,The chapter on Filters is stellar!,"This is worth getting the book by itself. Paul is truly a dynamic and well thought out author and coder and explains in simple, cleear, and coherent examples."
1,Do not waste you money,This book basically is a collection of paper from different writers. Most writers look like only know some script language but not C or C++. A lot of content is duplicated. Different terms are used in different places. I hope QUE can save the paper for the forest and buyer can keep the money in their packet.
1,Didn't work with my system!,"I have a satellite dish, and didn't realize until we got this vcr all set up that it wouldn't work with the dish! We started with the setup menu, and tried to program it to record, and it wouldn't recognize the satellite channels! It is going right back to Amazon[.com], and hopefully the next one we try will actually be compatible with the dish. If you have a satellite, don't even bother with this vcr. I am sure it is wonderful, but we didn't even get as far as putting a tape into it, and now we have to pay to have it shipped back. How frustrating!"
4,Super Small Scope,"I volunteer at The Living Desert in CA and do nature walks with adults and children, this small scope is easy to carry and has really helped me bring birds and animals up close and personal. I would not recommend for use with small children because you need a steady hand to really get a good view, much better than carrying bulky bino's for fun use."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Great for concerts, bird watching, anywhere you would take binoculars, but light and fits in the palm of your hand."
4,Functional and Simple,I've used both Symantec's Ghost and Power Quest's Drive Image 2002. Both have serious deficiency when used with Windows XP in the NTFS format. Backup My PC is easy to use and does the job as advertised. Stay away from Drive Image 2002 and Ghost unless your into self-abuse.
1,Not Reliable,Do not rely on this product for backups. It backs up some files to a zero length file which means you see your file backed up but it is really empty and useless. It also skips files within backups willy nilly. You can backup an entire set of folders and files and think it was succesful. Upon review you find numerous missing folders and file.I have experimented with the configuration extensively but MyPCBackup is a ONE STAR product.
1,Bad Reviews,"I don't own this product but I was sold by the mfr's website info but thought I'd better check the product out here before I buy. Well, after reading about the lack of Customer Service response, as well as the loading and opening of software problems, I don't think I want to buy this product. The version offered here is 4.71 but the mfr has upgrades to v4.8. The problem I have with this is later on you may be eligible for an upgrade if you originally purchased the v4.8 but not for v4.7x. I want the latest version possible when I buy. No thanks, I'll pass on this one."
1,Does not work for all operating systems,This program does not work for all systems. Evidently there is some problems with OEM systems.If you go to their web site and find their forum you will find a they have a solution for XP Professional. It involves modifying the registry. You have to try to follow an animation rather than a step by step guide.My problem is with 2000 Professional. Backup PC will not start.I hope they develop a work around for 2000 Professional and a way to follow it without trying to keep up with the animation.
2,backup mypc,"...THE FIRST COPY OF BACKUP MYPC WOULD NOT LOAD. BACKUP MYPC WORKS VERY WELL ON WIN98SE HOWEVER WE HAVE JUST CHANGED OVER TO WIN2000PRO AND IT IS DEFINATLY NO GOOD FOR DISASTER RECOVERY FOR THIS OS. IT TAKES SIX 1.44 FLOPPIES, THE WIN2000 INSTALL DISK AND MY BACKUP SETS TO GET THE SYSTEM UP. THEN THERE WERE ERRORS REPORTED. ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER, EXCEPT FOR DATA, TO DO A NEW INSTALL. SINCE THEN WE HAVE USED NORTON GHOST... REASONABLE PRICE. THIS SOFTWARE IS AWSOME FOR WIN2000 USERS. IT BACKS UP DRIVE TO DRIVE OR DRIVE TO MULTIPLE CDRS..."
1,Lack of Version #,I will never buy any item where the seller does not state the version designation.
3,Backup MyPC,"Software works great. The only complaint I have is that you can not schedule backups to occur when you are logged off the system. Their solution seems to be to put the computer in ""Standby"" and set the scheduler to ""wake"" the sytem to perform the backup. This is not a viable solution for a system that needs to be visible as a network resource. I would like to schedule my backups to occur during the night, but I can't because if I logg off (for security reasons) the backup does not run. If I put it in ""stanby"" my computer is no longer available to other users. I know this is designed more for the home user, but it wouldn't have killed them to include a more flexible scheduler."
1,No tech support,"Stomp's tech support is non-responsive and unable to resolve a problem I'm having with Backup MyPC software. Repeated emails to them result in no response or a stupid response - like uninstall and re-install the software. Been there done that, don't purchase this junk!"
1,Refuses to start for me,"I bought this partly on basis that it uses the Veritas backup software engine, which my company has used successfully for years.So, it installed just fine, but when I go to start it, it throws out a mostly incomprehensible error message about a DLL and refuses to start up.Before writing this review I wrote up a support request through the Stomp software site - will just have to wait and see what response might come back to me."
1,The program locks up - No customer Support,"If your looking for a product with some customer support, look elsewhere. This product consistently locks up and you have to go the OS's task list to kill it. When problems are reported to Stomp, they are NEVER answered. Buy a big hard drive and just copy your files to it for backup - this product is useless."
4,Very Good,"I've been backing up since the preferred media was a cassett tape. Backup software is a black art to be sure... NTI has been very problematic on mine (Ath 1600+, 512ram, XP Pro) and Stomp is aces. It saw my Liteon 40x12x48x no problem (4.71 & 4.81 both). It will span media, just that a stupid window can make it seem like it won't. Go ahead and burn. As to complaings about cust serv, if you still believe in O/L help (in all but the rarest), I have a tooth fairy to sell you."
4,Hollywood Decorating,"The Orlando Sentinel called this ""a study of sophisticated style with touches of what we see as Hollywood Glam."" Think gold and satin and curves. I like adding a few glamour touches to a room, but guess I'm not ready to redecorate the whole house like a Hollywood scene. If you like oversized accessories and bright colors, this is the book for you.Another book to consider is Modern Glamour: The Art of Unexpected Style by Kelly Wearstler."
4,"VERY, VERY COLORFUL; LIKE MR. DRAKE MUST BE","MR. DRAKE MUST BE A FUN PERSON TO KNOW....HIS INTERIORS ARE VERY, VERY COLORFUL AND FUN TO LOOK AT ..I WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE DAY TO DAY WITH ALL THAT BUT IT'S FUN TO KNOW HIS CLIENTS LIKE TO LIVE THAT WAY....THE COVER OF THE BOOK IS VERY CREATIVE JUST LIKE THE MIND OF MR. DRAKE ...LOOK AT THE BOOK ON A CLOUDY,RAINY DAY AND YOUR SPIRITS WILL BE LIFTED......."
4,very colourful indeed,Jamie isn't fond of beige or bland interiors and it shows in this new book. Very well executed and photographed. The cover is made of vinyl in a shagreen look. Very nice. I wish more publishers would do this.
3,Very detailed and well written but is a little slow,"Sarah writes with all her emotion and holds nothing back. She writes very detailed however at times it can be a little slow in parts and I found myself trudging through it at times. However, it was an interesting view from a young woman in Civil War times with two brothers in the army and a brother who had been involved in a duel."
4,The Civil War Diary of Sarah Morgan,"Having just finished reading ""Mary Chestnut's Civil War"", I came across this during my searches and thought it would be interesting to see how Sarah Morgans story compared to that of Mary Chestnut.This diary is very different to that of MC but it certainly provides a different perspective as Sarah was much younger than MC and it shows in the writing. It is just as good in its own way and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see how civilian life was affected by the civil war. A most entertaining read."
3,Sarah's Dairy,"This is a very interesting view of the Civil War. I always thought that my children were the ""ME"" generation. Maybe I was wrong. The young upper-class in the South were also a ""ME"" generation. Just like the young Confederate soldiers had to learn to be a good soldier, the Southern Belles were also forced to grow up and do what was needed to survive the war. I am sure there were some that continued to be the spoiled, but they were in the minority. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
4,reminiscent of the 1970's,"This is a tidy little compilation of recipes that will take the older cooks back to the 1970's. In fact, it was written in 1974. It starts out with an article on clothing and equipment for the woods. Then the author talks about ""You and the Total Environment"". From there it goes on to tell the reader about ""Basic Foods for Good Nutrition"". Are you starting your trip to the past yet?Sprouts, honey and bulghar are some of the ingredients that you may see in the recipes. Barley Rice burgers, soy patties, and lentil soy loaf are three names that should tell you what type of cookbook you will be looking at. Whether you are on a health-food kick, looking for vegetarian ideas or just enjoy taking a look at the past, this is a clean, no-frills cookbook that highlights a high-fiber diet with no meat. There are no colorful pictures and the book ends with an article on edible wild foods. Frank and unadorned the book stays with the theme: a simple life."
3,"shear and combo for simple things. not fancy, gets the job done.","nothing fancy. gets the job done for a beginner. inexpensive, made in Pakistan. regular hair cutting, I'd get a more professional set."
4,for the msce's,this book seems to be the best in those that i have seen by my own eyes. Try it i am sure it won't let you down. This all i can say becouse iam an aspiring mcse student. I have alreaduy tried some books but this is just giving me the real things i need. If you're a Mcse please write to me.
1,It's a mess,"Chapter 2 in the book is EXCELLENT. Step by step on how to install and setting up and project.After setting up everything from chapter 2, when you start learning Hibernate, this is what you're going to get:1. Examples in the book do not match the code2. The codes aren't complete3. Authors walk you all over the place. You'll get even more confused after reading this book4. Sample codes in the book aren't clearMy opinion:I think the authors wrote this book while doing something else. The ideas are not focus."
1,dfficult to follow,"The book does not do, what the title say's I brought the book to get knowleged of Hibernate quickly, after reading the first few chapters several times, I was not able to follow. In the first few chapters alone, there are several typos, which mis leads.Now I am going through Hibernate Made Easy by Cameron McKenzie, which is very easy to follow and makes reading interesting."
1,Misleading Picture,"I'm not much into painting, therefore the numbers mean nothing to me....I ordered these for my child thinking that as the picture shows, there are 12 different sized brushes, and would make her paint by number picture easier to paint. Instead I received 12 of the same size brushes, thick therefore useful in most paint by number projects."
2,Dull & Boring Movie,"I wouldn't watch this again, it was so boring! Simon Baker was the only highlight of it, too bad Jared Leto didn't have a more exciting role."
3,doesn't stack up,"This is another movie about the 60s/70s with all the sex, drugs, and rock & roll. But this one doesn't quite stack up to the others. There are two storylines, that never really converge. I'd say the acting is ok, it's an ensemble cast, but no big names in there, nor any stellar performances. The soundtrack is good, but other than that, this movie doesn't add anything that those that came before have. Maybe check it out on cable."
1,I hated this film!,"I was SO dissapointed when I saw this movie. Comparing itself to Almost famous and Boogie Nights! I don't think so! This film was so boring, and it actually was getting into action like the last 20 minutes of the film. The music was horrible, it sounded like ""modern rock"" kind of music, not 70's music. Some of the clothes were all wrong(except for Adam goldberg's wardorbe). Jared Leto was trying to be like Jim Morrison, but it did not come out right(I do admit he looked sexy, and was the best actor in the film though, so kudos for Jared). The scenes at the whiskey a go go, were OK. This film just did not feel like 1972.Buy Almost Famous, it's the best rock movie ever!"
1,THIS is an electric fuel pump?,"What came in my package is not what was pictured. What is pictured is an electric fuel pump with an input and an output. What came in my package was a cam-driven MECHANICAL fuel pump with four ports. It was $25, so as the saying goes: ""If it's too go to be true, it probably is."""
1,Fits ????????,"What the H-LL??????Listed as Fitting a 92 CAMRY, BUT when looking at ""Fits These Autos"" Where the H-LL does it say CAMRY????Amazon FOULS the AIR once again, and of COURSE, they say, ""WE ONLY PROVIDE WHAT INFO THE VENDOR SUPPLIES...""TTTHHHHHHHPPPPPPTTTT!!!!"
1,Don't buy this book!,"Despite the scholarly sounding title this book is nothing more than a brief collection of short entries--anecdotes, recipes, snippets of history--mingled with misinformation.Among other errors, the author confuses the tea tree (genus Melaleuca), a native tree of Australia, with the tea plant (Camellia sinensis)!"
1,"Not Authoritative, Thus Not Very Useful","I found reading this book to be like riding a bicycle and having the wheels fall off every half mile or so. As the Reference Librarian has already commented, the book lacks coherence and credibility.I would give this book 0 stars."
1,Lofty Title for a Pile of Nonsense,"""Tea"" does not contain a table of contents, nor does it have an index. These were most likely omitted because they would require organization and actual information, both of which are lacking in this stack of paper.""Tea"" seems to be a collection of tea related trivia - some of it inaccurate, most of it useless. A few sentences on a page comprise the entire body of data for most ""topics"".The rather lofty title ""Tea - A Cultural History From Around the World"" does NOT reflect the content of this pile of nonsense. It might be better titled ""Not So Accurate Trivia About Tea Presented in Random Order"".""Tea"" might be appealing to those with very short attention spans and/or those who don't want to know a thing about tea."
4,Worked just as described,"The local installer was a bit of a chump but he did good work and was super affordable. I recommend this card around Northeast Ohio, but make sure your area is service by someone decent."
2,Unsatisfied,"The packaged arrived in a good time, in good packaging, and the tape cleaner itself had a brand new look, undamaged in anywaySo why am I giving 2 stars ?, simple, this wet head video cleaner came incomplete, it did not have the video head cleaner formula, but when I go to other sites and research it, its supposed to come with the cleaner formula.So it's an incomplete package, very unsatisfactory."
2,it's okay,i didn't like the material of this skirt especially the black and white one i don't like it it's feels it's for old ladies
4,Practical advice.,"While the book is not extensive, the recipes are very practical for the American kitchen, requiring a minimum of exotic ingredients. Keeps Ethiopian cuisine from being too daunting to try."
2,Not impressed,"I ordered 2 different cases for my cheap little phone (free, actually - came with my account)I was not impressed with this case. See my review on the one I did like."
5,Cecille Licad performs Chopin,"I've listened to many Chopin recordings, LP and CD and I would definitely include this on my Desert Island. There is nothing sentimental to convey unless it's already there in the music of Chopin. Cecile Licad shows and exemplifies Chopin with fulsome grace and humility personified without any outward technical pyrotechnics to draw attention away from the music. It's so wonderful to hear a pianist who is able to communicate. This in itself is a challenge most pianists are not adept (in Chopin), to be musical without drawing attention to the technical. She simply let's it flow and sing. Lastly there are no technical hurtles to overcome. Cecile simply does the music and it's overwhelming in it's naturalness and yet so grandly expliciit in the message conveyed. Don't listen to critics and their reviews (drivel)about techical shortcomings. It's all hogwash!! This is a glorious, joyous and lovely CD."
2,Where's the Calcium?,I found it rather unusual that the calcium percentage to be rather small for the size and price.
1,"Received, the product has expired,","I bought it, February 25, 2012.International transportation and customs policy issues, I received on May 7The product label is shown: expires in April 2012.How can I do? ? ?"
2,Vencidas,"Compre las pastillas 2 x 1 para que me durarán todo el ano y resulta que vinieron con la fecha de vencimiento en abril del 2012. Malo, malo."
2,Not enough Calcium,each pill is only 185 mg of calcium.The U.S. FDA's Recommend Daily Allowance is 1000mg per day.at this rate you need to take 6 pills per day for an average person.doctors recommend that anyone with a calcium defficiency should take 2000mg a dayso if you are taking these due to a difficiency than you need to take 12 pills per day.
3,Take-Two!,"The supplement itself seems to be fine. However, I was disappointed to learn after receiving my order that the dosage was TWO caplets and not one. The reason I ordered this product was I was attempting to reduce the overall number of pills I was taking."
2,Pretty Weak Calcium Content,The only thing I can say about this calcium is that typically when I take calcium I notice my nails growing at a faster rate and they seem thicker/stronger. The entire time I took this calcium they grew normally. When I got back to liquid calcium the difference was obvious.
2,it's about to expire,It's very disappointing to receive the two bottles with 4 months to expire. I don't think I can consume it in time.
4,Son is a Yankee fan...,I purchased this product for my 19 year old son who is a huge Yankee fan. He's watched it several times since receiving it for Christmas and loves it. This last summer he was able to go to New York City with his dad and see a game in the old stadium before it was closed...lasting memories that are relived when he watches this video.
5,boy this movie is good,this is a very nice hight scool movie of the 76's specialy for peaple that like to party smok pot drinck beer and just have a good time i liked the music very mutch and the style. i recomend this movie to everyone. boy that i like to return in the 76 and party AGAIN
5,Favorite movie of all time!!!,"Like any good movie, Dazed keeps calling my name when I'm at the video store. Watch me, Joe. It says. So for the 30th and 40th time I do. Amazing music, amazing actors, amazing story about growing up. It in gulfs you in humor, amazing acting and some great great quotes! Everyone needs to check it out. As Slaterson says ""Check ya later!"""
5,A perfect edition for die-hard fans,"Dazed and Confused is a fantastic comedy that's equal parts funny, insightful, and feel-good entertainment. The Criterion edition does a fantastic job with the transfer, also packing in a ton of extras, including a poster and a companion booklet. This blu-ray is a must-own for true fans of the movie."
4,One nagging little thing...,"This is supposed to be set in Texas, yet only one character speaks with a southern accent!! Everyone else sounds like there from Cali or the midwest. Otherwise this is an excellent portrayal of high school life pre ""Just Say No"". The characterizations ring true and I like the fact that no one person is the ""star""."
5,one of the best movies ever,If you are a rare few that have not seen this...I pity you. IT's a cult classic. It affected my friends and I so much that we brought back the 70's just act out scenes!!
2,Boring,"The director certainly captured the look and sounds of suburbia circa 1976 with the soundtrack and wardrobe. I'll give him credit there. However, the one thing this movie really needed was a good story with characterization. It just never took off. We follow several groups of teenagers on their last day of school as they roam aimlessly around town getting high and acting like idiots. You never really get a chance to learn more about these kids so you can at least like them. Instead, we are presented with several unmemorable ""main"" characters who never quite get developed. Was it the disgruntled high school quarterback or the freshman Mitch? This movie has a hard time deciding. If you want a good 70's nostalgia movie I'd recommend ""Detroit Rock City"" or even ""Over the Edge"" which was actually filmed in 1979! Both of these movies have interesting stories and characters set against the backdrop of the late 70's. Both are worth purchasing. Dazed and Confused, on the other hand, is just a renter."
1,YAWN !!,"This is a very boring movie. I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did. The only time I thought ""aha!"" was when the credits finally rolled at the end. A bunch of high-school kids are hanging out doing drugs, supposedly as cool rebels against conformity (many have perfectly blow-dried hair and drive their own cars nonetheless). They get in trouble with the usual people: parents, the coach, cops (yawn). You'd expect it to build up to something remotely dramatic, I don't know, a romance, a crime, an accident, a broken heart, a sports event, SOMETHING!! but no, it just ends. In fact it could have ended an hour earlier and left you with the same feeling that watching C-Span would have been more interesting. Breakfast Club was much better."
1,Maybe I was on a different planet,"Having graduated from high school in 1975, I was somewhat intereted in seeing this movie. I generally don't watch R rated movies, but at the insistance of one of my kids, I watched it. The sets were authentic, as were the costumes, makeup and music. But the 'everybody's drunk or high' atmoshpere? I just didn't see it when I was going through high school. In the end I saw it as nothing more than my kid's attempt to get me to condone or lighten up on his lifestyle."
1,This film was awesome!,"This movie should go down as one of the most enjoyable and wonderful pieces of cinematography in history. All the characters, drama, and the comedic value is amazing. A must see!"
1,you might like this...,"if your idea of funny is someone pretending to be high. otherwise, you will be very bored."
1,Terrible.,"A terrible film. Aweful story, lame characters, the only good thing about it is that eventually it ends."
4,Yep...that's the way I remember it.,"This was exactly the way I remember it in the 1970's.(Except for the spankings) What really blow's me away is that today's kids would be shot for doing all the things that came naturally to us back in the 1970's.MADD has changed everything.Gas, Grass or Ass, nobody rides for free!"
4,"Watch, or you'll miss life...","I've got a thousand words max in this review and its nowhere near enough to describe how awesome this movie is...I know its a cliche, but its fitting and seemed destined to say for this film - ""You don't know what you're missing..."" This film by Linklater is by FAR the best teen flick ever made.Linklater must be a genius for compiling something which is BETTER than American Graffiti (for those who are +30!) but me being born in the summer of 1976 makes me somewhat proud that its set in the summer of '76 where wayward teens share a lil' about life, love, drinks, drugs and the most subtle jokes which you just can't stop cracking up over...watch this, and you'll see."
5,COOL....COOL....COOL....COOL,This movie rocks!! Its the last day of school in 1976 and a group of seniors and freshman set out into the night to have the time of their lives. From THE EMPORIUM to MOON TOWN this movie is full of fun and makes you wish you could have been part of it. Has a great cast and the soundtrack is excellent! This movie makes you wanna relax and chill out. This is one movie i'll never forget!!
5,Great,"Impressed with the very fast shipping , this is the best movie ever, brand new, I am a very happy customer and watched it at least a dozen times since getting it."
2,SMOKE ON THE WHAT?,"I empathize with Austin Texas below. While I was one of those kids who was stoned every single day of high school, I realize that most were not. The kegger scene was perfect, the shot of the 13yo purchasing booze at the liquor store was sadly right on, and depictions of the 30something drop-out hangers-on rang true. However, we did not gamble in the hallways, big stripped bell bottoms were long gone by then, and no one, absolutely no one, listened to Smoke on the Water in 1976! I don't know if I've heard it once snce 1973. And I hope I never hear it again. Whoever wrote this inconsistent tripe must've been dazed and confused when so doing."
2,Swing & miss,"When I watched Fast Times at Ridgemont High, I laughed because I saw characters I recognized from High School. When I watched this movie, I cried because it was written by one of those Prep-School creeps that only know about public school from what they saw through the windows of their sweet sixteen Beemer as they drove past.Not funny, not reminiscent, not worth the money of a disk to pirate it to. (And yes, in public school ""to pirate"" is a verb)."
1,"Widescreen Flashback Edition, huh??","The movie itself movie gets 10 stars!!!However, if there's no new anamorphic transfer on the new edition DVD, I'm not touch'in it. That's why I am currently giving the disc 1 star.Give me a new anamorphic transfer and yes, I WILL definitely replace my original copy."
4,Dazed and Confused indeed,"First time I saw this movie I was like ""wo"" then I was like ""WO"" and then I was like ""WOW"". I'm only 21 but I would of loved to live in those times (70's). Partying, drinking, smoking and having fun is what its all about. I still do all of that but it looks a lot cooler in those days cause everyone was doing it! This is one of the best movies to put you in the mood 8). This movie is a must, buy it!! You'll see many known actors of today in their early careers."
2,Any film that glamorizes bullying isn't a classic!,"This has to be one of the most overrated films from the 90s! While the movie is occasionally entertaining, the mediocre story, generic characters, and moronic behaviors takes away from the overall cinematic experience. I feel that there are better teen comedies about the 70s out there, such as Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Probably the best aspect of this movie is the soundtrack, but it is NO where near a classic movie that people claim it is. If you are curious about this one, I'd recommend you rent it before wasting your money on the dvd."
4,"Immature, but it's suppost to be.","Very well made movie that follows different groups of people on their last day of school. This movie is run by teen humor, but the characters and strength of plot over power the immature joking. Nicely done, but a little to long."
5,Very accurate portrayl of 70s teen life.,"I was blown away by the accurate portrayal of teen life inthe 70s show in ""Dazed And Confused."" I was only 11 in 1976 but the memories came flooding back when I saw this movie. Those were the ""big kids"" I used to want to be like back then. That was excellently portrayed by that Freshman guy in the movie. The music, the clothes, the partying...everything was exactly true to life. Mr. Linkletter hit a home run with this move.This is a must for any child of the 70s or anyone wanting to know what it was like!!"
4,THIS MOVIE ROCKS,"Bought this movie back in 95. Excellent music. I love movies to do with partying and rock 'n roll. What even made the movie better is the parts with Jason Lonldon. Wow, he's so hot. Been a huge fan of him for the past ten yrs. Even if you don't like Jeremy, you will still love this movie! LOL!"
5,A fascinating look back to Seventies High school life.,"A rich blend of charachters and a subtle array of humour makes this movie the cult classic it is. Pot smoking,football playing,beer drinking,women chasing,freshman licking seniors party away on their last day of high school. The fact this movie was set around only one day makes you feel part of the ongoings of the group. past-it hippie wooderson enthralls with 'out of it' one-liners,nice guy floyd and his confused circumstance interest, the women are hot and the partys are wild,man you'd be a fool to miss it."
2,WHY ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT THE 70S???,"I really get a kick out of most of these reviewers. They give this tripe 5 stars and say how much Dazed and Confused is a ""realistic account"" of the 70's. Then they state that they are still in high school.Dazed and Confused is NOT a realistic account of the 70s. The characters do not act or even look like anybody out of the 70s. They look like a bunch of mall-rats from the 90s. This movie is an insult to anyone who grew up in the 70s (like I did) Listen up kids- The 70s were not all that great. Find your own identity instead of conforming to what Hollywood says is cool. We were not all stoners that drove really hot cars as this movie would like you to believe."
2,"forgetable story, mediocre picture quality","I'd forgotten I had already seen this movie and it wasn't any more memorable the second time around. This is the typical teen coming of age movie with a bland cast and boring story. If I had remembered seeing it, not even the HD DVD release would have made me want to watch it again. The picture quality is only ok, probably among the worst for HD DVD. No even a rental to me."
1,Finally... The worst movie EVER,This is a total waste of time with no redeeming features.Could have just set up a camera in front of some lower middle class high-school on the last day of school of and come up with a move better than this.Don't waste your money on this like I did!!!!!!!
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With no plot to speak of, Dazed and Confused lives (and dies) on the charm and affability of its characters; it's not a terribly good film, but it is largely enjoyable and features some nice comic moments."
2,Dazed...,"Dazed and Confused Milla Jovovich fans be warned, she is listed in the credits, but only has about 2 lines of dialog and 37 seconds of screen time in the whole movie. I think her biggest line was ""Yes."" Her longest scene was about 10 seconds of looking at a lighter."
3,Fitting Title,"The title of this film is very fitting. Being 12 years old in 1976, I could vouch for the accuracy of this film in portraying 70s life (see ""Over the Age"" which was actually MADE in the 70s for another accurate look at teen life at the time). The lack of sensitivity of the kids' dealing with others, the pot-induced stream-of counscousness conversations (the rambling bit about Goerige Washington smoking pot, which was in fact a popular rumor of the time), the teen's abuse at the lax drinking laws of the era, etc. all ring true. However, there is no connecting plot or theme to this and you wonder what's the point of it all."
5,"STONED, DRUNK AND HAVING A HELL OF A TIME!!!!","This movie could possiblly be the best movie about high school life in the 70's I have ever seen. If you enjoy lots of excitement, teen age life, drugs, and nice cars, this is a movie that you must see. It is a movie you will watch over and over again just because you can't take it all in the first or second time. The movie is a teenage free for all, partying, and having a great time with out their parents knowing it. The characters themselves are great, Pink, Slater, the best, ""Are you cool man?"" This movies makes me wish that i could go back in time and go there, or atleast be IN the movie. They had to have a great time making this movie. I really think they should make a sequel to this. Bring all those people back. HEY LINKLATER! IF YOUR OUT THERE, GET THOSE GUYS BACK AND MAKE A SEQUEL!"
4,anyone from 18-35,"Most people under 40 should enjoy this movie. Sensationalized end of summer film that takes place in 70's Texas. Mary janes beers and Footbal, girls and a new freshman class to haze, what could be better!ben affleck is great! and parker posey is all star. Go SUNY-Purchase!"
1,It did not work.,It was shipped on time but once received I tried using it on several different DVD players without success. A message will appear that says please eject the disc.
5,Great Movie.... Have you seen it? You'd be a lot cooler if you did,This movie is just a comedy of the final day if school for some 8th graders and juniors in the 70's.
5,"""I just wanna keep livin'. L-I-V-I-N.""","I worship this movie. I don't think a movie could be made which would even compare to it. Telling the broad story of how high school students feel, while getting equally involved which each character really makes this movie unique and special. It's the essential guide to life. Watch it on a summer night, in the dark, with only the dim light of the street lamps sneaking through your window. It makes it 100 times better.Good things to do while watching this movie:Count how many times Mitch Kramer touches his nose in the nose-touching scene.Saying, ""look at the blood stains right there"" and ""Are you cool man... oooook!"" in time with slater.Singing to sweeeeeeeet emmmmmoooootions, slooow ride, freeeee ride.Count how many times ""Man"" is said.This movie is awesome."
5,The Greatest Movie!,"This is my all-time favorite movie. It is so wonderful. I would recommend it to any teen anywhere, you don't even have to have been a teen in the 70's to enjoy it. I mean, I am a teen now, and I love it. I have watched it countless times. In fact, I am about to order the two soundtracks from Amazon because I love them too. The movie is funny, interesting, and has a ton of great lines. ""Hey, hey, hey, watch tha leather man, a-ha-ha-ha"" ""dominant male monkey motha..."" Don't understand those quotes? You better go get the movie!"
5,Saweeeet movie!!,"In my opinion this was a totally fun movie to watch! I think this is more of a movie for people like myself. The joe-shmoe college student who looks for a good time. You WILL find a good time in this movie....it's awesome!! I have it on tape and I must have seen it 100+ times!! Dude, my dad even had a paddle from college like the ones in the movie!"
5,Very much so.,"Whoa, what can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. The first day I got the tape, I watched it 3 times(not consecutively) and I've watched it countless times since. All the characters are amazingly scripted, especially Ben Affleck as the villain of the movie, the character Slater perfectly depicts the stereotypical high-school pot head, with way too much knowledge about drug paraphanelia to be healthy. The plot is loose, but well held together. Wether your young and experiencing all the same themes for yourself, or your just an old timer trying to remember the good old days, this really is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) film ever made."
3,A typical teenage summer night in the '70s,Not much to this movie except as a reminder why so many late Baby Boomers became Helicopter Parents and Soccer Moms. Suburban middle age suburbanites watching every move their sons and daughters make and trying to schedule every free moment of their kid's time. I kind of feel sorry for the kids whose parents have a tight rein on them. This movie reminded me that we were just as bad as we think kids today are yet most of us turned out okay.
3,missing something but loved the product anyways,"the disks and booklet are in perfect condition, but it was missing the poster and the outside cover wasn't in the best of shape. Got here alot faster than I thought it would. Will most likely do buisness with this person again."
3,"Hey bud, did we get our wish granted?","""Flashback Edition"". I only pray that this means this is an ALL NEW edition of the DVD including deleted scenes, featurettes, audio commentary, and MORE! Until then, I'll give it 3 stars for cool cover art."
4,clear and concise,"This film has a great performance by Matthaew McConnaghey when he was a ggod young actor,before he became a hack leading man, and then rediscovered himself recently as a great character actor"
4,Creepy-accurate,"Richard Linklater meanders through the last day of school - actually the afternoon and night - in a smallish Texas town in 1976. I was in high school in a small town in Idaho at that time; a little less violent, a little less diverse, definitely more beer focused than pot focused - those pretty minor differences aside, this is kind of creepy-accurate."
5,Awesome,"It's just as funny as I remember it. It came quickly, and works perfectly. What more could you ask for?"
1,BORING!!!!!!!!,"I'm a big fan of the law school legends series, but this one was a real disappointment. talk about boring!!! i know that admin law is not exactly the most exciting subject, but listening to this guy ramble on and on was worse than listening to my own prof! i do not recommend!"
1,Click'n Design Beware,I bought this software as a download and didn't like it at all. Too clunky and unintuitive. Easier to use a drawing program and templates that come with all labels and can be downloaded for free. ...
4,Great labeling software!,"This software is the best out there. You can add pictures to your CD's, you can edit them, make 3d lettering in any angle you want, any color you want, style, etc. The only downside on this item is that it only works great on windows XP. If you have vista or windows 7 O.S. it may or may not work for some reason. I have 4 different comp. at home and it worked on a desktop with vista and on a desktop with xp, but it did not work on my lap tops that have vista and windows 7. I even took it to Best buy to have it instaled and it was not compatible. So if you have XP, you are good to go, if not then it is a 50/50 chance it may work, but if it does wk, I garantee you will love it."
1,Solow is out of time,"In his book Solow describes his growth-theory. But this theory already is out of time. It does not apply to many countries. Why not you might ask. Well first, Solow leaves a very important variable out, namely human capital. Second, Solow makes assumptions, which obviously will never hold, like an equal productionfunction for every country but also equal technological availability for each country. I do not have to explain why this will not hold for it speaks for itself. Many third-world countries have based their policies on Solow's growth-theory in the sixties, seventies and eigthies, but without any succes. It is time for these countries to change policies and to discover other growth and development strategies to catch-up with developed countries, specially with ecommerce comming up."
1,Not Made By Dyson,"Hopefully I can save you the mistake I made. This is not from Dyson, it is way stiffer and not well made. You can just go to Dyson's site and get a real one for about a dollar more plus reasonable shipping. I tried to save a few bucks but that was just not smart."
3,"Not bad, interesting imagining of napoleonic times","The story follows several soldiers in different parts of Napoleon's army. The story moves along well, the characters are sort of interesting and the blood and guts and brutality of war are well depicted. It isn't a literary masterpiece or anything."
3,"It's not ""Gates of Fire""","This book was recommended to me after I had read Steven Pressfield's two masterpieces, ""Gates of Fire"" and ""Tides of War."" While I found ""The Battle"" of interest, it falls well below the intensity I had anticipated. Although Rambaud interprets the historical facts accurately, the surrounding characterizations did not produce empathy save for LeJuene. There are smatterings of detail to describe the horrors of the battlefield, but they occur too intermittantly throughout the book and lack the continuity to bring them together as one vivid picture. I'd recommend this book for those who are unfamiliar with European warfare during the Napoleanic era. Don't be misled, however, it's not ""Gates of Fire."""
2,Yawn.....,"There is more to say about what is missing in this book than what is here. The Battle of Essling was a particularly bloody and brutal affair for such a short battle, however I felt the actual battle sequence was lacking emotion and detail. I give it two stars because of the historical accuracy and the effort. I couldn't wait to finish this book, however, not for the normal reasons."
3,CANDY MOLDS,"CUTE, DETAILED. BUT THEY BREAK EASILY AT THE NECK OF THE GUITAR SO YOU MUST TAKE THEM OUT CAREFULLY."
4,Something's in the water and it ain't a lady.,Another excellent score by James Newton Howard. Unfortunately this soundtrack is marred by some really terrible Bob Dylan covers. At least they put all of them at the end of the score and not broken up between the score cues.
2,ehh,I liked just two of the Dylan songs. The other two aren't so good and the rest of the music is uninspiring
5,A Whisper In The Noise,"Great to see the Minneapolis based, ""A Whisper In The Noise"" on this sound track (Times They Are A-Changin). The rest of their albums are wonderous and they are truly moving live."
4,"Haunting, Moving Soundtrack","If you loved the movie, you must own the soundtrack. There is a truth which moves in this music. The last three tracks, all vocals, should never have been added. Strictly throw away inserts. The CD is well worth owning for the first three quarters of the tracks."
5,Stunning.,"Simply stunning score. The theme is possibly the most moving track you will come across in years. You can not hear it through without your eyes watering and every inch of your skin turns to goose flesh. By far James Newton Howard's best score to date; although his score for Signs should be hard to top, he has done it."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!,The power went out on my deck and Samsung won't even sell the necessary parts to an authorized reseller. I called to tell them and they said I would be getting a call from a NJ office. That was 4 months ago. I have not been at all satisfied with their customer service at all!
4,"use with older televisions, and newer","The Samsung SV-5000 and SV-7000 use RF channel 14 and up (UHF band), as opposed to the usual Ch. 3 or Ch. 4, and this setting can be found within the user set-up menu via remote control."
2,Nobody does it better?,"Unfortunately, I'm afriad they do!What a wasted opportunity - Shirley's voice is great as always, though rather uncharacteristically subdued on this album.The biggest let down are the truly terrible arrangements. This should have been a classic album - and would have benefitted from full orchestrations - instead we get a synthesizer, which gives a very bad sound and ruins the whole thing.If I had to highlight any of the tracks they would be Thunderball, Live and let die and perhaps Moonraker - even though these are mediocre at best.We are all crying out for this album to be remade properly with Propellerheads or David Arnold - this version is sadly for die-hard Bassey fans only I'm sorry to say."
5,Shirley Bassey Sings Bond !,This CD is great ! If you like Shirley's voice you will like this.It is nice to hear her do themes that others did and put her own mark on them.My personal favorite is You Only Live Twice.Fans will enjoy this CD.
5,Awesome Egypt,"This is another Discovery Channel Classic!!! No expense was spared in assembling this great and cohesive product. Some of the greatest experts are featured along with one of the greatest modern discoveries in Ancient Egyptian Archeology. What is this great discovery. To find out simply loosen your ""purse strings."" A treasure at any price!"
3,WHAT A WASTE,FEATHERS FALL OFF. STRAPS ARE SO SMALL.HAD TO CUT STRAPS AND USE ELASTIC TO HOLD THEM UP.NOT A GOOD BUY.
1,Horrible Product,"This product is horrible, complete disappointment . It looked nothing like the picture and was complete garbage. One side had crappy feathers that easily fell off throughout the night, while the other side was just white cardboard. Complete waste of money, I recommend that no one buys this product, you will regret it. You are better off just making it on your own and spending less money."
4,Excellent Product,"I purchased this item for my 12 year olds halloween costume 2 days before she needed them. I chose 2 day shipping, and received them just in time for her to get ready. I searched in novelty stores and costume stores for the same type of wings, and the average cost I was looking at was around $45. I was happy to pay less then half that price with 2 day delivery! These are better quality than most, and they survived the entire night. If your looking for a decent looking angel wing than purchase these for a very low cost. Love them"
3,Not in Picture,My girlfriend had a hard time with it. it wouldnt stick because the strings were to loose. and the wings is not curvy in the top like pictured its actually flat on the top. and very small too.
3,Adult Feather wings,The product I received did was smaller than expected. The wings were not an angle as the picture depicts
1,Angel Wings,Not what I was expecting. It is to small for adults. Looks different in the picture. I will need biger wings.
3,"Small, easily breakable, but not bad","Ordered this for an angel costume for a Christmas play. It was relatively inexpensive, and I was pleased with it at first because it's made with real-looking feathers. A little small for an full-grown man (we had it on a 6' tall guy, so it looked a bit goofy... might look okay on a smaller adult), and it broke after two uses (the elastic that attaches the wings to the arms is a little flimsy). But it served its purpose."
1,bad product,This was a very bad product. It was a bunch of feathers that would not spread out. Also it looks nothing like the 1 in the picture.
3,NOT adult size,I liked the wings but they were smaller than what I thought. They also must be handled with care. They will serve the purpose for what I need but next time they will be used for children instead.
1,Nothing like the picture! Poor quality.,"The ""wing"" arrived in a nice box, very well packaged. Upon opening the box I found a wing. Maybe it was suppose to be considered the set, but to me it looked like only one. The product I received looked NOTHING like the picture. Flat, stiff and small and the feathers are falling out by handfuls. Very disappointed and would not recommend to anyone else to buy."
2,looks NOTHING like the picture,"It IS fuzzy on top, with a layer of feathers beneath, but does NOT have the heart shape at the top to make it look like 2 separate wings. It's just straight across the top. It doesn't look like wings!The straps, as everyone says, are way too big, and feel like stretched out elastic, but I knew that. No problem, except that they are attached at the TOP of the wings, which makes the wings hang halfway down the back, and reminds me of those cardboard sandwiches people wear on the streets of NYC for advertising purposes. The fact that these are not wing-shaped at the top just adds to that effect.I do have to say, I have not seen any feathers fall out yet, so 2 stars for that. She's 13, 5', about 97lbs, and they just about fit her. I can't see this fitting an adult.I can't blame the packaging, either, since the box it came in was an adequate size for shipping this, and the wings did not look squished or bent in any way."
5,Great Value For The Price,I ordered the wings to complete my angel costume. They look great and are very durable. They arrived on time and can't wait to use them for halloween. Would definately recommend buying these if you need white wings but have a budget.
2,Didn't look like picture.,"Bought these angel wings for a Halloween costume for my daughter. Long story short, I returned them because they couldn't even be worn. They were super stiff, and didn't have a curve at the top as the picture shows. The elastic bands on the wings were all the way on the sides of the wings making it virtually impossible to wear them over your shoulders as you should. Sent them back immediatley and got a refund. The only positive thing about these wings are that they were very pretty, and made of real feathers."
1,picture is very deceiving!,"I ordered this for my daughters costume.I should have returned it but it came in a few days before Halloween. The item sent does not look like the picture. 1 layer of feathers on a piece of cardboard, very cheap looking. I could have made this for half the price. wing span was to be 23"", the one i got was less than 20"". these wings would not look right on an adult. Elastic armbands were in the wrong place, had to cut them off and make my own. This item is definitely not worth the price!"
1,adult feather wings,This was the worse set of wings I have every had. They just hung on my back like a piece of cardboard and had no shape at all..I had to go buy another set of angel wings for my halloween party...But my dog enjoyed ripping it up...i was very disappointed in the wings..
3,Not that adult sized but stupid cute,"I got the wings for Valentines and trust me not adult sized, much smaller than the pic. It could be perfect for a child though. I only wore once. Maybe good for horse play but not with a costume in public."
1,Where is the rest of my purchase?,I only received half of my purchase and it's been over a week and I haven't received the rest. I'm not pleased at all and I'd like to know what I need to do to receive the other angel wing. I need this soon as I'm running a Valentine's Day race as cupid and one wing just won't do....
3,Love will never be simple,"This book is a good love drama it is mostly about a young man in love with someone that broke his heart trying to move on (something we can all relate to) I feel it. The book is very interesting and will keep your interest, my only complaint was the story was going back and forth regarding time frames. I do recommend this book, I think you will enjoy his point of view."
4,excellent first start,"Ever after explores the life of Nick, a 20 something african american young man full of dreams and hope. Nick is a hopeless romantic, vowing to be the perfect boyfriend, lover to the woman of his dreams until...Nick has life skills!!! he is educated, handsome but not cocky. He knows what he wants and won't settle for any else, and that just maybe his downfall. I really liked this book, the cast of supporting are great. they are distinctive and well written.great book to take to the beach"
5,A Must-Read,"'Politics in Taiwan' is an extraordinarily well researched, elegantly argued and very readable book. It concisely contends that Taiwan's 'democratic miracle' is a result of a long history of local elections that have taken place on the island, inculcating democratic skills and nurturing a viable opposition to the authoritarian regime. The book comprises an equal blend of theoretical reasoning and empirical richness. Professor Rigger nicely captures both the dynamics of historical development and the contingencies of real-life politics. A must-read for those interested in contemporary Taiwan and/or democratization, and very suitable for the college classroom."
3,difficult for beginners,"as a beginning guitarist, i found that this book wasn't nearly as easy to read as the other jeff buckley tab book ""Jeff Buckley: Grace & Other Songs"" (ISBN 0711977747). For example, each song should list ALL of the chords that are used in the song, not just some of them. Also, i found some of the fonts a little small and hard to read while playing. Perhaps a more advanced guitarist would have less trouble using this book.However, I still give it 3 stars because there aren't many Jeff Buckley guitar tabs, so something is definitely better than nothing!"
4,"A good start, or a good clarification","First off, in regards to another review: ""Hallelujah"" is probably not included because Jeff didn't write that song - Leonard Cohen did. As Jeff fans know, he enjoyed covering songs, and there were a few covers on the album ""Grace"".Second, most Jeff fans who play guitar have used OLGA or other sites to try to figure out the songs... and that may be enough for most of us. However, this sheet music is just what other fans have been waiting for - clarification of tabs, so we can attempt to get one step closer to capturing the magic of Jeff's music on our own instruments.If you're a big Jeff fan - whether a musician or a collector - this is a great addition to your library."
3,Fort Algiers,I enjoyed this movie suspense and drama I enjoy watching movies with Yvonne De Carlo Good Quality Black * White Film
1,Low budget. No story.,"The film is in black & white.A white-guy plays the Arab-sheik with tanning-makeup, breaking all realism. The producers did not care to hire an Arab to play the part.The low-budget-sets, lack of props, and lack of extra-people make you always aware you are on low-budget film-set, in a low-budget-film, and are not in Algeria; further breaking all realism.There is no story of interest, no humor, no cleverness, no suspense, no one you care about, no romance, no believable action, and only minimal suggestion of the foreign-legion. Anyone could have written this script, and done better.I recommend instead: ""Beau Geste"", ""Gunga Din"", or ""Wee Willie Winkie""."
1,TOTAL GARBAGE SOFTWARE!!! -5 stars from a EE,This is absolutely the worst POS software ever created. I tried this on 2 different state of the art computers and I still have yet to successfully create a simple audio CD. I honestly can't believe they have this on the market. By the way they give you 30 days free phone support if you call on your dime. I had to call them to get the software to install. The guy on the line tells me to just delete the problem file and it will work. I asked him if this started my 30 day free phone support.. he said yes... after that it would still not burn a cd. but makes a lot of frisbys... I put it on another older pent III 800 MHZ machine.. same error message when installing .. but I knew which file to delete to get it installed... still it would hang up for 10 min at a time... just unbelievable... DONT TOUCH THIS it is total GARBAGE!!!!! btw im an electrical engineer computer expert.
3,GREAT!,Although I liked this product im sure there are others out there that are better--for instance- Moviefactory works etc.
3,Green Pajamas - 'Seven Fathoms Down And Falling' (Rubric),"Not counting compilations and CD singles,this is the bands's 11th effort. I had no idea they'd existed that long of time. Green Pajamas plays decently penned neo-psych that's obviously been somewhat influenced by former Floyd guru Syd Barrett. Noticed some strong pop harmonies along with some nice fuzzy guitar work intact. Some of the better cuts are the dream-like ""My Visit With Magpie"", ""She's Still Bewitching Me"", the melodic ""Swans And Butterflies"" and ""Planet Love"". Line-up: Jeff Kelly-guitar&vocals, Joe Ross-bass&vocals, Eric Lichter-keyboard&vocals, Karl Wilhelm-drums and Laura Weller-guitar&vocals. Not a bad disc to pull out for a spin now and again."
1,Snippets,"Each song is about 4 to 16 bars long-not long enough to get dancing but just long enough to say ""oh, yeah, I know that one"". The snippets of each song are by the original artists. The songs are gathered into similarly-themed sets but the rhythm of each song within the set is uneven making it difficult to dance to with the music sounding choppy; like it was pieced together. I have other ""mix"" albums that aren't this bad. It would have been better if the producer had put fewer songs on the album and made the songs a little longer. For the price, I'd save the money and look elsewhere...."
1,"This Book is dated,","The best book out there is ""The Definitive Guide To Cancer"" by Alschuler and Gazella."
2,Informative but not particularly helpful,"Lots of information about managing life threatening diseases, and information about chemo agents, and about alternative medicines etc. Lots of repetitive warnings about not using any alternative medicines while in chemo. But nothing I found helpful in doing what the book claims -- combining traditional and alternative approaches. I can understand his concern about FDA and ethical issues re giving medical device, but this was a huge disappointment."
4,I like this series,"Another installment of Jaine Austen-- self employed writer / PI.Jaine is always meeting someone who wants to hire her-- the options appear to be endless. In this book, Jaine is resume writing and interviewing at a bank for newsletter editor.How many of you are like me? I skip the pages of emails from Jaine's mom and dad and enjoy the basic mystery story."
4,Real cute easy read,"I have always liked her mysteries. FUNNY and easy read. The only thing i did not like, was the ending was kinda abrupt and rushed.But over all it was great. I love her constant quips about food and her fat cat.hahha"
5,So funny!,I love Jaine Austen and her cat. She's a mellowed out version of Stephanie Plum but still has the same wit and charm. I've noticed that the author always thanks Joanne Fluke for all her help. I'm not sure why because Laura Levine is way funnier and a much better writer than Joanne. I'm waiting by my mailbox for her next book!
3,THE BRIDE SAYS NO,"FROM THE BACK COVER:BUT THE GROOM SAYS YESClementine Barlow felt horrible about handing Evan Tanner a ""Dear John"" letter from her sister. After all, it wasn't easy to deliver bad news to a man as cute as he was! And she saw potential in Evan that her sister sure didn't...It took Evan about five minutes to get over being dumped, but Clementine insisted he was wounded and needed her help. She kept saying something about women's magazine quizzes and his low scores in a certain area. Of course, if Evan wasn't such a gentlemanly cowboy, he'd take Miss Clementine to a soft spot on the hay and show her just how well he could score."
3,Great Fan Riding,"I gave it a three star because I thought the Video was too short (1HR) and it doesnt have much runbuys, just a couple of Metra trains and 1 three car Amtrak train that goes by in a few seconds. It almost seems as if they filmed it on a Sunday. I would've at least like to have seen an Amtrak superliner and some trackside footage. As a Northeast corridor Fan when i watch video cab rides of the NEC i can see and feel the history. Here on this video I only saw the history in the trackage, which was interesting to know. Not ever being in chicago it was nice to see how the route runs and arriving into the station, but also, Amtrak took alot of the track away because they were refurbishing it for upgrades possibly for faster service similiar to New Have, but you dont even see standby trains or any double crossovers going into the station. Over all its ok (3 star), but dont expect to see much action."
3,Pourcher - the priest who saved the beast,This book was written by Abbé Pierre Pourcher in !889. He had patiently collected together all available information on La Bete then printed snd published a 1040 page book on the subject himself.His book is without doubt the best and most comprehensive work on the subject. Without it the story of what is possibly theworld's greatest unsolved monster mystery would probably have been lost for ever. A great book and a great effort.The Beast of Gevaudan: La Bte du Gévaudan
2,UMM DISAPPOINTED,WELL ALL IN ALL THIS BOOK WAS NOT FOR ME. THE SUBJECT WAS SO SO. BUT WISH I WOULD OF READ REVIEWS ON THIS BOOK BEFORE I BOUGHT IT. I BOUGHT IN ON AN IMPULSE AND WELL WAS DISAPPOINTED.
5,Awesome,"I've been looking for this book for years but every time I would order it, it would no longer be in stock. I was finally able to own it & it was wonderful. It made me take a trip down memory lane to think about a guy I had a crush on but my fantasies weren't nearly as erotic."
2,Watch Ordinary People instead,"I can see where the filmmakers were coming from in making this film. This is yet another whitebread dysfunctional family drama about parents and children, a cross between Ordinary People, On Golden Pond and about a hundred other films. Yet I found this film to be extremely boring and mediocre, and I don't know if a really inferior screenplay is to blame for this. The key to a successful movie is good dialogue, and this film doesn't deliver on any level.. The actor who plays Taylor, Matt Nolan, is so wooden and contrived, it was almost embarassing to watch. He just seems to walk through his scenes, oblivous to the fact that he is actually in a movie."
3,samsung dvd-v2500 vcr/dvd,bought two units. one for my self and one for family member.when mp3s were played on both units they played at 4 times the normal speed.
1,Junk,"For this price or lower you can get Toshiba or JVC, which are better and have progressive scan. This one doesn't, and VCR can jam your tapes."
1,Dud,"The DVD player stopped working after 5 months with less than adverage use. I noticed another reviewer experienced the same problem. When you put a DVD in the player is says ""LOADING"" for a couple of minutes and then says ""NO DISC"". We probably have watched less then 20 DVD movies on it... Total drag."
2,Low on features and buggy,"I got this thinking I would save myself on some connections and components. Well, here is what has happened in less than a year of use (only played one VCR tape in it):1) LOTS of problems with the unit not ejecting DVD and CD's. Will just sit there and spin...and have waited for hours before trying to get it to eject. Sent it back to Samsung, and their comment (after I paid S&H) was ""couldn't reproduce problem"". GAHH!!!2) Poor options on CD/MP3 playback. There is absolutely NO random/shuffle option. On screen MP3 title selection is nice, though.Paid $250 for this one year ago.-Jeff"
4,Good book for the very young,The book is good for very young carvers. The pictures are great and the author does show everything. As a matter for discussion the author provides too much detail and if you need lots of detail then this book is what young starters can use effectively.
3,Hoped for more,"Although it does cover the subject and offer examples for inspiration, it does so in very broad strokes. I had hoped for mre istruction and less inspiration."
3,OK,"Some dark blurred pictures,but worth the price. It does give very good instructions on carving the spirits. It will be very useful."
4,just what I ordered,"Arrived as promised, well packet, loose, not in a box. Glad to find extra lids for my Corningware, since some of the pieces did not come with lids back when I bought them. Would like to find lids for the smaller pieces as well, both glass and plastic. I still have my original lids, so I expect these to last as well."
1,Not as Stated,"The title on this states ""Baker with Cover"", it is actually for the cover only! This is not evident and this should be removed from sale, or re-titled and re-described. It is misleading. Now I have a cover for nothig! Boo on you...."
2,Not Great,"The corner seams are visible where they were cut and bent together. Not high or substantial quality, just ok if you don't get to close to it."
1,cheap,Very cheaply made product. Its tiny and not high quality material. I returned this and bought something different for my purposes.
5,Very pretty! Great value!,"Nice quality, good price. Love the way it looks with my kiddos pics in it! Hard to find this size in stores."
5,Love Walked Among Us: Learning To Love Like Jesus,It arrived in a short time - in great condition - and is a very good book.Thanks
3,this is not the berzerker,"This album is from Generated X-ED. The Berzerker's 3rd album is coming out soon. Generated X-ED is allright, but the speed and strenght of The Berzerker's is amazing. Never seen a drummer that plays that fast, Gary you are awesome."
1,"Uhhhh,",".........this isn't very good. Actually, from what I've heard about how fast and heavy these guys were supposed to be, I'm disapointed. In the past few years I've bought and listened to a fair number of metal cds, and the only 2 that I wished I hadn't wasted my money on were this one and one by the Japanese black metal band Sigh. I will say this: The Berserker are not as bad them.Yeach."
1,As crappy as it gets...,"Wow, i remenber seeing ""the berzerker"" opened for ,syl,nile, and, napalmdeath...Boy, even a guy on the crow yelled at ""the berzerker"", this>( you suck!) that's how bad they were. I mean, i like alot of death/grind bands and even gore-grind but this stuff just does not cut it. For better bands in the likes ot the berzerker try ""sikfuk"" , ""bound &gagged"" , ""torture sever"" ,and, ""malignancy"" okay ? The berzeker's ""berzker"" is just plain horrible and they realy do suck. Don't waste your money!"
4,"Nice review, gobushgo","Did you read this book? I somehow doubt it, you ignoramus. Oh, and tripe is not an adjective. Did you mean ""trite""? As in ""we have been long subjected to trite phrases such as `left-wing media' from conservative brainwashers."""
2,Its ok,"I got this journal when I was expecting. I wanted a place to record all of my thoughts, and feelings and cravings during pregnancy. I wasn't all that happy with the layout of the book. I was hoping that after each week there would be a place for journaling but there are only notes for doctor visits or if you take a birthing class, which I didn't. I was also hoping there would be more places for ultrasound photos but I just ended putting most of mine in the pockets that the book provided since there were only about 2 spaces for ultrasounds and I have a few more than that.It was an ok book. I was able to record cravings and some thoughts but I wish the layout was a little better. I am thankful that I blogged during my pregnancy so I will probably just print out my blogs and scrapbook them eventually, when I have time."
5,I have loved this journal!!!,"I am now 36 weeks pregnant, and have written every week in the journal. The checklists help in making sure that we are prepared, especially since this is our first baby. I have personalized it to a degree by writing about what I feel like for that week (or anything exciting that happened) instead of only writing about certain subject headings. There are pockets in each trimester section to keep up ultrasound pictures. It has been so fun for my husband and me to go back and read week-by-week, and it is something we will keep with our little boy's baby book so he can read it one day!!!I'm buying this same journal for a friend who just found out she's pregnant!!!"
4,Nice Journal,"I like this journal because it is visually appealing and had a spot to write each week as well as a little bit of planning space without going overboard. Really, it's best if you can see the inside before you buy these things, so I looked at several at a local bookstore and then decided this one was the best combination of personal and planning writing space."
4,A nice record of your pregnancy,"I had this book with my first pregnancy and bought it again for my second. It has an area to write in each week of your pregnancy as well as places for names, notes, cards, showers, etc. It is not too much writing either but I was able to doument what each week was like and it has been fun to compare the pregnancies."
5,Love it!,"I love this journal. I got it while trying to conceive, and it has been nice to read through. I love that it doesn't have too much ""blank space"" for pictures I probably won't take (and if I did, I won't put them in my journal..). It is perfect for me because I am super organized and the categories will help me to keep track of everything I go through in pregnancy, but some people might not like to be so ""confined"". It is not for someone who just wants a lot of blank pages to write out their every thought, but I love this journal."
3,Overall a really good book with minor things that needs to be pointed out,"Reading this book really helped me understand what the Catechism is saying. It goes into good details about the Catholic teachings and used numerous quotes from Church Fathers. It is best to use the Douay-Rheims version (or KJV, unless the verse is coming from one of the Deuterocanonical books) of the Bible to understand where he is getting his verses from. The only down side is that it does a little bit of non-Catholic bashing."
1,Really tried to like this,"When I ordered this I wanted to give it as a gift, once I received it I read through the topics. Most were very negative types of questions about not trusting, jealousy, missed opportunities. From the reviews I had expected questions that would drive me down a positive path. I tried to think of someone to give to as a gift, but threw it away instead. If you are looking for a feel good type of journal this may not be for you. But on the other hand if you are looking for a journal to help you analyze the negatives in your life this may help."
5,Soul Catcher Kathy Eldon,"I have just started the book and it seems to have an interesting amount of questions and good content. I am in recovery so getting to know myself is one of the top pieces of work that I am doing right now. Kathy's questions really have me seeing and understanding things about myself that I never knew! I have been a fan of her son, Dan Eldon, since 1997. His book ""the Journey is the Destination"" is about his journals. I have been an avid art journaler ever since."
5,Soul Catcher,I love this book! It has been very helpful in getting in touch with my feelings. I highly recommend it to anyone. It's set up nicely with nice pictures and helpful inspirational writing.
4,If you are soul searching a must get,I like to write but never can keep up with a journal. This has helped me to work through some diffucult times and express them in writing format. If you need to soul search and work out some tough times in your life I recommend picking this up. It is worth the monet to have just for the help
4,"Finding Your ""Self""","This is a great book for those who love to write in a journal type forum and who wish that they could delve deeper into their psyche to further learn who they are and who they wish to be in this short lifetime. The book poses many questions to give the reader/writer an opportunity to look at themselves without fear and inhibition. The author's have also provided space to write your thoughts and feeling within the pages, as well as artwork that coincides with the different areas of ""self"" that are examined in this book. I highly recommend this book for those who feel that they need to re-examine who they are, or for those who may worry that they have lost important pieces of who they are and are trying to reclaim them."
3,"Great Photos, but not what I expected","If you are a Tennessee football fan, there are better books out there. While there are some great photos in this book, I was rather disapointed with it for the price."
5,Love this book,This is a very useful reference for anyone who wants to draw the head and hands accurately. It shows the differences between the male and female head as well as the differences of the head based on the subject's age. Excellent book from beginning to end.
3,Gift to Wife,My wife wanted to learn how to draw figures. Has many drawings in this hard back book. Show the basic shape of the head on page 21. Gives examples of babies; head in part 3 from page 91 to 101. Even has school children through teenager.The Anatomy of the hand section reminders of my days in college where we started figure drawing by doing contour sketches of our own hand without looking at the paper. Andrew Loomis sketches are good.
3,Drawing the head and hands,Not sure what I expected so my review will likely be of little value to most who read it. The art is interesting and dated as other reviewers have noted but for me that is not a bad thing. Had a similar book many years ago and bought this mostly for nostalgia. For that it serves its' purpose. Expectation is greater than realization and had I seen this on a shelf in a bookstore I would not have purchased it.
2,dated and out of touch,"some one is making money but not andrew loomis. these books came out in 1943. they are the property of the estate of... all the faces images are of that period. there being only one color of people in the usofa at the time, well as per these books. everything is so dated."
3,Good,"I thought the details stated that the book was new, but it was in a good condition, would order again."
1,Lid doesn't fit,I purchased this plastic lid to go with the oval CorningWare French White 2-1/2 quart dish but the plastic lid doesn't fit.
5,One of my favourite short-lived superhero shows!!!,"Well, after several delays & much anticipation, this has been finally released. This show was quickly cancelled when it was aired originally, but, can now be relived by all who appreciated it. Unfortunately, there is a small or major problem with the disc set!!! Someone believed that it would be feasible not to have any extras !!! For shame!!! I guess the materials were not available or in order to keep the cost low enough for buyers, they decided to forgo anything whatsoever. It would have been great to see & hear Carl Lumbly & Roger Dees recall their memories of this fantastic series!! If you enjoyed the series before, add it to your collection as soon as possible!!!"
2,Wow...they messed up Jaws this bad?,"For all my reviews visit my websiteI am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.This is the awfulness of Jaws 2, with none of the good, minus twenty minutes but what feels like hours upon hours. But, they at least gave it a shot. But, it felt like it was being directed by 12 year old girls. They had no idea what they were doing. What a piece of crap. There's absolutely nothing that will keep you awake. The only good thing was that they tried at making a movie, but they obviously had no intentions of trying to get someone as great as Spielberg because Universal was so d@m cheap with this movie! I don't wanna talk about it, and honestly, there is no reason to talk about it.The Rating? 1.8/5. Now that's crap. If they did that to a Jaws movie, I'm ready to leave my loyalty of Universal."
3,Sadly this is a box set,"I was very excited when I got an email from Amazon saying that a new addition to the Alice series was out. I jumped up and down and begged my big cousin to drive me to the store pronto to get it. It wasn't there so we ordered it off of amazon and I was SUPER dissapointed when I found out that this was a box set of books I had already. I am giving this box set 3 stars because I don't know what to put. If you have never read the first 4 books then by all means get this box set, but if you have already read them don't bother."
4,Perspectives,"This book has an impressive collection of accounts from various sources and manages to touch upon any significant Japanese American experience during World War II.I purchased this book for its coverage of the Nisei 100th and 442nd batalions, and was impressed at the varied perspectives included. From an excerpt from Daniel Inouye's account to a reflection by a concentration camp survivor liberated by men of the 442nd, Only What We Could Carry certainly covers the map.A good source for those studying any aspect of Japanese American life during the war, and an excellent one for those studying the subject in general."
4,What National Panic makes us think.,"Only what we could carry, edited by Lawson Fusao Inada, is a compilation of photography, drawings, poems, personal stories, legal documents, and memoirs of the Japanese Americans that were put into internment by the American government after the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor. Not only did this book include the interneesEexperience and their feelings, the interneesEAmerican friends and the media who were on the government side were included.Some of the interesting facts in this book were the propaganda images. One that really struck me as an interesting propaganda was titled, ""How to spot a Jap.E In a cartoon style, it mentions the differences between a Chinese and a Japanese. The drawings are put there so that it'll be easy for the public to differentiate them. I'm Japanese and I found this propaganda amusing. By just looking or reading the propaganda, it gives the reader the history and portrays how so many Americans were narrow minded and easily persuaded."
5,Great service!,"I appreciate great service provided by the seller! So professional, so quick! The purchased product Sony GV-D800 was actually a present to our family friend who retired recently and now has plenty of time to enjoy using it for his hobby. Everytime he tells me that the product is working excellent and truly a wonderful present!"
5,Great upgrade,"I bought a cheap thinline squire Tele. It played great and looked good, but sounded like crap. Since I liked the feel of it, I decided to buy it ($300.00) and save up for pickup upgrades. I saw these for $150.00 and bought them. 2 day shipping with prime, installed, and this cheap Tele sounds great! Has the nice tele ""pop"" in the middle position, very nice warmth on the neck pickup (I think it's warmer than a stock american), and the bridge pickup is pretty hot. Not as twangy as other teles, though, but ok with me. I prefer the percussive ""pop"" over the shrill twang. Very good buy."
5,My new favorite book. :-),"I just finished reading this book and I must say that I truly enjoyed it. I think it may be the longest one I've ever read and that initially made me nervous. But I had it done in just a few days; I couldn't put it down.Each character was described so vividly that you can't help but fall in love with each of them. I particularly loved Mary Rose. She had such likeable qualities and seemed like a real person to me. Her strength, kind heart, and gentle nature are to be admired. If she were real, I would loved to have met her.Now that I'm done reading it, I'm finding I really miss it. To me that's what determines a good book, one that sticks with you and that you can't forget."
4,all in all a great historical romance,"Another great historical romance for Julie Garwood. I like the fact that this book takes place in the west not in Europe like some of her other books. There's a lot of hot sex in this book, but not overdone and tacky. Be warened there are a lot of characters is this book but because the book Come the Spring continues the story I can now see why For the Roses was written the way it was."
4,Awesome,"I really loved this story. It had some of the hottest sex scenes too. I thought the Claybornes were absolutely hysterical. The story definitely held my interest, and while there were a few pages that were a little boring and unnecessary, I would absolutely recommend it. The boys cracked me up every time."
4,"Finally, a romantic western","Four orphans, pushed aside, forgotten, still retaining a kernel of human kindness despite the adversity thrown their way. Garwood writes a fascinating tale of these four that adopt each other, despite their differences, and save the life of an infant that would have otherwise perished. Garwood's tale is magnificent and the subsequent follow ups are enchanting."
5,One of my Favorite books,"I loved this book so much that I have read it twice. The other boks in the series, dont' even match up, and really are just too predictable."
2,Boring!,I usually love Julie Garwood's books but this one I'm having the hardest time finishing. It's just dragging on and on. I like it better when an author really focuses on the main characters story but this has all her brothers piping in and it just bugged me after about 50 pages.
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"I loved it so much! I just couldn't put it down. For the Roses is a classic novel. I have read it several times. All my friends have read it, and they love it too! I suggest reading For the Roses, alonf with all the sequals. (Red Rose, White Rose, and Pink Rose. Also Come the Spring) I have read every one!"
4,Love the Claybourn brothers.,I love the ongoing story of the brothers and their sister Mary Rose. The books are interesting and full of excitement and adventure.
4,For the Roses,"With a bit of England, a bit of the West and a bit of the harsh big city, this story brings together a lot of Garwood's best settings, and throws in the topics of slavery and prejudice as well. The four wonderful young men who became Mary Rose's brothers (Adam, Douglas, Cole and Travis) were courageous, honorable and each uniquely individual. Their interaction with Harrison was great and at times comedic. I loved Mary Rose. Even in the face of pressure, she never forgot who she really was and what was important to her. I loved that Harrison's devotion to her never wavered, he was truly a rock. I must say there were a lot of editorial errors in this edition. I look forward to reading about three of Mary Rose's four brothers in the next book in this series, The Clayborne Brides (a collection of three short stories)."
3,Too many grammatical errors,OK so I really enjoyed the book but found almost every page extremely frustrating due to grammatical errors. There were some words that weren't even words; for example laubie instead of laughable. Come on! I thought someone checked these things better than this! If you can over look all the errors then this is a great book!
1,"Started at 4stars, ended at 1 !!!","This book really had potential. All of the character descriptions and dialogue began well...then, it just fizzled. There were so many people ""talking"" at once, that it became had to follow the storyline. The book has a very creative premise, but I felt like the author was just rushing to fill pages toward the end."
4,Never quite reached its potential,"I felt like this was really building to something at which it never arrived. The characters were likeable, the romance something you can root for. But the conflict surrounding the heroine's family never took off and actually seemed like a distraction. All-in-all, a sweet love story that did not leave a lasting impression."
5,For the Roses is Garwood's Best Yet!,"Julie Garwood outdoes herself with this book!While reading it, I was totally immersed into theClayborne family and felt as if I was one of them.Wonderful characterizations, vivid mental scenery,and excellent spin-off material. Couldn't put this one down!"
5,HOW DOES SHE KEEP DOING IT!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the GREATEST books that I have ever read. The characters were wonderful. I especially loved the way Harrison was bemused by the arguing and yelling of Mary Rose's brothers at the table. What a GREAT family and a GREAT love story. I can not praise this book high enough. Please, if you haven't read it, go and get a copy. It is most DEFINATELY worth your money."
2,"Such wasted potential, not worth the time","I had high hopes for this movie. I thought as science fiction I would like it, and as a dog movie my sister would like it.The dog didn't even arrive until about two thirds of the way through the movie.The acting was sub-standard, the plot so slow as to be glacial. Even wanting to believe it was good, and having seen the five stars, I was so disappointed as the movie dragged on and on. I kept telling my sister, it's going to pick up, and then I told her again. Then I noticed her eyes were closed.Even the eventual action scenes were so dull as to be anti-climatic.I want my hour and a half back.And I lost some cred with my sister for making her sit through this. Oh I had some credits in that department because she made me watch the big lebowski, a movie neither of us could abide.There are so many good movies, I recommend you pass on this one."
3,Not for hanging on the wall,"I found this in a search for ""bushed silver 8x10 picture frame."" It is a very nice frame, but it is shiny silver.Also, it is only set up as a table top frame. There is no hook for hanging on the wall."
5,a laugh bonanza,This is a really funny and entertaining book. Give your friends the gift of laughter with a copy of Wishful Thinking. They will thank you for it. I am still smiling weeks after reading it.
1,EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO READ,"Bhagwati is an extremely intelligent man. He has a lot of interesting information to share with us. Now, only if he could write better...this book is extremely difficult to read and and to understand. It is NOT recommended for those without excellent understanding of economic trade policy. There are many other better written books."
4,Gadget Guy,"Light weight and easy to use. It does the job. Before you use it, you should study the mechanism and be sure the bolts are adjusted properly with enough tension to hold the blade securely, but still allow for full return on the spring tension.If you misuse it and exceed limits, the bolts will break, preventing dammage to the mechanism. You can get replacement bolts at Ace or any hardware store."
1,TRIVET,"TRIVET GOOD, BUT NO BETTER THAN THE ONES I GOT AT THE DOLLAR STORE! I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE I COULDN'T FIND PURPLE. NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
2,bewildered,"I thought I'd take a chance on this one after reading the positive reviews. I'm rarely led astray by following my insticts, and love discovering new artists after reading about them. Plus, Sally Timms and John Langford from the Mekons are guests on this album, so it seemed like a safe bet. It wasn't. I think this will be my one and only Johnny Dowd purchase. Biggest reason: I just can't get past that voice. Johnny Dowd is not a singer, yet he inflicts his harsh vocals on the listener. I can handle a little eccentricity, but this guy just makes me squirm. It's okay to be ""an American original"" but it helps if you have some talent. Lyrically, he's got something to say on a few tunes, although some of the simplistic lyrics in other songs make me wince. The parts I enjoyed best were the instrumental passages. Some cool guitar and organ interplay at work. But otherwise ... ouch. This is painful to listen to."
5,The best green chai,"I've tried every green chai available and this is hands down my favorite. The dominant spice is ginger and the aromas during steeping are incredible.Unlike many green teas, you can brew this for an extended time (i.e. when you forget about it) and it still doesn't get bitter. I take mine with a little sweetener and some cream.Excellent tea and it can't hurt that it is organic. Enjoy!"
1,Really inconvenient,"I received an Installcard with a car sterio my girlfriend bought me as a present. I requested a installation at a convenient time for me within a few days on their website. I received a install date confirmation after my requested date, so I declined. It then became impossible to use the website. When I called the company to set up an installation I was informed that I could not do so. I have to wait for a call that will come sometime in the next couple of days. I pleaded for a number to call so I could just schedule a stupid radio installation, but the operator on the other end was adamant. I'm a busy person, and jumping through these hoops wastes way too much of my time. I have my credit card ready and willing to pay them to install this radio, but they insist on giving me the runaround. It boggles the mind. My advice is to spend the extra few bucks and just pay somebody to install your equipment and stay clear of this."
1,dont buy installer net card,this is a rip off installernet takes %40 of the money and the good installers will charge you extra because installernet wont pay them! save your money and find a local installer they will no it for the same amount you pay installernet most of the time
3,CHEAPER to Deal DIRECTLY with INSTALLER,"I paid $63.00 for a Basic car stereo Install only to go to the Installer and get charged another $62.?? in fees. I basically paid $125.00 in istallation services since I was still charged more at the Installation place. Yes, I know my vehicle needs specific harness, bracket, etc. but, $125.00 install fee's just to INSTALL a simple car deck. As a matter of fact, the fee's were more than the stereo itself!!!The Installer (at CAR TOYS) told me if I went straight through them I would have been charged $40. for basic install PLUS $62.00 for the brackets, harness, etc. SOUNDS Like I could have SAVED $20. + DEALING DIRECTLY WITH THEM!!!! (Hmmm, what can I do with that extra $20??? ALOT!!!)Overall, I SUGGEST you deal straight with the Installers MINUS the E-Card... (unless you want to pay more)....It's fairly EASY to go to Car Toys, Best Buy, etc. and deal DIRECTLY with them. I KNOW I WILL DO THAT THE NEXT TIME I NEED INSTALLATION SERVICES..."
1,A COMPLETE RIPOFF,Bought a dual rearseat dvd player for my specific make model vehicle. Bought the install card for $189 from the dvd company at the same time at checkout and thought that would be it. Called the installer I got through installcard and he said his rates are $60/hr. and if he went over how much I had on the installcard than I would be responsible for the difference. Of course if he went under I wouldn't be refunded any though. Called installcard and they said take they couldn't help me. If you buy this ripoff card all you are doing is setting the minimum price for your install when no guarantee it won't go over. Do yourself a favor and run like crazy from this company.
5,Very Happy,"The installers this card sent me too were really friendly, professional and nice to an aging auntie. I really appreciated there good natures and quickness."
5,"awesomes, works perfectly, frees up the tank to lean on.....","this is great, its like luggage made for the bike, because of the easy to use built in straps, it sits on my little crotch rocket passenger seat, and stays firmly, an awesome brief case for work, as big as a back pack, but looks better.... on and off in 5 seconds.... great !"
3,I wish I did not buy them,"Very heavy, and very uncomfortable. I can not have them on my head for longer than 15 minutes at a time. They sound very good, although a bit muddy when played louder. Bad ergo design makes good points vanish after only few songs, and all that is left is a headache. Buy a good soft hat if you buy these headphones.- sg"
2,Decent...but not exceptional,"Even though the sound quality is great, the comfort outweighs it alot. I didn't like how the cushions were too small. They overlapped my ears making it hard to listen for long hours. Another thing that I didn't like was how hot it was. Granted, most closed headphones have that problem, but this one seemed more apparent, maybe it was just me. However, I did enjoy having that coil cord. It made my music more portable. But in the end, I just didn't like the comfort. Also, I had trouble with my return, but that wasn't the headphones fault. In the end, its price is decent for the sound quality, but the comfort was annoying."
3,"great sound, but...ouch!","Incredible sound, incredibly portable - but after 30-45 minutes of use (say, in front of computer watching a dvd, or on the plane with your ipod) my head & ears start to ache. Subtle, numbing sensation creeps up until I can't stand it any more and have to take them off.Great sound & ez portability doesn't overcome the comfort issue and I'm selling. Maybe your head is shaped sufficiently different from mine? Hope so, 'cause these phones are excellent otherwise."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!,This is a horrible iron... I bought it mainly because of the retractable cord (which doesn't even retract all the way) and as someone else mentioned it leaks water ALL over any garment you try to iron. I received it this afternoon and it is in the box and ready to return.
2,Not Happy,I want to return this iron. The water leaks on your clothes as you iron.I must say I do like the retractable cord but not enough to keep the iron.
4,"Maybe not blooming, but definitely budding","It's a fun read, and brings an element of wry humor and chatty ""chick-lit"" voice to Asian American literature. The main character, Ginger, is a 20-something, Manhattan, fashion-mag employee, this book adds more complexity to the Sex/Shopaholic/Bridget genre in touching on greater issues of race and sexual orientation. Yes, the materially driven real estate agent Korean mom treads a bit close to a trite Dragon Lady stereotype, and Ginger herself tends to follow the opposite Asian stereotype of indecisive, naive, self-loathing Asian American ... Lee does create sympathy for many of the characters in the novel. The ticking-clock situation is kind of Edith Wharton-esque (Marry NOW, to the best prospect you can find) ... not the most politically correct, but fiction, even hyphenated ethnic fiction, should not be just about advancing political causes."
2,trite but entertaining at times...,"I give credit to the author for her writing skills; however, did not like the theme and message that was given through Ginger Lee. The author and this character resembles what we know as a Korean sell-out. I was disappointed at the stereotypes, superficiality, and assumptions made by Hwang. I too am Korean-American like Hwang, but believe that her personal experiences were not inidicative of all Korean-Americans. It is her book and it is her story...so be it. To each his (her) own...I will not write that anyone should go out and buy this book and I will not write that you should stay away from it. This is just my personal opinion after having read it."
3,Indications of an amateur.,"Yet another coming-of-age novel by an Asian American writer of mediocre talent. The premise of the story is hardly unique; in fact it falls not far at all from Amy Tan. Hwang does skate on a few sociopolitical issues but fails to go beyond the events to show readers the significance of said events. I will however credit her for springing the characters to life. They leap off the page and some of the dialogue is pretty quirky, though Hwang seems to realize this herself and relies heavily on dialogue to propel the story--indications of an amateur."
3,a mixed review,"There were parts of this book that I liked and times when I rooted for the heroine, Ginger, but other times when the story seemed a bit cliche and dragged...The book deals with a mother-daughter relationship from a Korean protagonist's viewpoint. The protagonist's mother is on a mission to find her daughter a suitable Korean husband. The theme seemed a little trite but if that is the subject matter, so be it. I liked the depiction of the fashion magazine that Ginger works at, Ginger's insights and musings about her cultural identity and the struggles to define one's self, and the way the characters are fully drawn out--I could visualize them in real life. I also liked how Ginger had heroic moments of standing up for herself and standing her ground. It was a pretty good read..."
2,Not well written,Don't waste your money.I didn't think this book was well written. I could not finish it and gave it away.
3,HO HUM,Although the story tries to be interesting the sex scenes actually over shadow the story. The characters are not that well developed and even though the sex scenes are steamy after awhile they get boring and repititious. If you are looking for a book with a solid plot this is not the book for you.
1,Non-existent customer service,"It was amazing to find out that the customer service for this product does not exist. I tried calling them 4 times, and could not get anyone on the phone.Therefore, I could not buy the software without any detailed info. on the available features. I wanted to find out if I could rotate the images. I still don't know the answer and finally bought another product."
5,"Finally, Ulead gets it right!!!","Having pulled out most of my remaining hair on previous versions,(and putting it in the closet for 2 years) I bit the bullet and downloaded Video Studio 6 on the chance that it was better.Well, it is fantastic. I have a Sony DV camera and this program has everything that was missing in previous versions. It even has the VCD burner included. This program does it ALL. Capture,Edit,Burn. Lots of great features, very user friendly.In 2 days I was able to create 3 projects without any problems. Im not a pro by any means, and most pros have given this product a lower rating than most. BUT, if you are looking for an inexpensive way to convert tapes to vcd (or DVD with a DVD burner) this is the best for the money."
3,Unstable...,"I own this for a long time now.I have never been able to trust this software to do the timeconsuming job overnight. i.e. I capture all the stuff I want and then set it to generate the MPEG2 file (DVD qualtiy) and when I check in the morning. My system is found frozen or the program has exitted with no error message, absolutely leaves no trace of what happened.The customer support is non existent. I tried reaching the customer support by submitting the form on thier site several times but each and every time I got the fixed, useless, automated message reply.I would not recommend this unless you do not mind the unstable software, and on tight budget.I bought this as it is [less money] compared to other and only for home use. Has good features that I have never used as the basic functionality itself is unstable."
1,Civil War for dummies?,"Or maybe for people with attention spans similar to goldfish. Awful, tidbit-sized offerings that may or may not be true. You'll learn nothing of the significance of the Civil War from this offering."
1,The cover art is not reflective of the playing style .................,"I've had this cd a long time but I never play it, so I thought I'd find out why. Katie is a very capable player, but she has an addiction to drama in her playing that keeps me on edge when I listen. That other people say her playing is soothing and relaxing totally mystifies me. This cd is in no way soothing or relaxing. It makes me feel the same as when I've had too much coffee.Listen to the samples at allmusic.com for your free shot of aural caffeine."
3,Good unit way overpriced,even though i found a good deal on this it's still duplicated at almost the same quality just by playing thru the camera.
4,A Good Book....,"This book seems unique. It tells how to put on make-up in a fun, glamorous way. I consider this to be an intermediate level book on makeup. It's good, but I wish there had been some more pictures on the makeup application sections. There were a lot of tips on health and beauty that I haven't seen in other books. For a beginner who wants to learn the basics of applying makeup, I would recommend Bobby Brown or Sonia Kashuk (their books are better illustrated and explained). But if you want to learn how to look good when going out to a nightclub, or want that ""Vogue"" type of look, I would recommend this book."
3,Not Too Bad,"Overall this book offers a lot of useful information. What I like about it is that Cohen has provided advice from many different sources. There is a variety of product suggestions; it doesn't seem like someone trying to sell you on their products alone.I did however find a few contradictions in the book. For example, on one page it will suggest a woman at a certain age refrain from using glitter eyeshadows, and then two pages later, it says to use shimmer for mature lids. Might be kind of confusing for someone who is not familiar with eyeshadow textures.Another thing I think was kind of bad was when she described someone with a oblong face shape as having a ""horse face"". When you are writing a book to help people improve their look, and use a negative term to describe a body part, it kind of defeats the purpose. Anyone who works with the public within the beauty industry knows that-or I hope they do!As with any beauty book, take it with a grain of salt and use what works for you."
4,It`s ok.,"This book is great for a beginner. While reading I found a lot of tips I already knew, and it made me feel good that I was doing my make up right as this was my first makeup book). Maybe 5-10% was a new stuff for me, plus they mention some products I would like to try (with very good reviews online). There`s a lack of images that would show a different techniques and before and after photos. Reading a page how to get a desired look was quite boring. But I guess might be helpful if I would like to achieve a desired make up thanks to those step by step instructions. The only annoying thing was repeating of some tips for 2-3 times, plus a few contradictions mentioned in the other review. I would be happy with this book, but then I got ""Making faces"" and it`s way more fun to read."
2,Narration Sucks,The trains are good but he sucks with the camera and the narraton. BUY PENTREX programs and youll be impressed!!
1,Garmin Magnetic Antenna,It did not work when I first used it. E-mailed Garmin they have since shipped me a new one waiting for it to arrive. So cheap made they told me to throw the bad antenna away when the new one arrives.
3,"product good, customer sevice baaad!",I have no issues with the product itself (once it got here).I tried to contact the seller (ace hardware outlet(through Amazon)) after not having received my order a week after it's estimated arrival date. I still have not heard back from them...I will not be making any purchases from ace hardware outlet again!
2,Not So Good....,"I started reading this book last week and I couldn't get past chapter 8, if I got that far. The book was all over the place and hard to follow. I bought the book because of the great reviews it received from other readers. Maybe I will pick it back up again when I have nothing else to do on a Sunday afternoon....."
3,Cadfael,"-Derek Jacobi takes the lead in the role of Brother Cadfael. In the Cadfael box set, four television episodes are soundtrack recorded with a narrator. Vocally, these four stories are wonderful pieces of fiction. However, even with a narrator, it sounds as if we are missing something. The production values are excellent, since these are the Brother Cadfael TV series which ran on PBS . . . But on audio, it sounds hollow . . ."
1,Kitman is a poor researcher !,"Poorly researched, misleading and out of context. Are we really to believe that George Washington was the leader of our army with the goal making money on his expense account? Please folks, read some real books about what this man went through and the true miracle he pulled off. Kitman is a very poor historian and should not present himself as one."
3,Key can be a choking hazard,"My 2 year old just got this for Christmas and I was suprised at the size of the key....a definate choking hazard for kids under 3 who put everything in their mouths--which is why I only rated the toy 3 stars. I called Fisher Price, and they didn't seem too concerned, just offered my money back. I didn't want the money, I just want to make sure nobody chokes. So my son plays with it without the key. It snaps shut okay without it. He has a ball and is such a big Blue fan, it's great. He plays with it at the table while I cook dinner and it keeps him entertained."
4,Ritual - Good Swedish Prog,"Ritual is another Swedish progressive rock band like the Flower Kings, Anglaagard, and Anekdoten that have found their own niche. Unlike the previous three who can attribute more of their style to King Crimson, these guys are closer to Jethro Tull and Gentle Giant but have managed to be extremely unique in the process. Grunging guitars, intricate keyboard work and strong irreverent melodies make up their music which is a bit hard to describe. A must have for the prog rock fan."
5,The book contains good early Snyder poems and fine translati,"This book passes the test of time because of its taut poetry and insight into the link between Sndyer's environment in the Pacific Northwest and his inner landscape. The second part of the book is priceless. Snyder's Zen practice and skill as a writer and linguist make him eminently qualified to translate the words of the reclusive poet Han-Shan, whose poems ring true today. I have read other translations of Han-Shan but Snyder's is the best. Its paradoxes move us in our modern times just as they must have in early China."
4,Life in the French Foreign Legion,"Life in the French Foreign Legion is a very good account of a phenomenon that has traditionally been cloaked in a veil of mystery and, to some, even romance. Evan McGorman writes in an entertaining and honest manner about life in the legion as he personally has experienced it. His goal is to inform others who consider enlisting and in this he succeeds admirably. For those who are not inclined to enlisting, the general public, Evan's writing is interesting in broadening one's horizon regarding a part of military life about which heretofore very little was known. His writing style is entertaining and easy to follow. It is a worthwhile read which is hard to put down once started.Herm ZandmanBlood, Sweat and Gears"
3,Only read if you want to join the Legion,The legion is crazy. I purchased this when I was about to join. The book surprisingly made me want to join more. Thankfully it never happened but this book would have done a very good job preparing me.
4,It's still French!,Anyone interested in a military stint would best look elsewhere than the Legion Estranger. Elite formations of the U.S. have better equipment-training and off-duty diversions than the Legion. If you want to learn to speak French buy a language course on DVD!
3,"Good, but...","I love this version as I feel it stays as close to King James as possible but without all the ""thees"" and ""thous"". I appreciate the commentary as not being doctrinal, but, it also prevents the comments from committing to a thought. As a result, many (if not most) footnotes are simply reiteration of the text. I think there might still be some room for footnotes to be more decisive and opiniated but without pushing a particular doctrine or denominational thinking."
5,"""What a wonderful gift""","I got this Bible for my Daughter , because she asked for one. This bible is so convient in size, she carries it in her purse and reads it everyday! I plan to order two more., one for my son and one for my other daughter. ""What a wonderful gift"""
1,Do not buy it from Amazon.com !,"When i bought this item,estimated shipping time was 10-12 days. However, amazon changed the date several times at the date when they were supposed ship. They made me wait four months and at the end they've sent an e-mail saying that they can't obtain this item and they've cancelled my order. It was that easy for them ! Even now, despite that the book is unavailable, they listed the book as avaialbale in 2-3 weeks! Never buy this book from Amazon.com. I am planning to buy it from ecampus.com."
1,poor packaging,This heavy coffee table book was packed in one layer of plastic bag. The binding was broken and dust jacket was ruined in shipping. I asked for a refund but was offered another book. The second one came in the same one layer of plastic packaging with no dust jacket but the binding was in one piece. I would not order from this shipper again.
4,Intrigue at its best,"Isser Harel was the head of the Israeli Mossad when they conducted a very intricately planned kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann. He wrote this account of the details of the operation, conducted in and around Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1960. I liked the book very much. It very much gave me a sense of place and is a gripping story of a long and well-planned operation that brought the Nazi war criminal back to Israel for trial, and, ultimately, execution. A true story and a gripper!"
5,A must have for nail artists,"Got this for my teenage daughter who is constantly trying different designs on her nails. A must have the person who wants a clean, polished look on their fingers."
1,useless,"To me, this was quite useless, I mean, when I put on nailpolish i'd rather fix it with a cotton bud than waste my money on something like this, it's just not necessary."
5,Wow.,"Okay, I admit, this book was sitting on my nightstand for a while. I had no interest in reading it because it took place in a different time zone with no Morgan or Hunter.Well, turns out this book was absolutly amazing. It goes back to the orgins of the dark wave, and when Rose is performing it, you feel like you're in the book. It's so intense. When she cant get Diarmuid (or however the heck you spell his name) back, you want to reach out and help her.Sorry if this review is a bit off, it's been a while since I read it."
3,sweep series,Although I love this series this was my least favorite in the set I think. It doesn't involve the main characters much though it does explain a lot about how the evil witches come to be and where the dark wave comes from exactly!
3,Not one of the better books,"I have been slightly dissapointed with the last few books in this series. I don't know if Cate is running out of ideas or she actually thinks by adding other characters pov's the readers will enjoy it.This book has only two chapters from Morgan's pov. It was slow moving, but still informative. It explains the background of the darkwave.Is it worth the read? Yes, if you don't mind the change of character. I prefer Morgan though."
4,Mixed Feelings...,"I have mixed feelings about this series, but I'd say that overall I enjoy it. This book in particular, I thought was well strung together and Cate Tiernan seems to have a thorough knowledge of Wiccan history! When I first found out that the whole book was a diary of a totally different witch I thought ""oh crap, how am I meant to get throgh this boring part?"" but it proved me wrong. At times , though, I desperately wanted to scream at the characters and shake some sense into them - but that's a good thing right? Because it shows the reader is interacting with the characters.The ending, I thought, was very gripping and left me in a bit of a daze - and still reading at 2am!This series and changed my view on a lot of things, including my views on nature and the spiritual side... if one exists...?"
4,Sweep #10,"I loved it! But I liked Morgon better so i gave it 4 stars. If you want to get into Hunters head this is the way. Its really good, i couldn't stop reading it. and i'm not even wiccan. (or whatever you call it :))"
2,not the best book in the series,"I love the sweep series and couldn't wait for this book to come out, but when I got it I was a little dissapointed because this book has very little to do with Hunter or Morgan, all it does is tell about Rose McEwan and how she started the black wave. personally I think if my boyfriend just came home from a few weeks in canada I would want to do something other than say hello and then read a diary of my ancestor. I liked the earlier books when all the focused on Morgan and her coven a lot more than the books 10 and 11."
4,Now I understand what happened to Netscape!,"I found their description of the evolving routines at Netscape (and Microsoft) amazingly complete for researchers who had to do the job ""after the fact."" Indeed, it reads like an ethnography, which I think is the highest compliment I can pay a book that depended on interviews with key participants, rather than actually sitting in on meetings. They really captured the tension, ambiguity, and uncertainty involved in a high growth start up.The book fits very well with an evolutionary view of how routines & bundles of routines develop within organizations. I recommend it to people interested in evolutionary theory.The authors supply a cold dose of reality for anyone who thinks that managing a knowledge intensive high growth start is easy!"
4,entertaining insight to the browser wars,This book gives a good insight on the web browser wars. As times are changing towards global economy and eCommerce corporate strategies for winning the mindshare and marketshare is also changing. This is a good book to learn from the success and mistakes of Netscape and Microsoft. If you are planning to put together a eCommerce strategy for your company you can learn a lot from here
4,Great Business Read Without Putting you to Sleep,"This is one of the best business books I have ever come across. The authors do a great job presenting the redical shift in business strategy made necessary by the speed of the information economy. The book is well researched and strikes a nice balance between being practical vs. academic. My only complaints are that the authors tend to repeat themselves and that the cover is misleading in that the book is basically a case study of Netscape's business strategy, and provides very few revelations regarding it's duals with Microsoft."
4,Focus and Execution (not!),"These two business school professors (...) interviewed many people at Netscape and elsewhere. Though the conclusions do not come through as strongly in the book as they might, we learn that Netscape made three major mistakes: 1) it did not focus and execute on a long-term strategy, 2) it's software engineering practices were not as good as Microsoft's, and 3) it's software engineers were not as talented as Microsoft's. The biggest mistake was Netscape kept changing its mind about what business it was in. As a result, it was not able to execute hard enough and long enough to win.Focus and Execution are key element of any business success!"
4,Best for students of software development,"Short on story, long on the nitty-gritty of software development, this book is interesting if you want to figure out how to do software. For a good story, go elsewhere."
2,nice history but questionable premise,"I think that the book provides some nice history and 'insider information' on the startup of Netscape and the creation of its products. I find the premise that EVERYTHING that they did was in reaction to Micros~1 is rather dubious. The authors overuse of the cliche ""...in a life and death struggle with Microsoft"" is annoying. The fact is that Microsoft is irrelevant to innovation, the creation of the web browser, and the internet itself. What they are about is using their monopolistic/anti-competative practices to destroy real innovation.This book would have been worlds better if it focused more on Netscape and the development of its products (more like Tracey Kidder's ""The Soul of a New Machine"" (an excellent book BTW) and less on playing up the melodrama of its interactions with Monoposoft."
3,Dull,"Probably fine as a business tome, but as an entertaining read, I found this a failure. I hardly got through the first few pages; the books starts with a long, obvious and patronising exposition about how internet has transformed our lives and what a revolution it's been. It reminded me a lot of ""The Road Ahead"" by Bill Gates.Microsoft has been commercially successful, but at the cost of integrity. It has none whatsoever. This may indeed be Microsoft's downfall in the end, because the hatred towards this company is reaching a fever pitch. More and more users will realise that they can get by using other operating systems and products, supported by companies who have a less selfish vision for the future of computing."
4,Eye Gel,Seems to work just as advertised. I like it and would recommend it. Read about it in a news article.
3,Nietzsche.,"When this novel was published before World War II, it was immediately recognized as an attack on Hitler and the Nazi party. This was rightly so. But is Jünger's solution better?The clash depicted in this novel goes between the masters (the free) and the servants (the slaves).Jünger sides naturally with the masters (I prefer to die alone on the battlefield, than to vanquish with the servants).The servants are the nazis with their chief lumberjack Hitler, who try to impose their slave mentality on everybody.Jünger is a great admirer of wars. Why? Because in these dangerous circumstances the real masters, the real free can prove unmistakably who they are: courageous, natural leaders, morally and physically free men.Jünger is a formidable writer. His prose is breathtaking radiant, written with a stunning virtuosity (e.g. the attack of the bloodhounds), with amazing evocations of battle scenes.But for me, his message is fundamentally wrong: he sets war above peace."
1,Kindle version NOT the Maguire translation,"I found ""Dead Souls"" through the Amazon search and clicked on the hardbound Maguire translation. The 6 customer reviews extoled the Maguire version as one of the better ones. The webpage also mentioned a Kindle version and included a link. I clicked the link. The same customer reviews appeared as for the hardbound version. There was no contradicting information about the translator, so I bought expecting the Kindle version of the Maguire translations. When I opened the Kindle version, I was surprised to see credits for translation by D.J. Hogarth. This difference should be made clear, especially when the reviews on the same page extol the Maguire version and you don't get that translation."
1,Kindle version incomplete!,"i bought this for my Kindle in April, 2009. Unfortunately, this version is incomplete - the electronic version ends abruptly about 1/3 of the way through. I followed up with Kindle Support. They encountered the same problem."
1,Broke after being used only 3 times!,"After only three uses, one of the blades broke when we were slicing a mushroom. We only used it for slicing strawberries and mushrooms."
4,My introduction to Harlan Ellison has we thirsty for more Strange Wine,"I have not read any of Harlan Ellison's other books but after enjoying this collection of short stories I will be reading more of his work. His style is very easy to read without feeling dumb or pandering. Some of his subject matter is a bit taboo (abortion, womanizing, etc) but he handles taboo and nontaboo with grace and dignity."
4,"RICH WITH PLUM, PEACH, AND MUSK","What first catches your eye is the bottle - it's a stunner. Wide and then tapered it is topped by an imaginative ruby tone shape - a pout, a kiss, a heart? All of these signify romance, which is most definitely appropriate for this subtly sensuous fragrance.Princess Marcella Borghese launched this scent in 1993 and like all classics it has withstood the test of time. Its floral fragrance is as fresh today as it was when introduced. A very feminine scent it has additional notes of fruit - plum, peach, plus musk and cedarwood.I never tire of Il Bacio - summer, winter, springtime or fall."
5,To Good for Words,I wore this scent several years ago and I have been searching for it every since. This fragance is breathtaking everywhere I go people ask what I'm wearing. I love it so much I purchased to bottles and the shipping service was supper fast. I Love Amazon anything I think I want I'm able to find it here.
2,Perfume was horrible but Amazon made it right!,"I have worn this perfume for years and have ordered is several times on Amazon. The bottle I received was very foul smelling and not what I ordered. I advised Amazon of this and per their procedure you cannot send the item back but they still refunded me the money, a stand up thing to do. I will continue to order from Amazon just not this perfume."
1,Rip-off,"I ordered this perfume for my grandmother, and of course, the spray does not work, and the item is not refundable. Shame on the vendor. Will never order anything again."
2,sprayer doesn't work,"I love this perfume, however the sprayer didn't work...don't think I'll be ordering from this company again"
1,1st & 2nd time POOR results!,"This is the 2nd and last time I order from this place! Both times we received the product and it doesn't work(the spray/pump). What a joke, a full bottle of perfume and no way to apply it."
3,Not how I remember!,"The seller is wonderful and fast in shipping. Although this is not the Il Bacio that I remember. The smell is a little weak. I used to wear this fragrance back in the 90's and men would flock to me wanting to know what I was wearing. That's not the reason that I purchased it though. I purchased this because I loved the way it used to smell fresh yet elegant, sexy and refined. This used to be my special occasion fragrance and that's what I purchased it for. I have since found a new fragrance for special occasions and just use the Il Bacio as a go too for everyday use. Such a shame because I was wanting this sooooo badly since I knew it was hard to find. Good Luck I hope it works for you if you decide to purchase anyway!"
1,These Jerks Sent a Leaky Bottle,"When we received the package and opened it, we found the bottle of perfume had leaked badly. Not only was the most expensive item in the package nearly gone, it had contaminated the other item.I'll be DAMNED if I ever order anything from these scumbags again!"
1,rancid smelling,"I have been wearing this perfume for 10+ years and ordered from Amazon for the first time and it was horrible smelling. I wish I had paid more attention to the other reviews for this product before ordering it. Amazon did make it right by refunding my money since I am a very good customer and I will continue to be because they did take care of the problem. But, like others, I will not order this perfume again from Amazon, which is too bad because it would have made it more convenient if I could. :("
3,Lovely.....BUT,"I've used this perfume for years and really love it. The only thing is the pump on the bottle for the spray NEVER EVER works. Surely the company must be aware of this problem by now, when it's been going on for so many years. I have to use pliers to get the bottle open every time, a bit ridiculous I think! This is why I'm awarding it 3 stars, I would give it a full 5 for the scent though."
2,Uncomfortable; I returned it,"I found the DreamSacks Silk Sleep Sack made me hot, and it was so light, I found myself getting twisted up in it at night because i turn so much. It was pretty well made, and the idea is good... but I was definitely not cozy nor comfortable."
3,Satisfactory,"Like the weight and size of the sack, but was disappointed that it came apart so easily at the velcro seam. Though I appreciate being able to open it up on the side / seam, would be better if it only opened with intended effort."
1,Company not service oriented,"This is very good coffee. However, in addition to being overpriced, I was stuck with a Fed Ex charge of $10.00. I had requested USPS standard shipping. The product arrived in 2 days. When I queried the company by email, the reply they sent was condescending, inferring I had not read their ad correctly; and challenged me to match wits if I didn't think they were right in their justification. I knew they were right, but expected an apology and/or an expression of appreciation for my business. Perhaps a way to order more and save on shipping. I was shocked at the attitude and just wrote them that I would buy my supplies elsewhere. Letting future purchasers know the company's feelings toward their buying public is my way of protesting."
5,At his grandparents house he has a weird summer.,"In Arthur for the very first time, Arthur's parents fight somuch that they have to send him away because they don't want him tohave to listen to them fight. So they send him away to his aunt and uncle's house .At his aunt and uncle's house he has a weird summer. His aunt and uncle talk to chickens in French, his uncle sings to pigs, and his uncle grows roses and onions. He writes things down in his journal. I recommend this book becasue it has a lot of humor throughout the story. The story also has a beautiful writing style."
3,I think it is a book for all ages.,"Arthur For the Very First Timeis about Arthur going to his uncle's house. It is also about a friendship between Moria and Arthur. The setting is in Uncle Wrisby's house. The conflicts are that Arthur's mother is sick.And that Bernadette is about tohave a baby. The problem with having a baby is because Arthur has to build a pen for Bernadette. I recommend this book because it is weird, funny, scary, and fun! I also recommend this book because I think it is a book for all ages. Arthur is a moving character."
4,They have to send him away to his aunt and uncle's house.,"In Arthur For the Very First Time, Arthur's parents think thatthey are going to have a baby.They have to send him away to his auntand uncle's house.At his aunt and uncle's house they have a barn and, of course, a house. A conflict in the story is that Yo-Yo sometimes raises prices. Also another conflict is that Author and Moira get drunk. I like this book because Moria looks up the Wrong dedinition in the french book.I recommend this book because it will be funny towards the end."
3,Interesting and Fast Read....,"However, I feel the book should have been written once the trial was over to give the reader the whole complete picture of the case from start to finish. I also took note that certain areas of the book repeated itself over and over and over again with the same quotes by different people or the same quotes written differently by the same people. That became annoying after awhile becuz I found myslef saying, ""I just read this exact quote in the page before.""At any rate, the story itself was amazing but I'd still would have liked to find out what happened during the trial."
1,Don't purchase A-zoom snap caps from Amazon,"The snap caps were used by others prior to being sent to me: both snap caps had been cycled through someone's shotgun but not mine! Chips were found on the rims of each and firing pin indentations were found on each fake firing pin where the firing pin had struck each snap cap.Shame on Amazon for sending a used product that had been returned. Until now, I had been a faithful believer in Amazon's quality control. I have made many purchases and admittedly I had questioned the ""newness"" of some (i.e., Spyderco knives) purchases but always until now had given the benefit of my doubt. However, this purchase was a game changer."
5,Excellent,Best snap caps I've found. Perfect fit. Very durable. It is a quality product and feels like quality in your hand.
5,Jake Olsen's Review of Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant,"Length:: 9:55 MinsJake Olsen's review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Fall 2008 Honors Colloquium on Creative Destruction at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond. (The course syllabus stated that part of the critical review assignment consisted of the making of a video recording of the review, and the posting of the review to Amazon.)"
4,great book,"I chose this book because marketing and starting a business are subjects that I am interested in. This book is really good, it gives you a lot of insight on what to do when you are head to head with competition and stuck on your sales. a lot of the strategies that this book mentions make perfect sense. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars.hey mr vogel this is not my account instead i used my cousins because i had to purchase something in order to write a review!k .koolAdam Ramirez eng 340 m/w 730"
2,Not really anything new,"This book is for anyone who is new to the methodology of blue ocean strategy. Since I have read a few books and studied strategy and innovation, it didn't really give me any new input. On the other hand, blue ocean strategy is a useful tool among many others, so it can be a fair start."
3,Great Book With Great Examples,"This book focuses on the obvious, but often neglected question: What will delight the customer?The book uses examples to convey the basic idea of blue ocean vs red ocean at the start and then builds on that understanding.After having read his book, I have been able to utilize some of the concepts and skills to revise the business strategy of my wife's company for the better.The book exposes the reader to ideas and concepts, but does NOT provide a failsafe strategy."
4,Enjoyed it but it's not a book for purists.,"Yeah. I thought this was about how to discover a true blue ocean not create one. I thought the focus would be more on fresh innovations. Nevertheless, this book has invaluable information."
5,I have used the concepts described in this book over...,and over again. I can't say enough good things about this book or the clear case studies within. I have used the concept of uncontested marketspace to create new revenue streams for my own company as well as a number of other businesses. I highly recommend it! Joel
3,Blue Oceans Okay,The CD version of the book was okay. Some good ideas sprinkled throughout the book but a fair amount of repetition of the same ideas.
4,Blue Ocean Strategy,"The book presents challenging alternatives to pursuing your product's place in the marketplace. It defines a blue ocean strategy, as compared to a red o s, as one in which you find an unorthodox approach to your customer with either a new/different product or service than that which your traditional competitors would typically use.It is well written and extremely thought provoking. It uses well known products in the marketplace today, to make its' point."
2,Game show host voice with many mispronunciations,"I must say that there were some interesting observations conveyed throughout the book, but the 'Game Show Host Voice' of the reader, the many mispronunciations, and the shear repetition of only vaguely interesting business examples from 100 years ago leads me to giving this book a low score."
4,"Far better than most, but not perfect","I'll have to agree with some of the negative reviews....the authors put too much emphasis on pretty charts and the same few examples...almost trivializing the concept of ""strategy"" in the process.However, what this book does provide is yet another way to look at the challenges facing industry and a possible way of framing responses to those challenges. Many times, the key to coming up with the right solution is to simply phrase the question differently. Blue Ocean Strategy looks at re-phrasing the typical competitive strategy (how to lower cost, pump out more landfill, etc). It is a worthwhile read, and I highly recommend it, just don't fall into the typical management trap of ""this is the hottest trend and the only book you need to read""."
4,"Chock full of graphs, figures and action plans!","Is it possible to find a book to be boring and interesting at the same time?* In Blue Ocean Strategy, some sections of the book I found myself re-reading twice just to ensure I fully understood the author's intent.* Other parts, I entirely skipped over due to extreme boredom.* And in other sections, I fully embraced the content and couldn't get enough!This very complex, hard-hitting, detailed book is perfect for business junkies who want to learn innovative strategic methods for increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of their business operations. If you are ready to THINK and ACT outside the box and take your business to another level, by differentiating your products and services and separating yourself from the competition, then this book is for you."
5,Great Even for Novice,"What can I say that has not been said about this book? Here is a more personal appreciation.This is the first book I've read about branding and differentiation. The author is full of common sense but theweird thing as that this type of common sense is not so common in business. Obviously this is not a step bystep guide to building a great business. There is no such thing. What you do get is a nice frameworkto position your idea and see how you compare within your extended competitive landscape. Applying thisframework to your own idea might require more intuition than you think (otherwise creating the next best thing would be too simple) but the author uses many case studies as examples of how to use the framework.Of course, he has the benefit of hindsight but that's no reason to dismiss the ideas. Great book and fun to read."
2,I'm so confused,"First, there doesn't seem to be anything here besides, don't try Peter Druker's ""fustest with the mustest"" strategy. These authors have some ""tool"" called a ""strategy canvas"", but it doesn't make sense at all. It's a line graph, and they say that if the line goes up and down a lot, you don't have a coherent strategy. The trouble is, a line that goes up and down a lot can be turned into a line that makes just one transition from down to up by resorting the items on the x-axis, but they never really define how the x-axis should be ordered. Go with the original Druker book instead."
3,"Good idea, but too little material for a book","This book has a very good point to make - basically, avoiding competition and finding your own market niche is a good idea. But that is not really enough material for a complete book, so there is a lot of filler included, and even then, it's a short book.If you are a newcomer to business or product strategy, you will find this book helpful and easy to read."
2,Simplistic and Vastly Over-rated,"I find this strategy model to be a far too simplistic of the real business world and, thus, vastly over-rated in terms of its value. It deals with the ""old"" analog business world and pays little regard to the major changes sweeping corporations with the digital revolution..In my opinion, of far greater value is a book called ""BIZNETS: The Webopoly Future of Business"" by Frank Feather, and I suggest you check that out and compare before buying this one. It covers 6 case studies to find the common threads of successful strategy in the ""new"" and future digital business world..By contrast, Blue Ocean is somewhat tired. Sure, I highly regard the successes of some of the chosen companies. But the way they are presented is so 1980s. I rate it 2 stars.."
3,My Opinion,"Blue Ocean Strategy is a worthwhile read for any business wanting to position itself for a profitable and long future. It takes a while to make the point, which really could be summarized in a few pages - but aren't most business and strategy books like that?I would recommend it to many friends who are starting out in their own buisinesses."
3,good book at the conceptual level,Good book at the conceptual level. The main idea is to identify new market where no competetion exists and establish your company. I find the book to be more inspiring than practical. The frameworks used are not original and I found them very academic.
5,Blue Ocean Strategy,"Great read - recommended by a colleague, it gives a unique strategy for navigating the marketing world, regardless of economic challenges or competition."
5,A must for anyone starting a new venture!,"Having come from a rather technical background, working in a relatively small professional environment, I bought Blue Ocean Strategy at the suggestion of a potential business partner who has followed it's principals successfully in several endeavors. I found it fascinating, straight forward and easy to comprehend, without having to wade through a lot of academic pontificating to get to the meat of the concepts. I recommend it, highly, to anyone considering starting a new business or looking to rescue an existing venture."
3,was for school,"This book was for school, can't say that i hated it or loved it. it was a necessary purchase. Sorry"
4,Good read,"Its a good book on strategy. Few examples are repeated over and over. But all in all, did not disappoint."
4,The mother of reinvention...,"This book helps focus the reader on looking at their business, competition and offerings in different and exciting ways. If you are considering a new business venture or product offering, you really should read this book."
4,Several chapters too long,Overall this is a fantastic title but condensed it is not. The authors could have written it in half as many pages without losing any useful information. In terms of content its a solid 8 our of 10.
1,A hype I don't understand,I absolutely agree with the last comment. Except for the good term 'value creation' I found nothing new.Saying brands have become less important as price has an influence on whether a customer buys Colgate or Crest is strange. (Both have significant brand equity). Also I think saying line extensions generate little revenue compared to entirely new produces is giving wrong impressions. The developing costs for new products and (possibly new sales channels) must be taken into account.I'm surprised about the hype and that so many people like it.
4,Worth Understanding the Principles in this Book,"The theories and stories in this book should be read by anyone currently a part of running a business. Essentially, a blue ocean is a new market that reaches out to a population not contemplated by the current companies in an existing market. The authors warn companies to get out of the red oceans where daily and bloody battles for market share and new customers occur each day and encourages readers to create a new market, where untapped customers will be drawn in and competition becomes irrelevant because there are no more players in the game. This means changing the status quo, something that is hardly easy, but is critical in remaining competitive in today's global market. This book is a quick read and the ideas and strategies are worth understanding and applying."
5,Blue Ocean is a must Read,Good Book and a must read for anyone starting a Business or a new venture.
4,Great complement to other strategy titles,"Before purchasing this I was skeptical - is this another hype book for more of the same. It is a good book with many relevant examples and solid frameworks for expanding into new markets and ""Blue Oceans"". While a few of the concepts are at odds (in a good way) with traditional strategy (Porter, Moore, etc.), most are complementary.If you are a student of strategy and want to grow, then add this to your library."
2,"Interesting Reading, But Too Much Hype","I can't understand the reason behing all the good ratings and hype. Perhaps it's because the catchy name and the human relentless search for new fashions and trends. It's also interesting to notice that the book was written by two professors who lack the real world experience and challenge of running a company. They use past success stories that match their theory while neglecting the others. The concept of differentiation through quality or cost was presented several years ago by Michael Porter, and the Quality Function Deployment and Kano Models are excellent tools for describing the customer value."
4,avoid over competitive marketplaces and focus on better opportunities,"""Reminder to stay out of over-competitive markets in order to truly break through to profits and success."""
5,"Fast shipping, great customer service",The book arrived in top class condition as promised within a week for standard shipping. I would definately recommend this seller.
3,"Great thoughts, not so good implementation","This is a good book all in all, the thoughts, ideas, the knowledge and information is all there, intriguing and eye opener, the only problem with it is the business-like writing style, full of jargon words, and terminology that are already confusing in their own natural habitats, not to mention in this ""supposedly"" fun-to-read book. There were times when I lost interest in reading all the way to the end of a paragraph, or simply dozed off doing it. The style of writing is a bit boring. (Or, I might be getting used to more amusing books to read, my favorites are Malcolm Gladwell's writings, and freakonomics, and the like, which are high up there on the scale of fun-to-read.)"
3,"Easy to read, some good points.","Several of the companies mentioned in this book as exemplary have lost their way, becoming one more player or going bankrupt. Keymart, Borders, Curves are the ones that come quickly to my mind. And then, Barnes and Noble is facing some though times, and HP was recently trying to get out of PC sales.The authors innoculated themselves against criticism, though, by saying that no company dominates forever, and that blue oceans have to be created, defended and abandoned continually.The part I liked best about the book was the concept of Process Fairness through engagement, explanation and expectation clarity, which I think is a fancy name for change management. I also liked the story of the computers starting at the tabulating machines, and the story of movie theathers.Overall, the book is easy to read and has some good tips."
4,Simple and powerful!,A great deal of business literature has been developed to pinpoint ways to beat the competition. Porter dedicates a lot of thought to describing barriers to entry and differentiated product offerings. What is so great about Blue Ocean Strategy is that you no longer have to worry about competitors. Find a market that isn't yet saturated with players. Be creative and open your mind beyond the obvious markets that already exist and are probably in a phase of decline. Well worth a read.
3,Principles copied from Ancient Chinese philosophy,"Readers of the Taoist text Tao Te Qing (Dao Dejing) will find Kim and Mauborgne's Blue Ocean is based on Laozi's Water Analogy.In the original philosophical context - The highest value is like water; the value of water benefits all things, and yet it does not content. It stays in places that others disdain. And thus is close to the Tao.....Since, indeed, they do not content, there is no resentment. This can be found in passage eight of R L Wing's The Tao of Power.W. Chan Kim, being ethnically Korean, is no doubt exposed to insightful Chinese thought and have incorporated them into a modern corporate context."
5,Excellent book,"This book not only introduces blue ocean strategy as a concept, but also provides tools for crafting a blue ocean strategy. Must read for marketing people to spur Value innovation in a company."
4,Very inspirational.. gets ya thinking..,Still reading but really like it so far... very inspiring - if you want to follow your dreams and stand out from everyone including your competition....
4,The misunderstood truth of business,"I've read this before and it's brilliant. It's a bit involved to understand, and even more difficult to apply to your own business, but it is worth the investment. I consult for businesses in NYC and guide them better with the teachings and tools of this book. It's accurate, timeless and profound."
3,OK,"Book was ok, A lot of rehashed and reworked ideas. I guess there really isn't anything new under the sun."
4,An Excellent and compelling listen,A good summary of moving from just another commodity business competing at the same level as others in your industry - to completely changing your value proposition and differentiating your organization.
5,Do you Get It ?,"If you have an open mind.. you will get it. If not go back to your corproate world, bring home a pay check and retire.If you want to honestly make a change to help your company.. then heed these words."
2,Blue Ocean Strategy,"I have bad experience as well as good ones with Amazon. This was one of the better ones. The books came fast. I bought new editions though so there isn't much else to say about that, but thanks for making life easier and haveing so many options."
5,It's not the delivery; it's the content,"Blue Ocean Strategies are responsible for HUGE amounts of wealth having been generated by many people and many companies.However, these CD's are delivered with NO Narrative and since the concepts in the book are shared using diagramatic tools which clarify the text; listening can some times be trying and laborious.Getting past that will reward you with a whole new way to think of markets and marketing.I recommend them for those interested in the subject for more than just entertainment. You'll want to read the book to get the part you miss."
2,disappointed in the Blue Ocean Strategy,This book is redundant! It should have been a pamphlet. Good concept though.
2,"This book reports on what some companies have done to be successful, offering little practical advice.","It has some interesting observations, but is light on content. It lacks specific advice and has few tactics you can actually use. Though it's good for people who just want to know things but don't want to do anything about it."
5,Amazing insights,"This is a significant book that will shape the way we think of innovation, technology, and getting out front of the competition. I recommend it for anyone who aspires to build a company, change a company, or just see the future unfold."
2,A highschool book,"The good news:The book is not wrong. It is indeed a positive to find/create a market that is no contested.The bad news:It doesn't tell you how to create and sustain one.The veredict:A good book to give to highschool students, this might be ""news"" to them. But if you are more advanced in your career this is defo trivial stuff."
1,Overrated fluff. Nothing original at all.,"This book was a severe disappointment. It's a well-known strategy book with an catchy title and reasonably compelling reputation. This was my second time reading it, after throwing it away in frustration a few years ago. Opening up vast blue oceans of opportunity - who wouldn't want that? Unfortunately, it falls far short of the hype. Another reviewer described it as ""fluff"" - they are correct. The book is full of vague theorizing, with little in the way of an actual framework to think about strategy. Nor are there significant insights from successful thinkers, which would have been valuable in lieu of a framework. If you have even a basic amount of business knowledge and some experience to match, this book offers very little. Stay away - your time and money are better spent elsewhere."
5,Great book on effective market strategy!,"I forget how I came across this book, but I am glad I did. The first few chapters of it are worth taking the time to capture into a 1-2 page cheat sheet that can be reviewed quickly before going into a strategy session. The book is well worth the money and time spent acquring and reading it."
5,Imagine,"""Don't miss this book""! Wou will come away with some extraordinary insights if you want your company to work and people to care."
4,Excellent guiding questions,"The book offers at the end of each chapter questions that can guide the reader to put the concepts into use right away. This is an excellent feature since it can be used and applied repeatedly. If a question is not clear, you can always refer to the chapter at issue. The book overall was a great read!"
1,A book that is a marketing gimmick itself,"Much of the theories and methods described in the book have been covered in listless marketing books.The line graphs that the argument is based on is based on an arbitrary positioning of the different factors along the chart. You can make any companies look like one that has opened up a so-called ""blue ocean of uncontested market space"" on the line graphs by simply moving the factors along the line.Secondly, the survey / research cited never offers clear definition of key terminologies used, no clear explanation on how the research sample was chosen and no clear list of when or where that research actually took place.It is a book that is written to wow readers with a pleasing visual image with contents that are recycled from past marketing books and arbitrary use of statistics that will not even hold on an academic level.A total waste of money."
2,Blue Ocean Strategy audio cassettes,I bought this audio cassette hoping to listen to it during my commute. The reader has a monotone voice and references graphics that you can't see without explaining them. His voice was too difficult to listen to so I never finished the cassettes.
2,Student book not included,The description states that the student workbook is included. It did not come with it. Only the TM and CD are included
4,Great Gift for those who are always on the road!,This is a great gift! I got it for my Dad and I hope he likes it. I know i will use it if he doesn't! It's size is perfect and very nice quality. The plug it comes with is made for a cigarette lighter so you can put it in your car.The door stays closed tightly so nothing will come out.The color is nicer than i thought and great for the idealistic price.
1,Too small to be of much use,"The concept seemed good, but the space inside is so small it's really not practical."
3,Vector portable fridge,"Unit works as advertised. However, the fan is very noisy so it's not really well suited for use in the house for a long period."
4,"My yoga-loving, frog-loving girlfriend loved it",It's adorable to my girlfriend and was a sure-fire win on the gift front. It's amusing and cute... and makes sense to her as she loves yoga. I love a gift winner!
5,Prog Rock Updated for 2000,"I wasn't the biggest fan of the old 70's prog rock, but these guys only use that as a jumping off point. Their sound is edgier and their vocals, by Ken Pfeifer, are better than those of the bands that inspired them. My only complaint is that the recording is a bit bass heavy, but you can just tweak your EQ. Definitely worth checking out, especially if you actually like the old prog stuff."
5,QUALITY,"Quality product, washes well. I've had it for a few years and still looks brand new! Excellent deal! Very satisfied!"
5,Review,This product arrived in a timely manner and was in the conditions specified in the details from the seller. I was satisfied with both my purchase and sellers.
1,review,Book was not what i expected. Highlighted underlined sloppy and bended. Will be hard to read but is needed so will keep.
5,I love this book!,I had to get this book for a class. I have loved it! I would definitely suggest it for thinking about feminism in a more global context.
1,Complete waste of money!,"This tool is a absolute joke. Mine doesnt expand at all, even when it isnt in a pipe! Then there is the finish, someone used a can of the cheapest spray paint they could find, and painted it fully assembled. The paint was chipped in places, pooled in others, and missing all together in others. Paint dripped down on to all the ground bearing surfaces, threads, painted over the 2 o rings, the solvents in the paint i'm sure degraded the o rings.I rented a OEM brand tool (linked below) from AutoZone, took them apart and compared the two, they are designed somewhat similarly, but I can't figure out how this Lisle tool could possibly ever work unless you welded the far forcing code to the 6 expander sections.Dont waste your money, and thank god Amazon has prepaid returns.http://www.amazon.com/Tailpipe-Expander-2-1-Inch-3-7/dp/B004FDMWAE/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1338008022&sr;=1-1-catcorr"
4,Another great story by Heather Graham,"I enjoyed this book. I thought that it was well written and kept me on my toes. Like all of her books, once I start I can't put it down."
3,The Premise is a Good One....,"The story line is a good one but it seems lately in her books, that the dialogue between the characters is childish. These people are supposed to be adults.But there is more whining between the characters than there is in a day care center. If some of my friends behaved like this I don't think I could stand to be around them. I gave it a 3 on the story line alone. ....."
2,Too Much Boring Meaningless Dialogue,"I think the title for my review sums it up for me. There was so much meaningless dialogue between too many characters. I stopped reading every line and skipped ahead to the end to see ""who dunnit"". I felt the book could have been really good if the story had been better developed."
4,Excellent,"Enjoyed as always with another Heather Graham book. Fast paced,easy reading and as always Heather Graham has brought true history and present into her books."
5,Key West Will Never Be the Same . . .,"Sometimes you think you see things, but just know you have to be mistaken. Heather Graham takes that eerie feeling and crafts this excellent paranormal romantic suspense in a tropical locale dear to this reader's heart. Now, when I cruise Duvall Street or gaze out at the turqoise Atlantic, I'm drawn into thinking about ghosts of the dead wanting to be vindicated! A must read!"
5,I love paranormal books.,"This type of book keeps me wanting to read it in one night, but reality come in and I know that I have to get up in the morning to work."
5,Love it,Heather Graham does great job combining paranormal and romance and draws you into the story to where you don't want to put the book down
2,It's mostly snacks,"I bought several cookbooks for my 7 year old picky eater, hoping it would make him more willing to eat meals he helped cook. I was really disappointed in this one. It contains ""recipes"" like putting sliced cheese and sliced ham on a sliced Pilsbury biscuit. Even a kid doesn't need a cookbook for that. The most disappointing thing was the lack of meals. There's a lot of ham and cheese: on bisuits, on buns, on bread. The rest of the book is mostly snacks. Snacks are not that useful for me."
1,Revolting,"I was shocked to find that almost every ""recipe"" is built around a processed food. This is not a real cookbook, only a book of directions on how to make a commercial processed food product into something a little fancier. Don't waste your money if you are at all health conscious or food conscious. There are plenty of cookbooks out there that actually teach a child to cook real food."
4,This one will stretch you!,This dissertation of Dr. C. Marvin Pate contains the deep Christological content that he is known for. Focusing on 2 Corinthians 4:7-5:21 Dr. Pate sheds new light to this well known passage as he explains the Adam-Christ theology that is the underlining theme of Paul's writting. This book is well worth wrestling with but must be given a generous amount of time to work through. At the end of the day you will be glad you perservered through this fine book from such a respected author.
4,great switch,"Does what is expected: It's a switch, it works, it doesn't cause problems. Installed in attic, serving some 8 devices."
1,Sinatra would not watch these videos.,"It pains me to write bad review about a Sinatra product, but remember, this isn't a review about the man or the singer, just the series of tapes that, in my opinion were very poorly produced. I watched 6 out of the set and gave up. The tapes run between 45 and 50 minutes and much of that time is filled with still photographs of Frank and some of his frieinds. It was almost like the producers ran out of material to fill 10 tapes. The most frustrating aspect for me was that the narration rarely coincided with the video. There were a few interesting clips from old TV shows that featured Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee, Judy Garland and Dean Martin and some other clips of his visits abroad but, for the most part, I found it very disappointing. In addition, each tape has the same 10 second intro by Princess Grace and just ends by going to black. There are some good Sinatra video biographies out here, but this isn't one of them."
5,Solid work plank,"Feels good even at full extension. Very handy. A little heavy but stable. If you need a work plank, then this is a good one."
4,Worth my bucks!,Yeah it wasn't cheap but its pretty sweet. I prefer the new effects. The sound is way quiet but whatever I just turn it way up.
2,You get what you pay for,"The sheets are soft, large enough so they don't slip off your matress, but don't buy them if you don't like ironing. They are a wrinkled mess after laundering."
2,"Misleading on the two pillowcases, etc.","I bought this twin set because it advertised as having 2 pillowcases. Most twin sets only have one. However, when I received the order, it only had 1 pillowcase inside. I checked the packaging and it said it only comes with 1 pillowcase. The advertisement on the website is misleading. Also, after 1 washing, the set came out terribly wrinkled. The set was also not as soft as advertised and did not appear to be ""Sateen"" at all. I would not recommend this product or buy it again."
5,Not what I thought- in a good way!,"I'm not much for poetry, but this book was very different for me. I got caught up in the story and taken on the dark journey of the author's past. This book was recommended to me by a good friend, and now I know why."
2,Mother mocks child,"This is the first book I got to share with my 2 year old about learning to swim. The model is basically that the mother laughs at and mocks the child's ineptitude, and eventually the child learns to swim out of sheer luck. This is not how I would teach, and I would want my child not to have to learn without instruction. Also, I did not like the example of Froggy trying to swing as high as he could until the swing went over the top of the swingset. The climax and denouement involve Froggy's pants coming off in the water. If your child is older (maybe 7 or so) and still does not know how to swim, this book is for you. Otherwise, you are probably better off making up your own story."
3,Running out of steam,"I recall playing Railroad Tycoon 1 with much more excitement than in this version. Perhaps, I was more of kid back then, but the setup of campaigns takes some of the fun out of the game. Each campaign has a goal and depending on how well you do, you are awarded either bronze, silver, or gold. I agree that the campaigns are a good way to walk the user through the game and introduce various ways to win each campaign, but it gets old after the first scenario. Other than that, RT2 is a good follow up game to the original. It has most everything the first did and even more. I like how the stock market is in the game, even issuing bonds and shorting stocks. The track and station build is improved and the graphics were good for its time. Overall, I still recommend the game, but I would have rather have a single goal game, which is to win."
4,All you need to know,"Great book,with photo's and info on the stars of the show.Give an insight into all the episodes,I just loved it"
1,I really don't like this book.,"As a high school student, I find this book to be quite simplistic and not as helpful as other Spanish texts. It goes as far at some points as to insult my intelligence. I would strongly suggest another Spanish program."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"I bought a set of these (1/4"" 3/8""&1/2"" drive) back in 1999 and the square drive had no excess play like this ratchet has, but it's still a nice tool in tight spaces where you can't get an air tool into."
4,Burmese Trek,Well written with vivid boyhood memories. Also shows how history forgets the details. A very enjoyable read. Book in great condition with very good sales service.
5,I like this book,"This book is really neat. I like the fact that the different ""myths"" are consolidated into a common area."
4,Exam 70-229,"Fairly good book with some problems in repetitive text. Do NOT count on this book as your only resource for the 70-229 exam. Then again, it's foolish to expect to pay $40 to pass this very difficult exam. I passed the exam but used a test engine endorsed by Microsoft.Bottom line: Outstanding value @ $40. Four stars because of the repetitive text, otherwise I would give it five."
4,Covers requirements,This Kit covers what should be expected to be known to passthe exam.Further reading is required.
1,"Sales book, not good for certification","I bought this book, thinking I would get certified.I spent 2 months reading the pages, and doing the exercises.Then I went to take the exam... Failed 3 times before I actually threw the book away and searched for another training source. And I'm not a dufus; I've passed many certification exams in the past.This book contains SOME quality information, but if your goal is to get certified, just read Books On Line and totally disreguard the existance of this book.Its common knowledge that the goal of MS certification tests is to test your ability to transform working knowledge of a product into real world application, and for that reason, an effective training source should simulate that real world expierence. This book fails to do this."
3,70-229 SQL 2k Design and Implementation,I was not pleased with the contents of this book in terms of sloppy editing and in the paltry treatment of important topics. Those of us in pursuit of the MCP or MCDBA will have to augment this book and what we take from this book with other more complex books dealing with design and implementation. Do be prepared to purchase additional books on T-SQL programming and do be prepared to purchase real exam prep software.
1,"Not quite worthless, but close","Most of the Microsoft certification books are bad, and this is no exception. A lot of page space is used explaining how wonderful Microsoft products are and no space is used defining the obscure terms that are constantly bandied about. Often a common word is used to mean something totally different than what it means to the rest of the world. Other times terms are just made up and never defined. The exercises are tedious, though occasionally userful.Buy a different book."
2,Exam Topic Overview Only,This book gives an introduction to the topics required for the exam but nowhere near the detail required. Attempt a practice exam after reading the book and you will realise how inadequate this training resource truly is.
2,Could be better,"I am after the first two chapters and I'm not very impressed so far.The first chapter contains a lot of names of different components of SQL Server without clear explanations useful in case of people new to SQL Server, too messy.Chapter two contains terms without sufficient explanations and examples how to use them (isqlw, isql, osql for example).If you are an expert in SQL Server you do not need this book but if you want to learn the book is too enigmatic so far."
1,Penguin kindle version gibberish,"This current kindle version prepared by Penguin is simply unendurable. The line numbers (every tenth line) are set to the right margin WITHIN and INTRUDING INTO the text of the poems themselves. Penguin has made a business decision to offer many of their Classics in ebook form, and good for that. Unfortunately they gave the task in many instances to persons with no feeling for how the result looks. Given that they're charging nearly full price, there's no excuse for offering a product so shoddy."
5,Love his poems!,"I just received this book earlier today and all I can say is wow! A complete and total genius! This is a must have for your library of poetry. As soon as you get it I would recommend you to fully reading the Rime of the Ancient Mariner.This just blew me away;Water, water, everywhere,And all the boards did shrink;Water, water, everywhere,Nor any drop to drink.Genius with words and master of painting pictures with them to really make you think and envision what he is trying to show you! The list goes and the poems are just amazing! You need to buy this book!"
1,You must on use them,The persons that reviewed the trays must only look at them..Never get used....Or they are not truthful
5,Absolutely Beautiful,These TV Trays have such a beautiful screen print of different wine labels and they have a larger flat surface that other trays.
2,Ruined just sitting there,"These are beautiful tables, and I found them to be quite sturdy. Unlike others, I had no problem assembling the stand. HOWEVER, the screws that support the back of the table rest against the other tray top in the stand and the first time I went to use the tables the screws from one tray had sratched the tops of the next one in the stand completely ruining the top. I am extremely dissapointed. I bought them for the looks of the tray tops and now--5 days later!--they are scratched and unpresentable. I am utterly disapointed."
1,tv trays,"Not a good purchase...the screws on backs of trays scratch table tops when in the holder..Don't waste you money unless you just want to set out and never use the holder as it will damage them..have seen trays for 40.00 with better construction. The tops of the tables are beautiful, but the holder makes it impossible to use and not have scratches..Oh well, if you want just to set out and not use holder then trays have a very nice look"
2,Beware the Wine Labels,"I thought this set of TV trays was so attractive. I was disappointed at the construction of the stand and the assembly needed,and the fact that the trays don't lock securely in place and can collapse when moved. The third day I had them I tried to remove a sticker that was stuck to the tray and a quarter-sized piece of the label came off with it!! The quality certainly doesn't match the price of this item! I am very disappointed."
2,Not well made...expensive,Not at all pleased with the quality of the tables. Mine arrived damaged because the wine labels are just decals stuck on the surface of the table so part of one was ripped. I would suppose that these tables would not last especially the wine label stickers. I bought them as a gift but I will be returning them.
4,Fabulous trays! Not-so-fabulous-stand.,"These TV trays are gorgeous and very sturdy. A good buy. Be forewarned however about assembly of the stand. The screws for this project are too big and split the composite wood slats in two places. Marshall Field's Customer Service could not replace the slats, only exchange the entire shipment. In order to avoid this problem, I suggest that you pre-drill the holes with a slightly smaller bit size before screwing thr stand together. My fiance had a bigger job on his hands than he bargained for (i.e., &amp;amp;quot;some assembly required&amp;amp;quot;) in having to glue the split pieces together, use wood filler, and then stain to match."
2,Pretty But Poorly Made,"Frankly, these are the most expensive TV Trays I've ever seen, and one should be able to expect excellent look feel and construction from them. We purchased them because they perfectly match some wine label art we have on the walls in our nook area. While these look great, they are made VERY poorly. One of our trays is essentially impossible to unfold and fold without the support strut coming apart. Then when unfolded, it wobbles terribly. Additionally, the stand is assembly required and due to the design it is impossible to assemble it without it having considerable wobble as well.Overall, this is a $20 set of trays with labels on them. If you can live with that then go ahead and buy them."
4,Only book of its kind .. .found it invaluable!!,"As a 15 year PC user & tech support person, I am struggling to learn the MAC environment. Using this guide made my life much simpler, and I have personally recommended it to several users here in our company who are going PC->MAC and MAC->PC. If you've ever tried to learn a ""foreign language"" and used a translating dictionary ... you'll immediately know how to use this book. This is one tech book that won't sit on your bookshelf collecting dust!"
2,Where can I start.......,"This board has been more headache than marrying a stupid woman.It ran good for 1 month then went berserk, would not boot, not matter what Bios I used. So I set it aside for two monhs and one day picked it up and it worked but not stable enough for my liking. Would lock up and take too long to boot, I have spent more time on this board in one month than I have slept, tried everything possible. I eventually found one of the problems I was facing, Artic silver compound on north bridge heatsink could cause some problems, I took off all Silver paste and reused white crappy paste and board seem ok, for now.. we'll see been 4 days now.I would try a different Asus motherboard....Oh yea. Asus has the worst tech support there is,, these guys have no idea about anything but what they read in there ""how to fix manual"" issues by Asus."
4,Great instruction!!!!,Highly recommend this instruction video. I'll be dancing like a pro in no time. Can't believe what a workout pole dancing is. Love it!
1,Don't waste your money!,"Would have been fun for the kids if the toys weren't so very cheap! Awful construction, just garbage. A complete waste of money! One of the cheaply made star sabres broke as my husband was taking it out of the box for my son to play with on Christmas morning! Then Anakin's arms fell off as he came out of the box. These are the worst toys I have ever made the mistake of purchasing!"
1,Very erratic performance,"I picked up the SiPix on impulse due to its low price, figuring it would be a fun intro to digital photography and a great way of recording nights out / events at school. The camera is small and lightweight and therefore very good for that. However, it has several severe drawbacks:- By default, the flash is turned off; therefore, photographs are often taken without flash and are unusable- The camera's connection to the computer is erratic - for example, the camera has refused to connect for the past day and required a hard reset (losing all photos!) before it would connect again- Picture quality is often poor, due to lack of focusing mechanism"
1,GARBAGE!,"This camera is ridiculus, i got it for christmas. By 1 year everything was almos broken on it, even thogh it still worked. But now the battery chamber made the battery leak! ridiculus! doesn't even start up or turn on now.Garbage!"
1,as bad as it gets,"this is a follow up, for my prevoius review was too good for the camera. it doesnt work-at all. the only good thing about it is the software but you can't use it too much because the camera will rarely take pictures...or even stay on for over 5 seconds. do not get this camera."
1,Poor Battery Design,"This camera requires two AA bateries and due to the power requirements they have a very short life. The camera is designed for a maximum of 155 shots and the batteries may give up to 20, before they are drained. When the gauge begins to show loss of power it is impossible to transfer images to the computer. If you attempt to insert new batteries all images in the camera are lost. The best that can be hoped for is to take few images, immediately transfer to the computer. Keep an eye on the guage and replace batteries often. Can't be taken on vacation."
1,absolutely horrible,"pros: small, lightweight, and has good softwarethe major cons: zoom, what zoom??horrible picture qualityoverly bright flash, if anyno case. but here's the major one: sometimes it wont even turn on! and during those times if you CAN get it to stay on long enough to press the shutter button, it doesnt take the picture.do NOT buy this camera."
1,Poor Gordon Liu!,Gordon is one of my favorite kung fu stars but he got stuck in some really awful movies after Shaw Brothers closed. This is one of them and the DVD ain't too hot either.
3,"Good drunken style, but not enough","This small-scale Gordon (Master Killer) Liu starrer starts out interesting, then flounders with mediocire fighting and plot. The fights are non-memorable. The actual drunken style combat comes after a long wait, and while satisfying, is somewhat less satisfying than you would have wanted. You would expect more from Gordon Liu."
2,Too bad this is my first online review.....,"....I wanted to save that honor for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but a) most people that found their way here are gonna get that anyway and b) I had to get the word out on this disappointing movie before anybody else wasted their 25-40 bucks on it (depending on where you live).Frankly, this is just garbage. The fight scenes are dull (this is the same choreographer responsible for Legend of Drunken Master?), the story is bland and hackneyed (someone killed his father, he was raised by a martial arts master, goes back for revenge blah blah blah) and the ending.....jeez. When I say it's bad, I don't mean sad - I mean it's bad as in IT MAKES NO SENSE. Cripes, what a letdown. I've heard good things about Gordon Liu, but I really hope that his other work is better than this. Ah well, at least I had Five Deadly Venoms to watch afterwards to lift my spirits back up.Avoid this one like the plague, folks."
3,only for HARDCORE kung fu fans,"The plot doesn't make very much sense in this movie, but then again it doesn't try to. With that being said, I will go ahead and give you the reasons you should watch this and then the reasons why not.Reasons why-great iron whip vs. gordon fight, great fight with gordon and guy with iron with without his whip, final fight scene.This is not a great movie my ANY means, but the jungfu is fun to watch and the commentary means you will watch it at least twice."
4,Drunken Monkey at its Best,This movie has some incredible fight scenes. Gordon Liu learns kung-fu from his drunken master. Just watching Gordon Liu do Drunken Monkey makes this movie a must see! The only problem with this movie is it could have some better training scenes and more all-round action. Last battle is great.
3,A Classic from Gordon Liu and The Lau Brothers,"One would assume with Gordon Liu Chia Hui aka Lau Kar Fai in a movie directed by Lau Kar Leung (Director of Drunken Master 2) that the movie would be outstanding. Well you would be somewhat of the mark with your assumptions on this movie.Gordon Liu plays a man whose parents are brutally murdered when he was a child. As a child he too was left to drown as the local thugs tried to eliminate his entire family. Before he meets his demise, he is rescued and saved by an old drunken monk who raises him while being the meanest old monk on the planet.The monk teaches him kung fu and the ""8 drunk gods technique"". Gordon then decides to take his revenge. First he kidnaps the leaders daughter, who just happens to be an old childhood sweethart of his. When the daughter ends up missing, all hell breaks loose.The fights are choreographed over the top, however, this is clearly not the best from Gordon Liu or the Lau Brothers. Get it because it's a classic."
3,"So cheesy, it's great.","I'm surprised more people don't know about this notorious B-grade Gordon Liu classic.Where to begin? The English dubbing is atrocious, with most of the Limey actors who did the job sounding like they're either bored, drunk, or both. The plot is of the cliched, predictable kind that's been done in other kung fu B-movies countless times (i.e., hero gets revenge on bad guys for death of father). Most of the fight scenes are badly choreographed, plus you can see the wires in some shots. The treatment of women is awful (in one part of the movie, Gordon Liu kidnaps the daughter of the enemy who killed his father; he then ties her to a wooden pole in his hideout and then leaves her to pee in her pants). What I can't believe is that I don't hate this crap. In fact, I freakin' love it! This flick would probably be great to watch while you were fried or drunk too, especially when the bad guys do the ""Dr. Evil"" laugh."
2,disappointment,"I wasn't extremely interested in hearing dance remixes of Troy, which I consider to be one of the best songs ever created (in its original form). Mostly I bought the CD for the chance to watch the video. I had once seen a clip for the video back in the 1980s and always wanted to see it in its entirety. Unfortunately the video doesn't play on a standard DVD player. The remixes of the song are mediocre. However it does still have the original on there which is worth two stars on its own."
4,Wish these were available in USA-viewing format,"I can't actually recommend the DVDs for ""Still Game"" because I haven't watched them. But I saw several episodes of the show the last time I was in Britain and never laughed so much at any TV sitcom. Who'd have thought that a show about two cantankerous, elderly Scotsmen could be so entertaining?If ever these are produced in a format viewable in the US, I'm game! I'd have the lot. Jack & Victor forever!:-)"
5,Well written and enjoyable!,"I love this book, and read it because my 9 year old son said he enjoyed it so much! Newton is an amazing man and is to be looked up to. His accomplishments are incredible, and include more than gravity! I'm interested in his theological writings and thoughts as I never knew he had any...all I managed to learn in school was that an apple fell on his head and this led to his discovering gravity. The things you miss in grade school! Newton is a fascinationg subject for people of all ages and this book is a great starting point for adults who missed much of what went on in class. For children it is a far more accurate and rounded teaching tool than I ever received for those who are interested in science and in character building.Great to read aloud!"
4,History book,This book was easy to read and I learned a lot about the subject that I didn't know. So I am pleased.
3,The book was short on telling Newton devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ.,It is a good book as to the life of Isaac Newton. What was interesting was his mother leaving him with her mother and sister to marriage the minister to save the farm for her family.
5,Inspiring book!,"Undoubtedly one of the best scientists in history was Isaac Newton. He is well known for discovering the law of gravity, inventing calculus, and making many other important discoveries as well. Unfortunately, one of the least known things about him, is his love for the Bible and respect for God.This book is great for anyone wanting to learn more about this genius of history, including both his Biblical and scientific life."
4,Great piece of history,I loved the level of detail in this book. Very interesting period in our history.
1,A Stunning Disappointment,"Savage Peace, Hope & Fear In America, 1919, Ann Hegedorn; Simon & Schuster, Inc. (2007)I am sorry to say that Anne Hagedorn has taken a monster step both backwards & in the wrong direction with her history of 1919, ""Savage Peace"" (2007).Her almost perfect Wild Ride (1994) has been succeeded by a juvenile, strident, & partisan manner of thinking & writing that has left me quite amazed, & somewhat sorry that she has forgotten the way in which to write maturely & persuasively. It is almost as if SP had been written a decade before WR - not thirteen years later.I made it to p. 116. More appropriately, this should have been done on Armistice Day; Savage Peace - a testament as to how NOT to write ANYTHING - was pulped fourteen days later, on November 25, 2009."
5,Mollie's money-saving tip,Boy was this a great book when my husband & I took a trip through CA. We had a blast at the B&B in Santa Barbara & the savings were great. The book is a MUST-HAVE! ...definitely an undiscovered gem.
1,I only wish,"I only wish I could review this product.I have been trying to get some low, green garden fence for a few weeks now and it's either been out of stock (where I had to replace the order, using another of Amazon's suppliers) or I've been sent the wrong product (where neither I nor Amazon has been able to get a hold of that supplier). Meantime, we are getting deeper into winter and I still don't have the fence I need.I only write this because this is the only time I have been upset with the way Amazon has dropped the ball on my order. True, they are using a third party supplier, but it looks like I may have been better off Googling fencing and ordering it directly."
3,"Fine, not WOW-ing","A pretty decent collection and includes the first full-length feature, hence historically important. However, the sound quality is one of the worst possible on a DVD..and is sometimes annoying..though the picture quality is reasonable for the price. Not a bad piece for a collection, if the Image and Mutual Versions is out-of-bounds for your wallet. If you are expecting a ""real"" DVD-like quality, you will be disappointed. Though, that is the result of the source itself."
4,Image Entertainment Release,Please ignore the reviews for this video that refer to it as a Laser Light release. THIS IS NOT A LASERLIGHT RELEASE. This DVD is remastered by Image Entertainment with a new score. The image quality is pretty good considering this is a film from 1914! Image Entertainment is the best out there when it comes to releasing silent films on DVD. Image Entertainment remasters all their silent films from the best available 35mm nitrate source and they create new scores for the films. Don't let the other reviews turn you off from experiencing this early silent film gem.
4,Not bad,"Sure,the sound is very,very annoying,but the picture quality is suprisingly good.The picture quality on the three short films is good,but the picture on Tillie's Puntured Romance is horrible. This is good for its price.Worth buying if you're too cheap to buy the Image DVDs."
3,"Not bad, for what it's worth","This appears to be the same version that appeared frequently on early cable channels in the early 1980s.The narrator actually helps somewhat, as some of what goes on is a bit hard to follow.Overall, it's an old-timey tale from 1914 where the city slicker (Charlie Chaplin) and his assistant (a rather appealing Mabel Normand)bamboozles the country gal (Marie Dressler). It has its moments. When Charlie and Mabel bilk the country gal out of her bucks, they go to a theater and are horrified to watch a story of a couople of city slickers who rob a country bumpkin. Ridden with guilt, they exit the theater as the story hits way too close to home. Marie Dressler wreaking havoc when she catches Charlie & Mabel making love is also quite humorous.This was the first knwon feature comedy film, and was a good beginning for the genre. By the way, the little boy who Charlie Chaplin slaps was little Milton Berle, who later recalled that Chaplin really hurt him in this scene."
2,Figure Templates for Fashion Illustration,"This book promises more than it delivers. The basic templates are useful, but in all other aspects this book is lacking.The written information is scant and repeated - very superfluous. Mr Ireland's style is very outdated and uninspiring for those hoping to make a career out of fashion - in any form. I would recommend this book only as a basic early tool for novices hoping to improve their figure construction.For inspiration I recommend Laird Borelli's FASHION ILLUSTRATION NOW."
4,great for copying,"this isn't the 'how to draw the fashion model' book you wish taught you everything you ever needed to know. However, its good to have around when you just need to pump an idea out. It has women, men, and children."
4,Figure Templates For Fashion Illustration,"This book is an excellent resource at a resonable price. It is more than a primer. I'd recommend it to anyone, experienced or novice, who designs/illustrates fashion."
4,Great for what I needed it for,"I ordered this book because I'm a very visual person and with writing a novel, I was trying to figure out exactly what kind of fashions/uniforms I wanted in the book. I can draw portriats, but figures...not so much. The only complaint I have about this book is that the figures are not all the same height. The guys are WAY huger than the women and all the women are not the same. But other than that! It's worked out great!"
