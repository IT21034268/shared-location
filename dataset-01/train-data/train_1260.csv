3,Check your studs first,"I purchased this item based on the reviews and the size of my tv (50in). What I failed to do is check my stud locations before ordering. In my case, I have one stud in the middle of the wall and one on either side 16in away. The mount is not long enough to cover all three studs and I couldn't shift to one side or the other without being off centered. I ended up returning this and ordered the 690p which is about 5 inches longer. Was easy to mount. Make sure to check your stud locations first."
4,not what was in the picture,"Would of given it a 5, but this picture online is not what I recd. Though very similar. I loved how easy it was to mount over a stone wall. Up and running in 20 min. Dont read the manual. Anyone with a shred of commonsense can install this in no time. Great quality and enough srews and bolts to build a ship. Would recommend to everyone."
5,Great Product!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hands down, this is the right wall mount for a 42"" TV. Installation was a snap. You'll not be disapointed."
5,"Easy to install, sturdy and robust","I purchased this for a 42"" plasma TV. It was pretty easy to install and so far it has been very sturdy. It is flexible enough to support almost all TVs. Given its price, I highly recommend this."
3,average,I am not comfortable with the screws they sent to hold the plasma to the wall mount. The screws for the wall mount are solid steel screws and long enough to go into your studs and hold the bracket. The screws that attached the bracket to the back of the TV are some kind of composite metal. They look like they would snap easy. One snapped on me when I was screwing it in so I had to find another screw. It mounted and is still up to this day but I am leary to move the TV.
4,Works pretty well but...,"Holds up a TV. Worked great for years, but you better plug in all your cables ahead of time. There is no room to get your hands behind this thing when a TV is on it. Also best like the angle it is pointed. Get long screwdrivers to get it on and off too. Otherwise yes it was great!"
5,Great Wall Mount,"This Wall Mount was very easy to install and works very well to hold my Samsung 46"" flat screen. My wife and I were able to get the TV up on the wall in less than 30 minutes. I'd recommend this accessory to anyone."
4,Good Mount,"I recently used this product to mount my new JVC 42"" lcd tv. It weighs about 60 pounds or so. The mount itself seems to be very sturdy.Setup would have been a breeze if I was a better carpenter. Invest in a stud finder before embarking on this task.Basically you screw the plate to the wall, then you put the arms on your tv then you put the arms that are on you tv on the wall. It is that easy. The hard part is getting it level. Maybe not for someone else but for me it was. Also the tilting action works pretty good as well."
3,grant,"perfect for my 42"" plasma tv. comes with all the bolts that you will need to mount to tv and wall. its not the best on the market, but it is a very good one and you can't beat the price."
4,Nice mount from a trusted Company,"I do not know about some of you out there but I am not going to mount my $2000 plasma that wieghs over 80 pounds on a cheap walmart mount, this is a nice mount without a huge price tag.You should like it."
4,"Versatile, Easy to use","I used this to mount a 47"" LCD on a wall over a fireplace.One thing really amazed me about this product: the entire (wide) selection of mounting hardware comes in a long, compartmentalized plastic bag with labels on each section. You just find your TV on the list (or look online for an updated one) and choose bolts of the correct length and thread size.The mount itself sits very securely on the wall, and has a lot of flexibility in how and where it is mounted. I did miss having a center aligned hole or two for mounting with a stud in the middle - that's the only improvement I can think of."
4,good quality but doesnt match picture online,"Good, solid, easy to install wall mount but did not match the one in the picture. Also came with a ton of different bolts but did not have the correct size for my tv (46inch Sony Bravia LCD). Two sets of bolts were the correct width but one set was too short and one set too long, had to go to Home Depot to get correct size."
4,Great for the price!,"This is a great mount for the price! As the others have said, it doesnt quite look like the picture. My only complaint is that its not long enough to span 3 studs. Other than that the mount is superb."
5,really peerless,I first saw these when installing 14 flat panel displays on my job at a prison. it was very sturdily built and securely held the 42 inch display. So when I purchased a panel tv for home I searched the internet until I found it. So far I haven't used it as my wife wants to be sure of where she wants it before screwing it to the wall. I have looked at other brands and didn't find them to be of the same construction and when you hang 1000 dollars or more on the wall you want to be sure it stays there. Really simple installation and plenty of hardware no running to home depot for screws or anchors. I now have used it at home for another tv and it is great. Very Sturdy and thats just what you want when hanging that much weight on the wall. I have installed more than 15 of these now and the first went up just as easily as the last.
4,Good Price,This TV mount was easy to install and adjust but difficult if you have to add or raplace a cable. Too tight to the wall. Good price & quality.
3,Instruction manual,"The wall mount itself is fine and works as you would expect. Biggest problem was understanding the instruction manual (I think it was vague). One additional problem was that the hardware suggested for my plasma was incorrect, however by trial and error I found the appropiate pieces. The project was a success and I'm enjoying laying in bed watching my new panasonic."
5,"Simple install, Nice","For the money, this was an excellent buy. Everything comes with, other than the tools (screw driver, drill). This mount has the openings in the wall bracket that others don't, to allow for running cables thru the wall and directly in the back of the tv."
5,Great Wall Mount,"I purchased this wall mount with my Samsung HP-T5054 PDP. It is a very solid mount and the tilt mechanism works very smoothly. The only problem I had was when mounting it on the wall, the studs were not centered in the wall. This caused the mounting points to be far off to the left side of the mount. I had to reinforce the right side of the mount to keep it from pulling away from the wall under the weight of the tv. I do not think it is a fault of the mount, I am fairly positive I would have had the same problem with any mount. The mount comes with very detailed instructions and mounting hardware to work with just about any TV. The hardest part about hanging this mount and TV is finding the studs. Overall this is a very good product and I would highly recommend it."
4,"excellent mount, terrible masonry bolts","the mount is excellent. easy to adjust on the wall, minimum space required, ample hardware for different tvs, low price. BUT if installing onto masonry (i.e., grout between bricks on fireplace), do NOT use the supplied bolts and expanding toggles. they do not work (i now have 4 extra holes in my wall). i used tap-con screws, which have an odd but effective design to hold in masonry. they can be screwed into and out of the masonry multiple times and retain grip (not tear out grout)."
3,Measure wall studs before purchasing. This will only span 2.,"This wall mount is designed to only span 2 wall studs (16"" on center). The TV is centered on the wall plate, so for us that would have placed the TV 1 1/2 feet off center in the room. If you need to mount this across three wall studs for placement, get something from the ST670 line. We were passed our 30 days and couldn't return this to Amazon. However, Peerless was fantastic to deal with. Their online chat support and customer service reps RAWK! They sold us just the larger wall plate from the ST670 line (part number is 200-1901, about $48 with S&H)."
4,"Good bracket, go with a longer one for 50 inch TV's","Was disappointed with this bracket when I first looked at it, but after hanging it I am completely pleased with it.I have hung several friends TV's and this bracket has been the nicest of all of them, despite being the least expensive. The thin design allows the TV to lie closer to the wall then most brackets. The dowels in the pivot mechanism allows effortless positioning, that retains its position without restraint.The only downfall of this bracket is that if you are using it on a 50 inch TV, go with the model with that supports 60 inch displays (ST660)so that you can mount the TV to three studs vs two."
4,Good solid product,"Good wall mount. Very discreet. The TV looks great on the wall when held by this mount. Easy tilt adjustment for changing TV inputs around.The manual could use some improvement to explain offset mounting of the wall moount and TV if you don't have 3 studs 16"" apart. You may have to do some head scratching to figure out what is allowed (so that the warranty covers you, should your TV come crashing down)."
5,easy to hang,I am not very good with this kind of stuff but this was very easy to hang. I did not even use a level and it is straight.
3,Fear and Desire: The Debut of a Master,"FEAR AND DESIRE (1953)A little-known, rarely seen, low budget, Military Adventure film.Short, crudely edited, and with a crew of only 15 people, Fear and Desire is Stanley Kubrick getting to grips with his style. He later tried to prevent it from being screened, since he had little love for his debut.Fear and Desire is not extraordinary. Only a true Kubrick fan would love it.It's Kubrick, warming up for his greatness to come.P.S. I hope you enjoyed this short review, and read my other Kubrick reviews. Thanks!"
4,not bad,This book was not great or amazing but it wasn't bad either. I felt like it could have been about 150 pages shorter. Overall I'm not dissapointed I purchased it.
4,Interesting Book of Quotations,"""Have fun and learn at the same time!"" If you are interested in an amusing, fun-packed quotations' book, get this. It will also help you to stretch your imagination and develop wits. It won't hurt that you can read this on a beach."
4,Way better than Disney!!!,"I had to order a second copy because the first got scratched. Great in the car, in bed after books, or in the background. Beautiful soundtrack. I just wish they'd put several stories on one CD instead of just one, but it is 25 minutes. A nice gift."
4,Great Book,Great book. Book is dead on. Helped me care for my new hatchlings. Great reference book. Loved all the content.
4,NOT BAD !!!!!,"This mid ninetys tale of our favorite vigilante the Punisher is one that although looks all very samey as other pun man stories of the time it is quite a deep one and at the same time actioned packed. SEE !! the the punisher storm the kingpin of crimes HQ and shoot the ""@* clean out of it!!! (as it should happen and not like other stories where he is stopped or beaten!!!)The sorty by jim starlin who at the time had just before writen the exellent P o V limited series about the punisher returned to do this 2 part story of the pun man hunted by guilt over a criminals killing of a bus full of school children... this only the first part it is well worth getting the other book.... bit of a lost gem this for punisher fans"
1,Save Your Money,It's a list! It's a 658 page list of graduate schools in the United States - nothing more. If that's how you want to spend your money go for it!
5,Excellent book to read while traveling.,Great book! Each chapter reads like a separate short story which makes it perfect for traveling.
4,The Band relaxes and shares a few nice songs,"The Band / Stage Fright: This album has the hits ""The Shape I'm in"" and ""Stage Fright"". The rest of the album has the feeling of a band sharing the personal favorites that they enjoy performing more than the hits they have to do on stage. It is a more intimate album than their previous releases, but it is also less compelling than their previous releases. A four-star album that is worth having."
4,"Not as good as the first two, but still phenomenal","I couldn't give this album 5 stars because that would put it in the class of Big Pink and The Band...but in terms of its musical quality, it is still better than most. This album has often been put down by critics, but I think that's just because The Band had so much to live up to. This can by no means be called a slump...but just a move in a different direction. Stage Fright touches on some deep themes, such as betrayal (The Rumor), fear (Stage Fright), parenthood (All la glory)...but still leaves room for some fun (Time to Kill, Just Another Whistle Stop). it's another great Band album that doesn't dissappoint."
3,Correction to Editorial Reviews,"Richard Manuel does NOT sing ""Stage Fright"" on this cd. It is sung by the inimitable Rick Danko (may they both rest in peace)."
4,"Good, but not THAT Good","This is a good album, but it pales in comparison to ""Music From Big Pink"" or the self-titled ""The Band"".The sound represents a slightly darker side of The Band's career than the period of the first two albums. It is melodic, and musically well-done. But, it is dark (for The Band) and pessimistic. The sound is metallic-tinged and sharp. The words are certainly not jovial, and you can hear a distraught, hurt tone in many of the vocals. At the most peppy and spunky moments, its aura is at best ambivalent. This is not to knock this album, again I repeat, it is good musically. Just don't try to cheer yourself up with it.The best tracks in my opinion are Strawberry Wine, Time To Kill, The Shape I'm In, The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show, and Stage Fright."
2,Sad album,"There are some very pretty songs on this album but an incredible sadness comes through it all. I think the Band were in a bad period when they made this -- all three lead singers were shooting heroin and you can hear it in their voices, particularly Levon Helm's. Of all of the Band's albums, I find this hardest to listen to because it's the first time you can hear the damage that will eventually destroy them. The songs are much better heard as live versions on ""Rock of Ages"" and ""The Last Waltz."" And I think it's a mistake to say ""Not as great as the first two Band albums, but much better than any other music being made at the time."" 1970 was the year of ""After the Goldrush,"" ""Moondance,"" ""Layla,"" ""American Beauty,"" ""Plastic Ono Band,"" and a dozen other extraordinary albums. ""Stage Fright"" is not one of them."
3,A Baby Boomer's thoughts,"Don't be tricked by the title and the familiar cover design. This is not the entire original recording. Up on Cripple Creek, one of the best cuts on the original album, is missing from this one. What is there is the same old Band music, with its unique subject matter and funky beat, and is great for nostalgic listening, but I felt gypped when I found out my favorite cut was missing."
1,Dreadful,"I may have to request my money back from Blockbuster after renting this trite and boring documovie. Except for Paul Lekakis none of the cast is appealing and this is suppposed to be WeHo which is full of attractive people, however, none of them auditioned for this film. Very low budget and the story is riddled with cliches. Don't waste your time or money."
5,History,"The labor movement is part of our history as a country and of those who have struggled. Whatever the origins of the movement were, or said to be, labor songs and the spirit of the working man needs to be respected, studied and taught. Another great CD."
5,An Ancient African System of Enlightment,Ashby does an excellent job of selecting and highlighting pasages and unraveling the science of the soul.
4,Lectura del Rostro,"Its very intriguing, i read the information and made obsewrvations and the book is very accurate with people who i know that would mean that i can do the same with those who i dont know and i dont have to waste my time getting to know those that aren't worth it. the book is beyond interesting its factual."
3,It is a silly story with imagination.,Boys and girls will love this story because it is so funny. I am 7 years old and I really enjoyed it.
5,Absolutely adorable!!!,"I am a 24 y/o auntie and my 7 y/o niece read this book to me, it was absolutely adorable and hysterical!!!!"
4,"Nice easy reader book, good humor.","Lots of repeating words and then new words like, ""eat in the bathtub"" and ""sleep in the living room"" makes this a great book for a 1st grade reader. The illustrations are fun to look at. Has a couple sentences per page. This isn't my favorite book and I don't now if my 6 yr old son was totally convinced, but it has a lot of great beginning reader value."
1,Horrendous,"This book is a collection of unrelated ""expositary"" essays on current developments in science. The theme of ""mapping"" is forced and really doesn't work at unifying the chapters. The book has little or nothing to do with developments in computers or cartography. The author shows little comprehension of what he writes about, especially in the sections devoted to mathematics, and his original thought is fairly shallow. Don't expect it to come back in print."
2,Very basic,The writer of the book has written a rather boring book. What it is a series of interviews and stories about cartography in different fields. Nothing really very interesting. All very basic.
3,for action junkies?,Area 88 is about a young man who is a pilot and has his life stolenso that he thinks all he can do is be a mercenary pilotfighting a way in American aircraft against Soviet manufacturedaircraft. As this way pre-raytrace animations all the cells are drawn by hand in the animations.I don't think the attitudes in the movie are really very healthy for young people.It has a very black negative feel to it as a theme of death and betrayal.
2,Not at all pleased,I've had this phone (Red one) for two months and I'm very very disappointed. My last Sanyo phone I loved and the only reason I gave it up was because the flip top broke on the hinges and wasn't working properly. I have had nothing but troubles with this VI-2300 since I bought it. People I talk to constantly complain they cannot hear me when I can hear them just fine. The phone goes into Analog roam in places I never had Analog Roam before. The phone also drops calls.I took it back to sprint once already for repair and less than a month later it's doing what it was before.Not a happy customer!
1,its not a game its a controller..,only one of the controllers actually worked. to be more descriptive only one of the batteries can hold a charge so they sent me a faulty battery
2,Bad battery life but useful,This battery dies a lot quicker then my rechargeable. I got it because i could still use my good controller even when the batteries were dead because of the chord but it's annoying that i'm a casual gamer who plays at the most 2 hrs a day and the battery dies every day! At one point it is useful but at another point... Wtf? O_o
2,"Useful, but a poor investment","The play and charge kit is useful for converting your wireless controller into a battery saving wired controller. However, the battery provided is of poor quality. I bought two play and charge kits about 16 months ago; both are now dead. This was with moderate use, but with very little battery abuse. It would have cost less to buy throw away batteries for those 16 months.If you are looking to save on batteries you may want to look into buying a wired controller or a good set of rechargable batteries and recharger. Although both options are more expensive than buying the play and charge kit, they offer much more versatility (an extra controller, or lots of general purpose rechargable batteries)."
5,Satisfied,"I really can't complain about this thing, it straight rocks. I got it fast and without any hiccups so yeah I totally recommend it."
2,Worked great for a year... then died.,"I must say that this was a great product. I own a 360 and a PS3. I love the way the PS3 has the rechargable battery built into the controllers. Since 360 doesn't, this was the next best thing.It worked great for about a year, after that, the battery stopped charging and it would leave my 360 ""on"" when I tried to shut it down. It was trying to charge the now non-charging battery.I have yet to buy a new one since I can still use the controller by plugging the charging cable into the 360 and using it as a wired controller. The reason it is getting a low review by me is it should last for more than a year. Maybe I just got a bad battery, I will buy another one at some point though."
3,Works.. if you're lucky.,"Ordered it online and it stopped working within minutes of use. Had to buy another one at the store. Needless to say, there are other products that perform better."
4,Great accecorie,"It is really helpful when you are out of batteries and your batteries are low, expectially when you are in the middle of a xbox live fight or the middle of a game."
2,Great for about 5 months...,"I've had 3 of these official batteries and it seems like they don't last more than 4-5 months before they crap out... I don't even abuse them in any way, I'm a light gamer. The last battery I had lasted about 6 charges and I went the last month or so without going on my Xbox much. When I went to plug my play and charge kit back in the light would only stay red for a few seconds and then it would turn green like it was finished charging. When unplugged the controller will not start. Basically I have a wired controller now. I love when the thing actually worked but it seems to die way too quickly. Save your money and just get rechargeable AA batteries."
1,Uhh.... It's not supposed to be like this....,"I got my charge kit a couple days ago. Not only does it not charge if it's not plugged into the while it's on, but once I unplug it, it isn't charged. I've had the thing plugged in for over 24 hours, and still, the second I unplug it, nothin' doin'. Yeah, maybe I did get a defective unit, but read over the other reviews. Should there really be THAT MANY defective units that are distributed if this is really a ""quality"" product. Think twice about making this purchase if you don't want to deal with the hassle of having to receive it just to turn around and send it back for a new one."
1,Dead,"Bought this June of 2010. Not even a year since and the pack no longer recharges. I use the cord to power my controllers. That works fine but the battery packs are horrible. Even when charged, it was constantly warning me of a low battery half way through the charge. Very annoying when playing a game to see the xbox button flashing in my face. I treat my stuff like gold and cycle batteries properly. This pack has ended up being worse than my rechargeable batteries. I can't recommend this item. I'm probably going back to lithium until they make a rechargeable battery that actually has a decent shelf life."
5,Xbox 360 Play And Charge Kit,"A MUST HAVE, IF YOU HAVE A WIRELESS CONTROLLER. Why go out and spend money on batteries over and over when you can spend 20 bucks for this and never pay for batteries for an 360 controller again. This isnt a waste of money, you need it. I got it for christmas and its really good. Just plugs into the top of your controller along with the new battery, then the other side plugs into the front of your Xbox, thats it. Get it!"
2,Black Play & Charge Kit?,"The picture shows a white/gray play & charge kit. However, I received a black play & charge kit. My controller is white not black!!"
5,A must need,"IF you are a hard core gamer like me then this is a must need. When i first bought the 360 i got suckered in to buying this for my controler by the store clerk and you know what iam glad i bought it. WIth out the play and charge kit you have to constantly change out batteries every few hours, but with the play and charge kit i just have to wait for the controler to die plug this thing in and bam iam back in the game with out having to look for new batteries for minutes on end and it will save you alot of money in the long run. YOU have to buy this in order to play 360 constantly and also if you have four controlers for if buddies come over buy it for those controlers too. yes i know the 360 only has two usb ports but if your like me i have a computer too so you can plug two more in those usb ports. but if you dont then you can always revert back to batteries until yall are done then you can recharge the controlers over night."
4,MUST READ NOTE TO AVOID THE 360 FROM OVERHEATING!!!,"BUT MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS PLUGGED IN! EVEN WHEN YOU TURN THE CONSOLE OFF, THE 360 CHARGES THE BATTERY PACK. IT WILL CONTINUE TO UNTIL YOU TURN ON AND OFF YOUR CONOLE WITH THE CHARGE KIT OUT. IF YOU DON'T, YOUR 360 WILL OVERHEAT FROM BEING ON SO LONG AND HAVING TO POWER YOUR BATTERY PACK.Now to the acutal review:The charge kit is great because there is no need to constantly replace batteries. The cord can be plugged into the xbox 360's USB port, and it has the length so that you can play it at the same time. No need for expendable batteries anymore! The battery in the controller can recharge totally off the Xbox 360."
1,Faulty device,There are day when i plug it in and it charges the battery and then there are days it just wont charge the batter
3,Charge time is too slow,"Since this charger charges via usb the charge time is a little slow, you can conect the cable to a computer or charge it y while you play...I didnt give it five stars or four because i never seen completly charge, never seend the light of the cable turn green or turned off...The battery can lats like a week charged playing two hours daily, if it was me i would pay alittle more and go for the XBOX 360 QUICK CHARGE KIT that can cahrge teo batteries at once...also agood thing of the play and charge kit it comes with a batterie"
5,Love it!,I wish I got this sooner than later. It is a great battery charger and works while you play. It is a must for XBOX users! I highly recommend it!
4,Definitely works...,"To have it charge when the Xbox is off you have to turn the Xbox on first, then you can turn it back off.Also it DOES NOT work with a PC like a wired controller. The computer detects it but is unable to actually use it. You have to buy an adapter (get the $17 one) or a wired controller.Otherwise great product, no more batteries."
1,"Never use this,","you are better off purchasing a batter charging station, because this is just a pain to use and take away the whole point of having a wireless controller."
1,Break All The Time,"These things break all the time. Just do a search for ""Play & charge not charging"" and you can see how widespread a problem it is. It comes with warranty but you'll give up after paying for shipping a few times. These things break all the time. There's no fix. These things are an f'ng pain in the ass waste of cash and micros*** doesn't care and they will never spend the resources needed to make it a solid product."
4,Charge kit,"Works as advertised, the only thing I wanted it to have is the possibility to charge the battery with the console turned off. I don't know if this actually happens but at least the charging LED doesn't turn red when the Xbox is off."
1,"PS3 did it right, WATS UP M$?","i dont understand why this is so hard to do, i know the xbox is a outdated piece of equipment but jeez, bad enuff i have to pay for something my ps3 already has, now the junk doesnt work properly...M$ you fail, FAIL FAIL!! ps3 you have my loyalty, quality is what matters and anything that has the microsoft name on it is NOT quality. if it wasnt for mass effect i wouldnt own a xbox, and wouldnt need to buy a wire and rechargeable batteries when a NEXT GEN SYSTEM should have this stuff included!"
1,"Its a waste of time, dont burn your money.","Do not purches this, its a good theary and all but your jist makeing a wireless controler wired and giveing your self a bigger pain to deal with. Purches the Quick Charge Kit, it comes with the rechargibal battery and is way less of a hassel."
2,"Wrong color, overpriced, and damaged package.","This is probably a failure on my part, but after purchasing the product, I noticed other sites were selling it for much cheaper. When I received my product, there were 2 issues:1. The picture in the product description page is of a white Play & Charge Kit and I received a black one. I wanted white since my controller is white.2. The box that the product was in was damaged. It looked like someone tried to crumple the box and tear it in half.I'm giving this 2 stars because I had a poor experience with the the pricing, packaging, and product color. I didn't open the damaged box to see if the product worked."
3,Better idea than product,I like the idea of the plug in cable because you can still use the controller and play while the battery charges. Unfortunately the battery doesn't always charge. Multiple times I have gotten a green light on the cable (battery charged) only to unplug it and have the controller turn off because it has a low battery. When I plug it in again the green light comes back on. The length is good though easy to play while plugged in. The charging capabilities though are the main point of the cable.
2,Great when it worked,"I ordered two of these for my wireless controllers. At first I loved them. They charged all the way up and lasted almost as long as AA's. After like 4 months however they began only charging to 2 bars and ran out very quickly. I prefer using regular batteries now, since they last so much longer. I would not reccommend these."
3,"Works, no charge while Xbox off","Works to recharge your xbox powerpacks when still in the controller, BUT will not charge them while the xbox is off. To fully recharge a pack, you have to leave the xbox on overnight, thus wasting lots of electricity."
1,silly little product,"i gave it a generous extra star on the ""funness"" factor-if you like to play wired. like the 5-star reviewers said you can indeed charge the controller while the xbox is off. i consider myself a technologically adept person and pretty sure that i've figured out the proper way of using it. however when this silly little product gives the ""ok light"" that it's done charging, one would obviously unplug it. about a half hour of playing time later...time to plug it back in, the battery is shot!! the only reason that i have this is because it came with the fabulous green xbox (halo edition). but for this...don't waste ur money. by someEnergizer NH15BP-4 ACCU 2500mAh Rechargeable AA Batteries (Four-pack)that microsoft arrogantly ""does not recommend"" in their xbox user manual."
5,Good idea,It's a great idea to have this for when your battery dies in the middle of a match. It's easier to plug this in than hunt for two new batteries.
5,great product,this is a great product.well worth the cost unless you love spending money on batteries every other day.
2,Good While it Lasted,This was good for when I first bought my XBOX 360 and it charged fast and even while I was playing so I could avoid an inconvenience. The cord is an o.k. length and playing while charging is nice though the cord can be a downer. In about 3 or 4 months the problems came and the battery held no charge and no matter how long I left it plugged in it didn't matter. While I had it I found it better than buying batteries but for what I payed it doesn't seem like I got my monies worth. Some people had good luck and for those I am happy but this item didn't hold its worth for me.
1,"Short Life, Waste of Money","While the Play & Charge kit seems like a good idea, and works well at first, I'd have to say it was a waste of money.I have three of these, and after about 6 months of light use each battery pack gets less than an hour of gameplay per charge. I end up having to keep them plugged in almost constantly - only two controllers can be charged simultaneously, so if you're playing 4-player halo, chances are someody's battery pack is gonna go dead and be unable to charge at some point.You can buy a lot of AA's for ~$18, they're more reliable, and last tons longer.If you don't want to buy batteries, buy a wired controller; if you want wireless, buy a big pack of AA's at costco."
4,Great product,"This charger is very convenient to have for your wireless controller. It charges the battery pack pretty fast when idle (longer when in use). If you have a rechargeable battery pack, this item is a must have."
4,I got my money's worth,"I bought the Xbox play & Charge kit for my brothers. According to them, if you have a wireless controller, they would highly recommend it because if the battery on your controller dies, you can simply get the cable and connect it to your controller and keep on playing. The only downside is that if you are playing while charging it, it takes longer than charging it alone. They would higly recommend it though."
1,Overpriced and a Waste of Money,"Like all Xbox 360 accessories, the Play & Charge Kit is over priced. I have never been unsatified with a video game accessory until I bought this piece of garbage. It works fine the first few times I used it. Except for the fact that it took more than 6 hours to charge. Then it broke. The light would constantly stay green saying the battery is charge even when I just plugged it in. My controller wouldn't work unless it was plugged in using the play & charge kit. Rather than buying this, buy the Quick Charge Kit which is only 10 dollars more and very reliable."
3,Simply unimpressed with charge time...,"It works, it just takes way too long. I'm buying the quick charge kit."
1,Only the Cord,I ordered this expecting it to come with everything I need to play endless games without having to worry about changing the batteries. This is only a cord to charge the controller. It does not come with a rechargeable battery pack and so you will have to buy that separate. I returned the item and have not tried for another one since. I do not even know if it will do anything at all if you do not have a rechargeable battery pack with it since normal batteries don't just recharge themselves.
5,more beautiful in person,The Copper Funnel Rain Chain looks even more beautiful hung by my front porch than I expected. The photos don't do it justice.
5,One of the best books by Ulitskaya,"One of the best books by Ulitskaya, strongly recommend it to anyone interested in modern Russian literature."
3,Two-thirds a good read,"I am not sorry I read ths book. Venables is a fine writer--one of the best in his genre working today. Having read one too many accounts of the Everest region (and a number of books on the west, K2, region), I appreciate Venables's description of the less-written-about middle Himalaya. The writer's account of the Panch Chuli climb itself is also fine.Unfortunately, after Venables's accident, there is little left to sustain the narrative. He simply sits around in his tent with his two partners, discussing food and British lit., waiting for the helicopter to come rescue him. In reality, I'm glad his rescue was easier than, say, Joe Simpson's was in Peru, but it makes for some rather boring reading.To sum, the book is well worth reading, but expect a let down around two-thirds of the way through."
3,Difficult to read,"Overall, I found this book to be a good look into Himilayan climbing. My only complaint was that it was written in British English and is a little difficult to read. The climbing terms are a little techincal as well. Being a non-climber, I sometimes can't picture what the author is describing when using climbing lingo.Beyond that, it seems like a good book, not quite like Karkauer's or Boukreev's books."
2,Nice improvement. But didn't last long.,"I bought this router because I was looking to improve the distance and signal in the large house I was renting. I didn't notice much of an improvement with the non SRX400 enhanced cards that I had in my laptops. But when I bought the card, it made all the difference. Works great! Improved the signal and performance significantly.Update:This product worked well at first but did not last long (about a year) before I started having problems and bought a new and different model."
2,Faulty router with web utility config issues,I bought this router and since day one I had problems in accessing the configurations through the web utility. Linksys support's suggestions didn't work. I researched the problem and noticed that a lot of other people were having issues in accessing the router configurations through the web utilitiy. I problably had a faulty router to begin with. Anyhow I send it back for a refund.
2,"This is the Toonces of routers - it routes, just not very well","I probably should have gone with an older model. This models drops the wireless connection every 30 minutes (up from 12 minutes before we turned off IEEE 802.1X authentication). I wish the problems were catastrophic - try getting support for something that ""kinda works""."
4,Sure Beats old B wireless router,"Got the new SRX400 router and matching laptop card for Christmas. Had a defective install CD, but was able to download and updated version off the Linksys website. Range and speed is soooo much better than the Wireless B with Booster that I had previously. Have had no problems."
2,"Easy Setup, poor wireless reliability","Pros:Was able to quickly setup the device and enable the WPA security features.Web interface was clean and easy to use.Cons:Device has to be reset regularly to re-enable wireless connectivity for wireless clients.Yellow plastic covering used to label the ethernet ports prevents the network cables from ""latching"" properly.I am hopeful that the wireless reliability will be fixed in firmware updates, currently using Firmware Release Version 1.00.10 released on 11/21/2005."
3,good router for G wi fi,"light weight, smallgood range, fast speed.most important very easy to setup....."
4,Linksys WRT54GX4 Wireless-G Broadband Router with SRX400,It was easy to setup and install . Had it up and running in about 10 mins
2,fast but incompatible,"Previously used a d-link 624, which worked well with all my devices but had limited range.Bought this based on reviews here as having good range (mimo), which it did, even with channel bonding turned off (so as not to clobber everything for my neighbors).Unfortunately, it had serious incompatibility problems. Would not maintain connection (WPA/WPA2 TKIP+AES) with PlayStation 3 or with my Cingular 8525 (HTC tytn), and had intermittent problems with my toshiba tecra M5 and dell m700, both with internal wireless mini-pci cards (not sure which chipsets).Returned it.Bought a buffalo WHR-HP-G54 instead and everything works great."
3,Works like an average wireless router,I bought this router after reading about MIMO technology and all that claiming that it provides better siganl quality and greater coverage area. It didn't notice much difference compared to my old beat up D-Link DI-514 router for which I paid 9.99. I was looking for a router that would actually give better signal qulaity and strength and also my old router was lacking WPA and WPA2 security. Besides the security aspect it didn't seem to offer a big advantage in terms of signal quality and/or strength.
4,very good,got it a week back. works as well as stated. excellent range. dosent drop signals and very fast. Also easy to set up and configure. Overall an excellant purchaseI am giving an update to my earlier review. This thing stopped working after a month. It just froze up and wont respond to anything (not even unplugging it). You cannot change the subnet address which restricts remote access when using a VPN connection. Customer service kept me on hold for ever and then had my call dropped. Terrible waste of money. Avoid at all costNow if only there is some way to change my initial 4 star rating to a 1 star ...
4,Excellent Product-required a firmware update,I highly recommend this router. Although set up was a bit difficult for me and required Linksys tech support to deal with set up problems. I will say my experience with Linksys tech support ( from India) was helpful and solved my problem. The problem was this router needed a firmware update. I was experiencing connectivity issues with my DSL provider. Once I received the firmware update I was good to go! I have been using this router for the last 3 1/2 months and have had no issues. I highly recommend this product!
4,Nice design - but drops wireless connections,"Update: After using this for a while, I noticed that the router keeps dropping the laptop wireless connection for no reason. I tried the latest firmware upates and all of the tech support recommended tweaks to the settings. I tried changing to new channels, disabling certain features, just about everything you can imagine. Nothing worked to keep this router from dropping the connection. It seems that when Cisco technology merged with Linksys technolgy, new bugs were introduced. I am getting rid of this one and going back to the classic blue WRT54GL. Reliability is most important."
1,Very disappointed in product and technical support,"After much effort to get this installed and working, it works marginally at best. Technical support was and is also marginal, handicapped perhaps by English being a second language.I was naive and thought I could get the kinks worked out, and by doing so, missed the window to return it. I am glad other buyers have had good luck with the product, wish I would have."
1,Dissatisfied,"Unfortunately I received a defective unit and after spending endless hours with Linksys technical support, which incidentally is very good, the diagnosis was that it was not working properly and the drop rate was to high. I returned it for a full refund and ordered a D-Link 655."
1,Dropped Connections,"This product does not earn a rating. I purchased two new units and experienced identical problems with connections dropped every few minutes. Two different IT professionals could not make it work. The Linsys Tech assistance, although courteous could not help. Shame on Linsys for marketing such merchandise."
2,Please read before buying - router has issues,"I have always had linksys routers without any problems; in fact, I am currently using the WRT54GS. I purchased this router because I felt that having the added range would be beneficial - WRONG!!!This router is wonderful to setup from the box and when it decides that it's going to work, has great range. However, the router kept disconnecting from my wireless devices pretty regularly. I was no longer able to take my laptop throughout my house as I used to because it would disconnect. I contacted linksys and the only option they gave me was to change the channel, which I went through all of them to no avail. I have since gone back to using my old router which works wonderfully.This technology is still way too new and Linksys needs to work out the bugs in it before releasing it to the public."
5,Wireless-G Broadband Router,"Slim, great price, better than any product I researched in office supply stores or PC stores. I highly recommend this product. I can use my laptop anyhere in the house and in my backyard."
4,It's good except drops connections,"I have used the router for about a month and was really easy to set-up. Setting up Mac filtering was easy and all the other security features. The only problem with it is when you first start you computer it keeps dropping and reconnecting to the laptop, especially if you more than one wireless connection. There might be a fix for this but I haven't found it yet. I have updated to the latest firmware version, but it doesn't seem to help."
5,Valuable Reference for Mystery Fafns,"This book is mainly an alphabetical checklist of mystery books arranged by author, such as Agatha Christie, Dick Francis, John Rhode, Conan Doyle, etc. It includes a valuable author name index that cross-references pseudonyms and a main character index for those of us who remember the detective's name but have no clue about the author or title. The book also lists many alternate titles for the same work, eliminating costly duplicate purchases. Mass market paperback. 234 pp. with short introduction by the author."
4,puppy shampoo,"Great shampoo for my dogs. Quite expensive, but lasts well over a year for my two small dogs. Like that it isn't full of chemicals. Keeps their coats quite soft."
4,Fantastic,This CD is truly an unheralded gem. I was fortunate to see this album performed live and the CD certainly captures the essence of the live performance. A truly enjoyable album.
3,Not exactly the play but close,"Actually, this 1927 Alfred Hitchcock version of Noel Coward's play is close to the book but annoying having to keep up with the screen cards. They do not look like they match the verbiage. In addition, this version is much darker than the newer film version. I suggest you read the play first.We start with the trial and flash back to where a woman (Isabel Jeans) hides her sordid past from her new husband and family.We learn what easy virtue really means.A fun sideline is trying to figure out where you have seen the actors before.Easy virtue,: A play in three actsEasy Virtue [Blu-ray] ~ Jessica Biel"
2,Not up to date,"I have had a copy of this book since it came out. I keep hoping to get an electronic copy. I am Cherokee. Where in the book does it tell about Tahlequah, Oklahoma? This is the center of the Oklahoma band of the Cherokee. This is where the Cherokee National Holiday is celebrated. It states that Sequoia developed the Cherokee written language. His name was really Soquili. Check the book ""Tell them they lie"" written by Traveler Bird, a decendant of Soquili. More research needs to be done."
1,not recommended,"The title is misleading.very few definitions.words like french,furniture, fur trading.some information doe's not check out to be correct."
4,A historical document and beautiful performances,"The earlier reviewer is quite correct about the subfusc sound on this recording; but these are historic performances by the Czech Philharmonic, on visits to London in the late thirties, under a very young Szell and Kubelik (aged 30 and 24, respectively). While the transfer is not of the best quality--hence the limited recommendation--it is very serviceable, and the music registers clearly. Some years ago, a radio co-host and I played part of this disc on air (the Largo from the New World Symphony, conducted by Szell) and the listeners loved it; we got lots of calls in response to this selection. The two excerpts from ""Ma Vlast"" under Kubelik are similarly eloquent. While not everyone cares for ""vintage"" music performances, these communicate very vividly to anyone with a taste for the sound of 78's."
2,"Good performance, lousy sound.","Don't know the year, but this sounds pre-stereo, with very muffled sound. Still, Szell is Szell... ."
2,Little pieces,"This bracelet fell apart as soon as my daughter put it on. I contacted the seller via Amazon's email contact and got no reply whatsoever. It wasn't expensive or anything, so it's not that big of a deal, it's just the principle."
5,"Fabulous production, and very informative","This is a very good start for kids to begin learning about literature, and how to appreciate it better. My kids were ahead of their class when they finally started literature lessons, and I think they owe it to this wonderful program. The version I got included a ""What's A Good Story"" program, which helps young viewers analyse the story more deeply, and teach them basic concepts in literature such as ""metaphor"", character development, etc. I would strongly recommend this highly-educational and entertaining video to any parent."
1,Pet Swabs - Ear Relief Wash Swabs,"I used these for years before my local shops stopped carrying them. Was happy to find them on Amazon, but very disappointed when they arrived. The solution (clove oil and other agents) was dried out - fresh, good swabs have the solution filled in the stem of the swab. Nothing. Dried up. Evaporated. Useless.These are wonderful swabs when fresh. Useless when old and dried out.Very disappointed."
5,dutch pride,Listening to Erna Spoorenberg made me a proud Dutchman Her beautifull voice matches the beauty of the composition. She is my Dutch Pride Brava!! Ernst Daniel Smid
3,Lots of Fun,"A far-fetched fantasy comedy that works. I truly enjoyed this tongue-in-cheek fantasy comedy. It's the same old story...what if you make a wish and it comes true? You'll need to face the music. And that's what this is all about. Nothing serious here...just fun...just lots of fun, fun, fun."
1,Over hyped,"What is up with all the hype. This movie sucked. BIG TIME. And what is with all the reviews about Peggy Black, aka Jane Braugh? Ms. Braugh -- don't quit your day job."
4,"Great DVD, but it has some annoying DRM!","This documentary was a wonderful piece of work chock full of amazing interviews, photos, and vintage footage that makes you feel like you're right in the middle of the legendary black artist movement. I enjoyed this documentary thoroughly because not only was it a wonderful political account, it was also an incredible history of early black cinema as well. This documentary is a must for anyone with a general interest in early to mid 20th century black history.The big problem with this dvd is it takes full use of an irritating DRM technology called UOP prohibition that will stop you from fast forwarding certain parts of the dvd. Commercials, logos, etc. all unskippable, you can't even use the stop button. The only way to stop the player is to shut it all the way off with the power button. I was really, really surprised to see this nasty drm on such a great dvd. I have other BET Starz dvds and they aren't as annoying."
5,A really Great Drama,A Strong movie with a great cast. Not too many years ago the world was very different and this movie tells the story as it was. You get involved in the inequalities of that era and of how people suffered because of prejudice.
1,AWFUL,This was an awful movie that had no point and was extremely boring. Don't see it! unless its just to make noise in the background while you do something thats going to be worth ur time. i hate it i hate it i hate it! note: it doesnt even derseve one star!
4,tight film,this Movie for it's time frame was Ground-Breaking.in 1971 to be doing a Movie with a Black Actor&White Female Lead was Big.well sorry to say it still is in 2001.James Earl Jones was Good as Jack Johnson.but I'd dig a New up-dated take on it.anyway The Soundtrack was a Knock-Out.Miles Davis&His Band went the full 15 Rounds.this Film has a Cool Pace&isn't like many other films for that Reason alone.It's History seldom mentioned.
4,Great Music. It's the only 2 LP's on one CD.,This is great perplexingly complex RIO style progressive rock but be aware that this CD is the 2 very fine LP's this group put out I believe in the 80's on vinyl put back to back on 1 CD. No bonus stuff. No new stuff. Great stuff though.
2,broken but it works,the top was cracked but it still works. The bolt that goes through the top must have been over tightened in testing since the crack is right where the anchor for the threading is.
5,Wonderful,"I love this book, and couldn't find it in Italy. It was delivered very soon and I love the hardcover edition. Thank you!"
3,Silly story,"Yes, it's a silly story but it is supposed to be silly. I saw the movie some time ago and thought it was hokey too. The story is pretty well written. It's also pretty short and the Kindle download is pretty cheap. I kinda got tired of the constant use of profanity. I'm not offended by ""offensive"" language, I just get bored with it when it becomes excessive. Sometimes I get the feeling that writers use excessive profanity as filler when they can't come up with anything else to have their characters say. I'd like to read more by the author just to see how he can handle a story with a little more meat and purpose. Apparently he has a fair amount of writing available to check out."
3,"Fair album. There are better places to start with Seger such as ""Mongrel.""","Fair album. Many of the albums on either side of this are a bit stronger, because the artist felt the need to release a covers album. His covers aren't the best covers in the world, but they are ok and somewhat stronger than the originals featured on this CD. ""Someday"" is not a strong original, but ""Bo Diddley"" is a great cover version of an already amazing song. ""Let it Rock"" seems to dwarf Seger's own ""Heavy Music,"" which is featured here in its original 1966 lo-fi version. Out of place, the track is worthwhile, but would be better served on a compilation. Some of the highlights of this album are featured on ""Early Seger,"" and rightfully so-""Carpenter"" contains a great Seger vocal. Missing, though, from ""Early Seger"" is ""Bo Diddley,"" and the searing ""Let it Rock,"" which was bettered on ""Live Bullet."" Mixed bag, but not bad."
4,Still Burning,"Seeger's covers album was my favourite Seeger for no other reason than the awesome power he delivers on those three opening tracks;McDaniel's 'Bo Didley/ Who Do You Love', the Stephen Still's anthem,'Love The One Your With'and a yearning, mournful rendition of Tim Hardin's,'If I were A Carpenter'. He got smoother as he 'progressed'into acceptability. Give me this raw passion any day! Using a cobra snake as a necktie, honey. Tell me. Who do you love? Bo never said it better. This is pretty seductive rhetoric, Bobby. I believed you back then."
3,In the Pop Seat,Don't throw out your copy yet. This CD contains 3 classics that shouldn't be overlooked...unfortunately the rest plays like a poor mans Chicago.The best here are...1. Hand Of Truth2. Dylans - Man In The Long Black Coat3. Street War
2,on the toilet seat,i've been a fan of this band since damn near day one. what were they thinking when they released this?
2,Fun but not for long,"My kids enjoyed playing with this toy for the first few days after it came. Since then it is not getting much attention. I am expecting this to be used on and off by kids. It will be especially used when their friends come visiting.Though nothing has been broken, but judging from feel, the construction could have been sturdier."
3,Wish they would've left this toy alone,"I remember the Sit N Spin from my own childhood, without the lights and music - just a simple toy my friends and I had fun with, based on it's concept.Now, it has become another electronic nightmare - with nonstop music, no on/off switch for the music, no volume controls...all the noise adds nothing to the concept of the toy whatsoever. The music is LOUD and seems to go non-stop if the child even glances at they toy!My daughter (21 months) seems to enjoy it - although she ends up throwing it around the room as much as sitting on it. I think it will be a fun toy for her as time goes on, and for her parents once the batteries wear out!"
5,Wonderful toy,"My mother bought this toy for my son when he was 1 year old. He is a quick learner so she was happy to help him advance.This toy is wonderful for music with the younger children as well as the 18 month old.He loves to hit the top and play all the music. He is almost 2 years old and is spinning his little heart out. This is out of all the toys he has, his favorite.Buy this toy you will not be dissapointed."
1,"New and improved? Yeah, right!","I just put this together for my 3-yr-old, who was very excited to be getting his own. He plays with one of the original type Sit N Spins at preschool and loves it. However, this ""new and improved"" version is a piece of junk. The support that connects the top to the base unit is made of cheap plastic and has way too much give in it to effectively get a good spin going. My son can really make the old one spin quickly, but with this one it's useless. He complained that it's too slow and gave up on it within about two minutes. It will be definitely be returned."
5,My 12 month old loved it!!,"My son got this toy for his 1 year birthday and he loved it! At first he just hit the buttons for the music, but he learned how to spin it himself by 14 months and he just can't get enough. Yes, the music is loud and somewhat obnoxious, but its not like it is so bad that you can't deal with it. I have heard toys louder than this one! It gives his such giggles to spin around and around which I found children at this age really like to do."
2,can be hazardous,"Our 15 month old daughter loves her sit and spin, LOVES IT!. We didn't put batteries in it because we read the complaints about the music. She used it every day. The problem is that whenever we go to move it, the top hand wheel pops off, so you have to pick it up by the entire base. Lesson learned, easy fix, just use more care. Until last night, when she was gleefully smiling and spinning, the hand wheel popped off, and she banged her head on the floor. My baby's not much of a crier, but boy did she cry after that! I may try the liquid nails that another person recommended, because she loves this toy sooo much. Just be aware of the hazard!"
3,1 is too young for a toy like this.,"My son got this toy for Christmas from his Grandmother, and he doesn't have any interest in it. He does play the music on occasion, but doesn't like to sit on it, just spins it with his hand. This toy is more like for ages 2 and up."
1,The music never stops!,It is true my daughter LOVES this toy. And it is even more true that it drives me crazy! There is no on-off switch and the music goes on and on... my daughter enjoys walking past it and just hitting the top and making the music play. It is loud and very bothersome. I think it was my sister's way of getting me back for all the irritating gifts I have given her kids.
4,for very small kids only,"I was excited about this toy till I noticed some of the concerns in the reviews. I'm sure this toy is fine for very small kids but I remember our kids using it when they were 10 or older. (They were petite girls.) I thought this would be great for kids who were ADHD. The old Sit and Spin was great for helping get some of the energy out.Notice the size of the box and the weight.Box Size (in inches): 18.6 x 18.1 x 3.9Shipping weight: 4.4 pounds.Four pounds! Come on! At four pounds, it can't be very sturdy.If the box is just 18.6 inches wide, how small is the toy! I imagine it is about 15 inches wide.They didn't need to add the music. They should have put that cost into making the toy bigger and more sturdy.Maybe they will start making the old one again. Pay a little more for the ""Sit and Spin Classic."" That would be a great idea."
2,JJ's mom,This sit and spin has no off switch and is very sensive to motion. It plays music and lights up at very in appropirate times with little stimulation. It also takes up a concerable amount of space in our small home.
4,Fun and Durable,"I recommend this item. We have owned one for several years. My children (ages 8, 5 & 4) still enjoy playing with it. It barely even looks worn. The sometimes like to just dance to the music. This was a worthwhile purchase. A great gift, in my opinion!!"
4,"fantastic toy, but older version was sturdier (and bigger)","My husband and I were so excited to give our 18 month old a sit n spin for Christmas. Growing up, we had both loved sit n spin! But, when we put the toy together we were somewhat dissapointed.Is it just us, or did this toy get much smaller? Both of us thought the sit n spin shrunk. Also, it seemed much flimsier than I remember my blue sitnspin that I had back in the 80's. I remember using this toy as a much older child making me think it was bigger back then.Overall this is still a great toy!! Our toddler is just getting the hang of it, but I know he'll be spinning on it for hours someday. I think the music is cute, and the batteries can always be removed if you don't like it.The big dissapointment is the small size and flimsyness of the item! Our son barely fits on it. I think it cold get alot more use by kids (and adults!!!) if it was larger."
3,Sit n Spin is back!,"I remember when I used to have this. It's cool that it has music and all but my 2 year old got this as a gift in August and she has stopped playing with it already. It is now used to help build castles and forts. The top part of the toy comes out with a nice pull, don't know if it's supposed to do that. Doesn't seem very sturdy. It was a hit when they first got it. Especially for my 5 year old, but it's popularity has dwindled."
3,TOO LOUD!!!!,"Put me in the ""bring back the classic toy"" camp. Why the digital dance mix? My husband and I get the songs stuck in our heads worse than the Wiggles tunes-- especially the ""everybody dance now"" riff-- just terrible! The durability is nowhere near what it was for the one I had as a child {old blue as I like to remember it}-- I think I rode on that thing until I was at least eight years old and it never waivered! The center turn wheel on this thing looks like it may break off with just the manipulations of my two-year-old.We have taken out the batteries, though, to end the tortured wail of ""dadadadadadum"" {William Tell Overture} that we were hearing constantly. Good God- how much can one set of sleep-deprived parents stand? Can anyone say ""over-stimulation""????"
2,The music will drive you crazy.,"I fondly remember the sit 'n spin from my own childhood. I got it for my son last year for Christmas. He's 2 1/2 now and enjoys it more than he did last year. However, the music is loud and quite annoying. It also triggers quite easily when other toys in the toybox shift around. I think it will work in silent mode without the batteries, which I may try soon. I hate to be a killjoy, but I just can't listen to those those cheesey tunes anymore."
3,It's an okay toy.,I bought the rockin' tunes sit and spin for my son and he loves. He was 17 months old when he got it and it took about 2 weeks for him to figure it out. He's now almost two and this is still one of his favorite toys and he plays with almost everyday. He loves to push the top to make the music and lights come on. I do not like this toy much myself. Amazon describes it as playing 9 different songs but it only plays 6. The songs it does play are not any of the ones in the description. The music is very loud and annoying after a while. I think Amazon put the same description from the classic sit and spin on this one. (...)
3,Not Impressed,"We purchased this toy for my daughter's 3rd birthday because she loved to play on an older sit 'n spin they had at one of her playclasses. I really don't mind the loud music, though I wish it had a volume control or off switch at times. However, my daughter is only 30lbs and she has a very difficult time making the toy spin around. Her arms are tired just after spinning it around 3-4 times. I watch her work very hard and after a few minutes she just gives up and stops playing with it. We never had this issue with older versions of the toy."
4,An update to a classic toy,"For her second birthday our daughter received this ""Sit 'n Spin"". At first I wasn't sure if she was ready for it, but she proved me wrong (again). Almost immediately she sat down on the disk and started spinning. Then she promptly stood up on the disk and went flying across our living room.She really enjoys her sit 'n spin especially the sounds. One warning though, the songs play for at least 30 seconds. So they can be annoying when your child just wants to keep pressing the buttons."
2,too noisey!,"The original Sit and Spin worked just fine, why did they have to add music to it? NOt only that but it is bad music and there is no off switch for the music feature. THe sit and spin part works great but turn off the noise!!"
2,does not spin well,"We recently purchased a sit n spin for our 2 year old son. The plastic base is flimsy and seems unable to support his weight. Unless situated just perfect my son is unable to spin. The base rubs against the floor. My son is the height and weight of a 3 year old but when he uses my old sit n spin at my parents house, he spins much faster. I agree with others that there should be an off/on switch and toy is not that durable."
4,Great toy once you put tape over the speaker,I swear they make the decibal level so loud that kids will go deaf! This toy is very annoying with how loud it is. I combatted that with putting tape over the speaker holes. I swear. . .can they just make a toy nowadays that isn't electronic or makes noise or doesn't need batteries! What happened to the plain old sit and spin? Instead they have to add annoying music to it!
1,"LOUD, obnoxious, easy 2 fall when stepped on, easy spills","The classic sit 'n spin was so wonderful! PLEASE TRY THIS IN THE STORE BEFORE YOU BUY! Don't be fooled, as we were, into thinking the 'music' was not too loud. We tried the music in the store (TRUs) before buying, but discovered, when in use at home, that a toy store environment must be very loud. In addition to the VERY loud, obnoxious music (even our 3-yr. old daughter still covers her ears, and that's with clear packing tape over the speaker), it is very, very easy for children to fall when they step on this toy (and that's the 1st way they usually try to get on it). As a consequence, VERY CLOSE SUPERVISION is needed for playdates and children under the age of 5. Children also tend to lean backward while trying to use arms to spin, and this often results in the SNSpin toppling over. Our child's lighweight (3 yrs., 30 lbs.), but heavier friends have experienced the same high-risk issue. BUY IT WITHOUT THE MUSIC, if you can find it."
4,Still fun after all these years!,"Sit N' Spin is still a great toy! Durable, easy to clean, and fun for a wide range of ages. My daughter got this as a gift at age 4 or 5, and she still plays with it at age 6. Yes, the ""rockin' tunes"" are annoying for parents (my husband HATES the music), but we solved this by making Sit N' Spin ""basement or outside only"" toy. Ours has even survived getting wet on the light panel.EDIT 2009: Five years later, and we still have the Sit N' Spin. Now our 3yo son plays with it. This toy really will hold up, maybe I'll even keep it for the grandchildren I'll probably have one day!"
4,My toddler and preschooler love this toy!,"Santa brought this for my 19-mo daughter last Christmas. She loves it, and so does her 4-yo brother. My toddler loves to stand & spin, and she loves the music. I find the sight of her spinning and bopping amusing enough that the corny, repetitive music doesn't bother me much. The music can't be shut off or turned down, but somehow, the volume is low enough that it doesn't interfere with others in the room watching TV. Both kids have tipped it over a few times or fallen off of it, so have yours use it up on a non-plush carpet with a few feet of clearance around it in all directions. We keep it in a corner and drag it to the middle of the room when desired. It's nice to have an indoor toy that gets them using their body a little bit, even if it's not exactly exercise. A nice change of pace, especially on bad-weather days."
1,Not a good toy like the old one in the seventees-dont buy,"Well, I bought mine for somewhere in the twenty dollar range, so i dont know what they mean by asking almost 90 bucks...anyway, this spinning toy is no good AT ALL. Buy it if you don't believe me, buy one...but dont pay 80 bucks, they go for alot cheaper right in the store. I'm quite disappointed, and months have gone by and I haven't seen my kids manage to make one complete revolution on this junky toy."
2,The music is awful,"I really wish they had regular sit and spins without any musical abilities. The music that plays on this toy is worse than nails on a chalkboard, I immediately took the batteries out. My daughter likes it, and there is no sound (thank goodness)."
1,not as good as the orginal - by far,This new version of the sit and spin was a huge dissapointment. The original was much more sturdy. This new version is made of cheap flimsy plastic...
2,They ruined a great classic toy!,"I didn't think it was possible, but the manufacturer made the Sit N Spin worse when they added lights and sound. It USED to be a great toy! First, the music is the most obnoxious rockabilly-ish stuff I've ever heard. Second, its way too loud for the children's ears, in my opinion. Third, there is no ""off"" button for the lights/music (every parent's nightmare). We bought this for our daughter for Christmas, and I took the batteries out after the first day. What a relief!!"
2,Return ASAP,Sit 'n spin is too small for my son of 26 months. The sound quality is awful and I decided to not even test the durability...... it will be returned tonight.
2,won't play music anymore. after 1 hour,"my daughter played the music about four times and then it broke. it just wont play anymore. and it doesnt spin very well, she has to spin by pushing her hand on the floor to move. she's only 21 months and not too heavy forher age or the toy . it's just horribly built. at least it was cheap. that should have tipped me off."
5,Our son's favorite!,Our 16 month old son got this for Christmas. He was actually spinning on his own the day after he got it! The music is perfect and not too loud.
2,Would Like to Buy,"I was very interested in buying this toy but after reading some to the other reviews I have decided against it. I already have plenty of toys that make noise, I do not need another one. I agree with many other reviews that the old Sin 'n Spin should come back. Why fix it if it isn't broken? Please take into consideration this request because I would love for my child to have one. Thank you."
4,"THIS THING SUCKS, I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT!!!!","This thing SUCKS!! The music is WAAAY too loud AND my son is ONLY 28 pounds and the thing won't spin!!! It seems like if he tries to make it spin it will break! What..a waste of $20!! And yah the fact that there is NO off button is horrible!! It's about to make a disappearing act!! If I knew how to contact the company I would ask for a refund!! What junk!! Don't buy this get your kid something else, or go to a flea market and try to find the good old fashioned kind, the kind that DOES spin and IS quiet!!"
2,Better for older tots,"Santa gave this toy to my daughter for Christmas. She is now 18 months old and she still doesn't sit on it and spin. She tries to stand on it, and ends up losing her balance and tumbling off. Her favorite thing is to press the top to play music or to put a stuffed animal on it and spin the animal around. I hope she will ""rediscover"" this toy when she gets a little older because she seems bored and uninterested with it at her current age. I also find it a little unsettling/dangerous when she tries to stand on the spinning part."
2,A [flimsy] plastic toy,"If your child has any size or weight at all, then don't purchase this toy! My son is rather big for his age of two and he could flip it while trying to turn it....[flimsy] and not worth the money"
3,"OK Toy,BUT....","My granddaughter received this last Christmas at 15 months old.She liked to stand on it and spin(not a good thing)She is now 25 months old and does play with it some.She also likes to spin her stuffed toys on it.She also likes to sit on it and spin while watching Dora.However,there is no off switch for the music and the music is LOUD and TERRIBLE.I have considered taking the batteries out,but for some reason Kiersten does seem to like the music.Toy manufacturers really need to add off switches on toys and TURN DOWN THE VOLUME!!!"
3,"Ohhh...the awful, horrible music!!!!","The music on this toy is the loudest, most annoying, ear piercing noise that I have heard yet on ANY toy my child owns. He enjoys it...and has easily figured out how to spin around. But the noise...my cat even runs in the other direction when she hears this! Needless to say this is one toy that I have NOT replaced the batteries on!My advice...go buy the old version of the Sit & Spin...the one without the music and lights. It's just as much fun for the child, and less disruptive...and less expensive too."
4,when you cant play outside....,this is a great way for kids to get out a little energy and have fun at a time when you can not go outside or you rather them not run around the house etc. my daughter has enjoyed this sit n spin with music for over 2 years now. she gets on it AT LEAST once a week still! she loves the music and spinning on it. (she is almost 5 years old now) great toy!! and its holding up great :)
4,Great fun!,My daughter got this for her 2nd birthday and still plays with it now (she's 3.) My older kids are always stepping on it and it has held up so far. She loves spinning to the music! Good classic toy.
5,Great for your little ones!!,We got this for Christmas and my 1 1/2 year old and 6 year old have enjoy it a lot. The music is not obnoxiously loud either. It was very easy to set up and it will be great for a long time to come. It developes coordination and balance. They even fight over it!!! It is perfect for everyone in the age group.
1,My 2 don't like this one.,"Neither of my toddlers like this toy other than to stand on top of it and jump off. I must admit it has held up well under this abuse. Although it has several catchy tunes and blinking lights, they care nothing about spinning around on it."
3,1 Day Toy,"I bought this for my grandson age 2, it lasted one day before he had the top steering wheel off, we repaired it , it lasted one more day, steering wheel comes off too easy for an active toddler, also the round base where child sits is awful small, making it hard for child to wrap themselves around it and turn small steering wheel at same time."
1,Too loud and doesn't spin fast enough,"This Sit n Spin definitely does not go as fast as the one we had as kids. Perhaps child safety issues have made the company slow down the rotation, but it's just not as fun. And the music, with neither volume control nor an on/off switch, is deafening and irritating, even to my four year-old son. Not worth it. Find an old one at a thrift store (without music) and save your money!"
4,Great toy - just don't put the batteries in.,"I got this for my daughter when she was 16 months. It took her a month or two to really figure it out. She originally preferred to stand on it, which is obviously dangerous. But now (she's 22 months) she sits right down and loves to spin. When I put it together I noticed the battery compartment cannot be accessed easily and after hearing the music for about 5 seconds I decided we never needed to hear it again. And it doesn't need it at all. Definitely one of her favorite toys and she is never the wiser about lights and sounds."
1,This toy was a bad purchase!!!,"I purchased this toy for Christmas for my 18 month old son, and while putting it together was easy, the toy just didn't work. The toy would not spin! My son could not turn himself and I had difficulty doing it for him. I wanted to take it back, but I'd thrown my receipt away. Save your money on this toy it just isn't worth it."
3,Music is Aweful,"-as a few others have said this toy is just not as sturdy as the one we had as kids-the music is aweful- screechy and, well, our has been forever silenced"
2,"Fun, but breaks","My kids loved this, but they stood on it and older children used it and my 2 year old pulled the steering wheel out and it never went back. It became wobbly and always fell out. I had to throw it away. They just don't make things like the used to."
1,dangerous,"This toy is very dangerous, not to mention annoying. It doesn't have a power switch and if you even breath on it it will go into a rock n roll medley that will wake up your entire household. My son almost sprained his ankle on it."
2,Not top quality,"I agree with many of the other reviewers. First the quality of this toy is sub-par. The plastic structure is very flimsy. The middle part that you twist to spin around bends a great deal and is not sturdy enough to get a good twist. This leads to it being very hard to spin. Overall, I was very dissappointed since my son has never really used it and I remember loving this toy as a youngter."
5,Good toy for letting off steam indoors,"Like the Sit'n Spins from my childhood, this is great outlet for kids' energy in the house. It has also served as a pretend conveyor belt. The music is activated not by spinning but by tapping the top of the center column (I wish the music was related to the spinning). There is no off switch or volumn control for the music but that hasn't been a problem for us. We have to change the batteries only infrequently. I only give it 4 stars for duability based on its predecessor, which broke only after heavy use when the base of the center column cracked. It's a great toy for energetic 2 1/2 to 4 year olds."
3,"Mommy, I'm dizzy!",Can't say that this was one of my 2 1/2 year olds favorite Christmas gifts. She's played with it on and off since then. Maybe she's not old enough to get it going fast or she's just not too interested in spinning around until she's dizzy. She likes to play the music and has even tried standing on it. It hasn't fallen apart yet with her inventing different ways of playing with it other than its real use so I'd say its durable. I'll keep this one until she's older and maybe she'll find it more interesting.
5,It's the same toy you loved when you were a kid!,"If you child likes to spin in circles, s/he'll love this toy! Another ""bonus"" is that it has a button on the top that plays various instrumental short tunes. Fortunately, it's not very loud, which tends to be my main complaint about children's musical toys. And, I'm not sure what the 'real' song is, and depending on your age, you might not know what I'm talking about, but one of the songs it plays is ""Great Green Globs of Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts.."" (Obviously just the tune, not the words). The memory gave me a smile."
2,Too Loud,"The speakers are right near the ears, there is no volume control and the music is loud enough to deamage hearing. Save you money and your child's hearing and by the non-musical version."
2,Nope A Dope,Would not waste my time on this. I have decided to go for the EZ Red Hydrometer from now on (I have purchased quite a few EZ Reds since then). The glass broke because a small pebble accidentally fell on it. Way too fragile for my liking. And it does not 'suck up' like the EZ Red. It still works though. Please do not get me wrong.
5,WOW! Remastering a classic,"I used to listen to this album under the grand shadow of Can's masterpiece, Tago Mago. Both albums -- ur, CD's -- have now been remastered. I'd purchased a Tago Mago CD a couple years ago, but decided to buy Ege Bamyasi to see how good the remastering is.Wow.I had forgotten how powerful the songs and the performances are, but I was actually startled at how the drums, guitar, and bass jumped out of my speakers. I immediately got the remastered Tago Mago as well. Both albums feature Can at the height of their powers, both albums among the best that emerged from the Kraut Rock movement.If you're not a Can fan yet, let the music, which is different than what you're used to, sink into your soul: listen to it a lot before evaluating it. If you ARE a Can fan already, I recommend these remasters highly."
5,more greatness,"Tago Mago, 1971, is widely and justly throught of as Can's masterwork: a sprawling double album of funk and expermentation.Yet this disc is in some ways more intense: the songs are shorter, the funk has more bite, the nuances are darker, and the avant gaurde section of the album, ""soup,"" --filled with Damo's demonic scatting and some amazing electronic doom--is far more dence and edgey than any work Can had previously done.This is an album that truely tears apart your system and then puts it back together.So never make the mistake of thinking if you own Tago you have all the Can you need. No, not by a long shot."
4,Timeless and modern forever,"May favorite Can. Their music is linear which makes them sound modern. The styles here range from punkish funk rock tunes with tribal rhythms to precise yet random sounding experimental vocal and guitar pieces. I like how there always seems to be equal parts art, rock and soul in Can's music. All that and Damo's unusual vocal style adds up to a classic. The best records are this one, Tago Mago, Furture Days and Soon Over Babaluma (but this last one sees the band in a slightly different sound because they use more types of intruments). The older stuff just seems too under-realized and the newer stuff was sort of bland. But you have four excellent records to enjoy and get enlighted with."
4,Perverted humour at it's best...,"I had the chance to watch the complete anime series on Youtube and I have to say I had mixed emotions about it. At first I thought this show was going to be one of those lame crappy love stories but I really thought wrong, also I thought of how Kintaro was an idiot or how much of a goofball he is. Either way, this whole anime series kept me on the edge of my seat and also forced me to yell at the computer screen and laugh out loud. In this series, the have the major laughs,the usual perverted humour,and hot chicks. Now if you are not into stuff that is perverted...this anime is not for you because in this series they have nip-slips,panty shots,and more. To me, this series is worth the money and I am going to buy it right away."
5,One for the money!,Kintaro Oe is a 25 year old freeter as he calls himself. this is an anime about men and the way their minds work towards women they like or have sexual feelings about! I am female and I loved it I thought it was hilarious!!! WATCH THIS SHOW!!!!
1,grief recovery workbook: helping you weather the storms of death divorce and overwhelming disappointments,"much less helpful than desired. very christian outlook but not advertised as so. a real turn off for anyone who isn't a born again christian. i would never give this to any client who wasn't a committed christian. advice okay but not terribly helpful. not worth sending away for, in my opinion (and i'm a born again christian)."
4,Works Good,"I got these a a month ago I believe and the cables have been working well. I don't have any complaints, though I am using a small monitor so I can't fully attest to their ability."
5,Good Quality Cable,"This Xbox VGA cable is excellent. There are other knock-off products that may look like this one, but will perform poorly. I had bought one of those previously for $5.00 also on Amazon, and it looked terrible. It functioned, but it duplicated the entire screen three times shifted to the right. This cable on the other hand shows high definition resolution on par with the HD composite cables. Excellent and crisp picture, couldn't ask for more. 5 Stars."
2,??? I dont get it ???,"I bought this cable because i only have one component input and the 360 has no HDMI out. I wanted to use the component input for my Wii, but after seeing the crappy picture quality with this I'll live with composite for the Wii. The cable is probably only good for DVD upconversion. Component has a far superior picture that's not as washed out. The VGA cable made my 360 dashboard look bad too. Even after i changed the display settings to my TV's resolution it looked completely washed out and colorless. So unless you have a 1080p TV and want DVD upconversion through an analog cable don't buy this. You'd be happier with component cables."
1,Beware 1080i HDTV owners!,I ran out of room for all of my component cables and figured using the VGA connection for the 360 was an easy sollution. The xbox website states that the VGA cable supports all HDTV resolutions. I found out the hard way that is WRONG! I have an older HDTV that only supports 480i/p and 1080i. Once having this hooked up to my VGA connection and the system I was able to view the VGA settings. There is NO resolution choice for 1080i widescreen HD. Since my TV doesn't support 720p or 1080p I was stuck with standard definition through this HD cable. Be warned if you have an older TV that supports a VGA connection but only 1080i! Back to the component cable I go and trying to find a good sysytem selector.
5,VGA cable is a great buy,"This cable was just what I needed for my college dorm. I have both an xbox 360 and a computer and being able to use my computer monitor for my xbox saved me a lot of money. The cable works great, it came with the plugins for me to plug it into my computer speakers and now I have a great picture with great sound thanks to the vga cable!"
5,just great,"WORKS FINE, i use it for my projector,full 1080p, i would recomend this cable to anyone. its been a year now."
5,Cheap knock up wires: 0 MS wires:1,No ghosting whatsoever and works as describes. I origginally bought a $10 3rd party wire but it had way too many problems and ended up back here. Should have bought this one first.
5,Great if you want to run your Xbox off your computer monitor/speakers,"This thing works very nicely. It allows you to play your Xbox off your computer monitor. It also allows you to run sound through your PC speakers. To do this, you must attach the provided adapter to the cables, and then plug it into the back of your PC. You will then be able to run sound from your Xbox and PC. The only time this may create a problem is if you're running both machines at once, as you will hear sound from both the PC and Xbox piping through the speakers.Oh, and as others have commented - the picture quality off the monitor with this adapter is excellent."
4,"Works good, but one caveat","This cable works as advertised but one thing to be aware of is that although the cable is quite long, the split between the video portion and the audio portion is pretty short. Microsoft assumes your sound output is going to be close to your video output. If that's not your set up, then you may need an extension cable. I needed a stereo extension cable to reach my speaker system's input jack - located on the subwoofer which is on the floor."
4,Stopped working after less than 2 years,"The VGA HD AV cable does exactly what it needs to do. If you have a monitor you can use the cable for an alternative HD output. It was excellent while it lasted, but after 1 year and 9 months of solid playing it died on me. I took care of it as well, but I guess it just has a limited lifespan."
4,Bought Used,"I bought this cable used (missing the packaging) so that I could have the full HD gaming experience on a budget. I've only had it for a few hours now but I am greatly satisfied--it's everything I wished for and more. The colors were not washed out or anything of the sort for me, as other reviewers have complained, and the sound was much better when hooked up to speakers instead of my cheap 19"" television.Word to the wise however, make sure that if you buy used you purchase one that comes with the adapter--otherwise you'll be limited in your sound options."
3,works great,I got it I hooked it up and I was impressed with the pic of my xbox 360. This is a good buy and invesment.
2,Washed out on 1080p HDTV,"I got this for use with the Xbox 360 HD DVD add on for my Samsung LNS4095D to get full 1080p, but to my disappointment, this cable vastly washed out the color on my set compared to the component cable which is bright and sharp. However it does upscale dvds fairly nicely, with exceptoin of being slightly washed out blacks compared to component as well. Im not much of an audio/videophile type but even I can see the difference clearly.I guess I should have done more research as I have found out my set does not send the proper color output from the vga connection, which is designated PC Vga. Either M$ provides an update for my set or I will try to return this expensive cable and stick to the component."
2,I want to love this thing,"I would love to give this item a higher review. It is perfect in every way except the colors look really weak and washed out.When plugged in, the 360 gives you the option of picking what screen resolution to use. I picked 1920x1080. That is really nice because it adjusts to the correct aspect ratio and resolution. There is an option with the Spring 360 update to adjust the black level in VGA which makes a world of difference reducing the brightness, but this setting does nothing to restore the vibrancy that you get by running the 360 through a component cable.I would give this cable 5 stars if it didn't wash out the colors like it does which unfortunately makes it useless."
4,Great for xbox Son was happy.,I purchased this tool for my son's xbox to be used with a extra monitor I had. Worked perfectly. I'm very happy about the cost was seriously lower than in stores. This cable put me in the kool mom's category.
5,"For the price, great!","When I got the cord, it came with more than I expected. It came with the standard cable, plus an RCA audio to headphone jack adaptor, and a VGA extention adapter, which was great!The only complaint is that there was some sticky residue along the cable of something. But for the price, I cant complain. Just used some remover to get it off of parts of the cord, and it was as good as new. And the picture looks great. Much better than the RCA a/v input's quality."
5,Best alternative to HDMI and great for computer monitor play.,"The vga HD cables are the best alternative to HDMI. Full 1080p support. Full 16:10 aspect ratio support. Its great for anyone who wants the full HD experience on computer monitors. In my opinion the games actually look better when i play them on my 22"" monitor than it does on my 40"" TV. The older reviews talk alot about about a ""washed-out"" or stretched look, however as long as you have the latest free firmware (dashboard/NXE) update on your xbox 360, the picture looks clear, and very sharp. There is no washed out look, and if you play on a computer monitor, the image will display small black bars on the top and bottom of the screen to prevent stretching. They are cables are called vga cables but they display resolutions up to 1080p."
2,"Does what it says, but I got a weird fuzz.","Not sure if the problem is my TV, my Xbox 360 or both. But I bought this cable because I wanted to upres my DVDs, and indeed it does work for that purpose. However, the quality of the picture, although slightly sharper than the composite cable, got weird and fuzzy. Might have something to do with refresh rate, I don't know.I returned the cable and am happy with my composite. I now use a HDMI DVD player to upres. They cost $50 on Amazon."
3,1080p woohoo!,"1080p on a Westinghouse LVM-37w3 works fine with my 360 and its attached HD-DVD player. Subjectively speaking, I think the component inputs had better color reproduction, though. All in all, a worthwhile purchase to remove the borders and get full access to my content without zooming or stretching."
4,Pricy but Necessary,"I had just recently purchased the HD DVD addon as I was planning on using the 360 as my main DVD player. However, I discovered that the 360 will not upconvert DVDs unless you are using the VGA cable, so here I am.Luckily, I have a PLV-Z4 720p projector with a VGA input. When I first hooked up the 360 to the projector via VGA I did notice the ""washed out"" look everyone was complaining about, but this was easily corrected using some basic brightness/contrast adjustments found on the AVIA Home Theater DVD.Now I've got the best picture I've seen so far at 1280 x 720 and DVDs look great. The 360 really does a good job of smoothing out jaggies and bringing out the best in the limited DVD format. And HD DVDs look incredible.Bottom line, even though $40 bucks is a tad expensive, if you want to upconvert standard DVDs, get this."
5,great cable,"this is the same cable you can get at other stores for 40$ but if you get it used it can be more than half that. i got mine used and i couldn't tell the difference if it was new or not and it is the Microsoft cable, not a third party cable so you know it will be good. Ive never had a problem with it and i know i never will. its a great cable and i would recommend to anyone looking to play their xbox 360 on a computer monitor or even a TV with a VGA input."
4,women's shoes,"These shoes became my girlfriends favorite, they fit her perfect, but the shoes took a while to get here."
4,Old fashioned fun,"Based on the play and the comic strip by the same name, this movie takes us on a wonderful trip to Dogpatch, USA. Mammy Yokum's Kikapoo Joy Juice helps men grow big and strong, with only one small drawback. The ones who use it, don't want anything to do with girls! Lot's of fun for those who love old musicals!!"
4,Forgotten Comic Character Fun,"Peter Palmer and Leslie Parrish are excellent in this fun, politically skewering musical comedy. The songs are upbeat fun, especially ""Put Em Back"" sung by the wives of the new muscle men who express no interest in their mates."
3,amusingly political,"There are a couple of songs that are catchy sung by Stubby Kaye. The story is exagerated sexist, but funny."
4,Lil Abner,Fun movie for the whole Family. Key word FAMILY. Everyone from 8 to 80 will enjoy this movie.
5,Dogpatch,"As good as it was when it first came out. Refreshing departure from the decadent movies and TV of today.Happy musical from the fifties. Good, carefree, family entertainment."
4,A fun inprobability,"This is a fun musical based on the improbability that the government will bomb a community based on the fact there was no usefulness about them. The cast of characters then try to prove there is something useful. At first it is thought that Mammie's tonic will provide the proof. That fails, but they are saved at the last moment. The show includes the Sadie Hawkins race where women try to catch a husband and an evil businessman and his shady female associate try to control the race and the availability of Mammie's tonic. The highlight of the entire show, however, is Stubby Kaye who plays the part of Marrying Sam. His portrayal and his singing are superb. I recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys fun improbabilities and especially those who remember the Lil Abner cartoon strip that was printed for so many years in the nation's newspapers."
2,Where's the Music?,"This 'musical' contains a dearth of great songs - ""Jubilation T. Cornpone"" being as good as they get. And I do mean 'dearth'."
4,Great musical,Couldn't have asked for faster shipment; it arrived in a couple of days and it's just as funny as I remembered. The DVD itself had no scratches or wear at all. One thing puzzles me though; when you play the DVD there is an obvious pause in the middle. It reminds me of how the old video discs used to pause when they were switching sides. Makes me wonder if it's actually a copy of a video disc rather than an original DVD.
1,Li'l Abner,I rate the DVD you sent me as poor. Li'l Abner plays a quarter of the way and then freezes up. I am trying it on a third DVD player and it freezes up in the same place as the first two players. How can I get my money back or a new copy of Li'l Abner?
4,Rare movie,In loving great movie musicals this movie is for you. If you like the comic strip Lil AbnerThen having this rare VHS movie is a great find
4,Very enjoyable film,"Highly entertaining production, featuring the various Al Capp characters, portrayed very effectively. I especially appreciated Stella Stevens as Appasionata von Climax, Stubby Kaye as Marrying Sam, Julie Newmar as Stupifying Jones and Jamie Farrell (Klinger from Mash) as Evil Eye Fleegel."
4,brought back good childhood memories,a good clean wholesome family movie that brought back a lot of childhood memories. lots of fun to watch! something you will probably never see on tv again
4,I've been looking for this for 20 years!,"I loved this musical as a kid and still hum the music from the numbers which I remember better than some of the biggest spectacles on Broadway and film today. As with the above review, our local high school also put on this musical quite successfully. Having never seen it on video, and seen it only twice (once on film, one high school production) as a child, I can still remember the words to the songs--try that today even with some of the videos your kids watch over and over--NOT LIKELY! It's not Rogers and Hammerstein, but the satire was hysterical in the fifties--and it still seems funnier than half of what's on TV today!"
3,OLD FASHIONED MUSICAL GRAD C+,"Quality of DVD excellent.As an old-fashioned musical there is something missing from the entire production to make it a true classic that would warrant watching it many times like SINGING IN THE RAIN or SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS. Political theme still surpirisingly timely. Boy meets girl etc. concept cute. Leads talented. I think what's missing is inspired innovative choeorgraphy - lots of box and circle formations and bouncing up and down which is actually boring to watch. If you've seen just about every musical in the A and B leagues and you have time on your hands or if you're related to one of the cast members, Li'l Abner is just OK as an ole relic."
4,L'il Abner the 1959 screen verision of the stage play,Seeing this movie again brought a smile to my face and many happy memories to mind. It also brought laughter to two new generation. My children and grandchildren. It is a movie that can be watched in mixed company without fear of being embarrassed. Two big thumbs up for a very entertaining movie.
4,FUN IS THE GO HERE!,"The songs are toe-tappers with fun lyrics. The satire is subtle and low key. The cartoonish backgrounds adds to the fun and, I think, relates to the original very well."
5,moving testimonial,You don't have to be a woman or a cancer victim/survivor to be affected by this moving documentary. The dedication and courage of so many women from all over the world is truly inspiring.
5,Awe-inspiring!,"A must buy! I have already watched this movie twice and it gives me goose bumps. It teaches so many important lessons, but the one that stands out the most is determination. An awesome group of ladies accomplished a very impressive feat despite setbacks in their lives. I loved it, so will you!"
5,VERY HAPPY WITH VENDOR,"I recieved this script in a timely manner. Everything to do with the sale was satisfactory. The script itself, I was pretty pleased but was slightly irritated at some unresolved issues in the storyline."
4,A bit of a confusing read....,In reading this book I expected more traditional tales with a moral at the end but these seem to me to wander about and leave one wondering what they just read. I am sure they are rich in Japanese lore but for a westerner they can be daunting. Still a good read overall and it gave me a view into this ancient culture.
4,You Did Good!,"This item took a little longer then expected but I got it, it was in great shape, and I am very happy with this book. It was definitely the right price and I couldn't be happier with the book. There was very limited highlighting and it looked good compared to the type of book it is. My last book like this fell apart in about one weeks use. Thanks alot!"
3,Okay.,"The book was sent in a timely fashion and I was very pleased that is was correct. The only thing that I was disappointed was that the book was written in and had many bent pages. I don't mind, being that it is a used book after all, but when I purchase a book with a ""very good"" rating, I expect a book in much better shape."
1,unsatisfied,so far i don't have any good experience since this book was never delivered. i have been charge for it and i have email to seller and amazon for explanation however i have not receive any respond yet since last week or so 10-3-08. This book should be delivered no later than 9/30/08 and hasn't arrived yet. no money back and no book
2,Too many superficial generalizations,"This book was one of the required readings for a class I took years ago on Humans, Computer and Cognition. Unfortunately, I did not think highly of Donald Norman's opinions because I felt many of them were simply over generalizations. Perhaps this is because I have a background in psychology that includes learning and motivation. I found myself disagreeing with many of Norman's statements and routinely asking, ""What evidence is he basing that on?"""
3,"Good, but Simplistic","I have to preface this review by saying that I'm probably a tough audience for this sort of book -- I have a PhD in cognitive psych, and I work as a research scientist with a specialist in interface designs. With that caveat, I have to say that the book was very readable and enjoyable, but I was constantly wondering ""Where's the Beef?""Much of the research he reviewed was rather old, even at the time of publication, and most of the analysis of them elaborated too much, without really being that trenchant. I found myself skipping ahead about halfway through the book when I knew the point of a chapter after a page or two, and didn't find any surprises along the way.A good ""gee-whiz"" book for those new to cognitive psych or human factors, but a bit of a let-down for the specialist."
1,Not for everyday use. Will not hold up.,Stanley 47-483 100 FatMax Xtreme Chalk Box 2 Piece Set with 4 oz Bottle of Stanley Red ChalkI do layout all day every day and have been through many chalk boxes. This box looks cool and someone came up with some good ideas for features but durability was not one of them. I have two of these boxes. The first I used for six hours before the line broke. I had to order replacement line because it is not stocked at any local store. I purchased another box while waiting for replacement line. The second box jammed up before delivery of the replacement line. After replacing line in both boxes they lasted a total of 5 days before they both were jammed up and inoperable. This product would be OK for homeowner use but not for a pro.
5,Mastered by Steve Hoffman,"Another masterpice from Steve Hoffman. This SACD is really fine. It sounds very rich, smooth and lifelike. Buy it - you won't be disappointed!"
5,Bear is great!,Bear in the Big Blue House is a great asset to any young child's learning. It has been a favorite in our household for years.
2,traveltalk spanish audio,"Specifically relating to the audio book- there are a lot of helpful words included but there is no music, words are only repeated twice and you are not tested or required to construct a sentence. This disappointed me as its not as interactive as I wanted."
4,Almost perfect,"The best on this release is the sound , it is much better then on dvd.Why no 5 stars ?Because of the aspect-ratio , this is not made for 16/9 tv's.Every musiclover must have this in his collection..."
1,Great content.....pitiful resolution !!!!!,"I had very high hopes for the Hendrix footage but was sadly disappointed in the quality of the video. It should not be called ""bluray"". It gives the buyer the idea like the resolution is 1080P. The video is grainy and pathetic. The content is great but the quality of the disc is pathetic. Don't buy this for a high quality video concert...you will be sadly disappointed. Buy it for content only."
3,DESCENT IS DECENT,"This mildly entertaining ripoff of THE CORE was made for the Sci-Fi Channel, and although not a great film, it manages to entertain and involve the audience in its rather preposterous storyline. Much of it is derivative and predictable, but supporting performances from Michael Dorn, Mimi Kuzyk and Adam Frost make up for the lackluster leading performances of Luke Perry, Rick Roberts and Brandi Marie Ward. The CGI effects are acceptable, and overall, it's not bad for a disaster ripoff."
4,"Well....I liked it, and didn't like the CORE","I thought Michael Dorn was a ""hoot"". I think he was cast the way he was because you were not suppose to like him. And I think he did a great job of it. I partically enjoyed Rick Roberts performance. Just like some golfer, some folks take their sci-fi movies far too serious. All in all the plot and acting was very decent. I actually recorded in on cable and have watched it enough to know I want it in my collection. And I learned something very valuable from these reviews. If a movie sounds like something I would enjoy... having terrible reviews is not always a reason not to purchase it."
4,Explosive romantic suspense!!!,"Tired of desk duty, FBI agent Adam Duval takes an assignment deep undercover to infiltrate a family of militia by getting close to the youngest son. He doesn't count on being left to linger in prison, and soon talks quarry Lyle McEdwin into joining him in a prison break. Ever the hot head, Lyle gets into a shoot out with an off duty cop, and is injured. Breaking into an intercity clinic, Adam forces Dr. Renata Curtis to tend to Lyle's wounds, then soon kidnaps her to keep Lyle alive while they travel to the lair of the McEdwin family, who appear to have something coming up on the horizon. Renata finds herself full of self-doubts as she tries to resist her attraction to convict Adam, not realizing his true identity.Yet another home run for Bach - it has it all, romance, intrigue, suspense, and plenty of tension. And with a surprise ending to boot! Definitely recommend checking this one out - you won't be sorry!"
1,How Use Laws of Mind by Joseph Murphy,The book arrived highlighted in yellow and orange.The seller did not say the book was highlighted or marked up.I complained to him.He told me to return the book to him at my expense.I complained to Amazon.Amazon refunded my money.This is why I have dealt with Amazon since they began selling books.
4,Excellent Introduction to Some Classic Ideas!,"I read a couple of Dr. Murphy's books prior to this one, so many of the core ideas were quite familiar, but this book goes into greater detail than others in terms of improving your personal health and the quality of your relationships. Other books by this author focus more on the attainment of material wealth. Dr. Murphy had some innovative ideas on the symbolism contained in the Bible and quotes many scriptures. However, he is not exclusive of other creeds and has a more Universalist perspective than is common in philosophical works these days. I highly recommend this book, as well as ""Telephysics,"" and ""The Power of the Subconscious Mind,"" by the same author."
4,An inspiring book,"This is another inspiring book by Joseph Murphy, who comes second only to Neville among authors teaching the powers of the mind.He explains how to heal both oneself and others, and solve all types of problems, by the use of affirmative prayer, not begging for help, but declaring faith and love. He also recommends the reading aloud of the 23rd, 27th, or/and 91st Psalm several times during the day so as to ""saturate the mind with ... great truths"" and gradually transform the mind.He recounts many cases of people who have been helped by the method he advises, and quotes widely from the Bible, explaining the meaning of the various metaphorical statements.There is only one (good) Power, as he explains in a useful chapter about the ""meaning of Satan"".A book to be recommended for those in need of inspiration or help in working out their problems."
5,"Good product, easy to use",This works like a charm. makes a clean fit and makes installing speakers a breeze. Tabs are a perfect way to secure the bracket to the wall and to remove one if you decide to get rid of or change the speakers.
3,Only because of Monica. Picture quality very poor...,"If you are watching this, I guess it is highly likely that you are interesed in Monica Bellucci, like me. She is as stunning as ever in this movie, BUT not as sexy as in Malena, or as 'exposed' as in Irreversible.Otherwise, I would say this is only a so-so movie. The story is interesting, but I think it just can be better (either more funny or more violent).The worst part of this DVD is its quality - the color quality is like fade painting...very disappointing."
1,Don't waste your time and money please.,"I had no expectations for this film. I just wanted a no brainer action flick with some good looking women in it. (WARNING - spoilers ahead) The story which was the strongest part of the film dissapointed me in the end when you find out the main heroine used to be a man who was deeply in love with main villain (also a man). Once this was revealed I began to lose interest in the female lead actress. The action was slow, boring and when the end of the movie finally came I breathed a sigh of relief and gave the dvd away and I have certainly not missed it.I have to say this though, if you want to see something different and are not just in it for the girls and violence this might be and intersting movie for you. Like I stated the story is the strong point its the acting, pace and action which just doesn't hold up."
5,My favorite earrings!,"(Review by Jessica) I received these several years ago from my husband. Best Christmas gift ever! They are my favorite earrings and I have lent them to my sister for her wedding (something borrowed...). Lovely and perfect, they have the advantage of being a typical pearl stud earring with the 'zest' of the white golden swirl."
4,"JEWEL LIVE AT HUMPHEY'S BY THE BAY : Excelente concierto de la ""joya"" para aquellos que gusten de este estilo musical.","Para todos aquellos amantes de la musica country, aqui tienen un buen plato con la joya JEWEL actuando acompañada primero por si misma con su guitarra, y luego por un grupo muy acoplado, les recomiendo este Dvd."
5,"Good value, good cushioning","I was looking for a black walking shoe to wear for mall-walking on the hard marble surface. With high arches, cushioning is a prime reason for buying a good shoe. This shoe meets the requirements, sturdy upper part(no mesh), cushioning throughout. Let's see how they hold up."
5,Nourish Your Plants with A Shower,"I have owned many different shower head wands. This one is by far the best I have owned. It has a water shut off valve on the wand to allow you to turn the water on to water your plants then shut it off without being wasteful with the water. You will be very pleased with the ""LR Nelson 2632 32"" Wand, Aluminum Shower Head."""
4,Nice and scary,"I picked up this book on a whim.The basic premise is set in a ""State Hospital"" with a spooky basement (left over from the days when people with drinking problems were put in asylums).The story was told in a straightforward manner and the main character was interesting in a generic kind of way. While I could have used more interaction between Trey and Jane, prior to them heading to the basement, the characters worked for me.This book is fair until you hit about 2/3 of it when the hospital needs to be evacuated and most of the characters find themselves in the dreary, spooky basement. The author describes the action in a quick, precise manner and makes sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.You can actually picture yourself going through the torture chambers, etc. As a matter of fact, in my opinion, the descriptions of the basement are more interesting than the ""bad guys"" in this book.Put it all together and you get a solid, scary story."
4,"Love Clegg, love this series.","Love the criminally insane series. I am a new fan of Douglas Clegg and I have read about 6 of his books over the last few months. I found it to be well writtin, but MANY editing mistakes...mispelled words, etc. I think book 1 was great, 2 even better, and 3 the best. Can't wait for my next clegg book to start tonight."
4,A good follow up..to a good series.,"This really was a very entertaining series. Very readable. Again well written, easy to follow and very entertaining. This in my opinion is probably the best of the series."
3,Basic Thriller,"There's nothing bad about this book, but nothing too great, either. It's the standard psycho-revenge-story where every plot twist is seen a mile away. It does move at a fast pace, which I enjoyed, but I can't quite recommend it. During the last third of the book, many scenes are cut back and forth where suspenseful details are left out as the story moves ahead and the reader fills in the blanks. However, those blanks could have added the flavor and atmosphere that this book desperately needed. Andrew Harper/Douglas Clegg writes this book as if it were a 90 minute movie -- skipping the details -- instead of taking the time to examine the terror of each situation and delve into the characters the way a good novel does."
3,Can be a bit tedious,Good insight into the impact Northern Dancer had on racing in... a lot of detail on lineage ... Enjoyed Stud a pretty good offering for pedigree enthusiasts
4,Interesting -,"Armand Assante stars in ""Federal Protection"" a mobster ""hide and seek"" tale. He plays a very lucky mobster that is put into a suburbia neighborhood to hide from his murderous mob colleagues. Originally he worked in a auto chop shop, but had to leave when the mob got tough and he had to fight for his life. Suburbia changes him as he meets the neighbors and finds true love. ""Federal Protection"" is action packed and keeps your attention as the neighbors become a big part of the mobster's life."
1,A waste of money,This costume was cheap so thats the positive thing about it. The negatives are that it is cheap. The mask is unusable because the way they package it causes it to be wrinkled and not spherical. The mask is also hot and hard to hear in.
3,Jack Skellinton Costume,"I was so excited to see that there was a Jack Skellington costume this past Halloween. I was a little disappointed in the mask though. It came flattened and no matter what I did it wouldn't round out. I tried stretching it over a ball, heating it, stuffing it, etc. but in the end Jack had a football-head. Maybe next year I will figure out the trick. Other than that, I thought it was a fun costume that requires little extra effort on your part. And I was really surprised at how many young kids knew who Jack was."
3,NICE BUT THE MASK WAS A BIT DIFFICULT,THE JACKET WAS VERY NICE AND LOOKED GREAT BUT THE MASK WAS SO SMASHED N THE PACKAGING THAT HIS HEAD WAS NOT ROUND AND LUMPY ALL OVER. SO I HAD TO SHOVE A SMALL KIDS BOUNCY BALL IN IT AND STUFF THE REMAINING SPACE WITH WASH CLOTHES. I LEFT IT IN THE SUN A CPL DAYS AND IT HELPED. THEN I TOOK THE WASH CLOTHS OUT ENOUGH TO FIT MY HAND AND BLEW AT IT WITH MY BLOW DRYER AND STRETCHED OUT MOST OF THE LUMPS AND FIXED THE EYE PART. IT STILL WASNT AS PERFECT AS I WOULD HVE LIKED SO ITS UP TO U IF U WANNA DO ALL THAT WORK. I WISH THEY WOULD SEND THE MASK PACKAGED IN THE SHAPE ITS SUPPOSED TO B IN.
1,Please Wilderness..... Swallow them Up,"A bunch of incompetent Yahoos go out digging in the woods. Its really as simple as that. Aload of twerps get some money together, decide to go to alaska and try to mine Gold..... Very Unsuccessfully. If there was a competition between The sea shepherd crew of WHALE WARS and the Hoffman crew on GOLD RUSH over which bunch of morons were the most incompetent ,the Hoffmans would win by miles. It was cringe worthy to watch, especially the patriarch of the group , the father.... There's a Certified Fool if ever there was one.We all know there's bears in alaska don't we, so if we were setting up camp we'd take a gun or two for protection.... But 47???? What are they thinking??? Complete and utter Yahoos..... And why the hell did they bring their kids up there.... Watch it... Even just one episode, it will make you happy to know that even on your worst day you will be more intelligent than any of these guys on their best day."
1,This show stinks,These guys are stupid. This show is so scripted..more so then other simular shows. I didn't know the north west had hillbillys but apparently they do. I am glad it was only $5.35 because I was able to check it out and now I can sell it on ebay for 3/4 of what I paid hopefully. I am trashing it on here but when I sell it on Ebay I am going to be playing it up so maybe someone will buy it.
1,Much better if you mute the sound,"If you enjoy an endless stream of platitudes, cliches, and banal bromides that pass for hillbilly wisdom, you will really enjoy this show."
5,Awesome show!,"This is an awesome program - and I didn't get to see the whole first season so it give my husband and I a chance to ""catch up""."
3,Beware: This is NOT traditional 5 spice power.,"I am a big fan of Marshall Creek spices and love the fact that you can buy larger quantities of the ones you use regularly. However, be forewarned about this Oriental Five Spice Powder. Under normal circumstances, Five Spice Powder contains anise or fennel, cinnamon, cloves, pepper and ginger. If you will read the ingredients closely, which I should have done, it contains cumin,coriander and orange peel along with ginger and cinnamon. This produces a sort of Middle Eastern or Mexican flavor and does not give you a typical or even close Five Spice flavor. The spice is fresh and I still trust Marshall Creek for spice purchases, but will not order the Oriental Five Spice from them again. Check out the others for a truer flavor. You will be glad you did."
3,list ingredients,"The oriental five spice that I loved was running out and I couldn't find it any where , so I figured I'd buy from amazon along with some halloween treats. I figuered that most oriental five spice mixes would be similar.the mix that I have includes cinnamon, nutmeg, anise, ginger, and cloves. The oreiental five spice that i got from Marshalls Creek Spices included ginger, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, and orange peel. Clearly not the same taste. When selling mixed spices the seller (marshall creek spices) should list ingredients so that prospective buyers like me can make intelligent choices."
2,Ever heard of Dead Can Dance?,"I'm a huge fan of Arcana and I own all of their recordings. I was very excited that they'd come out with a new CD. This CD is nothing like any of their previous music. Gone are the kettle drums, church bells, and Gregorian chant-like vocals. This new CD sounds extremely similar to Dead Can Dance. Although I am a Dead Can Dance fan and own all of their recordings as well, I've grown rather bored with their sound and was disappointed to see Arcana emulating a style that's been around for over two decades and is on it's way out, in my humble opinion.Still, if you've never heard Dead Can Dance before and aren't burned out on the whole middle-eastern, belly dance, street bazaar, ambient thing, then this may be just the CD for you. In typical Arcana style, it is well produced and is filled with great musical imagery."
1,Poor Performer,"I was spoiled by my last mixer, which lasted for 25 years, had 7 speeds and beaters that stayed in the housing. This mixer does not have enough variable speeds and is too powerful even on low speeds. So powerful that the batter flies all over the kitchen, and the beaters come out of the housing. I usually like Cuisinart products but will never buy another hand mixer made by them. I use my Kitchen Aid stand mixer instead."
2,Good while it works,"Ours worked well for two years; recently, however, one of the beaters has stopped turning reliably--the (plastic?) gears inside seem to have stripped. Since warranty service is 1/3 the whole cost of a new unit, we will probably try our luck with another brand."
5,Excellent Hand-held choice,Light and easy to handle. Does well with the power it has - double batch cookies w/o tiring. Had reservations about the beater design but they're great - do the job and really easy to clean!
3,No slow setting- too powerful,"I bought this hand mixer primarily for making cookies. Unfortunately, it is way too powerful for creaming butter and sugar. I ended up getting the sticky mess all over the ceiling. After mixing butter and sugar by hand for a bit and making it less solid/crumbly, the mixer works better and helps you achieve that fluffiness. I wish this mixer had a lower setting. Nevertheless, the beaters themselves are very easy to clean and don't get too much dough stuck on them."
3,speed issue,"not bad for the price, but the motor speeds (3) feel a bit rough from1st gear to 3rd gear."
2,Too powerful!,"This mixer is a great price, however, all 3 speeds are too powerful. The low setting is pretty much non-existant. I can't soften butter on the lowest speed without it splattering all over my kitchen. For serious cooking, I'd recommend you purchase a different mixer."
2,Can't Take the Heat,"I purchased this mixer from Amazon about a year ago and it stripped its gears tonight while I was making cream cheese frosting. I have a large Kitchen Aid stand mixer and used this one only for small batches and light duty. Well, it could not stand the heat so it is on its way out of my kitchen via the garbage."
3,Powerful beater,"There certainly seems to be enough power to beat even the heaviest ingredients. However, it really does not have a low speed for adding in new ingredients. I need to hold the bowl and use care so that the batter does not shoot out.It sure makes quick work of egg whites, though."
4,Nice :),"Bought this for my mother this Christmas. I don't really know too much about it, but she says she likes it a lot. She doesn't use it too frequently, but when she needs it, she tells me that it's pretty much perfect. And I say, it's pretty much perfect too, especially for the price I paid for it!Haven't had issues with it. She says the speeds are just fine, not too agressive at all as long as you keep your mixer in the bowl when you turn it on. It won't splash batter everywhere if you also have a large enough bowl to mix in. But I'll assume that being obvious isn't what some of these reviews would have you think..Good buy overall!"
4,Hand held mixer,"decided to buy a new hand held mixer after nearly 20 years. Bought Cuisinart; know the brand, read the reviews. Satisfied."
4,great mixer,"Great price for a great hand held mixer. I cook daily and love to bake, so we utilize our hand mixer 1-2 times a week or more.I was pleasantly surprised to see that the button to shift speeds was manual and not digital on the 3 speed version. The digital feature seems too complicated for quick, simple jobs. In addition, I don't need that much versatility on a hand mixer as we have a stand mixer for larger or more precise recipes.I rated it 4 stars because I don't think that the cord shifting from right to left is helpful and I miss the old fashioned ""cord winder"" base of my previous hand mixer.This blender has a good slow, medium and fast speed. We are impressed with this basic hand mixer from Cuisinart."
2,Not an all-purpose hand mixer,"This hand mixer probably would be great if I were making bread or something that needed the power that it delivers, but I am not. Unfortunately the low speed is just too fast and I am going to either return it or sell it. When I try and pre-mix sugar and butter I just make a mess because the low speed flings the mixture around the kitchen. It seems well constructed, but I tend to think that hand mixers should be versatile and this one is not. I am going to purchase a mixer with more speeds for finer control."
3,good for the price,"I've had this mixer for a while. I've made gluten-free bread with it, which means it's not as tough as regular bread, but it does climb. I like the long beaters because of that--they are long enough to keep my bread dough out of the casing. Overall, I like it. I don't mind the extra speed--you might need to stir things up a little before you start beating, and yeah, a splatter guard might be a good idea.The reason I'm giving it three stars is tonight I tried to make gingerbread cookie dough with it. It's gluten free, again, so it shouldn't be anywhere near as tough as a wheat flour-based dough would have been, but my beaters bent all to heck. The bars were twisted all around like they'd been in a tornado. I don't mind awfully much shelling out the $15 for new beaters--it beats buying a whole new mixer, but it stings anyway. The beaters should be at least strong enough to handle what the motor can dish out."
1,Poor mixer,"I don't know why people are giving this product such rave reviews. It was working fine for awhile. But the beaters got bent just by putting them in my dishwasher and now the beater sprays anything in a bowl all over the kitchen, literally. I've been talking to the company and trying to get them to replace the beaters, which they said they'd do. But so far no sign and they haven't responded to my emails.My advice would be to not buy this beater. Sacrifice a little money and get something that will last, and work."
3,"powerful,sleek and easy to clean, BUT","it only comes with whisk-like beaters which are not suitable for everything. I bought this particular one because of a Good Housekeeping review...they didn't mention the one set of not very useful beaters...I suppose I could try to find some ';regular' beaters to fit, wish I had bought a different one now, with standard beaters."
3,way too fast!!,"wait!but it was already too late.As soon as I pushed on the button, choosing the lowest speed, all my future cake turned into a new painting in my kitchen...I will never see how good this cake could have been.One thing for sure: next time I won't use this mixer."
4,2 thumbs up,"Bought it for the Mrs. whose top concerns included that it be lightweight. It would be useful for items like this to include weight in descriptions, since I can see that weight could be an issue for some. Anyhow, it worked out fine, and it has lots of torque and she's pleased. She asked me to note that in her long experience, no hand mixer's low speed is ever ""low"" enough."
4,"Very Good Mixer, could be improved a little","I got this to replace an old burnt out Sunbeam. This thing has loads of torque & power. I mainly use it to mix cookie dough, and it had so much torque it bent the heck out of one of the beaters when I was nearly done adding the CCs & Nuts.A few things I would like improved: More heavy duty beaters w/o a point, the ones that come with it the wires just cross on top of each other and creates a point. KA beaters are slightly thicker & do not have a point.1st speed could be turned down a little, it's not as bad as the B&D; MX250 (that thing is a speed demon at 1)Handle & speed switch can be difficult to hold & control when your hands are wet. A textured surface would be nice, or rubber/silicone pads for better grippage.Oh, another thing, replacement beaters are $10 + $5.95 S&H...; over 1/2 the cost of a new one. I've been scavenging Thrift Stores for replacement beaters that would fit, but unable to find any."
2,Starts fast gets faster. awkward cord placement,"I would get a more expensive one that has more speeds. The lowest of the three speeds is almost a whip and the fastest is more like a splatter. Also the cord comes out of a swivel on the bottom, the swivel tends to catch on the bowl while you are mixing if it is too deep."
3,"""Stocking you with the same Stuffing""","Then & Now is re-hashed material from ELP that we've already heard before. It contains 2 cds of live music. The 1st is 2/3s filled with the California Jam concert from the seventies then 1 1/3 disks of good material recently recorded (but nothing new). The sound recording from the 70s is muddled and on both CDs at the end of each song the sound is faded out. This really takes away from the excitment that really could have been. My advice if you only want one live ELP CD set, go with the King Buscuit set that one also has CD-Rom interactive videos and pictures."
4,a good compilation,"This is probably the best compilation that I have heard. I have been a faithful ELP fan since the 1970's, and have bought most if not all of the releases. The excerpts from the California Jam are worth the cost of this CD. This was probably one of their best performances when everything was firing on all cyclinders as they say. The releases from a smaller label company such as this one seem to be better than releases from the major companies. Anyway the California Jam stuff most notably Toccatta have excellent sound quality and make this CD a must buy for the avid ELP fan."
4,Great!,I really like Billy Zane.I think he is not noticed enough.One of the things I enjoyed about this movie was the intense bond that grew between him and Mimi in one night.The Mimi Rodgers character never really revealed her motivations. Interesting.
5,A Lot Softer Than you Know them as Now...,"I have downloaded every track from the original album in as much clarity as I possibly can, and I must say it is a haunting album. As you listen, the emotions generated by the vocals of Amy Lee and the slow moving music are chilling. This album is a lot slower, with a lot of light guitar as well as piano and synthesizers... It really give you the chance to listen to Amy's talent. As you will be able to tell, her voice has progressed so much since this album! However, that does not mean it is bad, not at all. Some of my favorite Evanescence songs can be found on this album. Among the best, I certainly pick ""Lies"", ""Where Will you Go"", and ""Eternal"", not only for their musical quality but also for their touching lyrics. This is a great and rare album, and I'm glad they have reissued it with bonus tracks... I think I'll have to buy it now!"
1,Buy at your own risk,People do not buy this product you can just as easily download the song from the internet even evanescence said they would rather us the fans download the songs than buy the albums and we don't even know if the one your going to buy is a fake or not so don't take that risk just download the songs from itunes or whatever.
3,Wow ... Cool History Lesson,"If you're an Ev fan you need this one to round out your collection. There are some really early workings of ""Imaginary"" and ""Whisper"" that make this a precious find. ""My Immortal"" is on this disc too, but sounds essentially the same, minus the hard rock ending (more of an acoustic end).In my opinion, there are three other songs on this CD ""Field of Innocence,"" ""Even in Death,"" and ""Anywhere,"" plus the ones above, that make it worth the purchase price. I definitely recommend this one to Ev fans and think that most Rock fans would like it as well.Dino SmithChattanooga, TN"
4,Ultimate Twain biography.,"Wordy in places, but still the best, most comprehensive biography of Samuel Clemens."
2,range is horrible,"the range on this product is horrible. i bought it thinking i was getting a good deal because it was [failry inexpensive] after rebate but its not worth the headache. i can hardly keep a connection with the router at the bottom of the stairs and the usb adapter at the top (40 feet, tops) and only one wall in between. if you're planning on staying in the same room as your router, its probably a good deal."
5,Great Product,"No bad words, installation was much easier than I expected.No problems what so ever (even with non Netgear NICs).Strong signal in my apartment, no more cables!I highly recommend buying it!"
2,"Nice, but the range is much less than advertised.","Setting up the router and the USB adapter (MA101) was easy. First I tested with the two computers in the same room. It worked great, with ""Excellent"" signal strength. I then moved computer 1 with the router 40 feet (two rooms) away, in my house. The indicated signal strength dropped to ""Poor"" (1 or 2 out of 5 bars). Transfer speed was still good though--plenty fast enough for DSL communication. However, when the signal was poor, dropouts could occur. Then when I moved the router downstairs 60 feet away, the adapter was NEVER able to connect. Worst yet, whenever the MA101 was plugged in while no signal or the signal was lost, it hung Windows (XP). And the computer must be reset!It simply does not have the transmission range that I needed-I returned the products."
2,"issues with Earthlink DSL, but works fine with SBC Yahoo!","My brother got this for his Earthlink DSL. It never quite worked right. (Both of us took a look at it.) The connection would work for a few minutes, and then disconnect. To reconnect, you had to go through the setup again. This was quite annoying for general web browsing. However, it just won't work with internet gaming.I had an older Linksys router w/o wireless and swapped with him. The Netgear works fine with my broadband service (SBC Yahoo!) I can VPN to work without any problems. The wireless works fine too.As for my brother's Earthlink connection, the Linksys router is as steady as a rock.I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does seem happy with my SBC Yahoo! connection. If given a choice, I'd stick with Linksys."
1,Netgear Nightmare!,"This Netgear router will lose its connection often to wirless cards in computers that have Netgear wireless cards. After ten months in service,the tranmitting mode went out.Called customer service for a RMA number(required) and told to hold for 55 minutes. Never got through! Buy another brand!"
3,"Great Tech Support, Bad System","I recieved this as a gift for christmas and I set it up right away. Then it didn't work, so on CHRISTMAS MORNING I was on the phone for 2 Hours! Then, that night, the network failed! This happened to me about 3 times. The tech support is awesome. It could be a defective router but I do not think so"
2,"Works really well, most of the time","I've been using it for about a 3 weeks. From day 1 it would freeze the wireless connection after some heavy throughput. Strangely, the signal stays good though. I am using a Orinoko card on my laptop. I'm returning it this week."
2,Bad reception,"So much for the miracles of wireless. In order to get reception on my laptop, you basically have to be in the same room as the router. In my bedroom (only 40 feet away from the router), reception is poor or non-existent. According to tech support (nearly impossible to understand through a thick accent), I should be happy to get at least 30 feet inside a house. The great range advertised by this product only occurs in a laboratory. In a real house, you'll be cursing yourself for buying this product."
1,Worst support ever,"They say that they have 24x7 support.But, when I called phone support I had to hang up after being on hold for 45 minutes. And it was the most annoying hold I've ever been on - ""please wait while your call is being routed"" repeated over and over and over again every couple seconds.Their web support is useless for the problems I'm having with port forwarding - one of the more advanced features.I'm getting no answers to my email support inquiries."
3,Doesn't handle ISP gateway switches well,"I have this router and 802.11b rocks... but I've had trouble using it with my Charter (my ISP) cable modem. When Charter resets it's gateway (which is something very common in the ISP industry I guess), the router has to be completly reset (to factory defaults) in order to ""regain"" a connection to the internet. This in itself would only drop the rating to a 4 of 5, but Netgear's backup settings utility seems to back up the old gateway address too, so even after resetting the router to factory defaults and then re-installing your backed up settings, you aren't on the internet. You still need to completely reconifgure the router from scratch... by hand (can be very frustrating depending on the amount of conifguration you want your local intranet to have)."
1,Fustrated user,I purchased the Netgear wireless router and wireless PCI card. The wireless PCI card worked perfectly out of the box. I wish I could say the same for the router.I took three calls to technical support to finally figure out that the router was defective. It could not sychronize the cable modem's signal. The worst part of my experience was the wait time for technical support. I literally had to wait an average of 45 minutes each time I called technical support.I returned the unit and purchased Linksys' wireless router. It worked fine right out of the box.
2,Poor Reception,with no hookup for a Wifi Antenna - Very dissapointed with the technical support reps (and the long hold times!)
1,Not a good wireless access point,"The netgear router is just too basic. It can't set non-standard gateways. Its signal seems pretty weak - only works for about 100 feet. I am off to buy a new one, as I've just had enough of this one."
5,"Works great, easy to set up","I think this router is excellent. It was easy to set up. The documentation is easy to follow and does a great job of leading you through the setup process. Once you get it set up, just put it in a corner and let it do its work. I haven't had any problems with this item."
1,Poor preformance,I am very disappointed with this product. I could not get it to work. The directions were not included (a CD ROM) but I found them online. A computer geek could not even get it to work. Not Recommended by me!
5,Feature rich and fast,"I've installed the RT311, the RT314 and the MR314 in different places and they all worked fine. The throughput is great, I haven't had any problems with getting a VPN connection or network games to work. The best feature is that it can do MAC spoofing to fool the cable provider into thinking I have their network card attached (which is a silly requirement they have here). The only time I needed tech support was when I broke something and they were very helpful in fixing it."
1,Very disappointed,"This unit cannot be used as an access point compared to other units. Also after testing its security through various test sites, grc.com, security.norton.com, and scan.sygate.com this unit does not hide ports as well as other units also. Also static routing seems to interrupt connections. I would not recommend this unit to other people."
2,It's just OK,"I purchaced this router because we share DSL between 4 computers in our house, and we didn't want to run wires all over the place.The router works well, and we've used it for everything from surfing the net, sharing files between computers, and a little LAN gaming action.When I use this router however, sites that you must log into, such as Hotmail, or E-bay, don't work very well. The router has some issues dealing with these types of sites and it always takes me a couple tries to get the websites to work. It's pretty annoying. Other than that it works fine."
2,ok unless using vpn pass-through for 2+ clients,Initial setup was pretty easy. My only issue is I was not able to get more than 1 client to work w/vpn pass-through at the same time. I called their help desk and they gave me a suggestion and said that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I wasn't really able to try their suggestion because I got an error. (they said to map the ports to both ip's which it didnt like) I just switched to a d-link 614+ and I'm now able to have 2 clients use vpn at the same time. Also I would've liked some more security options on the mr314.
2,Thumbs down on security and customer support,"I agree with many of the other customer's comments for this wireless router: it is fairly simple to setup, and it does work as advertised. However, I feel many of the customers have failed to consider one key feature that the MR314 lacks: SECURITY. This brand offers very little in regards to securing your wireless network. There is no way to view a log of successful or failed connections from wireless clients. Almost all other brands have this ability.My particular router locks up after 8-9 day of use and requires a cold boot. Although, this may be a bug in the current firmware that might be corrected in the next version. I've spoken with Netgear's technical support dept and their level of knowledge is no higher than someone who has read the quick install guide for this router."
5,Signature Sound,I like the cd very much. I have enjoyed listening to it and will enjoy it for a long time.
5,ENCOURAGEMENT TO BE YOUR OWN TRAVEL AGENT,"So far, this book is absolutely incredible. The amount of detail is a bit baffling at first, better too much than too little. It gives suggestions for how to find excellent hotels and B&B's, good maps, restaurants, there are even suggestions on packing and keeping a travel journal. We're leaving for the British Isles in a matter of days, and I've been planning for the last 9 months. It would have been so much easier if I'd had this book. I can't wait to start planning our next trip. I don't like to use travel agents because it's been my experience that unless you are paying them to plan your entire vacation, you will be far from the top of their priorities list. Also, it's so much fun to plan your own vacation. This book is invaluable."
5,anglophiles unite,"I've been to England over 20 times and I still refer to Susan Allen Toth's books for help and inspiration.It helps that we share an interest in literature and gardens, but the important thing to me is the quality of Toth's writing and the sheer exuberance she brings to her attitude towards my favorite country.England As You Like It, as well as Toth's other books, is great for dreaming about England, planning to visit England, and reminiscing about your England trips."
2,Is anyone still interested in this stuff?,"OK, so this is member(s?) of an older band called Mohinder, who were actually pretty sweet. Unfortunately, this just isn't all that... it's basically fast screaming chaotic hardcore with some keyboards. blah. Might not be so bad except the production is also pretty terrible, making it really hard to listen to.I'd definitely recommend just picking up the Mohinder discography, which has some real gems. If you're already a mohinder fan and are interested in this, buy with caution."
3,BE CAREFUL,"I read this book, and it was interesting. I even tried a supplement called Cadio Discovery, developed by Dr. Murad, who worked with Ignarro on heart research. Cadio Discovery was sold at Wal Mart but I noticed that they are discontinuing the sales of the product, and the www.cardiodiscovery.com site seems to be permanently disabled. There are reports that L Arginine could be dangerous. In a recent study, men with a history of heart trouble were given L Arginine supplements, and a like group of men were given a placebo. 6 of the men that were given L Arginine died during the study. None of the placebo group died. Please do your research before taking any of these products."
5,No more heart Disease,Great book! Easy to understand. Breaks down what to do and how to do it.what to take take and how to take it for best effect.Shopping guide to supplements. 10 out 10 in my book. Happy I said yes to NO.
1,Doesn't reveal cardiac risk of getting enlarged heart,"It appears that everything in the book does have substantial basis, however, no where does he mention that by taking his recommendations a person risks the possibility of getting an enlarged heart. John Hopkins have done studies this past May which indicate an enlarged heart is a real possibility. So please be sure to always find out the ""bad"" along with the ""good"" which doctors tout even if it means going to other resources to research additional information."
3,ok ...but,I read it and tried the suggested pills . So far it hasnt helped although I did get a little longer affect from cialis. My blood pressure has stayed the same however.
3,No More Heart Disease,Well written easy to read.Very promising health benefits. Finding and keeping up with a number of supplement purchases and cost in Australia is somewhat difficult.
4,Will Benefit Readers Who Take the Advice.,"Information is this book echo's many other books. The information is probably mostly true. Whatever, anyone following this advice has a better chance to live a long life."
4,NO was a confusing acronym,"I have not tried the ideas listed in this book yet - but I plan to. I find it difficult to synthesize the viewpoints of so many experts in the field of nutrition and come up with a truly valuable plan for living. The author, Dr. Ignarro, is a bit repetative but very clear in his ideas. He writes in an organized format and is easy to understand. The fact that he is a Nobel Prize winner gives a great deal of credence to his solutions. I would recommend this book to anyone who is concerned with their health. We must listen to those who speak with wisdom instead of jumping on the bandwagon of the next craze. Why not 5 stars? I always hold one star out for sceptical consideration - After all, cold fusion never materialized."
4,Interesting read.....,"It's a quick read,.....larger print than than usual, the layout is an easy and comfortable format, and the chapters progress in a manner that's pleasant to read....not too technical. The information contained about NO is fascinating,....I've learned so much more about how the body functions, and am definitely considering purchasing the recommended nutraceuticals.....not just another ""how to"" book, though, at times, it reads that way.....helps that the author has won the Nobel Prize...."
3,Too much background,Was ok. He talked too much about how he discovered NO. That part was a bittoo much to slog thru.
4,First thoughts positive,"This book is an easy read and doesn't push his brand of supplements too much. He gives you the actual supplement information so you can get what you need from any source you want. I just started taking (generic) supplements according to his formula (about a week) and I've noticed I am sleeping really well (I didn't make the connection to the suppplements at first, though that is mentioned as a result of supplementation -- the restfulness of the sleep was just that noticeable...we'll see what else happens)."
5,No more heart disease,"This book is the secret to all heart, stroke, and diabetic problems. Dr. Ignarro findings is a modern day miracle. The whole world needs to know about his findings!!!!!!"
2,"Wow, pretty hard core...","Quite simply this book is way too technical in a philosophical manner. I thought the book would simply review the songs, give insight and let the reader get a further understanding to what Neil had in mind when he wrote these songs. I made it through the first few chapters and then decided that this book was too much to handle. It would have been a bit more enjoyable if it examined each song in a ""lighter"" fashion.....I think the average reader will find this to be just too much to sit back, relax and enjoy...."
4,"Interesting book of opinions, but not worth the money!","Generally valid and insiteful analisis of most of the meanings behind Rush's music. Unfortanately, their are no pictures, just a good read. The Price is a bit high for a book full of opinions. If I had seen the book before I bought it, I would have thought twice before buying it. Most serious Rush fans can already decifer the meaning of their lyrics-I suggest you save your money! You could almost buy (2) Rush Cd's for the price of this book. It is also cheaply printed,real cheap cover, ect."
1,"Philosophy Thesis, Save Yourself!",Cannot understand why anyone believed this was worthy of publishing. Reads like the work of a some graduate student. Author uses far too many pages analyzing selected lyrics for philosophical statements. Detailed interpretations are unnecessary. Most of us are smart enough to get the idea without the aid of CLIFF Notes. My recommendation is to borrow it from the library and look this over before spending your money on the book. This style of writing will NOT appeal to many people.
3,INTELLECTUALISM...THAT'S A LAUGH!,"Maybe someday someone will write a book about how Neil Peart's devotion to Ayn Rand's philosophies shown through his lyrics mean that he believes in social Darwinism, euthanasia, and that class separation is necessary and right. He believes that the rich should stay rich and the poor should stay poor. What a jerk!"
1,"The NEW Rush Is Terrible, Who Are You Kidding PRICE?","Your Book is too RACY and for what it is worth, the lyrics of Peart were BETTER with the 1970's RUSH. Your views are YOURS! Racy and CRUDE! Rush will continue and please GIVE IT UP on writing books on RUSH! I rather buy a Biography Picture Book of the band if you ask me. The OLD RUSH WAS BETTER!!!!"
4,BLACKIE ROCKS!,"this is a MUST have!,the camera angles are GREAT!,not too fast, not too slow,and a couple of times the microphones go out,, but its not that noticeable,,all in all, a must have for all W.A.S.P. fans,,the sound is GREAT!, much better than the cd, of the same title, just a great rock and roll show, from start to finish, you will NOT be disapointed, BLACKIE ROCKS."
2,dissapointed,"i bought thid dvd about a year ago and was greatly dissapointed with it. the microphones keep cutting out, there are backing vocals when no-one is singing them and some songs are not full versions.i love wasp but this dvd was poorly produced."
3,wasp fan,"i've been a wasp fan for years,i've never seen them live, so this was the next best thing.video was exciting,as a guitar player ,i,ve always liked chris holmes' playing.this video would only interest wasp fans by in large.if you know their music you'll like it."
2,First off I am a WASP fan and have seen them 7x live............,"I have to say that I had very high hopes for this DVD when I got it a couple of years back. It does have some good tracks on it and its a decent dvd. It just does not have that Blackie Lawless kick to it that you would expect. Also some of the scenes are choppy and the audio does not quite match what the performers are doing. I like WASP and jam to Headless / Unholy Terror etc, and I know that Blackie can out write anyone on anyday. But this dvd falls way short of the quality one would expect."
3,"WASP 2000- Visably Older, Fatter, Slower","I only thought this was an average DVD. There are 2 older VHS concerts from the 80's that I think really captures WASP at their finest. I thought the DVD sounded just OK. Doesn't look like WASP puts much into their stage show these days. The most shocking thing I saw on this video was what a fatso Blackie Lawless has turned into. Almost not recognizable from even a few years ago. He's old, doesn't move around like he used to. I think his shows really lack the energy from the mid 80's. Blackie looked like he was just going through the motions..."
5,surely some mistake!,"No rock discography can hope to contain everything. But the GRD has an amazing wealth of useful information & trivia. Furthermore, I have all three editions -- if it has been re-issued this many times someone must have liked it! If nothing else, it is a vital resource for settling bets..."
3,"well, he did his homework.","i suppose he didnt have a grad student going over his shoulder telling himm that certain people were in a different band or that a member of a band played an instrument other that they were supposed to play....RESEARCH MAN, RESEARCH! I'M A HEAVY METAL DJ and i think i know more that this...if you have as question just ask Garry Sharpe-Young...."
3,Who are these British groups?,"A lot of space is wasted on British groups I have never heard of. Badly Drawn Boy? Anastacia? Cast? Catatonia? Idlewild? Linsdisfarne? And he describes Heart as a folksy pop/rock sound? This book is absolutely irrelevant to the average American reader. If you don't live in a big city with big record stores, this tome is useless."
2,NOTHING OF REAL VALUE,Simply stated ; it just wasn't my cup of tea since it does not list any older music
1,flawed,"I was very irritated to see ""artists"" like ludicris. the rap guy and other rap artists and many more sub-par so called ""artists"" in this ""ROCK"" discography, has the author ever heard of ""the carpenters ""jimmy buffett"" the guess who"" and many many others he left out of this book?? and almost every ""one hit wonder"" group too so many I don't want to type. the reason I gave it one star is because it includes rap ""artists"" augghhh"
4,"Great Resouce, Fun to Read","I love this book. I go back to it time after time to compare notes on my favorite bands, discover new bands, or just pick up some quirky trivia tidbits. Compare it to the latest reissue of the Rolling Stone guide - or try to, because there's no comparison. While some of these guides try to please everybody by delicately balancing rock, blues, pop, rap, etc., Strong mostly sticks with the mainstream of rock and its various alternative and indie offshoots. My only objection is that it is a British creation, and as such I tend to rely less on the evaluations of British bands, which he tends to overrate. The Brits, after all, don't even know who Dave Matthews is! But it's fun to read, the ratings are valuable and realistic (it's not necessary that you agree with them), and the discographies are all-inclusive. I look forward to every new edition of this book, and it's already started to date itself, so I hope the new one comes out soon."
2,"Apology ? not quite, but.......","OK, maybe my earlier review was a little over-critical, but I was trying to convey the point that this book is simply not as good as it SHOULD have been. The omissions are too plentiful and the author's preferences ARE too easily recognised. It is, however, the best attempt at a complete rock discography in recent years. BUT, if you want to see how it SHOULD be done, read Terry Hounsome's ""New Rock Record"", or ""Single File"""
3,Go Big er Go Home,"bought it cus i ddint have the money for the 4 gig at the time, save ur money for the 4 gig"
3,Reader,An interesting account of Jesse James. It seems SO contrary to other Kindle books on the Jameses. Another Kindle selection romanticizes Jesse - from the wife's perspective. It's hard to differentiate the fiction from non-fiction.
4,Hot Girls.....Terrible Music.,"Yes, the 4 hours of dancing is good. You'll see some pretty sweet looking ladies, doing some very good erotic dancing. BUT....you might want to watch this program with the sound off, as you will hear some of the cheesiest, most annoying music with no lyrics to it. Oh man, the music is horrible."
2,Amateurish all the way,"I bought this hoping it would be just some cute girls taking their clothes of. And that's what I got. Still it managed to make me feel disappointed.Sadly, the strippers aren't the only ones being amateurish in this DVD. The whole production is amateurish, even if the picture quality is good enough. The stripping in itself is just not done in a particularly exciting or even tasteful way, it's just like a long wait to see what the girl looks like naked. The whole thing would have benefited from being sped up a bit, I think. Sometimes less is more. If you don't know how to strip then at least don't drag on for too long.One day I might get my own DVD editing program for my computer, and then I'll probably be able to edit together considerably better versions of these 32 strip""teases""."
3,A YOUNG MELISSA HILL,Followers of porn may find this to be a treasure in that it includes a very young Melisa Hill doing a rather modest and subdued strip probably before she went professional.
5,"Gorgeous, memorable album for the whole family","My mother gave us this tape and we have played it nonstop -the songs are haunting, set to melodious music often in minor keys which contributes to the dreaminess (and repeated listenability) of this album. Judy Collins' voice sounds beautiful. My 2-year-old boy loves this recording too, and even my 4-month-old seems to ""settle down"" when hearing it. In fact we bought the corresponding video to see what it ""looked like"" visually. The tape is a must-have, the video very well-done too."
5,Cheap and Cheery,"A superb multimeter for the price. Accurate enough for electrical work (perhaps not at finer tolerances, as the meter's display does not get more accurate than whole volts/amps/watts/ohms).I used to use only Fluke meters, but when they were stolen/misplaced it was quite a hit to my cash flow. I use these now as they function to a much higher level than I would expect for the price, and are easy to replace if they go missing.The shape of the clamp is also nice as it makes snaking the ends in between large gauge wires in a junction box easy."
4,Very good but misplaced realities,"This book and its sequel, Camping in the Backyard:Going Forward, are both very good novels but the author suffers from some misplaced realities. He tries to put gay realities of the 2000s (hate crimes, open displays of gay affection both in public and in front of family and friends, ""don't ask-don't tell"" (hinted at but not directly mentioned), etc...) into a story set in the early 1960s. If the author knew gay history, he would have never put those realities into a story set in the 60s. If he had set it in current day, he would have had a much better novel.Those reviewers complaining about the editing problems should put less blame on the author and understand that is a rather common problem with the publisher, IUniverse."
1,There's always another [writer]...,"I'm starting to feel bad for us readers. These days, any ... writer with an idea, time on his/her hands, and some money can publish a book and get it listed on Amazon. Camping in the Backyard is a perfect example of this. IUniverse does it again - no editing, no spell check, no sense. Are gay readers so desperate for romantic stories that they are willing to praise any book that offers them a little hope at the expense of good writing? I am beginning to think so from this books rank because I found it dreadful. There are so many better authors out there. Zatti, if you read this, I have two words for you next time before you decide to publish a book: writing workshop!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This author cannot spell, has terrible grammar, and totally loses track of his characters in one chapter. A good computer, with spell check, is definitely needed by this author. Plus, NO ONE TALKS like he writes.Because of all the blatant mistakes in writing, this was a hard read, not easy and pleasant as good books are."
1,Time waster,I found this book to be rather poorly written. The author definitely needs to work on his creativity and a more consistant writing ability. The editorial work was poor as well. Definitely not worth purchasing.
1,Material ripped within one day!,"I am very disappointed in the seat cover that I received for Christmas! First of all, there was only one seat cover in the box (not two). I have an '03 Dodge Neon and the cover did not fit very well. It sagged because there was too much material. Then, when I sat on the seat for the first time, the material ripped! The seams are not reinforced at all. Because of the type of material it's made of, it cannot be repaired! My mother is a seamstress and she said that this seat cover was ""cheaply made."""
3,Great design guidline.,I bought the plans as a guideline and then made a bunch of changes to it. I would give it more stars if the dimensions were more clear and an alternate set of hardware finish package was listed on the plans. Also if there was a design were actual ball bearing slides were used that would be great too.If you are seriously going to build based off of these plans you MUST be able to follow a lot of step by step directions that are mostly written with little visual aid.Overall it is a good bang for the buck!
4,Understandable,This plan are very clear and easy to understand. Great cabinet for organizing your sewing area.Wood Plans IFS-#1013 Sewing Center Cabinet
3,Polanki's Macbeth,A little dated - 60s effects and music - but still powerful and true to the play. Old lady nudity is sufficiently appalling.
4,Macbeth DVD,"The Polanski version is an excellent rendition of the play, Macbeth. It is rated R for violence and nudity. However, it is faithful to Shakespeare's tragedy and keeps the audience focused on the events as they unfold quickly and tragically for the Macbeths."
4,The Madness of King Macbeth,"Overall I would have to say that this is quite a dark and disturbing movie, but one that is done quite well. For the era it also has fairly decent production values, but sometimes the sound got rather grainy and crackly. Also, naked old witches and young children were getting just a little disturbing."
4,Definitely not for the faint of heart.,"Macbeth may be studied in school by children, but this movie goes beyond what most children would expect of Shakespeare. Compared to the Expressionistic Orson Welles version (1948), this version is completely in-your-face and doesn't flinch from showing cruelty close up. The killing scenes are enough to make you cover your eyes, although it's hard to imagine they are also in the play itself. For young people who think Shakespeare is boring, this is the film to show them, even if it isn't as emotional and poetic as the Welles version. Be warned, however, don't watch this on an empty stomach."
2,Shakespeare's Classic Butchered,"Polanski's version of the tragedy is far too violent and senseless to be considered Shakespeare. In the tradition of Boorman's Excalibur, this film is made to attract a sleezy audience. Too much nudity, blood and gore, and an extreme emphasis on evil. Of course, it is true to the plot, but it's not the original vision Shakespeare had in mind. It's too disturbing. Perhaps I'm being too judgemental but I believe it is not fair that younger Shakespeare fans should be exposed to this. It is more adult, as is Excalibur, or at least at the High School level. Elementary and junior high students should not view this film."
1,Don't Purchase From This Vendor!!!,I ordered this dvd to show my students and popped it into the DVD player (at home and school) and guess what-- the damn thing didn't work!!! Imagine a classroom full of 30 disappointed adolescents!
5,Brings home that Shakespeare was a master [screen]playwright,"No Shakespeare I've ever experienced did half as much as this movie did to make Shakespeare real, vivid and fascinating -- as a storywriter. Its verisimilitude (sp?), its acting, and the directing served to get me caught up in the STORY in which people just happened to talk in that older, poetic tongue. A facinating story by a fantastic playwright who happens to be named Shakespeare."
4,Macbeth,"Good version of Shakespeare's play, well adapted to the cinema language by the director of Repulsion, Rosemary's baby and The Death and the Maiden (Ariel Dorfman's play)."
4,Macbeth Review.,"Well, what can I say. The movie itself was well done. The incorporation of the dark and halogenic atmosphere portrayed in the original play was well matched in this production. The acting was very stable and excellently delivered, and the use of the silver screen makes it possible for the average individual to understand Shakespeare more, even though the language is still bloody impossible to figure out... However, the film had setbacks: for instance, the music sounded terrible, much like a quadropolegic monkey was being pushed through a pipe organ. As well as that, many scenes were left on the cutting room floor and not expressed in the film, leaving some innaccuracy to be seen. Nonetheless, it was an excellent film with very high standards for being a quality piece of Shakespearean work."
3,macbeth review,"Roman Planski did a generally good job at portraying macbeth as a film. I understand that the movie was made in the 1970's so it was kinda bad quality and some scenes were poorly made, for example the scene with the floating dagger and the fight scene at the end between Macbeth and Macduff. It kind of ruined my idea of it. But nonetheless it was an alright movie. I really enjoyed how Polanski showed the witches, and the added scene at the very end where it shows Donald Bain going to visit the witches, leaving that bit of open interpretation. It was an interesting way to end it."
2,Is this as good as it gets?,"This film is produced by Hugh Heffner's Playboy productions, which allowed the production staff a great deal of freedom when it came to finances and expenditures. Heffner's attempt to be a part of the fabric of our culture seems to be the best film version of Macbeth, however that is not saying much. This is a film that desperately needs to be made again...Lady Macbeth does not give even a lackluster performance, Macbeth is stoic and doesn't give the character any depth. Perhaps we could get a joint venture soon with Baz Luhrman and Kenneth Brannaugh."
3,macbeth,"Roman Palanski did a generally good job at portraying macbeth as a film. I understand that the movie was made in the 70's so it isn't the best quality. Some scenes were poorly made for example when Macbeth sees the floating dagger infront of him, and the fight scene between Macduff and Macbeth at the end was quite disapointing because it kind of ruin my idea of it. But nonetheless it was an alright movie. I really enjoyed how Palanski showed the witches, and at the very end of the movie, when he added that last scene where you see Donald Bain going to see the witches, ending it with that bit of open interpretation. It was interesting how he did it."
4,Atmosphere is the Strong Point of this Version,"Roman Polanski's MacBeth is a particularly bloody rendition of the play - the battle and murder scenes are a bit of a shock if you're used to, say, Orson Welles' version, or the old BBC one with Nicol Williamson. John Finch plays a fine, strapping MacBeth - his performance is as good as his Henry IV done for the BBC a few years back. He and Lady MacBeth are young and beautiful, one of the first times they were portrayed this way, to make a contrast with their bloody deeds. The fine, weird score and the often rainy, muddy scenes add much to this production, which might not be for everyone but is certainly decent enough to watch in order to have another version on hand with which to savour the poetry. Polanski made this film soon after his wife, Sharon Tate, was killed by the Manson gang; it is thought (how could it be thought otherwise?) that he put his upset into the ""look"" of this film."
5,As good as yer gonna get,"I like this film because it stuck to the text, didn't switch things around, had a good atmosphere to it, and was unflinching in its portrayal of Shakespeare's descent into the heart of evil. It's not for the kiddies. But then, the play isn't, either. A few minor quibbles, sure, but all in all a powerful cinematic experience which might show you the bard in a new light."
1,I can't believe he made MacBeth boring!,"This has to be the most boring MacBeth I have ever seen!!!! I love Shakespeare and different interpretations, but this one was unbelievable. The only things remotely interesting were the naked witches and that was interesting only because it was weird. Really, why would witches run around naked in a very damp and cold looking Scotland? I actually fast-forwarded through the movie I was so bored. The actors had the charisma (for the most part) of dead fish. The only one who seemed flesh and blood was Banquo. Even Lady MacBeth was rather dull, though the fact that she looked the epitome of a California girl was interesting. Basically, rent it once. Do not buy it!!!!!"
2,Amanda Caldwell-enrichment,"Mr. Yochum's Senior English ClassI think that this movie version of Macbeth just did not live up to my expectations. I thought that Polanski's version was quite boring to say the least. Not that it depicted the play badly but the characters were poorly picked and didn't act very well. I did like the bloody fight scene between Macbeth and Macduff in the end. However, it sort of made me laugh more than anything. Although, the acting wasn't quite up to par, the motif of hands was still used just like in the play. I think Polanski followed Shakespeare's metaphorical use of hand imagery well here by showing the scene with Lady Macbeth sleep walking. Maybe I am to young to judge such a old classic but overall i thought it was pretty cheesy."
5,Macbeth,"The movie itself is one I have always loved and used for my English IV classes. I was not able to find it anywhere until it came out on DVD and Amazon had it available. The movie was in excellent condition, and rest assured, it arrived in a timely manner. I was able to get my students on track within a week viewing the film and working the essays.Thank you Amazon.Ms. Egly"
3,Worthwhile but Dated!,"It must certainly be a daunting task to adapt a Shakespearean play. In this 1971 production, Roman Polanski chooses to show very explicitly many events that occur off-stage in the theatre, for instance Macbeth's stabbing of the king and in the end his own beheading.Was the intention simply to be more cinematographic or, given the movie was produced by Playboy, to shock the audience and stir up publicity?In any case, 40 years later, these elements fall a bit flat as viewers are now regularly exposed to much more violence and nudity. Compared to say `Titus', a more recent adaptation of a work by Shakespeare, this `Macbeth' appears almost mild."
4,Middle Age tragedy,"This is a serious attempt to Macbeth's story. In spite of being a Playboy production and some perhaps unnecessary nudes, the tragedy is faithfully told. Shakespeare love for violence and the supernatural is well known and this film makes justice, I believe, to the playwright's intentions. In his stage he could not show much of the actual violence such as is depicted in the movie, but this was more because of the limitations of the time, rather than because the audience did not love blood. Remember that public executions were commonplace in Shakespeare's England.One of the best aspects of the film is the geography, the atmosphere, the gray and hostile texture. Tragedy is implicit in the rainy weather, the bleak stones, the barren fields.An aesthetic experience not to be missed."
2,Mr. Yochum's Senior English Class,"After reading the play, I was looking forward to watching the movie, thinking that maybe it would change my mind about the play. However, it didn't turn out to be what I expected. The movie made it hard for me to stay awake during class. I thought that the scene where the forest came towards Macbeth was portrayed poorly. I could barely tell that they were trees that the soldiers were carrying. Also, the fighting scene at the end was very unrealistic, which disappointed me because it was the scene I was looking forward to the most. This scene was not suspenseful, it was just amusing. I feel that the director could have taken more time to make the movie more believable. Although parts of the movie were not portrayed as clearly as the play, I did enjoy some parts of it. I would advise you not to buy the movie due to the fact that it is way over priced."
4,Macbeth,The movie Macbeth was a good movie. After reading the play the characters were exactly what i thought they would look like. The movie followed the play well. Some parts were added into the movie that were not in the play so it was kinda neat to see some extended senses. The movie was good to watch and made the play more sense because it's easier to see what's happening in the play on t.v then reading it.
5,I still love her,"Joan Jett rocked my word when I was about 18 - 20, then somehow I let her go. When I read that this albume was more like her earlier work I was all over it. I'm glad I did."
2,over-produced and under-inspired,"I am Joan Jett's biggest fan, but this album is disappointingly mediocre. Four or five of the songs are okay, the rest aren't. Just look at the cheesy band photo and you get an idea of the cliched hard rock sound. The production is way too clean and sterile. Joan, please get Rick Rubin to produce your next record!"
5,Hotter than ever,"Ever since I saw the film The Runaways last weekend, I had been checking out the music by The Runaways as well as Joan Jett via the internet. Today I had a strong urge for some Joan Jett so I went out and bought her album Sinner. Regardless of age, Joan Jett still sounds amazing as ever with her raspy vocals. Time has not affected her vocal chords. She sounds as good as she did when she was with The Runaways. Her songs on Sinner are fast, raw, and catchy. Songs like ""Riddle"" and ""Androgynous"" (excellent cover of The Replacements). In this day and age of disposable pop music, it is great to see artists like Joan Jett still putting out good, quality music that is able to stand the test of time. With the release of The Runways movie, I do hope that the public will re-discover Joan Jett's music."
4,Joan Jett is finally back!,"And with an album that's quite good for a Joan Jett studio record. ""Riddles"" is a standard fare type of song (blues/rock) for Joan and good way to start the album. Following that we get the first single/video, a cover of The Sweet's ""A.C.D.C."" which she does very nicely (and the video is pretty darn good too). There is a slightly disappointing version of ""Andrognyous"", which sounds a bit watered down; it's shame because the song works so well in her live show. However, for the most part this album rocks, and in some cases - ""Change The World"" and ""Tube Talkin"" - it rocks hard and fast. Worth your time to pick this one up and enjoy."
3,"A""sinner 'of a CD",As i listen to this CD one thought came to mind.I waited 10 years for this!!The best song here is A.C.D.C.I'm used to Joan rerecording old Runaways songs but here she redoes an old Blackhearts song(100 Feet Away}which was better with the original lineup.Not terrible but I'd rather hear Pure & Simple for the 1000th time
2,"Remade, re-recorded, re-released","Most of this album was released as NAKED in 2004 in Japan. A couple songs were released in 1999 on a Jett compilation cd FETISH. A few of these tracks are re-recorded songs from previous albums. There are 2 covers. Those are the best tracks...but then again, the covers usually are the best tracks on any Joan Jett album."
1,Joan Jett Needs To Shut Her Stupid Mouth,Joan Jett used to be an artist who I liked until this joke. Her idea of making fun of the president just sets me off. She is an idiot and needs to leave politics out of her music. She is just another worthless liberal. I will never listen to this album again. She deserves 0 stars.
3,"Don't hate it,but don't really appreciate it either!","This album/recording is ok,but I like the original 100 times better! Some of the artists here are not to bad,but I think some of them were looking for a way to make a 'fast buck' and should be ashamed they did what they did on this recording! I will always be a fan of Peanuts and the gang,but this recording is not on my top lists of remembering Charlie Brown. Like I said above,I don't hate it,but I really don't appreciate it either!!"
1,I'll add my two cents,"If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. This is one of the most disappointing CDs I've bought in the last decade. I can't really expand on the other reviewers, but suffice to say avoid this one like the plague.And yes, the 1-star reviews ARE fair. Vince Guaraldi is probably rolling in his grave after this wretched ""lite jazz"" interpretation.4 of the 12 tracks have nothing to do with ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" as we know and love it. I'm all for re-interpreting classics in fresh, new ways. I'm all for celebrating old favorites in fresh, new ways.This is new, but it is not fresh and is certainly nothing to celebrate."
1,The Trashing of a Christmas Classic,"Need I say anything more?!? They should have left well enough alone with this one. Vince Guaraldi was a genius who's work cannot be improved upon no matter how many so-called big name artists you put on a CD. Pheeewwww, this one stinks!!!"
3,Dissappointed,I too was dissappointed as I was looking for something closer to the original soundtracks. There are still good pieces on the album though - would have been more dissapointed if purchased at full price.
1,HATED IT!!,"This is the most awful rendition of this CD I have ever heard. It was misrepresented as the same music, and it is NOT. The original is far better than this awful version."
2,Do Yourself A Favor - Buy The Original,"Some things can't be improved upon. There is a reason you can buy this CD used on Amazon for only $1.00. If you don't own the original, you are missing one of the best Christmas CDs of all time. Skip this, and get the original."
1,YIKES!!! A BIG disappoinment.,"The only thing I can say echoes what already has been said; ""Why this album? Why this collection? Why these artists?"" Obviously to cash in in some way. ""Good luck, Chuck""(as Lucy might say).The instrumentals are okay, but Chaka Khan should be given a larynx-ectomy for what she does to Torme's lovely chestnut,""The Christmas Song"".Get the originals. 'nuff said!!"
3,Charlie Brown Lite,"Less filling--not quite the taste, but some portions are lovely. I don't appreciate the 4 added numbers unrelated to the original. They don't add to the theme and just seem like 'filler.' to me. Well done work, but I would much rather someone went in and re-mastered the original Guaraldi."
2,Most underachieving Holiday music collection of all time?,"The original Vince Guaraldi Trio 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' is one of the the all-time classics for both jazz fans and lovers of Holiday music. As such, any attempt to re-do the work in its entirety-even by the best talent in the Jazz world- will struggle to reach that high bar. Trumpeter Rick Braun's version of 'My Little Drum' by sounds really nice, and Dave Koz's sax refreshes 'Linus and Lucy' well enough, but it seems like most of the other artists just showed up for the paycheck. The result is a mixed bag, and being as each track features a different jazz artist, there isn't even any real pattern throughout. Chaka Khan's rendition of 'The Christmas Song ' may be the worst ever recorded. Jazz snobs may get it, those particular to the simple beauty and unique flow of the original may not."
4,Good product,"Looks nice, has a comfortable grip and works well with good response time. However, the controller vibrates furiously on the right side and not so much on the left which I think is kinda wierd."
5,Very good gamepad for the pc,"I bought another one of these for another computer, because I enjoyed the last one for my main. Its a great gamepad to use for the games 4 windows labeled games, also for the non labeled games too.I just wish it was a tad smaller."
5,Great PC controller,"This is an excellent controller. The ergonomics are perfect, all the buttons are exactly where you want them, and best of all, it works with PC as well. I don't own an Xbox, I stumbled on the fact that these worked with computers while looking for ways to convert a Dualshock to USB. I am glad I decided to get the Xbox 360 controller, because it is leaps and bounds better than the Sixaxis or Dualshock.One gripe I have with it is that the vibration doesn't work at all. It might be the game I am playing, though. It would be awesome if it were wireless too."
1,Not Good At All,"The 1 star was VERY Generous. Controller came early. Only Wonderful part of the purchase. Within 5 minutes, the controller was useless. Wires shorted out. Returning ASAP."
1,Bad,"This controller is bad. The day I received it, it was bad. The controller was not working as good as i read it was. You have to move the cable a lot in order for it to work. Also when you play, the controller can get u mad because it disconnects by itself in the middle of anything."
5,Great controller,I didn't even realize that I was able to buy a wired controller for my XBox 360 until coming onto Amazon. I thought they were all completely wireless. I just couldn't afford the batteries all the time. There were no technical errors with this product. No damage to the product or it's packaging. Great company to order through.
1,"Fake, or used!","I cannot believe Amazon just let this product survive here! It`s totally not as described!They send me a plastic paper packed ""new real Microsoft X360 controller"", no guide book, no official mark, I never know that Microsoft is also a plastic factory.And when I look at back, OMG! Guess what I see? I see 4 familiar Chinese characters ""&#20013;&#22283;&#35069;&#36896;(Made in China)"" and it`s even written in tranditional Chinese! Chinese mainland never use tranditional Chinese so I guess it`s some fake product selling to Hongkong, Macau or Taiwan.Another thing I want all you buyers know is that I`ve seen the same kind of ""real controller"" selling in my hometown Nanjing about 3 years ago and it was priced 120 RMB(Which is way better, at least they have good package), you have to know Chinese RMB to US dollar was about 1:7 that time. They are just marked ""furbished"".You know how to do with your order now..."
4,Great controller,"Best controller to use for playing PC games. Previous purchase of generic brands PC controllers were all useless. This came with a free USB connector and Amazon has the best deal so far for this controller. It's computable with all current PC games and even the old ones as far back as 4 years. Should work with even older games.Works great under Vista.I gave it 3 stars originally because when I read it, it asked, ""How do you rate this game"". Since this clearly wasn't a game, I gave it 3 for netural.... Anyways, fixed it to 4 stars."
4,Flawless but unneeded,"Based on the old Xbox S-controller with added bumpers. This controller can turn on/off the 360, act as a remote, connects to a headset, etc... It rumbles -- the $600 PS3 doesn't. It works perfectly but since the wireless controller exists, also works perfectly with a long battery life, and the price range is so reasonable, this controller is not the correct choice.The wireless controller connects FLAWLESSLY. Never fails to connect and the connection never drops, ever, even though it's wireless. Battery life is extremely LONG - you'll be able to use the thing forever without recharging. Attachements exist for charge & play, Accessories for quick charge. Options for regular or rechargable batteries.The wired controller is simply unnecessary. Get the wireless controller. It's not like a cell phone. It won't drop out on you."
3,No Vibration Feedback!,"The controller works great! However, the description does not inform the buyer that there is no vibration feedback within the controller. I am currently using the controller as a gamepad for my PC. It is compatible with Vista Ultimate - 64bit and works properly without any problems. If you are looking for a gamepad with vibration feedback, do not purchase here. Look for ""Xbox 360 Controller for Windows."""
2,Not cool.,"I bought this expecting to get months of great play of of it. Most disappointed. The game characters moved independently without my commands, an important piece was missing when the product got to me and plus it got to me kind of late. Most disappointing."
4,Get wired!,"I really like this wired controller. The cord is long so I don't have to sit on the Tv and it takes no batteries, so as I'm fighting some boss I don't have to stop and change batteries! Cheaper then I found in stores."
3,Xbox 360 Wired 'troller review,"Good product, nice price and quick delivery. Not quite the condition I expected with some buttons pretty unresponsive but on the whole can't complain as it still works well"
3,Works well only 1 problem,"The controller works fine, it is used so I expected a bit of wear and tear. The only problem is that when a microphone is plugged into it it makes a constant low pitched tone right in your ear."
5,great buy,"after considerable shopping around for a wiered xbox 360 controller i finally decided on this one. when it arrived it was in perfect condition and worked great. however if you are not like me and want things rapidly quick then go with a new one from amazon , because for only 2o r 3 dollars more and a longer shipping time you can get a new one."
5,Great controller,"This controller is great,i prefer it over the wireless cause it costs less and you don't have to worry about batteries.it is also lighter than the wireless."
4,Xbox 360 Controller-A Good Buy,"When the controller arrived it was in perfect condition and came with an easy to understand manual. You can either plug it into your 360 or you can use it as a PC gamepad, which is a pretty nifty feature that I'm sure PC gamers will be thankful for. Overall, its a good choice but I would suggest the wireless controller if you're willing to give another ten dollars."
5,Works just as I expected.,"The controller plays just like I would expect it to: perfectly. There are no problems I have it; the buttons and analog sticks work like they're supposed. Also, since it was manufactured by Microsoft, it's fully compatible with Windows OSes and Xbox, all you have to do is plug it in and you're ready to go. The nine-foot cable it comes with enables you to play from away from your xbox or computer from a fairly great distance, good for those that want to lie in bed or on their couches that also don't want to shell out the extra cash for both a wireless controller the wireless receiver that you need for it.Overall, I am happy I bought it, as it has greatly enhanced my experiences with some of my games (heck, there are even games I'm playing more often since I this controller). For that, I award it five stars."
4,Good customer service,"I received my controller within 5 days. However, the first controller didn't work at all. I contacted the seller who gladly sent another one and didn't ask me to send the broken one back to avoid extra shipping cost for me. The second controller I received works perfectly. Overall this had been a pleasant experience."
1,Controller didn't work,I got the controller and it doesn't work. I plugged it i and it doesn't turn the xbox on and it doesn't say its on.
5,good controller,"Doesn't get much better than an xbox 360 wired conroller. Works perfectly in windows as well. I always prefer wired over wireless (for the most part)...never have to worry about syncing controller, batteries and all that junk. Just keep it simple."
4,Great Xbox 360 Controller,"I bought this one to play GTA IV in my pc, it works great after I download the drivers from microsoft web site. Don't give a 5 because the directional button is a kind of ""sticky"" moving to the right."
5,Great PC Gamepad,"This was a great purchase. Not only does it work on my PC, but it also works on the XBOX 360. Playing old games on the computer was a pain with the keyboard and now feels comfortable with this controller."
3,just ok,This controller was new in the package just as described but it had residue on the inside that made it take forever for the joystick to get broken in. If i turned either joystick to the side it took forever to react even after I changed settings. It just seemed like it was stuck or something was keeping it from going.
4,Controller,the XBox 360 controllers are better than the XBox controllers. They feel more ergonomic. My only problem with this one was that I thought I was getting a wireless. My Bad. But the cord is long enough that it's not an issue to sit on couch and still play comfortably
4,handy for pc gaming,"i bought it solely for playing on pc (i already have wireless controllers for xbox 360), and it works like a charm in most games. real good pc controller."
4,Stick with 1st Party Controllers,Controller wroks great for both Xbox 360 and PC. I've bought the Modern Warfare 2 Xbox 360 Combat Controller before but I didn't like the shoulder buttons so returned it and bought this instead.
1,"Cheap, plastic feel and complete waste of money","I bought this controller because I am the type of player who only plays on wired controllers. I prefer both the feel and dependability of these controllers and I've had a lot of good luck with them in the past. I suppose I was due for some bad luck or something, because this controller was the worst I've ever felt. The feel was completely wrong. It even felt incredibly light when I held the package for the first time. As far as the functionally goes, the controller was unplayable. The joystick felt as though it had been damaged already and passed off as ""new"" or something. I'm completely unhappy with the product I received. In defense of the seller, the item did ship here quickly despite being in Okinawa, Japan. I would highly discourage anyone from purchasing this controller from this seller. I basically am out the price of the controller as I am far too frustrated to deal with the arduous return process. Anyhow, buyer beware for sure."
5,Loved it,"I usually hate wired controllers, yet XBOX 360 controllers come with batteries that you have to replace so it is so much more convenient to have the wired one because I do not have to replace batteries. Very well made. Still have my battery operated ones but seem to use the wired more. The wire is really long so you can sit a good distance from the television and still have slack with the cord."
5,Really good product,I use it for working my 126 pound rottie in NoseWorks. Easy to let slid between your fingers without burn.
1,Wrong DVD Cover,I purchased this DVD - Carl Perkins and Friends - Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session which was released in 2002. Another DVD called Blue Suede Shoes was released in 2006. I knew the DVD's were exact but I figured the covers were different. When it was shipped I found out it was the exact DVD and cover which I already had from the 2006 release. The DVD is awesome but you need to advertise the correct cover. This DVD shipped was the same cover as the Blue Suede Shoes cover released in 2006.
4,Soooo Pure,"Carl Perkins was and still is a foothold on the rockabilly scene. Early forms of rock are here and everywhere in this performance of a lifetime simply because of the down to earth feeling it has. George Harrison is true to form here as well as Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and all the other guests that make this a real toe tapper no matter where you are in music."
2,"Great video, lousy sound","Don't get me wrong, I love this video! The music is fantastic, which is the whole reason I bought this on DVD. But the sound quality is terrible. Maybe there is something wrong with my DVD. I'd be interested if anyone else who owns this DVD is having the same problem?"
5,Great Rock & Roll,"This is a great show honoring the great Carl Perkins. I actually recorded this on VHS when it was aired on TV during the late '80's.Highlights for me, like the others who have reviewed it, are Ringo and George who are clearly having a blast singing and playing with one of their heroes. Everyone's love and admiration for Carl P. is obvious and very moving. Final note: I agree with some others who have opined that this show captures the best playing Clapton has done in the past 25 years, or more. I know it's heresy to say that he usually bores me. Maybe he came to life here because of Carl's presence, or maybe I just like him a lot better playing rockabilly. Regardless, this is a show for Carl, a true founding father of rock & roll, and, like him, it's a great one."
2,Gossipy Book for Rainy Days,"This book is not a serious book, though it is fun for when you are boerd. All in all, this book is not worth the price. It is predictable with no solid plot."
2,Anime Cheese,As anime goes this one is fluff. Don't get me wrong I've seen worse but for the most part I've seen much better. this anime is just plain corny. the story is weak and well everything about it is cheese and not even good cheese like cheese whiz dairy by-product avoid or it might give you gas.
4,Music videos from Devil Hunter Yohko!,This VHS tape is a collection of music videos from the anime - Devil Hunter Yohko. It contains several animated and LIVE ACTION music videos (The live action music videos star the voice actresses from the anime). If you are a fan of Devil Hunter Yohko you must get this video!
4,Yohkorific,Devil Hunter Yohko is a great anime series in my opion. The anime has great battle action and fun comic releif in the story. Yohko always is serious in one part of the story line and a total goofball in another part of the story. The way Yohko and her friends have to deal with what's happening around gets to be the some of the best anime sences I have seen. I am sure that once you watch Devil Hunter Yohko you will feel the same way I do about the series.
5,Collector Resource Book,I have read a number of books on Winchester Firearms. I especially liked this one. Anyone who reads this book will learn something new.Things I picked up.Until now Winchester never produced a factory 410 guage lever action shotgun.Half Octagon/ Half Round Carbines are very rare. Take a lookat the Lone Star Commemorative.
5,Well Done,"As soon as I began reading this book in Barnes & Noble, I knew I wanted to have it for my research library.It is extreemly well researched. The quality and sharp detail of the back & white pictures are excellent as well. The author know the Winchester 94 in and out. The book was a bargain on Amazon. A coffee table quality book that will supply hours of interest and accurate information on one of the mainstays of Americana."
5,Winchester Way,An effective and detailed accounting of an American firearm that is a legend and an American Icon of engineering and craftmanship from our American forefathers. The book highlights the lifecycle of this American legend causing all who read to pause in appreciation that our American industrial giants had the ingenuity to design such a refined rifle.
2,MODEL 94 COLLECTORS,"AS A LIFELONG COLLECTOR OF WINCHESTER RIFLES, I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING SOME NEW AND DIFFERENT INFORMATION. UNFORTUNATELY, THE BEST THING ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THE COVER. MOST ALL THE INFORMATION HAS ALREADY BEEN PRINTED AND REPRINTED ELSEWHERE. FOR A BEGINNING COLLECTOR OR ENTHUSIAST, THIS IS, HOWEVER, A GOOD REFERENCE BOOK TO START WITH."
4,"Laugh out loud funny with poignant moments, too...","The title of this book should really be GINGER PETROCELLI'S BAD SUMMER, but LOOSE SCREWS is appropriate, too. *G* After being jilted at the alter, Ginger's old ""virginator"", Nick, now a cop, shows up at her door nearly accusing her of doing a foul deed in conjunction with her fiance's disappearance. Not only that, after subleasing her apartment for five years, the original tenant informs Ginger she's coming back so Ginger needs new digs. After finding said new digs Ginger is burned out of her new home and ends up living with Mom and Grandmom. Not a good thing.The story snowballs from there with many humorous laugh-out-loud moments, but plenty of poignant, angst-filled ones included, as well.Karen's classic characterization, dialogue and storyline shine in this modern day PERILS OF PAULINE and I highly recommend it as a terrific, take-your-mind-off-your-own-troubles book!"
3,Predictable!,"After the first few chapters, it was obvious that everything was going to go wrong in the life of poor Ginger, the main character in the book. It takes a while to get into it, and by the time it starts getting good-it ends. The whole book in itself seemed kind of pointless and you were left feeling like you accomplished nothing by reading it. It IS good for a few laughs, but don't expect to come away feeling refreshed."
3,Italian anyone?,"If you want a light read to get you through the summer, here's your book. Easy-going, slightly predictable plot, but cute, loveable characters.Things every woman wants...""I still want to believe there's a good man out there whose smile is gonna make me grateful fo every breath I take.""Things every woman knows...""A woman who pleases her husband in the kitchen can count on him pleasing her later in the bedroom.""Enjoy this sweet twist on ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" characters."
2,Boring,"I could not get through this book. I thought it might just take a couple of chapters to get into the story, but the story never took hold. Totally boring."
4,Funny and light...sexy too,"This is the story of Ginger Petrocelli and her dysfunctional mother & friends, told by Ginger herself (Bridget Jones style).Having been deserted at the altar by her husband-to-be, Ginger runs into bad luck time & time again (not to mention hunky policeman Nick!) that forces her to re-evaluate her life, lover & her career.I laughed out loud many times reading this book, it is a thoroughly enjoyable romance. The characters are real, the story is enjoyable & sexual tension is great.A must read for romance lovers."
4,A complete story,"It was really a luck that I was able to find this book in India. After reading the other sequels ,I was really in need of this book and its comes very true to me.It is definitely a great sequel to the saga written by k.s.prichard and it keeps you interested till the end. All the charecters are grand and complete ,but they all seems to be like the people around you."
2,It's missing some of the good stuff!,"Some of the highlights of this concert were the offbeat moments (i.e.Bowie opening w/America accompanying himself on a little casio).Some of these moments are here. But some musical highlights are missing. Most notably, Macy Gray's incredible funk/reggae version of ""with a little help from my friends"". The song is listed on the song list on this site...but it's not actually on the album. (...)"
5,Excellent,Now this is what music is all about. It was the best concert I've seen in years. To see all these people together in one concert was amazing. I loved it.
3,Not quite as expected,"The works program loaded successfully as did a potion of the others included in the package. However, it would not download all of the discs due to a lack of necessary file programming and kept popping up a window telling me so. I didn't think I needed the mapping program anyway, and the other files weren't important to me either so I didn't bother trying to resolve the issue. By and large however, I am pleased with the product, and would reccommend it to others."
3,Carole King - Simple Things,"'Simple Things' is a really nice and hard to find album. It's pleasant but not so good as her famous ""Tapestry"". I like the songs ""To Know That I Love You"", ""In the Name of Love"" and, of course, ""Hard Rock Cafe""."
4,"Beautiful looks, Beautiful sound","This bass is a beautiful piece. Its a nice flat wood, it is very smooth and all around nicely crafted. The sound is incredible, having the 3 band EQ is a plus. You can be playing a smooth bass line and with the twist of a knob you have a steely sounding slap bass. Fantastic bass!"
5,Excellent book!!!,"I highly recommend this book. I took a college course and we used this book. It is a very balanced book and looks into all areas of Eustress (good stress), Neustress (neutral stress) and distress (bad stress). It gives a plethora of step by step information on many different techniques into managing and eliminating stress. It was so helpful to me, I decided to keep the book once my class was over. There is also an excellent accompanying journal called Managing Stress ""A Creative Journal"" you can buy to go with it."
5,Managing Stress - An Excellent Textbook,"I had checked out this book from the college library and had found it so packed with information that I needed that I had to have my own copy. When the textbook came, I was delighted to find that a workbook was included in the price of the book. I am thoroughly pleased with it."
5,"""A ""PERFECT"" MAJOR LABEL DEBUT...""","was this album back in 1974. With the hit single ""Lovin' You"" leading the way, Minnie put together an album that exposed the world to this fine singer-songwriter. It's an original work, one that could be called ""Neo-Soul"" for its time. Minnie touches on a wide range of influences with this project. The rockin' ""Everytime He Comes Around,"" the jazzy ""Take a Little Trip,"" the ""Stevie Wonderish"" ""Perfect Angel."" All the tunes are interpreted in a unique, special way and Minnie touches your soul through her amazing voice, the voice of an angel. Those who thought Minnie was a one hit wonder found out otherwise with her second album, ""Adventures in Paradise"" which further showcased her original talent, a talent we still miss to this day. ""Perfect Angel"" is just that: PERFECT IN EVERY WAY and a CLASSIC!"
3,Decent movie,"This movie was good enough for me to order it for my mother. I'm not sure if she watched it yet, or not to ask her how she liked it. I saw the movie on one of the premium movie channels during my 3 free months. I rather enjoyed the movie. It was good enough for me to actually sit there, and watch from beginning to end. If a movie isn't good, I'll get up, and do something else while its on. It has some action in it, and it has a pretty decent plot. It's worth while."
5,Eloise at Christmas,"I love this DVD, but it was supposed to have a bonus Eloise ornament inside, which was not there. I was really disapointed. Would still like to have it, if possible."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"This Eloise movie is not an animated one. My daughter saw this movie several years ago and has wished for it ever since. She's 15 years old now, but when I found it on Amazon, I thought I'd surprise her with it! She loved it! It was exactly what we wanted. We also saw another Eloise un-animated movie that we may buy in the future!"
4,Eloise,"Eloize is a happy child, who lives with her nanny in the Hotel Plaza. She knows the character's people. In way to much confusion she joins hearts and says the proprietary's hotel that he must be benefic with an aged guest."
4,Fun for kids,I ordered this for a Christmas gift and it arrived very quickly. The young girl it was for is in mid elementary school and she loves this movie. As she watched it her younger sister (about 2nd grade) began watching with her. She loved it too. Lots of fun and Holiday stuff for the kids without being too disclosing or full of unchildlike content.
5,A Really Fun Christmas Movie,"""Eloise at Christmastime"" takes some of the characters from ""Eloise at the Plaza"" and deepens them, bringing the relationships into further development, while adding a new storyline, as well. The new storyline involves the Plaza owner, his daughter, and one of the staff members that appears in ""Eloise at the Plaza."" It is a charming story of mystery and romance with Eloise once again in her exceptional role as a mischievous, but good-hearted child who only wants to make other peoples' lives better while having some fun along the way. Her antics are believable from a child's point of view and never have any lasting damaging effects, although they can be temporarily uncomfortable for those around her. This has become part of my Christmas tradition every year, even though my children are now grown. The music is wonderful in this movie (especially the Christmas songs), everything comes out right in the end, and all the purity of innocent childhood is there."
3,Not available on CD anywhere else,"This album is not available on CD anywhere else to my knowledge. I don`t really care for Lamas as a singer or actor with his thick accent, perhaps that`s why this album is difficult to find on CD. I only needed it for my collection. Sound quality (mono) is very good."
4,Honest look at the humanity of Jesus,A brief imagined account of Jesus' boyhood from about 8 years old through the Crucifixion. Eye-opening approach to the human side of Jesus. Very worth reading.
1,Poor Quality!,"I purchased this starter not hardly 2 months ago and the electrical wiring burn up in it. Had it replaced with an AC-Delco by GMC, (although high cost, should have went this route anyway) the dealership say's it is guaranteed 12mo. or 12,000 miles. Much better Warranty! This starter is garbage. I had it used for the $45.00 Core charge. Was not worth sending back!"
5,"Finally, more DN Angel!","I had been waiting a long time for this DVD to come out, and I was not disappointed. This disk sort of ""returns to the manga,"" as the story of the second hand of time resumes. Very enjoyable DVD as always; my only complaint was that the character designs were slightly different in the first episode (especially noticeable in With). However, the minor variations were not so heinous as to distract from the story. The second episode was especially funny, and I started to like Risa more (she's growing more mature as time passes). In this disk we also get a great deal of long-awaited background information that had so far been somewhat absent in the anime. Though there are now fewer loose ends, this does not prevent me from longing for the next volume (the third [and last] episode ended on such a cliffhanger that my roommate and I screamed expletives at the television set.)"
4,"Eh, Better Towards The End","I started this series not feeling that excited about it. In the middle I started to get into it much more and now that I'm just about to see the ending I find myself surprisingly apathetic towards it. While the series has been good so far and the characters are likable, I just don't feel that emotional involvement I need to be really excited about seeing how the series will end and have no idea if I'm going to be sad to see it end. If you've stuck with it this long you owe it to yourself to see how it ends but now that I've gotten this far in I can't imagine paying full price for this series. I still recommend it if you can find a copy but don't be surprised if you find yourself feeling apathetic as well."
4,A Fun Read,"Although it started out a bit slow, there was a great element of mystery that kept me reading on. The romance is developed slowly, they dont just hate each other one minute and love each other the next. The heroine is not wimpy or weepy, and the hero is very likeable. Matthews' writing comes pretty close to my favorites: Emma Jensen and Lynn Kerstan. A refreshing book with an interesting plot and plenty of unpredictable twists!"
2,Cheap Piece of C....,"Cheap Cheaper Cheapest.Skip this one there's much better.No documentation comes with it nor does the battery and it does not work without it.A simple, battery required on the box would have done it."
5,MutiTester,It worked great for the purpose of the science fair project of making batteries out of money. Excellent product for small task.
2,It came with something making noise inside,"And was working fine. But after 1 week it broke and did not work anymore. The quality was very cheap, of course so was the price. But I learned not to buy such products anymore."
1,el-cheepo,This is way to cheaply made I am disappointed (well not really typical chinese product ). My fault to buy it.The manual in the box is for a totally different item .... not surprised.I only needed this for very simple tests so tried keep the cost low (and I have a much higher end product somewhere in the moving boxes).For anything real DO NOT buy this ...OH YES require a 9V battery which is not mentioned and not included ....
3,Cheap basic multimeter,"Provides basic monitoring of VAC, VDC, current and resistance. Appears to be reasonably accurate. Construction quality is pretty poor, and to install the (non included) 9V battery requires unscrewing the back and is sort of fiddly to put back together.Really cheap basic multimeter that gets the job done."
4,Excellent writing,"From the start to the end, the writer made good use of all the dialogues, either to insert witty remarks or provide lengthy explanation within a few short carefully written sentences.The premise was with the French arms embargo after the Six Day War, the fledging state of Israel found itself in danger of unable to match her enemies weaponry.In came Daniel Klein, ace pilot who was invalidated due to war injury. Hatching a bold plan, he and his girlfriend sought to obtain the blueprints for the Mirage, the aircraft which the Israeli Air Force depend on. The only fly in the ointment was an arms dealer who was hoping to supply subsonic jets to the Israeli.The writer gave extensive background not only to the characters, but also to the development of the air defence of Israel, showing in a logical manner why the Mirage was priceless to Israel.The only kink in the entire story was the involvement of CIA agents at a critical point, without proper explanation for their presence or stance."
5,Timeless!,This is my second purchase of this CD. I love it. Judy's energy and love of God is contagious and the title song is dynamic. Keep it up Judy.
4,I love Judy Jacobs Music,"Judy Jacobs is an anointed woman of God, her music touches/reaches the soul of everyone who listens. I would love to attend one of Judy's concerts, if you are reading this Ms. Jacobs please send me tickets to your next performance (smile).Thank you Judy for all of your music."
1,"Its clear who judy jacobs god is, MONEY","Judy jacobs was clearly going for the christian conservatives rich coffers with this release. This album is blasphemy. She is selling this album just to make money , which has clearly become her god with making such a disgustingly unchristian release, which goes against the FIRST COMMANDMENT, she has raised a false idol, washington and franklin. I wish i could give this 0 stars, shame on Miz Jacobs for doing such an awful thing to our wonderful lord. No one should buy this album, it goes against our savior and lord, and anyone who likes this album should be ashamed and damned."
4,Great Singer - Not So Great Presentation,"I really really like Judy Jacobs and bought her album ""Almighty Reigns"" at the same time I got this one. Unfortunately, this one isn't as good, in my opinion. For one thing, being a ""live"" album there is a lot of background noise and you can't hear the main singer as well.Also I don't care for a few of the songs. My favorite is ""Days of Elijah"" which was not clear enough to me. I'm not saying the album isn't good but I play and enjoy ""Almighty Reigns"" much more."
4,lovely Moffo memento,"As far as opera movie goes this one is fairly good. Grantedthe acting is a bit static and the cinematography and stagingrather academic however the sets (real castle, real outdoor)and costumes are beautiful and everyone looks right for her/his part. Anna Moffo is definetely the star - she is ravishingto look at and a pleasure to listen to - a warm, full lyricsoprano voice with an easy top and considerable agility. LajosKozma is a dashing-looking Edgardo but is plagued by a rathertight nasal sound however he opens up as the opera goes alongand offers an eloquent final scene. Giulio Fioravanti and PaoloWashington are sturdy performers and have no problems meetingthe vocal demands of Enrico and Raimondo. The supporting castis adequate but no more. All in all an enjoyable movie andlovely memento of Anna Moffo in one of her great roles."
2,Moffo Momento,"I was really disappointed in the casting of this video. Moffo sings beautifully in dubbing but the balance of the cast is inferior to say the least. The costumes are pretty and the castle is grand but found myself totally unmoved. The Met version with Sutherland is better in my opinion, even though I'm a fan of Moffo. Must remember it's done in 1968 style as well, and not as much good acting as some today. Nice to have to remember Moffo, however."
4,Excellent Opera Movie,"I don't think I have seen a perfect Lucia. Ultimately my evaluation has to be based on the versions I have seen (MET version with Desay, 1967 mono version with Scotto). Of the three this one is my favorite. First this is the first version where I feel whisked back into Walter Scott's time. The on-location filming truly adds to this opera though the cinematography is somewhat amateurish and a little fuzzy and washed out. Doe-eyed Anna Moffo is breathtakingly beautiful and her singing first rate (and with only 6 days preparation I might add). The supporting cast are all fine....this Donizetti masterpiece comes to life in this version. The orchestration is not as prominent as newer versions and the sub-titles superb. I did not see a problem with the dubbing since I am always reading the sub-titles. The audio quality was acceptable given when it was shot. Any shortcomings in this production are more than made up by the talents of Anna Moffo."
2,"Good vocals, horrible production","First off, let's be clear that I'm writing here about the Lucia di Lammermoor DVD with Anna Moffo. I'm completely confused as to the reason for the reviews here of Joan Sutherland. This production of a great Donizetti opera is simply awful. The soundtrack seems to have been recorded from a staging and does not match well with the many outdoor scenes of the film. The acting is poor, a weakness shared by too many opera performers but one that can certainly be overcome in most operas. Arguably worst of all is the camera work, which has the quality of a backyard home movie. I will say that the vocals here are very good, thus the second star."
1,NOT Lucia,"I just opened my Moffo's version of Lucia and lo & behold inside the case was Moffo's La Traviata!I didn't send it back because it turned out to be a fine DVD, but after all, I was looking forward to Lucia."
5,"Hee Haw, 10th anniversary celebration","This is one of the best Hew Haw episodes being sold today. It's a two hour, 10th anniversary special featuring an array of stars who have appeared on Hee Haw before, in addition to the regulars. Johnny Cash, Merle Travis, Chet Atkins, Tammy Wynette--this lady alone is worth the price. Believe me, you'll absolutely love her. Charley Pride outdid himself. His song, ""Burgers and Fries,"" is one that will never get old. And nobody can sing it like Charley Pride. Please, do yourself a favor and buy this special edition of Hee Haw. It's worth 10 times the price. And thanks to Amazon for offering it."
3,A little misleading but a great DVD,"I purchased this DVD as a gift thinking it was the skits from the show. I guess I should have read a little more into it. The DVD is mainly song clips from the show and not the skits that I the gift recipient was hoping for. As I said though this was my fault because I just skimmed over the product and did not read into it. If you are one of those, like myself, who purchases based on what the package looks like, I would recommend looking into the details. Overall, for the price it is a great product and still really enjoyed watching the DVD."
4,VERY ENTERTAINING . . . A LITTLE PRICEY,"The previous reviewer gave this DVD only ONE star, but his complaint was that he ""never received this product."" How can you rate a program if you've never seen it?He went on to say, ""I have not ordered anything lately.""--Obviously his problem is with Amazon--not Hee Haw.If you enjoy Hee Haw, surely you will enjoy this DVD. However, it IS a bit pricey for a 96 minute show."
5,What Mass Effect should have been,"Anyone who has played this game will know that Mass effect was ripping from it. If only bioware had brainstormed more and plagiarized less......But enough about that dead series: Let`s talk star control! :DThis is perhaps the best Sci-fi game i`ve ever played!You get to explore galaxies! That`s right: GALAXIES!The space combat can be hard, so avoiding it is easier.This games age is painfully obvious, but if you like quality stories over flashy effects, and if you have a windows 95 lying around: GET. THIS. GAME.It`s worth it."
3,Whole Grain Groats,My wife really likes this stuff but to me its just ok. It has almost no flavor no matter how much you season it. It would probably go good in place of rice for some stuff but make sure you season it to death.
5,Future purchase a sure bet,I love the mouth feel of this product. I never had eaten buckwheat before buying this product. Somewhat chewy with a nice earthy taste. I recently added some to some homemade bean soup....turned out hearty and filling. Everyone should have a bag in the cupboard.
2,Tasteless,This buckwheat is tasteless compared to Russian buckwheat. Only good thing is that it is organic. Will not order again.
1,Stone in the Groats,"Perhaps a one-off never to be repeated, but my tooth found it causing a major dental bill. Bob's Red Mill never responded to my complaint."
4,Toasted Buckwheat Groats,"These organic buckwheat groats are easy to toast and cook. I enjoy them combined with cabbage, carrots and onions. They make wonderful salads, too, and at the price, they are a real bargain."
1,"Bits of gravel, or something, in the buckwheat.","With the first bowl I felt there was something gritty somewhere in a bite, but did swallow it. The next bowl I found a little ball of rock (?) about the size of a groat, very round and very, very hard. I am so thankful I did not bite down on it hard enough to crack a tooth. The flavor was very good, but I'm tossing it all out. Maybe I'm the only one to have this problem - but I won't be buying any more of this product."
2,Comes out mushy,"I like my buckwheat when after cooking each groat stays whole and they all are easy to separate. This one comes out as mush. Not to my liking.I love other products by this brand, but this one was really disappointing."
4,delicious but watch out for groat-sized rocks,"I love Bob's Red Mill organic whole grain Buckwheat Groats but this morning I found a small rock in my cooked buckwheat groats, it was tiny like a groat. This is worrisome as I could have cracked a tooth, so when you chew this, chew carefully. It was package number 3997800580. I've never had this happen before and I've ordered this through Amazon a few times."
5,Great HD enclosure,"This enclosure is very nice, it is quiet and cool, and very well constructed. Would definally buy this enclosure again."
5,Very good,Solid make; Particularly the firewire is fast. Worked well with my Mac.Shipping is fast. Willing to do business with them again.
4,Acomdata works great,"I love this thing -- it works every time. My computers, both running Windows XP Pro, find it every time I turn it on. I used it to house a hard drive I removed from another computer, so I would have easy access to my files without having to transfer them.However, I found it a little difficult to assemble after attaching the drive. There is a cable that runs the full length of the case and you have to make sure that the cable is in exactly the right place or the case won't close because of the cable sticking out.Jessie"
5,"Nicely made, and no fan to go bad","What can I say, it seems to be the best Hard disk enclosure I've ever purchased. I like the fact that there is no fan to go bad. This is the 6th different hard disk enclosure I've ever purchased. I like getting them with both Firewire and USB 2.0 because I prefer to use Firewire on my Macs, but not all of my stuff supports Firewire. So, having both is a plus."
1,"Works Sometimes, Lousy Technical Support","Was looking for a quiet, firewire HD enclosure. Acomdata's product looked like it fit the bill.Pros - solid case (quiet without a fan), easy to set up, had it up and running in minutes.Cons - would work for several days, then just stop. Initially, wouldn't work after reboots. Subsequently, it seemed more random. I wasn't able to find a good pattern.Acomdata's web site states that they give free tech support for as long as you own the product, and promise an email response in 3 days. Wasn't sure how they could manage such an inclusive policy, but I soon found out. Tech support is entirely an illusion. 4 emails (over about 3 weeks, to tech support and customer service) all went unanswered. Never received a solution to problem, and I'm now looking for a more reliable solution to external storage."
3,Disappointed,"I have three of these enclosures, and I needed a fourth, so I ordered another one. I was disappointed to find that they reduced the case size, and it now doesn't match my first three. Perhaps a minor point, but disappointing never the less.Function wise, it is easy to install a bare hard drive, and it works well."
5,Highland Hopes,I have enjoyed every novel I've read that Gary Parker has written. This was no exception. Great story line. Each character truly had his/her own personality and it was easy to feel like you were inside Abby's head sometimes. I highly recommend it.
1,Are you kidding me?,"Hated these books, recommended by a relative, so I read them. Awkward style, excessive religousity, and unbelievable behavior on the part of the characters. Nobody acts like this. I wanted to slap Abby."
2,Short-lived,"This is the most intoxicating, fresh, and clean smell ever, BUT it doesn't even last an hour. I can't even smell the fragrance by the time I get to work. I use the eau de toilette. When I sampled the Perfume spray, it lasted much longer, but I can't see spending $85 for a bottle of perfume. For $45, the cologne spray should last as long the cheapies, don't ya think. It breaks my heart because I do LOVE this fragrance."
2,Smells great but doesn't last,"Sorry to say the fragrance doesn't last more than an hour. Also, purchased the product for fresh soap or shower smell but instead it has a heavy citrus fragrance."
5,It changed my point of view..,"This book is really a masterpiece. It changed the way I think about history, making me see that those who win in war make history up. A lot of lies have been told about what we know as II WW, and the real intentions of those who fought in it. I do recommend this book to anyone who whould like to know something more than what propaganda has told us, it's a shame that it's not on print anymore. I hope someone can do something about that...."
1,seloc stern drives 1992-2000 marine manual,"Pretty much a complete waste of money. Way too generic. I learned the hard way. Just get the manufacturers manual. Seriously, I found way better information on the internet boating blogs, photos, how to's, etc. I should have sent it back to Amazon but I got my greasy prints on the pages and I am too lazy."
4,Review of Civil War book,"Love history and love reading about the civil war. You can't really get into the war without reading about the 69 th N.Y. Also am intriqued by Gen. Meagher [Marr}. Incredible that such a brave man could end up in such a inglorious way. Bet he got drunk and fell overboard. Alcohol ruined so many Irishman. Relative to the book, I thought too much time was given to the soldier's musket's and photographs. A good job was done on the battles, however. I always believed that to get these soldiers on these killing fields; they must have been inebriated. This book ,to its credit, confirms this."
3,Not a bad toy if the price is right.,I got this r/c skater toy for a good price (under $20). good value. Kids held interest for about a month. Not they take it out every few months. It's worth hanging on to.
1,dont know cant get a battery,my son got one of these for x-mas from his aunt and after xmas I went back to where she bought it and there was no batteries avalable any person I spoke to stated it was a seasonal item yet there was still 6 of these tony things and 3 other remotes that take this flex packso I ventured to all the other local toy stores and same problem no flex pack so now I have a 70.00 dollar toy that my son can not play withhis aunt missed placed the receipt so if I take it back they will give me the sale price of 29.99 so his aunt might as well have just walked into target and given the cashier 30.00 dollarsand left
1,Special Battery not included,This toy really stinks if you are not familiar with it. Not sure if it is Amazon's fault or the toy maker fault. It requires a specialized battery sold seperately and there is no mention of it on Amazaon's web site. My son got this for Christmas and was all excited until he found out he couldn't play with it until we found the specialized battery.
1,Not too impressive.....,"My son wanted this for Christmas and at the time there was only one review, which was favorable, so I ordered it. I am really disappointed in it and my son is too. It keeps falling over, and sure, it gets up on its own, but how fun is that when it continuously falls? It is hard to even keep it going in a straight line without tipping. All in all, a disappointment. The only fun is watching our dog bark at it. Too spendy for this toy. I would NOT recommend it. My son, who is nine, in his words says that it is ""frustrating"" and ""disappointing"". Save your money and buy something worth while!!!!!"
2,What the heck,"If I go out and buy a new car I hope it comes with a battery.If I get a hamburger is there not meat included in the deal.I thought i was getting a great deal(didnt read the fine).but now I have to hunt down a flexpack.I`m heading out to get a snowcone now,i hpe it comes with some flavoring and not just ice.and by the way not every hobby shop has this battery pack"
4,Tony Hawk Skateboard,"I was very disappointed with the Tony Hawk Skateboard. My son's grandmother bought it for him for Christmas last year. We had to spend an extra [X] for a battery pack, before he could even play with it. Finally when we got the battery pack and was able to play with it, the first time it crashed, the front wheel broke off. Also, when we went to put the battery in the skateboard part of the toy, the battery cover broke,so we had to tape it. I was fed up with the toy, and we just took a loss on our money. A very expensive one!"
1,beware of tony hawk!,"Before purchasing Tony Hawk Skateboard ..., be aware that it requires a ...battery pak to operate it. OF COURSE the battery pak is not included with the purchase. This is obviously a marketing strategy to make it appear that you're not paying [more money] for a TOY. The other frustrating thing about this is that I (my son) have had his Tony Hawk since late November and I have not been unable to find a battery pak to buy. [The store], where I made the purchase NEVER has the battery in stock. Your only alternative is to buy it online ...and pay ... additional [money] for shipping"
1,NOT AS COOL AS IT LOOKS ON TV!!!,"They really made this one look a lot better on the TV commercial. I was expecting skateboard style stunts but this thing runs more like a slow car. I did like how it stands up automatically if it falls but sadly, that is the only cool feature of this toy. I returnde it and got R/C Battlebots instead."
2,Batteries not included!!,"When they say batteries not included, what they really mean is your child will be super disappointed when they open this RC toy up and can't use it since it requires a special rechargeable battery (sold seperately). Why they would sell this item without the battery is beyond comprehension. Two thumbs down Tyco!!"
3,Incomplete version on DVD,"Let me start by stating that I understand this concert was shot a long time ago, so the quality of the video and sound is just OK. I'm not as unhappy as other reviewers, but what really caught my attention was the fact that they simply cut off the portion where she introduces each and every member of this amazing band behind her. I have the LASERDISC edition of this concert and it has 5 minutes more than the DVD. As if there was not enough space on the DVD! This missing introduction of all the musicians is very respectful, with close ups of everyone, and some reactions are really nice to watch. This is the reason why I rate this item with only three stars. If you like Diana Ross, buy it anyway. But I'm going to keep my Laserdisc, just in case."
5,Superb. This lady knows how to sing the Jazz and Blues!,"Diana Ross is great in this Video and so is the band. She creates this great atmosphere when she sings live. Highlights are: My Man, Lover man, where can you be... & More. All the bluesy and jazzy songs here are very melo and sexy. She is an amazing presence and a great talent, what else can I say..."
5,STOLEN MOMENTS,"THE ONE AND ONLY...THERE HAS NOT, AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER!!!THE ORIGINAL , "" D "" FOR THE TRUE DIVA. THE VOICE, THE FACE , THE STYLE ,AND THE GRACE. HER CHARM, THAT SMILE AND CLASS .YOU WILL ENJOY AND CHERISH THESE STOLEN MOMENTS. AND YOU WILL WANT TO SHARE THEM WITH YOUR DEAREST FRIENDS. THE LADY.....SINGS AND GIVES OF HERSELF. SIT BACK AND RELAX AND ENJOY YOUR STOLEN MOMENTS WITH THE BOSS!!!!"
5,diana ross at here LIVE finest!!!!,i have never been more impressed with diana ross... this live performance is nothing less than flawless.. the band and miss ross mend beautifully.. i cant get enough of it...
2,THIS LADY CAN'T SING THE BLUES-SORRY,BACKED UP BY SOME OF THE BEST MUSICANS LIVING MS. ROSS JUST DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO SING BLUES OR JAZZ/ SHE DOESENT HAVE THE RANGE OR THE VOICE OR THE ELECTRICITY / A FOR EFFORT /Z FOR RESULT / 2 STARS FOR THE MUSIC ONLY / A DISAPOINTMENT
1,Piece Of Crap,I hate this thing. actually it only worked once. i got a few songs on it. now it is incapable of reading anything and i intend on replacing it in the near future. avoid at all costs. id recomend mp3 cd or high mp3 player such as the ones made by Rio and the apple ipod for you mac owners
4,DreamQuest,DreamQuest will fascinate children new to the fantasy genre. Its style is easy to follow for anyone not yet in high school and its wit will grab a chuckle or an amused smile even from older readers. Pottle treats his characters with the kind of mirth and mayhem that makes his writing comic as well as dark.The only caveat is that the large amount of characters and different viewpoints can grow confusing at times.
4,Kept me on the edge of my seat,"If you like Tolkein, Barron, Brooks or McCaffery, then you'll enjoyDreamQuest. It has adventure, magic, friendship, romance and tragedy.Itkept me on the edge of my seat. I can't wait for the next book,DreamQuest2: ProphecyQuest. I give this book four stars.Prairie Middle School 8th Grader"
5,A captivating adventure,"I was captivated when reading Dream Quest and found it difficult to put down until I was finished with it. This inspirational adventure of a young man going through exciting trials in a fantastic world captured me until the end and beyond. This story appealed to the brazen, adventurous side within me with the creative lands, creatures, characters and adventures that Bill Pottle has woven together in Dream Quest."
5,WOW!!!,DreamQuest is Off the hizzle fo' shizzle!!!!! It is the perfect book for everyone and Bill Pottle is a fantasic author i can't wait for prophecyquest to come out!!!
4,A heroic adventure,"Dreanquest is a fine epic full of colorful characters, drama suspense and action. The fate of the world hinge on the courage of two young men after a mysterious dream sets them on their destined paths. Will they succumb to the evil that wishes to control the forgotten powers of centuries past, and enslave the magical races of Daranor? Or will Tarther and Derlin rise above unconquerable odds and unite the Kingdoms in a final attempt to rid the world of evil?A fluid and witty style set Tarthur and Derlin up on an enchanted ride to greatness. Though they hardly lack in confidence they will need all the support they can get. Elves, merfolk, wizards and the Creator himself have recognized the importance of their quest and make the ultimate sacrifice to insure that Daranor doesn't fall into the shadows.A must read! Dreamquest has everything a fantasy lover needs!"
5,Perfect.,"I'm not really a ""toriphile,"" but I loved this. Winter and Crucify are good, but Tori's covers of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""Angie"" are amazing. She gives those songs such a mournful, beautiful sound."
5,Tori Covers Legends,"Forget the title cut -- it's the covers here that merit special attention. All three are improvements, though drastic re-interpretations, on the originals. Unfortunately, none of these made it onto any full-length album of hers, and so many are unaware of these songs. For those who prefer to hear just Tori and her piano, these last three songs are worth much, much more than the $10 you'll pay for them. Tori .... is simply the greatest singer-songwriter in the music business today."
5,really good!,"i'm not a diehard tori amos fan, but i have to say this album is great. her voice has a way of making any song sound like a haunting, beautiful masterpiece. it's so poignant that she even has the ability to bring tears to your eyes (just listen to her ""smells like teen spirit""; i almost cried). buy this, you wont regret it!"
5,music for the listerners...,"...This Ep goes straight to my heart. All the songs are so full of soul and emition that I almost believe that I am on a rasperry cake cloud. ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" is eaven better with Tori then with Nirvana, although they too are super. But Tori is Tori. And she is the best of them all.Tack för mig."
4,The best effort from Amos,"I have to admit that this EP spoiled me for anything else which Amos has done. I find the bulk of her other material to be repetitive, to say the least. If you are going to pick up one Tori Amos CD, this is the one. The version of Crucify here is supior to the CD mix, and Smells Like Teen Spirit is beyond amazing."
4,"A Throwaway, but still fun...","I don't have time for EPs these days, but when I saw it was 2/3 covers, I figured why not. If it turned out to be [junk], there were any number of die-hards I could palm it onto.Thankfully, I was wrong; her version of ""Smells Like Teen Sprit"" is good for a laugh, and ""Angie"" is so straight as to be reverential, but her version of Zep's ""Thank You"" is one of the best I've ever heard.It's also worth it for the A-side ""Crucify"", although most of you will already know that from owning the album it comes from. The remix is negligible, but I give Tori credit for making an otherwise useless EP into something a bit more interesting."
2,save your cash,"The three covers are tepid and dull. The two originals are excellent (IMHO, ""Winter"" is one of her best songs), but they're available on the full-length *Little Earthquakes*. Pick that up instead. I bought *Crucify* at a swap meet for a dollar, and I'm not sure it was worth it."
2,Mediocre,"This EP could have been better. I didn't like Tori's cover of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". If you are a Tori Amos fan and would like to hear covers of songs by male artists, then buy ""Strange Little Girls"". I do love the song ""Crucify"", though."
4,"Tori, Tori, Tori...","The music is great, but I can only give it 4 stars, because ""Crucify"" is a horrible, evil song, proving Tori's misconceptions and lack of knowledge of Christianity."
1,boring,"i hate when people say that they like someones cover of a song better then the orriginal song, and that there better. they cant be better, the person who wrote it is obvoiusly better at it. Nirvanas smells like teen spirit has angst, passion, and is haunting. sorry people but tory amos didnt get any of this. she got popular from doing a nirvana song, how stupid is that? do your own songs unless your doing a different one for fun."
4,A Small Treat For Tori Listeners,"This EP has two songs on it from ""Little Earthquakes"", two classic rock tunes and the Nirvana ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", which is absolutely haunting. The acoustic version of the three non-LP tracks are fascinating! She needs to put out more like this!"
5,Mostly for the teen spirit...,"I liked this CD, but mostly for Tori's version of ""Teen Spirit"". Hey, now I finally understand most of the words to the song!"
1,"can you say, cruelty?","this is a travesty. this book actually tells you how to dehumanize your child and make them into the perfect robot. the book speaks of putting your child into ""level"" (state of meditation) and programming everything from their goals to their dreams. individuality is good - soul stealing from an innocent child is not."
3,too bad,"I really liked this phone a lot. Although It will not connect to the browser i need for my cell service, and it doesn't have the usual easy to use button (quick keys) for voice mail and text messages...i wish i could keep it, but i can not figure out how to set it to work my downloading services. If anyone can help i would really appreciate it. I would love to keep this phone."
2,Poor Quality,I bought this carrier to take my 9 lb cat onboard an aircraft during a move. The carrier fits well under airline seats but the top zipper broke the third time it was opened. The zipper broke in such a way that it was unfixable so I had to pin the top to contain my cat for the rest of the layover and last flight.
4,Of historical significance,"Henry Brackenridge traveled up the Missouri River with Manuel Lisa in 1811, and this is his account of that voyage. After reading several books about the fur trade era and seeing this journal cited as a reference in many of them, I was somewhat disappointed after reading it. Other than giving detailed descriptions of the countryside along the Missouri River from St. Louis to the Mandan villages of North Dakota, and observations of the Indian culture and customs, the book (only 70 pages) seems to come up short. I gave it four stars because it does contain some interesting and authoritative reports of the times, depicts life along the Missouri in 1811 and gives insight into the rivalry between the two competing fur companies of Manuel Lisa and Wilson Price Hunt. It is of historical significance and should be read by enthusiasts of this time period (just don't expect edge of your seat reading)."
5,let another classic by wheless,"A judge/lawyer doth not a bible scholar make..... However a judge/lawyer who can speak eight languages, including hebrew, greek and latin doth make a bible scholar. I Have noticed something about all the negative reviews of this book, they all attack the author, not his argument. Oh by the way, please do us a favor and dont cut and paste Turkel's criticisms of Wheless, that man has a slight honesty problem(among many others, bad logic being another huge problem), if you wish to explore that honesty problem please go to infidels.org."
1,this book is awful,"this book is pathetic. if you want a great book on babycare, look no further than the baby book by william and martha sears. then you won't be wasting your money."
5,Wonderful!,"This is a wonderful, fun and very educational game. There are lots of categories, including phrases, countries, and colors. very effective. I would definately advise you to buy this.Arianne"
5,Impressive DVM,"This Digital Multimeter not only came well-packaged, but it also had the battery installed! So it was ready to go out of the box. The leads are protected at both ends - I'll probably wind up keeping the little tip covers in a baggie, to keep from losing them - and the whole device seems well-thought out."
2,LCD failed,"A nice unit that I enjoyed using, but after a few months several segments of the LCD failed. I can sort of make out the proper digits so, while it is frustrating, it has not rendered the unit unusable. Had I reviewed this unit before it failed, I would have given it 4 stars. Two stars is the best I can do for a faulty display."
2,Professional (?) ... defective out-of-box,"Unit was defective out-of-the-box. Middle digit of display was missing bottom half. Quickly got tired of guessing so requested replacement. One (+) week lost in wait ... not to mention having to buy a cheap substitute to replace a ""professional"" product."
5,Excelente,"El tester es muy bueno, viene con una funda protectora, mide la temperatuta, mperaje , voltios, lo recomiendo"
5,Perfect family time!!!,"I liked this season too. If I compare this Season with the Season 1-2-3, I laughed or cried less :) May be little bit less action than the earlier seasons but still good. If you are planning to buy you should go head. You will meet with new Felicity."
5,Fabulous,"Did not watch this edition yet. But the 3 other Wide Screen editions 1 to 3 were fabulous! Better than the previous releases of the Full Screen editions were some episodes, filmed inside, were rather dark in its color and not quite as sharp. These pseudo HD-versions now are much better."
2,Defective set,I have been sent two sets of Road to Avonlea season 4. You sent me a replacement after I reported that dics 3 & 4 contained the same episodes. However the replacement set had the same problem. I sent back the first set you sent me and have kept for now the second one in hopes that the problem can be remedied and you will be able to send the intact set at which time I will return the second defective set.
2,Picture quality dark.,"We love the Avonlea series and were willing to pay for a good quality DVD.Season 3 and 4 are both dark in all scenes that are not outside. Plus, there are 2 identical discs in Season 4 so we are missing one entire disc that has 4 episodes on it. It makes me wonder if these aren't a poorly duplicated product made cheaply and quickly for pure profit."
4,A 'Wow' Movie,"I read the reviews, I read the case, I thought I knew what I was getting in to. Wrong. This film is intense, and it is far more insightful then I expected. It examines the whole idea of love, fraternal, romantic, and the limits we meet. It also takes some of those erotic fantasies that get put in front of us on a regular basis and shows that they come with a very dark side and huge cost.I have passed my copy among a number of friends. They have differing takes on the film, but none have regretted watching it."
2,Sub Par,This movie is kinda slow taking off and in my opnion was slow threw out if I had the choice I would have probely rented insted
3,A lot of chatter!,"I have to agree with Patrick, who did another review of this film. There is a lot of talking in this film and it tends to come across as a little preachy at times. These two ""brothers"" spend a lot of time letting people down and being let down and and letting each other down and letting themselves down and you just want to hit fast forward and get on with it!You'd only rush yourself into a disappointing ending that leaves one wondering -- what the heck was that about? Overall the film is shot pretty well and the boys are, mostly, good looking. There are no gratuitous sex scenes -- just gratuitous sex talk.I wouldn't say not to watch this -- but I'd say I was happy I rented this and didn't purchase it!"
3,They've done it again!!! Alas...,"Once more this group has published a marvellous showcase for Beverly Sills. As usual she bewitches with her commensurate artistry, her technical skill, her warmth and her ability to impart magic on the drama and humour required of this role.Be warned, however:1. It is sung in English. This removes the distraction of subtitles though it was strange at first hearing it performed in English!2. The sound is poor. It allows the words to come through clearly enough (most times) but somewhere in the chain it was recorded at too low a level. Turn the volume right up and the underlying noise becomes apparent, obtrusive in quieter orchestral or recitative passages.As a production it is competent and imaginative if a little lacklustre at times - one has to doubt that it would have made the international stage. Given its vintage, however, (1974) it is a document worthy of any operatic collection and certainly Ms Sills' fans will snap it up."
2,Very unprofessional as well as slapstick,I found this dvd below Miss Sills. It is very slapstick with slapping each other on thr backside. It was filmed in Washington D C and may be catering to that type of audience. Certainly this opera with Joan Sutherland is far superior.
1,Donizetti - The Daughter of the Regiment,"We didn't like this Opera because there is no subtitle, they sing in English, even though my husband was professor in College and he is American born ,also graduated from Pepperdine and USC University; he isn't understand either. I was born in Thailand, my native language is Thai so I really didn't understand indeed and I felt sleep all the way from the beginning.We are really upset for this DVD."
4,For Chess Lovers,"A short, but nonetheless amusing collection of stories for the chess enthusiast. If you are tired of all the dry technical manuals on openings, tactics, strategy, etc, then pick this one up. It won't improve your game in the least, but it will make you laugh."
3,Expandable Kit - closetmaid,"I expected this ""kit"" to contain all of the items needed to hang it. However, it only contained the uprights and no horizontal bar to attach them to. My bad for not reading the description? No, this description did not identify every item in the kit. My bad for assuming it was complete."
3,"Not a ""kit""! No hardware or brackets","This was perfect for the small back wall of our closet, but be aware that although it says it's a ""kit"", it's not. It comes with shleves and rods, but the tracks to mount them on are not included and neither are any screws or wall anchors. You have to buy all that stuff separately."
2,Don't expect to hang this without spending additional money,"As someone previously mentioned, this is not a kit. It does not include the necessary brackets to hang into walls. You cannot hang this item with out the brackets....... Buy brackets if you expect to hang this item."
1,mislead,"Just like the prior review, I saw the picture and thought this was a 4 ft closet system. However, It does not include the hanger nor uprights. Its just two shelves and a rod. Worthless to me!"
4,One of a series of books for a gift,"My book was delivered, and the seller was kind enough to inform me of shipment, let me know the status of the shipment. The book was finally received. I think the time lapse from order to shipment was very long."
4,I'm a huge fan of Shan!,Cirque Du Freak #7 does have a little too much fighting for me but then again it IS a vampire series. I love Darren Shan (author AND character) and every book in this series never falls short of my expectations. I can't wait to read the last five. XD
3,Book 7 Darren Shan,"For readers who get involved with this series, it's fun to read all twelve in the series. This completed my set."
5,worth anybodys time,"like the title said, its worth any bodys time. this author has kept me on the edge of my seat since the first book. its great for anyone. pick it up and you won't be able to put it down."
4,Blood never tasted so good,"""Hunters of The Dusk"" is the seventh novel in the best selling Cirque Du Freak series. Vampire Prince and still just a teenage boy, Darren and Mr.Crepsley are chosen by the frightful Mr. Tiny or so called Mr. Destiny, to trek on a life or death or mission to find and slay the Vampeneze lord before he gets his full powers. They meet strange denizens on the way who fight by there side or watch laugh. Author Darren Shan's vivid detail and original voice will keep you glued to your seats in horror, excitement, and disgustment.Darren Shan's Cirque Du Freak first caught my eye when I heard they were about vampires and ""hunters"". I like how Darren's writing can post a perfect picture in your mind about what's happening and what's about to happen. Darren's writing has no flaws and his storyline has no flaws as well. ""Hunter of the Dusk"" is a great novel and Darren Shan is a great author"
5,The Battle Continues,"This book is the 7th book in the saga. This book is about a vampire boy, Darren Shan. Darren has just become the vampire prince, the highest of all vampiers. The War of Scars is going on and Darren is helping an older prince with the war. Mr Tiny, a powerful person who created the vampiers, came to the mountian. He said that three vampiers would hunt for the vampaneze lord but humans and creaters can help. Mr Thiny said they will cross paths with the lord four times. The three people are Darren, Mr Crepsley, and Vancha, another prince. They head out for a witch's house, named Evanna. Once they're there, they travel to the Cirque Du Freak. One night, Darren follows Evanna to a band of vampaneze. Darren goes back to get Mr Crepsley and Vanca. They rush there and start to fight with the vamaneze. You will have to read this book to find out what happens. It is a really good book."
3,Not up to the standard of the saga,This book was by far the worse one of the series so far... Lack of everything except for boring transitional dialogue was present. The last two chapters are the only reason i gave this book a 3 stars instead of 2 stars. Very disappointed and would not recommend this book to anyone if it was by itself but since it is part of a series i would tell who ever reads it to just read through it if possible by every other chapter or so or just read the first 3 chapters and the last 3 chapters and that would do just as could as reading the whole thing.
4,Transplanted,"Where I live, we don't have record stores... pretty much all our goods comes from walmart. We don't even have broadband internet so downloading music is not possible. Amazon helped me get my music fix by offering this album at a low price and fast shipping. The album is great though it takes getting used to. I really like how Tim is able to experiment with his musical style in these albums, however I would say not all the songs are to my liking (but then again, I can't think of any album I liked all the songs)."
3,Expensive piece of junk,This thing lasted 15 minutes before the plastic front axle broke completely off the board. What a piece of (...junk)!!! Not to mention the additional (...money) for the battery pack above and beyond the skateboard. Complete ripoff!!
4,Remote Control Battery Compartment Broke,"This toy was fun the first 5-10 minutes of using it until my son became so frustrated he was in tears. It responded intermittently and eventually not at all. Discovered that the 9 volt battery kept popping out of the remote, and eventally the cover broke. Exchanged it and the new one had the same problems! It's a very poor design. The battery barely fits the compartment and is located under your palm when controlling the vehicle so eventually pops open. Didn't get to use the toy long enough to break the axles..."
1,not such a great deal.,I purchased this item for $9.99 which i taught was a great deal. after receiving it. I relized the batterypack and charger were not included in the box. you have to purchase it separately for around $34.00 plus shipping.
1,not a good toy,"tony hawk skateboard is not a good toy; It doesn't have it's own battery pack so you have to buy one separately. you end up spending almost $100.-- just to get it working. It fell apart in 2 places the first half hour of using it. if anyone has an unopened package, send it back or take it back. an unworthy toy!"
3,Radio Control Tony Hawk,"My 10 year old son received this gift for X-mas from his grandparents. He used it for 5 minutes outside and came in crying because the front axle broke. We took it to the store and exchanged it for a new one. The new one had a hair line crack in the front axle when we took it out of the box, and it broke right away when he used it. I think there is some design flaw and it should be removed from the shelves until Tyco comes up with a better design. It is very flimsy. I also think it is frustrating that you have to buy the special battery pack separately just to play with it. I think it should be included in the package with the toy."
4,Cool Beans,Ok overall I found that this was a great DvD. because I love Sum41 and they are so funny and cute. But i didn't understand why some things were edited when it was a DvD I thought nothing could be edited because I like unedited things! LoL. Also guys there are a lot of lesbians making out be sure to buy it lol ...! hhaa typical male documentary lol. Well anyways I laughed my [rear end] off at the home videos and there are all their videos and concerts to it's overall a kick [butt] Dvd and it's totally worth the cash so buy one!
5,This is the Best DVD ever!,"If your looking for a DVD that mixes comedy,hott guys,and awesome music, this is the DVD for you! Sum 41 is my favorite band of all time, and for my 14th birthday my brother purchased this DVD for me.When I first watched it, I couldn't stop laughing. This DVD has so many crazy shenanigans that Sum 41 does, it kept me laughing even when I wasn't watching it! This DVD is jam-packed with 4 hott guys, 4 hysterical personalities, and I just can't get enough!!!! If anyone from Sum 41 reads this, keep up the good,excellent,amazing,awesome,great work!!"
5,VERY FUNNY!!,Any fan of Sum 41 absolutely needs to get this DVD. You get to see hilarious home movies made by the guys as well as one whole live concert. This dvd is over two hours of entertainment that is certainly worth the money.
4,The younger brother of Joseph,"My husband and I bought this CD while travelling in Prague in 1998. I never had heard anything composed by Michael Haydn before, and this disc was a complete surprise to me. Beautiful music, excellent orchestra and choir, excellent balance between them, full and rounded sound. And I only could listen to this CD twice! A friend of ours borrowed it, and it was stolen from his car (!) (lucky thief!)"
3,No traction on wet indoor enviroments,"Shoe is very comfortable. There are no questions about that. However, this shoe was designed for outside use. It has way to aggressive of a tread for indoor use. I work in a food manufacturing factory and have slid many times on the production floor and in office areas (where my boots are still wet) that have the standard white tiles.I would rate these higher but a sole that says slip resistant and that is very slippery is not a good thing."
3,"Fun, but fun ends quickly when it breaks","We got two of these for my son for his 5th birthday, he and his 3 year old brother (and father and uncles) loved it. The next time we went to use them, they were broken. They were so loved, I returned them, and got new ones. One remote didn't work out of the package, again, after one use, one of the ships broke. Foolishly, I brought one of them back again, and asked the girl at the toy store about it, she told me that she got them back all the time and said, confidentially, don't buy another, you'll be back here returning it. Guess, what, I got another, and am bringing them back again. They are tons of fun, but only buy styrofoam toys if you live near the toy store with a good return policy. Save your money for something else."
4,Fun but dangerous,"My kids love this toy but.... the battery needs recharging often, it is a thick foam saucer and it is dangerous. The plastic blades are not blocked by anything and CUT skin!"
2,Mazda REPU Clutch Kit,First clutch kit was completely wrong application. Returned it. I talked directly to supplier and ordered another clutch kit. I again talked to supplier because the second clutch cover needed to be machined to work. The clutch disc couldn't be modified so it couldn't be used so I used a disc I had.Now the clutch works. The supplier was very helpful and knowledgeable. The problem is the clutch set just was not the right one for my application. I would use the supplier again.
2,Not so great...,The whole thing is made pretty cheaply and it broke on me after a few hours of use. it really didn't help that much with dust control either. I would not recomend this to a friend.
2,No use don't buy it,"My 2yr old daughter sucks her 2 middle fingers, I read the review and ordered it thru amazon. I applied it on her finger nails and she tried sucking it and did not like the taste, after 2-3 attempts she got used to it and started sucking her fingers again. I paid $14 for no use. Try some thing else for kids, it migth be useful for adults."
4,Canon VB-C50i camera has great optics,"My office is high up in a building facing south where I have great views of a mall, hotels, a marina with hundreds of yachts, an island off the coast, and beautiful sunsets behind all of that -- in other words many objects to enjoy looking at. I installed the Canon security camera on my desktop computer and use it to pan and zoom around -- watching boats, people and the weather -- all for fun. The 22x optical zoom and low light capabilities allowed me to capture a still frame of a cresecent moon with crators visible. Late in the day, images are sillouhetted against the setting sun. There is a button on the controler which allows you to adjust for that, illuminating the immage in the shadow to see details. I am only beginning to understand all of the functionality built into this great product."
3,An excellent addition for Nazareth Collectors,"Looking at the set list of this CD - you should be giving this double album 5 stars. Especially the second CD covers tracks from the (up until now) not documented period of the 2XS and Sound Elixier tours. However, the overall sound quality of these live tracks is not all that great. As mentioned in the booklet, these are 'sound board' recordings and obviously, there has not been any mastering. It is great to hear all these live recordings, but if you are not a Nazareth collector, buy 'Snaz (their live double album from the 'Fool Circle' tour) instead."
3,Helpful little book,"Although this book barely qualifies as a dictionary, its collection of common phrases is very helpful. Its primary shortcoming is that it does not give pronunciation next to the phrase -- you have to figure that out from the pronunciation guide in the front of the book. I recommending having a full-fledged English-Slovak-English dictionary in addition to this book."
4,some corrections,"This is not aimed as a review. Being Slovak I want to correct some bugs I found on sample pages. These can be viewed as a minor bugs (book is very basic intro to Slovak language) but especially if you learn wrong pronunciation it can make problems to understand you. On the page of Slovak alphabet these examples suits better according to my opinion:* bag instead of beg,* loch or lochness instead of hurrah,* swore (past tense of swear) instead of old, pronunciation is difficult, something like w. Actually it is diphthong (combination of two vowels) of u and o in Slovak."
3,"it is a good pocket book for travel,not a good study book","if you are just going to learn a few things to say...this is the right bookif you are just going to travel there or meet someone from slovakia it is a good book....but it is not a study book.it has limited help in it.it does not have the most accurate key for pronouncing the letters.and it does not explain its grammar very well..only a couple pages.the dictionary is very short and limited.if you need a dictionary instead of a phrase book,this is not for you.on the good side,this is a great book if you are traveling because it can easily fit in your pocket.this book also has many many pages of useful phrases for many situations."
4,Slovak phrase book,"Useful Slovak dictionary/phrase book. Could never publish all words to cross reference, but does a fairly good job of the important words. Recommend."
1,"Bad movie, bad DVD","What a mess. The story, which deals with snuff films in Poland is treated as an action/comedy(!), it's impossible to follow and it's shot with the shakiest nausea-inducing hand held camera since Blair Witch. The editing mimics that of a bad rock video, and the result is an indecipherable bomb. On top of that, the DVD mastering is faulty, the picture plays back ""squeezed"" as if it had anamorphic processing, but it cannot be unsqueezed with any of the available settings in a DVD player. Hard to believe that nobody noticed this before the disc came out. Movie quality aside, this release is defective and should be recalled."
1,Not just the laziest shopper,"While I enjoyed Ms. Gallagher's first book and a few of her articles in magazines it appears she was not at her best here. If I want advise on how to shop on the internet or at discount house's she gives a lot of names but not much on the substaince of purchasing. This book should include the statement ""the self proclaimed laziest research write"", not the laziest shopper."
2,"bargins are great, puns are tiring",This book has some wonderful tips for shopping. Stephanie has great ideas and presents the facts well. It is very boring reading through all of her little stories to get to the information I am looking for in this book. I wish there was a way to get her information and not have to read her whinning and telling us how awful thing are in her life.
2,Poor Quality,"These pads work okay, but when un-boxed, all of the 10 had clumped glue in the area where they are glued together. It meant I had to use a junk piece to sand down the extra glue before I could start using on my project. The overall quality could definitely be better and I'd think twice before purchasing."
3,Alternative product,Works great if you combine with extra liquid spot remover that comes with the kit. I did not use the dry kit on other carpet except hemp rugs. It takes a long time until the dry kit dries out complete. Best is over the weekend if you want it to work. Cleaned area looks refreshed and I was happy with the money I spend on the product compare to other aggressive spot removers.
5,I use this professionally,I use this product professionally in my carpet cleaning business. If you want exact instructions on how to use this please visit my website at [...] and I have all the steps. Thanks-I hope this helps!
5,Host is the MOST!,The best carpet cleaner around......in my opinion. It's nice because you can immediately walk on the carpet following the application. I would def. recommend it to anyone. I checked around and found it is the cheapest on-line to spite the shipping cost. It arrived in the time specified. Next time I will purchase a larger box.
3,EXPECTED BETTER,"USED THE PRODUCT, AS DIRECTED,ON RUG TRAFFIC PATTERN. WAS ONLY MILDLY EFFECTIVE AFTER USING IS TWICE IN THE SAME AREA. RUG WAS NOT REALY THAT DIRTY, SO I'D SAY THAT THE PRODUCT HAS NOT FULLFILLED ITS PROMISES."
2,"Cleans great, but what a mess!","I think this cleans as good as any product, and the price is right, so I gave it a ""hoot"". Well, I did a 3x4 area and it looks so much better, but I will NEVER be able to get the residue out of the rug. Already cleaned the filter twice on the vacumm, and it's going to need a good wash, and still residue leaving dust on the non-carpeted surfaces. Just hope it doesn't hurt my cats when they get it in their paws and start licking! I'll never do this again, rather pay the $100 for a professional cleaning and have it done and over with. I'll be paying for this mistake for weeks."
5,Greatest yet,"I used Host when we had a bad water leak on our brand new light gray carpet. The water stain was light brown and it had a smell. I used the spot remover first, then used the powder. I brushed the powder in, then left it for about 5 hours then vaccumed it up. I still saw the stain a little so I repeated the process, this time I left it overnight and it came right up. This is a great product and I will always use it."
2,No ink!,"These arrived with the ink dried up in all three pens. Must be a super old product in the seller's inventory. Cute design and nice size, but have to send them back."
3,Come On! It's Bruce Lee!,This is a fine collection of Bruce Lee classics!It's not the best thing since sliced bread...but it's close.
3,CBS/FOX could have done better,"I was really disappointed with this because I couldn't wait to pick up my set. It was basically a retread of the old laserdisc versions released 6 years ago, but without the original trailers that came with the LD. I ended up selling my DVD set and getting the MEDIA ASIA versions. Better picture but with subtitles only. I wish this could have been the definitive collection, but in the end CBS/FOX just got greedy. I wish they took the time and care Warner did with Enter the Dragon."
1,5 Stars for Bruce Lee 0 for this DVD set!!,"I have to strongly agree with the previous review...and in fact because these are sooo scratch filled, poorly dubbed , missing footage junk...I investigated and found that in the UK they have a great set with original language and subtitles , made from original film without edits and poor saturation and other contrast anomolies that mar this crappy set. The only problem is you need a PAL converter to play the UK sets....BUT ....I found on eBay the 30th anniversary collection from Korea and just received it....at about twice this price...but oh my the package is amazing... a beautiful book....bound like a wedding album...and the movies? The transfers are STUNNING....plus they have bonus interviews , trailers etc....After watching the Korean edition ....I put this set back in and it really made me sick...really poor quality....and for an Icon like Bruce Lee? If he were alive he would kick the butts of the profiteers at the company issueing this garbage!"
4,Legendary Bruce!,"I loved this quality and sound. Only wish they would make this in full screen as well, giving us older folks more options."
5,The only lengendary master ever live.,"No one one earth can beat Bruce Lee. He can knock out any action movie stars with with punch or kick. You see all others actions movie stars are actors only, you don't see them fight in realy life. Bruce Lee beats up anyone who challenged him when he was living.He is really a lengendary master that noone on earth can follow.Hn"
3,Not A Collection,"I am aware that this is a compendium of Bruce lee's movies from Hong Kong. But there's one problem I have with this collection. It's not a collection. ENTER the damn DRAGON is a BRUCE LEE MOVIE. If all of his films aren't COLLECTED it's not a collection. You can skip all of the pretty packaging and Booklets. I just want all of his films together. That may be a problem as far as the movie studios see it. Couldn't they settle their differences for the consumers sake. I sold my so called collection to a friend of mine a day after I purchased it. I didn't realize it was incomplete. I guess I should read the boxes before I buy my next COLLECTION. I can buy each DVD seperately and save money. Especially if the quality difference isn't that noticable. One of these DVD's isn't even an actual film. It's a documentary. Not worth it, unless you're to lazy to build your own collection."
3,Columbia could have done better,"I was really disappointed with this because I couldn't wait to pick up my set. It was basically a retread of the old laserdisc versions released 6 years ago, but without the original trailers that came with the LD. I ended up selling my DVD set and getting the MEDIA ASIA versions. Better picture but with subtitles only. I wish this could have been the definitive collection, but in the end Columbia just got greedy. I wish they took the time and care Warner did with Enter the Dragon."
3,ALWAYS stay with ORIGINAL,"Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though. THREE STARS for BRUCE."
2,Box set lacking,"Its a shame that the priveledged company owning the rights to release four of Bruce Lee's movies would not do it correctly. I gave the box set two stars and thats just because Bruce Lee is in it. The dvd's offer no added features. The picture quality in Fists of Fury is awfull! the American 'John Wayne' voice dubbing for Bruce was even worse. I would have rather had the option to read subtitles and hear the original chinese soundtrack.Summary: Don't buy this. I would recommend finding a Chinese release of these movies with a English subtitle or waiting for the set to be re-done, because this set doesn't even begin to match the quality that Bruce Lee deserves."
5,Great Condition,This product was in great condition and arrived earlier that I had expected. Thank you.
4,"An excellent, but incomplete set.","Excellent digital re-mastering of Bruce Lee's classics. Unfortunately, it's missing ""Enter The Dragon"", which you'll have to order separately since it's owned by WB and not CBS/FOX, the publishers of the set. This set is simply incomplete without it. I urge the people at Amazon to bundle them in a promotion."
3,Smaller than you'd think,"Bought this for my 3 and 6 year olds, and they both like them. The sound is pretty cool, and is not too loud that they cannot play in the next room with it while we watch TV. Smaller than it seemed in pictures, it doesn't look much like a light saber."
1,HERE WE GO AGAIN....,"No, I do no take Kiss seriously. But, at least, in their best years the released a lot of classic rock albums, with great tunes that influenced literally hundreds of bands to come.But in the middle eighties, they began to sell out to glam, and the mask was gone: the vanity and greed of Simmons and Stanley became clear for all to see. THat such hard-working and talented musicians became so shallow, it's something almost unbeliavable.This video (now DVD) is a fake from beginning to end, so bad as the newest SECOND COMING. The interviews are terrible, the girls aorund Paul Stanley's swimming pool are just models, most of them porn stars like Candie Evans and Blondi. As for the viedos, there are a handful of good old-ones, but most of them are from the glam phase.This DVD will add aboslutely nothing to you, just to Gene and Paul's pockets."
4,Good Inside Look!,"KISS EXPOSED is hilariously funny! Gene and Paul give funny interviews throughout, and the videos are awesome! The half-naked girls through the video are expected in a lifestyle like this, and even the reporter gets a little involved at one point! My favorite videos from it are ""Lick It Up,"" ""Tears are Falling,"" and ""Heaven's On Fire."" It was interesting seeing the temporary guitar players, Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John. I was rather disappointed that they hardly focused on Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick. Simmons and Stanley provide almost all the talking in this video, and discuss the band's history as well as crack jokes and do all kinds of things to annoy the camera crew! It love it when Stanley puts Root Beer in his Bran Flakes!"
2,Eager --- To be disappointed,Kiss is a great rock band. It is very difficult to find anything negative to say. Unfortunatly this dvd is an exeption. I saw the music video on t.v. for the live R n R allnight. Exposed was the dvd this version was on. So I bought the dvd -Gene and Paul Reality show-. Every important scene in the dvd was in the music video.I guess I was expecting a live concert of some type. Thank you
3,Exposed,"I could have done without the cheesy acting, but some of the interviews are good and the vintage footage is terrific."
2,No good at all,"The only good thing here is the presence of ex-porn star Candie Evans at the front cover. Man,this girl was gorgeous, with the smile of an angel and... well, I'm deviating from the product itself.This is not a good DVD. Skip it."
4,Excellent video,"Asylum is an excellent collection. Kiss just keeps getting better as time goes by, and this collection shows their great 1980's songs. The 1970's concert footage is awsome too. Although the interview with Kiss is ""staged"", they tell you the facts about the band and the way they feel about it. Paul and Gene's comical interludes are cool. I think the video could use a bit more of Eric and Bruce, but all in all, definately worth having."
3,Decent video but had most on other KISS DVDs,"4:3 picture.2.0 audio, no 5.1 surround.Video quality was OK but I had most of the videos on other KISS DVDs."
5,All for the Classic Material,"At least this release has a semblance of production to it.The greatest moments are the Classic KISS footage, and not the throw away non-makeup material. It has taken KISS 20 years to realise that the best and most lucrative material is the out and out concert footage, with all of the blasting phantasmagoria that is the original KISS.This video comes close to that original fantasy in some of the scripted material, but falls flat on oh too many ways, however, just before it goes through the floor, it gets rescued by another classic clip.There definitely should have been more of Eric Carr in the Video, but not of Bruce Kulick. However, the original is still the best, and that footage is why I give this disc 5 stars. Unfortunately it would still be better in the bootleg version, but its nice to have the Authorised version. Pity they cannot do more releases of the Classic and Re-united KISS ( However short lived that fabulous fanatasy was)."
4,Good and about time...,"This is a classic vid from the KISS vaults, very 80's. I really hope they plan to release Xtreme close-up which is a good one as well. You won't be disappointed in the tracks or quality here. Although not much is actually exposed if you know what I mean."
3,Now with 10% less protein,"UPDATE: My latest shipment was different. The taste is not as good and there is now only 26 grams of protein (was 29 grams). Minus 2 stars...*****************These shakes are very tasty. It tastes like a chocolate milkshake from a fast food joint. Add some ice cubes to thicken it up. My favorite method is adding a ripe banana and two strawberries to the blender along with some 2% milk and a few ice cubes. Other times I add a little instant coffee for a different taste.Also, this powder mixes very well with water using a blender bottle like this oneBlender Bottle W/Wire Ball-Large 28 Oz. Colors Vary."
2,Very Dissapointing,"My biggest beef with the game, that if fixed, would make it worth ten times its weight in gold would be that the Virtual Hours pass by in a matter of seconds. Pretend it's 4:00 am. If the boy walks form one tree over to another tree two feet away !POOF! It's 8:00 am. Then you go through the small cut scene where he finds the cave and!POOF! It's all the sudden 11:00 pm and time to go to bed, but there is nowhere to sleep. Other than that, the gameplay is fun, the mini-games are awesome, making tools is fun and hunting is awesome but difficult. Once you get the hang of keeping them alive for several 2 hour days, it gets a lot easier as things begin to float up on shore and other surprises. Hope you can survive long enough to escape, cause it almost made me pull what's left of my hair out."
5,Lost in blue.... sleeper hit of the nintendo ds,"Imagine, if you will, an island out in the middle of the ocean filled with lush jungles, sandy beaches, and mystery around every corner. Lost In Blue for the nintendo ds takes all of the imagining part out of it, and is one of the only games I've played that actually immerses you into a whole new world. There's a lot to do once you are on the island including finding shelter, gathering foods, hunting, fishing, milking a goat, building various weapons, tools, and furniture, and a whole lot of exploration. But it isn't all fun and games on the island, as you have to help your character (keith) and a girl he met that washed up from the same shipwreck (skye) to survive. After beating the game as keith, you will have the option to play as skye, which is a different experience in itself. This game is one of the best RPGs I have ever played, and in my opinion it is a must have for anyone who owns a nintendo ds."
3,Good game but glitches will freeze it up.,I've beat the game twice but there are glitches that freeze it and I had to re-start twice. That is bad.It's fun if it doesn't freeze up.
3,Not as good as I thought....,"It seems like this game has gotten good ratings so far, but I am not sure about it. I remember reading about this game before it was even released and couldn't wait to get it. But when I got it, I'll have to say that I was disappointed. It is not as fun as I thought it would be and your character dies too easily, so that gets frusterating. It seems like you can't go too far without starving or getting too tired first. I'll have to admit I have'nt gotten very far, yet, so maybe I will like the game more as I play. One thing I did really enjoy, though, was building the fire (blowing into the DS while rubbing a couple sticks.) The game gets a little harder when you pick up the girl because now you have to take care of two people. I'll give the game a couple more tries but I am thinking of selling it or trading it in already."
3,A lot of work!,"There was alot of great reviews (and some not so great) about this game that prompted me to buy it to see what it's all about.The graphics first of all is great. Vibrant colors and realistic. The boy moves pretty well.I rated it low because, to me, it was alot of work. You have to go back and forth, search for items, put them in your backpack. Learn how to cook. Decide what he can eat. The game keeps telling me:He is hungry.He is thirsty.He is tired.This happened so often that it got annoying. I had to hurry up and try to find some more items before he 'died'.I guess this game is suited for people who have patience, thinking and love to hunt and search for items, figuring how to use them and all that. I don't. I like fast paced games. This isn't it."
4,Sleepy's Theme,Very pleased with this southernplayalistic classic from the producers of organized noise.Takes you back before Sleepy Brown's solo journey. It's a must have for any funkdafied listener.
4,...delivers my southern-funk-fix (temporarily!)...,"...whoever got my cassette tape of this, when i find ya, i'ma whup yo 'butt'! my attempts to replace this here in louisville went in vain, because apparently that one cassette i did own was the only copy they shipped to this state!!...this aint as funky as the group mix (that 'society of soul' thang!), but this got me over for a minute...s.o.s. need to quit playin around and get back properly! if the dungeon family cd is any indication, then things look hopeful! this is pure-straight-garage-funk-band-r&b;, not your everyday radio version, so dont be lookin to shake it fast with this...jus that soul-noddin' music for you to slump back and enjoy!"
2,Not the best My First Leappad book,"Our 3 year old does not like this book very much. Colors and shapes are too small. And there is too much other information around those items to make it clear that that is what they are supposed to be learning. It says it is supposed to teach numbers, but it only goes up to 5. If I had to do it over again I would have purchased another Leappad book instead of this one."
4,read along books,"These books are nice for little ones not yet reading,but they like to have someone to read to them."
5,Great,My kids love and enjoy My first leap frog books. This book is great for learning numbers and number recognition.
2,not as good,"My daughter has 6 leappad books - this is the only one she doesn't like. I am not sure why, but it just isn't as good as the rest!"
4,Great Product,"I bought this for my cousin who is 3 years old. He loves how it talks to him. He needs some assistance on changing the pages, and can't figure out the games yet, but he is learning new words with it. I love LeapPad products and have used them for my children for years."
1,THE SECRET IN THEIR EYES,Received this movie 'The Secret in Their Eyes' in about 3 weeks. It arrived here from Argentina - the title was in Spanish 'El Secreto de Sus Ojos'. Cellophane was on CD so figured it was new. I start to play it and the DVR said that the CD was scratched and needed to be cleaned. I took it to a store and they cleaned for $5.00. Brought it home and it did play. There are English subtitles but few and far between. I saw this film on Time Warner ON DEMAND and it had full english titles so that you could understand the film. Very disappointed in this package. I would like to return it so that I can get a version that I understand. I know this is available in other stores.. It's a great film and I still would love to own it.Linda Henson
3,Need to be more observant,Ordered this as a christmas present without realizing it was sub-titled . . .probably ws good but didn't even watch it
1,I would love to review this movie,"Unfortunately, once again, Amazon stopped streaming this movie just before the end. This is a re-occuring problem with Amazon. Apparently I do not have enough bandwidth, so it is all my fault. Strangely Netflix, Hulu, Apple tv, and Sony do not share the same problem on my commercial broadband network!!!"
5,Surprises at every turn,"This wonderful film could have simply been concerned with South American ""justice"" in the mid-1970s (in this case, Argentina) but it evolves into a film with significant depth and was made with obvious great care. It is brutal and warm, sinister and compassionate, probing and surprising.While the plot, in itself, is elementary, the film is carried on the shoulders of Ricardo Darin, whose sturdy face is perfect for the role as Benjamin Espósito, an investigator with a stake in solving a homicide from years back. Nicely paired with Soledad Villamil, (Irene) who plays his partner in anti-crime, the film gathers steam slowly yet never comes to a complete boil. It doesn't have to. What takes place in two hours is gripping....the viewer would not want to be interrupted during the course of it.""The Secret in Their Eyes"" is just that. It is a film of immense proportion, terrifically acted and destined to be remembered. I highly recommend it."
4,well worth watching,"This movie gets off to a boring beginning, you've got to admit. But after about an hour in, you won't be able to pause it. The directing is brilliant! So many adroit decisions.One thing that marred my enjoyment was that the movie assumes you're familiar with the structure of a public prosecutor's office in Argentina. I found this confusing. Wait. Who's that guy? How does he have power over them? What's his job exactly? Did the guys who release the accused from prison work for some sort of Secret Service? I thought he was a judge? Is he a lawyer or a detective? Etc., etc."
5,Excellent!,This film moves rather slow the first hour or so but the last 10 minutes more than make up for it. Highly recommended.
5,Una obra maestra de JJC,Juan José Campanella crea otra obra maestra.En pocas películas puede verse una trama tan bien elaborada y coherente. No se escatima en los pequeños detalles. Ricardo Darín está excelente. La caracterización de Francella es de primera. Una obra de colección.
1,Hurts Those Suffering,"There are some who believe that MSP is a false disease, created only to hurt mothers and ruin their credibility in the medical world.Unfortunately, there are those, like me, who know that MSP is not a fictious disease, but a very real form of abuse. This book just hurts those who have suffered for years as victims.I am sure MSP is falsely attributed to many medical situations each year. However, there are also many cases in which it should be recognized, but thanks to works such as these, the authorities are scared to use this term."
1,Not a Sound Choice,"There is no doubt that this album was recorded during the height of Fairport Convention's populartity. The selections on this album are the signature songs. So what's the problem? In one word, it is the sound. This recording is like listening to someone holding up a cell phone at a concert. I get the impression that something wonderful is going on, but the quality of the recording is literally unlistenable. I tried playing it loud; I tried playing it soft. It was so garbled and tinny that listening was an excercise in frustration.If you want to delve into the Fairport Convention, this is not the recording for you. They call it the Woodworm Archives. Unfortunately, it sounds as bad as the label."
1,Typos galore,"This book has excessive typographical errors, causing students to make mistakes in the Cisco lab, and ultimately making the learning experience much more difficult.Some chapters, such as Chapter 3 (OSPF) use different IP addressing schemes in each lab, causing students to waste time reconfiguring the routers repeatly and reducing the amount of time available to spend on the more important lab portions that are specific to OSPF.Don't use this book unless you have no alternative lab manuals.Did anyone at Cisco Press try to complete these labs before publishing this book?"
4,Very Great Help,"I found this lab companion useful when I wanted some tutorials on how to carry out some Cisco tasks, and it was very helpful."
4,Pretty good,"I'm taking Cisco Communication class at school, and we had to buy this book. So I didn't have any choice :) But the book is ok, although there are some typos and stupid questions sometimes. However, everything is well exaplained."
3,nutone door bell,old technologynot very well maderecommend looking for something with a camerato tie into home surveillance as well as speaker and door bell
3,5 years is about it.,"It seems to have worked ok...as far as I can tell.It was manufactured in Jan 2005 and it is aboutJan 2010 and it is defective. It will no longerself test and throws off random chirps which indicatethat it is not functioning properly.So, $35 for 5 years (or not..as I don't know exactlywhen it failed)that is $7 per year.What is it worth to you?Is there a better option on the market?I am going to purchase a new one from Amazon but notbefore I check for a more robust unit."
1,Terrible experiences with this unit,"I live in an old house as well, and have experienced two terrible events of this alarm malfunctioning. The sound is positively ear splitting! The button on the back did not turn the unit off - I ended up wrapping the thing up in a thick blanket and throwing outside in the trash to get it out of my house. Do not buy this alarm."
1,not sensitive enough,I have owned this unit for about 6 years. I thought my family was safe. Well our furnace had a CO leak. Level of CO detected up to 70 ppm. The detector never went off. It isn't sensitive enough. It will detect levels at 400 ppm in 4 to 15 minutes (it says this on the back). The furnace repairman said to get a detector that could detect levels of 70 to 100 ppm at the minimum. I am buying a new detector.
1,A waste of time and money,"BOY! Was I disappointed. I was told that this book would help in my geneology research, but this must be an edited version. It just lists a bunch of names and not much data. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Good quality,I received the item before the estimated arrival date. Excellent quality. Would purchase items in future
1,Teriyaki rice for a sweet tooth,"If the consumer likes side dishes on the sweet side, this should do. As I do not, I've been trying to figure out how to 'doctor' it to make it palatable. The entire family agreed, ""Too sweet""."
5,WOW-Loved it!,"This book goes with Once and Again....Which was just as wonderful as this one....If you want to read about some very hot guys and watch them fall for wonderful and very strong women then this book is for you..This is a very romantic,funny,and steamy book-and as I always say about Loris books you will have a smile on your face the whole time...A 10+ book! Dont miss this one! You will be left saying WOW just as I did!!!Make sure you pick up Once and Again with this!!! another 10+ book!"
4,Gab and Jordan....Amazing,"Another great book from Lori Foster....I was touched by the tenderness of Gab. After getting the impression that he is just a playboy Lori Foster delivers us a Gab with more depth and sensitivity than expected. This was a tender and fun read.As for Jordan, you realize he has more demons to snare than the other brothers so its only fitting he requires a more troubled love interest. I found Jordan interesting and a bad boy with a big heart.Of course, like of of Lori Fosters books emotionally stimulating and lots of hot physical sex. If you liked Once and Again with Sawyer and Morgan you will enjoy Forever and Always with Gab and Jordan."
3,"Read it once, but not twice.","This book is a set of two stories of the brother's from buckhorn. All the family is cheerful, gets along well with everyone else and the men are all strong and manly.This book tells the stories of Gabe and Jordan.Gabe is jack of all trades who performs an act of heroism that he brushes off as just doing what anyone would. Elizabeth is determined to interview him for her paper on heroism. There are instant sparks between the two even as they try to resist.Jordan is a Vet and is the ""calm"" brother. He is attracted to a mother who dances at bars to feed her children. He wants to rescue her and she's been burned one too many times.I found the stories cute, but lacking substance. There could have been so much more character development. Each story deserved a full length novel and instead got the cliff's notes version. I reccomend Mr. Perfect or Open Season if you really want a lori foster book to sink your teeth into."
3,I like Genesis.,"I like the pre-80's Genesis best, I think that it would be awesome if they returned to that style or if the 71-74 group got together again like they did for Carpet Crawlers 1999, which by the way was great."
4,One of the coolest sci-fi stories I have ever read!!,"I have read White Wing at least three times since its publication. I found it to beone of the most interesting sci-fi novels I have ever stumbled across. It has everything youcould ever ask from a sci-fi story. Aliens, high-tech, fighter pilots, intrigue, battle,and great characters! The plot is intense, mixing galactic struggle, espionage and humanemotion. Since the day I read it, I have been waiting for a sequel which will probably nevermaterialize... too bad, it was a great story line."
5,worth going out of your way to read,"This is a wonderful story, as solid as any of Heinlein's early work, as current and up to date as anything selling now. Believable, interesting characters.Does anyone know if there has been other work by this author in this genre??"
4,Solid keeper,This is a book that is a must read for the Gen-Xer sci fi bluffs. All three of my Gen X children have placed dibs on it... but I am not giving up yet.
4,Gear Geometry and AppliedTheory,I'm looking for long time to have such a book in my technical libray. Now I have it. It is an interesting book and I am veryy hapy with it.
4,Not Just for Older Travelers,"As a U.S. Vet who has served and traveled extensively in Europe, I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. The scenery is stunning, especially on the Rhine River. Being a sucker for a river cruise and having a history for enjoying the travel videos of Rick Steves & Rudy - also out of Seattle, I found George Bauer's narrative style familiar - although elitist. At 41 years old, I would love to join one of these cruises sometime. Probably will as the cultural and excursion programs seem boundless. However, based on the narrative, one might think the producers of this video and the current clientele may be more comfortable without younger company. On the other hand, perhaps the passengers would love to have that variety of middle-agers to spice it up a bit. The title of this film would be better said ""The Seasoned Traveler Cruising Europe - Popular with Mature Travelers."" Old is a state of perspective."
2,Very strange,"Wanted to exchange shoes for smaller size. When i called them they said sorry, because of policy shoes that had been worn could not be exchanged. Could not understand because all he did was try on in house. When i received them back there was dirt on bottom of shoes caked in holes. Not understanding how this happened."
4,"A riveting, noteworthy testiment....","At potentially great risk to his personal safety and that of his family, Dr. L. D. Brown offers a disconcerting, inclusive, first person account of the moral duplicity and political corruption of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Crossfire is an intelligible, detailed disclosure of the the Clintons' insidious personal and political impropriety from the state level to the White House as experienced by Dr. Brown. He makes no effort to conceal his own involvement in order to protect his integrity and provides pertinent documentation to verify his claims.I, for one, am grateful for his courage in offering the truth, as he knows it, to posterity by means of historical literature. I definitely recommend that anyone who is interested in insight regarding the Clintons and their administration read and consider the content of this book."
4,Insightful,"As L.D. Brown submits a first hand account of his experiences with the First Couple, he has been submitted to the usual character assassinations compliments of the White House. It is interesting that the spinmeisters' books such as Lanny Davis, Stephanopoulous, etc. are not subjected to the same incredulous cynicism. Of course, they have no axe to grind ! Right ! Naturally, L.D. Brown may or may not be telling the truth. However, the documentation and witnesses that are continually coming out of the woodwork as this President's term draws to a close are beginning to tell an eeringly similar story. Not too may contradictions here, folks. As L.D. Brown has submitted - if anything is untrue, he is more than willing to accept the evidence to the contrary. He has my thanks for an insightful and troubling look behind the "" spin."""
2,Confusing,"There just isn't much here that you don't already know if you have been following the Clintons.L. D. Brown knew these people and found as many others have that they aren't concerned about anything except self. Mr. Brown just doesn't make supportable claims about things such as Mena. Part of the problem in the book is that no editor is mentioned nor was one used. Beyond cleaning up very bad grammar, a good editor might have helped Mr. Brown clarify his points.There is a wonderful portrayal of a dinner with Senator Al D'Amato that is worth the price of the book. By doing this tiny, inciteful piece I have to conclude that Mr. Brown just didn't have the same sort of ammunition on the Clintons. Alas."
1,[June 2011 Ship Date] DEFECTIVE TAPE,"Listen up! Tape purchased June 2011. Two days after ordering: tape taped well. Today, January 2012, after letting the rolls sit in a stable climate: adhesive is no more. Be warned!"
1,No Glue No Good,"Despite the poor reviews, I went ahead and ordered this product assuming it was a one time manufacturing glitch resulting in a bad batch. That does not appear to be the case unless Amazon has failed to take notice and work with Scotch on securing a replacement quantity. The tape I just received was so bad it failed to even stick to itself. I would avoid this item until there definitive evidence the problem has been fixed."
2,"Excellent tape, cheap dispenser","This tape is obviously made for commercial and industrial packaging, yet the dispenser is so small and cheaply made as to be useless.Take a pass on this one."
4,very strong but each roll is kinda short.,"you prolly saw in their commercial that you only need one strip for your box. i do agree that this tape is extraordinarily strong and its almost impossible to break it by stretching, but the problem is if it doesnt stick to the box equally strong yes the tape wont break but it will fall off the box if too much force is used. So you still end up using multiple stripes to secure the box if you have a heavy one. then you find out each roll really doesnt last that long."
5,love!,"I use tape constantly sending out etsy orders, and I've gotten more picky about it. The Scotch packaging tape is top notch and now I won't use anything else. When you buy cheap packaging tape, it rips easily, doubles in on itself and gets stuck, etc etc. This doesn't do that. It's a hefty tape so its easy and fast to use."
1,Does NOT stick,"This isn't even tape. The so-called ""sticky"" side barely clings to itself, and absolutely will NOT bind to any box or cardboard. Completely worthless. If I could give negative stars I would. I feel ripped off."
1,Did They Forget to Put Some Glue on It?,"That's right, this thing barely sticks. It's thick, and heavy, but it doesn't stick! What's the point?Also, these are small rolls, not very efficient. You need to get another roll after taping a couple, maybe three boxes."
1,Defective Tape - NO Stick at all,"Just got my 6 rolls of tape, and there is definitely something wrong with this batch. Maybe it's heat damage, but this tape has no stick. Completely worthless. It doesn't even stick to itself.Good thing Amazon has a great retrun policy and procedure. Just went to my order, select ""return"", it had me print return authorization notice PLUS postage labels. Just re-boxed (and re-taped with tape that actually works...LOL), and popped it back into my mailbox for pickup. Such an easy return! One of many reasons I keep shopping on Amazon..."
1,this tape is horrible,this tape does not stick at all - thickness is nice but doesn't do anything if the tape doesn't stick. maybe the product is old.
1,Awful!,"This packing tape will stick to nothing. Often when tape refuses to stick to the box, one can wrap it around to meet itself because it will stick to itself. This won't. I don't know what has happened to 3 M Company, but I will never again buy their packing tape."
3,just okay-not great,"It seems to stick so far. There are a lot of reviews stating that the tape does not stick. I tried a strip around the plastic wrap that the six rolls were shipped in. The tape stuck, however, I was able to remove it without a problem. It was very removable and able to be repositioned. Doesn't seem like that should be the case for a heavy duty shipping tape. It did stick better to cardboard boxes.I like the dispenser as it is easy on my arthritic hands. I also use the tape over the address labels so that the ink does not smear when the package ships. The rolls could be larger, as there is too much waste in this world as it is and it seems foolish to make so many small rolls and so many plastic dispensers when a larger roll would work. Perhaps a reusable dispenser would also be efficient for those who want smaller rolls."
1,Doesn't Stick,"I'm not sure what is wrong with the tape. The first roll I used was sticky. The rest of the rolls would not stick to cardboard. I have had the tape past the time to return it. I threw out 5 rolls, what a waste."
1,Absolutely Worthless,"This ""heavy duty"" packaging tape does not stick to anything! I used to love the ""Premium Performance"" Packaging Tape but it's not available anywhere now... so I am forced to buy this worthless tape. I apply it and it literally peels right off!"
1,DOES NOT STICK~,I felt like I had to write review. This tape doesnot stick at all!! Do not buy. Wish I couldget my money back.
1,Buy this if you want tape that doesn't stick to cardboard,"This tape does not stick to cardboard boxes well. I may not be a rocket scientist, but I would think that I could put tape on a cardboard box. This tape does not stick well at all. Perhaps I received a bad batch, regardless, I won't be buying it again."
1,DEFECTIVE-DO NOT BUY,ALL of the 6 rolls of this tape are defective in that they won't start going into a position to use. They tear in crooked little strips that go a couple of inches and stop. I've now tried to use sll 6 in the pack and they're all the same.I then tried to stasrt it with a sharp knife and my rewasrd is a cut on my hand.
2,AWFUL TAPE,I ship alot of items and I can't stand this tape it just won't stick. I've given up with Scotch & gone to another brand that puts it to shame.
1,TAPE THAT DOESN'T STICK!,"We purchased a box(6rolls)of Heavy Duty Scotch packaging Tape (#142-6). I have opened 2 of the rolls and it will not stick to anything. Just won't stick!!!!!!!!!!!!!Scotch Packaging Tape, 2 Inches x 800 Inches, 6 Rolls (142-6)So disappointing. This is the 1st time I have ordered office products from Amazon."
1,This is TAPE - isn't it supposed to be sticky?,"I don't know what is going on with this packaging tape, but it isn't sticky! I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape doesn't stick to anything except itself. I don't know what the problem here is, but definitely DO NOT buy this product. I thought it was a fluke, but this is the second time this has happened to me ordering this product!"
1,Not Sticky,"We've used this tape for 20 years, but lately it's just not sticky. Over the past year, we have purchased 3 packs at Office Depot that have not worked well. Some were sticky enough to get by, but the quality has gone down hill."
1,Do not buy in bulk,"Unless you plan to use all six rolls in a fairly short amount of time, do not buy this six pack. After only a few months, I had to throw four rolls away because they had completely lost their adhesiveness."
1,Awful. Doesn't stick.,"This is the worst packaging tape I've ever bought. Just got a couple rolls of this stuff and it won't stick to ANYTHING! It won't stick to the boxes I'm packing, nor any other surface for that matter. If you want completely useless crap, then buy this item."
1,TAPE DOESN'T STICK... AT ALL!!!!,"I was happy to finally stock my supply closet with lots of packing tape at a good price.When I finally got around to opening it to use a roll, it wasn't sticky... about as sticky as a post-it.. maybe!I figured it was a fluke, an aberrant roll. No. They're all that way!And now my ""return window"" has passed.I thought Scotch was a reliable brand, and has been before now, but this was a major disappointment. If it actually were sticky, it might be good tape. It is certainly tougher than the stuff I usually get that frustratingly splinters into tiny little pieces when you try to get it started. This is solid... but not sticky. So pretty pointless, unless you're going to tie it around something!"
3,Half was good Half was not sticky,"I have no idea how it is possible, but 3 out of my 6 rolls were fine and other 6 wont even stick to paper!"
1,Doesn't Stick,"This tape does not stick at all. Waste of money, never had tape so bad ever in my life. We ship a lot of packages but wont be using this tape since we don't trust that it will stick throughout the shipping process."
2,does not fit dispenser,"not good advertising. It does not fit my dispenser. and I realized this too late to return it, so I have to use the tape manually. very inconvenient."
5,SUPER,"The best tape, best price I've ever seen, length of tape is great, nice to have spares around so when I need it for that next mailing....."
4,It's packing tape - it works,"This is a good six pack of packing tape. You get six rolls and six cutters, not just one cutter and six rolls. The tape is clear tape that is good for packaging. The cutters are well designed - same design everybody uses now.Nothing too remarkable to say here. The price fluctuates, so if the price is right . . ."
4,Reliable,I have been using Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape for a few years now. I have used them to package boxes for relocation or shipping out. I have used them on plastic totes as well for reinforcement.The tape is reliable and sturdy.
2,What's wrong with this tape?,"I've used several rolls of this tape and it usually works very well so I decided to buy a bulk pack. Well, this tape will not stick to cardboard boxes. It sticks to itself great, so I have to use more tape than normal to make sure it overlaps to make a good seal. I don't know if this tape is old, or it if was not kept in proper conditions, but it's definitely not not as good as the same exact tape I've purchased in stores. I'm going to try one more bulk pack and if that's the same way, I'm returning it and cancelling my recurring shipment.Also it's super loud coming off the roll."
5,Worked great for moving,This tape is a perfect thickness and very strong. Was used to seal-up all our boxes while moving and worked great.
4,Quality stuff,"This seemed like an odd product to put on the Vine reviewers' program. I mean, honestly, when was the last time you felt the need to read reviews of packing tape? Would you ever expect companies like Scotch or 3M to put out shoddy products? Heck no. So, I am happy to oblige, as silly as it makes me feel to actually type things like: ""This is a fine, high-quality tape. Perhaps the best I've used. Sticky, thick, tough, goes on fairly easily, and is extremely clear."" Funny thing is, it's all true. But did anyone actually read this review?I'm going to give it 4.5 stars. The minor deduction being from the fact that it's not sticky enough to hold your bumper on to your beat up old Tercel. Several people complained about the stickiness. Sure, it's not duct tape, but it's not supposed to be. Seems perfectly adequate for shipping packages."
2,Didn't like the plastic part on each roll,"Wanted just a large roll of tape, hate to have to throw away plastic with each roll. Fills the landfills needlessly."
1,Crappy,Maybe my roll is bad but this tape is so shitty. The tape breaks so easily when I am trying to wrap it around the box. Its like the cutter serves no purpose because a gentle breeze is enough to pull the tape apart.
1,NO STICK,"2 out of the 6 rolls did not have any adhesive whatsoever. It seemed like the only thing holding the Scotch ""tape"" to my packages was static cling. Embarrassingly, I had to resort to another brand of tape to secure my last few packages. Will not buy again."
1,doesn't stick at all,"I bought this last year for packaging cardboard boxes and I used 1 roll. That one was fine. However, the rest of them (5 rolls) don't stick on cardboard at all. It feels like just 'post-it' adhesiveness.Since I don't have option to return them now, I have to find out other ways I can use them.So far, I had good experience with 3M products and this is the first time that I was very disappointed. I hope the batch was wrong and the later product will be fine."
1,Does not stick - Defective,"I bought a box of six rolls in early 2011 and used one roll then which worked fine. Last month I had finished that roll and needed to start another. I found all the other five rolls in the box had completely lost their adhesive power. They simply would not stick at all. I threw them out. In future I will just have to buy rolls as I need them at the local hardware store.I should add that I have used this product before and it has always performed well, except for this one box.PS: After posting this review I phoned 3M Company and reported the problem. They are going to send me five replacement rolls with no hassle. Good for them!PPS: So now the replacement rolls have arrived from 3M Company. But they only sent me one roll, not the five replacement rolls they said they'd send. So I take back my comment above about 3M's good customer service and reduce my rating of this product back to one star again."
1,Maybe I got defective rolls,"My tape just does not stick, I have used 3M tape before may times and it is by far better then these particular rolls.There must have been a defective batch made.I now have to use 3 times the amount of tape to feel comfortable that the package will not fall apart. The glue is just not sticky.Since I have already started using the rolls I do not think I can return it."
1,Defective batch?,"As another reviewer mentioned, the tape received is defective/not sticky at all. Perhaps the lot I received is from the same batch? Whatever the case, buyer beware. I have a high regard for Scotch products, the product received is not usable at all."
1,No adhesive!,"I realized why this product was offered at a discount - it has no adhesive. I don't know if it was left in a warehouse for too long, but it would not stick to anything, much less its intended use for ""heady duty"" packaging. I returned it and Amazon promptly issued a refund. I had to leave at least 1 star, which goes to Amazon for good customer service."
1,It doesn't stick to anything!!!,This tape doesn't stick to anything! I've never had less sticky tape. It seemed like the only thing holding it to stuff was static!!!
5,High quality tapes without the bulk,"For an occasional user who needs consistent tape adhesive quality, this one is for you. It doesn't have the bulkiness and clumsiness of the big reel tape gun so it's easy to maneuver and its quality is consistent. I've gone through one set previously and it works."
2,Not very sticky,"I was really disappointed with this tape, it being brand name and all. It only sticks to itself, it would not stick to my boxes, and even when wrapped all the way around onto itself the performance was poor."
2,I guess you could call it tape..,"I use this to ship packages and whenever I do, I have to double/triple reinforce each piece of tape. The tape has very minimal amount of glue. It doesn't stick very well, and sometimes not at all. I would look for something else."
3,excelent...,"the product is good, perfect to my car.Muy buen producto, lo traje hasta venezuela y ya esta en funcionamiento en mi neon año 98."
5,Super Tramp Fans,If your a true Super Tramp fan you will enjoy this information about Super Tramp and the concert afterwards.
4,"Good, but pay attention","DVD is very good, but was recorded in 80's and some people get deceptions about de sound quality and the own show. The truth Supertramp's lovers this is not matter.A good news for foreign buyers; DVD is area ZERO then runs good in any country.Enjoy it!"
1,Avoid this DVD,"This album is just crap; believe me , do not waste your time and money. Considering that in the early 80s most of the live concerts were not meant to be released to the public one may accept that the video quality is not any good but what definitely is unnacceptable is the terrible sound quality, nothing comparable to the CD. Do not get me wrong, Supertramp is one of my favorite bands ever but this DVD is crap!"
1,A definite waste of money...,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this poor-edited subpar DVD. If you are a true fan, you may find some gems, but this is not worth the $$$ to spend to find them. The concert footage is primarily from Munich 1983. Not a very flattering performance at all. The band looked tired and almost physically unable to perform. I have seen their live performances and I have seen 10x better than this! Why not compile their best stuff?If you are a fan of BOA and prior, this is not for you. Most of it is the post BOA Rick Davies new stuff."
1,Supertramp deserves a better DVD Production,"This DVD is worth just because is the only one available from this all time great band (IMHO). But be prepared to a great deception: Terrible, terrible, terrible images. Looks like they captured this footage from a copy of copy of an old VHS tape with a low cost capture card. Audio even worst! You have two options: PCM or Dolby 2.0, but don't worry, they are terrible too. The production is poor also. They simply put some clips from two decade ago in a roll. This DVD is a joke, just a way to get some money from Supertramp fans, but, Like one, I had to buy it. If you're a Supertramp fan, go ahead, it's Supertramp anyway. If you just think about buy this DVD without be a fan, stay away, you could take a bad impression about this great band."
1,supertrash,"quick! go straight to ""give a little bit"" and sit back and enjoy the show. you'll feel like you're part of the crowd. the only problem is, you're in the back row, and all you can hear is clapping. i can't believe how loud this is. it completly drowns out the vocals. this goes on through almost every song. it's nice to know that the fans really enjoyed themselves at the show, but for home entertainment, this just doesn't work. supertramp might not be a household name, but they've got enough hits captured in this 1983 concert to fill a superdvd. supertramp deserves better, and so do we. i blame UNIVERSAL MUSIC & VIDEO and A&M RECORDS for not taking this product seriously. also, the extras feel like they were collected off the floor of VH1 BEHIND THE MUSIC. if you're a true supertramp fan, stick with the VHS version."
4,Great Release!,My wife and I are both fans of Supertramp. I'd been looking for a DVD release of their concert material for the last couple of years. We both think that this DVD is a must for any Supertramp fan! I was a little disappointed that some of the other videos that Supertramp have released over the years were not included in the DVD release. Well worth the money!
1,Supertramp: The Story So Far....,"First, let me state that I am a die hard Supertramp fan, and have been since the mid 70's. OK, now that this is out of the way, I can categorically, and without hesitation state that this DVD is a waste of time. My recommendation is: Do not buy it: the sound sucks, and the picture quality sucks. Maybe, I would consider playing it on my laptop, at the airport to kill time, but certainly not on my digital surround system with a progressive scan DVD, on my HDTV. Playing this DVD on a state ofthe art system is a waste of remote control batteries."
1,Junk,Brought it to a jewelry store to get engraved and they wouldn't even do it because they said it was just a silver laminate and it would peel. It was supposed to be worth $100 and the jeweler told me it was worth less than $20. I would not reccamend the Neteya Corp. The only good thing I have to say about them is that they refunded my money quickly and easily.
5,Quality Product!,"We received this tractor/trailer today in preparation for my son's second birthday. We had seen it at a Children's Museum in our area as well as in a popular children's catelog (for double the price!) and knew it would be a hit! We are THRILLED with it!!! It's HUGE and the quality is outstanding: the tractor/trailer is made of wood with real rubber tires. The ""farmer"" is also neatly constructed of wood, bendable rope legs/arms hidden under cotton clothing. I can see my son loading lots of blocks and toys in the back of this trailer! Terrific imaginative play and practice for his gross motor skills! Honestly neater then any plastic toy out there. By the way we've ordered all the plan toy vehicles now: the bull dozer and the fork lift are on their way!"
2,This product lasted 1 week before it broke!,"After 1 week, the wheels came off and the bolts and screws went flying. Very lucky my son did not eat them! Terrible design!"
3,A Baptist Among the Jews,"With the author's excellent vocabulary, her thoughts are clearly written. She was energetic, thorough and tireless in her research by reading, conversations and personal experiences.In reading the book it is obvious that on the journey she met many loving, caring and wonderful individuals...some becoming dear friends. This alone made the writing worthwhile."
2,Loyalty to GOP versus to her Country,Christine Todd Whitman like Colin Powel and John McCain don't really believe where the GOP is going but are more loyal to it than they are to thier values and to our country. She even ran Pres. Bush's reelection campaign in New Jersey after quiting her Cabinet position because of how little she agreed with her boss. She has her priorities screwed up and her party and her country are the losers for it.To speak out now is just a way to try to get over the guilt of helping put a moderate face on extremist policies. One thing America doesn't need is more cowards like these.
1,More like Whitman's personal and political biugraphy,"This book shows just how dishonest the Republican party has become even with moderates. After all, if Christie Todd Whitman were indeed a moderate, she wouldn't be blaming the so-called ""LIBERAL MEDIA"" while at the same time saying nothing about the current righwing propaganda on the radio and tv and the rest of the media. In fact, she praises Rush Limbaugh and Fox News as trustworthy fair and balanced independents when in fact, they're not. Throughout the book, Whitman lies about being afraid of supporting an extreme conservative such as say Barry Goldwater or Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush. Yet, when push comes to shove, she's another partisan hack in wholeheartedly defending these extremists. Go ahead, Ms. Whitman, and cry all you want to. But just make a note that not everyone is going to buy your deceptive manipulation of playing the victimization game as our country is falling apart even in your ignorant bliss !"
5,Winnie the Pooh LeapPad Book,"This is a very educational toy and teaches an array of things to preschool aged children, such as, counting, identification, memory problems, etc."
2,"Loves Pooh, doesn't love this book...","My 3 year old spent a total of 7 minutes playing with this book before she asked to put a different book into her Leap Pad. When I encourage her to use Pooh again, she absolutely refuses. She loves her Pooh characters and loves her Leap Pad. But this book? It's never been touched again. It seems to simple, and 3 year olds need a challenge."
2,Pooh in Dullsville,"Of all the First LeapPad books to buy, make this the last one on your list. My daughter has NO interest in this one whatsoever! <br /><br />( I have two friends who have said the same thing. )"
1,UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECIEVED THE ITEM IN THE MAIL. IT WAS NOT ADVERTISED ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE THAT YOU HAD TO OWN A LEAPFROG SYSTEM IN ORDER TO USE IT. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A BOOK AND TAPE, AND I BOUGHT TWO."
2,BORING,"I think the LEAP system is fantastic and wholeheartedly applaud the designer and company. I think many, many families will find the My First Leap System very useful and helpful. It's also so nice to find a product that does not have unbearably loud volume settings!!We and our daughter also are fans of Winnie the Pooh. SO disapointing, then, that THIS book/cartridge are so poorly done. Many 2-year olds will find this boring and it is designed for 3-4 year olds. THIS set teaches very little and is not interesting (boring). They could have done so much with a POOH theme!! Don't waste your time with this one."
4,Can be frustrating,"On some of the pages, the items that the child is to choose are small and if the child doesn't pick ""just the right spot"" on the item it tells them they got it wrong even if its right. Very frustrating for tiny hands just learning hand coordination skills, Overall the games are pretty fun, however,I don't really feel that several of the pages are educational at all, but still fun for kids just getting started in the leapfrog system.My daughter loves the books and has gotten quite good and remembering to touch the ""go"" button when flipping pages to make the sounds go with the pages you are looking at."
3,Nice repro.,"This is a nice, affordable budget track pack add on. However the pins are very difficult to attach. My 56 year old engine loved running on this fresh steel."
5,The most beautiful voice!,"Take the time to listen to the singing violins, seamless transitions, and amazing vocals. This LEBANESE singer is a truly outstanding artist! His music showcases the fun and energy of the country's musical style as well as the beauty of their dialect. Great for Bellydancers and Middle Eastern Music lovers!"
4,Ragheb Alama - King of Lebanese Pop!,Anyone interested in Arabic Pop Music must definetly listen to this album by Ragheb Alama who is one of the best artists in this genre. He is VERY famous in the Middle East but most especially in Lebanon. This Album - like most of his albums - contains beautiful lyrics and also really great dance rythms.
4,Ragheb Alama - Musicial Genius or Master of Mockery?,"Well, I found this CD sitting around at work. Obviously, someone had brought it in and used it to listen to one of the stereo systems that we sell. Upon inspection, the artist name didn't ring a bell, so I put it in the CD player. I was very suprised to hear what sounded like east asian music, done completely with synthesizers and synthetic drums. I asked one of my colleagues, who happens to be of Indian descent, and he told me that it was more-or-less a rap version of Indian traditional songs. Regardless, I was very amused that somebody had taken the time to produce an album of traditional east-Asian music with completely synthetic instruments. I would give this album 4 stars, because it its very amusing. Ragheb Alama really has something here -- what it is, I'm not really too sure."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"When I saw that this book actually gave responses by the people he was criticizing, I was excited that this might be very informative. However, I was sorely disappointed. The responses to Searle's criticism, and Searle's responses in turn, are totally useless. Essentially, Searle and his opponents talk in completely different terms, or use the same terms with different meanings, so that when they argue with eachother, they're shouting past eachother - they simply claim that the other guy is wrong, and then go on about their own research. The only useful bit may be Searle's self-contained discussion of his own research."
2,Pretentious and Misrepresentative of other attempts,This book is a collection of extremely pretentious responses to several other authors of books on this topic. He often misrepresents (or possibly just misunderstands) many of the arguments of other authors. The only thing going for this book is that it covers many different authors who attack the problem of consciousness from different angles. One can get an idea of who the big players in this field are from this book.
4,A Place to Start,"""The Mystery of Consciousness"" is excellent when used as a reference to some of the more popular modern books on consciousness, and as such is also a wonderful starting point for a novice such as myself.Some reviews here have taken issue with Searle's position on the subject, but the advantage of being introduced to a topic by one strong voice is that the whole field seems a little more clear to me.The best recommendation for this book is that Searle's writing style is clear."
4,Unwilling to relent,The mystery of consciousness is the first book that I have read concerning consciousness and what it means to be consciousness. I found myself become increasing frustrated by Searle and his Chinese Room Argument. It seems that when a person differed from him in ideology he would immediately go back to this idea. I guess he believes that it settles the question concerning reductionism and strong AI.The other thing that surprised me was he presented no books that he actually agreed with. The last chapter made up for the rest of the book when Searle seems to open his mind to other ideas and provides some structure on where to go from there.
5,Excellent Value,This is the second camera like this we have purchased. It is an excellent camera for the price.
2,Great camera for the first month or so,"We bought one of these in the spring of '05. We took it on vacation in July of '05 and the LCD screen blacked out a few days into our vacation. I called HP and was informed that a RECONDITIONED (used) camera was all that I could get. The camera was still under the manufacturers' warranty, but their policy was to replace it with a used camera, not a new one. I had to settle for the ""reconditioned"" camera. It has been OK since then.HP's customer service is at best mediocre. There are the usual annoying and seemingly endless voice prompts in order to get to an actual service rep, and since HP has out-sourced all of its tech support to the third world, I had a hard time understanding the reps I spoke to.This camera also eats a ton of batteries and takes a few seconds to engage after depressing the button, which is annoying if you're trying to photograph anything other than a posed shot.All in all, disappointing. I will never buy another HP camera."
2,"unpredictable, unreliable","This is my second of this model camera. The company had to send me a new one when the first one's screen fried itself. Now this one refuses to save pictures. I take a picture and it tells me ""Error Saving Image"" It is really annoying when you think you have the perfect shot and then it doesn't save!"
2,I don't want another,I bought this camera in about February 2005 but didn't know enought about digital to know what I can actually get. Goes through batteries pretty fast. The recharge time between pictures sometimes causes me to miss another good shot. Takes way too much time between pressing shutter button and taking the picture. I just thought this was normal for digital cameras till I began reading later reviews. Then I accidentally dropped the camera onto a soft surface (loose dirt and sawdust)and now the lens is stuck most of the way out and will not retract and camera will not come on. Contacted HP to get it fix but will cost close to $100 and they will just send a reconditioned one. So I am in the market for another digital camera-maybe a Canon or Sony or something besides an HP.
1,terrible,This camera is the worst. I was so dissappointed with it. Everytime I use it I get so fed up that I go back to using my regular camera. The delay is so bad that sometimes it takes me 25 pictures to get it right. The batteries go so fast and always need to be recharged. I won't even take this camera out for the day because I don't trust the batteries and this light always says flash is charging and you can't snap the picture. What's the point? Spend your money elsewhere this ones a waste.We even disconnected the printer because it was useless and cheap are regular printer prints better pictures!
2,Nice features...terrible image quality,"I bought this camera on the promise that it ""blew away"" all other 4 megapixel cameras on the market in its price range. That statement couldn't be farther from the truth. The features are nice and easy to learn and use. However, the truth is most 3 megapixel cameras out there will provide better image quality than this camera. Every image is dark, cold (blue), and flat (no contrast.) I've tinkered with all the settings and nothing seems to improve the EXTREMELY POOR image quality. The flash seems to make things worse. Spend your money elsewhere!"
1,Blu Ray exactly like DVD version,"I was very disappointed when I watched this Blu Ray version of Jimi's historic concert at Monterey. I had already purchased the regular DVD version of this feature so I hoped the Blu Ray version would surpass that. I was very mistaken. Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought Blu Ray technology equals true HD which, if I'm not mistaken, should be in wide-screen format, right? Well, Jimi's whole Monterey performance is presented here with those annoying black-bars and either side of my HD wide-screen tv. Trust me, it's not the settings on my tv. It's simply the way that the film is presented on this ""blu ray"" disc. A total rip-off. Am I missing something here? If you have the DVD version already, save your money because the Blu Ray version is exactly the same presentation."
2,Bad Packaging Makes This a LOSER,I just opened the dvd about 10 mins. ago and was disappointed as soon as I saw the packaging. It has a 2-disc (overlapping each other)plastic holder.The problem is that it is a single disc edition!I was informed that the record company execs were probaly hoping you would go out and buy the c.d. and put it with the set.This should of been done like the Blue wild angel dvd.I say DO NOT BUY!!
5,Best of Nancy Wilson,"This is one of my favorite albums, my mother played it when I was child. When ever I listen to this album I think of my mother. As a matter of fact my mother looked like Nancy Wilson. This album has some great songs. Tracks like, ""(You don't Know) How glad I am, Guess Who I Saw Today, Face It Girl, It's Over, Gentle Is My Love, You Can Have Him, The Grass Is Greener, Days of Wine and Roses, Don't Rain on My Parade, When Did You Leave Heaven, Uptight (Everything's Alright). Anyone that loves Nancy Wilson will love this album."
2,Oxford Dictionary & Thesaurus,"Not good for a 6th grader. Didn't have any of my child's spelling words, child and I were both frustrated with this book. Don't recommend it."
2,Static problem,Switch works fine but there is some kind of static electric issue. Whem I touch the box and push the button to switch feeds the static charge causes my computer feed to freeze up. The metal box needs to be grounded or replaced with a non-conductive material.
3,"Works for video, but not audio","I bought this unit so that I could hook up both my Xbox 360 and PS3 to one HDMI input. Sadly, even with name brand HDMI cables (Monster for PS3 & Microsoft for 360) it only supplies video. Only a slight annoyance of extra wiring for right and left channel for each system, and adapters.*note* The only attribute Amazon gives to rate on this item is sound quality, and since it does not supply any sound, I gave it a 1. It does supply a great HDMI image, and while it required extra wiring for sound, I am still quite pleased with the box."
3,"HDMI Splitter simple, but average","I bought this because I didn't want to spend a lot on an expensive HDMI splitter. The splitter is easy to use with a simple push button, but occasionally my screen will go black for one or two seconds, which I know is caused by the splitter. When I switch from my PS3 to Cable or vica versa, the splitter doesn't always ""catch"" which means I have to flip the switch a couple of times to make it so the screen switches. For some reason, the screen will occasionally go black for a second or two while I'm watching a program, movie or playing a game on my PS3.At the end of the day, this splitter a band-aid to a problem that I will solve by buying a good Denon receiver with multiple HDMI ports. While it does its job, it is not a good long term solution."
2,"Good at first, then problems. Read my update.","This allows me to hook up my DVD player and DirecTV HD box to my HD Magnavox LCD TV. Simple to use, simple push of a button. Very high quality. UPDATE 11/2010: I thought this switcher worked fine then began having problems. I bought it so I could feed both my Blu-Ray and DirecTV box to my Magnavox HD TV which only had ONE HDMI input connection/port. (Most HD TV's now have several inputs). Well very frequently during watching DVD's the TV screen would go into a white screen static state w/audio noise. We suspected this may have been caused by the switcher and we are now sure that was the reason."
5,The perfect HDMI splitter,"If you know that you need a two way hdmi splitter and you're considering this product, buy it. Its perfect I have an hd dvr and an hd dvd player hooked up and all i do to switch inputs is press a button. The picture is clear...it has no constant power source meaning your not going to lose any picture or sound clarity. Its basically like pulling the hdmi cable from the hd dvr and plugging it into the dvd player whenever you switch back and forth, except all you do is press 1 button. People complain that ""IT DOESNT HAVE A REMOTE"" Tell me, is a remote control going to open a dvd and put in in the player????? probably not so while your up there push the button. It is tiny as hell it can fit in to the palm of my hand it cant be bigger than a pack of smokes"
3,"Works, but you get what you pay for!","This product works just as described -- you can hook 2 HDMI devices to 1 HDMI input on your TV.However, note that with a switch like this one that doesn't provide its own power, your TV signal may look less than perfect. With this box, I get a little bit of distortion (some blurry pixels) around edges with high contrast, and occasionally you'll see ""shimmering"" where portions of the picture flicker lighter or darker.This really isn't the box's fault -- it needs its own power to amplify the outgoing signal so there's no signal loss. However, those powered boxes are about $50. So for a quick and dirty solution (e.g. in your bedroom, not in your nice home theater room...), this works fine!"
1,Stinker,"""Wheel of the Winds"" follows three characters, known as ""The Captain"", ""The Warden"", and ""The Exile"" as they flee from somebody and take a journey around the world. They see a lot of landscapes and havea couple encounters with poorly described little furry creatures. And that's about it. Yes, the central problem with this book is that it lacks purpose. Although billed as a story about self-discovery, none of the main characters really catch your attention. As far as imagination goes, this book is seriously lacking. It's just too long and boring to justify reading it, despite one decent action sequence.I might say that Engh's dialogue is wooden, but I don't want to insult wood. The writing is just awful most of the time, with the characters simply pouring forththeir emotions and thought processes. It doesn't ever sound the slightest bit like real dialogue. Avoid this one, folks, cause there's nothing to see here."
4,...this will do the job though..,"I can recommend this as a worthwhile product...This product is not as good as Zip Wax, but this will get the job done...miss Zip."
3,Not as advertised,"I just returned mine because the player doesn't come with 128 built-in flash memory and an FM radio tuner remote. The player actually has a 64 MB built-in flash memory with a 64 MB add-on smartmedia. So you can't go above 128 MB at a time. The user interface is almost the same as the original NOMAD, but the sound quality is not equal. Yepp is also a little larger than the original NOMAD."
2,Average - good value,"It's okay. The sound quality isn't amazing. The main problem is the very poor shuffle program that shuffles about 4 songs and play them over and over. I think for the price it's a good deal, but personally I would prefer something with better performance."
5,nipped in the bud,"A delightful novella, which should have been longer. The questions it sets up, about physics, the soul, and the body, could fill a thousand pages. I enjoyed the characterizations, as well as the love story, and would like to know what's ahead for these two souls."
3,something was missing,"I'm a newcomer to the Penelope Fitzgerald camp. I found this one engaging and enjoyable,yet, I was left cold with Daisy. I found her a naive and rather shallow. Maybe it was because I found the breach of confidentliality disturbing. I found it much easier to identify with Fred's inner struggles. Somewhere, something was missing. I would have enjoyed more of Mrs. Wrayburn in the story. I think I want to read this one again sometime and definitely want to read more Penelope Fitzgerald."
3,make it longer or cut out the useless stuff,"This seems like a book with potential to be great, but you end up spending much of it reading about things that have very little to do with the plot. Discussions of physics when this is supposed to be a friendly romance novel doesn't quite make sense. The only truly likable character is Daisy, who is the only ray of sunshine in this book, the only one who makes much sense. If the author wanted to concentrate so badly on the intellect of St Angelicus college, she should have tied it in with the story a bit more; same with the tastes of religious beliefs they discuss."
2,A real disappointment,"Penelope Lively's The Gate of Angels [nominated for the Booker Prize in 1990] was a disappointment. The basic plot device is a bicycle collision between a fellow at Cambridge's St. Angelicus College and a young woman, Daisy, of an uncertain past. I found all of the characters and dialogue a bit too precious. Perhaps this is one of those books that only an Oxford don (who would, perhaps, appreciate the academic setting) could appreciate. It left me cold."
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"I do not work for a competitor -- only a concerned parent. While their standard non-video monitor works great, this is a total piece of junk. If you have ANY connectivity in your home, cell phones included, this product fails consistently. The first unit kept cutting out on half the screen so they sent a new one. My 15-month-old daughter is down the hall at a very close range and it cuts out of signal all the time. Then it beeps and keeps you up through the night as it searches for the signal. Total nightmare. The company, who does have exceptional customer service, sent me a replacement. No difference. Unless you plan to camp out next to the door this product is totally useless. Great concept, wish it worked. Sticking to the old non-video product for now."
1,Good for only three months,"At first, we really liked this product as it provided great sound and video of our baby. Within time, the picture started getting fuzzier and the monitor would lose the signal. By three months, the picture was completely blurred and the monitor couldn't hold the signal for more than 30 seconds-even when we were standing right outside our baby's door! We had to buy another monitor and this time, we went with a Summer model and so far, we like it much more as the video is much clearer and the volume control has more options. I don't recommend this product."
1,It's awful,"This monitor is awful, you can barely see the picture because its so dark and warbled looking, its not in color and the reception is not good. The screen loses the picture a lot and the sound is delayed. I returned it and bought one made by Summer and it was cheaper and works great. Would NOT recommend this product."
2,design trails well behind desirability,"The other reviews I read have been consistent with my experience with this product. The ideas are good and, if executed even 50%, would make this a good product. However, I should admit this is the first monitor I have tried. The picture clarity, delay in audio/video signal, interference or green/blue clusters in picture, short range (no where near 600 ft, more like 100 ft), appearance of volume bars in place of child when adjusting volume, and frequent loss of ""pairing"" between monitor unit and parent unit.... all made this a frustrating purchase and effort, especially for $200.Dan"
2,Not so good,"We bought this monitor four mos. ago and it's not that great for what we paid. The picture does not appear to be color, even in the light. The volume is super loud, even at the lowest setting. When you turn it on, you have to reduce the volume immediately, and it beeps loudly and annoyingly as you do so. In addition, the battery is now dying quicker and quicker these days.Now, the picture looks like that of a TV on the fritz, and we've never dropped or otherwise abused the monitor."
1,Not air-tight,"This is a nice leather box and looks impressive. But it is not good for storing cigars because it is not air-tight. When I hold it up to a lamp, I can see light coming through. Also, the hygrometer is not accurate. I put it in my large humidor and it gives me a different reading than my other two hygrometers (-11%). To make it worse, the hole in the lid is too large and the hyrgometer falls out. Made in China."
3,Cheaply made,"The product came quickly. The humidor is pretty solidly made. the accessories that comes attached does not fully fit with the fittings and comes off very easily. However, the accessories themselves are descent and does its job."
2,Picture doesn't match,"Ordered these thinking it was the shorts and instead received the tank top. Should have known by the description but the picture is deceiving. Other than that, the product is decent, will probably buy elsewhere next time though."
2,Sizing is way off,"The quality of the product is good, however the sizing is WAY off. I ordered a 2X and it is barely a Large. I would not do business here again, it was a waste of my money. If you need a large, buy the 2X it will be perfect and probably last a good long time."
3,"Not great, but not bad.","I watched this movie mostly because I was a Tom Tryon fan. He was very good in all his movies, and even in this one, he gave a good performance. Cinch Saunders certainly had his character flaws, but not many more than arrogant, unforgiving Colt. It amazes me that everybody raves about what a great job all the other actors did in this movie, while completely overlooking Tryon's part in it. He gave some depth to an interesting character, and handled all the action scenes extremely well. (Just try doing all that stuff gracefully with an arm strapped down!) Yes, all the actors did a decent portrayal of their characters, but Tom Tryon's brooding performance is the one that stands out in this otherwise run-of-the-mill movie."
4,One of the best,"This movie is very entertaining, though perhaps dated. I loved Anne Baxter's performance. It's a 50's post-civil war western drama (based on no historical fact whatsoever). I suspect it was made to cash in on Heston's popularity. I absolutely loved it."
4,Andromeda Season 4 Collection,"Very good plot. I enjoy good Science Fiction that uses believable technology, and ties it into a strong plot. The Amdromeda series does this. The only other Science Fiction Series to do this was Star Trek, and it and Angromeda were a creation of Gene Roddenberry"
4,Andromeda - Season 4 Collection,An enjoyable sci-fi show from Gene Roddenberry. More gritty and realistically human in some ways than the Star Trek franchise.
4,expectations not fully metT,"The season was better developed than season 1, but do not meet season 2 and 3 standard. Don't spend time on the next and last season."
4,"Bulldozer ""Self Titled""","It's not often these days I come across an indie CD that really blows me away like this one did. Well, add BULLDOZER to your want list!! I can not begin to tell you how essential this one is for your collection. These Southern California melodic hard rockers play incredible music very similar to SHARK ISLAND. The singer at times sounds so much like Richard Black that I almost thought this was the next SHARK ISLAND release. The band has some slight other influences ranging from L.A. Guns, Junkyard and Ratt but tend to stay more toward the melodic side. The production and musicianship are outstanding with killer guitars! Don't hesitate to pick this one up........Bulldozer"
4,This product was very nice to use. I ...,"This product was very nice to use. I found the creamy solution to be greaseless, with a mild pleasant smell. It worked very well in removing eye makeup. I use waterproof mascara and I didn't have to do any extra rubbing or cleansing to completely clean my eye area. I found it to be quite gentle and effective. You don't have to use a lot of the product to cleanse either. I'd definitely recommend this product to others."
2,I didn't care for the Nivea Eye Make ...,"I didn't care for the Nivea Eye Make Up Remover. On the container it states, """"Especially For Waterproof & Long Lasting Make Up."""" I used it to remove regular wear makeup and it took three applications. However, it had a nice creamy texture. I don't believe I'll be purchasing this product in the future until improvements are made. And I wouldn't recommend it to any friends or family."
5,I loved this eye makeup remover. I have ...,I loved this eye makeup remover. I have sensitive eyes and it didn't irritate them at all. It removed all my makeup without lots of fuss -- unlike what happens with other products. I'll definitely recommend it to my family and friends.
3,"I would recommend this product to my friends, ...","I would recommend this product to my friends, because it's very non-irratating and not very greasy. It didn't work as well as I had hoped though, therefore I'm only giving it three stars. I think they could have made it better."
2,still woke up with major racoon eyes,"For the $6 I paid, it could of worked better....I still woke up with major racoon eyes."
3,Good book for casual familiarization with Thai literature,"If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive book that lists ( with a brief comment or two in most cases) nearly all important Thai literary works and authors, this book is for you. If you would like a brief biography on a few of the more notable Thai literary masters of past and present, this book will be of interest to you. However, if you want a want a general description of the various forms of Thai literature ( Kap, Ch'an, Kh'long, etc), don't look here. If you require more than a cursory description of plot for any literature of the Sukhothai or Ayuthaya periods, better go elsewhere. As I stated above, this book, with a few interesting exceptions concerning biographical information on a few noted authors, is extremely generalized. Only a few pages are devoted to literature of the Sukhothai period and not much more space for Ayuthaya literature. Most of the book concerns works and authors of the Rattanagosin period and modern day."
3,Falling home falls short,"I have his previous 3 albums which I can say that I can't live without. I looked for years for another to come out finding this was the last and it had come out some time ago. Anyways, I've listened to the album several times to shrug my shoulders and say ""it's ok"". I will listen to it again with an open mind because I love the previous 3 albums. I expect that it won't be played often. If you want great music, buy view from 3rd street, start the car, and I don't know why I act this way."
2,Take a Pss,"I own all of the Jude Cole CDs, unless you are just a collector, I recommend you take a pass on this one. It does not live up to the second, third and forth albums. I am truly amazed at how someone with so much talent could not hit it bigger than he has. The only thing I can deduce from his songs is, he must have a really bad personal life. People only want to hear so many depressing songs. Maybe if Jude got on some good meds and hooked up with the newly divorced Mutt Lang, they could make music magic!!!"
1,WILL THE REAL JUDE COLE PLEASE STAND UP,WHAT HAPPENED TO THE GOOD 70ISH ROCK FROM VIEW FROM 3RD STREET AND START THE CAR??? MORE GRUNGE ROCK IS ALL WE GET ANYMORE I GUESS. A VIEW FROM 3RD STREET AND START THE CAR ARE TWO OF MY FAVORITE ALBUMS IN MY VAST COLLECTION BUT THE LAST TWO FROM JUDE COLE ARE BAD TO SAY THE LEAST...VERY DISAPPOINTING
4,Jude Cole is Back!!,"I'll keep it short: While Falling Home may not be as good as ""View"", and ""Start the Car"", it certainly qualifies as classic Jude Cole material. ""Home"" is a showcase for Jude's talents, playing nearly every intrument on the CD, and producing. ""Falling Home"" is a must have for any Jude Cole Fan!"
5,Buy this CD!,"It's been five long years since Jude Cole released I Don't Know Why I Act This Way, but Falling Home was well worth the wait. This is Jude at his best-this is one of the few CDs that I have bought in the last few years where I like EVERY song. Everytime I think I've picked a favorite song, another song will suddenly ring even more true to my ears. I guess working on his own agrees with Mr. Cole-it sure shows in his music. I'm looking forward to more great things from this talented singer/songwriter!"
3,smooth,"jude coleif you are a fan you will or should buy this cd as it contains some great tracks and some which disappointbest tracks are leave me alone ,falling home , rain on the mooni had to listen a few times before i really got in to this albumbut it has its moments !not as pop/rock driven as earlier cds start the car or a view from 3rd street(still his best) but a fair effortanything from this fantastic artist is worth listening to !!"
4,Thwarted love is given a second chance.,"It has been twenty years since Lionel Westfall and Sophie Bowerbank were discovered in a compromising session of heavy petting. Lionel's father, the Earl of Wraxham, sent his son off to war and then forced him into a marriage that added considerably to the family standing and coffers. Sophie, a lowly rector's daughter, was left behind, her stolen heart broken. She vowed to never marry, having tasted a pure love in Lionel's arms. But that was in the past, now Lionel returns home both a widower and notorious rake, with six sons, one suffering from night terrors, sorely in need of help. Help he finds in Sophie's tutoring of his children. But someone has dark plans to put an end to the quickly reigniting passion between the former couple. The Kissing Gate moves quickly and the troubles Lionel and Sophie share are nicely balanced with their more intimate interests. Recommended."
2,Couldn't maintain good start,"I was hooked from the early pages, but the story just did not maintain my interest.Regardless of how many sex book Sophie had exposrue had read, I find really don't think a spinster would be as sexually aggressive a she was towards Lionel.I also did not like the way Lionel's SIX sons took over the story. After they came on the scene, the romance was really almost like an after thought.I would not recommend this book or buy another work by this writer."
3,I'm not a gamer.,I'm not a gamer but I bought it so I'll review it. I bought this so I could play a game with my son and his friends. I like the fact that it is wireless and that you can turn the console on and off with it. I have played the PS2 and PS3 before and prefer the style and comfort of that controller much better. This one feels front heavy. And boy do they consume battery life. With traditional alkaline batteries you're not getting very far. But we use the 2500 mah or better batteries and get tons of playing time from the controllers. Thats about it in a nutshell.
3,good controller,"The controller arrived in very good condition, but no directions (not good for non-techie mom like me)"
2,"Outside good, inside not very good","The control came sealed, but brings some problems. Since it off within minutes of play, and has new batteries. With control comes with manufacturing problems, outside everything is fine, the problem is internal, I hope you fix or repair will have to be :-S"
5,saved money,bought it on amazon and saved a good amount of money. if you need these controllers i highly recommend you buy them from here and save some cash.
5,"I like the wireless controllers, but it said they were new and they weren't","I bought two controllers from a seller that said they were new. However, they were NOT new. They were not in any kind of packaging, which is fine, and a note came with the package saying that money is not spent on packaging, so that is how I could save the money I did. However, it was CLEAR that these controllers were NOT new, there was caked dirt and grime in the imprinted letters on the buttons obviously from wear and usage. They were also dirty and scuffed. I am fine with used, but I don't appreciate the seller being dishonest with that they are selling, I would have appreciated not being lied to. Otherwise the controllers work, so that is great!"
5,Guess,"It's an XBox360 Wireless Controller. Anyone looking for one, knows what it is. No review necessary. If you've never owned one before, I recommend buying Energizer Rechargeable Batterys and the Energizer XBox 360 Charger Stand. When you're done playing, plug the controller into the stand. No need to break your fingernails extracting the batteries."
3,"XBox 360, Game Controller, Wireless","The wireless controller is a nice feature, as it helps keep down the unruly number of cables between the controller/console, and helps eliminate a potential tripping hazard.That having been said, the only problem I've encountered is the 4-way toggle selector (typically used for weapons selection), as it doesn't always allow access to one of the four items, and this is quite frustrating in the heat-of-battle (try getting your arse handed to you because you couldn't change weapons while being attacked).As the controller was bought on-line, and I no longer have the packaging, I'm living with the problem, as it's too much of a hassle to try to return it for an exchange.If you're concerned with issues like this, I'd recommend you buy your controller locally (so you can return it), otherwise, take a risk and buy on-line and save 28% ($50 @ Best Buy, $36 @ Amazon)."
5,Nearly Perfect,"The wireless 360 controller is everything i have wanted in a controller. After a few minutes of playing you forget it is even in your hands. The S-type xbox controller was great but the black and white buttons were useless in most games due to thier location below the right thumbstick. For the 360 they were moved above the triggers and can now be reached without taking your thumb from the analog stick. This makes perfect sense when you think about how many buttons your right thumb all ready has to access (Y,X,B,A + analog). Besides the new button placement the controller was shrunk down slightly and seems to fit perfectly in large or small hands.And to top it all of it's wireless, not some laggy 3rd party cheap knockoff either, but identical to its wired counter-part in performance. It feels great to finally be free of cumbersome wires."
4,Warning for PC gamers,I agree with all the other reviewers in that this is an excellent controller. In fact I bought it for PC gaming since it is vastly superior to any other gamepad I've tried.The problem is it doesn't work (for the PC) unless you have Windows XP Media Center. I have the vanilla flavor XP. I haven't seen that mentioned anywhere so I thought it only fair to point out so people won't make the same mistake I did.
3,Controller,Only used it once. Came in a plastic bag. When I tried to use it again the lb and rb buttons didn't work think it was a refurbished joystick or something someone traded in. not an original out the xbox package. its in the trash now didnt have patience to deal with it. A waste of 40 bucks.
3,Back button doesn't work,"I ordered this as a replacement for my last one. The controller arrived quickly, less than a week. Everything is great about it except the Back button is broken; gotta push it down really hard to get it to work. Didn't notice until after I threw the packaging away so I guess I'm stuck with it."
3,2 - Hour Battery Packs?,"I hate having to change battery packs every 2 hours and no matter how long I would charge it,2 hours the battery pack would go dead.I could be in a Madden ranked match about to kick a field goal to win the game and my controller would stop working(at all).I don't know if the packs were designed that way or the charger didn't function right,but it would be the same story every time.Im sticking with the wired controller for now on until the packs can can fixed right(24 hours)!"
4,One extremely fragile controller.,"Whatever you do, don't drop this thing. Its awesome playing without a wire, but once you drop it you may be annoyed with the aftermath. A button becomes stuck, your player in the game moves on its own, and other things that could happen after it has been dropped. So just a warning: be extremely careful and don't endure the amount of time I have had with a semi broken controller. Mine still work, just not the way it should."
4,Everything works great...now if we only have tilt-control ala PS3,"Nothing much not to like about this control. The size and shape works well for me, and I have a relatively large hand. Much, much better than the first gen XBOX control. The best feature of the all is probably the power control, so you don't have to get off the couch to turn your xbox on. Someone just need to create a plug-in module to allow you to control the TV input control, so if you are on TV setting, you can swith to Video 1 and 2 without getting up or look for a remote controlOne last thing in feature request...I'm sure someone at Xbox division is working on...is the tilt control ala PS3. Yeah I know this will complicate the control design and weigh, blah, blah...but it definitely adds a new dimension and fun factor to any game. Call it Xbox360 pro series and charge some extra. I'm sure folks with the right game in hand will be happy to pay for it."
5,"Great Controller, Even Better Price!","Controller came exactly as described. The price is outstanding!! Might want to check into the rechargeable battery packs because these controllers tend to ""eat up"" the 2 AA batteries required."
2,Disappointed,"The seller stated that the controllers were new. Out of the three that I purchased only one was new and the other two controllers were in horrible shape. The buttons were worn and they had scratches all over the them. They were suppose to be Christmas gifts for my boys, not anymore. I will never, again purchase anything from this seller."
2,controller,controller was defective. offered a refund but the fact that a corporation would send out defective equipment is inconceivable. maybe they should test their equipment again before trying to make a quick buck and open inventory space.
5,controller,the only way to play is wireless with the price of this supossed used product why buy the wired ones this came to me with speedy shipment and was in new condition even had original pakaging with everything included couldnt be more pleased
1,xbox controller,I don't know how to review the controllers I bought since I never recieved them. I would never buy anything from Smith817 ever again. I never got a tracking number on my controllers to see where they were & I never recieved my controllers that were suppose to be a christmas present for my kids for there xbox.
4,Probably the best controller out there.,I'll keep this simple and brief. This is a great controller. It is light within your hands and fits them great. The one problem with it is maybe that the D-pad is designed in such a way that you can push in one direction but accidently push it a different direction when doing so. But that is a very minor problem for a game controller that overall is probably the best out there.
1,Epic fail for PC users,"This controller does not work with Windows. Please stop posting that it does.1. When I opened it I thought surely it would come with a cord to connect and charge over USB. WRONG. MS can't afford to give you a cord. It takes AA batteries.2. Ok so no cord, no big deal, surely it uses a standard USB cord I can just plug in like a PS3 controller. WRONG. It uses a proprietary connector designed by NASA.3. Ok so no cord, well surely I can download the software and pair it since it uses bluetooth. WRONG. It uses a proprietary communication system designed by NASA. You have to purchase a special receiver to use it.Three strikes and it was in my trash can. Not worth the hassle to return to Amazon. People wanting these for their PCs need to order the ""Xbox 360 Controller for Windows"". Those are not wireless but should come with a cord."
1,xbox 306 controller,"it says it was in acceptable shape but the fact is it was so bad dirty as *#*@and all the button sticks when pressed and on of the trigger you have to press reallyhard on.it took me one whole hr to clean it.I so regret wasting my money on it, do not by acceptable from this guy acceptable = bad maybe dosent work"
1,Peice of junk!,The guy insulted me when I told him it didn't work. I live out of town and had to go back and forth to find out it didn't work. Never again!!!!!!!!!
3,It was great but then...,This WAS a great controller until it broke...3 mothes of gentle use and now everything goes to the left. A great thing to have as long as its working though.
5,Excellent product,"This is an excellent product. Due to the fact that you can power the controller down through the Xbox dashboard and that it powers down automatically when you turn the console off, batteries and rechargeable battery packs last a really long time. This is especially in comparison to some of the wireless controllers I've used with the PS2.It is also pretty cool that there is a warning system to let you know when the battery power is low.My husband and I have pretty much been Playstation people for the past 7 years so I thought I would have trouble getting used to the new controls. I had no problems at all, it was very intuitive and has a really nice feel. Although, I will say that my left hand hurts after a couple of hours of gameplay since it is not quite used to the new positioning as compared to the PS2 controller.These controllers are slightly heavier than say the PS2 controllers as well, but part of that is due to the batteries/battery pack."
4,great controller,"I like the feel of this controller very much, the only thing that could be improved is the battery life and it wouldve been nice if my 360 came with a recharger."
2,Doesn't work well,"Button on controller sticks does not work well. Also did not state the fact that controller uses rechargeable battery, that required special charger"
2,Xbox 360 controller,"It having problem charging. You need a plug to be able to used it, without a plug you can't used it."
4,works great,"still using this controller and it works great. it's been over a year and no problems at all with it. it was a little dirty and scuffed up, but still functions better than the one my xbox came with."
1,Not what I expected,"The controller arrived without a battery cover. If that what was supposed to happen, the vendor should have made it clear that the cover was not included..."
2,You get what you paid for,"The product itself is cheap. The joysticks don't works smoothly and the entire product feels light. Not to mention, one accidental drop and the thing shatters and you can't just it again. I'm dissappointed because normally these are good quality... I must have received a defect or a knock-off."
5,Good Product,XboX 360 wireless controller it is a very good product of the Microsoft.You can play all games with much facility and comfort.I recommend like consumer all the clients whom it likes the video games that obtain one of these.
4,great price!,this was a great price for this item. We have used it since we got it!thanks for the fast shipping .
3,Happyshopper,So far the controller has worked OK - guess time will tell. Not quite sure if it was a brand new controller or a reconditioned used one for it did not come in a blister pack.
3,"Works great, buy rechargeable batteries","Range so far has been pretty good, haven't tested the limits, but with a full charge, works about 30ft away in my kitchen... if only i could see that far! Button feedback is excellent, but i haven't used any aftermarket items, they haven't worked well in my past experience.I bought some rechargeable batteries and charger off of Ebay to use both with my Wii-motes and with these Xbox remotes. So far I have not been disappointed, and it beats going through a pack of energizers every week or so."
3,remote control wireless,do they controllers have an off switch for unit or is there some kind of charging system for the controllers. and do you have to turn on xbox at the box or can the remote do it becuse mine does not.
3,It's another controller,"Works great, the only complaint is the lead time it took to get it. But I did order a few games with it at the same time just after Christmas. All in all, just as easy to buy at the local retailer."
5,GREAT PRICE!,"I had this controller shipped to me free through Amazon prime. It works, the price is unbeatable. The only downside I had was that the product was marked ""new"" but it did not come in original packaging nor did it look entirely new. Ultimately, it works and the price was right so I am okay with this purchase."
5,Great Wireless Controller! Highly Recommended!,"The Xbox 360 Wireless Controller works very well (even from across a fairly big room) and feels great in the hand, even after hours of game play.We have a total of four of these controllers and have not had any issues or problem with any of them.Highly Recommended!"
1,problems with controller,"controller sticks and made squeeking noises - returned to Amazon same day, have not received credit yet"
1,game controller broken upon arrival,i have made several attempts to return but i have not heard back from amazon.c0m
4,Wireless is perfect,"I just bought my 360 and ordered an extra wireless controller on another site (cheaper with free shipping too!) and I love them so far! They never lose connection and they are nice to hold. No wires holding you down either!My only gripe about these are that they don't come with a rechargable battery! Why make a next generation system and have the state of the art wireless controllers run on ""AA""s??? Ohh wait! We can charge an extra 12 bucks to sell battery packs and another 30 for a recharging kit!Other than that they are great! I saved the money on the recharging cable and bought the recharging dock that comes with 1 battery pack and I bought 3 other battery packs so I'd always have wireless with no wires! Thats the way to go!But SHAME ON YOU MICROSOFT!"
4,Great Wireless Gaming Experience,"No strings, no wires, just wireless!These controllers work just as great as the wired one, if not better. They run off AA batteries. I just use rechargeable AmazonBasics AA batteries, and the gaming lasts for a long time!"
2,ok. but not new,i thought it was new but definately wasn't. also different than normal xbox but it is a microsoft product. works good though
4,Like New,"Came like it said!The left analog stick was a little bit sticky, but easily fixed!Everything's in great shape and I would definitly recommend it!"
4,Controller intact but battery caddy does not connect.,The controller portion of the deal works fine but the battery caddy didn't even look like it was an x-box licensed item. Fortunately the part I needed was just the main controller. I used the old battery pack from my broken controller. This solved the problem. All in all game stop probably would have been the best choice for the item. Good deal anyway though! For me anyway.-Summonbuer
2,used and in need of repair,I order 2 controllers one had a bad circuit board so I used the parts off it. the other needed a new thumb controller so I replaced it. BEWARE OF USED.
4,"Well, what can you really say?","There's not much to say about this really. One of my controllers that came with the game fell about 6 feet onto our tile floor for the 20th time and finally bit the dust, so I bought this as a replacement. The price on Amazon at the time was $10 cheaper than most local stores, plus there wasn't any sales tax.The controller I purchased on here was ok, but it didn't seem quite as rugged as the original. The left stick made a tiny squeaking noise when used for the first couple of hours and it's been quiet since. The controller works well, as you would expect from an OEM. It just feels a little more ""cheap"" for some reason. I can't really put my finger on it. The one that fell was over three years old, so maybe they are made by a different supplier now."
5,Great xbox 360 controller.,Well what can i say other than this is an authentic Microsoft Xbox 360 wireless controller? Feels great looks great performs great. Never hurts to have an extra controller; or two or three =]
4,Great simple controller,This is a great simple controller for those needing a spare for other to play with or a backup when needed.
5,No complaints!,"Works with my Slim. Does not come with rechargeable batteries, only your typical AA, so you'll want to buy a rechargeable battery pack and charger. I recommend generic."
5,Excellent used controller,"Even tho the controller is used, it works perfectly...The controller itself is in excellent condition and everything works fine. The shipping was very speedy also."
5,perfect,ive tryed after market controllers. they just dont feel or work. this controller is the real deal. and for half the price and free shipping if you can wait a day or two
4,It's cool,I bought one which enables my wife and I play tennis becauseXbox 360 Console Includes 20GB Hard Driveprovide one only.
4,Good controller,This is my third wireless controller and I feel this controller is comfortable and light enough (even with the batteries).I think the price it's fine compared to the wired one.
3,Great,Just what I wanted :) thank you very much. I laughed when I saw it had a black battery pack; obviously used.
2,"Bought ""used""..now I'm feeling used. NOT HAPPY..!!!","I'm not sure if this representative of Microsoft or the seller, but the wireless controller has been a huge bust. It's not that it doesn't work, but every few days, I'm changing batteries.I don't think I've ever had this much problems with a controller. It shouldn't suck that much energy this quickly. I thought I was getting a good deal, but not so much. I'll never buy ""used"" again."
1,50%,"Ordered two Xbox 360 wireless controllers through Amazon while overseas. They arrived a day or so early, but only one of them worked properly. One of the controllers will only work when directly plugged into the Xbox and sometimes justs quits working. Next time i will just wait and buy from Bestbuy."
4,Frustarating for a sec but awesome!!,Well i think it is pretty awesome i mean i have 2! But these can get sort of frusturating.ps.Definately buy them!!
1,Damaged Goods,"I know that XBox controllers work. I've played on many of them that were fine. The one I bought, however, was literally falling apart. I've since fixed most of the problems, but now, there is no rubber gripping on my thumbsticks, because the day I got it, most of the rubber was already peeled off and in the bag it came in, leaving my thumbs raw from the rough edges."
1,wow this sucks,"i purchased a pink xbox controller because, well, that's just the sort of stuff girl gamers do. my red button basically broke in 2 months. i mean, it still works if i press really hard but it's just not responsive, and there's no spring-back action. it just sort of gets stuck.it also doesn't help that i just got the infamous ""3 ring of death"" on my 360 last night. I already preordered a PS3 slim and i don't intend to go back to xbox."
3,"Nice feel, terrible battery life","I like this controller, connects well and feels good in my hand. However, one huge drawback is the battery life. If you have this controller, you pretty much have to get the recharging kit because this sucker kills batteries dead. Both controllers I have used the batteries after about 8 hours of gameplay. My logitech controllers (I use for Xbox and PS2) have used the same batteries for 6 months, and are still going strong. Still, I wouldn't use the wired ones, my friends can pass by without tripping on wires and crap. Just get the charger kit."
2,A button Sticks on Brand New Controller,So I used this controller for about 2 hours the first night and realized that the A button sticks. I have never bought a brand new controller where a button sticks before. So I am not very happy about it.
3,Works,Your basic Xbox 360 wireless controller. Amazons price was $10 cheaper than anyplace else I looked.
4,Missed it by that much,"I think the wireless controller is an awesome item to own for the 360. All the same features are available that the wired one has.The good: Wireless lets you travel room to room while playing games like uno/puzzle quest where you'll recieve a slight vibration when it's your turn. Perfect if you are a little busy but don't want to disconnect offline. Perfect for people who have kids or animals or a slight hybrid of both, hehe!The bad: you need to recharge it constantly and if you play alot then you'll be recharging it every other day.Also i've already had one break and i'm an occational gamer so i'm not sure if the one I got was defective. I called xbox hotline and did manage to get it replaced after a few months. Just be warned that it only has a 3 month warranty!!"
5,wireless controllers,"Wireless is the only way to go. No wires, and clutter. Our kids love these. They fit children's hands and adults as well. They work like the older version, but without wires, the bonus part is they are smaller than the older controllers. Now you can play with out accidentally unplugging yourself during the thrill of the moment. Batteries required."
5,Great!,"This controller works perfectly. If you have a wired controller, you need this to replace it. You should get some rechargeable batteries, though, since you'll be replacing them often."
5,this superwoman is serious about music!,"when I saw that Angela Johnson writes her own lyrics, does the string arrangement, drum programming, background vocals and so on, I knew I had to give her a shot. Instantly, I thought of Brenda Russell.It was the right move! This CD is mellow, inspiring, sweet, sexy and just a refreshing body of work in the world of today's cheap ""R&B.;"" You won't be sorry adding this to your collection!"
1,"it doesn""t work on IPOD TOUCH","I bought this as part of bundle for ipod touch but sad to say that it doesn""t work. They replace this unit 2 times but none of them work, I finally found LENMAR POWER PORT from Radio Shack for $39 and it work ."
3,Works OK; Odd USB Port Mounting,"I never had any problems getting it to charge my devices (T-Mobile Wing, iPod Nano).The one downside I've noticed is that for some reason the USB receptacle is not integral to the body of the device -- it pops out (connected to the body via a coiled wire) whenever I disconnect the USB charging cable."
1,Excellent Customer Service on Faulty Product,"Like others I bought this for my iPhone 3G. The first one did not work at all. The second worked intermittently, but more often than not it did not work. Boxwave was excellent about working with me to resolve the problems, but in the end there was no consistency to when it would work and when it would fail making it rather useless. To their credit, Boxwave responded to all of my emails quickly and refunded me for the charger and adapter no questions asked, all shipping paid by them. I still have all of my cables that I have bought from them to over the past few years and use my VersaCharger all the time. It's a shame this product is still advertised as working on the 3G. They really should pull it until they fix these problems as it sullies the name of an otherwise good company."
1,Simply DOES NOT WORK with iPod or iPhone.,"I just received this yesterday. It was shipped fast and the look and feel of it is impressive. The light works great, and that's about it. When connected to my iPhone 3g or iPod Nano 2g, it does nothing. It does recharge my Kensington mini battery, but the iPhone will not charge if this thing is also attached to the Kensington at the same time. Boxwave's web site claims that this is compatible with iPhone 3g. Well, it isn't."
1,"If you buy this for Zune, you may as well burn your money!","I purchased this item to use with my Zune. At first the item does not work, and they tell you you must purchase their ""MiniSync"" cables, because Microsoft uses some sort of proprietary cable. So I purchased those cables and the device still does not work. They sent me another one of these devices, and that one does not work either. I have attempted to use it with my Zune (1gen), Moto Q9m cell phone, and Ipod Shuffle (2gen) with no luck. So unless your looking for a $40 LED flashlight, stay away from this product!"
3,Love Blake and his dimples,He's much more talented than this tape shows as seen on the David Foster and Friends DVD at the Mandalay Bay. Someone sold him short on this one.
5,Al is the man...,"If u r a Al Pacino fan then this is the book u need .I my self love every litle thing about that man.Everything from his acting , his look , the way he dresses and his personality.But it was alot i didnt know about him wich i got answers to after reading William Schoells bok Al Pacino."
4,pleasantly surprised,"Prior to trying this workout, I was a P90x girl. I love an intense workout, unfortunately at 4 months pregnant P90x was no longer appropriate for me. I browsed around for a good prenatal workout but I couldn't find anything with the desired level of intensity...i'm pregnant but I still want to feel as though I'm getting a challenging workout. This dvd really fit the bill for me. I've just began using it so I've only done Bob's segment...it left me in a pool of sweat, but the modifications allowed me to perform all the moves in a low impact manner that was appropriate for my pregnant state. Definitely looking forward to level 2 as a part of my postpartum routine!"
4,I love Bob's Style,I usually do Tony Horton so I wanted to branch out and see how Bob is. He does not disappoint! You need a fairly big area to work out though. I like the ability to choose which workouts to add-what a cool feature! Bob keeps you moving! I am not looking to lose a lot of weight I just work out to be healthy so I alternate this with other videos.
2,Poor instruction and demonstration,"The overall workout probably isn't that bad. The problem is that the exercises are not led by fitness professionals, nor are the people demonstrating them. The instructions are not always clear, and when you watch the people, they are often doing different things with varried positions and timing, so they seem confused themselves. I understand the idea of using people who have lost weight as inspiration, but I would rather be guided by someone who can do and teach the exercises properly."
2,No Jillian?,I was very said when I watched the video and there was no Jillian. I think amazon has messed up the filing because I clicked on a box that had Jillian on it and it lead me to this workout with mainly Bob. Anyone have the same problem?
2,Modest Protection,"Well, it's a half helmet with only a DOT rating. Not much to it. I wouldn't bother if I were you. Basically, you get what you pay for with a helmet - and there's too much at stake to go cheap."
4,It is a door mat - not a rug,"Football rug is a stretch. It is merely a doormat. The product is good quality, just make sure you check the dimensions you want vs what you'll get: 22""x35"""
3,Great book let down by black and white plates,"I'm a student sailplane pilot who bought this book hoping to learn about weather for gliding. I found this book to be an excellent resource for learning about what makes weather and it also includes discussion and chapters that relate to gliding, which is useful.Pagen provides you with the tools to allow you to interpret and forecast weather in your local area. I'm a southern hemisphere pilot and he usually shows and discusses both northern and southern hemisphere factors.On that basis, I can recommend it for pilots wanting to learn about weather, pretty much from scratch.Some gliding resources consider this book to have a paragliding bent because Pagen is known for other books on paragliding, but I found no bias towards paragliding.The only problem I had with the book was that the black and white plates showing examples of cloud types were so poorly printed (contrast-wise) that they were illegible. I am having to source cloud photos from elsewhere."
1,vocab rock! Musical preparation for the Sat and ACt,Returned.Difficult to understand the songs and poor tunes.
2,Not the best,"The songs contain a lot of great vocabulary, but the words are not used in context in the songs. This makes just learning from listening more challenging. You might listen to the songs and HEAR new vocabulary, but will not know the meanings unless you use a dictionary. Rock the SAT is the gold standard for vocabulary accumulation via rock and roll songs."
1,Too lame for today's teens,"I purchased this book for my SAT prep students on the advice of glowing reviews I read here, but frankly, if this book ever was hip, it definitely no longer is. The songs are corny and it is actually kind of hard to hear the vocabulary words enunciated in the singers' efforts to sound cool. I apologetically lent it to a younger student of mine who was studying for the ISEE and SSAT, but you can't fool a middle school student, either, it seems.On the plus side, the vocab lists and exercises can be a good supplement to other vocab drills, and the ""graffitti wall"" is perhaps a clever idea, but again, probably will be scorned by today's teens."
4,This book was so cool.,I think that this book was the best of the series and the saddest one too. I felt really bad for Leah at the end of the book and thought that she was in the darkess moment of her life because her step-father died and Ethan left her because she was English. I hope that everyone thought that it was as good as I did.
4,"SOOOOOO SAD, YET HAPPY","i am glad that Ethan went back to his own ways but it is so sad, yet it brings the story to an end , so I say great you don't need to write anymore stories about Ethan and Leah. If you think I'm wrong Email me."
4,Two different worlds conflict with two people in love.,"I read the first 2 books of this series, and felt this one really let us inside Leah's family for the very first time. He mother and Neil.....how much I admired his courage....Nathan....can he overcome his Amish background especially if he sees his estranged brother, Eli? Will he be happy he finds him? What of the future for Leah and Ethan? Which will triumph, love or culture? A realistic, sad ending to a lovely 3 book series, unless there are more...which I hope there are!"
2,I'm soooo disapointed......,"I may be being to critical of this, because I expected soo much more. I was so incredably mad to be really getting into it towards the end then all of a sudden Ethan leaves Leah there crying. AHHHHH. Everyone was about to slap me after a week of whining about how mad I was that it ended like that. Can't Lurlene please make a happy ending for Leah. I'm currently writing my own ending to this story!! I hope she come out with a sequal to redeem my trust in her ""wonderful"" writing. Don't read it unless you want to scream your head off and cry yourself to sleep!!Lurlene: Please redeem my trust and write a sequal. At this point in time I don't want to read another one of your books. At least you can right a sequal to tell us what happens to Leah and Ethan years later!! I beg you......"
2,Well I guess it can't be any worse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I thought that the first two books of this ""angel"" series, were some of the absolute worst books I have ever read!!! They are fast moving and so they grip you and make you want to read more. This is fine except for the fact that they are poorly written, have no style, just cranked out (as the Beatles put it, ""just another paperback writer""). I have to admit, that this last book is much better than the other two because there is some (not much) but some substance and style to it. Still, there is one thing that offends me as a feminist a Jew and a woman. In these three books God is refered to as ""he"" I know it is hard to not use pronouns, but if the auther had written a small note about it or mabye had Leah question the gender it would have been much better."
5,A really well written book.,This was the third book about Leah and her troubles. I sure hope there are more. Lurlene McDaniel is a great author!
5,one of the best books ever,"This book is truly one of the most emotional books i`ve ever read. I don`t know how any body could ever say anything bad about this book. In my opinion lurlene is one of my fave. authers .I`m probably going to end up reading all of her books by the end of the school year.Someday i`m going to meet her and i`m going to get an autograph and it`s going to worth alot of money.Please if you ever pick this book up don`t put it back down, you won`t be able to put it down=>)"
3,My thoughts on Angels,"I read all three of the Angel books. I would give all of them 5 stars except the third. I hated the ending how Ethan and LEah slpit up. I think they should've found some way to be together. Also she said that Ethan walked out of her life... why can't she visit again in the summer, and still write letters. I liked Ethan alot, but I think he gave into his parents to easily. He did what all the AMish boys do. And also what ever happened to Johan (sorry for the spelling) and Charity? I do hope that the author will think it over and continue this book onto another."
4,Not quite finished,"I really liked the Angels Watching Over Me series. They got me hooked on Lurlene McDaniel! But I was very upset with the ending of this book. I know it would've been hard for them to find a way to live together, what with Leah being English and Ethan Amish and all, but their love was so strong! I want to know what happens with Leah and Ethan, if they ever get back together. It would be wonderful if Ms. McDaniel writes a sequel."
2,Not Good,"I purchase the quickset. I was hope to save time when working on my projects. For some reason it will let go of the blade . That is not the bad part. There are two little spring on the blade chuck. When it let go they go flying ,good luck finding them. I would think twice before you buy this item.The time you save on working on your project is used up looking for the springs. I wish they would come up with some other design."
3,Had no problem BUT!!!!!,"This works well for me but, several of my fellow scrollers had problems with it and no one can help them."
1,I was a sucker -- you don't have to be,"Does everything, except work when you need it to. I've waited for the new ROM upgrade, and it's still horrible. Crashes regularly, sleeps and doesn't wake up (except with reboot), drops calls all the time, sometimes screens will be missing the button that makes them go away (OK, now what???), bump the touch screen with your cheek when on the phone (and who knows what you're telling it to do at that point), goes into ""Flight Mode"" on it's own (to turn phone ""off"", you turn ""on"" Flight Mode, and vise versa, which sum up user interface design). I have to credit both Microsoft and HP for doing a poor job, and T-mobile for selling it and not taking it back. I have a very long memory, and share my opinions. It's the worst device I own, maybe ever. Cost so much I can't bear to replace it, and not worth much on ebay, for good reason. If you want to pay extra for a PDA then chose this. If you need to make phone calls get something -- anything -- else."
1,Ipaq h 6315,"Do not buy this phone, I purchased it when it first came out and it has been nothing but trouble. marginal reception, terrible blue tooth, HP is supposed to upgrade the bluetooth still waiting. proccessor is slow, camera colors very muted super low contrast. I purchased the extended battery for $99.00( which you need) It just died after 5 months HP will not replace. this is the worst PDA I have owned."
2,Ipaq h 6315,"I have been a very happy Ipaq user since they came out. I was looking for a replacement for my old 3850. As a package the h6315 looks very good but one major downside (for me)The big downside is that it comes ""locked"" so that you can only use a T-Mobile card in it. On inquiry with HP/T Mobile you have to take out a years contract and they will only issue the unlock code after three months. I travel a lot and use my Ipaq for work with a corporate SIM card (different provider). This won't work for me. I think I'll wait and look for something less restricted."
1,Don't order steak at a seafood restaurant,"This product was not designed by engineers with Cell Phone experience.HP is a big name in PDAs but they are not on the map in cell phones - this product demonstrates this. Don't order steak at a seafood restaurant.I replaced my T-Mobile IPAQ 6315 with the Verizon XV6600 - After the grief I have had for 5 months with the IPAQ 6315 (actually 3 of them), the AudioVox XV6600 is a pleasure. I generally love HP products, but I guess they have no phone experience. I don't understand how the T-Mobile Engineers could have qualified the 6315 for use on their network.The April 2005 software upgrade only slightly improved phone operation.The HP IPAQ 6315:1. Drops incoming calls2. Drops outgoing calls on first try3. Has poor audio for both parties on phone call4. Cannot be programmed to automatically answer incoming calls while using a headset5. The navigation pad works very poorly"
5,Love this phone!,This is an awesome phone. I have owned it for about 2 years now and it's actually my second one! I cracked the screen on my first one (my fault) and I had to get the same one. I can watch 2 DVD movies or listen to music all day long without worrying about recharging. A 4 GB SD card works great on the phone. I cannot imagine living without this thing. A++++ product!
1,Junk and expensive too.,The HP 6315 should never have been released. It is unstable and has to be soft rebooted about once a day but the big problem is the cell phone. T-mobile is the carrier but I believe it is the 6315 that is the problem as we have no problems with two other Tmobile phones in the same places. Worst of all the phone shuts down on it's own and you don't know it until you look at it. I thought I had a bad unit until I checked the web users forums for the hp 6315 and saw that everyone else also had these problems and other problems I had not noticed yet.Stay far away from this wreck.
1,This item is locked for use only with T-Mobile,"Beware - this item can only be used with T-Mobile service.T-Mobile will NOT unlock this for use with any other carrier, unless you comply with the following:You must be a T-Mobile customer for 90 days (yet their minimum service contract is for 1 year, with early cancellation fees), and you must fax them the receipt indicating that you paid full retail price for this product. You will also need to provide them Part#, SN#, EMEI#, your T-Mobile acct#, and last 4 of your SSN#.It is thus recommended to steer clear of this device, because its resale value is nill."
3,You wanna get miss call?,"Just I wanna say this this is not a good phone but nice handheld. I am using this ipaq almost a year and last month t-mobile sent me new one because I was getting too many miss calls then tey sent me new h6315 but guess what, nothing is change still I am getting miss calls:( I think I am going to buy new ""cell phone"" ."
1,Very poor cell phone,"Please note that this is about HP6315 as a cell phone from T-Mobile. It is okay as a PDA but it will make you miss your old cell phone. I, regularly, experience line drops. It does not roam well at all that when you are moving in a vehicle, it is most likely that you will not have a good cell phone service. It is very slow to find a tower to connect. Since it consumes considerable amount of power, it goes to standby mode quickly and then, when you power it up, it is very slow to get signals. Its rather bulky antenna is not doing much good since it does not have strong reception at all. T-Mobile sent field tech several times to check for signal strength in certain locations where my 6315 is weak and they say that their signal is fine.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AS A PHONE FOLKS! ...but it can be usefull in many other ways, of course."
2,"good pda, rotten phone","I've had this phone for 5 months now. The pda functions work with all the reliability of microsoft. All the programs you can want are easy to download and easy to use.That said, the phone is the model of a beta! After the first downloaded patch got the thing working at all, it is full of problems. When it sleeps, calls cannot wake it up. Very often you cannot ""hang up"" a call and must soft boot the phone. The number of times you have to re-boot will remind you of every time you've given microsoft the benefit of the doubt in the past.The concept is great. And if my jaba bluetooth worked even half of the time, I would be happy. As it is I continue to miss calls and get delayed voice mails.... not entirely a bad thing, hence the 2 stars."
1,"Great PDA, but the worst phone I've ever owned","Do not buy this device if you use expect a decent phone. I have used many HP iPAQ PDA's and they are great and this one is as well for that purpose. The phone; however, is barely usable. It is not at all convenient to use, the call quality is absolutely horrible, it drops calls on a regular basis, and half the time it doesn't even ring until making one single sound just before going to voicemail.I was excited a couple of months back when HP/T-Mobile release a ROM upgrade that was supposed to fix many of the problems with the device. I installed the upgrade and IT GOT *MUCH* WORSE! Unfortunately, I couldn't find a version of the old ROM image to downgrade it back to, so I was stuck with it.After painfully using this phone for 7 months, I finally had enough and paid full price to purchase another phone a couple of weeks ago. I'm tempted to just throw my 6315 in the trash!"
3,A lesser collection of Sinatra's late Capitol period songs,"""All the Way"" is a collection of singles and B-Sides from the last years Frank Sinatra spent at Capitol Records, which means that by definition it lacks the thematic unity of his best albums from this period. However, four of the dozen songs are by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, including the title track and ""High Hopes."" Along with ""Witchcraft"" those are the three best songs on the album. You will also find an interesting take on another kiddie song, ""Ol' MacDonald,"" which is done as a sort of jazzy farmer's daughter joke. If you have the Complete Capitol Singles Collection of Frank Sinatra, then you have no need for this CD version of the 1961 release because you already have all the songs. At the very least, you probably already have the three big hits in your music library."
1,Wrong record,The only review of this CD was obviously of the vinyl version as the tracks on the audio CD version are totally different. Was there never a CD version of the vinyl record released and if so why doesn't Amazon have it?
5,Johnson Stride professional cleaner,I have used this product since we had a new floor installed in our kitchen--a combination of rubber and bamboo. It works great and doesn't leave a film.
1,This book is not clearly written,"This book jumps around critical material and content that requires the reader to open the completed lessons provided by the author to see what code/content is missing. The worst part of this is that unless you are an experienced programmer, you will not be able to understand what is happening. In fact, you will probably need to purchase another book to understand what is actually going on. These comments are directed primarily at the Flash-related lessons."
1,DON'T BE FOOLED!,"They call it ""200mg"" but in reality it is only 16mg of Resveratrol.This is very misleading.If they are willing to be misleading on their webpage and label, I would wonder about their quality control and contents as well.I won't trust them again."
2,200mg=16mg resveratrol,"Product is a bit mis-leading as it indicates 200mg/capsule which would be a good high concentration of resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxystilbene) but it is actually only 16mg/capsule(8% of 200). It is indicated on the bottle but not in the advertising. Price is not bad if you don't mind swollowing a lot of capsules. The rat study was at 40mg/kg daily."
1,Don't be fooled!,"They claim 200 mg, but its actually only 16 mg. I don't know how they get away with such a blatantly misleading headline. I wouldn't trust the rest of the ingredients or purity given Jarrow's willingness to try to trick customers.Competitors' products have honest labeling and as a result, are much more cost effective.I'm surprised Amazon allows Jarrow to continue to sell on their site."
3,It is not bad but you need to work hard,"Well it is not bad , but i had so much difficulties in the start i guess cause the author don't explain some codes so i had to rely on MSDN help to help me understanding some codes , but i did understand good at the end of the book so i guess you need to read all book before you really can grasp visual basic , i liked Mastering Visual Basic 6 it was just great but Visual basic in record time was not a bad start you need at least to know a little on Visual basic if you want to read Mastering Visual basic"
4,"Unfriendly Manual, but the router itself is good enough.","I have used this router last several years and it never fails me. I have one wired desktop, as wells as two laptops and an I-phone connected wirelessly. And all devices have good internet connection.One bad thing about this router is that the initial setup wasn't easy at all. Especially, for wired connection, I needed to change the speed&duplex; mode in the advanced setting of the ethernet card. According to the manual, the 4 LAN ports are supposed to auto-negotiate 10/100Mbps and full/half duplex. However, I had to manually set 10Mbps and full duplex for it to work. Otherwise, the desktop kept complaining ""Network cable unplugged"".Overall, I give four stars because of its reliable performance."
3,Good features but problematic DHCP client,"This router's DHCP client just doesn't want to connect to my firewall's (sonicwall) DHCP server. Sometimes disabling the SMC's firewall allows its DHCP client to work. SMC tech support told me to use an older firmware which I did. It helped, but at a later date, the same problem came back. Now I have to use a fixed IP address on the WAN side.Other than this issue, it works fine."
2,"If and when it works, it's great. Otherwise....","When my router works, it's great. However, it looses the wireless signal on a regular basis. Reseting or powering down the unit do not help return the wireless signal so it often sits as a wired router.Ultimately, it has not been worth the aggravation."
1,"Terrible, Avoid!!!!","This is a terrible router. Loses connection, Mac users can't login, loses the IP address from the modem. Terrible."
2,The Rezurecxtun of what?,"By the way ""Rezurecxtun"" is spelled, you can already tell that this album is going to be ghetto. I listen to all sorts of music, but with gangsta rap, and it's not easy to sit there and listen to a bunch of guys babble on about who they hate, and who they want to kill. To sum things up quickly, that is what this album has in it. Sac-Sin presents a lyrical massacre of violence, death threats, and gritty storytelling about being a gangsta in Sacramento (I guess it must be tough being Sac-Sin since he is ""Mr. Sacramento""...hahaha, please). Anyway, what kept me from giving this album 1 star is the fact that it actually has some pretty fresh beats composed by Messy Marv (another ""real gangsta from the streets""). Nonetheless, this album is full of violence, cursing, and threats...my solution, watch episodes of Jerry Springer or Cops and you'll save yourself some money."
3,True Soul Music,"If you like Sam Cooke styled soul, you will definitely like this CD by Ellis Hooks. Also of note, the album features Chester Thompson on drums (best known for his work with Genesis, Weather Report, and Frank Zappa and The Mothers)."
5,buy more rockwells,I think that The Rockwells are the hottest thing on roller skates! Anyone and everyone should give them a listen.
3,Does the job,"I've had mine for about a year, but I rarely use it. It does what its supposed to, but take a look at it. Its huge - and much heavier than it needs to be. If you work in a studio its fine. But its not something that you can carry around on the camera and unless you've got a good size camera bag its not something that can be tucked away easily either. So... I still use my RC2 plate unless I'm on location. If you want to see what a good l-bracket looks like check out Kirk Enterprises - but you'll need a home mortgage to switch to their system. Come on Manfrotto you can do better!"
4,Hemingway's Chair (Michael Palin),A little boring - a little short on content - a piece of fiction from a writer who should and could do a better job.
4,Clever & Compelling for Fans and Foes,"Love him or hate him, Hemingway inspires strong reactions in readers. Author Palin cleverly manipulates that fact in this witty and well written tale of a mild-mannered, small town Hemingway devotee whom it seems couldn't have less in common with the dynamic literary icon...until fate and circumstance play their parts.This will mainly appeal to Hemingway afficianadoes, but also to admirers of Palin's writings as well. His marvelous TV travel series and companion book about Hemingway's Adventures serve him well in this charming book and his own respect and passion for Papa is evident throughout."
2,Dreary walk through English life,"Michael Palin plays the English suburban characture so well when on the big screen and particularly within the framework of Python. Unfortunately it doesn't work in the book which did not keep my attention well. It tends to drone on with mild distraction and unsatisfying end. I barely raised the corners of my mouth to smile let alone laugh but obviously this was not the book's intention. What was the intention? a peep into a middle class suburban postman's life? Very possibly, but it did nothing for me Im afraid."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in Hemingways Chair. A sad loser, devoted to his employer, gets messed over, loses job, girl, andprospects. I'm a devoted Monty Python fan, and found this bookdepressing and dull."
4,Ordinary people whose lives are disrupted -- very real!,"This delightful story takes place in an English shoreline town that's just a little bit stuck in time. A new Postmaster comes in and, Martin, a Hemingway affectionado who thought he was next in line for the position, finds his life becoming decidedly unpredictable. The American lady, Ruth, who is in town researching a history of the women who loved Hemingway, in her travels finds a chair that had belonged to Hemingway himself. Love (or what is imagined to be love)... lost Love (or shared interest, which should be the base of love) found. Shady dealings. A bit of blackmail. And the chair... is it haunted? Does it contain a ghost? Is Martin delusional? All of the above or none of the above? The reader will have to decide. No matter what the reader decides, s/he should find the book charming in its honesty and realism -- and perhaps, like I do, may discover a desire to read ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."""
4,And now for something completely different...,"I liked this book from the picture on the cover to the ending. The characters were well-developed, and the book held my interest. Who wouldn't like an assistant postal manager convinced that by replicating Hemingway's milieu in his bedroom that he could write. Martin is an endearing character and I was rooting for him from the start. A remarkable first fiction effort by Michael Palin. When I reached the last page, I felt like shouting HOORAY out loud."
5,"A gentle, enjoyable read","This is a lovely book, very easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable, one of my all time favourite reads. When will Michael Palin give us another gem such as this?"
5,Read it too fast - now must wait for the next one.,"Timing is everything! I do much of my reading at work over lunch and ""Hemingway's Chair"" has been waiting it's turn on my desk for about two weeks. One book finished, it's now July 2 - time to start a new book. I really didn't know the significance of the date until I caught it in amazon.com's ""Daily Scoop"" - and I was pleasantly surprised to discover I couldn't leave ""Hemingway's Chair"" at the office! It came right home with me and I finished it this evening. Wonderfully drawn characters, funny dialogue, an ending only someone with a Pythonesque background could devise! I've enjoyed Mr. Palin's nonfiction and find him to be a fine novelist as well. (I'm not surprised, though.) It's just such a shame I read it so fast - now it'll be that much longer I'll have to wait for the next one!"
5,"A quiet tale, filled with Palin's acute observations.","Palin's writing can be as acute and filled with humor as his travel adventures around the world. It's as if you are looking over his shoulder, watching and listening to his commentary as he spins this quiet tale. You will love his characters, and want to pay strict attention to his descriptions of scenery and his characters. I've never read anything by Palin, but I've admired his work with Monty Python and have enjoyed his video, travel adventures as presented on PBS. You will love this book."
3,Interseting reading but left with questions in the end,The story line is interesting and brings you along very nicely in the beginning with a kind of slow pull but towards the end it quickly speeds up on several of the stories going on and I felt lost several times. I had to reread several paragraphs due to getting lost and losing the story line. Towards the end Mr. Palin no longer lets you in on what is going on in the character's head. I also would have liked to seen a more complete conclusion to the book. What happens to the rest of the characters in the end? You are left to draw your own conclusions. I am a Michael Palin fan (for the most part) and the book did provide some enjoyable reading but overall I felt disappointment in it.
5,Enjoyable read,I was surprised that this was written by the same guy that was in A Fish Called Wanda and Monty Python. What a great talent he has. This story is an enjoyable read with unique characters and a wonderful plot. The character of Ruthie is a hoot. It's a quick read and well worth it.
3,"An enjoyable, easy read.","An enjoyable, easy read. Palin touches on issues about government privatisation, and economic rationalism, and corporate greed, set in rural England in the 90s. A pleasant account of a little guy against some corporate thugs. There isn't too much humour, but neither is the book a heavy political tract. The major personality theme of Hemmingway seems to get lost sometimes, and is an occasional distraction from the main story, but Palin makes a good attempt to bring the two together."
2,Disappointing started off well-went nowhere.,"This book started off well, then took so long to get anywhere, by the time that it did I didn't care any more! Palin's quirky humour has been put to much better use. Several of the early characters were abandoned, and I struggled to stay with the book... to the rather disappointing end."
1,Snoozer,"Palin turns a nice phrase a few -- and I do mean few -- times in ways that remind you of his wonderful wit, but overall this is a pretty simplistic plot-driven story with a fairly uninteresting plot and characters that don't hold your attention for a moment after you put the book down. Put another way, for the last 80 pages the only thing I felt was an earnest (no pun intended) desire to be done with the book so I could move on to something else -- hardly a good sign."
3,A Real Downer,"This story was a real downer. Very depressing. I felt like I despised all of the characters. The main character is not lovable. He has a passive-aggressive mentality and keeps making poor choices which leads the story spiralling downward from the start to the end. I'm not saying it was poorly written, just not the kind of story I enjoy."
5,"Fantastic Read, with Powerful Images","I kind of wish they'd released this under a pseudonym. (Kind of. There are lots of great, unknown books around.) Deal with it; there ain't no pythons in Theston. (Must be part of that St. Patrick deal.)Palin's style, here, reminds me most of Robert Coover in ""The Universal Baseball Association"" (also a great read, with a similar sort of spiritual-development-through-fantasy/admiration theme going on.) The book's tightly, carefully crafted, which is also good for we plot-mongers who are fed to the teeth with either exploitative, violent crap and/or the formless, self-indulgent not-quite-poetry stuff that sometimes passes for ""real"" novels.This one's a must read also, for those of us looking (begging, hoping, praying...) for characters beyond the same ol' stereotypes. There isn't a flat, inhuman, dissed character (male or FEMALE!) anywhere in this story -- even the ""bad"" guys are complex in motivation and thought processes."
3,"Well constructed, but not the best design","The bag is well constructed, has well padded handles and straps, and convenient end pockets. However, I don't like the layout of the zipper on the main compartment. Rather than just being a straight zipper, it wraps around 3 sides making quick access to the main compartment impractical. In addition, you can not pick the bag up by the handle unless the bag is zipped closed. Also, do not plan on using this to put a laptop in, although the bag is not padded, a laptop in a case would be a very tight fit."
3,Not Worth the Money,"Although I don't have a specific complaint about this bag, there's nothing special I can say about it. The bag is adequate, but it doesn't have any unique features that separate it from the competition. It certainly wasn't worth the money I paid. I could have gone to a local luggage shop and gotten a similar product for less money."
4,Great Flight Bag,"I am very pleased with the Avanti Flight Bag. It arrived quickly and lives up to its description. One reason I decided on this bag was that it was advertised as ""Free Shipping"". However the purchase page included a shipping charge of $4.95. I ordered the item anyway, and while the bag is definitely worth the price I paid, I was not happy with the incorrect ""Free Shipping"" claim."
4,gentle and refined,"This early (1978) Stephan Micus recording lacks none of the tenderness and refined vision that marks all of this one-man-show's efforts. It is distinguished by its very gentle delivery, its interesting instrumentation (table harp, kortholt, zither, guitar, and vocals), and, unfortunately, its very short length--we should not these days be having to pay full price for a less than 36 minute long CD. Nevertheless it may still be the best of his pre-mid 80s material, insofar as the revealing of inner voice goes; Micus uses the zither in an especially affecting manner to set mood and motion here in the two long pieces comprising the work. Perhaps the best thing about the whole package, however, is, remarkably, the small photo-portrait of Micus set without remark on the last page of the liner notes: a wonderful study of the artistic temperament."
5,"Sonata ""Claro de Luna"" por Micus","Guardando las proporciones, nos proporciona el mismo ambiente que Beethoven logró con su sonata. Con guitarra como instrumento principal, nos demuestra las capacidades sonoras y espirituales de una música realizada con el alma, con plena y completa inspiración. Fundamental"
3,Surprisingly decent movie,"When I was a kid, I used to watch the Super Scary movies every Saturday night, at 11:30 p.m., and when this one came up, I had no idea that it was taking place out in the Old West.I stayed up and watched it and was surprised that they put together a decent story about a vampire stalking a ranch. Years later, when it came on the Sci-Fi channel, I thought enough of it to tape it and add it to my collection."
5,Great Universal Western Horror!,If your into Universal Horror then you'll love this.It's a mix a horror and western but very well made.Eric Fleming is great as the sheriff and MichaelPalin is in many universal movies as the 2nd badman or evil guy. He's perfect as the vampire whocomes into town and goes on his blood thristykilling spree. Disguised as a gunman he can'tbe killed until the Sheriff discovers his secret.Why this isn't on dvd I can't figure out. I havehad the dvd for years and watch often. I see theprice for video is quite expensive so I'd lookfor cheaper copy or dvd copy. I have seen them.
5,Hey! It was better than that!,"I'm giving this movie 5 stars because for its time it was great. Plus it shows Eric Fleming in his unpolished but still spectacular beginnings, shortly before his rising talent was cut short by a freak accident (drowning). It was a tragic loss of someone who certainly might have equalled John Wayne or Clint Eastwood (after all, he was the REAL star of Rawhide)."
2,A vampire rides tall in the saddle.,"Altho not a good film, this effort from the very end of Universal's SF/horror cycle deserves a footnote for establishing, more or less, the minor sub-genre of the horror western. (There actually had been a few films in the Thirties which fit into this category, but they were forgotten by virtually everyone until being released on home video.) Michael Pate (a sort of sinister James Coburn) is effective in the role of a vampire menacing folks on a ranch. This particular vampire is perfectly capable of walking around in the sunshine (hey, no fair!) and the fact that the climactic destruction of the vampire takes place in broad daylight greatly lessens the film's effect. Worth a look for horror fans, however."
3,Curse of the undead,It was as good as any of the Universal horror flicks. I bought it because of Eric Fleming. He was a good actor.
3,Ok Movie,"I am not a fan of horror movies, I prefer to watch anything else. So, when I got this movie to watch, I wasn't that exited. I can say that it was scary, I don't think is the best, but it accomplish its purpuse!*Sponsored Post"
1,deceiving,One of the worst horror films ever! let me say that the llorona doesnt even come close to looking like the cover.. so lame.. what a waste of money! the acting was pretty bad too.
3,"Slow moving, predictable","Very slow moving novel and predictable for the ending. The author could have done so much more with it, but then again it was just a slice of life and at times boring. It would make a good Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie."
3,Umm!!!!,"I don't know, I was expecting a little more from this movie. I like Seth Rosenfeld, and I thought that he would've taken this film to a better place. His movies always has good actors. Although, at times it seems he doesn't know what to do with them. The story is interesting, but the overall product could've been better. To me, it seemed as if it were rushed. You never know that could've been the case. Either way, I will always support Seth Rosenfeld. He's got a gift. I can't wait to see more from him--he's growing."
1,mentally challenged,This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen - bad acting combined with a ridiculous plot. It's highly recomended for adults who still read comic books.
1,what was that?,This movie is all over the place. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take from it besides confusion. This movie had to have the single worst ending I have ever seen. Don't waste your time.
1,Disappointed. Not worth the money.,Too pricey for a cheap costume. Was expecting something more durable than a flimsy foam mask with printing on the front of it. The jacket is thinner than my bed sheets and I am overall unsatisfied. The product description made it sound worth the money. The product description was deceiving. I suggest you look somewhere else for a decent costume cause I am extremely angry that I spent my hard earned money on this piece of crap.
2,Truth behind the Mask,"Having been a Jason fan since i was 8, i couldn't wait to get this costume. Unfortunately, the mask looks really fake and the machete is made of cheap plastic and won't actually kill anybody. But what do you expect for $30?"
1,Waste of Money,This is the worst pretend sex porno that I've seen. Don't count on seeing anything except chest and no privates and there are no finishing shots of any scenes. This DVD should be removed and placed under the R rating.
1,artistic???,"Why do 'erotic' movie makers spoil movies like this with ""artistic"" special effects? The sex scenes turn from full color to purple off and on in every scene except the first one in which they show a close up of some guys face who is watching the couple have sex. THis makes the scenes really boring and the purple colored scenes made me want to hurl. Sorry, i just think playing with the picture is incredibly ignorant and should have been left to the movie makers private collection if they think it is erotic."
4,Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives - Hunter,"Despite being a bit outdated, it is a good book for anyone who is considering archives as a specialty. You will need to read additional sources covering internet, digital preservation and EAD.The book is easy to read, gets to the point quickly and has good follow-up notes.Overall, I recommed it as a good starting point."
5,The Future : Cancer Provention,"As a professional, it is exciting to see this first rate team produce a book that outlines the new era of cancer prevention. The key IS PREVENTION because treatment can only go so far. This is analagous to heart disease but is in its infancy. I recommend this well written, clear and informative book.ZS, MD"
1,Mr. Duke,"I can not find a way to return this dvd disc 2 and disc 4 will not play and it said it was NEW, SO WHAT THE DEAL!!!!!!"
2,Some interesting thoughts,Although the book by itself is slim there was way too much stuffing. The first and final chapters are the most enlightening.
5,Lionel O Gauge Classic Metal Track,O Gauge track standard track (NOT FasTrack).Made in China with Lionel imprint. Worked fine as a nice layout with my older Penn Flyer set and used trains from new Lionel Christmas Train.
5,VET IS HAPPY,"BONNIE JUST GOT BACK FROM THE VETS, AFTER BEING ON THESE VITAMIN & MINERAL TABS FOR 45 DAYS. HER BLOODWOOK CAME BACK WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.She's on Chemotherapy and had not been eating well, so the vet suggested these as suppliments. She actually chews them up without having to wrap it up or slip it inside of something else. We couldnt be happier with the results"
5,Loved by my little girl,"My little girl just loves these, very similar to the ones we purchase from her vet but less costly."
3,Author's death date,"The editorial review lists Dr. Menninger's death as 1990, but according to info I found at Washburn University that lists his death as 1960."
5,"A ""must have"" chemistry resource","Contains all the information your instructors did not want you to memorize. Containing common abbreviations for chemicals and physical properties, named reactions and a glossary of common organic subjects with the references to their reviews. Very comprehensive! Good bang for the buck."
5,Lovely book,"This is a lovely book and a favorite of my daughter (now 5) and son (3). It includes a map, andif you know any Mexican geography, you can point out different places mentioned in the book to your kids. It has a lovely flowing rhythm to the words."
3,Extremely busy,"The pictures in this book are super bright and busy, some may enjoy this but I found it distracting. There are lots of Spanish words listed on one page and text that just didn't flow that well in some places on each facing page. I really wanted a nice book of Spanish words for my son and I loved We all Went on Safari but we'll be looking for something else."
5,Extremely Helpful at work,"I know that many people have found that this product is ""delicate"" but what do you expect! This is a digital, handheld, portable date stamper! You program it once and then you rock it forward to stamp the date and time and shablamo! organized!. I waited about a month to review this product to see if it was really a DYMO error or if it was operator error (mishandling etc) for the pieces to break. It is working as good as new! I use this at work 5 days a week stamping many many many many things. It is incredibly helpful to know when I processed something so that I can go back and reference at any given time."
3,Average produuct,"The product has good features and would be okay in a llimited use environment. Not built for heavy usage, and a little slow to print. Oterwise the product does what it says,"
3,It works but ...,"I needed a small portable battery powered date/time stamper for parking business, and this is the only device I can find. It does it perfectly, prints the date/time as needed. Now the but, it is not heavy duty, my first one died after a couple of months, would not print anymore. Since this is the only one I can find, I bought 2 as backup. Hopefully, it will last longer."
3,Average performance,"I use this stamp on my job to time stamp products.While the stamp looks great on the outside, it's performance does not live up to it's good looks.It misfires from time to time and multiple depressions are needed to get it to work.Also, it is hard to get it to stamp just where you want it to on the label.Overall, I would give it a grade of ""C"""
3,"Good, But Outdated","Graphic and well-written, this book held my interest--most of the time. The different stories are extremely interesting, and at times, completely horrific. The maggots and lice had me swallowing bile. A wonderful look into what doctors and nurses REALLY deal with. I only have two complaints about the book. One is that it really slowed down when we weren't in the E.R. I skimmed over a lot of the doctors' personal and office life. My other complaint is that the book is outdated. Obviously, this can't be helped, but it was still annoying. In the 13 years since this book was written, so many medical advances have been made in different areas like AIDS and drug overdoses. If you don't care about all this, then the book will probably be a good read for you. I'm sure that the medical problems doctors see have remained the same, it's just that the treatments have changed. You'll still get a good idea about the horrors that show up at the emergency departments."
5,You can get this elsewhere for less...,Warner Archives -- these sellers are buying from the Warner Brothers site. Don't be suckered. This is a great movie but the sellers should be ashamed to sell this at the rates they are charging. This DVD (and others) are almost double what the WB site charges. Just a warning to ANYONE who is thinking about buying the DVD from a secondary seller.
3,JOLSON IS MASTER SHOWMAN IN THIS FILM,"Al Jolson sings, dances, jokes and lights up the Wonder Bar. As far as the movie itself it is an above average film. However when Jolson gets going, there is no stopping him. If you want to see classic cinema, watch Casablanca. If you want to see the greatest entertainer who ever lived, all we have are a handful of films and Wonder Bar is one of them."
3,Watchable like a train wreck,"The Berkley direction is, as usual, eye-grabbing, but the film as a whole is just too dated, and in all the wrong ways to be nothing more than a curiousity now. Yes, I'm well aware that it reflects the times and shouldn't be judged by today's standards, but I'm sorry; ""Goin to Heaven"" was offensive the day it was filmed. Worth owning because nobody will believe how racist the number is until they see it."
2,"Jaw-dropping, but for all the wrong reasons","This is one of those productions that really has to be seen to be believed, and has more historical relevance than entertainment, my opinion. This is a classic example of a Busby Berkeley production before the Hays Code (in place since 1930) began being enforced in earnest, due in no small part to Mr. Berkeley's excesses.Judged on its own merits --- yes, it is offensive on many different levels, but it also features a meandering plot and some wildly uneven performances. Jolson's film career was already in a plateau by 1934 and it shows here. If one ignores the sometimes ghastly content, the musical numbers are nicely produced but are nothing particularly special.This is a useful movie to keep in mind when people are lamenting the disgraceful state of affairs in modern arts and entertainment, and harken back to the ""good old days,"" when entertainment was much more wholesome. Uh huh, right."
3,Country's Got Heart - Getting some songs twice....,"The songs on these CDs are really good....however, there is one CD that has songs from the 90s, not exactly what I would call classic just yet. I was looking more for the 70s & 80s. In addition, there is a duet CD that comes as part of the pack and it has more than half of the songs that are already included on the other CDs. It would be helpful for each song to be listed out on each CD so the buyer knows that redundancy is an issue. It is for these two reasons that I rate the pack 3 STARS."
2,Not the same as shown on TNT,I was very disappointed with this CD. After receiving the CD's we ordered we saw the TV ad on TNT again and discovered this CD is not the same as seen on TV. The CD on TNT is a 2 CD set with 32 songs while this is a single CD with 18. For the $3.00 difference I would rather have the other CD.
3,Reissued CD,"This is a good collection of country music, BUT it is not a collection of individually selected country songs to fit this title ,but it is a set of re-issued and renamed CD's.The fact that these cd's were issued before under a different title is not mentioned anywhere in the TV infomertial or in the on line ads. It is in the fine print on each cd ""Previously issued as (cd number)"""
3,An Ok set..but overpriced,"I am a big fan of country music, especially alot of the older country prior to 1995. This set is full of country music prior to this time frame. However, the quality of some of the songs sounds like they are in a barrel singing. In addition, some of the songs were actually not that big of hits, rather they were used to fill the CD set. The biggest let down was the price. A good price for this set would be around 75-85 dollars Maximum. I paid way too much for what I got 140+. Would not make that mistake again. Don't buy this set if you are pinching pennies and hoping to get a ""blow you away"" set of music. You will not be blown away and amazed...rather disappointed. If you have money to throw away...then go for it."
5,"Romantic, not sappy.",I especially liked the the fact that the songs were romantic without being sappy. I gave this item as a gift to a couple who likes country music. They said they liked it.
3,Not as great as seen on TV,"The album has a good selection of songs although it is skinnied down from the cable-advertised double CD set. My only disappointment was that the arrangements were generally not as rich as the originals of some of the songs. For example ""i don't want to miss a thing""....maybe it just shouldn't have been covered as a country song at all. The CD is still on my car CD playlist , so there's definitely some good in it."
3,Broke but fixable,"I purchased this for my 4 year old's birthday. He loves it. It's easy for him to use and makes a weird sound when grabbing which he really likes. However, after 2 days one of the ""claws"" wasn't moving. I disassembled the unit to find it had become unhooked. Thank goodness this was a screw together product and not a snap together one otherwise it would have gone in the garbage. It's not the best quality, but as least they made it so it's easily fixed and hopefully it will last until he outgrows it."
4,Fun Toy!,My boys just love this thing! They're able to pick up just about anything with it and reach pretty high to grab things from trees.... They think it's really cool!!!
1,More cheap plastic c*** for the landfill.,"More cheap plastic c*** for the landfill. Was given to my son for Christmas. Not creative...for those times when your 5 year old can't bend over to pick up that piece of whatever. I mean, it does what it's advertised to do, but is basically just another gimmicky way for some company to make a buck at the expense of the environment. I wish people would start to think about the long term effects of these kinds of essentially useless toys on the earth. Didn't anyone see Wall-E?"
1,Propaganda,"I recommend Code Name Kindred Spirit by Notra Trulock for the other side of this story. Needless to say, China is relentless in its pursuit of scientific, military (including cyberwarfare), political, and economic (including financial) intelligence. The threat is real. The resources that China deploy for intelligence efforts are vast. This review will probably end up in a Chinese intelligence data warehouse."
2,He had it coming,"Like Mr. Lee I hold a top secret clearance and I'm an Asian-American. What I don't understand is why Mr. Lee kept some contacts with foreign nationals by attending unclassified seminars/ meetings. These kinds of contacts are frown upon. Even though the information in his papers was deemed unclassified by LANL, he should have known the mere act of these exchanges raises red flags. Was he showing off his knowledge by presenting his technical papers? He should have been less naive about the whole business of working in a top secret environment. Was he naive or stupid? It's people like him that give Asian-Amricans like me a bad name and puts us under severe scrutiny."
4,"Should make us reevaluate how ""free and just"" the US is!","Thanks to Dr. Lee for setting the record straight. It's amazing that after all he endured he could triumph and tell his story for all to hear. Anyone thinking that the FBI, CIA, DOJ, are unbiased bodies should think again and read this book. You'll see how easy it is to make someone look guilty in the public eye."
1,Try Natural Flavor Instead,"I love licorice sticks, but these sticks have a perfume/cheap incense smell. The flavor isn't that strong, but it is a bit distracting. I'd recommend buying natural flavor instead."
3,It's Time for an Update,"This book provides a decent overview of the restructuring world and bond market, although a little too basic. I was expecting more of a focus on the puruchase of deeply discounted high-yield bonds and bank debt. Additionally, the book was extremely outdated. LTV has already filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy for its second time, and we have something called the internet to help with our research."
4,Joan Jett Rocks the Socks of Pet Rocks,Joan Jett is definately an ultimate rocker and this CD has the best of the best. Damn fun. Punk before Punk.
4,Good CD,"While Joan was never a great favorite of mine, she has had several ROCKIN' songs throughout the years and they are all on here. I have to give her credit, it was hard for a woman who tried to stay punkish to cross over, but she did it.I would consider her a pioneer for people, especially women musicians, whowant to keep a bit of bad girl punk to their music, and still be popular, sexy musicians."
3,I love Joan Jett,"And this does have all her greatest hits, from Cherry Bomb to I Love Rock'n'Roll.My complaint, though, and it's a big one, is that it won't play in my computer. I know artists have a problem with people illegally downloading music, etc. But it's a real pain when you actually pay money for a cd and then can't listen to it wherever you want to. I should be able to play this at my desk and I can not. It's irritating to no end. I wish these cds had warning labels so I'd know not to bother with them."
4,Lights lights lights,"This light kit is easy to install, but finding a location inside your BoX to put them where they shine out the light is the hard part.."
5,Great kids music,My sister and I wore out many copies of this tape when we were kids. It was great for long road trips. The songs are fun and light-hearted. I'm buying it for my own children. I know they'll enjoy it as much as we did.
