1,DULLSVILLE,"I saw his film when it was originally released. Robert Altman maybe have been one of the world's greatest directors,but COLD DAY was a low in his career.Sandy Dennis was brilliant as always but the ultra slow and moody film seems to go on forever.Seeing it on video years later again did nothing for me.Sometimes you like films better the second time around but not so for me in this case.It was no wonder that the film was largly forgotten shortly after its original release."
3,Amazon Editorial Review mistake,"The Amazon Editorial Reviews credits a ""Leslie Kovacs"" as the ""legendary cinematographer (Easy Rider)"". In fact it is LASZLO Kovacs. See imdb.com [...] for the proof."
4,Torment into Madness,Sandy Dennis plays Frances Austin an ultra vulnerable boderline psychotic woman who wants to make a big change in her life.As fate would have it she trys to possess a young man she sees in the park with a bizzare and devastating outcome. Directed with a sure hand by Robert Altman .A Most unusual film.
5,What a Great Read!,"This is really an incredible book! Steven Selengut has incorporated very creative insight with some highly original thinking to produce one of the best ""investing manuals"" ever written! I wholeheartedly endorse this book!"
2,a few good ideas spun out way too long,"There are a few decent things here, for example the author's idea of your stock portfolio as inventory in your personal business, but there is too much pretense at telling the reader Wall Street ""secrets"", and not enough hard analysis. And even the inventory metaphor falls down: Good stock picks should increase in VALUE, not just in price. And if they do increase in value, and the price does not get too far ahead of the value, they should not be too quickly sold."
5,HIS SYSTEM WORKS !!!!!,Steve Selengut really knows his stuff. Follow his system andwatch your net worth GROW for a change!
4,Right on the Money!,"I heard a short segment on Stu Epperson's radio show as he discussed investments with Steven Selengut. I heard enough to prompt me to search for his book on the internet. As a securities rep. myself, Steve appears to be ""right on the money"". I didn't want to put the book down until I was through. Steve's trading strategy is refreshing information that should make a lot of people a lot of money with less risk. I have even contacted him with a couple of questions and was pleased with his prompt and courteous response. Thank you Steve for sharing your success with everyone. In your next book, please remember that all ""advisors"" are not ""sharks"", some of us do put our clients first."
4,why it's 2002 and not 2201,"Message to the first reviewer - this compilation album comes from Australia. Being in the southern hemisphere, Autumn begins in March. And like the 2nd reviewer said, international songs are released at a later date here."
3,International perspective,"This is going the the review from Arizona who noted that these songs are actually from 2001-2002. It's definitly a good catch, but you have to realize that this is an import... that is, these songs were probably not released overseas until much later (at least several months) than in the U.S. So, in reality, calling them songs from 2002 is probably completely accurate...not from your perspective, but it probably is from where this disc was produced.Think outside the box... Think outside the U.S."
4,Energizers and Icebreakers Very Good for 4-H Club,We are using the activities from this book at our 4-H Club meetings. The age range is from 9 - 18 and I have had not problems finding activites that work for everyone.
2,What are these guys?,"Oh man. I don't even know what these guys are. Are they dogs, cats, or 5 dollar bills? I have no idea. I wish we could take a look at this movie 80 years in the future and see what futuristic space people have to say about busting boos with a vacuum cleaner. I mean the symbolism is magnificent, the vacuum cleaner represents the struggles of mankind to end racism while the boos represent Strom Thurman. It's a beautiful masterwork that takes a certain Narron/Dorinsky-esque look at how retarded you are for reading this review."
2,Some errors in book - disappointed,"The book is okay, but there are some errors. Chapter 7, page 123, says that ""Protein synthesis begins with the transcription process"". This becomes a quiz question at the end of Chapter 7, but according to the quiz key in the book, the answer ""transcription"" is incorrect. Also, quiz question number 1 at the end of Chapter 7 also appears to give an incorrect answer (according to the quiz key). Also, there seem to be more inconsistencies. So I am disappointed. Otherwise, if it weren't for these errors, this could be a great book - a five star instead of a two star."
1,A huge disappointment,"This book is nearly worthless. Large parts of it are just lists of organisms and there are frequent grammatical errors, typos, misspellings. It's clear it was written in a rush. The blurb on the back says ""lavishly illustrated"" which is a lie. All the illustrations, of which there are few, are not even B&W photos but line drawings, and not even very good ones at that. For example, The very first two, meant to illustrate two different organisms, are hard to tell apart. Save your money and buy something else."
3,"Okay, but not enough detail","I bought this book to help with a Microbiology class I need for nursing. Some of the more important things we are doing in lab (staining and cultures) have little detail or are not mentioned at all. For example, they mention MacConkey agar but not the others that we are being tested on. Chemical metabolism has some details, but not enough about ATP production. This book has helped clarify some things, but I have not been able to use it to the extent that I would have hoped."
3,Not comprehensive enough for science major,Well written for non-science major but not college level especially for science major. Read it for a few days and selling it back. Microbiology the easy way is much better.
2,Could be a great book....,This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?).
5,Getting Second Degree,"I'm going back for a second degree after 21 years. This book is very easy to understand and will make my class a lot easier and enjoyable. Great seller, quick shipping. I would highly recommend."
3,good idea...but a lot of errors...,"The idea of a quick review is good...but the authors have to look for some errors, like the scientific names...and others.But the content is not bad...For a first contact in the field i think it is ok..."
4,Decent but limited,A nice overview that skims the surface pretty well. The only major downside to it is that it really targets people who are going into the medical field. It seems to ignore any other applications of microbiology other than in health (e.g. environmental applications).
2,Microbiology Mystified,What a waste of paper. Nothing useful in here at all. This is more for a third grader than an adult taking a college course. Find a better book or you will be sorrowfully disappointed.
3,Ms.L,"As a school administrator, I was looking for ideas that could be implemented in a school-wide setting. The information is great for parents or school counselors."
5,FINALLY--A BOOK THAT TELLS HOW TO RAISE PEACEFUL KIDS,"If every parent had just one book on their nightshelf this should be the one. It's packed with simple, usable ideas I can use instantly to help my kids become decent human beings. The tips for helping kids stand up to bullies and learn to fight fair are worth the cost of the book alone. If more parents would read this book we really could minimize violence and raise peaceful kids. We should read this book together!"
5,It's what we need...,"At a time when confusion seems to reign, Michele Borba's book is a ressuring tool that helps to keep our family grounded. I refer to it often and my husband and I use it as a conversation builder with our four children. This book was recommended to me by a fellow physician, and I have chosen to give copies of this book as gifts. Whether a new parent or a seasoned one, this book should be in every family's home."
4,"Old fashioned, sweet story.","Not much of a challenge to read. Enjoyed it just the same. It was a change from the modern world and therefore, I recommend it."
2,Big Disappointment,"This book was a major disappointment for me. Bette was a very annoying character. She reminded me to much of Chloe's mother in the first book. Also this book did not seem a little bit cheesy to me. The fact that they decided to make Bette a spy just adds to how cheesy that this book is. The beginning and end of the book were wonderful, but the middle was very disappointing."
3,Not what I was looking for...,"A little flimsier than I thought they would be and bigger, but I took a chance to buy these online...cheap enough that it didn't matter that these were not what I was looking for -- will save them for another project later"
1,Not worth watching. Stopped after 50 minutes.,"The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch."
1,long and boring,this movie was so boring. no wonder i never heard of it. to bad it was a bomb. long and BORING
1,"Bad, just bad.","Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this."
4,It is good acting,"Because most people it seems were willing to sit for two hours watching Nicholas Cage play a drug-addicted detective - hoping somehow he will reform or find a solution or that some twist of fate will bring a conclusion to his hopeless life!And the script is also excellent - you are denied the pleasure of justice, being forced to watch him find pleasure in what is totally destructive. The script constantly draws you into taking a moral position on the subject matter - by either accepting the person's behavior / actions ... accepting / rejecting the movie altogether. I would recommend that children watch this movie with adult supervision - Nicholas Cage in this movie is not a role model to follow."
5,DIRTY HARRY MOVE OVER,"Imagine Dirty Harry with a bad coke habit, played by Nicolas Cage in New Orleans. Cage gives us an outstanding performance as someone who goes though those violent coke induced mood swings. The iguana which appears in the movie from time to time is symbolic of the metaphor ""monkey on the back."" Cage is investigating a brutal family execution and interweaves his personal failings into the process. His girlfriend is a prostitute who he protects and supplies drugs. He has a gambling habit, and owes money (bets too much on LSU) and of course steals from the evidence locker. He also shakes down people for information, even grandmothers. Makes Dirty Harry look like a sissy. Lots of drug use, bad language, sexual situations, and some violence. Good story. Plot fairly simple to follow. The movie, at time, has the feel of a dark comedy."
2,Good acting but plot is stupid and it is not in any sense likable.,"I usually like Nicolas Cages' work. He's a fine actor. However, his acting just couldn't save this rather stupid 2009 film in which he is cast as a drug addicted detective in post-Katrina New Orleans. No doubt he has a complicated life. His girlfriend is a prostitute, his father is a recovering alcoholic and his father's wife likes to drink a whole lot of beer. His world is one of drug addiction and corruption and there's not a single character that is in any sense likable. To top this all off, it is so boring that I fell asleep. Definitely not recommended."
2,Booooooring,"Alright, this movie is boring. I watched it hoping that it would get better and it didn't. I had a lot of high hopes for this movie based on the reviews I read before watching it. Yes, Nick Cage did a good job with what he had and Eva as always is beautiful but that is pretty much the highlight of the movie."
2,It doth suck.,"I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being ""artsy"" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."
2,trying hard but fail to impress,"If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all."
1,Is this movie a joke?,"Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The acting, the plot, everything... completely just... BAD. Why do people enjoy this movie?"
1,Stay Away,This just plain bad. Boring..... I did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting. It was a waste of my time.
1,junk,I tried giving this movie a chance... watched it all the way thru... even though I was going to shut it off multiple times... this is probably the worst movie I've watched ever...
3,Great Movie for Cage fans,"I really enjoyed watching Nicolas Cage develop the character of the lead; I felt that the director rushed things at first, we don't get to see enough of what makes this officer tick at the beginning of the film. Once the premise of the film has been set, however, there is an interesting interplay between ""good cop"" and ""bad cop"" here that is well worth the time spent watching the movie. The overall plot is predictable, so enjoy watching Cage play yet another off the wall specimen."
1,bad isn't fitting,"can not believe I watched the whole movie, I kept hoping it could get better. Never did get any better, only worse"
1,Worst Movie EVER!,"Horrible Movie, worst I have ever seen! Nick Cage's career is definitely over if it wasn't before this piece of garbage!"
1,AWFUL!,"I have to say, this was the WORST Nic Cage movie I have ever seen! The director is horrible, it looks like a cheap movie and why waste your time? And Val Kilmer, dude, lose some weight, you make me want to start working out more just seeing you! He looked his best in Top Gun, but ever since that movie, and Batman, he has let himself go! I am not trying to judge, but he used to be nice to look at...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I am glad it was free thru the Prime, thank goodness!"
1,worst.........movie............ever,"Go break open a red light camera and steal the film. Watch that. It will have 10,000 times better acting and a much more coherent plot too!"
2,not good,the service was good on this movie.. came quickly and in timely mode.. but the movie sucked.. it started off good.. but in the middle.. it lost its appeal.. he was a bad lieutenant.. but it just didn't catch and keep my eye.. and towards the end.. it was like.. what is going on.. it changed completely from the beginning..N. Cage is good actor.. but Eva.. she really didn't have a plot...
1,"Dumb, Bad, Really Bad",This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies but this is so far beneath him I can't imagine why he would even do it.
1,Blu-Ray Review,"What a terrible movie, garbage. It totally sucks. What is Hollywood coming to. It seems they are running out of stories to make movies about. What garbage. Good Lord. Right up there with Boondock Saints 2 and Smokin Aces 2."
1,LAST Nicolas Cage film for me!,There is not ONE redeemable quality about this film. Period. Nicolas Cage is at the bottom of the barrel. He now has absolutely NO range. The acting in this was worse than a low budget B movie. I think he seriously was on something! So here we are New Orleans Post Katrina. Nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble. I couldn't figure out who was coming or going. I was baffled the entire movie! The lines were HORRIBLE! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!
1,Worst Lieutenate EVER,"I like Nicolas Cage, but this movie was a waste of time-BAD story, CRAPPY acting...Don't waste your time on this GARBAGE!"
3,Not as bad as I thought it would be!,"Not overly engaging, but this is an entertaining while a quite disturbing look at the downward spiral of a good cop. This movie must be influenced in some sense by Bad Lieutenant as the entire film is reminiscent of that film, but softened to allow the viewer to like the main character instead of wishing for horrible things to happen to him :)"
5,"Not for everyone, but if it's for you - you're in luck","Arguably one of Werner Herzog's best films. Cage packs a punch with some intense acting. Of course it's edgy and not for everyone as well as pushes the limits of traditional film-making. Get tranced by extra-long shots of wildlife as the music trips you into a 'though-you-were on drugs' daze. Quirky humor, crazed rants and a man breaking all the rules in a wreckless but focused and effective way. I'm not one to watch movies more than once, but have seen this one at least three times."
4,All Nicolas Cage,"He is such a good actor that he can take this ""plot"" and make a good movie out of it."
4,Drowning at midnight,"I enjoyed this. Get to see N Cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick...a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy. He starts off living in a nightmare, and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat. It all takes place in New Orleans, a city where dissipation is a career. During the lowest part of Cage's crash dive, Herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas. Disconcerting, but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment. This film is a mesmerizing ride to hell, with Cage as the perfect conductor. There is a light at the end of all this, preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer."
3,Didn't see the original but this one is ridiculous,"1. Glorifies drugs and corruption. Maybe that's how it is in NO, but it gets old seeing Cage act as bad as the criminals he pursues.2. Why does Cage sound like he has a wad of chaw or gum in his mouth during the middle part of the movie?3. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good. I guess that's all we get with free Amazon Prime, at least they added a couple new movies finally."
1,Horribly Bad,"Begs comparisons to Keitel's original and fails on every level. It never creates sympathy for the gritty immoral world this cardboard cutout inhabits. It's easily Cage's worst performance and the all time worst use of music in a drama ever. Unlike man of steel Keitel, this clown would have overdosed or been shot 10 times over. Any rookie cop could point out a dozen giant plot holes."
2,What did I watch?,So he's a dirty cop and an all around horrible person. Spoiler... Everything worked out in the end? What the heck was the point of that movie? Seriously... everything worked out in the end?I don't know why I continued to watch.
1,The Worst Movie Ever,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This movie only goes to show that Nicolas Cage and Val Kilmer are definitely washed up as actors. I wish I could get my money and my time back on this movie. I just want to put my eyes out with a cordless drill thinking how much I watched of this trash before turning it off.
1,"""this movie is awful""",there is no words to describe this movie! all i can say this movie sucks and it was awful!
1,What a complete waste of time,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long-long time. The plot is very unimaginative, and is active is plain horrible.There isn't much more to say."
1,"Bad, bad movie","Even Cage, with some genius acting in parts, couldn't save this bad movie.One of the wosre movies I have ever watched.Why do they keep hiring Eva Mendes - she acts like a piece of wood."
2,boring,"How did this collection of letters make it to print...when there are scores of personalities whose letters I'd love to read in a collection that haven't? These letters are very boring and he did not write to many notable people (a few to McCartney, Lennon and Olivier). Before you read about a theater critic, read what William Goldman said in his legendary book about Broadway THE SEASON, in the chapter titled ""The Approvers."" That tells you all about theater critics you need to know. THEN you can decide whether to read this one of Tynan's letters. I don't think this book would have made it to print if Tynan's wife hadn't been shoving it down publisher's and editor's throats. Dull, dull, dull, except for about five of the letters."
5,Underbelly Regency Style,"This book shocked me, educated me and was truly a page turner.I purchased this book as I am doing some research into the period and it didn't disappoint. The book focuses on the darker side of life which is present in every society in some form.If you are looking to understand our history and human nature you will discover that soccer hooliganism is nothing new."
3,House Arrest,I picked up Meridian because I had read that Pooley was an influence on some Latin bands that I follow. What Pooley presents is credible and journeyman House music. The grooves are intracate but repitive. I found thebands that Pooley has influenced to be more interesting than Pooley's own music. I have to admit that I am not a fan of straight House music. Although I do enjoy House-influenced music. I would recommend checking out Plastilina Mosh or Titan.
2,Not quite the booze I expected,"This is an updated publication of a c. 1980 text. It is very informative on the properties of fuel alcohol and the different raw material possibilities. It also explains in some detail how to make ethanol on the farm-scale from improvised DIY equipment.It would benefit from a more up-to-date context and a slightly more commercial orientation, in my opinion."
3,Brazilian Citizen opinion use of alcohol as engine's fuel.,"In 1975 the Brazilian government had sucessfully introduced Alcool using as Fuel in wide range. We already produced about 6 million alcohol fuelled Vehicles in this period. Our gasoline is not pure, it is 1,1% to the 25% alcohol mixed. We avoided 110 million tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere. We saved about 11,5 billion American dollars in petroleum imports.North Americans and Europeans Citizens still have doubt regarding this theme. Brazilians Citizens have not!"
3,4-string quartet just doesn't cut it,"This was a good idea but a 4-string quartet just doesn't sound right doing R.E.M. Note, it's not an orchestra and it sounds choppy.Just listen to the previews first, I didn't."
5,Lock Laces,"These stand up better than other types of elastic shoelaces. Once set, the lock does not slip and the shoes fit the same way always."
2,Difficult to attach to boots,"Too difficult to attach to my shoes...I prefer to tie my laces, even though I may have to do it more than once."
5,funny bone laughter,"If you want to laugh and laugh hard this is the DVD to purchase, also this DVD will bring back memories of the late 70s when Tv comedy was at it's best.i give this DVD a 2+ thumbs up. Looking 2 purchase season 2 soon!!.."
4,Laugh Away With the family!,Three's a Company is another great Sitcom Starring John Ritter and his Zany castWhere john Ritter has Followed Dick van Dyke's Foot step's in tripping over thingsGreat Show with alot of Laughter for the whole family..
5,first season of Three Company,Loved Three's Company when I used to watch it on TV Land so I had to get the first season. Would love to eventually get all the seasons of it. It is a great comedy show not like the so called comedy today that I personally think should be called sick or dark comedy.
3,Three's company nostalgia,I used to be a big fan. Somehow the first season wasn't what I remembered. Still John Ritter saved it all. I still am buying season 2.
4,o.k.,It's great to finally have this sitcom on DVD even if it's the first season only. The only bad thing about it is that it has as a bonus the teaser of letting you know that season 2 is coming next spring 2004 and at first I thought as a bonus surprise it actually included the 2nd season!I think this should've been released on a more complete package but oh well....nothing's perfect.
5,great comedy.,"Another funny sitcom of the 70's it's still unbelievable that John Ritter a great and funny actor is gone, order the entire series it will crack you up."
5,great item,we LOVE the classic tv series. this was one of the best. can't wait to buy the rest of the seasons.
5,This is one of the best seasons.,"I love Three's Company, always have, always will! The first season is one of my favorite seasons and I love all the episodes but especially the episodes where Chrissie and Janet first meet Jack and the episode where Chrissie's conservative mother comes for a visit and she worries that her mother will be upset that one of her roommates is a man and that her mother will get the wrong idea about the living conditions. This season may be short with only having 6 episodes but it's still worth buying because the episodes are funny and Amazon is offering it at a great low price!"
4,Teaser,"I am a big fan of the classic ""Three's Company"" series. Therefore, I would be hard pressed to say anything negative about the show. However, this DVD is a teaser to die-hard fans by getting you started on an affordable collection, yet limiting your viewing experience. With only six (6) episodes, you find yourself quickly disappointed with the amount of content. Apparently the next DVD (Season 2), due out in May, 2004, is more realistic in the amount of content and what a fan can more likely expect to pay for a full season's worth of episodes. Thumbs up to the actual content; thumbs down on the amount of content."
5,A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1,"I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing."
2,"Show=Amazing , DVD=RUSHED","One of my favorite shows ever, the DVD itself was rushed to capitalize on John Ritter's death. This is what I hate about movie studios, it's all about the money and not about quality. Thumbs down to the transfer, thumbs down to the menus, thumbs down to the speed of menu access.Remember, I'm not rating the show because it would get 10 stars. The transfer is garbage.John you are the man. Sorry about this quality!"
2,A lesson to be learned,I thought that because the DVD stated Season One that I was getting the entire season one. Much to my surprise it only included six episodes. I now know that unless it states COMPLETE season it isn't. I was quite disappointed and feel that the advertising is misleading.
1,JACK THE IDJIT,I think Three's Company is the WORST sitcom there EVER was on telivision. Bad writing BAD acting and JUST PLAIN BAD all the way around. The horrible thing was it was SO bad you sometimes felt compelled to watch it in spite of your better judgement. PAINFULLY stupid plots.
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!",I love this show!!! Ritter was a comedic genius as far as I am concerned. Everyone of the episodes on this disc is a real hoot for anyone that grew up watching reruns of the show. Give it a whirl and you won't be sorry. R.I.P John Ritter...We'll miss you.
5,How Much Better Can This Get!,"I'm so glad this show is finally coming out on dvd. I've been waiting for it ever since MASH came out on dvd. Mash and Three's Company have always been my all time favorite shows and i'm only 20 years old. You can't get much better in John Ritter's physical comedy in Three's Company. He's probably the greatest actor/comedian to ever walk the face of this earth. And to hear of his passing tore a whole in my heart. I never got to meet the guy, but his tv performances helped me to generate a many a laught and I can't wait till i can get my hands on this dvd. It's a safe bet i'm gonna wear this dvd set out quickly as i did MASH. RIP Mr. John Ritter, but your awesome legacy will live on in my dvd player for years to come."
2,Spanish,In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Not subtitules in spanish.Mal mal mal. But Is very funny.
5,Delighfully Entertaining,I've watched all the episodes a dozen times and I never get tired of watching these three. This show is definitely the best. I forget my worries and relieves me of the stress that everyone go through in their daily lives.
5,"jack, janet, and chrissy","The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls, who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter."
3,OK for the price I guess,"Bought 2 of these to replace mats I purchased 20 years ago at Pier One. My old ones were of a higher quality material, and were thicker. I don't expect these to last anywhere near 20 years, but for the price, I can't complain. On the upside, they are thinner and lighter, so easier to fit in the backpack, and less weight to carry."
1,Great idea - shoddy construction - waste of money,"I purchased this as a replacement for an old roll up tatami mat that I purhased at least twenty years ago. These are perfect for taking to the beach but couldn't find them local now. The tatami is woven tightly so that it keeps the sand off. Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11"" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."
2,Not of good quality!,"In the picture it seems bright, cool, So I ordered! I received it few days back.. not good looking, not of good quality!!"
5,"hilarious, thought provoking, very aware of todays society","What a shame this book is no longer in print! I adore this book to its core. What a beautiful story.The text on the back said it was a hilarious comedy about god and the devil returning to earth to see what happened to creation, but as a matter of fact it is so much more. It is about society, it is about humanity, it is about downfall. And yes, it is extremely witty.I am so glad I found it at the shelves of my favorite second hand book shopping place. I do hope it will get back into print, so more people can enjoy this awesome tale."
1,did not warm up to the book,"the book came highly recommended, but it didnt humor me and I couldnt warm up to the authors style of writing. bored me too...sadly gave up half way into it."
2,if you are buying cuz of Pearl Jam don't...,"The Ramones meet AC/DC. A live record with the song covered by Pearl Jam. Not a great recording. The songs are good, would rather hear studio versions. If you are looking to buy cause of the Pearl Jam song.. don't waste your money. Otherwise they are a good band but the production is no good!"
1,"Nasty book, nasty woman","From a woman who sold out her body ages ago and now attempts to be a partisan hack, and poorly at that. Why anyone would want to wipe their feet on this dirty carpet is beyond me. Not worth the time it took to phone in sex."
4,Land of the Dead soundtrack,"Here you have a perfect example of soundtrack. The music perfectly accompanies images and it intensifies them and it gives depth them. Aid to raise climax in horror scenes and aid to relax in dialogue scenes. The style is very powerful, very advisable for the postapocaliptic look of the movie. In spite of it, globally it is not as close as the soundtracks of the dawn of dead and the day of the dead."
3,Update to my previous review regarding motor noise.,"The high pitched motor noise is present in recordings, not only in very quiet situations (as my prvious review indicated, based on CanonDV site), but is also present when the camera is placed in front of speakers playing music.The above info is based on my playing two sample sound clips posted in a review at dvspot website by Jeff Keller.The persistant motor whine was VERY irritating and definately unacceptable.Since I love everything else about the ZR45/ZR50, I am now debating whether to buy it with the Canon DM-50 external mic for my upcoming vacation, or to wait until Spring/Summer 2003 and see if Canon fixes this problem in an upgraded model.Decisions, decisions, decisions!"
4,WOW,"Wow, was my first word when I opened it up. It is so small. I have not had a chance to explore all its functions yet, but so far it works great and gives high quality video. The picture function is also a great plus. This camcorder is well priced for what it offers"
4,great beginner cam,"one thing to watch out for,when using the zoom button,dont just let it go after you zoom,or it will click and the noise will be recorded. however,if you edit and can dub different audio then it wont matter. that said, we love the camera.ive been thinking about an off board mic for sterio audio,,just for fun. but since this camera is kinda old now,finding extra parts is kinda tough. when we bought it,they were just comming out and then everything was available,but now,several years later,,, well they arent. ebay or maybe canon outlet in the usa.in fact i just bid on a remote for it,we lost the other one. man,they come in handy.id probly also want a clear over lense to protect the main lense from grit and crud. cheaper to get a new cover than new lense."
1,Another nightmare about the remove cassette message,"I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk."
1,I liked it at first,"It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message. But you couldn't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything. I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera. And I was allowed to get a different brand, so I went with a Sony Handycam."
1,BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!!,"I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it."
4,Nice little camcorder,"I have read a lot of reviews and concluded that I'll give this camcroder a try. I was not really afraid of the motor whining but on the low-light performance much really. Anyway after I bought I did a couple of trial shootage in various lighting conditions and I was satisfied. After it got dark i did a trial under low-light in-house and it was satisfying to me. Because the shutter speed slows you do not have the luxury of moving the camcorder fast but this is a fact of optics not a camcorder flaw or anything. Motor whining is a problem but not a big deal really. If it is buy a mic. With the size of the cam, price i don't think this would be major problem. This is my humble opinion."
1,Horrible...,"I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one."
1,"Nice camera, when it works","I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera."
1,She can't sing!,"This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec)."
1,"hollow, lame and prescindible...","I bought this album in the hope of finding some kind of chic, interesting tunes ""a la French"", to match with her voice that I remembered from the past, but there's absolutelly nothing interesting inside: some elevator's music that won't disturb you in any given context. Utterly prescindible..."
3,How could one go wrong?,"3.5 Stars - Yes, this album is undoubtedly enjoyable and there are some amazing tracks (The Operation, AF607105, Little Monsters, Set Yourself On Fire, 5:55, and in that particular order). However, how could you not make a good album with Air composing your music? Those guys are good. That being said, even with Cocker, Hannon, and Air on board, this album is good but not great. Air's Talkie Walkie is superior to this."
4,A good review of the facts ...,"It is a catechism ... what more to say? It does the job, presents the facts and gives a lot of information in concise form that can be used for further study. What it is not is a prayer book, philosophical discussion or flowery inspirational work. It is a catechism."
3,Not enought info for me,"I think I expected bit more from this. It was okayon the history of the Buddha, jjust didn't give me all the information I expected."
3,It answers some questions I had,This book answers some questions that I had. If you are curious about Buddhism you may be interested in securing a copy for yourself.
4,The Buddhist Catechism,A simplistic way to garner a better understanding of the Buddhist way of life and for the beginner to grasp the journey that lays ahead of them.
2,Not for novices,Not very useful. Perhaps too high a level for a layman like me. Seems to be written for a serious student of Buddism.
3,interesting,This was a interesting read. Will have to read other buddhist books to compare and see if these are true. This downloaded really fast.
3,"Dud, in my opinion.","It just didn't pull me in, as the read I was looking for would not be soo dry. Not for the casual read..."
4,if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must book,from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.
3,Buddhist Catechism,"It mostly contains information that I have learned. From ther books. The format I'd different, it is written in an all question/answer form which I fin interesting."
5,A great and useful tool!,"I bought this book on a whim because I had just found my interest in photography, and I was done reading it two days later! Garrett makes all the concepts of photography understandable to those without any prior knowledge! I even found myself going through the book again and jotting down notes about film speeds and filters for easy reference later! I cannot wait to try out the things I have learned from this wonderful book! I only wish I had more to read! I recommed this for anyone who thinks he would not be able to understand the concepts of photography and the camera. This book is not written on a technical level so make this the first photography book you buy!"
4,"great book, good service","The book arrived in a little more time than I expected, but it was within the time frame indicated. However, I am happy with the book's condition. It's better that described. Great book and price."
4,Good Overall Book,"I just took a photography course and this book was one of the ones recommended. It is a little shallow, but covers all the basics and all the items covered in the class. It covers all the various topis from portrait to building photog as well as types of cameras, etc. If you want a basic book, this is the one to get. However, if you are looking for a lot of depth, keep looking. Then again, it is ""Keep it Simple"" so it delivers just what it says."
2,It's too simple even for a KISS book,"I know the whole point of ""dummie"" and ""KISS"" books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simple--too basic. I read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse. If I hadn't gotten this book for a steal I would have been very upset at my waste of money. There was just no real information. What a waste."
2,"outdated!!! although several book been out there for a long time, this book is also basic","I bought this book two months ago... It's outdated.It might include the information you are looking for, but at a very basic level. I went with the ""Undestanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson, and with ""The Digital Photography"". Both have outstanding reviews... and these will do the trick teaching you what you need to know to take great/almost pro photos..."
2,Mixed Bag,"This compilation contains some of the best jazz guitar ever in songs like Scotland I, the Jam with Albert and Yin. Unfortunately it also digs up silly tripe like Eyes of Love, Planet End, Adam Smasher and Rene's Theme. The shorter compilation, the Essential Larry Coryell is less expensive, more consistent and manifestly superior to this double CD."
2,Belkin poser,"Ordered a Belkin, got something unknown. Part number on unit (BI13-120100-AdU) doesn't match the advertised one. What's up with that? $11 is too much for a knock off brand."
3,Not one of his best,"I expected so much from Townsend after reading a few of his other stories. However, there is less bdsm content than I expected and more political/social commentary. Not a bad thing if one is more aware of the politics and social environment of the gay community in the 1970s but hard to follow and identify with otherwise. I had difficulty empathizing with any of the characters -- perhaps part of that lies with the fact that there are so many characters in the story. However, there are several hot scenes in the book and therefore it may be worth the time and money to purchase the book."
5,"Definately ""NOT"" more of the same","Larry with great ""4"" piece horn section.Much, much different than the Larry Carlton/Steve lukather DVD, which is great.Who doesn't love a good horn section: Mark Douthit/T sax; Doug Moffet/Baritone; Mike Haynes/trumpet; Barry Green TromboneKeyboardist/Rick Jackson/phenomenal(same as Carlton/Lukather DVD), Moyes Lucas/drums/exceptional and none other than Travis Carlton/Bass/tight.Songs:Friday Night ShuffleNight SweatsJosieSapphire BluesMinute by MinuteJust an excuse7 for yaTenor MadnessSlightly DirtyDeep into itRoom 335sleepwalkextrasThis is great, but do NOT miss the new Larry and Tak DVD. That thing is just way too much. Phenomenal.No, I am not a Larry Carlton freak/affectionado/wierdo. I just love great concert DVDs."
5,A must for membership staff!,"Excellent resource. Covers all the issues revolving around membership programs. Lots of specifics, examples and ideas;for membership staff, boards, and executives. Fills a major need for specific ways to carryout and improve membership programs. Great to have input from experts on a subject that so many non-profits grabble with everyday. Covers such essential membership topics as planning, membership and fund-raising, getting and keeping members, volunteers, the internet. Also helpful examples:of worksheets, budgets, and helpful case studies, plus software information.Truly ""an action plan for results."" Recommended highly."
2,Not As Engaging As I Had Hoped,"I'm not a huge dance/techno/electronica/call-it-what-you-want fan, but I do dabble. And seeing the addition of vocals, bass and guitars to a dance outfit piqued my interest. Unfortunately, it didn't hold it. Nothing really bad here, it just didn't make much impression. ""Drop the Break"" is OK, and I liked the trance-y feel of ""Yallah Habibe"". The only other impression I got was the rather silly lyrics on ""Abduction"". Serviceable for background music, but not really an album I could get into."
5,some groovy beats,"This is really good stuff. Strong uplifting beats with some serious funk thrown in, sketches of twisting melodies, beautiful airy vocal overtones. It's a lasting favorite that still hits all my get-up-and-groove reflexes."
1,Not as good as Counterfeit CD...,To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.
1,Reaaally sucks!!!,"The only song that's worth listening to on this album is ""Break in"" and it can be found on Superstar DJ Keoki's ""Transatlantic move"". Go for his album instead..."
3,Honest and fearless,"An honest and fearless look inside herself. Barbara Gordon fights her addiction and wins. She doesn't blame other people for her problems, and she doesn't gloss over embarrassing parts.One jarring note: she's got both a trust fund and a rent-controlled apartment."
4,Great Read,"Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads."
3,A second edition from a long time ago?,"I remember reading this book a very long time ago. I'm confused as I found this written alongside her biography on the book description page: ""Her first book, I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can, was translated into nine languages, became an international bestseller, and received a nomination as finalist for outstanding autobiography by the American Book Awards."" And when I say a very long time ago, I'm thinking it was maybe in the 70's.I don't understand what is going on. Is this a reprint of the same book?I think it is presented as a new book, in which case it is terribly misleading. BUT, I may be wrong and perhaps I just missed something. Anyone else confused? Or anyone else know what's going on? It sure has gotten a lot of good reviews, it looks like. So, maybe if it is being published again it needed to happen."
4,Very good heart wrenching story,I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent.
4,I Dancing as fast as I can,"Interesting read. Mental illness is a common illness that often goes ignored until families are destroyed, job lost, etc. This was a true story of how someone has reached their goal in life and struggled with mental illness. Excellent writing."
2,Review of book,"I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
4,good book,"this was a very good story and held my attention. I was a little disappointed by the ending, I wish it would have given a little more follow up on her life."
1,Needy,"She seemed to be ""ill"" when it was convenient for her. All I kept thinking about was how she should have thanked her lucky stars that she and her family could afford all that treatment.I really kind of wanted to smack her and say Snap out of it!"
3,A Little Dated,"I received my copy from Goodreads first-reads program. It is a memoir of addiction, treatment, and recovery. At times, it was a fascinating story and at other times, very difficult to get into. Given the story takes place in the 1970's, much of the treatment information is dated, and the afterward should have been updated as this could have been a very powerful addition to the new edition."
3,now i see...,it's a good eye opener. at least it's good enough to make me think twice before following instructions... from anyone at all.
2,dry,This book was really dry... there were a couple interesting moments but most of the book was a lot of unnecessary words. This is one of the very few books that I didn't finish!
1,Out of date: fading fast,"When written, this books topic was well known. Individuals and styles of communication were well understood.With time, the people and places Con Price refers to are only familiar to a few local individuals-and only important in regards to this fund of knowledge.I am currently working with Dr. William Thackery of MSU-Northern, Havre, Montana to upgrade and update the book and subscript the text for improved reading, relevance, and accuracy. Once done this text may be a leading contribution to the history of Montana and Southern Alberta.Yours,Ruth M. Burleigh P.O.Box 608 Chinook, Montana 59523 (406)357-4255"
1,VERY limited lifespan,"I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use, it was totally shot. Either the keys didn't respond at all or if you pressed one key, multiple letters appeared (""a"" became ""as""; ""q"" became ""qw"") and it was impossible to return. One friend who also purchased it had exactly the same problem within a month, so it wasn't just a bad unit.If I coud give it NO stars, I would."
3,Good if you're not looking for something to use all the time,"I bought this as a gift. It was useful, and the fact that it was waterproof is handy. The keys are a little hard to get used to, and it's rather cheaply made."
4,"Prozac, Valium & Ritalin...breakfast of champions.","With dialogue like that, how can you NOT take to this movie. Crisp, cool dialogue, a minimal plot, 100% action and performances from Halsey and Lambert taking the honours. The violence is bloodless, though brutal (perhaps budgetary restraints prevented Mr Pyun from spending on blood squibs...reminded me of Miami Vice...gunplay, but no blood). I'd love to see this one re-made with John woo directing. Bloodless violence aside (which takes the edge off the movie) the only thing that lets the DVD down is that the congenital cretins at Tri-Mark have seen fit in their infinite wisdom to present it as a Full Frame picture rather than the 2.35:1 aspect ratio it should have been. The picture quality of the disc suffers abominably when zoomed to full frame, and the action becomes confusing, the cropping at the sides being blatantly obvuious. Come on TriMark, let's have a Widescreen re-release of this one. One of Pyun's better efforts, on a par with Nemesis."
2,Dumb Guns...but great soundtrack,"Christopher Lambert and Ice-T are supposed to be the stars here, but what little depth this movie has comes from Michael Halsey, who turns a professional killer into a sympathetic figure (and that ANYONE can earn any sympathy in this bit of video treacle is itself an achievement).If you're not a big fan of bloodless, mindless gunplay, the only reason to buy this movie is for the soundtrack. Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental."
2,In a Nutshell: Mambo Murder,"I've now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in."
4,entertaining action movie SPOILERS,the main reason why i waited up until 2 in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t.Great action AND I WAS DISSAPIONTED when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes 50 mabye she is.So it was very entaining worth a watch.
1,Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched."
2,OK if you have an unlimited budget and dream,"Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the ""Dream"" shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average ""Joe"" would spend decades purchasing. Not too much ""practical"" information about ""The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop"". Definately a dream."
5,one more positive note,"Don't know if anyone else has addresed this. I have been building my barn shop for 7 years now. The book covers many of my thoughts and concerns. Would have wanted this sooner than later. Points raised for consideration. Noise and sound. I put in some wood walls, painted white and sealed against moisture, but I fussed with that or drywall. I considered my own sound issues and went with wood. But after reading some of the author's comments I will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when I do other parts of the shop. Not for me alone, but for my nieghbors as well. Good book to read before, during or contemplating a shop. Hey, we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well."
3,Practical advise for setting up a woodworking shop,"I found this to be one of the better books I've seen about setting up shop. It showcases plenty of example shops and has some handy advise. However, like most books on this topic, it tries to cover all the possibilites - building a separate shop, working in a shed, basement, attic etc. and pertinent information for any one case is thus sparse. I'd like to see books specifically for conversion of a basement space or shed etc. into a shop, but I guess that would only add limitations on readership from a writer/publisher perspective."
5,What a great resource!,"As a library administrator, and avid woodworker, I get to see and read a lot of woodworking and shop building books. This is among the best I have ever read. I even purchased a copy of this one for myself. I was really impressed with all of the common-sense advice for day-to-day problems encountered in any workshop. Many of the other workshop books on the market are either too simplistic, or serve only to showcase famous woodworking shops without detail. This book gives all the nitty-gritty that you will need to set up or rework your dream shop. It definitely helped me."
1,weak advice,"The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made."
4,Great WineTour,"We had a great time watching this virtual tour of Chile and it's wine regions. The DVD is narrated in English, gives you good tips and interesting information of the history and how the wine industry has develop in Chile."
4,Nearly Sanders Best,"It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."
1,He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!,"This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch."
5,The credible source for authentic ninjutsu.,"There is no way anyone can truly say that they study or train ninjutsu without reading Stephen Hayes' material. He is probably the only reason that ninjutsu is accessable to the masses. His work and dedication to the art without being a fringe kook or a wacko give him the highest level of credibility. This is good stuff. His master, Masaaki Hatsumi is still alive and in Japan. There are no secrets--just verifiable truth waiting to be discovered. If you want your knowledge of ninjutsu/ninjitsu/ninpo etc. to be complete, you will buy his books."
5,Mad Max special edition,This is the ultimate action movie and still after more than 20 years I really enjoy watching the film again. Max has to fight crazy motorbikers with his supercharger V8 car in the futuristic landscape. He give no mercy to the bad boys after they have killed of his family.
5,Finally the Australian version.,"I first saw this movie in the theatre in 1980 or 81. I have purchased the VHS version and the DVD version as soon as they came out. Since then I have been searching for the Australian soundtrack version but to no avail. When I read on a Mad Max website that the Australian version was available, I bought it immediately. Man was I blown away. This was one of my favorite movies. Now it is my favorite! How they could have released this movie with the overdub is insane. It's like watching a brand new movie. Definitely worth the price of admission. Oh and there is no comparison between this movie and it's sequels. Road Warrior was okay but Thunderdome was a joke.Turkey."
2,Cult classic...,"There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either."
4,I LIKE TURTLES,I LIKE TURTLES. And Mad Max. Excellent movie. I like very much. I love him. And the bad guy was good in Farscape.
4,Cheap but satisfying,"""Mad Max"" was made on a low budget ($50K to $100K according to various sources); the dubbing and some of the editing do make the film seem cheap at times, but the photography and music are of big-budget quality. The chases provide lots of thrills (wait'll you see that trailer burst!). Director George Miller provides some brilliant imagery (Max's feverish search for the last of the bikers is a most unforgettable set-piece)."
3,Great early Mel Gibson! Disappointing DVD features!,"This is an excellent example of Mel Gibson's fine acting work. If you haven't seen it, but have seen Beyond Thunderdome, give it a viewing. Unfortunatly I purchased the DVD version which was released in 1998. It doesn't have any special features at all. You are also stuck with the American voices dubbed over the Austrailian actor's. This can be quite funny in itself but I wish I had the option to see both the original Aussie tape and the Americanized version on one disk."
2,Warning - badly dubbed dvd,"Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version where American actors replace the Australian actors on the soundtrack. I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only rate the dvd 2 stars."
1,Criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound,"Don't buy this Video. With DVD technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks, the original Aussie version and the rotten American dubbed version. These dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants. Perhaps if nobody buys it they'll get a clue."
3,"Oddly enough, the worst in the trilogy.","I'm really not sure why, but this is my least favorite in the Mad Max trilogy. It's not nearly as awesome as the Road Warrior or fun as Beyond Thunderdome. Either way, it's worth watching simply because it sets the scene for Road Warrior, one of the greatest movies of all time."
4,Mad Max (1979),"A catalyst in the Contemporary Era revenge-actioner movement, this George Miller flick features a young, then-unknown Mel Gibson in only his second movie role, as top-cop Max Rockatansky. After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, this film, made for a meager $400,000, held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999, when Blair Witch surpassed its mark."
2,Dubbed into American English,"This DVD is the U.S. release, in which the original Australian dialog (including Mel Gibson's) was replaced with dubbed dialog in ""American English""."
3,"Watch ""The Road Warrior"" first!","This film is the prequel to the amazingly good ""The Road Warrior"". I've read that ""Mad Max"" has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make, $100M in revenue generated); however, upon watching this movie, you will immediately be struck by its very low budget look and feel. If you've already watched ""The Road Warrior"", you may want to watch this one to see where RW has its roots, but you really need to watch RW first. Leonard Maltin (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is crazy. MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K, but RW is a GREAT MOVIE, period. One more thing, this film is dubbed with American voices because someone, in their infinite wisdom, thought Americans wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents. This was a big mistake, as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing."
2,Blah,"I thought this movie was boring and it didn't let you get to know any of the characters. The only good thing in this movie is a young, cute Mel Gibson."
3,worst of the three,Normally I would say the first in a trilogy is the bestbut Mad Max is an exception.In fact Mad Max I think is the worst of the three.The Road Warrior is a much better movie.
4,Often imitated never duplicated.,"This film set the standard for Post apocalyptic violence... Almost along the line of Kubric's Clockwork Orange. The movie is unforgettable and launched Mel Gibson into the lime light. With a low budget they managed to come up with a very unique movie that was captivating and horrific. Many tried to cash in on copying this movie, but failed to capture its orignal spirit... The Road Warrior was a decent sequel with a much higher budget... It would recieve 5 stars, but the middle section of the movie is a bit sappy... and dubbing over the Australian accents was a mistake."
4,THIS MOVIE IS TOTALLY MAD,"After watching Mad Max I didn't really know what to say,I mean the acting was pretty bad,but the action was great,there wasn't really that much of a plot but it had good characters who tried to describe the plot.It was cool to see Mel Gibson in his first staring role.This movie's fun."
4,MUST HAVE this edition original AUSSIE,MAD MAX the special edition is a must have for 1 reason:THE ORIGINAL AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE SOUNDTRACK. They should have released the movie with the original language NOT the English dubbed.
3,Good Film,"I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars. The Road Warrior (part 2), is much better. I am an auto-mechanic and a car buff, so I particulary love the car scenes in this movie, especially Max's black Ford Falcon Interceptor. Even though the blower on the engine is fake, you still love the car and how Max wipes out the motorcycle gang with it. This is a good movie, but make sure you get the original version, where all the voices aren't dubbed over."
5,Cult Classic,"In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today."
3,disappointed,Like Mel Gibson and I like this movie but I didn't see the big changes I expected. Maybe I missed something. It happens.
4,The best of the Mad Max triolgy,"The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star."
1,Mad Mel,"I wouldn't waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in.This guy is a complete and utter psychopath!"
1,Don't buy this version it is DUBBED for the America Market,"It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version."
1,Not worth buying!,"I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it's hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original movie!!!Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic movie (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the movie is!!!"
4,"Gives you a nice urban 'western' type film - Mel , not Clint","This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call .This is a classic and I suppose there are some who would call it a cult film , but it is full of intense performances and whilst not science fiction , it does have an otherwordly quality to it .Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness .If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .Buy and enjoy this distinctive film on DVD , with a healthy and worthwhile dose of extras ."
4,Good revenge-type movie,"If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. This movie was a really good revenge movie. The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said. It is done in ""Australian language"" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson's character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said. Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made. I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue. But, it is a movie well worth viewing."
3,"Great movie, but unsatisfaying edition","This movie is almost a classic, so it deserved a moro complete edition with a second disk full of extras."
3,What a strange movie...,It is supposed to be a post apocalypses story but was really only about what things were like on the roads. Very narrow story line. In the end it is like all Mel Gibson movies based on revenge. Boooorrrring!!!!
4,Get this edition for the superior Aussie version.,"Anyone intelligent enough to ""get"" this movie is capable of understanding the Austrailian version. We have moved beyond the need for Americanizing films, which tend to water-down the original intent and flavor of the director/creators vision. This movie, for me, is more relevent today than it was when it was filmed. In this part of America, especially in small town rural areas, you can almost get the feeling that we are living in this future. Many people in the midwest scrounge and save their meager earnings to be able to afford to fill their gas tanks just so they can drive to their jobsite. The desolation of the area in which the movie was filmed makes this movie eerily believable and I often am reminded of the look and feel of the film when driving through some small midwest American ""ghost-towns"". In spite of the realism this motion picture is still high escapism, which for me is the point of watching movies. I'll watch this one over and over."
3,Has It's Good Moments,"Mad Max wasn't a bad movie. It really is a lot better than the third installment in the trilogy. Not a classic like ""The Road Warrior,"" but it still holds it's own. It's quite different than the other two. You get to see how Max was before he lost everything, and how he became the way he was later on. Not bad."
4,Buy the Special Edition,"I saw this movie when i was a kid and loved it. I still like it as an adult, but the dubbed dialogue takes alot away from it. Hearing the original Aussie accents take this to a new dimension. Very Cool!"
4,This DVD ain't bad,"Yeah, I'm gonna post here to contrast what others have said. This dvd does include the original Aussie soundtrack, the first time Americans have ever seen this version in the history of the film. Pretty impressive. It is much better than the dubbed version. The special features are so-so, not a whole lot to rave about. The print is clean, it looks great with the widescreen, and the original audio is a definite plus. This is certainly a worthy purchase for being only ten dollars."
5,The first the better !,"A true action movie with Mel Gibson as "" vigilante "" after the death of his wife and son by mad bikers : truly a masterpiece !"
1,Red only when off.,"I replaced the amber bulbs of the turn signals with these ones. My car has clear lenses and unfortunately these bulbs are so bright that they look reddish, like washed off, they don't have enough red coating to look RED.I was looking for something to look the same color as the stop lights, these bulbs don't do it."
1,Barely red enough,"Sold as red, obviously.But I find them to be more pink than dark red. I'm sure they're still legal (or hope they are), but not the look I was hoping for / expecting.Otherwise, they work fine."
2,The sword in the sux,Well iu thin that this book should've had a first book. Its very confusing and boring its so long I did not like it !!!!!!!!!!!
1,The childhood of a legendary king,"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+."
5,One of the greatest Arthur tales ever.,"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."
3,Ok but not great,"This is an interesting little book. I read it as part of my children's literature course back in 1999. The book is partially Arthurian Legend, part social commentary and part farce.I did not like the inappropriate references for the time of the story, trains, buses ... As well I didn't appreciate the mixing of Robin Hood (Wood) in the 12th Century with Arthur of the 6th Century.Yet all in all it was a fun book - easy to read."
3,RING,"THE RING IS BEAUTIFUL BUT THIN, FOR SPECIAL OCCASSIONS ONLY. I LEFT IT IN MY PURSE AND IT GOT PANCAKED BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO WEAR IT. I WAS ABLE TO FIX IT AS MUCH AS I COULD BUT THE SHAPE IS DISTORTED. VERY NICE OTHERWISE. ALSO IT RUNS A LITTLE SMALL, I WEAR A LOOSE 7 AND THIS RING IS SNUG"
4,fairies dancing on my head,I found this cd on the shelf at my work. I'm listening to it right now. Sweet instrumentals that make me want to dance around. It reminds me of sugarplum fairies creating music in the 70's. The sound is light. The lyrics are few but this album isn't about the lyrics. It's about the rhythm it creates. It's a pleasant album.
4,Worth the effort it might take,"Ever have one of those albums?An album where you spin it a few times and a few songs might sink-in, but the majority seem wrapped in gauze? Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. ""Captain Easychord""), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it's worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found ""Margerine Eclipse"" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for ""Dots & Loops"" and ""Cobra & Phases"" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens."
2,Not their best outting,"I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday"
3,Half a Great Album,"I wanted to love this album. Really. From the opening notes of ""Black Ants in Sound Dust,"" I appreciated its cleverness. 7/8 time! Whole-tone scale! Bells! Cool! ""Spacemoth"" too excited my aural taste buds, even if the entire second half is a total ripoff of the Velvet Underground's ""Sunday Morning."" By ""Captain Easychord,"" however, the album was beginning to tire me, and not even a section that sounded like it could have come from Megaman 3 made my ears tingle. Only ""Hallucinex"" is worthy of infinite replay value, in my opinion. Each song on this album sounds great by itself, but all together, this album bores me."
4,Another great Hoover book,"I deeply enjoyed the other Hoover novels available for Kindle, ""The Moghul"" and ""Carribee"". This offering, ""The Samurai Strategy"", suffers a little in comparison. Unlike other Hoover works, this effort was written and set in the late 80s-early 90s. The dated setting slightly detracts from the book in today's world. The subject matter still holds up very well in the aftermath of Wall St's latest shennagans, but some readers might get lost in the thick financial terminology. Well written and edited, this is a good book to spark thought on America's current financial and industrial situation."
2,disappointing,"Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world. The only thing missing from this ""B"" grade movie plot are black and white hats to differentiate the bad guys from the good guys. Not at all what I had hoped for."
4,Well worth a read,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this well written, absorbing, researched story of international financial espionage and the potential opportunities that a base-less currency and the global financial world offered by the internet."
4,A simple wish,"Well, everyone, this movie was pretty good! There was some hysterical moments-like when Murray is trying to turn the mean guy into a rabbit and instead turns him into a rabbi! Or when the bad fairy (played by Kathleen Turner) turns the head fairy paper-thin and stuffs her mouth with bricks. However, I think that Mara Wilson has been in better movies. Also, if you are gullible, do not watch this movie. Some parts are very believable, but some parts are totally unrealistic! But it's really good."
2,Family film,"I did not really care for this film, though, it did have a few funny moments, a lot of the attempts at humor fell flat for me. I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Funny,"This movie has the little girl from Matilda and Martin Short. Good family picture , we loved it. Came in excellent condition!"
3,A Simple Wish for a Simple Mind,My children had seen this movie several years ago and remembered liking it. We purchased it and were surpirsed at how lame it was. Perhaps it was made for small children because older kids and adults will find the acting bad and the story too silly to enjoy.
3,A ironic fairytale,"Mara Wilson is back from playing her chartacters in Mrs. Doubtfire and has turned into a fairy godmother believer! When, ironicly she gets a boy fairy godmother (played by Martin Short). She needs a wish, her dad has been wanting to be in a show all his life and he has had an audition! All his daughter needs to do now is wish, wish, wish on it and maybe maybe it will come true. Are you a believer? I actually bought this video and I was kind of disappointed in some bits. I still watch it regulary though, it is a funny and fun flick to watch."
3,It was fantastic!,It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life!There was so much magic in it really puts together a good movie.I just rented it and I've only seen it two times but I still think its the best movie I've ever seen in my life
3,"Interesting, quick read","While Harry Pidgeon's feat of sailing around the world is exceptional, and his writing style clear and concise, he offers few insights into sailing or his life. The book is fashioned after Joshua Slocum's ""Sailing Alone Around The World:"" Or equally as likely, Pidgeon and Slocum were two men of a like mind. In any event, both men portray that 19th century reserve so characteristic of the Englishmen. Such reserve in the face of near scrapes with death maybe admirable, but it does not make for as interesting reading."
4,Easy to hold rattle,"This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time."
3,133MHz SDRAM DIMM Desktop Memory (KVR133X64C3/128),It was good until it fried on me -_- I would recommend it tho but first check for Refunds and return with sellers it can Fry because it's used.
4,Mini Blinds something I always put off cleaning.,"With this tool you can keep your mini blinds really clean, the brush reaches into those impossible crevices. And I now dust my blinds on a regular basis to keep them looking really great. I was most pleased with this product, especially since it saves me those extra steps of cleaning!!"
1,Product did not work like I thought it would,"Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. That was not the case at all. It does not clean the dirt off your blinds the way you would think. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
3,Great shipper,"Duster was delivered quickly and in good condition. However, I ordered for my wood blinds and it doesn't fit properly."
3,One size does NOT fit all,"The mini blind cleaner comes with an attachment; implying use the adapter to fit every vacuum cleaner;it does not fit the Shark Lift-Away vacuum cleaner, but will fit others like an Electrolux."
5,Trout Does it Again!,"Like all of their CD's, Trout fishing in America has done it again! Fun, entertaining music that is great for adults, kids...whomever!Trout continues to be one of my favorite groups out there-- it's amazing that they do not get more national publicity."
4,Keith and Ezra get serious (mostly),"Keith and Ezra's most polished, mostly serious work for non-kids. Very well done with excellent new songs. My new favorite Trout CD. Hey, guys, just don't forget your roots and all the silliness that made us fans fall in love with you!"
4,Well Played Kid's Music,"Trout Fishing In America make kids music, they do it well, and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it, even with adults, although I highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it's own merits. If you need a CD for your kids to listen to that won't drive you crazy, you have found it, but otherwise this is probably not a CD you want to own."
1,everybody BUT Hendrix,"This video shows managers,roadies,and freinds, talking about THE MAN. NO complete songs even in the background (which is the only place the music is). If you want to see Hendrix play, it's not here."
2,Should be called a documentary!,I thought this would have more complete songs--like U2's Rattle and Hum or Styx's Return to Paradise. Instead it is a documentary with short clips of Jimi performing. Disappointing...
2,Who mixed this thing??,"I was really looking forward to this one. As a fan of the Classic Album Series, I was very disappointed when I watched this one. The volume level is very inconsistent, especially during the sections where people are talking over the music. You have to turn it way up when they're talking, then be quick with the remote when the music starts or it will blow your speakers! For die-hard fans only, and keep the volume remote handy. You'll need it!"
5,MAGIC,Great looking toy. I have Magic doing his no-look-pass pose towards my other Lakers greats. Good size and similar resemblance to the Magic man.
1,Highly disappointed,"I bought this to be a part of my daughter's train set, and have been nothing but disappointed. For starters, the red circular center piece can easily be removed, and I anticipate the day it comes up missing permanently. The wood is slightly bowed, and though it does not impede play, I was expecting a higher quality of toy (this is Brio after all). The most disappointing thing, though, was how small the turntable is. I knew it would not support the larger engines (e.g. Gordon and Henry), but I was surprised that even mid-sized engines such as Edward and James would not fit. I wish I had kept the box because I would love to return this item."
3,Not up to William Bayer's usual quality level,"Having read his two novels under the David Hunt nom de plume as well as The Dream of Broken Horses, I was really pumped to read Peregrine. After all, he won the Edgar for best novel when it came out.After finishing it, I don't know what the judges were thinking. The plot really isn't believable, the ending is predictable, and the characters move in ways that don't seem realistic.I liked the sense of place he conveys for mid town and upper Manhattan. I liked the intriguing details about bird hunting, and I really learned a lot there.However, the melodramatic plot did just not do it for me.I recommend you read the three books I listed above. They're all quite enjoyable."
2,disappointing,"I've read several Bayer novels and enjoyed them very much. After hearing that this novel won an Edgar award I was eager to read it. Well...that must have been a very thin year for Edgar nominees. This book was a severe letdown. Totally unbelievable and it got sillier and more ridiculous the more pages I read. Honestly, I can't believe Bayer would even want this one still in print. His other novels, and the ones he has written as David Hunt, are very good. But this one reads like the work of an amateur by comparison. Give it a miss."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"GOOD PRODUCTION, GREAT BEATS, ALRIGHT FLOW, AND HIS DELIVERY WAS OK TOO. BUT HIS TALENT AS A LYRICIST ISN'T WHERE I'D LIKE HIM TO BE. BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS OK"
1,"wow, what a mess","If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."
2,strange incomprehensible mess,"I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing ""Cities Of The Red Night"" I don't believe I ever will again! What a strange befuddling mess, I challenge *anyone* to be able to summarize the plot of this book for me in plain-sense English language and actually make sense. This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy. So despite the mass confusion of his prose, I'd say #'s 1 and 3 above are why I gave the book two stars instead of just one. Cheers!"
5,ORGASM OF THE WORD,"Burroughs searches in his writing for the same thing he searched for in drug use, sex and the russian roulette games he played with his guns: to try and distill out of an experience the pure essence of what it means to be alive, that single moment of ecstasy when living is made real in a blinding flash. Through graphic imagery of sex and death Burroughs will play you like a miscreant attacking a cathedral pipe organ, pulling out all the stops, feet pounding all the pedals at once, hands stomping the keys, blasting the pipes. In that rush of noise he challenges you to find the whisper of truth. A Liturgy and Scripture for the Damned."
4,Bad Boy Bill reaches his pertgee of philosophy,Misanthropic and challengingin this work Bourroughs sees mankind as sociopathic an mindlessly devising methofs of self-exterminationdifficul and difficult to put downyoull find that possible only to answer bodily demands for sustenance or eliminationENJOY
5,Gather in the Nets,"Burroughs drags in the nets he has held out for fifty years or so and sorts out the information he has gathered. In his most lucid, almost straight forward prose (inspired by Denton Welch), Burroughs puts forward a trilogy -Cities of the Red Night, Place of Dead Roads, and The Western Lands- with all his loves and hates, and serves them in his most favourite genres from childhood up: Pulp Dectective; Sci Fi; Pirates; High School Theatre; Egyptian; and others.Naked Lunch may have messed with you, but it never infiltrated your thinking as much as these books will. I think the deceptively simple language and 'sense' of 'narrative continuity' help to disarm and act as a Trogan Horse.If you are easily offended you may want to skip Burroughs altogether, though, in that case, I suspect you need him to unsettle your morals, just a little, so you can reflect on your position."
3,waiting,"have not read this book because,first one was ok not one i cant read later. Have many more i want t read."
5,Awesome!,This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read.
2,This book is good but I wouldn't call it great.,"I liked Rashel and Quinn, they really go together. It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house."
4,This book was really cool! I recommend this book highly!,"I think that Rashel is a strong female charactor. I think that her only flaw is that she tends to be hypocritical. I think that Quinn is a good soulmate choice for her. I really liked this book because it had a good plot and I liked that a vampire and vampire hunter got together. This was my favorite book out of the whole series. I recommend buying this book, or at least reading it, because it is very good!"
5,It was the best Night World book!,Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"Of all the books that L. J. has written in this series, ""The Chosen"" is by far the best. I have read all nine of the currently published books(and am still eagerly awaiting the tenth). This book has the wonderful premise of the previous and subsequent books. However, it also has main characters with more depth than many characters in other novels and realistic motives. Rashel and Quinn spend most of the book trying to ignore their feelings for eachother and trying to kill eachother. Both things are something that the other books really lack. Niether readily admit to bieng soulmates. The two characters fellings towards the members of Circle Daybreak coin the term ""damned Daybreakers.""All of these things and their depth of character contribute to make this a great book rather than a marginally good book as the other books in this series have been."
5,Dog rescue,I really loved this book. It made you laugh and made you sad. I wish I could have the courage to rescue dogs in the same manner as Randy Grim does. Truly inspiring stories.
5,Life as a dog,"A fascinating account of one man's crusade to rescue the stray dogs of St. Louis, this book gives us incredible insight into the issues surrounding the stray animal problem in this country. I learned more than I knew there was to know about feral dogs and their place in our society. But this book is not just about dogs - the lessons learned could just as easily be applied to the ""capture"" and ""saving"" of all the other strays found in our cities--including those lost & homeless children who have become so commonplace. The behaviors they exhibit are scarily similar to those described by Randy Grim in this book. A gripping tale and one which should be read by anyone interested in the plight of all the strays of the world."
5,truly beautiful,"Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time."
2,An odd coverage of an uninteresting event,The author points out that this series of crimes is of little importance and has largely been forgotten. It will remain so.
4,Exciting and readable history,"This was a very enjoyable history book, and certainly one of the best books I have every read on Florida history. Though it is filled with facts and dates, it is also full of stories that make colonial St. Augustine come alive. It was also helpful that each chapter is a little story of it's own which relates to the whole book, but can be read separately. Best of all, the Spanish Inquisition makes an appearance, and nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition."
1,AVOID !!!,"If you want to impress your friends with your new DVD player then (...) don't show them this film. It's a straight forward copy from a video tape that will have you reaching for the tracking button (if only) and the sound is not in sync with the picture. The acting is wooden and the plot is dire. If you are fool enough to buy this, don't come crying to me when you realise I'm right!"
5,Fantastic,"When my doctor gave me a choice between crutches or a walker, I chose walker. My uncle had one of these and offered me its use. I loved the ease of its smooth gliding wheels and especially the hand brake. I never felt like it was getting away from me. The compartment was handy for traveling around with a book, meds, etc. and doubled as a seat when I was tired and had to rest. I think this is the best walker on the market!"
4,Great Alaska singers,JoAnn and Monte are two of the best Alaska singers I have ever heard. Back in the early 80's we purchased some tapes from their show in Juneau and are sorry to find out that we can't get CD's now. It seems that nobody carries updated versions that are truly some of the best Alaska folk songs. I was thrilled to get this CD and wish I could find more.
2,Film fails to capture the magic,"The quality of filming is so poor, the beauty of the music and the singer are lost. I saw the ""30's version of this as a child, and I wish I could get that....this was a real disappointment. Munsel sings beautifully, but the film itself is boring, and the quality is poor. Unless you really, really love Munsel and the music, don't buy this film."
4,Waltz King,Strauss - The Great WaltzThis is truly a masterpiece reflecting upon the life and times of a remarkable composer. We are lucky today to have such talented orchestras who can reproduce Johanns' works with such expertise thus keeping his music alive in our modern times.There is no one illustration of Johanns' work on this DVD as none can be classed as being one better than the other!
2,Substandard Product,"Here is the timeline of this product:After first two plays, little wood pieces started chipping off;In about two weeks, the pictures started peeling off;In about one month, layered wood started falling apart.Will I still buy puzzle from this company? Maybe, no one else selling small puzzle set for toddlers. What choice do I have? But I do pray to God that somebody will be making a better product soon and drive Melissa & Doug out of business."
2,Poor quality for the money,"For the cost, this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work. Considering that the puzzle is made in China and probably cost next to nothing to produce, they could have spent a few minutes finishing the edges of the pieces and lacquering the image so that it is more durable."
5,Great Puzzle,This is an excellent puzzle for very young children. Melissa & Doug products are well made and kids love them. This puzzle is wooden so kids wont destroy it if they try to roughly put the pieces in. The design is adorable and makes a great gift for any young animal lover.
2,Wood chips off,The pieces of this puzzle are definitely no for kids..or even adults.Its made of poor quality wood and easily chips off.It chips off into such small pieces that can easily embed in anyone skin or even be eaten out of curiosity.Did not expect it from a M@D toy
5,Very pretty and good quality,My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it.
1,Not recommanded,"After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time."
3,nice pictures,"the colors are very vivid, the picture is very nice, I was a little disappointed in the quality of the wood but worth the price."
3,It's okay,"The pieces were cute but still stuck together. I made a huge mess taking them apart. The base also didn't have the puzzle piece shape outlined so it was hard for my 2yo to know where the pieces went. He can do the puzzle with our help, but he really just isn't interested in this one."
4,Very durable puzzle but not challenging enough for a 3 1/2 year old,"I bought this puzzle for my 3.5 year old daughter as she showed lots of interest in puzzles. This is a very nicely made toy, very durable and extremely helpful to have the wooden tray to put it together in. We haven't had any issue with pieces sticking together. My daughter loves this puzzle and takes it apart and puts it together a few times a day. She is able to put it together in amount a minute now.I'd recommend this as a skill level for under 3 years old.I'd also bought one of the 48 piece puzzles which seems at a better challenge level for 4-5 years old."
5,Really great shoes,"I love these shoes. I live in Dubai where it is currently hotter than you can imagine, yet I have 2 dogs that need daily walks. I wanted something that gave me comfort and support while walking but without the heat of socks and shoes. I bought these shoes last week and have worn them every day since. They are so supportive yet comfortable, I feel like i could run in them, yet I barely feel like I'm wearing anything! This was my first pair of Merrells - over the week I bought 2 more pairs :)"
3,not the best,"I bought 2 pair of these, one for me and one for my daughter. We were looking for light weight versatile shoes to travel around south east asia in. I really liked that the back strap was removable. The PROBLEM was that the back strap didn't want to stay on at all. the velcro kept coming undone all the time and i ended up just getting rid of them and buying cheap flip flops along the way. Same with my daughter's pair. very disappointing. Maybe these shoes would be alright if you never opened the velcro back to begin with, but then what's the point?"
1,This is high density module,This is high density module. It works only with a fewmainboards. It does not with the two I have.Amazon.com - please correct me if I am wrong.
1,memory problems,This Kingston memory isn't recognized by my computer which is only about a year and a half old. I went and used SimpleTech memory instead which works just fine. I would not recommend this product.
4,Kingston Technology KVR133X64C3 (Retail Package),"Got this item quickly and in good condition, installed it without trouble and it has worked flawlessly since the installation. Not much more you could hope for."
1,Didn't Work,"Despite being a PC133 slot, this chip didn't work with my computer... when I put it in, the computer wouldn't boot, when removed, it booted fine... Other RAM works fine... I've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems..."
1,Save Your Money!,"As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value."
1,Don't bother,"A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."
4,You'll enjoy this CD,"I got a huge kick out of Vinny's interpretations of the Beatles' songs that they never recorded. Sure. they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped, as has been written here. But the don't mimic previous covers, but try to recreate the early Beatle sound. It's light and it's fun. It's is not a must have as a Beatles fan, but I think you'll get a big kick out of this disc."
1,IT STINKS ON ICE.,"Wavery-voiced pop icon Madonna and incomprehensible non-singer Banderas absolutely destroy this wonderful score. The orchestrations are hideous. Pass this one by, and get the Broadway version (a masterpiece) with LuPone(BRILLIANT!) and Patinkin."
3,Not Bad....,"This version of Evita is okay. Some songs were made a lot better like ""On This Night Of A Thousand Stars"" with its new tango feel, ""And The Money kept Rolling In"" with its extended instrumental or ""Goodnight and Thank You"" with its much more career driven lyrics.However, the same can't be said for other songs. Buenos Aires was murdered. Such a song that was so energetic in both the original concept recording and the original Broadway recording became flat and repetitive. Rainbow High was butchered for the removal of anything relating to ogliarchs and aristocracy. Eva's Sonnet forgot to turn up to rehearsals and made Madonna's Evita politically bland. And Lament-it hurts me to think....Madonna looked like Evita but did not sing like her. There is no underlying ambition or ruthlessness in her voice (maybe except in her speeches). Antonio is good but becomes hard to understand in complex verses. Pryce is a boring puppet"
3,"Madonna does a nice job but, the Broadway Cast does it BEST","Madonna and Antonio Banderas do a nice job. But, their performances lack the power and emotion of the Broadway Cast. You have try the Broadway version with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin."
1,The poorest of all the versions to date.,I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version.
4,Pretty darn good,"If you're like me, then you probably find cast recordings of Evita long and drawn out. Well I've found that this recording flows very smoothly and the music has a nice, slightly updated sound to it. I hear a lot of die hard Evita fans critisice and insult the film version and Modanna and Antonio's talent, but the fact is, this is a good recording and the stars do a fine job"
4,You must get this soundtrack,"There are two soundtracks for this movie, get this one. Yes, it is a bit more expensive, but if you want to get the full expierience of an incredible soundtrack with even more incredible talent performing it, then this is an absoute must!"
5,This cd is worthy of 100 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think Evita is the best music piece ever. Madonna and Antonio Banderas are the best Evita and Che. This musical is probably the only one where I listen to EVERYTHING. Even tracks like ""A Cinema in Bueonos Aires"" even though it is not even music."
4,It's Ok . . . .,"I love it ! My favroite song is the 2nd one in disk two called,"" Don't Cry for me Argentina!"" I think It's the best recodings ever."
2,Lush but flawed,"There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."
5,EVITA SOUND TRACKS,I ordered the sound tracks for the film Evita since the 1st of Dec.'07 I am still waiting for it to be delivered. I have been a long time customer of Amazon and I've never had any problems with deliveries before. The item ordered was meant to be a Christmas present. Since it's not here where is it? I need an answer please...P.S Happy New Year to you all.Chas>>>>>
3,disappointing use of major talent,"I am a Madonna fan, and I think she acquits herself quite well on this CD. She also was fantastic in the movie, but the CD doesn't hold up on repeated listenings. First, Antonio Banderas can't really sing - he has emotion and drama but a really weak voice. Madonna's voice is stronger than it used to be but can't measure up to the power and beauty of Patti LuPone, who is a Broadway-trained diva. Jonathan Pryce has a wonderful voice which is so ill-used on this CD as to be criminal. He doesn't get to truly sing at all but rather sing-speaks a few lines here and there. I think in several years if you haven't seen the movie, you won't understand why everyone liked this CD because it is, in the end, thin."
5,Great movie and soundtrack,"I loved the movie EVITA and rented it so many times, the movie store eventually sold it to me. The songs are upbeat and there's a variety, so it kept my attention. Banderas and Madonna made a great pair!"
2,Buy another version. Any other version.,"Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead."
1,The worst EVITA ever,"The motion picture soundtrack, yet alone the motion picture of EVITA, is terrible. Hollywood, as usual, took a wondeful piece of work (the hit musical EVITA) and butchered it to be their way. Patti LuPone is a far better Eva than Madonna, and at least you can understand Mandy Patinkin, unlike Antonio Banderos. Also, Hollywood turned the orchestrations into modern rock 'n' roll junk, when the 1979 Premiere American Recording is the way EVITA should be. So don't waste your money on the movie sountrack, and buy the Premiere American Recording instead"
3,"Not impressed, Madonna","I have never seen the stage show, but a few months ago got the Original London Cast recording of it, with Elaine Paige and David Essex as Evita and Che. I loved it and listened to it non stop for about a month or more. Then I got the DVD of the Madonna Evita out and thought it was the dullest film I've ever seen, (but you can read the reveiws of the movie if you want to know about that) and Madonna didn't quite live up to Elaine Paige. Her voice is not quite as rich and beautiful as Paige's, and Madonna seemed to make everything so...'pop'y. For example 'Buenos Aires'. I loved Paige's version of that, but Madonna turned it into an awful, tacky, Latin-American pop song.The material is great, but not the artists. I'm not sure about the Broadway recording, but I would recomend that people buy the London cast, rather that this one."
1,HORRIBLE,"This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......"
3,I'm I Missing Something?,"Not sure if people here are completely honest. Madonna's vocal performance on this amazing EVITA score was not much to be desired. There were obvious vocal limitations, and Madonna improvised all the way through. The ""music"" in this soundtrack was good. Antonio Banderas is also another who was not vocally qualified for this incredible Andrew Llyod Webber musical production. Patti Lupone and Mandy Patikin were the true vessels of talent for the EVITA project."
1,Have not received my item in a month.,"My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
5,Reliable,"I bought this printer for my son's new computer which runs XP. No problem loading the software, no paper jams, no problems at all. For [the money]including the USB cable. I am still using an HP Deskjet 540 that I bought with my Packard Bell Pentium 75mHz over 6 - 8 years ago. The PB is gone, but the HP lives on and on and on. That's says a lot. New print heads with each cartridge I think is the way to go. Will use 825 mostly for text, but having printed a photo, it compares fairly well with my Epson 780 with glossy paper."
1,Magenta,This thing is awful. Prints magenta only. Drives me crazy. I am going to go find a high building to throw it from.
1,limitations of color printing,"This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed."
5,ordered used received new,"I ordered an used copy and received a brand new one. Mistake? I don't know. Quick shipment and delivery. For about $10 I am very happy with this purchase.I bought it for school, and the content is interesting.I was surprized by the size of this book. It is almost like a pocket book"
2,Not pleased with Express delivery!,"My review is not about the book. This is one of my textbooks I needed for my course and I was glad that Amazon had it in stock. However I chose to pay highest shiping amount to express delivery for next day, (which happens to be Saturday) so that I have time to review chapter before school started, it did not arrive that Saturday. What is purpose was next day delivery if you don't receive the product on time? I think I paid about $25 for one book when there was an option to receive Monday delivery for much less ($10, I think). The book arrived on Monday after my school started and I did not have a book to take to school. Amazon owes me money!"
3,Rate: Fair,"For me, it was uncomfortable sleeping here. My cousin said she had no problems sleeping on it. So it depends on the person. It will definitively save your life if you got invitees and you don't have extra rooms."
5,Great value,I love how high it gets - I have bad knees and have trouble getting up from a position where my knees are bent more than 90 degrees - and it is so easy to set up
1,Disappointment,"I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
1,SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON,The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day.
3,It's ok,"The Mattress is OK, I bought it for my friend who stay with me for 3 weeks. It loose some air every-other day. No 100% comfortable you'll need a mattress pad, but for the price you are getting a "" decent"" mattress"
2,Did not last long,"We used this for less than 21 days for a guest. It does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air; by the time you wake up in the morning, it has shrunk to less than half it's inflated height. There is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out. We had to return it to Amazon. We bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress, not compact but less risky than an airbed."
2,Doesn't hold air,"I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east, the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor. I tried to send it back but it was impossible to get back into the box."
3,Could have been better,We have a double size of these but needed a twin. I ordered this and it came pretty quick. Box was in good condition and intact. Unfortuantely the night befor our company was to arrive I went to inflate it and noticed it leakin. Just below the pump there was a 1/2 inch slic and another near slice below that. It looked like the pump or something damaged. I had no optio but to use the repair kit and keep it as I had no time to wait for a replacement or to pay the shipping again. Not sure how to avaid this. thevinyl does not seem plyable enough tha it fractured the material or something.
4,A great bed!,"I love this air mattress. It inflates quickly and is super comfortable. I just wish I had NOT bought the raised one. If you move around too much or get too close to the edge, you feel like you're going to roll right off of it. I think it's because of the high center of gravity or something. But, overall, highly recommended! BONUS - Unlike most things, you CAN actually fit this back into the bag once you're done with it!"
1,Utter Garbage,"Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"
1,Seams Came Apart After 5th Use,"I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same."
2,All of mine have not lasted long.,"A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model."
1,Would not inflate RETURNED,"I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands."
4,convenient twin airbed,"First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed."
2,It could be better,"Currently, there are no wholes throughout the bed. But, for some reason when I wake up. The bed is already out of air. I only weigh 120lbs. I don't understand why it does that. Please save your money, when you start to have the same problem."
2,"One Was Good, So I Bought Another-Big Mistake","I purchased the first airbed and found it to be exactly what I wanted. I ordered and received a second one which I have not yet used. Meanwhile, the first one has sprung a leak and is not usable. Big disappointment. No reason for leakage as it has been used only for small individuals."
3,my opinion of this product,this product is ok i fill it up but it does lose a little air which makes it not stay firm
5,As comfy as a regular bed,Bought this for my summer cottage for extra guests. Very comfortable. Great size and built in Air Pump made it a breeze to inflate. The Velour top was also a great plus. Would reccommend highly.
5,Fantastic Bed,"I bought this bed, for my niece who was visiting. The bed was so simple to put air in it, took about 3 minutes or less and very comfortable, did not have to put more air in it the whole weekend. It was much better than the Aerobed, and cost less. I have been through three of them, which didnt last past two years. It was well worth the purchase, will buy another one. Fast shipping too."
1,Worst airbed ever - Don't buy,"If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product. Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing."
2,RETURNED IT!,"We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over. Nice looking, but don't let looks deceive you. By the morning, you won't have any air in your bed."
5,Great Product A++++++,It fills up really fast and is a sweet bed. Best Airbed ever!!!! A must buy item.... Fast shipping as well =)
2,Lasted a month,"It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat. I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only."
4,Easy to setup and comfortable,"I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints."
4,I love this bed! carry it anywhere!,"I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the ""airbed"", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one."
2,Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump,This product is very difficult for me to use. The air pump does not connect easily and I would not recommend it.
1,Huge disappointment,"I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
3,Worked well for 90 days.,Worked well while it lasted. Honestly very satisfied until it failed at one of the seams and now has a huge bump on one side. Manufacturer says this product carries no warranty when amazon clearly states it does. Anyways Amazon took the product back for a 100% refund so I guess Im happy. Everyone keep in mind that this is not a long term solution.
2,I couldn't find the leaks.,"When it started leaking I couldn't find the leaks. First the top started leaking, later the bottom so now I have totally given up on it.It was comfortable before it started leaking."
4,Nice,"I have not completely set this item up yet, but thus far looks like a great mattress for extra sleeping accommodations. Is for my college-age son via family visits...."
2,"Comfortable, but leaked the first night","it inflated easily and was very firm, by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer, and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor. easy enough to reinflate, but still, this should not happen the first night."
5,Great Product.,I sleep on this until I got a real mattress. Great for allergies. Will keep it in the car in case I spend the night at the kids house.
4,It Great works.,It is very comfortable and easy to use. The only thing they could improve on is the storage bag. It should be larger. It is difficult to put is back in the bag.
1,Didn't Last,I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again.
4,Guests love it.,Inflates fast. Nice shape when inflated stores well. Guest are getting a good nights rest. Would reorder if we need more.
4,Good buy,I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.
4,"Small bed, big punch","This bed was bought after realizing that the Queen size air mattress I bought from the same company was a pile of crap. This mattress was only intended to be temporary, but it survived for probably a good six months with only a small leak being sprung toward the end of the six months. For four out of those six months, it was shared with my girlfriend because we couldn't afford anything else. Yeah, it was awkward, but the little thing held up. The only reason I stopped using it was because I finally got the money to afford a real mattress, so we've moved on. But this mattress will forever be used as a spare guest bed...perfect height, only a very minor leak, and once you get used to it...very comfortable."
4,So far so good!,"Well so far we are satisfied. It is easy to inflate with a very convenient built in pump, which so far actually works. My daughter says it is very comfortable, and , so far, it surprisingly isn't losing air. Some do and require frequent inflations.I would highly recommend it, and for the price, it is a very good purchase.As they suggested, it isn't meant to be inflated and deflated constantly, so we try to keep it inflated, cause my daughters use it for sleepovers, and their friends love it."
1,huge LUMP after a few uses...,"i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!"
4,Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump,The Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump is a amazing purchase comparing price and quality.
1,on website it says twin but actual size is single.,i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone.
2,not the one I ordered,"I have always recived what i ordered, but this one was not ..I ordered the hi rise, but recieved one way to short to the ground..it was to much trouble to send back, Im too old..I was dissapointed as now I can,t use it..husband can , but I can,t..be careful you get the right product..."
3,IT was good and just what I needed.....but!,"It's well constructed bed and durable and really liked it...however after a few weeks, it loosing air and does not fully inflate anymore."
3,Air mattress,"Both mattresses got holes in them within two months, so they are no longer being used. Don't know the specifics."
2,losing air already!,We used the airbed for one guest (my very careful mother-in-law) over the holidays and it was fine. My son took it on a trip and it began loosing air the first night and he has not been able to use it since. I would not buy this again and in fact will try to return it when he returns home with it.
1,Only good for a couple of use,"I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there."
1,worthless,I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.
1,Not good,It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away. I don't recommend this air mattress.
1,3 weeks and heard a big boom!,Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!
5,"Comfortable, Inflates Beautifully","Does everything I expected it to. The built in pump works perfectly (for both inflation and deflation), and it hasn't sprung a leak on me yet."
5,Perfect for me,I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone
5,Excellent product!,I was very happy with the airbed that I chose - it met all my expectations - service was excellent.
4,Worth the money.,"Needed place for kids to sleep while visiting grandma and now they argue over who gets to sleep on the air mattress. Both think it's more comfy than their bed at home.Would have given 5 stars, but the bag it comes with to put it in is worthless, no chance of ever getting it in there again."
3,50/50,"I purchased two of these mattresses and am sorry to say that only one of them works as advertised. One arrived defective out of the box and had a pinhole leak somewhere that we could not identify. When we tried it before a trip it looked to hold up just fine, but even without any weight on it it was deflated after about 2 hours.The return process occurred without an issue, and the second mattress is fantastic, but I would strongly strongly strongly recommend heavily testing this before your first ""real"" use. At a minimum try to blow it up and see what it looks like in the morning, if there is any sign of loss of air, return it right away."
1,"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this","I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
1,A total dud,"Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future."
3,Leaky bed,"I recently moved into a smaller apartment and could not take my lovely King size bed. Ended up getting a twin platform and decided that a regular mattress would just be too heavy trying to get into this place. Saw this air mattress and decided to try it. At first it was great! Supportive, comfy...however I have only had it a couple of months at most and now it's leaking air. I can find nowhere to patch it, just a slow leak that gets worse each day. I thought I had perhaps accidentally opened the air release valve a bit, so I inflated the bed and left it all day with no weight on it. Sure enough, it's saggy after only 6 hours. At least I bought it on sale, so I'm only out $25 but still it's annoying to have to replace it already."
5,Best Bed for the Buck,"For the price, this air mattress is a great bargain. Inflates fast, deflation is done via the fan motor which speeds up the process, compact and light, easy to store.....I highly recommend this as quick and easy way to accommodate the need for an extra bed."
2,Faulty advertising,"At 80"" iong, this is an extra long twin, not a standard twin. Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought, as they were 5"" too short. I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80"" wasn't standard. It's easier just to replace the sheets and I don't have time to send the bed back."
1,Angry,"I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed. I was at first excited but as the week, past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable. for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed. Least to say thanks the quality is poor! I do not recommend."
1,Crappy Air bed,Airbed doesn't keep air overnight. If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that doesn't work so you will get no refund.....exchange it for another crappy airbed...My recommendation is....don't buy this crappy airbed!!
2,do you hear air?,"This item loses air overnight. Must be inflated daily if not nightly. If you return this item the store won't take it back, you must ship to the maker at your expense. Or you must cut the air pump out because they don't trust you not to keep using it, like we have to trust them on their quality."
2,Comfortable... if not for the deflation.,"I received the bed, and I loved it. But after one night it almost completely deflated. I tried to find the holes but I found none, so it was kind of a waste of money."
2,"Was hopeful, but . . .","I was hopeful this mattress would work out, having read mixed reviews, but as others stated, the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night. My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem."
2,I so wanted to love this item,"Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that."
5,Air Bed Twin Size,"This item arrived on within just a matter of a few days. It sure did serve its purpose. It took about a minute to inflate and deflate I am very pleased with this product. Would buy from seller again, definitly."
5,Awesome!!,I love how quickly inflates & deflates! Maintains fullness throughout the night! Love that's it's raised high enough for getting in & out of bed! Very easy to store away. Love the tote in which you can carry to anywhere you may need to travel. Totally recommend it!!
4,practical and good quality,My wife and I bought 2 of those for our vacation home and they are practical as they have an electrical pump build in and quite comfortable. We slept very well on them. We also liked the fabric surface very much.
2,Valve broke after a couple of uses,"My mother bought this bed for my 5 year old to use when we visited on weekends. Worked great the first 4 or so times she used it. But now the valve that lets the air out won't close. It spins, but does not seal shut so you can't inflate the mattress. Very poor quality."
1,NEVER BUY THIS AIRBED!!!!,"All these airbeds look good on pics. But the common problem for all these even well known brands is deflating. The tightly inflated airbed almost completely deflates by the morning, even if u find the leakage and seal it, by next day other leakage will appear. it is horrible feeling like u are on the boat during the storm when it is flat. Eventually after buying 3 airbeds from well known brands i bought spring mattress for 100$ and feel very good without needing in inflating it every morning!"
2,Not as good as Aero Beds..... was disappointed,"It works but the next morning it has lost some shape and isn't as comfortable as it could be. For the price and the function is okay, the twin size made it right for our allowable space - but if you will need a longer term solution it is probably better to invest in a more expensive air bed."
1,Low cost defective product,"This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice."
5,Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative!,"I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers."
2,bed leaked on first use,I ordered for use when company came-my niece slept on this once and ended up on the floor after one night. I cannot recommend this to anyone.
1,Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop,"We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now."
3,Use temporarily,Not great for long term use but okay if you're using it for weekend guests or on trips. It doesn't stay firmly inflated for long periods of time.
4,great extra grandchild bed,I needed an extra bed for my 4 year old grandson...this really fit the bill...he loves sleeping on his inflatabable bed...inflates and deflates in minutes..
1,not 80in in length,"I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back."
4,It's ok...,"It's convenient to take around. I think the only complaint I'd have is that it makes squeaking noises when you move around and THAT sound wakes me up... Other than that, it's sturdy and as comfortable as a airbed can be."
3,Comfortable but did not last long.,"This airbed is great at first. The pump is included inside the bed, so it's easy to pack and travel with. It is comfortable, too. However, I have used it only four times and the bed is already losing air significantly over night. There must be a hole somewhere, but good luck finding it."
1,Went flat in the middle of the first night.,This airbed does not stay inflated. It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it. It is junk. Don't buy it. If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day.
1,Garbage,Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars.
5,Good quality bed,"I bought this to use whilst staying at my sister in laws house for a couple weeks around Christmas. This bed is awesome! It pumps up very quickly and is comfortable and big enough. My nephew is 6ft and 220 pounds and I'm 5'5 and 140 pounds and we could both lay on this whilst watching a movie with no problems. I used it for 2 weeks and only inflated it slightly on the second day, I think the material stretched a little during my first nights sleep to break it in and thats why it seemed like it lost air. After the second day I never had to refill it. I left it there when I went home and my nephews are still using it and love it more than their regular beds."
4,perfect.,actually i love it . but i just gave 4 stars because i think its a little bit smaller than what i think .
4,it does the job,The airbed is easy to inflate and it holds air. It is confortable and easy to store away. I recommend it.
5,No complaint,"Really good product. For this price, I give it a 5. Very comfortable and easy to use. You do have to refill the air after two nights though."
4,Quick and Easy,"This bed is so easy to use. Just plug it in, turn it on, and walk away. The pump is built in, so you don't have to worry about keeping up with an air pump, using a hairdryer, or finding double D batteries to power your pump."
2,"No-Go,sorry","Was nice while it lasted. After a few nights on the mattress, one of the seams in the middle apparently broke. Now it's nothing but a large bubble in the center. Tried flipping it over but it's like sleeping on a rocking chair. Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster."
3,Good price but could get pain in back,Product is as described on Amazon. The pillow is good solves it purpose. The only issue is it has a slope in middle of bed. Which makes the back go down and below the legs and head level when you lie on it. I got back pain in 2-3 days of using it.
5,What a deal!,This is an incredible air mattress. We purchased this for a last minute house guest. It was shipped quickly. The mattress itself is very nice and comfortable. And the automatic pump makes blowing up and deflating a breeze!!! I would highly recommend to anyone needing an air mattress
1,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed, deflating within 3 months",I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it. This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with.
1,Wont hold air after 32 days since online purchase thru amazon,Product was defective from day on and lasted a whole 32 days and now will inflate but by the middle of the night you sleeping on the carpet.
5,Thank You,I bought this for my daughter to use when she visits. She found it was so comfy that it was hard getting her out of it at all. It came packaged nicely & was exactly as described on Amazon. Very pleased!
4,compact and affordable,"my house is so small that i can't justify losing space to an extra bed. a twin air mattress was really the best solution since we only have company once or twice a year. So far, i've only used it once. The price and the built in air pump were the main reasons for purchasing. It mostly stayed inflated, but my mom did say it could have used a little more air the second night. There is a storage compartment for the power cable, which is nice when it is inflated because there isn't the risk of someone tripping over loose cords. The mattress has just enough height on it so you don't feel like you're sleeping on the ground. The pictures make it seem like there is a groove for a fitted sheet to slip into, but it's really just a seam. Not a huge deal if you have sheets with good elastic, but they might get stretched out over time. Overall, the design is compact and it does what it is supposed to do, at the right price. i'm happy with it."
3,average product,"Its a average product.Pros:cheap;easy to carry;inbuilt pump;not very comfortable but you can sleep on it.cons:Small for a tall guy;needs regular pumping;gets stained easily;trips easily.My opinion is air beds is not suitable for everyone,If you like a hard bed don't buy it.But if you are low on cash or change accommodation frequently this bed can be useful."
2,It doesn't stay firm even overnight.,It doesn't stay firm even overnight. The motor burned out after a while. I bought a Coleman. . . .
3,twin airbed OK,I like the fact that the pump is built in. I don't like that it tends to lose air over night. It does not go flat but it a lot softer.
1,Short Product Life,"This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer."
1,"nice sleep, but bottom seam blew","Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it."
2,slow leaking,"Air mattress: Looks good, works but requires frequent running of pump. Appears to lose air through the built-in pump. Should have returned the mattress but need the bed for visitor. Probable would not buy with built-in pump in future."
3,Twin Air bed,"This is a nice airbed. It is easy to set up and its comes with a nice smoth top surface so you do not slide off from it. The pillow shape helps a lot if you have a low pillow. The cons are: for some reason, it requires you to inflate it after one use. I think the valve is not strong enough to create a good sealing. And as all airbeds, it helps to place it against a wall to avoind the jello effect. If you can fit it into a corner, that will give you a lot of stabilitty. I like it."
2,doesn't leak but uncomfortable to sleep on,"I bought this product because I'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later, and don't have the extra money to buy a better bed. Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it. I've lost interested in sleeping after that. Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess. If you intend to sleep on it for a few months, buy a comfy bed instead of this!"
4,Very satisfied!!!!!!!!,"I have not seen or slept on this mattress........bought for my daughter for a quick replacment.............she tell's me she thinks it GREAT.....I bought the twin size,and she tells me when she buys a full size it will be the same one. I have an inflatable bed she has slept on while visiting, and she said this is 100% better. I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased."
3,intex pillow rest twin airbed,"The first one I bought, after a week it stopped working. I got it replaced for another one, however this one takes too much time to deflate. I am not sure if this one is defective too, but over all I don't think this is such a great product."
2,Not Durable,Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem. I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air. I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds. I sleep on this airbed every night. There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that's just me or the bed is yet to be seen. To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time. I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL
2,Cheap Not worth your money,I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head. The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up. If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else. Not worth the money. I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole.
4,good value,"while only used a couple of times, it seems well constructed, held the air pressure, was easy to inflate as well as deflate. A great value."
2,Worst Air Bed Ever.,This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use. I found the leakbetween a crease in the top (flocked) side. After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated. I have put the air bed to better use. Thank youKeith Colton
5,Excellent product!,"One of the best air mattresses I've owned. Extremely easy to fill and let the air out, just plug in and flip a switch. I like that it's all one unit, the plug and air in/out take is attached and hidden in a compartment. It's comfortable and does not loose air, even over an extended period of time."
5,Most Excellent,Love it! this bed fits the bill. my guess like it compliments on how comfortable it is. Easy to inflate and store. An excellent buy in my book. The built in pump is a super feature.
4,I would definatly buy this again,The bed was comfortable and filled easily. It's only draw back was that did not fit all the way back into the carring box.
1,Leaked,"We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box."
1,Not satisfied,"The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates."
2,Electric pump failed,Took it to France and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew. Bought a hand pump to pump it up. It was a painful job. After it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable. Decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box.
1,This bed will not retain air.,It was a super deal... But there is something wrong with it. It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item
1,Not available.,"I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex."
5,Great extra bed or travel bed,"I took this with me on a vacation for our guest to use. But, it is so comfortable that it turned out that I used it the whole week and gave the guest the actual regular mattress bed and used this air mattress instead. I have used it for 3 different 1 week vacations and have had no problems with it. It even deflates electrically so it fits back into the travel bag it came with. Amazing deal."
4,Awesome product but not completely accurate,this product is amazing i took it camping and loved every minute of it ... it is a great product and very comfortable... the pictures show it to have a manual inflating pump like most inflatables but this one does not have that port. Not a huge deal just thought needs to be exactly what is in picture but the actual mattress is amazing and i would definately buy one again
2,Leaky unit,"I ordered this bed in an emergency situation for my 95 year old mother to sleep on. The bed was easy to fill and evacuate, but it has a slow leak that necessitates adding air to it every day. I couldn't send it back because I would have had nothing for my mother to sleep on."
1,customer service is dead,every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks
4,Has not failed yet!,"I have had this for almost 6 months and there has been no problems. For $40, I think that is a good deal. Folding it up is a bit hard with the pump inside the mattress, but I guess that is the case with any model like this.It was surprisingly cheap. I remember agonizing over if I should spend more money or go with this one... I seems to be fine.That being said, I have only used this indoors. I will do some tent camping in the summer, I think it will be fine for that also."
1,Just like all the other airbeds,"I filled it with air when it arrived. It lost air by the morning. Since the bed was cold when filled, I gave it another chance. The first night is was actually used, it had to be refilled in the middle of the night."
2,Lasted one month of everyday use,I used this product for one month of every night sleeping before it sprouted a leak in one of the seams on top that couldn't be patched due to the fabric. It makes patches virtually impossible to stay stuck.There you have it.
3,Good quality but....,"This is an ""off the floor"" airbed, higher sides than the usual, which is good. But they need to design some sort of offset to mimic a mattress where the edges of the sheets can be tucked in. As is sheets wind up coming off almost immediately...including the special air bed sheets I bought with it. My guests also did not like the raised head end.Inflated great, deflated great, seems like decent build quality."
3,Purchase,"I ordered this airbed on November 30th 2010 and was promised to receive it on December 3rd 2010.I did not receive my item until December 30th 2010. I had actually given up thinking I was not goingto receive it and alerted my credit card company to cancel payment. Other than that, the airbed is okay.It is not as nice as the Aerobed but it does stay inflated and it should suffice."
4,Great price with good quality !!,"Recently I've got this air bed for my guest.It includes electronic pump and it takes about 5 ~ 7 mins to completely put an air for using.No leaks and it stands for a month, but after that period, there were some air leaks. But it's ok !recommand !!!"
4,Sweet!!!,"This mattress is absolutely a best buy for me as I basically use it when I just need to find my own space. It's affordable, easy to inflate, even easier to deflate and simple for anyone to do."
2,Air Mattress works great,We loved the internal pump which also will pump the air out. It is so fast and the mattress itself gives a good night's sleep.
4,COMFORTABLE BED,Its a very comfortable bed. I bought this one because of the built in pump and was happy to find that it doubles as a vacuum pump to rapidly deflate the bed when you need to pack it away.Being an air bed it is really light when inflated. It should not be used on the edge of high places or staircase case.
3,have to inflate it every night,I bought this about a month back and initially it was pretty good. But now I have to inflate it every night before I go to bed as it gets pretty deflated by the morning. The size and feel is pretty good but inflating it every night gets pretty frustrating. My friend has been using a different and more expensive brand for over 6 months now and he has had no problems. So I suggest spend a little more money to get a better deal.
5,Scout Mom -B'ham,"I needed this for a Scout outing, had no idear about air mattress. I wanted something easy to carry and not to many items. This air mattress is true to it's word. Just like my home bed, comfort and ease of sleeping. Ease for filling and letting air out. Going to order another one that is larger."
5,Bueno,"Good afternoon I would inform them that the item was received in perfect conditions, and they estimated the time, so I give the maximum score. thanks"
3,OK to sleep on but needs frequent inflation,"The bed is fairly comfortable for sleeping, but doesn't hold air from day to day or through the night. Every night I slept on it I had to inflate it."
4,Extra rack needed.,Hubby goes to a huge pig-roast with retired and active navy guys every year. Bunks in the campers are prized beyond all else (except the kegs). Our friend was dumped after one of the guys decided at the last minute to not bring his camper. I had a trail of Amazon prime so I quickly ordered this mattress. It was delivered on time. It blows up pretty quick and was very comfortable ( was used by two different people on different nights). It holds air well and over a 3 day weekend only needed a quick shot of air once. I think the only complaint was it was a tad bouncy and one of the sleepers fell to the floor (maybe had something to do with the drinking). When deflating make sure it does not suck onto itself or the pump gets whiny. Fits well in it's well constructed carrying bag. Glad to have made the purchase. Highly recommend for a spare rack.
2,LEAKED FIRST DAY FOR MY GUEST,IT HAD A LEAK FROM DAY ONE. RETURN AND EXCHANGE PROCESS WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH. STILL WAITING ON THE NEW ONE
5,Easy to inflate - comfortable,"I bought one and it was so easy to use and quick to inflate, that I ended up buying one for a family member as well. The pump is build right into the mattress so you don't have to worry about misplacing the pump as with many other air mattresses. Inflates in just a few minutes and the pump is not as loud as other pumps I've had in the past."
4,comfortable and easy to use,"With a bad back, it is difficult to get off the floor when using an air mattress. The height of this solved that issue for me. The first mattress we received, leaked and I spent one very unpleasant night. But Amazon paid the costs of shipping it back, and the new one is doing well."
1,not reccomended,"Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months."
4,Slept great,"My daughter purchased this airbed for my long weekend visit to her one bedroom apartment. For three straight nights, I slept great. It didn't hold all its air all that time but what air mattress would? With the built-in pump, I just had to throw the switch and within seconds it was firm, comfortable and ready for another night's sleep.I also want to mention how easy this bed was to get out of. I have arthritis in my knees. Because this bed is the height of a mattress and box springs, I was able to get up and down easily. This also made it a great place to sit. This product is absolutely worth the money!"
2,Hold on a minute,"Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a ""strobe"" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin. I may buy some of the earlier volumes to see if they're the same... wish me luck."
4,Street Index Fine Print,"The street index is hard to read for the over forty crowd. If the font size was 12, it would have been much easier to read."
1,Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses!,"Although this is a good collection of Poe's short stories, the pages crisp and the typeface clear, THE TYPE ITSELF IS VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL! I am getting older, but do not need glasses yet and I can hardly read a word or two before my eyes begin to cross! I don't understand book manufacturers anymore. Either the typeface is illegible, the paper so poor that all the letters blot together, or the print is teenie tiny. Aren't books supposed to be read? Also, something strange, the chapters arent seperated. One story runs into the next without starting a new page."
2,Nesmith goes too far,"Carrying on from the mostly instrumental albums of ""The Prison"" & ""The Garden"", we get ""Rays"".Which is nowhere as strong as these albums, with Nez laying on the Synths, giving a slight Queen from the 80's feel (which nobody wants to hear).He also creates a horn section using the synths, which just sounds cheap & tacky.With ""Prison"" & ""Garden"" you hear richly textured & ambitious soundscapes, but ""Rays"" is to low-fi (which I don't have a problem with), it just doesn't work with such a complete piece of work.This is the only weak Nesmith album, so I suggest you purchase the rest of his back catalogue before arriving at this (low) point."
4,"A great case, get an Antec TruePS power supply to match","I was looking for an affordable aluminim case, which looked good and didn't cost an arm and a leg. Antec surprised me with this SuperLanBoy model.Not only does it work great (specially with led fans) but it also helps you keep your P4 system cool.Together with an Antec TruePS power supply, the chances of your system malfunctioning due to a cpu/mobo heat-related problem are zero.If you are building the ultimate ""fail-proof"" system, I recommend the use of 5,400 rpm hard drives (like Samsung's SV1204H if you can still find them), instead of the overheating 7,200 ones."
5,the band,"you've heard their music, now hear their words. this dvd gives insight into an extrordinary album of the early 70's; a release that was polar opposite to much of the musical landscape of the era. timeless tunes created by five talented musicians. the joy on levon helm's face is rich as he recounts how the harmonies of himself, richard manuel and rick danko were structured. an impromtu version of unfaithful servant performed by rick is just as emotionally poignant now, as it was on the lp. a couple keyboard demos by garth hudson is both pythonesque, and accomplished keyboardist, in it's scope. and with much less screen time compared to the last waltz, robbie robertson has a word or two as well. after viewing this dvd, cue up the band's lp on the turntable, or tray in the cd, and relive this great work once more!"
4,DVD review,Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.
3,Interesting for fans of The Band,"It's too bad that Levon and Robbie couldn't be interviewed together for this DVD. This is a reminder of the unfortunate rift between these two.If you are a fan of The Band, you would find the information interesting."
2,The Band,"Although the recording was somewhat ineresting, due to the lack of music in the recording I find very dissapointing. I will probably play it three or four times and then dispose of it."
1,Blah Blah Blah.......,"Good God, was this boring! I couldn't even finish watching it before I tossed it. I usually enjoy reading or hearing how artists create, it fascinates me. And I love The Band that used to be. But this was boring as heck. Sorry, Robbie. Sorry, Levon."
2,You're Kidding!,I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65.00! If you like 75 minutes of interviews with some musical clips (all far better in The Last Waltz--where each song is 100% seen on camera and mixed great) than send me $55.00 and I'll ship you my copy. I love The Band but this looks like a BBC TV doc.Bill
2,"Great power, not great shape","The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth. It was a bit uncomfortable, and I didn't love the bumps on the back (that you can't see in the picture or in the description), and the ""head"" of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package, it has an overwhelming smell of plastic, so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy. The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I wouldn't recommend it because I think you can do better. And I also think it's worth it to spend more money on a toy without phthaylenes (or however you spell it)."
2,way too big,"This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable."
1,ridiculous,I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~
1,Help!,"Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
3,Great buy for the money,"This is a good toy. It has powerful vibrations and the speed and intensity of the rotating beads are equally as strong. This vibe is made of a kind of hard rubber (not so hard that it would hurt you). I was hoping it was jelly instead but it's still worth the money. Other than that my only complaint is that I wish it had the pulsating feature, but I can't really complain because for the amount of money you spend on this toy you will def be satisfied."
2,Not waterproof!,"It's not water proof and it rusts on the inside. The turning head is a nice feature, but I don't think I really needed it."
2,Not worth the money,Not what I thought I was getting. I don't think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately I had to pay to find out.
1,PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE,WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!
1,Doesnt work,"First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
2,well,i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses. let me first say that it say 1 1/2 inches no it makes the rabit habit look tiny. its hugeat least 1 3/4 inch around. but its much slower than the other dosent vibrate near as fast. other than the size being more real size she liked the rabit habit better but we just got this one maybe it will get better. just goes to show bigger isnt better always. needs more power
5,Amazing!,"I'm 24 years old and have never had an orgasm. It's not that it's not enjoyable, it definitely feels good, but I've just never been able to get to that state. I've had sex with enough men and tried doing it on my own, it just never worked. Then I finally did something about it and ordered this item. It was my first toy. Within 2 minutes I had my first orgasm. WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO TRY A TOY?!?!? :p Now I just have to get a few more toys and introduce them to my sex life with my boyfriend...hopefully he won't mind ^_^"
1,"Painful, no pleasure, and doesn't work. Smells horrible!","First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though."
1,doesnt work,Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned
1,So Disappointing!,"I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again."
1,Disappointed again,Had a very toxic smell and probably will be toxic if used. No matter how much it was cleaned it still had a very strong smell. Scared to use it because of its smell. The ears and shaft are very hard and not flexible at all. It will be tossed in the trash. Another waste of money.
4,Above average JRV,"Bought as a replacement for one used for last 2 years. One received not quite as powerful as original, but gets the job done. Wife enjoys that it's thicker than others that have been used."
2,No go,"I did not like this one. It is a bit large and it has a plastic, rubbery smell that never goes away. It's also slightly loud. I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least."
3,I'm still looking,"I ordered this as my first rabbit, after reading the other reviews I thought that it would be a good choice. It arrived in very discrete packaging, which I thought was awesome. The price was good, especially when compared to other websites.It did have a slight rubbery smell to it when I opened the package, but it goes away.This rabbit is pretty large, but not so much so that it is unmanagable. When using it alone, I found that the rabbit ears are very stiff but if they are positioned right can get the job done. The revolving balls were REALLY uncomfortable and I ended up not using them at all. I think that if the rubber were a little softer that it may be a little more comfortable. Maybe its just not for me, but I was expecting alot more.The reason I gave it a 3 star rating -I let the hubby use it on me once, and it did its job well!"
3,"Worked well at first, but...","I ordered this product in June 2010, and was at first very pleased with it. However, about a month or a little more ago (Late September to early October 2010), the ""pleasure pearls"" stopped working. The vibration was still good, but it just wasn't the same without the rotating action. I expected this product to last longer than it did. Additionally, it did not handle natural ""clenching"" well, at such times the ""pearls"" would slow dramatically or even stop. Sometimes, when the batteries were low, it would also spontaneously turn itself off mid-use due to clenching. Also, I ordered the purple version, but received the clear version. Product was very wide and uncomfortable at first, I strongly suggest lube and going very slowly the first few times. Would I buy again? Probably not."
3,HUGE,This product works as described but the girth on this toy is massive. NOT for beginners! Material is kinda of hard too.
1,DISAPOINTED,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,Was great while it lasted,"I absolutely loved this toy at first. It was really amazing. About three months of use, the rotating beads stopped working. The batteries were fully charged and everything, but nothing. It still vibrates and everything and still does the job, but I just wish it lasted longer."
2,Totally Dissapointed! Like a bad Lover!,I just got this today and have been playing with it for a couple of hours and haven't gotten a decent orgasm. This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I don't think I will be buying any more. Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long doesn't help. After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this! The vibe itself is way too thick and it has a awful chemical smell. I should saved my money! I will continue to try and play around with it but I am not hopeful. The rotating shaft also does NOTHING for me..
2,Loved it - till we got it wet!,"It is NOT NOT NOT WATERPROOF! Loved it, till we tried it in the tub. Worked for 4 seconds, then stopped. VERY DISAPPOINTED...."
5,jack rabbit,"totally comfortable, and extremely sensual i love it.i adore the bunny ears and the controls are super easyi recommend for any woman looking for comfortable, intense pleasure (:"
2,Too Weak/Gentle,"Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle... I found it annoying."
2,Not for me,It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . So I just wasted my money...
4,Cal exotics Waterproof J Rabbit,"Good product, made well. Bullet has good amount of vibration. Hits all the right spots. I think the rabbits bullet should be placed a little higher for better stimulation. Also the beads inside are made of steel and if placed wrong can be a lil painful. The product however is worth the money."
2,No way!,This product worked for 4-5 times the the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
1,Great Transaction!!!,"Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
1,Not a good vibrator,I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item.
2,Disappointed,I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. A day later I'm quite disappointed. The bunny ears are razor sharp! Oucccchhhhhh!!!Definitely save your money and go for something else
5,OMG!,"What can I say?! I absolutely CANNOT believe how wonderful this product is! I own 5 toys and this one by far is my favorite! I have no regrets or complaints when it comes to me purchasing this product. It certainly gets the job done, and quick too. I have never had to use it for more than a few minutes, its amazing! It has 3 speeds of vibration for clit stimulation, 3 speeds of rotation in the shaft, you can change the direction in which it rotates, and it is completely submergeable! It even has a bumpy texture on the shaft to stimulate the g-spot. As far as batteries go, they do not have to be replaced very often either. This is a very well thought out invention and I can't think of any ways to improve it!"
4,Awesome,This is and was one of my most favorite vibrators. While the size is a little large the beads and movment of the shaft combined with the tantalizing bunny ears leave a Big O not to be forgotten! Couple of notes they state the item is waterproof not true a few uses in the tub and every time water got in battery compartment. Also this vibrator has a battery compartment that is removed from vibrator and this broke in a very short time rendering the vibrator useless. I tried to contact the company for a replacment compartment but no response thus far.
3,Good- for the right person,"I got this because it seemed sturdier than the vibratex one which kept breaking. This seemed studier- so I gave it a shot. It is sturdier, it is also larger, less pliable, and quieter. The larger and less pliable make it quite uncomfortable for me, especially when the rotating part is on. I think it would be good for those who can comfortably accommodate something wider."
1,California Exotics jack rabbit,Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..
2,Not waterproof,"I only used it a couple of times, a tiny bit of water leaked into the battery compartment and now it is rusted and won't turn on."
1,Not worth the money,"What a let down. I was so excited to get this because of the reviews, but when I tried it, it did nothing. First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all. This is not worth the money."
5,Wife loves this toy!,We were a little hesitant to add a toy of this nature to our collection but the wife absolutely loves this one!
5,Amazing!,This was my second toy and I love it! As soon as it arrived I tried it out. I highly recommend this! It is worth the $28.06 and shipping. I've never had an orgasm that powerful (:
3,ouch..,"Honestly, it's a nice toy (nice enough to make my boyfriend a bit worried), but i *hate* that it can't bend. It's a rough ride, but definitely worth a 'gasm or two. Worth the money you're throwing down for it."
4,sooo biggggg,"I had mixed reviews of this product. It most definitely got the job done, and fast! The only qualms that I had was that it was really large and hard to get in sometimes. Also I found that the rabbit ears would get in the way and could become annoying at times, but other than that it is a GREAT product."
4,MUST BUY ITEM!,I saw this online and bought it immediately. The only toy I ever bought before this was a small bullet and this blew it out of the park! AMAZING! You must buy. Most intense orgasm. Put's my boyfriend to shame!!!!
1,Nothing,Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money
3,a,does not do the job. Apparently the wife needs to hold her hand and a strange angle to get it to work. She rated 3 stars
3,Okay,Little bigger than I thought and not much movement but over all its does it job. The beads really don't do anything for me and I can't really feel it.
3,"The rabbit works, but not the rubber","It looks very promising, with competitive price. However, the experience largely depends on who is using it. The rabbit's vibration worked out fine, but the steady movement of the head and the beads wears off pretty quickly in that a getting used to stops any stimulus. Even though it is adequate in size, fully insertion might not be possible if the partner simply hate the rubber."
2,Disappointing,"Once again I wish I'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money."
3,Lasts about 1 year,I've bought 3 of these for my GF. She keeps it in the shower and we've learned either keep it dry or plan to replace annually. Local stores sell this for $56 and would not be happy at that price but at $30 on amazon it's a better vale. It is a nice toy other than waterpoofing.
2,Ouch!,The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.
2,Reviews are so off--terrible!,"I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money."
2,False Advertising,"The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has ""alternate views"" showing these items. And the kicker is that its 10$ more than the other colors, so it seems like its a package deal, but I only got the one purple vibe. I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really. I, for one, am about function over fashion. FALSE ADVERTISING!!"
1,Awful!,"I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the ""bunny ears"" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product."
1,Yet another disappointed customer,"Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
1,jams,"LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."
3,its ok,Little bigger than I expected. Need to get used to it. I think it will do the trick eventually. Looks cool.
2,Pretty large,Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration. All features are as described and rabbit is fast on slowest setting. Smaller would be better.
5,"So Good, I Bought Another","I bought this to replace the same item I'd purchased 2 years ago from Amazon and, after many, many uses, burnt out the vibe portion of the toy.This product is slightly thicker than average rabbits, but definately not oversized. The motor is quiet and VERY effective, almost too much so; my husband and I like to use it during playtime, but I find I often have to turn it down or off to hold back a little...Don't hesitate to purchase this; at this price point, it's the best you can get!"
2,Poor quality,"I gave this product as a ""special"" gift to my wife for Christmas, She just loved it for the first 2 times of use, except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud. Now it just spins away, but no vibrations. She will still use it on occasions, it can still get the job done, but for the money I payed it didn't last near long enough."
2,Not pelased,"I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this..."
1,Broken Item,Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it.
2,Looking For Similar to Better Shower Companion,"Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short. And the ""off"" button has stopped working (maybe it wants to keep going and going and going? *L*) I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it's OK. It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer."
4,Jack Rabbit,"I really enjoy this product. The only thing that's missing is a lock button. It tends to get very slippery at times, and buttons are accidentally pushed, which makes the experience less pleasurable. I would by this product again, but only if it has some sort of locking feature so I wouldn't have to stop and adjust it all the time."
1,Broken,"I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money."
3,could be better,"The overall construction of the product is good. However, the vibrating bunny ears are a little long and high on the vibrator and it seems impossible to get everything to line up, seems like you have to get it just in the right place and then be careful as to not move it. Also, while the vibrator is in use, if one squeezes hard enough the metal balls that move around are quite easy to stop and painful to the squeeze. It also tends to be a bit wider than most vibrators, which is good for me, but another girl I know can't enjoy using hers. It has nice speed setting options but isn't my favorite toy."
4,It's Big!,"It's really big. I'm not too impressed with the rotating dildo part because I really don't feel much and I guess I also feel more stimulation from thrusting. However, those rabbit ears (and the little nose too) are amazing. I can turn it on the lowest setting and it won't take more than 2 minutes for me to have the big ""O"". It would probably be a lot of fun with a partner."
1,"Looked good, didn't work","This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time."
1,Works really well right up until it doesn't,"It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."
1,Very disappointed,"I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it."
2,NO WAY!,This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.
3,Eh...,"There are a few good things, and to many bad things about this product. I'll start with the good!The vibration is awesome, its not to much but just enough.The handle makes this toy easy to hold onto and easy to find the buttons to control the speed...it even includes a reverse for the metal balls and the rotation!Its big, but not to big. I'd say just about right.The bad....I cannot use the metal balls/rotation part of this toy which is the main reason I bought it. While the size is great (it matches my partners size perfect)adding in something that rotates, moves, and is made out of metal...for me it was to much, and not in a the good kind of way. Using them for stimulation would probably work but using them while having an orgasm (to me) hurt.The ears are also slightly annoying...I cut mine down, otherwise they had a tendency to poke in all the wrong places.Overall this toy is a great buy, and even though the rotation part is out, the vibration is awesome and the size is nice."
3,"Good performance, but TOO big....","I really like the waterproof function and that the buttons are easy to manage. It is also really quiet. What i don't like is it is too big around.....i know, i know...that is supposed to be a good thing, right? but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. The girth makes it difficult to insert and much less stimulating when using it to manually simulate intercourse. If it was 1/2"" - 1"" smaller around it would be great!"
3,It was just ok,"This was just an ok DVD for me. I bought it with the impression it would be something like the other DVDs, Live at Red Rocks and The Dance. But it was more of a documentary than a musical DVD. This made it disappointing to me. But, hey, there are some people who will absolutely fall in love with it, I just won't be one of them.If you are looking for a history of Fleetwood Mac, then this would e for you."
1,Misleading.,"Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."
1,Zero Stars,"Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video."
3,Not bad,A Question? Does anyone know where I can get a VHS tape of the FM Rumors concert? It was the best live concert tape I've ever seen. Pls respond to krecsy@bayserve.net
1,A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY!,"THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO."
2,Buy something else,"The dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. I thought it was them in concert. Too much talking"
1,"eBay, here I come!","Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!"
1,Fleetwood Mac Rumours,"If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
2,If you want a rocumentary watch VH1,"Very disappointed with this DVD. Like I said above, if you want to view a rockumentary watch VH1 alot cheaper. Description very misleading."
5,"A ""Must Have"" for any FleetwoodMac Fan!!!","By far, one of the best videos I've ever purchased. This video takes each band member down memory lane and you get a wonderful inside scoop to what was really going on behind the scenes making Rumors. Stevie, Christine, Lindsey, John & Mick tell of how their very personal struggles with each other had to be put aside for the survival of the band. With all the emotions running in high gear, no wonder this was their best album yet. I had to watch it a couple of times...Remarkable video about a remarkable band."
5,excellent,"This DVD is fanstatic, the interviews are great the band has made it through all the tough times, they are going to have with each other and come out the other side.This insight to this classic album is just great a wonderful look, into their lives and problems they where having at the time.Now we can rely see and hear the rumours album the way it was.Now all that needs to happen, is for the record company to get off there back sides and re-issue the cd digitally remastered. While there at it do a new greatest hits digitally remastered, would be great too."
2,"disapointed after watching ""The Dance""","Having seen ""The Dance"" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying."
5,Awsome documentary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you love the Stevie and Lindsey era your going to love this CD!!! This is jam packed with interview with the entire band, how they got started, and all the ups and downs thru the years."
4,a behind the scenes of the making of one of the most important albums of all time,"it's good to go back and see how the band members felt and recall their time in making this very important album. i just love how the engineers and producers can go back to the studio and select different tracks, break them down so you can hear what went into them instrument by instrument. lindsey buckingham is a wizard in the studio. stevie nicks and christine mcvie are philosophical about those times and are interviewed in nice settings. mick and john are their practical selves. yea the music clips come up a little short. but it's not a concert tape. i'm glad they could put some of those clips in. an important look back on the making of one of the most important albums of all time."
2,It's just a nice to OK documentary,"It's disappointing to say the least. I'm not sure what Suzzette Phillips is talking about in her review, but on my version the classic album rumors isn't on my dvd. (And nowhere on the disc or packaging does it say the album is contained on the disc. Possibly, there are two versions? Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary. It would be great if they played the vintage live selections in their entirety."
1,too frustrating for the price,"Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing."
5,It's all good!,"This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs"
4,"Best choice, good price",Programing it was easy and adjust nicely to my system. After three weeks testing it is working fine as required.
5,Solid water timer,"I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong."
2,Not recommended,"Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect.Cons: Programming is not intuitive. Cannot adjust the manual valve-open time duration; it is fixed at 15 minutes (the manual states it is possible to adjust this, but I did not see how). 9V battery didn't last a week."
3,A ripoff re-issue of songs from four previous albums.,"I was truly disappointed that there is absolutely nothing new about this album. You might let folks know that this is merely a compilation of songs from Short's previous four albums. If, like me, you already have those four, you don't need this one."
1,1. Something Good,"I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon."
3,"Pretty good, pretty old.","Strange how much I heard this in 92-93 considering it was in the midst of the grunge/alternative wave. Hard to say if this was much of an influence on late 90's bands like Crystal Method or Prodigy. I doubt it considering they were harder, and better. Some of this was popular and very dancy like ""Something good"" and ""What can you do for me"", but alot of the rest is almost new age-ish, and I think one track even has a flute in it. They do sample Eurythmics, Kate Bush, and Kiss. As much as electronica has changed, this does sound pretty dated. But it's nice for a trip down memory lane."
5,If I was stranded on a desert island with one album...,"If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions."
3,"Works as designed, slow shipping, odd size drill bits needed.","Very affordable but had to buy 2 off size drill bits to install. Also, merchant was slow to ship the item.After installed they are working great."
5,Under Italy's Skin,"Virginia Ryan gives what no standard travel book could even approach: the authentic feel, taste and emotions of Italy, all interwoven in a fascinating personal story. It reads like a novel, yet takes you into an Italy that few tourists could hope to glimpse. Frances Mayes pales in comparison. I'd recommend it for anyone going to Italy, or who would like to go there in their armchair. It's a great, adventurous, authentic read. I loved it."
1,"Like the sprial binding, not much else","The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."
5,Motifs for stitchers,"This is a wonderful book: the spiral bound format makes it perfect to work from. The motifs themselves are clearly presented and lend themselves to stitching on all manner of items.From bookmarks to babywear, from towels to tableclothes: there is something here for every stitcher!Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,Garbage.,"Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers. ""plug and play"" install did not work. downloaded the appropriate drivers from Soundblaster and informed me that NO soundblaster card was found on my PC. attempted to contact vendor,no email was available, only a long distance phone number. Threw it in the trash."
2,I'm glad I didn't pay for it.,"I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up."
1,My First Negative Review -- Ever,"Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."
3,More About Tiger than Claude,"There is way too much information about Tiger Woods in this book and not enough about Claude Harmon. Who cares whether Tiger did his first long TV interview on Oprah? So what if people clapped for Tiger in a restaurant in Vegas? Most people who haven't been living in a cave for the last ten years are aware of how great Tiger is and what a record he has amassed. I understand that a teacher is proud of his student, but I can read that stuff in Tiger's book. And Butch goes on far too long about how important it is for people to learn from as many sources as possible. It really sounds like Butch is mad or insecure about Tiger leaving him.On the positive side, there are a few good stories about Claude Harmon and some of the greats from his era."
5,Highly recommended,"In this extremely useful book for understanding the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Lensing effortlessly traces the poet's life and development as those were important in determining the sort of writer Stevens would become. Many Stevens poems are explicated in terms of their original context, and a lot of fascinating information is provided about the nature of the poetry ""establishment"" of the early 20th century, and how important such sponsorship and networking was for Stevens' emergence as a major voice.This book deserves much more attention from Stevens fans that it seems to enjoy. It is very well written, a work of erudition and scholarship that avoids the all of the pedantry and other typical negatives of its genre. If you're a reader of Stevens, this is a book well worth owning."
3,Nazi out general the British and French,You will see old grainy news reels but if you are interested how the Nazi defeated France and trapped the British at Dunkirk this will explain how it happened. The DVD that I purchased would freeze at times for 5 seconds to 30 seconds. What you will view is not of a good quality video. I would only purchase this DVD if you are a World War II history buff and at low price of under a buck.
2,Ripped Off,"Not worth the money at all. None of the music is mixed togeather, like by a DJ. Most of the songs are not by the original artists! I wish I had never purchased this order, and will never again purchase such an items without being able to hear all of the songs. One last thought,,I was an 80's nightcluber,,, some of the songs I never, ever heard of and they are not good what so ever, just fill in songs."
2,Entire CS3 family crashes,"Effects isn't the only Adobe product in the CS3 family that crashes. We are having issues with all of them. Photoshop which doesn't normally import huge files is now crashing our Mac G4. I'm running Sony's Vegas Video at home which has quite a few ""effects"" add-ons available from other vendors. If Adobe doesn't straighten this out maybe Sony will take up the slack."
1,Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing...,"Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer. Even though Pete Rugalo(the talented jazz vocalist June Christy's regular arranger), who arranged this album, tried to make Miss Page sound listenable, it just didn't work out. Stay away from this CD or any CD that has the name ""patti Page"" on it."
3,Soundtrack ROCKS!!!,"After reading the post from Ryan Cragon, I felt compelled to write my own little review of this little film.Directed by Beastie Boy Mike D's wife Tamra Davis (Billy Madison, Half Baked, CrossRoads), this film dives into the world of extreme sports - motorcross, bmx, skateboarding, snowboarding and skiing. While the pacing of this movie seems a bit off, jumping from skiing to motorcross to bmx to skateboarding to snowboarding to surfing, this film lumps the sports together by similarities. seth morrison says he's influenced by motorcross, next sport is motorcross. travis pastrana says he's influenced by bmx, next sport is bmx. Pretty simple.the soundtrack was pretty amazing, i thoroughly enjoyed that aspect of the film.The film is a good intro into extreme sports, with some of biggest names representing their sport.The little skit that runs throughout the movie is cute at best. it gets a couple of giggles here adn there and is an okay filler. I'd say this is 3.5 stars."
3,do as you want...,"As specified above, the book isn't that good.Altough the book is high rated, many people may not want to read it.that's when the book report comes in: silently, Your teacher is plotting against you and your class mates. her plan is to make you read a boaring book(not all of the books, but most of them so no offence please), and then make you prove you did read it with a book report.the problem with the book report is that if the book is horribly boaring, you will brobably have to sit down and write boaring things while reading the same boaring chapter over and over again.my conclution is: if you have to do a book report about a boaring book, pay somone to do it for you, don't do it or get boared to death while trying."
2,Grainy image,"I can't resist writing a review, because I rely heavily on what others have to say too.I just bought the 1115 and it's being returned today. I've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap (my fault) and thought, what the heck I'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved, etc. This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products, but I'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable. The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes. Not sure what's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet. Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice, but for ""real"" photo images try Epson.Good luck!"
1,dont bother with XP,"I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Although they say it is xp compatable with driver, it is not. Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP. Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch. Hope this helps and God bless you!"
5,Brings Pogroms & Antisemitism into a sharp perspective.,"Potok, a master of the written word and an accomplished artist, recreates New York ""ghetto-life"" and makes it live through the eyes and life of a young boy growing up in New York between the two World Wars. The sensitive reader will experience unthinking hate, intolerance, love, intellect, and most of all, the perserverance of the human spirit--a vividly painted portrait of human existence and spirituality."
5,"The Gentle, Sensitive Intellectual","Averse to books (and movies) with gratuitous sex and violence? Try Chaim Potok. His books tend to honor the gentle, sensitive intellectual (see Elaine Aron's writings on highly sensitive people). In this book, you follow the childhood of David Lurie, a Jewish boy growing up in 1930s and '40s Bronx (New York). An early injury leaves him physically weak and vulnerable to teasing, but his scholarly talents, vivid imagination, and tight-knit community allow him to grow into a fine young adult with the courage to forge his own way, even when that means challenging some of the religious values of his family and friends."
4,Savory Goodness,"Beautiful, well crafted novel about a young man discovering himself as an individual separate from his father, his teachings, and his family. As in ""The Chosen."" Potok is a master at making the reader excited about learning for its own sake. Unlike ""The Chosen"", this is a far slower, deeper, and ultimatly moving story. Prepare yourself for the slow pace, but jump in. It's worth it."
3,"tacky packaging, cheap copy","Not really happy about this purchase. There's no plastic box, just cheaply printed cardboard. Looks like a knockoff to me."
5,A smart analysis of an understudied aspect of culture,"The movie industry in India is the world's largest. Steve Derne's book takes this idea and runs with it, using the film industry as a lens for focusing on Indian men's ideas about gender. It's a commonplace that, while people might not talk about their personal attitudes with a stranger, they are more than willing to discuss similar issues in their favorite films, and thus this report (as the very good previous review shows) reveals some surprising insights about how Indian men perceive the construction of masculinity.This book, unlike many sociological texts, is both scholarly and readable, and would make a good addition to undergraduate or graduate courses in area and gender studies. Highly recommended."
4,A must have book to overcome stress in our daily life,"This book give a brief story about Koichi Tohei Sensei, who developed and bring his knowledge about KI to our world.Within this book you will find summaries in practical KI for our daily life.The most impressive thing is the fact that relax and calmness is the key to a great strength."
5,PERFECT!,"This item came earlier than expected! It is everything I wanted and more! I speak Italian, so it was easy to read the instructions. You can change it to English if you like...SUPER SIMPLE! GRAZIE!"
5,"It challenged me to take ""my game"" of life up another notch","""A great book that motivates you to reflect on your current life and challenges you to be and do better. It made me wonder what people at my funeral would say to each other about me and the inpact I had on them, others, my profession and my community. It challenged me to take ""my game"" of life up another notch to live my life in a way that I can be proud of my signature work."""
5,Dianna Booher is a great life coach,"Those most likely to read this book will be those who are basically good people and they want to be even better. This book will help them. Those who Should read this book are all people who need a shot in the arm, a feeling of hope, a renewed sense of self confidence. This book will transform them!Dianna Booher is a unique thought leader in the field of personal and professional growth. She not only knows and lives the concepts, she also fully understands the steps to take. And she shows the rest of us the paths in her many wonderful works. The sports metaphor used to structure the book gives it a refreshing and memorable flow. You will love the book and like yourself even better after reading it."
4,Idol worship has changed,"I saw Bab's in concert in Vegas and have to say that she is still wonderful, but her voice has changed and deepen. It has been my dream to see her in concert my entire life and it finally made her a human being. The CD brings back memories of the concert, but does show the changes in her voice.She is still one of the greatest vocalist, but everyone get old!"
4,The Ultimate Diva!,The CD is very good. Enjoyed the patter with the audience. But she sounded MUCH better when I saw her live in Phoenix! Her voice sounds a little raspy in some points on the CD. I didn't notice that in concert. It could have been the excitement of finally seeing my all-time idol live for the first time. I hope she tours at least one more time before she calls it quits!!!ALL HAIL BARBRA!
1,Spare us,"I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
2,dissapointing,dissapointing in that the duets really do little justice to the songs. The duet5s in particular have beengiven inappropriate arrangements.
2,Boring: Who'd Have Thought?,"Apart from shrinking core of diehard fans, who is going to buy this? Most of the songs appear on other albums, the liner notes are schmaltzy, the sound quality is not that hot, and BS's voice sounds worn and tired.If she really cared, she would tour with all new songs and sing like she was happy to be there and NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS. :)For those of you unsure as to whether or not to buy the CD, wait a month and it will be in the cutout bin.I give this 2 stars in honor of the late Mr. Peter Matz, thanked by BS in the liner notes in her usual pompous way."
5,That wonderful laugh!,"Many here have commented how more relaxed Barbra appears to be on this live performance disc compared to earlier ones.No where is this more evident than in the many instances you hear her infectious, lilting laugh.As a student of Ms. Streisand I always treasued those brief moments of hearing that laughter on earlier concert recordings.She says she has been enjoying the concert tour and all that heartfelt laughter we hear is testament to that fact. But I guess it's not surprising that someone who sings so gloriously laughs so gloriously also."
3,Barbra in Concert,I was looking for some particular arrangements. This set unfortunately does not contain them! It is a good CD for all Barbra Streisand fans!.
5,BABS IS WELL AND STILL A HEAVY HITTER!!,"Streisand: Live In Concert (2 CD's)Her voice is stronger than ever. She's obviously had work done but still looks like an incredible diva. Surprisingly, her numbers with Il Divo are terrific and they are choreographed so she is like a Greek goddess and they are her chorus. It's also nice she does old songs from ""Funny Girl"" that she has never performed in concert before. A must have CD set at any price."
3,"Starting Here, Ending HereLeave","Leave it to the legendary Babs to FINALLY get over her stage fright, let go of her perfectionism, and tour just in time to have 100's of thousands of fans in 7 countries witness the shockingly bad and deteriorated voice of the century. I saw two of the shows LIVE and have no desire to relive the disappointment on DVD. How I long for the 'old Barbra' and her perfectionaism and genius. I don't mean to be so critical of my all-time favorite vocalist and entertainer; but getting old really sux."
5,Like Buttah!,Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!
3,Babs is good but not as powerful,"This cd set reveals a hoarse sounding Streisand that sings sincerely-but has finally lost that crystal siren of a voice.She sounds different as a mature live performer,and I kept longing to hear that sonic instrument that has lost it's primal power.It is enjoyable and good-but not the songstress we once knew.I'm suprised that the diva didn't play with the sonics more in the studio-and that is refreshing.She has allowed her human frailty to be exposed.Yes she is a multi talented woman."
5,Streisand: Live in Concert (2 CD's),This is one of the best CD's of all her concerts. I was lucky enough to go to her concert in Los Angeles and it was fantastic. The CD makes you feel as if you are there listening to her wonderful voice. ILDivo performs and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a Streisand fan.
1,Stainless Steel Outside - All Plastic inside!!,"This is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. If you're chosing this because you no longer want your food and beverages exposed to plastic, you might want to stay away from this one. The inside area is made entirely of black plastic. However, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.I am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. This listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers. I returned my canister with my explanation that the quality was not as represented. I don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. Amazon rocks but this listing needs help!"
2,Too Small,Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.
4,pretty with flaws,good looking but the canister is difficult to re-seal when closing. The top doesn't seat comfortably on the base without some coaxing. Only size coffee filters that fit in the canister is a size 4.
1,Costs $10.89 at Target online,Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one.
5,A pocket encyclopedia of writing style,"Bring your style reference everywhere you write. An unbeatable classic. Every time I open it up, I find something to use in what I'm working on."
1,misleading cd,This is not Lighthouse. This is the ST Luke UMC Lighthouse Praise Band. I am returning it to Amazon because it looks like Chrstian filler.
1,Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!,"Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter..."
1,Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware,"Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift."
1,Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you.,"This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday. This piece of garbage cannot, does not, and will not stand up. And it does not stay together. And the elevator breaks easily. And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices."
1,Don't waste your money,"This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
2,misleading photo,"There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the ""too good to be true"" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK!,"Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."
1,Not for children to PLAY with!,"This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!"
1,Garbage!,"My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money."
1,Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend!,"I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately! I may have to glue the parts together just so he could play with it some more time before we dump it.Do not recommend!"
2,Not very durable,"This toy was a pain to put together, and even worse to stay together. The elevator won't work, and I had to forcefully put some of the pieces together. Most people who reviewed this toy, had the same complaints, but I bought it anyway, because my nephew really wanted it. I'm glad that I only paid $15.00 for it, because it's not worth any more than that. Some pieces came off, before my nephew even got a chance to play with it."
2,A nice showpiece but falls apart with the slightest touch!,"What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. They're colorful, durable, playable, and collectible. The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it. If you have small children avoid this at all cost and save your $35."
2,"Son loves it, but it does fall apart","My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. It has fallen apart each time he plays with it and has fallen on him a couple of times, so if you have a small child, I wouldn't recommend it.I will attempt to GLUE the legs on, since they are the biggest problem for this toy. Everything else works just great. Elevator, noises, guns, etc."
1,Another lame mattel product,Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.
1,Watchtower is total crap!!,Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off.
1,What a waste!,After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.
5,OMG.....THIS FILM IS SOOOO WORTH UR $$$,"I, personally, am not a lesbian. I would recommend this movie to any of the ""GaY Phobia"" people. The fact that Mirren turns out to be a lesbian has no baring on the emotions you will express while watching this film. It has a wonderful cast of characters and exceptional use of words. I would recommend this to anyone 13 yrs or older, of any gender, and any sexual prefrence."
5,Great monitor!,"I've been using this monitor for about 2 weeks now. Easy to set up, works great! No dead pixels. I'm using the analog input for my old PC and the DVI input for me new PC. Even my 7 year old PC looks great on this using the analog input! Minor complaint: have to hit a few menu buttons to toggle between analog and DVI inputs, wish there was a toggle button so it could be done in a single push. Haven't used the built-in speakers yet. The monitor tilts up and down just fine. Overall, great monitor!"
1,I am returning it today....,"I bought this from frys and am returning it today. Maybe it's only me, but mine had really bad quality and distorted images. I had 17"" LCD monitor from viewsonic and was replacing it because it has similar problem. Now, 19"" has same problem and I am done with viewsonic. I am not going to use viewsonic monitors again. Instead, I am going to try samsung ones."
2,Not sure that this is a great product .,"The thing is I like the display and everything , but the first monitor when I got had a bad pixel in the middle . So I understand it happens , return it and got another one same model . Two days later the same thing happen , and two more days I got one more bad pixel . So I am returning this one as well ,but no exchange this time . Just not worth it . Plus you can not adjust it , it stays only in one position .It may not happen anything with this bad pixels , but I don't want to take a chance . It's a hassle ."
4,Works great but ...,"I purchased this charger along with the ""Ericsson 1200 mAh Extended Battery"" for my LX588. I had to return the battery because it does not fit in either of the two slots provided by this charger. Don't get this charger with the larger 1200mAh Ericsson battery. BTW, the Charger works great with regular sized Ericsson batteries. I like the discharge feature in the back slot."
2,Confused,"I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first."
3,Fun Read,"Fun read! Not as good as Madeleine Wickhams alter ego Sophie Kinsella's ""Shopaholic"" books, but fun nonetheless. If you are looking for a book to read to pass the time, this book is for you. Not exceptionally entertaining but it will do the trick."
3,Stirred Not Shaken...,"I would have given this 4 stars had it not been for one irksome character by the name of Candice. It was just too far fetched for me, how could a person be so naive to an outsider and yet hold down a job as a prolific writer in a popular magazine?!!! This sub-plot simply jars the whole story.Apart from Candice, Maggie & Roxanne form the more believable duo of the trio of girlfriends cum colleagues who meet for cocktails once a month. Maggie's account of coping with motherhood is very intense and moving. Roxanne's affair with a much older married man is very much a dead end and quite cliched.All in all, a readable story about the bonds of friendship and how misunderstandings can be overcome."
2,"No Cocktails For Me, Thanks","I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books and her writing style...but this book was awful. The story line was predictable and the writing flat and unoriginal. Makes you wonder if this was truly written by Kinsella or a way for a ghost writer to get started under her 'new' pen name. I don't plan on buying anymore Madeline Wickham books--stick to the original Kinsella, where I haven't been disappointed yet."
3,Too many characters?,"I have read all of the books written by ""Sophie Kinsella"" and absolutely love them. This one was hard for me to get into. I didn't feel that connection to any of the three main characters like I have with characters in her other books. I usually end each book wanting more of the main characters, but this one didn't leave that impression. All in all it was a good read, just not my favorite."
2,Where is her tell-tale wit?!,"I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all."
3,Better than I thought!,"They say not to judge a book by its cover, and its true. When this book arrived I thought the cover looked kind of cheesy and I'd wondered if I'd made a mistake. But the story was actually smart, clever and full of surprised and I turned out to be very pleased! The friends in the story reminded me of my own girlfriends, how we are all so different now that we've grown up - yet all good friends still. Wickham also did a good job of really making you start to despise the antagonist."
3,Lukewarm,"This book was ok but not anywhere near the league of a Rosamunde Pilcher book. But since I have read all of Pilcher's books multiple times and wanted something new to read, I tried this. The plot was nicely developed but Wickham pretty much tells you everything that is going to happen right up front, thus taking away any delicious suspense. The writing is easy to read but lacks the coziness of Pilcher's books."
2,Boring...,I couldn't get into this one. I felt the story was lacking and dragging on. I didn't get through half of it before I gave up.
5,Surprised,This is my first Madeleine Wickham's book that I have read and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was! It was a slow start but once I got into it I couldn't put it down!!! I will definitely read more of her books!!!
4,Relaxing,A very light and enjoyable read!! I love books by Madeline Wickham and can't wait to read more of them.
5,LOVED IT!,"I must say that I was very impressed with ""Cocktails for Three!"".You read about the tales of 3 best friends who meet at a Manhattan Bar the same night every month. They get to catch up on everything that is going on with their lives.Maggie is pregnant. Roxanne has been dating a married man for 6 years. Candice has such a warm heart and can't seem to say ""NO.""The end of the book will throw you for a loop. As other reviews have said, you will not see it coming.This book kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next to the (3) characters. I am sure that you will be able to identify a personal friend of yours for Maggie, Roxanne and Candice. I was able to finish in just (1) day which is rare for me.I can't wait to check out Wickman's other two books.Enjoy!"
2,A Little Disappointing,"I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much."
1,Hated it so much I returned it,"I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."
3,A good summer read for the beach or pool,"Didn't like this book as much as Kinsella's (aka Wickham) other books, but found it an entertaining book for beach-side or pool-side reading for sure. Reading this book was kind of like eating a whole box of chocolates--fun during the process, a guilty pleasure, but ultimately not completely satisfying. It was a little predictable, but fun.My favorite character was Maggie, a new mother who is utterly competent in the workplace, but finds herself at odds with being a first-time parent. I think the Maggie's struggles are something all new moms will sympathize with...I also thought the other three characters were entertaining. Buy it used, but don't pay full price for this one. Kinsella's other books would be more worthy of the price tag for a new book (i.e. Undomestic Godess, Shopaholic series)."
3,The Dark Side of Sophia Kinsella,"I'm a diehard fan of Sophie Kinsella's chick-lit titles but I have to say that I agree with fellow reviewers who compared this one negatively. Although she poignantly captured the angst that modern women go through in their choices about careers, romance and childbearing, there was a repetitious thread throughout the chapters that became tedious and, further, lacked the wit and humor this author is so loved for. The lack-lustre resolution to the Heather spin was also disappointing. Had I been penning this story myself, I would have ended it with Maggie's husband and meddling mother-in-law hiring the perfect nanny behind Maggie's back when she returns to work - and having that person be none other than Heather.Christina HamlettAuthor of A Bel Air Lawyer in King Henry's Court"
2,Skip it,"Three ladies who make sure to have a meeting of the minds every month. The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass."
4,Entertaining read,"I read this book because Wickham also writes under the pseudonym of Sophie Kinsella, the author of the Shopoholic books, of which I'm a fan. Cocktails is a great book, very funny but also poignant. It has quite a bit more depth than the Shopoholic series and some of Kinsella's other materials. The characters in Cocktails are well developed, though the plot for Candice at times seemed a bit contrived. Overall, this is a great and entertaining book."
3,Book I purchased,It is not the issue I thought it was going to be and I can't see that it is the latest issue which I thought I was getting.
1,Very poor condition BUT? Good read!,"I saw D. Ebby 35 years ago on the 700 Club, wanted this book for all those years. It was brought to my attention by another minister of the gospel just recently. Saw it on Amazon and decided to buy it, it was inexpensive. The pages fell apart as I read the book, it was extremely frustrating but? So enjoyable and encouraging, I was glad I bought it. I am going to look for the same book in better condition, just to reread or give to another to enjoy."
3,Title is misleading,"I enjoyed the book, but bought it basically for the title, and there was only 1 or 2 chapters dedicated to his acual near death experience. Might have been more aptly titled the Life of Dr Eby."
3,A tad bit disappointing,"There is no doubt that ""Romeo and Juliet"" is a classic love and war tragedy that is one of the best ever. However, so many films and other stories have watered down the book, and once you see enough adaptations, you've had enough. This is a little out dated as far as dialogue is concerned, but this is a Shakespeare play I'm talking about. Too much time is taken betwwen the action scenes, but the ending is amazing. However, it's not enough to save this book from an average rating."
3,Descent but far from his best play,"I'm sorry, but I really don't find why this book is considered one of Shakesperre's best. I hate the character of Romeo personally. It is a bit soap operish. If you're looking for a true work of his read MacBeth or Hamlet. This is far far far from his best."
5,My Favorite Shakespeare,"The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."
4,Very good presentation of Romeo and Juliet,I enjoyed this presentation of Romeo and Juliet. It has been a challenge to find supplimental material to help my students understand and appreciate the drama and humor in this fine work of art. I often begin with an adapted version of the tale for my young readers. Visit [...] to review. L Heflick
3,Not impressed with this Arden version,"This is obviously not a review of the play itself since the play gets 5 stars whether you like it or not (I happen to over the years come to like it less and less but it is nonetheless one of Shakespeare's greatest and best-known plays). The Arden editions came highly recommended to me by someone who has a Master's degree in Shakespearean literature. Yet, I was very unimpressed with the version. In fact, I found it more difficult to read than the less-well respected Folger's edition and I went back to the Folger's edition. I didn't find any of the added material contributed anything to my further knowledge or understanding of the play and it actually made it more difficult to follow the play to the point where I just stopped reading this edition and went back to the Folger's, which at least is easier to read straight through."
3,Friar Lawrence needs to be de-frocked,"The strengths of this famous play are the adorable and intelligent Juliet and Shakespeare's romantic language. The weaknesses are, for me, that the ending really sucks and that the unsuccessful plan of Friar Lawrence is just so stupid. His plan is to make a drugged zombie out of Juliet to convince her parents that she is dead. Would your priest, minister or rabbi suggest that?Friar Lawrence lacks courage and intelligence. He consents to marry the lovers without their parents' consent, but he doesn't have the backbone to tell the parents what he did. What in God's name is that about? And he comes up with an idiotic plan to deceive the parents. Where did he learn to be a religious guide to others? His stupidity and deceitfulness are matched only by his cowardice.The beauty of the language, and Juliet's wonderful character in the play, call for 5 stars. But the utter stupidity of the script and the horrible ending drag it down."
2,Disappointed,I bought this for the Kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews. I am very disappointed because that is the only reason I purchased this book. They should not use printed version reviews for Kindle books.
4,Not my favorite,"This isn't my favorite of all of Shakespeare's stuff. First of all, Mercutio is the best character, and he dies too soon. Second, I didn't really like Romeo and Juliet enough to care a lot when they died.As for all the metaphors and allusions packed in, that's always interesting. I think people start Shakespeare with this play, because it's not as difficult as the other tragedies, which I suppose is a good idea. After this, go to Macbeth (the best!)."
2,Never got here.,"I can't review this item because it never made it to me. I received an email a few days later saying the money would be credited back to me (which it was). However, I have never had a problem with receiving shipments at my address. The seller claimed that my address was not found. I received something from a different seller just 2 days before though. I am not sure what address they tried to send it to, but it was not the one I gave. Unfortunately I had to find this book somewhere else. The book is a great find, however, and I am very pleased with it."
5,True Love,"The play's setting is the Italian city of Verona where Romeo and Juliet, the star-crossed lovers, face authorianism with a blood feud between each other's family, the Montegues and the Capulets. At a feast, Romeo notices and is struck by Juliet's beauty. At the first opportunity he approaches her; they fall in love immediately. Only after parting do they learn that they belong to rival families. The two exchange vows and decide to marry the next day, expecting that they will bring peace to the feuding families. Many deaths resulted from this relationship. Romeo and Juliet is one of the best romantic stories in history which motivated many people to rethink hatred against one another. It captures the essence of true love."
3,I really liked this book.,I love this book I could read iut over and over agni it even has more then the movie dose so you understand and learn more.
4,Kindle Reader Considerations,"The classic Romeo and Juliet. Wonderful book, wonderful read.Kindle users: This book seems to not be typed out for the Kindle. Instead, it's a bunch of pictures of the text. This results in disjointed annotations and an inability to select a word on the screen and pop it up to the dictionary."
2,Shakespeare,"As we all have one time or another, had to read shakespeare in school for English class. That was my reason for this, my son needed it for school. I'm just glad it was available. He needed to Kill a Mokingbird, it wasn't available for Kindle."
5,this book makes it very easy to understand the writing in this book.,this book makes it so much easier to understand the context of this book. there are definitions of some of the words that are almost impossible to understand. there are character explainations as well. very good version for a student!
2,wrong cover,"I guess maybe it said they have the right to change the cover, but the one we received was completely different! Looked like an old Harlequin romance novel.... also the book had people reviewing it along with the text and my daughter didnt like that format."
2,Not new as stated,"This product was shipped to me in a reasonable time, but the description said it was new when it had been annotated and highlighted throughout the book. I was disappointed with this since I wanted a new version of this book."
3,This version wasn't what I was looking for,"It didn't have the exact format I needed to read in class, liek act, line number,and I have to order a different version of the play...."
2,notes are not on the left page - get the other version,"There are 2 versions of this book available on Amazon. The other version looks identical in the picture but if you look inside, it isn't. This one does not have the ""translation"" of Shakespeare on the left page, which is what most high school students need. If you want the notes, get the other book."
3,Romeo & Juliet,"In my opinion, this book is not adaptable for kids because it shows the difficult and dramatic situation between Romeo and Juliet, and because there are a lot of battles were there is a lot of blood, that are not for kids.It tells that Romeo and Juliet cannot be together because their families were in a feud. Juliet's mother wants her to marry a man that is called Paris. In the other side Romeo had to kill a man called Tybalt, Juliet's cousin, because he wanted to kill Romeo. So Romeo had to escape to Mantua. Finally Juliet lies that she is dead so Romeo goes to see Juliet's body but before he had to kill Paris. After that he committed suicide and Juliet too.In conclusion I like it but it's obvious that children are going to read it."
5,Best play ever!,"This is definitely the best play of all time! If you have never read it, then you should as soon as possible!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. In reality it starts and ends directly with the play. No prologue, introduction or anything else. The reviews don't correspond to the item being sold."
2,Not Impressed,"This book does not have line numbers. In addition, the pages don't have the scene or act number on them. So when you open up the book, you have no idea where you are in the play. You have to flip through pages and find the closest scene 1 so you can figure out which act you are in and then go from there. This book makes it difficult to follow with others in class and I would not recommend it to anyone."
4,worth it,"This edition of romeo and juliet is worth getting and the annotations are very helpful. I am one of those readers that likes everything annotated so if you aren't don't get this one. The notes were excellent, helpful, and so was the introduction. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
2,Very difficult to hear,"If you are a teacher, I would look into buying another audio version of Romeo and Juliet. I have been using it as a tool to get the students to hear professional actors and to then ask them to use the same skills those professional actors use (inflection, emphasis, etc.) The problem is it is VERY difficult to hear...to the point that you have to sit 3 feet away to hear it at times. This simply does not work for a classroom."
2,Oh Romeo,Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.
1,stupid student review by gabriel c,Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.
1,the movie was better,"i just read this book. everybody like always talks about how great it is and everything. but i don't think so. like, it's been done before, right?? soooo cliched. omg."
1,Misrepresented,"The customer reviews for this edition of Romeo and Juliet indicated that it was dual language, i.e., the original Shakespeare on one side of the pages and a modern ""translation"" on the other. This edition was original text only -- fine for what it is, but not what we wanted."
2,Basic Romeo and Juliet,"I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the eBook--readability, layout, price, and other features.This 99 cent version is very basic. It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations. The layout does maintain the iambic pentameter poetry, but the text appears crowded on the page as there is no line break or spacing between speakers.At 99 cents, this version is not bad; however, there are better, equally inexpensive versions."
4,Well worth the money.,"Romeo and Juliet does not read as well as some other plays such as Hamlet. It must be seen to be fully enjoyed. Nevertheless, I would reccomend this edition of the play. It is dirt cheap, for the amount of content you recieve, it is well worth the money. I reccomended it, however I strongly suggest you watch the play first before reading it. I believe that only after you watch the play will you fully appreciate it."
4,I don't know,I don't know want the book is about yet Hahaha so can I read now? Thank you ? This is I don't know
5,A Old Novel,It a old novel but a good one that u can more then one time. A lot school use it for English reading.
5,Shakespeare&#65533;s books are complicated and awful!,"The first time I read one of Shakespeare book was at school, I thought is was going to be amazing because he is one of the most recognised writers in history. But I couldn't understand anything; it has a very old and complicated language that young people can't understand well enough. I think that all that style is very complex for us, older people could understand it well and enjoy it. But in that case I would only recommend it to women, I really don't think men will like all that kind of love stories as this one, where two people are strongly in love and that is a forbidden one by their families. I recognise that is has a very good ending but that's all. This is my personal opinion, you may like it. I have my respect for William Shakespeare but I think he is awful."
4,...MaGicaL...,"Books by Shakespere is something you just don't read for fun, you read it slowly by savoring the moments of every word spoken by each character. By reading Romeo and Juliet, you would understand the tragidy because of love...and how they both would risk their lives for each other. Shakespere is the man who can really define true love."
1,Gimmie A Break!,"Not that I don't like Shakespeare's works, but his tragedies are terrible, especially this one. I can't understand the language real well, so I have to grab one with the contemporary language so that it'll be easier to understand. I just can't understand this love tragedy at all! Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much. It's ridiculous! If you want a true love story, try reading ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". This one absolutely SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Romeo and Juliet- a love story,"I have read this book, and I also saw the video. This story helps us to realise what real love meant at that time and it taught us a new difficult language which we didn't know. It was a very detailed story and full of love and hate.This story is about an impossible love which finished killing the two main characters, Romeo and Juliet. This shows that at that time men were very sexist and selfish and that woman was treated very badly. This story made me feel sad and at the same time angry because it was unfair what both families did to them.In conclusion we appreciated very much this book and we learnt a lot about it, especially about love and hate among people. Another thing that we learnt was that the inside of a person is what counts and not the physical appearance.Julia and Jesica"
2,Getting old,"This may be one of the great works of humanity, but it just doesn't cut it for me. The gender sterotypes are nauseating, to say the least. Though required in schools, this book is nnot one of the bests to read on your own time. Or maybe I am just disillussioned."
2,i didnt understand,"I bought this book hoping it could help me understand shakespeare's words better, but it didnt. Instead I had to look up every other word in a dictionary or sometimes even online. Soon it just got so hectic that i just threw the book out and bought a better more reliable source."
5,Great book,This book not only a classic but a real journey(not really but just saying) the only thing I dislike about this book is the names at the sides. If you are looking for a script this is the best thing told use. Plus at the book defines some uncommon words with numbers beside them that are defined in the next page. A true five star book!
5,An Amazing Compilation,I stumbled upon this set one day at a store and I initially purchased it based on some of the familiar artists on the track listing. What I had purchased turned out to be probably the best compilation of downtempo music I've ever heard. From start to finish on both discs I can't turn it off. If you're not enjoying it directly the compilation makes for excellent background music if you're having friends over to enjoy some drinks. I recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of downtempo music.
2,"Very mediocre, middle of the road collection","That sums up this collection well. It's put out by Club Med and, perhaps that says something is some people's minds. What it amounts to is a fairly non-offensive collection of big-name artists (Kool and The Gang, Wes Montgomery, Roy Ayers, Sweetback - of Sade fame) doing downtempo. Think of it as muzak that is likely played at Club Med resorts or Sandals resorts to vacationers who find Club Med still suitable (as if it somehow ever was). South Beach, Monaco, Cannes sur Mer or St. Tropez discrimnating tastes this is not.I will say that it does have packaging and style over substance, but beyond that, there are far superior products out there, literally for a fraction of the cost. Avoid this unless you have absolutely everything else in your collection and far nothing better to listen to (which I doubt)."
3,Respectable Overview of a Remarkable Career,"Legacy's Essential series has finally gotten around to releasing a collection on country queen Dolly Parton. The track listing features songs from Parton's early 1960's recordings all the way up to Dolly's 2001 Grammy winning reading of Collective Soul's song ""Shine"". The sound on this collection is at it's very best due to the remastering of all of the tracks.Hopefully some other jewels from Dolly's time with BMG, Legacy's parent company, will be reissued by the label in their original form. Parton has a very rich catalog of recorded music, most of which is long out of print and needs to be reissued for a whole new generation to discover and enjoy.If you are a new Dolly fan, then this is the collection for you. Long time fans are still longing for the early 1970's Dolly albums to be reissued and will probably already own the recordings featured on this CD."
5,Was great shape.,Like new just little wear around the edges the binding does not have a crease and pages are cripse. Over all I'm very happy.
2,"Very Thorough, yet Tough to Read","Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."
1,Good book -- but not this edition,"This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version."
1,copy shop edition,"The stars are for the edition, not the book.The April 30, 2011 edition from CreateSpace (which probably actually is a copy shop) does not look like a book. It looks like a leaflet from Jehova's witnesses. It's flimsy, in a weird large format, and with no information about publisher, date of publishing etc. If you have any aesthetic sensibility you should get a different edition of this classic book.This type of product should either come with a warning ""not a real book"" or not be sold on amazon at all."
3,"Good Book, Bad Edition","The great Victorian book about what we now call central banking really needs to introduction. It is every bit as brilliant and relevant as it was when written, a century and a half ago.This edition, however is sub-par, to say the list. Clearly no one proofed the text, and it has about five of six glaring cases of bad or missing punctuation per page, not to mention typos.In short, go get another edition of the book."
1,Binge: British Light Music,"Never ordered it, it was sent by mistake and I returned it upon receipt without even opening it so I don't know."
1,Would rather watch grass grow,"I have seen many many movies in my life and this one takes the cake as being the biggest waste of time, terrible film I have EVER seen. Honestly, to think someone actually made this movie makes me believe anyone can make a movie. Everything about this movie is just so bad it makes me want to vomit."
4,Good movie for what it is!,"For what it is,Flesh Wounds is a good movie,although I can see the comparisons to Predator. Kevin Sorbo does a good job of playing Lt.Tyler,comannder of a special ops force. As is usually the case in Sorbo's movies,there is a pretty woman,who,through no fault of her own,causes more trouble than the team really needs,but eventually earns their trust. They soon discover that their real enemy is something created by their own government-the perfect soldier,part man and part machine,who has lost control. With time running out,it's either kill or be killed,and Lt.Tyler much prefers the former. If you like action-adverneture films,this may be one movie you will want to check out!"
1,15 Minutes of Cable Access Style Bio,"If you want a low-tech, outdated, poorly produced micro-biography of Ralph Ellison that runs about 15 minutes (that's right--ignore the time posted above because it certainly isn't 30), then this may be what you are looking for."
1,Protect a bed mattress cover,"I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing."
5,Fabulous,I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.
3,kinda cheap,"The dress was made of poor materials, but ok for what I needed it for. If you are looking for something that is upscale forget about it."
2,"Cute, But a Little Cheap...","This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better."
1,Not cut well,"This costume is poorly cut. Areas through the bust/underarms bunch up and won't lay flat. I have an average build -- not flat, and not busty (35 B/C). I ordered an XS. But while the waist fit, the bust area was tight and dug into the underarms."
4,satisfied,he enjoyed it. will recommend it to friends to order form this site. It is cost friendly and you save
2,Cheap,"This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night."
2,Cheap Quality,"Not as described, the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin. Was dissapointed of the quality and packaging."
1,Earring case,Unable to use. Compartments too tiny and too deep to reach in to get earrings - and I don't have unusually large fingers.
1,Wish I could Order this Item,"I could really use this Item but I won't order it if I cannot order the color that I want; guess I'll have to look elsewhere.....sorry, this company seems to be losing a lot of sales with the 'let us choose for you' policy."
1,Another Lost Sale,"I too was ready to buy this product, but will not do it if I can't get the color I choose. I guess this company doesn't want to put their customers first!"
1,"no color choice, no buy","I want a specific color, not a random one. Thanks to the reviews, I won't be buying this one either !"
3,Just OK,"Look good from the start. No choice of colors, I ordered 4 & all came in black. After a while the insides move & the earrings slip around."
1,Locking Earring Case,"I want to buy this product, but I want it in Black.....Why should I allow you to choose the color when I'm paying."
1,"Folks...if you offer various color pictures for item, then offer the color choice for sale!","Ok...ditto to all the other comments. I have searched all over for days for a blue jewelry earring / ring box for my 87 yr. old mom for Christmas. I am set to order it, then see you can't choose a color. What a big waste of my time and effort. This was just what I was looking for and no color choice. How dumb is that!"
1,Poor option,Why would someone pay for what they cannot have? Let the customer choose the color of the product they want to purchase!
1,What...?,"When I first bought this it was because of the song ""oh, Yeah"" granted I heard the rest of the album and there were a lot better songs and I loved the eclectic sound. ""Love Devine"" sung by the women who sang the James Bond theme song ""Goldfinger"" was ultra cool. So they remaster it with all these bonus tracks but no ""Oh Yeah""? That totally sucks. It's not the best song on it but it's not ""One Second"" without ""Oh,Yeah"""
5,breathtaking,"Even though, this album was not critics' favorite, give it a try. You'll be mesmerized! Its pulsating hypnotic melodies will drive you to the ecstasy and force you to listen to it again and again. I must admit that by being Yello's fan I can not be very objective in describing their work. But after so many years since I've heard album for the first time and after so many changes in my personal taste in the popular music, it is still one of my favorites. It is quite simply THE BEST CD TO LISTEN IN THE CAR by any artist. And hey, if all you know about Yello is infamous OH YEAH, consider this: it is not even in the best five of this album. What can I say more! Enjoy."
5,Consecrated Masterpiece.,"I got goosebumps in 1987 the first time I heard Dr. Van Steiner @ 1'26"", still today in 2011 the same.Let me take this CD to heaven."
4,Office Decor,Loved the show and use classic movie and TV memorabilia to decorate my home office. Wish I could find posters.
5,Another Roundup of His Classics,"If you're a long time Jobim fan (or just a fan of music) - you'll have all these tracks scattered across various CD's and LP's - if you want a roundup of his some of his greatest romantic/chill/ lounge and quiet bossa tracks - this is really another greatest hits package. The version of DINDI is backed by Astrud Gilberto. Elis Regina joins him on a couple tracks also. For longtime fans who might want a convenient CD to put in the car or have ready a romantic evening CD with his ""quiet"" classics, no reason not to add this to your collection. For new fans, this is a great starter CD but you'll be buying many more of Jobim's - no reason not to start with this one :-)"
2,1962 version bothered me,"I have several fetal development books now, but this one is the only one I couldn't stand to keep. I tore out a few of the best pictures and threw the rest of the book away. I had the 1962 version, so I can't speak for any other editions. It explains in the book that the picture sequences documenting the development of movement were of babies born very early, as early as the 6th week. I don't believe they were aborted on purpose or anything, but I couldn't stand to see how they were being touched with a hair to see how they move... that seems cruel to me. That sort of thing is not what I want to see when I'm expecting! The authors other book, Beginning Life is much, much better. It has better pictures and is more sensitive to the well-being of the pictured fetuses."
1,"I did not give it a good review at first however, they promised but did not deliver my money back.",I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it.
1,A bit disappointed,"While there were some nice pictures and helpful information I was abit disappointed with the book in general. It was short (92 pages of large text),with no color pictures and just didn't seem like that helpful of a book for a first time mother. The book was first published in 1962 with an update in 1982 and I'm sure there have been quite a few new discoveries that would be quite informative for a first time mother since then. I felt like I was reading a high school biology book. OK for what it was but I'd not recommend it."
3,first release of this cd,"this was the first release of this cd and it has more tracks. Only 11 are boc tracks. And two of those songs are solid boc tracks that rock. The others are instrumental tracks basically , plus you get some other bands from the movie. Bad channels was a low budget sci fi flick. But at this point boc needed to crack down and make a melodic hard rock cd. But at least we got this one back in 92. It's for boc completists certainly. the songs are good boc songs and the rest are ok.Still if you want a real boc cd buy 'fire of unknown origin"" then get this to complete your boc collection. because they are a great band! and they make great music."
4,Informative and entertaining to read,"For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it."
2,Lacking,This book lacks the depth it seems to promise. Some of the illustrations are lacking. There is not enough meat to help anyone with special needs learners. I would suggest you look elsewhere. I was greatly disappointed since the majority of work by Jensen is wonderful.
2,Had to buy this for a class-- not very informative,"The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. It is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know."
4,"Works like it should, but pricey","The cable works perfectly and was obviously professionally made. They worked great for bridging our LIU to our switch across the wall at gigabit speeds, and I would expect much higher if necessary. The price seems to have gone way up since I bought it however, making it not as great of a deal, even with the fast Prime shipping."
5,Excellent Resource on Problem Pregnancy,I have worked in an abortion clinic for over twenty years and Anne Baker's work is required reading for all new counselors on our staff. In addition her book is an excellent resource for the seasoned counselor. Her expertise and sensitivity in dealing with a host of patient issues relating to abortion becomes apparent in the first few pages of this manual. She also manages to provide useful guidelines to help clinic staff deal with the special stresses involved in working in an abortion clinic.
2,too old,Written in 1970's it's really too old to apply to todays lifestyles and trends on fry cookery but it does have some classics. Glad I bought it used-but shipping was more than the price!
4,Except for page 144 an excellent book!,"I really appreciated this book until I got to her views on homosexuality. They so offended me, I almost stopped reading right there. But then, I remembered some of her outdated language and references and checked the copyright date: 1970. So I cut her some slack for her unenlightened viewpoint of homosexuality and read the rest of the book. I'm glad I did.Her outdated view points notwithstanding...this is an excellent book for raising children with confidence and high self esteem. I was looking for something to help me take my vague plans for raising my 10mo son and turn them into something more cohesive. This book said what I was thinking, very concisely. Recommend it."
1,Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population,"Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is ""related to a failure in identification"" and that parents of homosexual children should ""seek professional help at the earliest possible moment"". Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."
2,Disappointed!,"Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? ""Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!""I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!"
4,Helpful even when your baby is little,"Reading this early was a great help to me. My son is still quite young, but I'm already getting good ideas and getting into good habits to help build up his self esteem. This information also makes me feel like a more confident parent."
5,Your child's self esteem,"well, what can i say? i love it because i needed it, i do believe the seller should have given the book more credit, they should have categorized it VERY good, in the ""condition"" it was.. i am more than please, i started reading it for class already and i actually did grow fond of this book its very interesting and filled with knowledge!"
5,Strongly recommend it,"I am half way through the book and am enjoying every page of it. The author seems to be enlightened as well, which makes the read more enjoyable. God bless her soul. My condolensces to her loved ones (she seems to have passed away on Sep 21, 2012)."
2,Bone chilling outdated views,"I was just about to buy this book for my child bearing friend when I saw the outdated view to homosexuality. Pitty. This book is very good in many espects; but in the event of the child or anyone close to the family being homosexual, this will probably result in parent's mishandling of the situation which will perhaps do a good deal of damage to the child's self esteem."
2,VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality,"While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!"
4,Truly in his own Words,"I have read many books on Manson as well as other ""Serial Killers."" There is legitimate debate as to whether or not Manson himself should be lumped into this category. Digression.Of all the books I have read on Manson, surprisingly this one seems the least self-serving. The whole notion of ""Helter Skelter"" (which I honestly believe was preached to his followers, but in actuality was in no way the catalyst for the Tate-LaBianca murders) as being the one and only motive put forth by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi seems to me to be one of the most self-serving.I won't reveal anything too important, but Manson is surprisingly candid in this book and his version seems much more plausible and realisitic than any of the other accounts I have read."
2,A double edged sword,"This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson ""in his own words"" but were nothing more than fabrication."
4,an up-close account of a disturbed and fascinating man,This book began with the childhood of Manson and the numerous institutions he's been in and out of throughout his life. It eliminates hype and sheds light on the truth of the madman behind the mask and gives a personal account of how experiences led him in and out of institutions for the duration of his life.
2,I don't believe Manson had anything to do with this.,"Ok, if your a Manson collector of course you have to have this, but otherwise it is not even a good read, let alone Manson's words.Buy it if you are collecting, but read Helter Skelter or the Family for a better read."
1,totally untrue,"""Charles Manson in Nuell Emmons's Words"" anyone who's seen or heard Manson interviewed, knows his lingo and knows those aren't his words."
1,Fabrication... Squeezing the cash out of MAC...,"I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd"
1,WHAT??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!,"Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!"
2,Manson... in someone else's words,"While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The ""frame"" that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words. Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'."
3,Take with a grain of salt...,"Offers some unique insights nonetheless. No, these are for the most part not Chrles' words, but are they his thoughts?There is some honesty here, but also plenty of omissions, especially regarding Mansons mind-control tactics.Whether intended or not, the portayal of Manson in this book, in my estimation, is that of an idiot and a 3 time loser, who had a way of getting troubled young girls to follow him. The more compelling and interesting parts of his personality (his ability to utterly brainwash a group of people), he utterly refuses to cop to."
5,NOT YOUR TYPICAL CHARLES MANSON/HELTER SKELTER BOOK,MANSON IN HIS OWN WORDS ALLOWS YOU THE READER TO SEE THINGS FROM MANSON'S POINT OF VIEW. I WAS IMPRESSED HOW CHARLES MANSON DID NOT DOWN PLAY HIS ROLE IN ANY OF HIS HORRIBLE CRIMES. HE OWNED UP TO THEM AND REALISTICALLY POINTS OUT HOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CONTENT SPENDING HIS LIFE BEHIND BARS. HE ALSO ALLOWS THE READERS TO SEE HOW THE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE IN FACT RESPONSIBILE FOR THEIR OWN ACTIONS. I'VE READ MANY BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MANSON FAMILY AND I MUST SAY THIS WAS DEFINETELY A WELCOME DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON THE SUBJECT.
4,"Decent first album, though nothing really caught my interest","I LOVE Miss Kittin. That's why I've given her 4 instead of 3. She is completely awesome, and her music rocks. Though in this album. I've listened to it again and again, but I haven't found anything really thrilling on the CD.I mean, I REALLY LOVE MISS KITTIN. My favorite song is ""1982"" which was done with the Hacker on a different CD.The only thing I really have to say about this CD, is that ""Requiem for a Hit"" is one of the better songs on the CD. I don't know, maybe I'm just haven't been in the mood for this type of music as of late, and that's why I can't get into the CD at all. So perhaps, later, I will come back, and edit this review to show that is the most totally awesome thing ever conceived!"
1,Pretentious Drivel,"People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this."
3,"Kinda sucks, but not really","Although I am completely enamoured with Miss Kittin's latest offering, Batbox, which is an excellent album, I find this album a bit annoying: it's hard to listen through all the tracks on one sitting. Lyrics are for the most part superficial and meaningless. No detectable coherence linking the songs together. Probably a good nightclub set, but I like my music for driving and relaxation. It does have the merit of indicating that Miss Kittin, as a developing artist, has dratically improved since I.Com."
4,Left wanting more.,"I have read all three books individually and now the compendium. All I can think of is a line from Oliver Twist...""more, please.""Dahak and Colin I are among the best heroes on the market."
3,"Strange, it reminded me other books...","1st book looks much like David's own ""Apocalipse Troll"", 2nd reminds John Ringo's Posleen War (centauroid aliens, which were tinkered, and which kill any other species?), 3rd is hybrid between few assasination plots from Honorverse (religious power-hungry fanatics being used by someone else...?) and John Ringo's Prince Roger series(heir of Empire landing on technologically inferior world...?).Don't know who took from whom (and of course it's Ok to rework your own ideas) and may be it is because,unfortunately, I've read other books prior to this one, but I not so enjoyed..."
2,Cheating,"David Weber uses a trick in this book that I think is cheating at writing, and not in a good way. One chapter ends with the main characters in dire straits, and then the next one starts with them having overcome the problem without any explanation. Did he get tired of writing or is he just inept?Otherwise I'd say that I would recommend the book to readers age 12-16. To an adult the characters seems a trifle ""fantastic""."
4,Fun but feels like an outline,"While I couldn't put it down - I feel like I just finished a LONG outline. Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say ""what if"".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore. This could have been a framework for a whole series of books in the hands of another author, perhaps delving deeper into the characters and the worlds. But I certainly appreciate the classic scifi visions."
5,Great Ep,"this rocks they are right now one of the best bands out. Mirror Spirit is one of the best songs to come out in a long time. The only band out that is better then these guys right now is silvertide, and possibly Rose Hill Drive. Sounds like classic 70's 60's rock and roll. The singer has a great voice, I believe his name is Eric Shea and there lead guitarist is a girl but she can really play. Expect to see these guys again because this completly rocks out. Rock and Roll is here to Stay.down below is a list of all the bands true rock fans should check out. New bands here to save the scene.The DarknessJetHurricane PartyParchman Farm (Only have an ep out but it rocks and you can find it here on amazon.)Rose Hill Drive ( have an ep out but not on amazon. They toured with Van Halen and completly rock and the guitarist is incredible.)SupagroupTokyo DragonsYoung Heart AttackBlack Keysand the best new band Silvertide"
4,the best,"Parchman Farm are a new band from San Francisco. They are named after a Paul Butterfield Blues Band song. They remind me of a lot of bands who were in father's record collection like Blue Cheer and Steppenwolf. Many of the Parchman Farm songs seem like they could co-exist somewhere on the Easy Rider soundtrack. The song ""Mirror Spirit"" alternates between soft nice sounds and heavy rock. ""Too Many People"" sounds like Deep Purple at their best, not that there are keyboards on this record. Songs like ""Say Yeah"" are appealing because of the heavy riffs and the cool vocals. This is a pretty interesting record. I could believe that it was recorded in 1968, and not last year. This is a recording that makes you think you can time trip back in time."
1,huh?,"Why would I choose to listen to this when I already own every Black Sabbath album, and every Blue Chear album? I mean-it sounds like a cover band pretty much. But they will fare well in a music industry that does not favor creativity over a fashionable rehash. Such is life."
1,"CURVED, NOT STRAIGHT","I bought these Trim Toenail Clippers because of ""NJMOM's Review"" above. NJMOM stated these clippers are ""STRAIGHT"" not ""CURVED"", WRONG, these clippers are CURVED! I emailed Farm & Home Supply Center for a ""RGA Number"" to return these clippers and never got one. I'll keep them but I'm not happy.If you want a straight cutting blade toenail clipper, these are not the ones. Get the Tweeezerman ones."
4,The Album Is OK!,"The album Trouble, by Akon, is a very good album, if your in the right mood, like songs like Locked Up An Lonly are sad and depressing where as Belly Dancer and Show Out and Trouble Nobody are more up beat. Whatever mood your in, Akon's Trouble matches it!"
2,FRUSTRATED!,I had TWO of these products sent to me and BOTH of them were inoperatable and the packaging on one of them was open...ughhhh...VERY disappointed not to mention frustrated!
5,Comfort,"This earset must be tried; it is nothing like what you used as a kid. It fits well, is light and guess what - no hands!"
2,Thoughts on A Modern Magician,Sadly both A Modern Magician & it's sequel A Calculated Magic have not aged well. They both feel very 80's
3,synth pop para ti,"If you like Erasure, Pet Shop Boys or Depeche Mode, then you should like this. Very synthy this group and I think their goal is to continue to make 80s synthy music."
1,Pet Groomer,I believe the pet groomer would be better if it were smaller as it is difficult to hold. The pin brush head bristles are too hard. The large head makes the suction too strong for my dogs comfort. (I have 8 dogs from 10# to 90#)
3,still worth a look,"While the killer in this plot has gotten himself a little confused between 'The Lipstick Killer' and 'The Zodiac', he seems to be the only character with a defined direction. Belushi, obviously out of his comfort zone, plays the kind of detective you pray will never be investigating your murder unless your goal is to be an unsolved mystery! Bracco on the other hand does seem to understand her character, unfortunately not how to play her.The plot is totally predictable if you can manage to stay focused on it, but still mildly entertaining if you can ignore the bad casting decisions. With that said, it's one beacon of light comes from the highly underrated Faye Grant whos role is far too small to save the movie as a whole. Perhaps in Bracco's role we'd have a whole new ballgame!If you're looking for a steamy, edge of your seat thriller, keep looking, but if you just want a little diversion from reality for awhile, let Faye Grant show you how to steal a scene with this one!"
2,nothing new and not a lot of meat,There isn't anything new to be found in this text that hasn't been covered more thoroughly in other texts. The topics covered seemed glossed over without any meat or substance. Skip this one for more up to date books.
4,Practicioners of both JKD and Wing Chun,"Me, myself being a practicioner of both JKD and Wing Chun Kung Fu found this book to be interesting. It shows you how Bruce Lee used his Wing Chun knowledge and skill to be the basis of Jeet Kune Do. This book also shows how both Wing Chun and Jeet Kune Do would handle the same situations.In my personal opinion Jeet Kune Do is much more simpler, direct and practical in terms of hand-to-hand combat, but where Jeet Kune Do is rooted from should not be overlooked."
4,Good read!,"Good read featuring two renowned Sifus, on two very important Martial Art Sysstems.Bruce Lee, JKD, or WC fans should enjoy this book!"
4,I am satisfied.,I am satisfied with this book about basic of wing chun and comparation with jeet kun do.I recomend this book as introduce into wing chun and jeet kun do.
2,REALLY CMON NOW LETS GET REAL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said ""man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system"" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,very poor,would not buy it.Not worth the money.Did not tell me all the things that I could see in the cities.Would not recommend to anyone.
4,WOW!,"This story blew me away. I thought it was going to be another one of those hair books where the women sit around in a beauty salon gossiping, but it wasn't. It was a sweet and touching story about a woman who wanted to be married before the age of thirty-five with 2.5 children and a picket fence. When she didn't get her wish she cut off all her hair. That simple but very well written. I cried at the end so I deducted a point for that. I don't like sad endings."
4,Kept my interest,"""Nappily"" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her ""finding herself"" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you ""hanging"". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!"
3,Not a great story,"I found this book less than substantial. It seemed to jump around with no real focus. For example, she cut off her hair - so what. I understand the history of black women and hair very well. Yet this is 2003 and this story angle goes nowhere.What a undefined character. I had a hard time figuring out what she was going through. She was convinced she was right about Clint yet that aspect was never fully developed. She harrassed everyone about seeming injustices with no real basis.She meets a man on a plane and a short time later she is in love. What happened in between?I did not enjoy this rambling story."
3,A little disappointed!!,"The story was well-written, but I was just a little disappointed with the ending. The book could have ended, so much more better than that. A woman is not go wait 4 years to get married, just to break-up and the man marries a woman he has known for a couple of weeks, give me a break."
3,"This book was entertaining, but had nothing to do with 'napp","As a 'happily nappy' woman myself, I ran to the bookstore when this book was released. The story was entertaining, but had nothing to do with 'nappy hair' or the issues that face Black woman with natural hair. This was the story of a Black woman and her various relationship issues - not 'nappy issues.' I felt that she could have had permed hair and the story would have essentially been the same so I feel the title is misleading. Thomas' writing style was good enough, but I felt the story dragged after a while and some of thc characters were too transparent and generic and 'soap opera-ish.' If you want a Terry McMillian type story then this is for you, but just don't expect anything too new here....."
4,Entertaining and informative,"Venus is a sista that has it going on in every way. She has a good job, live in boyfriend and long pretty hair. Out the blue one day, Venus goes to the beauty salon and instructs her stylist to cut her hair off then she sends her boyfriend on his way. Wonder what cause this? Venus is in search of her independence. This is an outstanding debut. God's Blessing's to the author."
2,Uneven,"While the author does a good job of illustrating the personal ""good hair vs. bad hair"" trauma of black girls everywhere (myself included), too much of this novel is bogged down in romance novel cliches to make the overall plot resonate."
4,Great job for a first time author!,"I enjoyed reading the book but I think that the character, Venus Johnson, could have been more developed. I was expecting for all hell to break loose after she cut her hair.....however, in all actuality, her cutting her hair was an end result. It seems as if she was not fulfilled with her life before cutting her hair and still never gained fulfillment after. If anything, it added more havoc to her life (at least in her mind). The title of the book was an excellent choice in that it is eye-catching and sparks curiosity. However, Venus was neither ""nappy"" nor ""happy""......or is that the irony of it? Overall, great job for a first time author. I applaud Mrs. Thomas on her work and wish her much continued success!"
2,... Ever After,"C'mon. We've all read this stuff before: E.Lynn Harris. Bebe Moore Campbell. Terry McMillan. Ad Nauseum. And most have done it better. I don't know any black people who talk or act like these characters. They were like cardboard cartoon people. For all of her talk about ""cutting off"" her hair, Venus still was NOT NAPPY!! She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must."
3,"""Happily Ever After""","This novel is guilty- pleasure,off- base,confusing and happily ended relationship!"
3,"They live happily ever after, without the kinks and naps!","Venus and Clint are in love with one another and themselves - sometimes it's hard to tell who they love more.Ms. Thomas begins with an engaging page turner that will make you laugh and think as Venus takes you through her search for self - through her hair. The journey is long and sometimes draining because her hair was long, and she seemingly takes us through each strand. Read on...Venus and Clint do live happily ever after without all the kinks. The kinks were not in Venus' hair, but in the couple's eyes because they were so self-centered. Once their attention is taken off themselves, Venus and Clint find love and live happily ever after."
4,"NOT NAPPY ANYMORE, JUST HAPPY!!","I THINK THE BOOK NAPPILY EVER AFTER WAS APAGE TURNER AND SOMETHINGS THAT HAPPEN IN EVERYDAY LIFE, LIKE THE SAYING GOES U HAVE 2 LET SOME THINGS GO 2 LET UR BLESSINGS FLOW, AND I GUESS THATS WHAT SHE DID. U GOT ME ON SOME PARTS OF THE BOOK B/C I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS KANDI WHO WAS SENDING THOSE NOTES 2 VENUS BUT IT WAS TYSON'S WIFE. I THINK THAT VENUS LOST OUT ON A GOOD MAN B/C SHE WANTED HIM 2 MARRY HER WHEN SHE WANTED AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE GET GREEDY AND WANT WHAT THEY WANT WHEN THEY WANT IT. SHE DID FIND HER ANOTHER MAN AT THE END AND THAT WAS ALL WELL AND GOOD AND I WAS HAPPY FOR EACH OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK AND I WISH U THE VERY BEST IN UR CAREER. U R A VERY TALENTED WOMAN AND GOD BLESSES THOSE WHO BLESS OTHERS AND U HAVE W/ UR INSPIRATION. OOH BEFORE I FORGET I KNOW U HAVE PROBABLY HEARD THIS BEFORE SO I HOPE U DON'T GET OFFENDED BUT ON UR PICTURE U LOOK LIKE LYNN WHITFIELD. THAT IS NOT A BAD THING. GOD LUCH AND GOD BLESS>"
5,Great book,I enjoyed this book. I needed to read a book like this. There are feelings I need to change about myself and this book made me realize it.
3,More Substance Please,"I too was expecting more based on the title. Not in a preachy, soapbox kind of way, but more of how the main character felt about living ""nappily ever after"". I'm tired of these black novels with smart woman making foolish choices when it comes to men. I did not find not one redeening quality about this woman's ex-boyfriend to make him worthy of being someone's husband. He seemed boring and shallow, so where was the great loss? The catchy title sucked me into a two dementional book."
2,Struggled Through!,"I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!"
1,Klaatu Hopeless,"I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However ""Hope"" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
3,reviewer,the book is certainly an interesting read. i think it represents a left of center view point. it covers quite a wide range of topics and at times the writer takes a leap of faith inorder to justify his hypothesis. also at times his theories seem to be a bit of a streatch. however i would recommend this book to all who are interested in a world view other than that put out by people who are more right of center.
3,Misleading Title,"Labeled Good Muslim Bad Muslim and with an introductory chapter concerning the misconception between fundamental and political Islam in Western discourse, I ASSUMED this book would have something to do with that. Unfortunately, it dissembled as a genealogical history of modern Islamic terrorism which, undeniably, in Mamdani's case, has purely Western, and specifically, American and Israeli roots. In reality this book is nothing more than a indictment of American history, Israeli history, Spanish history, British history, Dutch history, French history, but never Afghani history, Nicaraguan history, Sudanese history. Nothing but diatribe, although, and why I give it three stars - it is incredibly well-written, engaging, beautifully cited, authenticated, and accurate (you know, on that scholarly level which though causes it to be a compact thesis and self-sustaining, doesn't really cover the whole truth).student,amherst college"
3,"Subpar, but still engaging","I've read all of the books Reynolds has published under the Ace imprint, and this is definitely my least favorite. The central conflict feels contrived. In a number of ways, the faction fights among the Rockhopper crew seem like a lite version of the (not wildly convincing either) even more bitter, but quite a bit more meaningful fights among the Martians in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series. More frustratingly, a very important disagreement over objective facts is central to the story but, even though the facts should be knowable, they are never revealed. Still, Reynolds still compels compulsive reading even when he's not at his best. I recommend the book to all Reynolds fans, but those not familiar with his work should read the Revelation Space series before considering this one."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others."
3,An old story told again but told well.,"The story is not a new one, its very similar to Arthur C. Clark's tales told in his ""Rama"" series. But it is well written and held my interest."
2,Boring Ice,"I usually enjoy the thrill of grand space operas. No suspense in this one though. Everything was totally predictable. The conflict between Svetlana and Bella was tedious; the aliens were somehow uninspired. I enjoyed a couple of his other books, but this one was far too long and uneventful."
1,Confusing,"Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the ""structure"".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."
4,Solid SF,"I've enjoyed Alastair Reynolds' books since I stumbled upon Revelation Space. I was a bit disappointed by Century Rain - partly because I just wanted more in the Revelation Space series... partly because it didn't live up to the promise of Reynolds' earlier books. I enjoyed reading it, but not as much as I'd hoped.Pushing Ice is an improvement... it's a good solid epic space story. Reynolds has a knack for good ideas and good characters, and it shows in Pushing Ice. There's a particular conflict in the story that doesn't quite work for me; unfortunately it's central to the plot, but it felt a bit forced (like these people should have known better). I could have done with a bit more explanation/exploration of the bigger picture, too. Regardless, I really enjoyed the story and am looking forward to his next book."
3,"Fun sci, poor fi","There's a great sci-fi story in here. If someone were to sit and spin the outline over the watercooler, it'd sound like a must-read. But despite all the character building, when it comes to crunch time, Reynolds downs crafting tools and merely brutalizes the characters like an [...]with sock puppets.This book does have some of the cant-put-down qualities of Rama, calling it a space opera doesn't do some of the long, delightful sci-fi segments justice, but when the author intervenes to bully the characters into plot-conformance, I had to leave the book for several days until I could pretend those pages never happened."
4,Great book!,"This was a very good read. It did start slow, but it really hooks you. And it felt to me as though it were several books in one. I loved the balance between political intrigue, personal passion, and science. While not perfect, it was a good adventure."
5,Hard SF makes a comeback,"After many years wandering lost amid fantasy mislabeled SF, and turning in desperation to the oldies but goodies written by Niven, Zelazny, and their ilk, I stumbled onPushing Ice. Fabulous! Enough explanation that this non-physics major can follow (or pretend to), with plenty of action. The typical male failure (sorry, guys) to track character development, but it is quite possible (sorry, girls) for a woman to hold an implacable grudge for 50 years or even 18,000. 5 stars for the pleasure to read some really good, and new, hard SF."
4,By a true scientist!,"An exciting science fiction novel that pushes the limits of scientific imagination. Mr. Reynolds has a Phd in Astronomy and worked for The European Space Agency for 13 years. Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad"
4,Pushing Ice,"I brought this book after reading some favorable reviews. I was not disapointed. I enjoyed the build of the story, which is a large story covering many years with many stories within. Would most definitely recommend to the space sifi addict who likes a good story with many twists."
5,A vortex of ideas....,"Other reviewers mention technologies and relationship to previous stories. Yes, but I would add that Pushing Ice is a major novel featuring complex, believable female protagonists. They deal with frustration and competition on an intellectual level; in a first-contact story, there is a lot of both. People change only gradually (clinging to old beliefs) as the universe changes drastically around them.Several chapters build toward crises, and I hesitated to start the next because some character faced certain defeat. But few disappeared, and new scientific concepts are thereby introduced. The last chapter really does not end the tale- you will find yourself wondering what the crew of Rockhopper will encounter next. This book really pulls you into their lives."
3,A shorter book would have improved its quality,"I am an avid fan of Alaistair Reynolds.Chasm City is among my all-time favorite books ever. The setting, the people the whole atmosphere were just perfect.'Pushing Ice' delivers an interesting setting. The whole ""what is with this moon that makes it move out of our system' was very good.But I don't want to read 250 pages until they get on that thing and when the interesting part starts you only get tiny bits on the last 50 pages.The whole 'women friendship theme' was a bit over the top. Locking up someone for 30 years because she made a bad call (which she had to make) and still have a grudge.The fountainheads part was interesting, but as mentioned far too short."
3,made in japan,"This is an excellently photographed book with upbeat and ""time related"" narrative on the subject. Unfortunately for those interested in the history or actual dates of when each of these radios were issued the reader will have to guess. Somewhere between 1950 & 1960. Not a great resource for someone starting a collection or trying to date that artifact found in your attic."
3,Cheap fish,I bought these Koi hoping for a bargain on quality windsocks. They fly alright because they are the cheapest nylon imaginable and are already fading. The string is cotton twine and you need to add a swivel of your own or they will not spin in the wind. Cheap chinese junk.
4,Profound Insight Into the Emotional Problems of Man,"This work is best read in the context of Reich's work as a whole. In particular, this work is quite different from the rest and reminds us how prolific the author is. In this book, Reich draws parallels between the crucifixion and modern day emotional pathologies. It may be painful for some to read this book. It equates the 'murder of Christ' with a common modern day phenomenon of which we are all active participants."
4,a must read book!!!,heavy to read!! still worth it to get to understand how institutions and the masses function over individual persons willing to change our paradigms!!
2,translation,"Even thou I enjoyed the art, the book wasn't in english. I wanted to read and understand about the art, to bad."
5,Great Book!,I am a huge Dali fan and this is another one of those books that gives a great insight into the man's thoughts and feelings.
2,Beware of the size of this book!,"Beware of the size of this book!If you are expecting to receive a regular size art book, you will be extremely disappointed. The book measures 7.5 x 9 inch and is thinner than my pinky finger.However, if you are just interested in the content, there is a lot to look at and to read."
3,"Close, but no cigar","This is a good looking, small unit. The remote control is very convienant and this heater has some great safety features. I dont feel that it gets warm enough however. I live in Vermont and it gets pretty cold. It takes a long time for this heater to have any effect on my room.If you live in an unusually cold region, I would recommend opting for a bigger sized space heater."
4,"This is a nice portable heater,for the office,or den..Is quiet,and good for spot heating.","This portable heater is good for use in your office, den or sleeping area..It is quiet and efficient,and is good for spot heating...please keep away from drapes or rugs,and small children,who might mistake this heater for a toy...Otherwise this is a good deal...Mine came with a remote to adjust setttings more easily...4 star rated..."
2,Jerry Bernstein..DeLonghi Safe Heat heater #DFH550R,"ON/OFF button extremely hard to work, maybe broke. Numbers on temp dial very hard to read. Once you get it going, it works OK."
3,positive with reservations,"This two-disc set has some excellent stuff on it, including most of David Essex's big British hits. But there's plenty of filler, including some recent recordings that are simply terrible. And why use new recordings of such Essex hits as ""Silver Dream Machine"" and ""Oh What A Circus"" when the originals are so much better? The choice of songs is sometimes puzzling."
3,The Kindle version,"The contents of Gardner's book are thoroughly reviewed elsewhere. I intend this ""review"" as a warning only for Kindle customers. The Kindle version of this book is faulty. Paragraph are in the wrong order, usually at the beginning of chapters. At best, having to unscramble paragraphs is distracting. At worst, it could lead to misreading of the text, which would certainly be unfair to the author as well as the reader."
5,This was a terrific book!!!!,"I have read many books about the Lindbergh kidnapping. I feel Lloyd Gardner's book is thoroughly and thoughtfully researched. I have read it twice carefully and each time I read it I discovered new information. Who was John Condon? Why did Violet Sharpe commit suicide? Why did Lindbergh act so strangely the night of March 1,1932? Does a parent call his attorney before calling the police when he suspects his 20 month old child is missing? There are so many bizarre events surrounding the disappearance of the Lindbergh baby that it is no surprise that Lloyd Gardner titled his book ""The Case That Never Dies"". The trial was a farce and a circus: an embarrassment to the State of New Jersey. Read it!!!!"
4,Itineraries for Touring & Exploring the Black Forest,"Written with the motorist and independent traveler in mind. Carefully chosen itineraries guide you to historic towns and villages, beauty spots and some lesser-known areas. Distinctive page symbols point out the information you need. Useful information gives opening times, transport, currency, accomodation and much more. Color photographs capture the true essence of this fascinating region."
3,Poor sound quality but there is a solution,"This album was recorded at Radio Recorders in December 1952. Radio Recorders was among the best studios in the country at that time. Fred Astaire recorded a two disc album with Oscar Peterson that same month and it is crystal clean. Also Ben Webster recorded there with the Ravens in December 1952 as did Anita O'Day - all with good clean results. Clearly the Peterson tapes are missing and noisy discs were all that was available for the making of the Peterson cd.Normaly I don't like noise reduction but... the 4 CD set Piano Power (available at Amazon) includes all the cuts on this Duke CD and are much, much quieter. Good use of noise reduction."
1,Poor sound quality,"The transfer to digital format from the analog source includes all of the tape hiss on this disc. The content is great, but the background noise is too much on my system. I'd look for another title from OP and pass on this one."
4,TWO JAZZ GREATS,"The first twelve numbers recorded in 1952 will offend those anti-mono listeners who can not support the noise very audible.But don't forget that the liner notes have told you so.The second set recorded in 1959,is worth the price alone of this cd.What i mean is that when you have OSCAR PETERSON at his peak playing the music of DUKE ELLINGTON,it's simply for any jazz fans,the quickest way to get to heaven.OSCAR knows his craft;he can get around those tunes anytime and always find new settings for you to rediscover them.In fact he did,because he recorded ELLINGTON tunes again after that.On these recordings,he has mostly stayed with the tunes and did not go for the adventurous ways.Let's not forget that NORMAN GRANZ,the original producer of this series of songbooks devoted to the composers wanted these to appeal to the mainstream crowd.Mission accomplie."
4,Great Oil-Filled Unit,"Extremely quiet and very well constructed. Warms up a cold room quite quickly. I have read complaints in the past about oil-filled radiators leaving the room smelling of oil. Not a problem with this unit -- the manual states to run the unit on high for 2-3 hrs in a ventilated room when you first receive it.I live in a 75 yr old brick & plaster home with no insulation on the outside walls and no basement heat. The unit works wonderfully in my upstairs bathroom. (The manual states that you should not use the unit in bathrooms, but I am careful to place it away from any sources of water.) It also works well in the basement bedroom, but it will not heat the entire basement.The only complaint is with the digital display. It is difficult to read, but not impossible. The mfr should consider a magnifying lens over the display or perhaps backlighting the LED display."
3,"One major flaw, so I can't give it five stars.","I love Oil filled radiator heaters, but I'm not so crazy about this one. Here's why - the electronic read out is nearly impossible to see, so all the wonderful features are wasted. You have to crouch down on your knees, and there has to be ample light.I advise you to save your cash, and buy the cheapest version of this item, with the manual on/off dial. The digital version will just make you feel like you are losing your eyesight.So, five stars for the oil radiator, just don't buy this one."
2,Complex controls don't come on after power outage,"I bought this to keep the inside of my RV from freezing up during the week (we use it on weekends). After a power-outage of about 30 minutes, the unit failed to come back on so everything froze up. Since we are prone to brief outages, this was not acceptable. I replaced the Delonghi with a $20 space-heater and have not had another problem."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"I had these bowls on my wedding registry and my sister in law ordered them for me. The first time they came, they were all broken and cracked. We thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. The second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. I just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they ALL had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime I put liquid in them they leak). They are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. KitchenAid can do better than this...I was very dissappointed!"
2,Just ok...,"I have had these for a little over a year now. The edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. They are ok, but not wonderful. I feel like for a Kitchen Aid product, they should be much better."
4,Compilation of ballads (with a great late night feel),"This volume is a compilation of ballads taken from albums Joe Henderson recorded in the period 1992 to 1997. The music is supurb - Henderson almost whispers through his saxophone - and provides the perfect setting for a pleasant evening. Those who seek a late night CD look no further! Those who wish to explore Henderson's work of the nineties in more detail should consider buying (one of) the albums used for this compilation: ""Lush Life"", ""So Near, So Far"", ""Double Rainbow"", or ""Porgy & Bess""."
4,Great guidance resource,"Guidance for workout training, eating healthy, and caring for your body with ease and diligence. Recipes for making beauty products and remedies from organic ingredients.

She's proof treating your body well at any age by adopting healthy lifestyle changes and simple fitness routines can make dramatic improvements to one's health, flexibility, strength, and outward beauty."
2,"Cool, but not durable","My little brother just got this for his birthday. It's cool, but will probably be broken in a few days. The pieces that stick to the wall fall off alot. No action figures come with it either. And the bottom half is made of cardboard too--not cool."
2,Falls apart very easily,I bought this for my 6 year old son and it is very unstable. It falls apart way to easily. We have to lean it up against the wall so he can play with it and it still falls down.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,My son is a HUGE bat man fan. This was a must last christmas.. well we never could get it to stand up right and then bat man wouldnt slide down with out him pushing him the rest of the way. It came apart no matter how easy he was with it. And he lost interest less than a week of tring to make it work. He still wants a bat cave so we bought the older version (that has great reviews)instead this christmas so hopefully this one will be the one to make him happy and my pocket book.
3,"Not bad, but the Justice League Watchtower is better","My son does love this one, but it is kinda flimsy. The first one didn't work, the elevator always stuck. However, mattel was excellent with customer service and sent us a new one within days. This one has held up better, and my son does love it...but I recommend the Justice League Watchtower over this one (however The Batman series toys don't fit in that one)"
4,My sons really like this toy!,"This was a big gift from Santa to my 5-year-old son and it also gets played with by my 3-year-old son.I put it together in about an hour or so and that was fun for me. The instructions are relatively rotten, but I got it together. I agree that it is not the sturdiest. I had to clamp (AFTER superglueing) two important levels for the rappelling line to work. Whoever was in charge of getting parts to fit together missed the mark.BUT.... I got this toy for $20 bucks and I was willing to do some supergluing...so, the result is a toy that my sons love. There is a lot to do in this Bat Cave and they have a lot of fun doing it.We don't have trouble with it falling over - we just lean it slightly against a wall - no big deal."
1,What a waste!,"This toy is a disaster. Who ever heard of a toy that you had to tape to the wall to balance. Every time it moves, it falls over or falls apart. This is the last time I will ever buy this type of toy. The worst part is the look of disappointment on my son's face the first time he tried to play with this. You people should be ashamed, it's like stealing our money at our children's expense!!!"
1,This toy is not worth the money,"I sure wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item! This is really the only toy my 6 yr old son asked for this Christmas! I couldn't believe how flimsy this toy is. There is no way he could even play with it. Everytime we tried to move it, it fell apart! I am very disappointed and do not recommend."
2,Fun if you can get it to stand up for any lenght of time,"This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the ""cave"" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better. As my kid would say ""DUH"""
4,"I was skeptical, but my son loves it!!!","My 5 year old son has the original batcave, but he had seen this one and really wanted it. It went on sale at our local TOYS R US, so I decided to give it a shot...he was thrilled. At first when I saw all the pieces, I thought I'd made a mistake, but it was really easy and fast to put together. The cardboard backing doesn't fit properly, so we just took it off. The elevator sticks sometimes, but none of these things bother my son...he still think's it's ""the coolest ever"". Might not have been worth full price (from a mom's point of view), but it was worth every penny because my son loves it."
1,This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale,"Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration."
1,Catastrophe Cave!,"The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
1,BATCAVE NO RAVE,"Couldn't wait to give this to my 6 yr. old son last year for Christmas since it was all he kept asking for. When he got it, what a disappointment it turned out to be. Putting it together was a real project & it kept falling apart. The heavier part of the item is towards the top so it had no real durability. The background that supposedly holds it up is made out of cardboard so that was a complete flop so forget about screwing it to the wall. He played with it for like 5 minutes & now it just sits in his room collecting dust & falling over. This year, he asked for the Transforming Gotham City. Maybe we'll try that & see what happens."
4,Who cares...my son LOVED it.,"My son received the bat cave for Christmas. He LOVES it! Of course, it required adult assembly. The adults did become very frustrated and annoyed at the lack of instructions. You would think the pictures would be enough! Once it was up, we knew with one little push, everything would come crashing down. We had to superglue some of the parts AND we screwed it into the wall so it wouldn't fall over every two seconds. The plastic parts do seem very flimsy but I think it'll stand up anyway. My son is only 3 and he loves this bat cave."
4,It is for my son...,"...while I may think it's not the sturdiest of toys my son loves it! He got it from Santa and has played with it every day since. He is 4 and is using his imagination and having fun. I think that is what the toys is all about!I have read several reviews on different products where the parents are frustrated putting things together. Really if the children love it I don't see what the big deal is.With all that said, my son loves his Batcave!"
3,Batcave,"My children really like playing with this toy and get hours of enjoyment out of it.One down side is we have to lean it against a wall or door,as it will tip over if not leaned against something."
2,BATMAN TOYS NEEDS BETTER QUALITY,"I think MATTEL needs to fire the team who makes all the Batman toys, & hire a team of people with quality & creativity in mind. This one of many Batman toys my 6 year old son has, every 5 minutes he comes to me to put the toy back together agian. (I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away! Plus there are three pices to this toy that would fall off as soon as I put on that we didn't need anyway."
1,Very Disappointed ...,"Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise."
1,Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave,"Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
1,JUNK,MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.
1,"Wrong Bruce, you idiots!","Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!"
2,"Fun For a Few Minutes, Until it needs fixing AGAIN!!","My son really wanted this toy and loves batman, so Grandma splurged on this expensive-for-what-you-get toy. First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money."
1,Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing,"We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!"
1,POOR QUALITY,"I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!"
1,Don't Buy The Batcave,My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.
5,Amazing wealth of info,"Almost 500 pages! The author, Fritz Springmeier, shares a tone of info that's mind blowing. It may not all be 100% true yet just a fraction of it being true is astounding. A highly recommended read.This book, though out of print, is freely available in PDF format, at the time of writing this review. If you search for its title on Yahoo there will be some links showing the PDF format for download. One of the sites it can be found on is ministryoflies-com.Springmeier also has a one hour video that can be freely watched. It's also under the same title as the book, and can be better found by searching with Google in the Video section of the search options. It's not as comprehensive as the book but worthwhile. God bless."
4,Good heaters with good features,"As I said, good to very good for small to medium size rooms (12x12). Heaters have 3 speeds, oscillation, timer and theromostat shut off to save heat. I have 3. The oscillation stopped on one and Delonghi replaced it. Price has jumped from $39 to $69 online, a little high. I keep mine on low, especially in bedroom and only occasionally on high to increase room temp. quickly. These would help living rooms with central heat. I read the electric meter daily and chart usage. I shut them off when not home or use timers, except as needed for warmth. See how it does in your environment. Some rooms aremore drafty than others. I built frames with plastic that I use in winter. Important to seal off cold air as much as possible to take advantage of heaters and savings. It's good to read reviews and even try some models that you can return if not suitable."
1,Unacceptable,"The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"
2,take a different class,"After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous."
4,Elaine's Got Rhythm,"My five year old daughter brought this book home from her school library and we read it over and over again. She loved the rhythm of the language and rhyme in the story. She also seemed drawn to the vibrant illustrations. As a parent, I liked how it incorporated many people of all shades as Spanish dancers. It showed appreciation of a culture is not based on your genetic heritage. It reaffirmed that we all can celebrate life with each other."
3,Personal stories from Hyde Park,"This book was written by a personal secretary to FDR from 1942 to 1945 and deals with the days of FDR's presidency that were 'off the record', sometimes so secret that the press did not know about it.It especially deals with the many visit to his estate in Hyde Park New York and the work he did there. interesting to read are the personal friendships the Roosevelts had with many royal familyies of Europe of which the Norwegian and Dutch royal houses seem to have been at Hyde Park most often.It is worth reading for those interested in the more personal sides of this American President."
4,Good intro to Halloween,"This book avoids the pitfall of trying to explain the deeper meanings behind Halloween. It's main focus is on Emily Elizabeth and Clifford deciding what costumes to wear for the holiday, and remembering the things they did with their friends to celebrate last year. Totally age-appropriate introduction for under-threes."
2,might be a good scanner,"my scanner hasn't worked since the day i took it out of the box, installed the software, and the green light is on but when i hit scan it does nothing! looks like it's a dud. lol."
3,Must be coerced to work in Ubuntu Linux,"Does not plug & play with Ubuntu Linux 10.04, and Visioneer does not make Linux drivers. Nonetheless you can force this scanner to work by configuring an override in gt68xx.conf:You need the driver, Cis3r5b1.fw. DL the latest windows .exe from the Visioneer support site. Using wine 1.2.3 (or other version), install the windows drivers, shouldn't give too much trouble. As superuser, copy Cis3r5b1.fw from ~/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/Visioneer OneTouch/Driver/ to /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/.$ sudo chmod 775 /usr/share/sane/gt68xx/Cis3r5b1.fw.As superuser, edit the last lines of /etc/sane.d/gt68xx.conf to read:# Autodetect Visioneer OneTouch 7300usb 0x04a7 0x0444#vendor ""Visioneer""#model ""OneTouch 7300""override ""visioneer-onetouch-7300""firmware ""/usr/share/sane/gt68xx/Cis3r5b1.fw""---Plug in the scanner to the USB port.$ scanimage > ~/test_image.pnmIt can take up to 30 seconds to start scanning."
3,Limited Life,Its very good as long as you don't change/upgrade your OS. I just can't understand why the manufacturer does not upgrade the drivers? Works fine on Windows XP. But one can't live with XP all the time?
2,It doesnt work with Vista,"The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. It doesn't work with Vista, no drivers, so is useless to me. I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP. My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality."
1,Save yourself the trouble,"I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."
3,Happy Reading for Grades 2-4,"This book fits into the category of UNrealistic fiction because the characters are universally helpful and cheery, with the exception of the lead character, a boy who is sad that his dog died, and does not want another pet as a result. The other characters offer him various animals to entice him to get a pet. This is an easy, safe chapter book for young readers looking to ease their way into chapter books. I can't see this book interesting anyone beyond fourth grade."
5,Great Book,"This is a really great Animal Ark Pets book. A new boy named Jack moves into Welford. Mandy and James know he's sad so they try to get him to adopt a rabbit, but Jack doesn't want one. Then at a picnic the rabbit is in danger. Will Jack be able to save him in time?"
5,REALLY RECOMMEND!,"I just bought this toy for my 4 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it and is playing with it every day! She was very excited pulling out the puppies to see how many the mommy would have. I would really recommend this toy, especially to those who love puppies!"
4,"Fun, thought-provoking, original music","Not to date myself, but I have the original on well-used vinyl. This album is one of my all time favorites because of the originality of the music. Sure, comparisons can be (and have been) made to many other groups, but each song is a slightly different style. Fun surprises for those listening very closely (headphones help). ENJOY!!!"
5,"If you want to buy an edition of this album, this is the one","When it was announced that this remastered CD version would reveal new things to even the most accustomed Klaatu fan, I was skeptical. Then I heard it. No other CD edition comes remotely close to this one! My only, _singular_ gripe is that an extra crossfade was added between True-Life Hero and Doctor Marvello (which the band insists was wanted by them ever since the first days of the album, and that they had passed on it on the original release simply because they had maxxed out their studio's capacities). Apart from that, this is an amazing reissue! And now that Hope is ready and on its way, I'm looking forward to hearing that remastered issue as well. Unreal!...Oh, and the album is really great as well. They're _not_ the Beatles, time has proven us that... but this album is worthy of the Beatles moniker! Sun King it is."
3,Almost good enough.,"Great color match and protection. Poor anchoring system. Anchoring systems are easy to do - just copy the OEMs. But no, this product falls short here. With a better way to secure the mats, this product would be an easy 5. As they are, I struggle to give them a 3."
5,A Summary of George and Joy Adamson's work,"This is a great summary program about all of the work George and Joy Adamson did. It features Elsa, Boy, Christian, and the lives and personalities of George and Joy. A lot of perspective from Mrs. McKenna who played Joy in the film."
1,Terrible Picture Quality,"Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor. The picture is almost unwatchable because it is so blurry. I'm amazed that they even release stuff that basically has bootleg quality. I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage."
5,A Mostly True Adventure,One of my top books of my 7 decades of reading! Love the way it's told in the voice of the 13-year-old. Great descriptions of the French setting in the country!!
1,Did not like,Just not my type of book. Very boring but I got through it. Hard to stick with it until the end.
2,"Fine for children, boring for adults","One has to be a young adult to enjoy this book. If you want to read about children in a foreign country without adult supervision, well, there you have it. I'm surprised it wasn't turned into a Disney movie.Definitely a children's book."
2,USB ports won't work with iPod,"Bought this card to use with an iPod, and was greatly disappointed. My new iPod only comes with a cable to connect to USB 2.0 ports, and the USB ports on this card DO NOT WORK with iPods. I had to go buy an additional cable (iPod to Firewire) in order to get my iPod working. The Firewire ports on this card DO work with an iPod, but you'll need a Firewire cable that new iPods may not give you."
4,Works like a charm,"This is so much better than an external device. No extra power source to worry about and less clutter. If you're looking for extra USB and Firewire ports, this is the way to go. I only wish the firewire speed was 800 instead of 400, but at $40, who can complain? If you think you're a luddite and can't install a PCI card, I can tell you it's really easy. Not much different than plugging in your USB device, actually. Just open your computer, remove the PCI cover (one screw) and pop this one in! And if you have Mac OSX 10.28 or above, no driver is needed. I was up and running in five minutes."
2,Bad quality,Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.
2,"Easy installation but unreliable Firewire slots, slow warranty repair","I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars."
5,Absolutely awesome service and product,"I ordered this card yesterday (19 Oct 2006) and received it today (20 Oct 2006), free shipping with Prime - excellent service.The card?I installed it in my Quicksilver in 3 minutes and 2 minutes later my USB 2.0 300GB external disk drive was screaming through a complete backup.No need to go to the vendor's web site for drivers - Tiger supports it out of the box. Superb value."
1,Does not work with PowerMac G5,"Although the specifications state compatibility with macs G3 or higher, this card will not fit into the pci slot of a new G5.(...)"
4,Review of Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook,"This C.D. was my first purchase from an American supplier,I must say that I was most impressed with their response and the delivery which took only 13 days from a small town in Kentucky to my home address,all for a cost of only about 11.The C.D. which originated from a recording made in 1957,is of first class quality and I am very pleased with this purchase, it replaces a vinyl disc that I can no longer play,and I hope to replace some of the other records of the same era."
5,Perfectly Imperfect,"If you can only afford one Ella songbook set, make Ellington the one. Ella and Duke are perfectly matched. Having her sing with the composer is a unique feature of this set. There is an exuberant spontaneity here which is unmatched by any other songbook album. This mean that there are some imperfections and improvisations, and that's what jazz is. The material is fabulous. The obvious reciprocal adoration and respect of these two legends permeate everything. It is one of the all time great jazz albums ever. Not to be missed."
5,THE MOST UNUSUAL IN THE SONGBOOK SERIES,"Even if i could have done without the third disc,this tribute to DUKE ELLINGTON really hits home ,and is a must buy for anyone interested in these two legends of jazz.ELLA takes more chances here than in previous and later records of the series ,and this is probably due to DUKE himself who took an active part by creating new songs and rearranging a few of his classics.CARAVAN shows ELLA in a rare sensual mood ,and does she delivers?All the well known songs of ELLINGTON are present, from MOOD INDIGO to SOPHISTICATED LADY.The only songbook celebrating a non BROADWAY composer was indeed worth its price."
3,Not my color,"I would recommend this product, if you can find the right color for you. Mine totally did not match."
5,Why isn't there a 6-star rating?,"Well... I really despise reading. I hate it with a passion. There has never been a time when I decide to just ""pick up a book"" for a good time, I usually won't even consider that in my plans. However, a few summers ago I picked up King Rat. And I picked it up again a few weeks later. I lost it, but bought it last summer. I finished it in a weekend because I just couldn't put it down. I read it again a couple weeks ago. Every time you finish that book, something just comes over you, I swear it. It's the most amazing book I have ever, or will ever read in my entire life. Now that that's done, I can go paint my nails."
5,"KIng Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian..","King Rat, tied with Shogun, is the best of Clavell's Asian Saga. He incorporated, and illustrated the very core of what it is to be a man. What makes this book an instant classic, is the simple, yet horrific, setting. Also, Clavell was able to fill each page with such meaning, he didn't have to make a several-hundred-page-behemoth of a book in order to digest the meaning within it. Compelling was the depth that a man falls to in such a desolate existance, and the measures required to lift a man up to some degree of dignity. For his ability to depict the strength of charicter of this western man in asia, Clavell has earned a place of honor among the great novellest of our time."
4,Much more action oriented than other Clavell work.,Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving.
3,A good read!,"I hadn't read anything of Clavell's before ""King Rat,"" so I came to him fresh and with no preconceived notions. I enjoyed this book, but found the ending somewhat unsatisfying.Still, I would recommend ""King Rat"" for its apparently realistic view of the horrors of a POW camp and the lengths to which the human spirit will go to survive. The main character IS an interesting fellow."
2,Not all that profound after all,"I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the ""moral dilemmas"" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a ""moral dilemma"" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."
2,Disapointing,"After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )"
2,king rat,the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl
5,Enjoyed Reading It!,"I found this to be a very entertaining and insightful book. That the author lived through the experience is clear as one reads. Although some of the subplots died off with no explanation and the ending was a bit anticlimactic, overall it kept me turning the pages and I finished it in two days. Some of the dialogue remains with me to this day like from a dying man:(paraphrasing here) ""From nothing and into nothing with 22 years in-between, seems kind of pointless doesn't it?"" I recommend this book as one any fan of WWII fiction should read."
4,Its not bad,"Interesting book with a very different premise. Had read it before, but still enjoyed it the second time. Its set in WW2, but is not really about the fighting."
5,This is one of the best novels ever writen.,I rated this book as high as book godfather and brave new world !
2,Disappointing,"This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people."
4,King Rat,"Unlike other James Clavell novels, King Rat had a point of reference in regard to a place and time that is embedded in more recent memories of people my age.It was not, in my view, as well written as the more completely fictional works but, nonetheless, it described very well the attitudes and stresses of humans in close contact, starving and in fear of death at any moment.The interplays between characters were well drawn to an extent that made up for the absence of the swashbuckling excitement of Tai Pan, Noble House and Shogun. King Rat was different, less exciting but despite that, enjoyable and informative.Sceptic Ian"
2,Numbers Peg puzzle,This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child's age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background.
3,Not the best,"When you take the pieces off the puxzzle, kids have trouble finding where they go. The number shape (indentation) on the puzzle is white so it's difficult to match the number. Unless your toddler knows how to count to 9 they will have trouble with it. Not great in my opinion."
4,Wish it didn't start with zero 0.,"I love almost everything about this toddler puzzle. I don't like that it starts with 0 zero, since I've been teaching to count starting with 1."
3,Where is the number 10?,"It would have been better if the number 10 was included in this puzzle. My son is learning to count to 10. When he is counting with this puzzle, he is looking for the number 10."
2,Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look,1. The 6 and 9 pieces are interchangeable...that led to some confusion.2. I want this same puzzle with no glossy paper glued on. The remains of a drink were spilled onto it and the paper is now peeling off and it also absorbed the stainThe whole reason I buy wooden toys is for durability -- this same toy with just a stained/painted/plain wood would be perfect
3,Gets the Job Done,"I bought this because my 22m likes puzzles and has good hand-eye coordination. He has showed an interest in letters and numbers recently. I tried to find something that was nicer but couldn't. I would preferred a sturdier puzzle with more vibrant colors. I don't really expect much from M&D; products and this lived up to my expectation: it gets the job done. But really, I wish it was nicer. It clearly isn't going to last long and I would have chosen something nicer if I had found it.That being said it has helped his number learning. We often play with it in companion to an alphabet/number book."
4,Great Teaching Tool,"This is a great puzzle to have in a childcare center , the children love working with the different numbers"
3,Very cheap compared to most Melissa and Doug products,"There is nothing wrong with the puzzle, but it is very thin and made of thick cardboard, not wood like the other Melissa and Doug puzzle I have. I stepped on one of the pieces by accident and ruined it almost immediately. The ""6"" and the ""9"" are interchangeable and because the area where the piece fits into isn't color coded there is no real indication as to which is which. The pegs are very small and useless."
4,4-Star but not Recommended.,Shirley Horn is not an artist for compilations. Please refer to the originals ... You will find all of them in each CD in the Amazon store. This is no more than a Verve penny-hunter CD. Worst of all be aware that the same track Come a Little Closer is included in another compilation title in the store (The Ultimate Shirley Horn). An absurd. Go direct to titles like `You Wont Foget Me` or `Here`s to Life` or `Close Enough for Love` or all titles in the store but not to those dishonest compilations.
1,Summer-Estate,"Anyone who hears this song and isn't mesmerized, then haunted, is deaf. I heard it in my car and almost wrecked. The most beautiful!"
3,Unpreserved saline.,"I buy a lot of this for my son who wears a special type of contact lens. [Boston Scleral Prosthetic contact lenses] This lens requires non-preserved, so there's not the option of using lightly preserved saline. [...] We could not use it if it's in a large bottle, as it only maintains acceptable sterility for 3 days, then has to be thrown out. So the smaller bottles are better for that reason.Hope this helps."
1,Question,"Why does it look as though the same person wrote all seven of the reviews above? Kind of odd, huh?"
1,A waste of time,"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."
5,Love Mozart,"Loved the documentary about Mozart. I learned things I never knew about him. Too bad he died so young, can you imagine the amount of music he could have written?"
4,Quality product,"These canisters are well made and the lids fit tightly. However, I ordered Cinnabar and was disappointed in the color. It is like burnt orange and I wanted something in a deep red color. Be sure of the color before you order."
4,The picture is inaccurate,This product was very nice and I would have kept it had the color been what I saw online. The picture online showed a dark scarlet red canister set and what I received was a bright fire engine red canister set. It did not match my decor so I had to send it back - sadly.
3,It was okay,Something new I wanted to try. It did what I thought it would. I have recommended it to others. It is a good antioxidant.
4,"A la marosca!, Que Punk!",Impressive punk band.. Best of the late seventies/early eigthies. Can't help listening over and over.
4,A bizarre book.,"What I found in this book was something certainly unexpected.I thought it would just be a coffee-table catalogue with episode reviews and character profiles, but instead it was that and much more. The book is made to look like a surveillance survey of the Sopranos family. It's pretty fun to read what the feds 'allegedly' think about some characters or events of the show, but what disturbed me was the fiction that was written there. Some facts are mere fantasies of the author and I don't think they are authorized by David Chase or anyone else from the creative team of the show.So, it's a four-star book, still a good one."
3,Great pictures!,"This book has wonderful pictures but I think it could have been presented in a better way. The pages are small so the pictures are too small in some cases. Some pictures you can't see well because they are spread over two facing pages & get lost in the center. But I love the expressions of many of the fish, you can almost sense their personality. And I love seeing the incredible variety of fish."
1,Frontin',Who gave this guy a music contract? This song is so terrible and overplayed. Plus the guy can't sing he sounds like he is whining. Stay away from this song!!
3,The beats are tight but the singin..nah,"I don't really like Pharell's high voice it gets on my nerves, but the Neptunes make some tight beats like on this and all of their others. the song is alright but the lyrics is kinda wackI would recommend it to RnB fans"
2,It's not the greatest song,"I love the neptunes and almost everything done by them has struck me as gold, but this song is not that great. Pharrell can sing ok, but the beats is their forte. And this beat is nothing special at all. Just didn't do it for me. Also, they added the radio edit of Hott (cot) damn. The clean version of that track is stupid. Better off just listen to the real version on Lord Willin'. Not the best cd single compilation."
1,"The Return of Randy Watson:""Sexual Chocolate""","I'll give the Neptunes Props for being Successful in a very tough Business to make a mark in&they have been doing well for some time now.but as far as Pharell thinking He is the 2nd-Coming of Curtis Mayfield? NAW!Double NAW!!!! Pharell has Radny Watson written all over Him Vocally to me.whenever I watch Pharell up there singing I have a ""Coming to America"" Flashback.but the scary part is that alot of folks are taking His Singing Career as legit."
5,Children like this book,"My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."
1,POOR QUALITY,THESE CLIPPERS FELL APART WITHEN TWO WEEKS.I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH POORLY MADE CLIPPERS.DO NOT BUY.THE PART HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER FELL OUT WHILE USEING IT.
1,Disappointed !,"As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. The interview disc is poor quality and was basically audio from existing early interviews which most fans would have already. The content is dated and is pre reunion.The book has some nice pictures which again, are all pre 'comeback'I would'nt really recommend the item to existing fans, there is'nt really any content of interest. The cover card was scraped on arrival and looked shabby despite having been well packaged."
1,Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment,I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner.
1,ripped-off by seller,"American Electronics Mart sold me a ""refurbished"" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."
2,DocuMate 510 is Horrible,"This scanner is absolutely terrible. I have a small home business and I want to go paperless. If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning."
1,JUNK - don't waste your money or time!,"My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!"
1,Good scanner - poor software,"Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."
1,complete nuisance,"I set it up according to the directions, clicked the scan button, and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process. Uninstalled it, then re-installed it, and the same thing happened. Complete and utter waste of my time. I gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box."
4,great on windows - and mac driver now available (see comments),"I've had great experiences with this scanner connected to Win XP, using the ADF to scan 50 pages at a time without problems. Unfortunately I just bought a iMac G5 desktop & discovered that there is no Xerox support for Mac OS X ! So I will need to keep using my Windows laptop if I want to scan....otherwise a fine product.update March 2009: ExactScan 2 for the Mac now supports this scanner -- pricey software but worth it for me since after five years the scanner is still working great in regular use."
1,Compatible ONLY with their software,"Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!"
4,Some problems - but an adequate unit.,For a cheap sheet-feed scanner the 510 seems an adequate unit (I paid 185 including delivery and VAT) and I've used mine daily for 8 months scanning many thousands of pages. After a paper jam the scanner will not automatically recover - and refuses to continue scanning. In Windows XP the solution is to switch off the scanner for 10 seconds then on again. After up to 90 seconds the scanner will reset itself and the job can be continued. But who'd guess that that was possible ? The instructions make no mention of it and apparently owners have been starting jobs all over again after a jam. The software has worked flawlessly.
4,Educational toy,This is a very effective toy. After rolling a few 7's or 11's it becomes obvious that even a cursory examination will expose cheating methodology.
2,"Good for a little while, but....","Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, ""If the product seems broken, we cannot help,"" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out."
4,"**Great player, but but for newbies**","I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!"
1,Decent player... while it lasts,After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.
2,lacking file format support is not for me,"this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately, my own-made music format is ogg, and downloaded radio recording is asf format, this player don't support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too, unlike iriver, it has digital in and out, this is a necessary for mesorry, zen, this is not for me"
1,Poor substitute for an iPod,"Simply not as friendly for functional as an iPod. Even better, iPod integrates perfectly with iTunes so that managing music is a snap."
1,A Possible Discontinued Item?,"What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm...."
4,Great MP3 Player for the money,"I bought this MP3 player about 6 months ago, and love it. I got an upgrade to expand the hard drive to 80GB and I can't even see myself filling half of it anytime soon. The menu structure is very intuitive, and the screen is very easy on the eyes. I have seen other MP3 players that hurt the eyes when you're looking at the screen for too long.The only issue I have with the player is a short battery life, but I usually have it plugged in with the AC adapter anyway. All in all, if you're looking for a large capacity MP3 player that won't break your bank, this is the one to get."
4,Great Travel Mate,"I take this unit everywhere, and love it. I use this in my car with a C. Crane FM Transmitter and boy is it oh so nice to essentially have your own radio station.I have to admit that the case could be a little better. You have to open it to see the display and make music selections.I also wish it came with a car power adapter, I'm still trying to hunt one down for this particular model so that I don't have to run it off the battery all the time.Other than these two minor issues, this unit is a great value. The battery is easy to get to (meaning you don't have to take the thing apart like the Ipod) and it will play wma files and hooks up to my Windows Systems!"
4,"Solid Player without the ""iPod Mystique""","I purchased this player over 4 months ago. I read all of the reviews and I was aware of the pros and cons going in. This player is slightly thicker than the same capacity ipod. On the upside, the battery is user upgradeable, which iPod users can't do. The main downside to this player is the software. I highly recommend NotMad Explorer from http://www.redchairsoftware.com as a replacement for the poor Creative software. The upsides are great sound quality, great capacity, decent battery life and a good price. If you don't care about looking trendy carrying an iPod, take a good hard look at the Creative Nomad Zen players."
1,Buy it!,"I've had my Zen for over 4 years now (hard to believe I've had it that long). I still haven't filled up the memory on it, I've never had a day's trouble with it, and it's easy to use. I'm starting to find it a bit bulky now in comparison to some of the smaller, sleeker-looking players on the market, but I still have the attitude ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"". The zen is superb, it's reliable, it's solid and easy to use, and I just don't see the point in changing to an ipod purely for aesthetics. I love my zen, and I wouldn't be without it."
3,wish that they didn't have their own software,If you've already got a big music collection in Windows Media Player or MusicMatch you're in for a lot of pain as you transfer your library into Creative's proprietary software application on your PC. All of the information about Music Genre will be stripped out during this process (despite the fact that Windows Media Player was able to read it from my database originally created with MusicMatch).Battery life is only about 5 hours (bad) but you can carry extras and replace them quickly (good).It is relatively easy to change tracks or volume by feel thanks to some little bumps in the controls. A pretty thoughtful mechanical design.
2,Phone Jack Faulty,I loved this thing until 2 1/2 months after purchase... The phone jack is not working properly. Now I am very disappointed. Glad I got a 2 year replacement plan from Best Buy. Recommend you protect yourself if you buy this product. I don't think the phone jack problem is a rare one from what I have read here.
4,Good for the price,"I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day."
4,What a great toy!,"I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."
2,breaks easily and has bad warrenty,the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out
1,What a junk,What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox.
1,Why can't it be rated ZERO stars?,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb."
3,Ski Touring book,I am new to the region and wanted some basic starter info on possible cross country ski areas. This gave me a starting point. It definitely is more back-country based so if you are looking for grooming you probably have to link in with the tahoe/truckee crowd and network from there-but if you haven't tried back-country......making your own tracks with the right gear is what this book steers you to.
4,"Nice portable, small GPS receiver!","I have had this unit and used it for a couple of years now. the reason that I bought it was its portability and I could use it both in the car or have it with me when I am walking. So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra. But other than that it has worked fine for me and I have used it in town and country. I found another navigation SW for it that I think is nicer and performs better than the one that came with it from HP. (...) mine is an MMCX."
3,it takes for ever...,"I have an old Garmin etrek, which is a very basic and robust GPS. I always complained about the time it takes to find the satellites, but this HP device takes a lot longer!Even in open areas under blue sky, it takes several minutes to operate properly. I tried it in San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, and also in Brazil, where I live. The result is always the same: you walk or ride for a long time before it finds your position. Quite disappointing.Buildings and eletric cables interfere a lot with the reception, and very often you will lose signal. Bluetooth connectivity, though, works fine.Having a GPS associated with a PDA (I have an iPaq 4150) is great: there are great softwares available. But life would be a lot better if this unit was more sensitive. I wonder if other brands and models work better.(by the way: the navigation software is very good)"
4,"Works very well, great add-on for IPAQ","I was looking for a solid GPS that wouldn't require the outlay of several hundred dollars. I already owned the IPAQ RX3715. Out of the box the IPAQ GPS unit was partially charged, the software was easy to install and sync with my IPAQ. The unit picked-up strong signals quickly.The maps are a tad dated and although there is an update for the software I have decided to keep the original for now. A savings play.The unit works great in the car, which is the reason for the purchase. You will want to purchase a mount for your IPAQ. The screen will get washed out in bright sun. With the voice command on, this is no problem as you still can hear where you need to turn in plenty of time to figure it out.Overall this has made a terrific GPS investment for the price.Comments are always welcome."
3,It works but....,We bought this because we have the Ipaq but quit often it doesn't work very well. To find the satelites takes long time. It is very sensible...we had to re-load everything... it works but I prefer next time to buy a seperate gps system....
2,disappointed,"I can't share the enthusiasm of my preceeding reviewers.In my opinion, this is a book for advanced fishermen, who already know about fisheries ethics, or don't care about it. The book doesn't cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it's caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(""replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective""), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved."
4,Knowing nothing to something,"I live in NH and just started freshwater fishing for the first time. I went from knowing nothing to gaining some great info on what gear to buy (and not to buy), cold water vs warm water fishing, fish species and lake conditions. There were several helpful pages for techniques for fishing either on a boat or from the shore.The only down side that was not covered (thus 4 stars instead of 5). Was fish cleaning and keeping, and how to do proper catch and release on different species.Good book overall that covers a rather large amount of ground."
1,Many Flaws in Mellor's 'Nursery Knits',"This book's patterns are seriously flawed. My attempt to follow the ""outdoor snuggly"" for a 0-3 month old baby resulted in a 32 inch waistline snuggly with legs that were too long and arms that were too short. In addition, the photos of the snuggly did not match the pattern's instructions. My cousin used the baby poncho pattern and had a myriad of similar problems. Do NOT buy this book!"
3,Good but not 5 stars,I bought this based on the reviews here. This CD starts out very well. It swings and the playing is superb. And Christmas Blues is a 5 star cut. But those strings are awful. When they kick in - I want to hit track skip. 5 stars should mean among the very best with no faults. The other reviewers must like the addition of strings to what would be a superb CD without. Many 60's generation jazz recordings were ruined by adding strings to popularize the music. A jazz trio with strings?!?! I suggest An Oscar Peterson Christmas instead as an example of a first class jazz Christmas recording.
5,Put Ramsey in Your Musical Stocking,"It was never offically Christmas until my mother hooked up the Jingle Bells door chime and my father put Ramsey Lewis "" Sound of Christmas"" on our HiFi. This is a fantastic holiday treat. I have loads of Christmas music, but I place this recording very high in my December rotation. The strings that play on"" What Are You Doing New Years Eve?"" and the bouncy ""Sleigh Ride"" take me back to the Wonder Years of my youth. I believe it will become an evergreen in your collection. Happy Holidays or as Ramsey puts it...Merry Christmas Baby !"
5,I'm in w/ the 'In' crowd',"This was a real find! I've always been a Ramsey Lewis fan since I'm in w/ the In-crowd' hit of the '60's! A nice easy 'laid back' compilation of Christmas songs. Add this to your Christmas CD's, you won't be disappointed!!"
3,Concise is an undersatement,"Concise is an understatement. I was looking to translate our Indian Princess names into Hopi, since we're the Hopi tribe, and I find that there are a lot of words missing. Take the word forest, I was looking for that, but could only find the word trunk(of a tree). I don't have the money for the full blown dictionary at $750 but thought the lexicon would see me through. It really hasn't and I have had to use different words to replace them. One tribe member is called Running Pheasant. There's no word for pheasant, so he has to be Horned Owl. I didn't expect the entire dictionary, but this is really too concise."
5,Excellent Sporty Shoe,This is my best shoe purchase in a long time. Sporty look. Comfortable. Perfect fit. I wear them every chance I get.
5,Perfect shoes,Another masterpiece from Rockport. I recently purchase these shoes and I am so happy with this product. It is very comfortable. Its worth every single penny.
5,Gentle Explanation,"This book is a thorough and gentle explanation of the how the process of forgiveness works, and how completeness in our own lives (we who have been hurt and need to forgive the person(s) who hurt us) can be attained through the five stages of forgiveness. It is also a gentle and compassionate explanation of how hurts affect the various aspects of our lives. Linn's format is easy to read and to understand. A must for anyone's bookshelf."
5,Gets to the root of the issues,"This book, based on Kuebler Ross five stages of death & dying, is a wonderful way to work through life's hurts, giving us permission to take our anger, pain, bargaining, to God in prayer & allow Him to show us how to stop letting the past continue to hurt us in the present. The section on the unconditional love of Christ is healing in its presentation. I have used it over & over & have loaned this book out to my friends in need."

3,"Not great, but not bad","Tallant's book is informative for those new to the topic of voodoo and/or Marie Laveau. However, much of the information in this book is included in his novel The Voodoo Queen, which is far more interesting. Read that instead!"
3,Voodoo in New Orleans,Book is a little interesting. It is sometimes confusing to read. Uses words that no longer used in 2011 so sometimes you will have no clue what you are reading. The parts that are understandable are interesting. I gave it 3 stars because the author doesn't have much facts to back up what he is writing. He interviews people who tell him 3 different stories about things that happened in new orleans and then tells the readers that he doesn't know which person is telling the truth but says any one of the stories could be truth. The book has you wondering what is the real story behind the matter they are talking about. Not enough facts. It was more of a he say she say book and figure out who might be telling the truth.
1,"Tallant's ""creative"" talent","Voodoo in New OrleansThis is an old classic which, if you are interested in either ""Voodoo"" or New Orleans, you probably should read. However, you can ignore the old adage of taking what Robert Tallant had to say with a grain of salt; you will need an entire salt lick to handle this slim volume. It is colorful, exciting, and alas, mostly the product of Robert Tallant's fevered imagination. What facts he didn't get wrong, he completely fabricated.Plenty of scholars have already weighed in on the problems presented and alas, also created by this small piece of creative fiction. It's very entertaining, although occasionally offensive. Mostly, it should not be taken seriously.Eoghan Ballard (Ph.D. Folklore. University of Pennsylvania 2005)"
3,Informative....but,"Not quite what I expected. In fact I read some of the beginning, but then skipped straight to the part about Marie Laveau. It's a very informative book on the history, but not much else worth reading to me."
2,Lousy Book!,"I searched all over to find a book specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find...it's only 240ish pages and I still haven't even made it through it yet. Though there are some interesting facts, I think it's poorly written -- and it's 50 years old! Would like to see a more updated version that is a better read. Maybe will write it myself!"
1,"If you want to know about New Orleans Voodoo, avoid this rag","If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book.Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism.His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong.If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward."
4,Very technical and complex,"This book is very detailed, technical and complex. If you're seriously considering exploring the photogravure technique on copper, this book is a must. It tells you everything you will ever need and all the complicated steps in the process. However, there are few historical or contemporary photogravure reproductions which is why this book gets only a four star rating from this reviewer. If you are seriously considering the photogravure process as one you would like to explore, I recommend starting with solar plates rather than copper. It is much less complicated and toxic. A very good resource is ""Printmaking in the Sun"" (2001) by Dan Welden, inventor of this method."
2,review,"The whole book could have been written in half of its size. Not very well written due to being too wordy, hard to follow."
4,ALERT (must be read immediately) 4.5 stars,"this is the story of what happened to one little boy,who was kidnapped from a loving family in the Sudan, and forced to become a slave at age seven. He remained a slave, untill he finally escpaed ten years later.It did not happen hundreds of years ago. It happenned thirteen years ago.Its written in a gentle voice, but one that conveys the tragedy well.It NEEDS to be read, NOW.Please, if you are a human being, and feel that slavery is wrong and kidnapping is wrong, then read this.I have also been going through the website that Francis Bok is attached to and am learning a great dealhttp://www.iabolish.comDear Francis Bok, if youre reading this> youre a good man and a tribute to the human spirit. A good son."
1,Wow,"I actually give this ZERO stars. But had to give it a star due to Amazon's rules.The title is slightly misleading as it is not all about Wilson's involvment with Manson. That's just a part of it. And warning, that part contains explicit material if anyone cares to know. I know Brian Wilson is the brains behind the Beach Boys, but this documentary was predominantly about Brian. This should have been titled: ""Brian Wilson and the Satan (featuring the rest of them)"".I've seen other Beach Boys documentaries (even made for tv movies) that were better than this jumpy compilation. I felt like I was trying to watch a documentary put together by someone who had ADD."
4,pretty good documentary,"overall, the documentary was pretty cool. however, about 99% of the beach boys clips were from a prior documentary, an american family from '85. they should have included the clip of dennis singing manson's song never learnt not to love (aka cease to exist). especially since the title of the movie is the beach boys & the satan. but did have cool footage of interviews with dick dale and dean torrence and the chantays. also kim fowley was cool too."
3,"Would have been 5 stars, but....","After being spoiled by a REAL audience on 'Live at Newport '56 [COMPLETE]', i am 90% sure this concert recording from 1966 was ruined by the addition of a very blatantly FAKE audience track. Nothing more annoying than canned applause being mixed in and out! AHHH! I think if this hadn't been done, this would be a VERY fine CD. Duke and crew are certainly in fine form. Wish i could have been there."
1,What a piece of junk!,"Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!"
4,Cheap price but not cheap quality,When I first bought this CD player I thought it wouldn't work all that well or the sound wouldn't be that great but it turned out to be a great product. Although I would invest in a more expensive brand if you're looking for more functions the Koss has been very reliable and at such a great price!
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,"I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already. It was used at a desk with ear phones so it wasn't moved,bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone."
3,had some problems but good price,"The skipping is terrible. But it's good if you just want to sit down and listen. Like maybe when you watch tv or go on the computer. If you move it, it will most likely skip. Another problem is that the headphones are never perfect.If you can get used to that, then this would be a good cd player to buy and at a good price."
3,Review of Koss cd player,This cd player is sold at a great price! It is a brand name cd player sold for under $30.00. It has 12 esp which is enough if you don't jog. The cd player has a cool design to. I would rate this a three because it doesn't have a very high amount of shock protection. Great Deal!!!!
2,DON'T BUY THIS,"OK, people, all I have to say is this thing sux. The price may be low, but the thing is just plain crappy. And I though CD players were supposed to play music..."
2,somewhat crappy,"of course you can't expect the ps2 experience to translate to the psp. gameplay is entirely different, even with gamebreakers and such. would make a great way to pass time on long flights or rides if there were mini-games."
5,Just like the other ''STREET'' Games,This is an awsome game for the psp. You should definetely pick this game up at a store. There are party play games which include ''shot blocker'' and ''arcade shootout''. There is wireless head to head mode. This game also includes ea's pocket trax which is when you get to listen to any of the songs from the game. Also King of the court mode. So pick this game up its awsome!!!blue
2,Great Graphics But NO GAMEPLAY and BAD CONTROLING,"When I read these review I thought this game was going to be amazing but no one mentioned that this game has very bad Controling. Here is some on the problems. When you go up for a shot and press the ""o"" button the player goes up and once you let go it takes about half a second for the player to let go of the ball so you really have no SHOT CONTROL. This game is not like many other basketball games where once your let go of the button it shoots. This game has been with me for about 2 weeks and I stopped playing this game on the first day because it got very lame and boaring because you dont have alot of control over your players.There are a few other problems in this game. The players really dont look like the actuall players and do not play like them eather. I would highely reccomend you not to get this game and would suggest ""NBA"" or another great sports game like ""FIFA""."
2,Greasy Grapefruit!,"A sugar and oil mix with an explosive citrus fragrance. Yes, your skin will feel softer, but it's not worth it. I had to wash it off with soap and water, then clean the tub before I got out so I wouldn't fall. Take a shower and spray yourself with oil spray - it's not messy or stinky, and certainly not as slippery!"
2,"Not very good quality, hard-to-see markings","This fan heater can oscillate, which is controlled by the foot switch (i.e., the foot switch doesn't turn the heater on or off). You can tilt the heater, too, but not by much. Overall, the heater feels cheaply made and soemtimes it doesn't work; I have to unplug and replug it to make it go again.The markings for the two knobs (left for power/fan level, right for thermostat) are *very* hard to see; they are almost non-existent. This is a very stupid design decision.I wouldn't buy this heater again despite its low price and good safety features."
1,never again,"I bought this heater and it didn't even work on arrival. The pilot light came on, but nothing else. What a waste of time and money."
1,THIS THING SUCKS,"Not only is the heat (btu)rating false, (in my oppinion), but to me it doesnt put out heat at all (relivently speeking) the tip over feature has prevented the unit from opperating several times in the 3 hours since i recieved it.. furthermore.. i will never purchace a heater made of plastic.. think about it.. plastic melts and metal doesnt (at the advertised tempurature) the fan speed i would equate to a gentle breeze if that. the heat output is far, far, below what i would have expected based on the advertisement.. basically in my oppinion this product is worthless to purchase unless you are trying to heat a refrogerator box sized space 5 degrese in a 70 degree enviroment.. look elsewhere for your heating needs."
4,I love these sound pictures,"Here is a wealth of colorful accessible piano literature for the intermediate to advancing pianist. These sound pictures should be more widely performed and listened to. The pianistic interpretation is very accurate and generally good, but could be more daring and flamboyant in some of the interpretation."
3,Disappeared,"I thoroughly enjoyed viewing DISAPPEARED. sub titles were a great help.The story held my interest from, beginning to end."
5,Love Mercer Mayer,"Every Mercer Mayer book is a hit. I try to buy all the new titles, and my grandkids love them! The art work & the stories are great for adults & children."
3,beach mats,"These mats are really cute and roll up nicely. They have convenient handles for easy carrying and they are really easy to shake the sand out of. However, if you are buying these to go to Hawaii, it is probably not worth it. Found out the hard way that they sell these (mind you without the frills) on every corner for $2-3. These are worth it if you really like the design and the handles for easy carrying."
2,Reaching for the Light,I have really enjoyed this book! I have been learning a lot for my own healing. The reason I bought it was because a few months back I was able to read a portion of the book and I was hooked! I think this book is a must read for people struggling with ritual abuse!!
2,A very simple view of a complex subject,Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.
4,"""This'll kill ya!"" - UNFAITHFULLY YOURS is Faithfully Funny","In a year when INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, GHOSTBUSTERS, and BEVERLY HILLS COP were conquering the box office - this film got lost in the shuffle.Dudley Moore plays a symphony conductor who learns that his wife is having an affair. He hatches an intricate plan to kill her and frame her lover for the murder. However, in typical Dudley Moore fashion, nothing goes as planned.The film starts slow as it establishes the characters, but the final sequence is worth the wait. Fans of the ARTHUR films will also feel right at home as Dudley falls back into ARTHUR's familiar intoxicated-state with an overdose of tranquilizers."
4,One of Dudley Moore's best,This movie is so fitting of Moore [He plays an orchestra conductor.] since he was an accomplished musician himself. It's roll-on-the-floor humour when the conductor's fantasy goes awry.
4,Forget What The Professional Critics Say! This Movie Is Funny!,"I have never seen the original old Unfaithfully Yours movie but I saw this remake on HBO and I thought it was very funny! Dudley Moore, Nastassia Kinski and the rest of the cast were great and I'm glad that this underrated movie is finally on DVD and I highly recommend it. Dudley Moore plays a composer married to a much younger woman played by Nastassia Kinski and he goes kind of mad with jealousy when he thinks she is having an affair and has bizarre fantasies of doing her in! But is she really having an affair or is he letting his imagination run away with him? Watch this hilariously funny underappreciated movie and find out!"
5,Insight Guide Bali,"Insight Guide Bali is an exceptional travel guide. The history is well written and rich with interesting facts. I reads like a good novel. The maps are deteiled with plenty of cross references. There are plenty of travel tips from riding a bus to how to order food without MSGS. It appears that every possible travel issue has been addressed; from how not to get arrested to finding the swank resorts. The book is worth the price just for the exquisite pictures. I have never seen a travel book with photos as exceptional as these. Usually I purchase a couple of guide books before going to a new location, but this time I will only use the Insight Guide Bali."
5,Valuable companion to Harry Smith,"This 1973 book is keyed to Harry Smith's famed music anthology, now available on CD. It is edited by Josh Dunson and Ethel Raim, and includes interviews with Moses Asch and Frank Walker, as well as song lyrics, chords (for many but not all songs on the Anthology) new anecdotes, and very nice b & w photos of artists and rural scenes (folks hanging out on front porches, etc.) Some of the anecdotes are a bit disturbing--about Bascam Lunsford's racism and anti-semitism, for example--but it'll save ear-strain trying to grasp some of the numbers. May not be worth the hefty price being asked here, but a nice volume for those of us drawn to this strange, exciting music."
4,Peroxide,Item was easy to order.Item was delivered as promised on time.This item will be purchased again.
1,OUTDATED,"1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!"
4,Good examples and helpful hints,"I bought this book after i failed to get the score i needed in the TOEFL exam, and it helped me a lot at the second time I did the test. The best part about it is the CD-ROM that has 4 complete tests so you can practice just like if you were doing the real Computer Based TOEFL Test. It helps you to get in the mood of the test so you are prepared when you take the real test. There is only one thing that should be enhanced in this book. The review and hints at the ""writing test part"" are not enough. There should be more essay examples. Over all, this is the book you have to buy if you are planning to pay just for one book to prepare for the TOEFL"
3,"The best Toefl grammar book, but....","The only worth section of this book is the Grammar section. Even if you were at intermediate English-level, you'll improve up to Advanced student. The small details are very helpful to determine test tricks, and common rules - to correct them. So, if you want 600 and more, read it carefully and then review it one more time. But, you'll need another source for practice. Its tests are easier than on actual test( I did 100% on Barron's grammar, but scored 630 on actual test).Not worth to spend time on listening or reading. It would be better to do listening on TOEFL Preparation Kit and reading on Cambridge's or Peterson's TOEFL."
4,Second-best resource,This book is the second-best book on TOEFL after Educational Testing Services' (ETS) TOEFL book.
1,CD Was missing,I dont find any CD inside the book. It was really matter of disgrace that CD was missing after shifting. While I was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the CD will be available but it was missing
2,Humor about males being incompetent in the birth process,"In general, I have little appreciation for humor based on male parental incompetence. Furthermore, ... I have just as little time for humor based on female mechanical incompetence. The theme of this book is male incompetence when it comes to pregnancy and birth. Many of the cartoons are about men being nincompoops in the delivery room, doing such helpful things as fainting, getting sick when looking at the placenta and so forth. ...Some of the cartoons about the baby in the womb are a bit humorous, but overall I did not find this collection of jokes very funny."
1,Hardly worth reading,"This book, while fairly well written, was quite a dull story, and was very depressing to read. Sherwood seems to have researched her subject well, but the book seemed to be unnecessarily vulgar in a number of places, and this made the book all the more unpleasant to read."
5,"Feminisim restored to flesh, blood, & fire.","The blockheadedness & utter insensitivity of the two reviews below, in an open forum such as this, demand a response.Frances Sherwood's reimagining of the life of the brave Mary Wollstonecraft, the woman who wrote the groundsbreaking ""Vindication of the Rights of Women,"" proves quite the equal of her subject. Sherwood brilliantly recreates her protagonist's haunted Enlightenment world, at once alive with new ideas & half-smothered in medieval fears & prejudice. Better still, however, her history goes far beyond the merely correct, investing its conflicts with the chilled yet heightened humanity they must've engendered at the time. The ""Mary"" of this book has the wallop of her namesake, providing a new testament to women's toil & tragedy while never losing her humor, her smarts, or her desires."
4,I was impressed,"I have to say I am a sceptic with herbal cures but saw a short article in AARP so thought I would try it. I have been trying to use diet to lower my cholestrol so I could avoid medications but after a year of that and the cholestene my cholestrol was lower than it had been in 7 years, even my doctor was impressed. I am only able to take 2-3 a day since more gave me stomach problems like high fiber would.overall cholsestrol down 21 pts"
3,"Statin substitute, but has side-effects","Red Yeast Rice has reported cholesterol-lowering effects similar to RX statin drugs, but ""without the adverse side-effects."" However, having had muscle pains with Lipitor and all the other RXs, I noted the same increase in muscle pain when taking RYR. At present I am only taking 1 cap every other day and have only minimal pain."
1,Case doesn't fit phone properly,"The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back. I don't know if they are all that way (maybe I got a bad one?), but I didn't want to buy another one to find out."
2,Can you hear me now...Can you hear me now?,"The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good."
5,Masterpiece,I've listened to heavy metal/hardrock music for close to 20 years now and this is the one record in 10 years that have made me go WOW! At first i didn't think this record was much to have but it grew on me and now i just love it. This record is one that can and will stand the test of time. I'm sure that this record will remembered as a hardrock classic if Evergrey makes it outside Sweden. Tom's voice cries with agony and you can't help to get swept away along with it.
3,fair,"I thought there would be more unique recipes using more vegetables (ie; Spagettie squash, broccoli rabe, etc) and variety of beans not just substituting dairy for soy cheeses."
5,The Best Italian Vegan Cookbook Ever!!!!!!!,"Bryanna has created the absolute best cookbook ever! My friend originally bought this and when she told me I should get it, I remarked ""why would I need an Italian cookbook, I know how to cook vegan Italian!"" I was then treated to several meals at my friend's apt. where she used Nonna's Italian Kitchen and was I wowed!!! I couldn't believe how delicious these recipes are and how satisfying - much better than anything I've ever had as a non-vegan! Now every year for my birhday, my friend knows what I want for my birthday meal from her- the lasagna al forno Bolognese on page 113 - to die for (or to live for really!). Buy this book - all my non-vegan friends love the dishes and can't believe it's not dairy!"
5,Like being on vacation in Tuscany!,"This is a wonderful book with a nice combination of quick and other more involved recipes. I love Grogen's side notes on the recipes and her comments in the beginning of the book. The recipes are divided up into courses of an authentic Italian meal, so it's easy to plan a full menu, or just a single dish. These dishes would appeal to anyone, vegan or not. These are good, wholesome meals. Grogan mentioned in the introduction that Italian was her favorite cuisine with Chinese and Indian running a close second. Maybe she could be convinced to write a Chinese Vegan cookbook next?"
5,That's Italian!,"This book is not only a must for vegan kitchens but for everyone who likes Italian food. The recipes make very authentic tasting vegan versions of popular dishes. My vegan friends are enjoying this food too, always the best sign."
3,Time-consuming but tasty vegan cooking,"I was looking for another vegan cookbook to add to my collection and chose this b/c of my Italian heritage. Everything looks wonderful and tasty but also very time-consuming. As a mother, I don't have enough time to make my own pasta. Also, several recipes call for other recipes in the ingredients so you are really making 3 or 4 different things and then mixing them into one dish. Not an easy thing to do, but obviously real Italian food is never quick to prepare. All in all, it's good but I'd look for a less time-consuming one next time."
3,Good instruction- lots of tricks,"I'm learning a lot from this DVD, but my learning curve is a lot slower than it was for Level 1.I've ordered a replacement, but the DVD stopped working in my computer after only 2 viewings. Hopefully the replacement will last longer. It does seem to be lower production quality than level 1, like other reviewers have said."
2,Horrible.,"I have had the first DVD since I bought my first dance hoop over a year ago, and figured that I would give the second one a try. This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product."
2,Cheap!,"I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both."
5,More Excellent Instruction from the Hoopnotica Team,"As with their first dvd, the instruction in this is clear and detailed. The pace is faster than in the first dvd, and they do not cover as many moves, but it is still worth it."
4,Great book.,"As a former teenage girl, I decided this book would be perfect for my teenage daughter. I was really surprised when, while talking to my husband, I learned that he had read and enjoyed this book as a teenager as well. (And remembered it, twenty years later!)"
5,The Island Keeper,"Out of the hundreds of books I have read through out my life, this book remains one of the most endearing to me. Maybe it is the way Cleo triumphs over her life troubles and struggles that I like. Or maybe it was something that I would have liked to do as a girl-escape and make my own pathway toward learning about myself. We are reading this book in our book review group in March 06 and I am so excited to share this with my adult friends who maybe by reading it will have gained an appreciation for this young 16 year old hero."
