4,Nice for the price,"It's a good item, but you may have to adjust from time to time. DOes a lot of stuff, and is well worth the money."
5,"Best value for the price, get's the job done!","I have owned several bicycle computers over the years, some costing the big buck's and in my humble opinion, it is best to keep to the axiom, KISS; keep it simple stupid. There is only so much information the human brain can digest on a ride while reading your bike computer, before getting so distracted that you get into an accident. The more basic the information, the better. This computer will tell you a bit more than the basics, but for the price I can forgive the information overload. When this unit is in the SCAN mode, it displays in progressive order the basic information that I really need to know on a ride. Distance traveled, top speed, average speed, time elapsed, with the current speed constantly displayed in large numerals. KISS. This gets five stars because of the price and value. It is easy to mount, easy to use, and will carry forward your logged mileage by entering it upon initial setup."
1,Skip it,"Skip it. I bought two of these computers for the kids to track their mileage. I was looking for inexpensive computers and was sold on the Schwinn brand name. Bottom line is that if you're already used to using bike computers that work, then you (and the kids) won't be satisfied by these. The display is fine enough, but the button/function control is poor. Usually bike computers have one button to change modes and another button for start and stop that you then hold down to reset the trip information. Not this one. It's totally not intuitive and none of the buttons are labelled. We can never remember from day to day how to start, reset, which combination of buttons to press, which to press and hold, etc. We needed to have the manual with us before each ride. We finally gave up on them and bought different ones. I think I only spent 10 or 15 bucks on these when I bought them last year, so I wasn't expecting too much, but I *was* expecting a usable unit."
1,Don't remember,Do not remember getting this product. Now I must think up 16 words to add so I can send it back.
3,"Nice features, attractive price but...",This is an entry level bicycle computer with many features and acceptable accuracy if installed properly. Below are my Pros and Cons:PROS:- Lots of functions & metrics- Not too big- Accurate- Cheap- Low Key- Schwinn MadeCONS:- Installation & Configuration can be a bit overwhelming to some users (Tip: Read the manual how to do it properly)- When riding in big rain it sometimes looses connection and stops working- Not the most common-sense operation / menu
4,Good value (cheap and functional) but confusing buttons,"Good, cheap computer with all functions listed included, but the 2 buttons are kind of confusing. I skimmed the manual and have used the computer for a few months but still haven't figured out how to scroll through all the functions. I was hoping one of the buttons would just be a straightforward scroll... (like in a stopwatch)"
3,Worked great but not very durable,"I really like this computer, it was a good price and had decent features, although the thermometer is about 15 degrees above where it should be. It was simple to setup and worked. but then i dropped it on the garage floor from pocket height and the screen just flickers. I'm going to try the Bell F12 just for variety but I would buy this one again, and I strongly recommend it for a starter computer"
3,Excellent for the price,"This computer works great and the functions provided are right on. However, I was disappointed in the mounting options - TIE WRAPS. Are you kidding me, talk about uglying up the bike. The plastic clip that holds the computer in place is cheaply made and alas, my computer fell off its mount last week.I will be shopping for one with better mounting. Other than that I really did like this model."
2,Weak mounting system and low speed inacuracies,"This CC has some nice features for the price (backlight, temperature) but is has some unaccepable flaws. My copy had a dead spot between 7 and 8 km/h and it the readout would be 0, stopping the distance meter and the rolling time meter. This would mess up any measurement where you would travel at these speeds, which are quite common for me on some steep and prolonged climbs. The other unacceptable flaw was the flimsy mounting system. The CC was constantly falling off on small jumps and when I went though rough terrain, until one day, it fell never to be found again. I since ordered a bell CC which is less than 10 bucks, it has always given me very accurate readouts with no dead spots and has never budged from its mount, which is very similar in principle to the schwinn mount. If your are looking for a cheap and reliable CC, buy the bell CC for less than 10 bucks instead."
5,Great buy!,"For the price you can't beat this! I would say the hardest thing (which took less that 5 minutes to do the math and program) is the wheel diameter ratio, where I actually had to spend a minute doing math! Some reviews mentioned installation was hard, but really it's not rocket science, and if I can do it, you can too! Weeks after purchase, I started using a cycling App that calculates speed and distance (without the other useful features of this product) and it was very close to the reading of the GPS measurements, even after 20+ miles.Pros: Low price, multiple features, accurate readingsCons: Make sure you lock it in place when reattaching it to the mount, otherwise you can easily lose the monitor from the mount!"
2,Crap wiring,"Set up was an easy 5 stars, very easy to attach everything to the bike.The wiring on the other hand was just garbage. The wire is so thin and I didn't leave enough slack in the wiring so it easily snapped rendering this product useless. They do not sell replacements either, you would have to buy the whole new computer for it to come with the replacement wiring and sensor.The instructions did say leave slack, which I did because I am indeed smart enough to read simple instructions, but it should have given some pointers as to what enough slack is or where you should strap the wires on the bike.On initial set up, I gave enough slack to rotate front tire all the way to the left and right just to be sure. Somehow this was not good enough.The computer seemed pretty good though, too bad its useless.I will be going with a unit that has better and thicker wiring next time."
4,Sensor cable is way too short for my recumbent. Great Otherwise.,"I was hoping this would work with my recumbent... had great reviews for such a low price. The cable wasnt nearly long enough to reach my front tire. I ended up mounting it to my diamond frame bike. The computer works quite well on that, which im sure that was what it was designed for. So i will only ding 1 star off."
4,Can't Beat it!,"The only reason 4 stars is b/c I bought 2 of these and thought I had the correct circumference of the wheel programed in both and I guess I didn't.. Programing the circumference of the tire, in order to get the correct values was much more difficult then I expected. Otherwise, it seems to be working just fine."
4,Solid Basic Wired Bike Computer,"Inexpensive.took off 1 star because it takes a while to learn how to program, but once understood easy to use.note: I am a techie.Works well even after dropping.Fairly legible when mounted.I carefully followed instructions (+ google) to mount sensor and thread wire to handle bar.Never came loose and worked perfectlyUnfortunately flew off during a nasty mishap and was left at the scene.I will definitely buy it again.."
4,Great deal,This is a great deal for the amount of options you get. Unlike many others I did not find it hard to install at all. With all the options you do need to read the manual a couple of times to make sure how to use and reset all the options but you still can't go wrong with this product.
3,"it's ok, but a little hard to work","it's ok, but a little hard to work. you have to start all over each time you take your bike out"
4,Great Cheap Piece of Hardware,"It took a little while to figure out, but I managed to mount this on my bike after around 20 minutes of work. The clearly showed everything seemed to tuck away quite nicely. I had no difficulty reading any of the numbers. The readout seemed accurate, and I had measured this while having someone compare my readouts to a car's. However, for some reason I still feel like I should test this part a bit more. If there's one complain I have, it's the mounting.Everything seems to slide a bit, except for the magnet bit that's attached to the cable. Granted, the roads I ride on are a little rough, but it would've been nice if the pad that keeps the display from sliding everywhere to be a bit stickier. The magnet that attached to the spoke also had this problem, but it's only a slight issue. However, for eight dollars, this is a great piece of hardware."
3,Hard to setup,"Really useful product now that I managed to get it installed, but setting it up was a real pain in the Bu!!.However now that it is setup love the speedometer and the distance covered, though sometimes it is a bit hard to change the screen while riding.Have not used the other features so far. but it fits snug on the bike and the screen is very easy to read."
2,Schwinn Bike Computer,Today I received a Schwinn 17-Function Bike Computer from Amazon Order ID [...]I cannot get it to work. The manual refers to left and right buttons. There are no buttons on the computer. It also does not respond to the magnet. No response to anything. The battery seems to be alive--I checked it with my VOM.
3,"Good for the price, but clip mechanism is cheap.","This computer is pretty good for the price, but the clip that holds it onto the handlebars seems very cheap and seems like it's going to break at any moment."
1,Schwinn Monitor,This is item is very bad upon shipping..It did not work at all. IT was very poor and low quality made..I am not certain why they even sale this item when knowing it's poor design and not working.
1,You get what you pay for.,"The LED display didn't work very well and the actual settings steps did not correspond to the instructions. I finally just gave up and tossed the device in a box. I'd return it, but since it wasn't very expensive, at all, and the hassle of repackaging and taking it the post office, and contacting the vendor, etc. are all sufficient enough a deterrent to cause me to just consider this a bad purchase. I should have purchased one locally from a Bike shop, so that I could have just more easily taken it back in for an exchange or refund. This was one of those ""You get what you pay for"" bargains...I paid next to nothing and that's what I received in return. Lesson learned."
2,Not too happy with this bike computer,I purchased this bike computer for both my bike and wife's bike. It was not difficult to install but the setup is. There are too many functions. I wanted something to tell us how fast we are going and how far have we gone. It is difficult to reset the trip odometer. My wife hasn't figured it out yet.Not real happy and wouldn't buy it again.
2,Don't get it wet.,This device is fairly accurate in terms of speed and distance as I compared it with my GPS wrist band. Temperature reading is way off though. I got it wet (sensor) on my first ride on a mountain trail with some very small streams and to my surprise it stopped working. I would recommend it for road but not for mountain biking. You get what you pay for.
4,Good puter,"This isn't for a serious, diehard biker. This is great for commuting. It's great for keeping track of your ride. It's great for causal biking. The mount is easy. Unfortunately, it isn't enough to keep it in place. I had the puter go flying in the middle of the road. Still worked, but it was a hazard and a hassle. My recommendation is to use fun-tak or tape to hold it in place so it won't fly off."
4,easy to assemble & use,this Speedometer is digital & easy-to-use.Just be careful of the plastic ties thatyou are supplied with to attach to the bike handle bar.The ends of the ties put 2 long slits in my daughter's knee.
4,Almost the same as 2006 model,"I've got a bike computer with a front that looks exactly like this, but was purchased in 2006. When I needed a computer for another bike, I bought this in a heartbeat because the first one still works (on its original battery!) and has all the functions I need. Its clock is even accurate (< 0.001% off in 3 years), not that I use the clock all that often. Unfortunately, the new model comes with a different handlebar mount. In 2006 it came with a very adjustable mounting unit. The newly-ordered model came with a cheapish plastic part that is zip-tied to the handlebars. It seems to work acceptably well, but is much less attractive and usable than the 2006 version. It is still TOTALLY worth the $10 I paid for it, but I would have rather paid $15 and had a better mount. I still recommend this unit."
1,Display went dead/pixelated in a few months,"The cycle computer seemed fine initially. After a couple months of limited use by my 12 year old, the screen faded and you could see only bits and pieces of the LED display. He even kept the computer inside the house after each use. I changed the battery and fiddled around. But that still didn't fix the problem. I am looking to see how to return the item, but since it is a few months old, I am not hopeful."
1,Junk,"Worked OK for a few months, then suddenly quit. Buy a cyclometer from CatEye, much better quality starting at about $18."
1,Bad Batch?,"I bought this product and this first time I used it worked great, but the second time it was only on for five minutes and the screen got all screwy. So I figured maybe there was just a start up battery in there. But changing the battery didn't help either. I was rather disappointed. I was so excited to be able to keep track of speed and distance but the product doesn't even work correctly. I may have just got a bad machine, who knows."
3,Too much work!,"I spent entirely too much time trying to install this little gadget on my bike. The directions were terrible! Not very clear at all. I actually used the reviews and pictures on here to help me install it. After spending an hour or so on it, I came back and figured out how it works. The cable ties are not very tight- they also have to be put on the correct way to work at all. I'm still not sure if this gadget even works properly! I bought one for my boyfriend as a gift, so his should be much easier to install now that I've gone through the process. I would not buy this again, since the time it took to figure out was entirely too much. However, I still give it 3 stars, since for $10 it is a pretty decent device. Next time, I will purchase something wireless."
4,OK - but takes careful adjusting,"For the price I figured I can't go wrong if it didn't function completely. I own a Schwinn Cruiser and figured I'd stay with a Schwinn product. The adjustment to get the magnet you mount on the spokes (which are angled) to be read by the reader on the fork is, well, rather arduous. I mean c'mon - 1 mm distance max. That's about as thick as a business card! And since the spokes angle away towards the rim - only one side of the round spoke magnet can be that close - the other (top side) is farther away. So sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. SO, I adjusted the spoke magnet so the lower portion slightly ticks (rubs) the sensor on the fork when the front wheel spins. After riding for a several miles (about 10) the ticking went away (due to wearing of both contact points) and now all is well. Be patient and you'll get 'er to work."
2,Returning it.,"I was very excited to get this unit, but I did not even get the chance to use it since the magnet could not be installed on the wheel. I've called Schwinn in hope to get the part, but they asked me to ship the unit back, so I have decided to return it directly to amazon. I'm sure it's a good product, but I couldn't use it, hence the review.I bought another one, so I shall leave a feedback for the other product. :P"
4,"Once installed, is very nice","As a lot of other reviewers have mentioned, it takes a while to get this set up. Take your time and it is straightforwrad, you just need to experiment with the magnet and sensor placement.When sold by Amazon, it comes in the retail packaging with twist ties to hold it to the frame, which I find important to mention because the first time I bought it from ""NorAm International Partners"" fulfilled by Amazon, and it was in a generic box, missing the ties and even the magnet -- clearly defective so I returned it. So buyer beware!It isn't wireless like some, but comes with plenty of cord in case your handlebars are high. On my wife's bike they are not so I used some wire-ties to manage the excess cord and wrapped it to the brake lines. Overall, the functions it provides are very useful."
4,Good Product. Good Price.,"Not nearly as difficult to install as others have said. Works fine. A little tedious to clear data for your next ride, but overall a solid product."
3,Item too fragile.,"Item is a good product. However. days after installing the product on my mountan bike the wiring broke. This item may work better for other types of biking i.e. road and X country. Recommend wireless bike odometer for mountain biking.Also, did not like the odometer's install method of strapping. Straps were cheap and it was impossible get the odometer secure. Loose fit likely subsequent to wiring being striped from unit."
4,Not as complicated as it appears at first,"We were quite baffled at first, not by the installation but by the data readings. But once we realized that the icon changes to indicate the different readings, it made more sense. We've only used it once, but it was great! I'm buying a second for another bike right now. Happy Trails! :)"
3,bike computer,Too many functions for this old man. I still cannot get it to record my mileage. It does not give my tire size when you are setting it up.
5,Very easy to program and install. Works GREAT!,The Schwinn Bike Computer was easy to program and install. Works GREAT! Now we know the distance and calories we burn while riding. A great value at a reasonable price.
4,Great trip computer for a great price!,"Good quality, screen is big enough. It took me a while to figure out the sensor and magnet deal - had to keep moving the sensor and magnet up and down on the wheel until it starting reading the speed. Finally got it to work and has not stopped working accurately since then! The only complain I have is that the manual is incorrect and does not provide sufficient info."
2,The magnet does not attach to the wheel very well,"Very cheap; you get what you pay for. The magnet on the wheel has a flimsy plastic screw that bends easily and does not stay attached very well. It kept slipping and get twisted in a way that wouldn't allow it to work before finally falling off completely. Then the cover of the computer fell off. Probably ok for someone not serious about cycling and just wants to try a bike computer out, but it doesn't have much reliability."
4,already broken,"This computer is GREAT! I used it the first time and was thrilled with all of the information it provided. I got home, propped my bike up (since I don't have a kickstand) and my bike fell over. The handlebars jack-knifed when it hit the ground and broke the cable to the computer. So, now my computer no longer works. I'm hoping a little electrical tape will fix the problem.... So, the computer is GREAT, but make sure your handlbars don't turn to the point of breaking the cable when you install it."
3,I wish I could get it to work...,"I loved that this thing has so many functions, unfortunetly it is a little tricky to get working. I still haven't been able to set up though. I'm going to have to take it to a bike shop to get it set up. :/"
3,Fine little computer,"The resetting is where I have to poke around again a couple of times to remember how it was, not all that user friendly but it is simple to use. But overall I like all the functions"
3,Bike Computer,This is a bit small. I do wish it would be larger. It does have a lot of functions. Just small I need my glasses to read.
4,"Works good, difficult to set up.","This device is useful for the casual biker who just wants to know how fast they are going and how far. Resetting the trip info is tedious and I often have to look back at the instruction manual to remind myself what sequence of buttons to push. If you don't care (I don't) then you just leave it alone, and use it for a speedometer and clock. Also has temperature feature which is handy so you can realize how hot or cold it is while you work up a sweat."
4,Does the trick,"Nice, cheap, simple bike computer.I bought two of these and wanted to use them on our trainers in the basement. So that meant back wheel. Unfortunately the cable provided is just barely long enough to work. It wasn't long enough to go from back wheel to handlebar. I had to go on the horizontal cross member, right in front of the handlebar pivot point. So I essentially have to look down between my legs to read.But it actually works out well there, and I pretty pleased with it in general."
5,does the job,I chose this computer for the price and because other bike computers don't have the temperature. Have had this item for over 2 years and have had no problems. Original battery still in use. Commute Daily 20 mile roundtrip.
4,Easy to use,I ride multiple style bikes and needed to see just how effective my exercise program is This was easy to set up. the digital display is large enough to see safely while biking along.
1,Good for the first few days,"The Schwinn 17-function bike computer is great once you get it hooked up initially. However, after a few days (or longer, pending how much you ride), errors start to rear their ugly head. At first, it was selectively giving readouts, with no alteration to the sensor/magnet. The next day, it was not giving any readouts whatsoever. Upon rearranging the entire setup, I received about 5 minutes worth of riding readout before the cable actually snapped. Yes, I followed the precautions regarding cable tension as a result of turning handlebars, and as a result, gave the cable plenty of slack to spare. I believe it was somewhat worn from the weather conditions (wet pavement).This bike computer is nothing more than a $15-20 lesson that you should not go cheap when it comes to cycling computers."
3,Good basic computer,This is a good unit. It has more features than most people will need like a fat counter but it breaks up a long boring commute. I like the temperature feature. It was very easy to set up but is extremely difficult to reset every function to zero after your ride. The screen blinks all over and it seems just by luck that you manage to reset it. I'm sure there's a logic to it that I just haven't mastered yet. The instructions are very basic and not much help. But I would still recommend this unit. It's hard to beat its cost for the number of functions it offers.
1,SO disappointed,"I would give it zero stars if I could.I am just now able to get back on a bike and thought this would be a great addition. After over 5 hours (over 10 days), we could not get it to work and have returned it.I would suggest buying something else. I am currently taking more time to look this time. I thought with the name Schwinn that it would be a much better product!"
2,Broke after 2 months,This broke after 2 months of limited use but I will try again since it is so cheap.It did work well up until the one time I dropped it.no more display
1,Calling all computer software analysts,This is the speedometer for you. Particularly if you need to know your caleric expenditures real time. And you ride in US and England intermitently so you can chane the 22 functions to kilos.
1,Doesn't work,Two words - Doesn't work. I can get it programmed but the computer does not recognize rotations of the wheel. Stay away from this one.
1,Still can't get it to work,"I could not figure this out. I couldn't get it to work. I still have it in a bag because I can't bring myself to throw it in the trash. It's horrible to try to change the info on the screen. I just can't work it at all, and I'm a computer professional. And, I never could get it hooked up to the bike. I give up on this. I say just use your phone app, it's a whole lot easier."
2,Lost Sensor Piece - I need a replacement,The sensor piece came off while my son was riding his bike and got lost. Is there any way to get a replacement? I would not like to have to order the computer again. Any recommendations?
2,Quick released itself in the middle of a ride,"This was really a nice bike computer, but didn't last more than a few months. After the first month, the LED was dead. During the third, it jumped out of its quick-release bracket while I was going downhill at 30 MPH, bounced once, and was run over very loudly by a truck. As the cheapest thing on the market, I think this makes a fine throwaway computer (I left it on when I parked my bike, because I wasn't worried about theft), but this is definitely not the same quality as a more expensive bike computer. It took my last one (a Giant) four years before it died."
3,Great AFTER I replaced the wire,"Initially after install, I could not get the miles per hour function to work...re-read the instructions several times and was about to return the unit when I tried something radical.I cut the wire about 3 inches from the device and 3 inches from the sending unit mounted on the fork. I spliced in a two wire patch of the same color, sealed the connections with shrink tubing and after that it worked perfectly. All I can assume is wire was bad. Once this rather significant problem was corrected, it works perfectly...I love it. BUT, it should have worked right out of the box. Hence my rating of 3 stars."
3,Nothing to Write Home About,"I'm incredibly underwhelmed by this Bike Computer. It's very, very small. It also doesn't seem to have an easy reset for time or distance, so I have to remember where I started each time. If I had to do this again, I would've chosen a different bike computer.Also, it's worth noting that I used this on my spin bike, so it is possible to do that."
4,Beware....these are NOT wireless,"I thought this bike computer was wireless after reading thru all of the product description. They are NOT wireless, but they work great for my kids' bikes, and they were affordable."
4,"Works great, affordable","I bought this bike computer for a big bike trip in August, after reading some of the other reviews. The one that was most helpful said to ""read the directions"". And, they were right. It's actually very easy to set up - just read the directions. It has a lot of functions that are easy to read. The one tip I will add is to make sure you put the magnet and the counter very close together. When I first assembled it, it wasn't registering so I moved the counter VERY close to where the magnet rotates around. That solved it. Good product, great price!"
4,Schwinn Computer works well!!,I hooked this up on my moutain bike only took a few minutues and came with all parts. Make sure you input the correct wheel size to make this accurate. I just completed a 40 mile ride and really like this for the price I have never used another bike computer before but this does all that I need I don't see any reason to buy a more expensive unit. The screen is easy to read even in sunlight just set to to scan and go.
4,Great Accessory,"Having this bike computer has really inspired me to take my bicycling to another level. The easy to read screen shows accurate information about my time and speed. The distances I bike between are usually fairly similar, but it's been a blast trying to beat my personal bests for time getting there! Very easy to set up and doesn't take up too much space either."
2,Breaks easy,"Pro's - lots of information, easy to install. Con's - The wires which connect the display to the sensors on the fork are very very thin and flimsy. So fragile that when my bike accidentally dragged against something in the garage, they ripped out. The amount of copper in those wires was so small, that it was impossible to reconnect them. Also, the display was quite sluggish - it would update say every second so there is no smooth and rapid display of increasing speed - worse so in cold (< 40F) weather. I replaced mine with Cateye ED300."
2,Only Works Half the Time,"This little monitor seemed like a great purchase. Sadly, it only seems to work half the time and despite following the instructions, half the time it doesn't reset properly. Spend the extra money and get a nicer bike computer."
2,Programming is a pain. Easy to accidentally clear.,"It's a good computer. My rating is impacted by the user interface, which feels like it was engineered in the first days of VCRs and digital watches. Programming is a pain. Easy to accidentally clear."
2,Battery didn't work and couldn't find another,"My son was so excited when he got this but then he could't get it to work and could not find a place that sold batteries like this one. If he could get it to work, he probably would like it."
1,More junk from China,"I spent about 20 minutes installing the mounts and wire, which went ok. Then I tried to set the wheel diameter, km/mile, on the computer. The device endlessly returns to the factory defaults. This is another unworkable, useless, mindless, incomprehensible, worthless and frustrating piece of cheap plastic from our out sourced factories in China. Save your money and time. Buy something else, ANYTHING."
4,"Great Value, Does the Job I need.","I bought one of these for one of my bikes because I didn't want to spend a lot on a computer until I figured out better what features I wanted and did a little more research.The computer's controls are not the easiest to use but after figuring it out, it works fine. I found the main features I use and need are; 1. Current Speed, 2. Trip Distance, 3.Moving Time, 4. Average Speed and 5. Time of Day. All these features work great and get the job done. It's worked so well for me and I found I didn't really need additional features so I bought 2 more of these for my other Family Bikes.Pros:- Good Value- Seems Accurate- Tracks Moving Time (i.e. it stops timer when stationary for a few seconds)Cons:- Can be a little hard to read in some light conditions.- Sensor may need a little fine tuning to get the spacing correct.- Controls and instructions are not the greatest"
5,Great value for the price,"It takes a little bit of time (5-10 min) to find the best position for the magnet-sensor pair, but that's about it. Easy installation, large and clear display. Input of parameters is simple.For it's price, it is definitely best buy. And for most people, it will also be more then enough in terms of functionality."
5,Very satisfied,"The Schwinn bike computer has made our bike rides a lot more fun. It tells you everything you need to know or want to know about a bike ride. It's very durable(I've dropped it a couple of times). Very easy to install and set up. Very low price too. You can spend a lot more, but why? Highly recommend!"
2,Schwinn Bike Computer,"This SCHWINN 20 function bike computer is cheaply made and very difficult to work with. The instructions are poorly written and hard to follow. And finally, it's very hard to use because it is so cheaply made. Unfortunately, after I bought one and attempted to install it, I got another one for a Christmas gift. Just my luck."
3,"Good product for the money, but it is challenging to configure it","It is a good product for the money. It does what it suppose to do. I will give it a 5 rating for the functionality. However, the configuration part is the most challenging. First, the speedometer did not move at all. It took an hour of playing to get the magnet align correctly to display the speed. More installation pictures can definitely help. I had most trouble with entering the correct tires diameter & distance between the tires. Once I figured it out, it did not give correct mileage. Also, It gave random speed that did not reflect the actual speed. After the 3rd ride and putting about 20 miles, some how it started to function correctly (correct mileage and speed)."
2,Bike Computer Set-Up Tedious,"Schwinn 17-Function Bike ComputerThe two computers I bought for our bikes seem to function the same. They do not zero out at the end of the trip as they should. Each time we return from riding we scroll through the readouts for calories burned etc., and then hold down both buttons to zero out everthing for the next trip. This also eliminates your wheel size, age, weight, time of day etc. I have become fast at reentering this data, but there should be a better way! Also, the items for weight, age, wheel size etc. are not labeled on the screen so by trial and error you learn which is which and when to enter them. I love being able to see how many calories burned and the speed I've achieved, but the designers sure missed the mark where the term ""user friendly"" should have been applied to set up the device and zero out the results. Other than that, they're cheap and work ok."
2,... Do you like setting your watch every time you use it?,This is a great bike computer. It does everything very clearly and easily. But I can't seem to clear the previous trip without completely resetting the entire computer. That is beyond annoying and time wasting.
3,"Cheap, and the wire is too short for me.","It's cheap. It's hard to argue with $10. But it looks cheap too.The cable is too short for me on my recumbent. It won't reach to where I can easiy see it on my handlebars. Instead, I mounted it sideways on the frame, but all I can really see is the speed.It's not a total loss, however, because it does log distance and average speed and time and max speed. I can review that later, off the bike."
1,Would not buy,"For $10, you get what you pay for. You get a basic computer that does what you need it to, and will get you by. It's very... ""not bad"". It's a little hard to read anything but the speedometer (biggest text) while riding -- not too bad, but requires a bit of concentration. Also it's got way too many modes IMO.That said, for $10, you can't really go wrong. Not bad at all for the cyclist who's trying to save money. It works as advertised, but you get what you pay for.UPDATE:After a summer of riding with this computer, it fell off one day while I was riding. The plastic mechanism to hold the computer to the mount must have snapped off, making the entire thing useless. I would recommend getting something of higher quality so that you won't have to replace it after a few months. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."
2,limited,"This device is cheap, so it lives up to the adage, ""you get what you pay for."" Not totally useless, but not great either."
1,I got what I paid for...,"I was hoping to get a name brand product cheap.. What I got was a cheap product from a name brand. I installed it on my bike, set it up and proceeded to ride. Five minutes into the ride it stops receiving data.. Reset it on the next ride.. same thing. Adjusted and re-adjusted the sensors many times with the same result.. I'll know better next time.."
1,This unit only works intermittently.,I got a great review on line for this product. It did not meet my expectations since it only worked 25% of the time. It is a piece of s***.
4,Great for price,"Great for the price. A little tricky to navigate through the features, but not too bad. Only real problem was it stopped working once when it was raining, but after it dried off it started working fine again. Also, it was very easy to set up and install."
1,Item Arrived Defective,"I chose to order the Schwinn 17-Function Bike Computer because it was advertised as being able to record the two main functions I needed it for - track MPHs and total distance.Unfortunately, the computer arrived without a working computer. The screen never turned on, and was defective. I even went to the store to purchase a new battery in case it was simply a battery issue, but it still didn't work. I would not order from this seller again. Buyer beware!"
4,Read on!!!!!,"Just recently installed this on my bike (well my boyfriend did). At first I thought I got a dud cause it wasn't reading when we turned the wheel. Turned out my boyfriend installed it incorrectly. So when he corrected it, it worked so well! And I took it for a spin for a few minutes and it worked so well I was elated!!!!! The only problem with it I would say is that you have to reset it everytime if you want a fresh reading on it just like in a car. But since I don't, then I just let it read on so I know how many miles my bike is riding for its life. If I want my progress, Ill write it down. No big deal. That's how you track progress anyway."
3,Where's the number's,"Purchased Schwinn bike computer after reading many reviews. Received quickly and easily installed. It works great except for one problem. The large number (speed) stays on top. Your small numbers stay on the bottom as you scroll through the different functions. They are very difficult to see, impossible while riding. After your ride you can look up any of the functions you would like. There are others on the market. Hope this helps."
1,piece of junk,"This Schwinn 20 function bike computer came in, I set it up and on the first bike ride it stopped working. Could someone please tell me how to return it!?!? I can't believe I spent that much on something that quit so quickly. Resetting it is not working! I am not happy!!!"
1,Didn't work out of the box; returning,"I had high hopes for this device, but I couldn't get the computer to turn on within minutes of opening the package. I thought it might be a bad battery but I put a different one in and had the same problem: no LCD readout on the device. Very disappointing."
1,Defective out of the package,"After reading the other reviews I expected to have to monkey around with setting the magnet and sensor distance to get the to work correctly. After fiddling around with it for 15 minutes, I gave up and called the company. The representative told me to wave the magnet back and forth over the sensor to make sure it was working correctly. I did and nothing happened. She said I had a defective unit. I would think they would do a quality control test of this at the factory. I will be returning this item and looking to purchase a different brand."
1,disappointed in schwinn 17 function bike computer,"I bought this so that I could tell how many miles I was riding and how long I had been riding while riding. I found it extremely difficult to initially set up even using the instructions. Once I did set it up, it would display my speed while I was riding, but I couldn't get anything on the bottom line to show time or distance, it just blinked the same number over and over. When I got home, I was able to figure out how far I went and the time I was riding, but couldn't figure out how to zero it out for next time. It also kept falling off the bike. The last time I used it, it flew off when I hit a small bump and I didn't even stop to retrieve it."
1,"Very finiky, unreliable","I love Schwinn stuff. I have a Schwinn bike, a Schwinn helmet and a Schwinn bike pump, so I figured that I couldn't go wrong with a Schwinn bike computer. How wrong I was. I remember when bike computers were really expensive, but at least those worked. This requires the magnet to pass, according to the directions, within 2mm of the sensor. And given the flimsyness of the quick-ties they give you to attach the sensor, and the potholes on basically every city street in America, that's almost impossible to maintain. It's also not very accurate (I tested it with my car, the speedometer was off by quite a bit), and before people go accusing me of not setting the wheel diameter right, believe me, that was the first thing I checked, and adjusted, and adjusted again. It just led to varying degrees of incorrectness in either direction. Unless you want a clock and thermometer on your bike, skip this product."
4,2000 miles and counting,I've been using this computer for over 2000 miles and it's still working great. I can't believe a cheap thing like this has lasted so long and I haven't even changed the battery yet. It's a good product.
5,"Love it, easy to use, packed with features","A bit tricky to install but not too hard, dont despair! Makes bike riding a lot more fun!"
4,Pretty good...,"This bike computer has lots of useful functions on an easy to read screen. Installation was a breeze. The only problem I had was that the default settings suggested in the manual did not work well. The odometer was off by over 1000 feet per mile. I used my GPS to ""dial it in"". The manual included a conversion formula but it was only good used with Millimeters and my tapes only measured inches. So this would get 5 stars if not for that problem. However now that I have figured out the correct code for the wheel input, I am going to purchase a second unit for my wife. For all its functionality, the Schwinn Bike Computer is a great value for the money.Update: I purchased a second unit for my wife but after I installed it, I tried to configure it but the right button was inoperative. To Amazon's credit, I received a replacement within 24 hours and it works perfectly. Cheers to Amazon for their excellent Customer Service!"
5,"great price, works great","1/2 the price of local stores. works great. I like that I can check the time so I can determine if I need to pedal faster so I'm not late.... Then, as I pedal faster I can see how fast I'm going while I contemplate how I wish I would have left earlier so I could enjoy the ride more. If I wanted to, I could also figure out the fat I'm losing by the calories, I suppose, but I've never been one to count them... too many better things to be concerned with. I say, just look at your gut to see u if u already used the fuel you ate yesterday or not. I used this computer for 2 years now & have had no problems. My only complaint is the supposed ""backlight""... it gives only a flash of light rather than a steady light. If I knew that, I would have bought the cheaper model without the light"
5,Works great!!!,"The Schwinn 17-Function Bike Computer work great, the instructions are easy to follow, and the large display makes for easy readouts."
4,rough riders beware.,"This is a good, solid bike computer... functionally. It seems to be accurate on all of its calculations (when set up properly) and has many of your desired functions and even some you may never need. The reason is won't get a 5 star from me is that I purchased this to replace a unit the popped off its clip-on mounting bracket somewhere on a particularly rough trail I was riding. You know... the kind where the focus is getting down it alive, not your pace or how many calories you are burning. So a more solidly locking bracket would make this a 5 star."
5,Great product,This was very easy to instal. It took me about 5 minutes and it was on and ready to go. I have tested the various functions and have found it very accurate. And with the cheap price you should definitely get this one if your looking for bike computers.
5,Keeping track of what I need and more.,"The Schwinn Bike Computer is awesome to say the least. It was very easy to install and once programed, it has been a major factor in keeping track of my bike riding objectives. I had looked to other companies but none could give me the same guarantees Amazon does concerning product delivery and performance. This is a product that I would reccomend to anyone who is serious about knowing how far they travil and how fast, along with many other functions. Anyone who trys this product will ask themselves why they waited so long to upgrade their biking experience."
2,"Ok, but weak clip","This is about what you expect from the price range.It functions well enough, though it isn't at all intuitive. However, the clip that connects the computer with the bike is weak. Mine fell off during cycling after only a few weeks."
3,"good product, less than helpful documentation","The computer itself is fine, but the manual that comes with it is confusing and in very small print. I had to reread it several times to figure out that the battery goes in negative-down, instead of positive-down, which is how the battery compartment is marked. (Which made me think the unit was broken)"
2,the weakest of the knockout series,"I also own UFC Knockouts 1 & 2, as well as the UFC Hits DVDs. I would recommend any of those over this DVDIf you are a fan of the UFC, you know the 2002 and 2003 bouts, which this DVD covers, did not have that many true knockouts. instead of Ultimate Knockouts 3, this should have been called Technical Knockouts 1. Out of 18 bouts, there are only 2 true knockouts, and the rest are fight stoppages.Chuck Liddell did a decent job co hosting Knockouts #2, but in #3, there is a female fan introducing the fights. While she is nice to look at, she does nothing for the DVD...I did enjoy the special features which has a lot of the new fighters, and some of the old timers talking about their favorite KO, and KOs in general. If not for this added feature I actually would have been disapointed that I spent money on this."
1,Dont let the cover with shamrock fool you.,If there was a star under 1 I would give this dvd that and that is pushing it. I have all the knock out dvd's and this one is not worth the shipping and handling I paid for it. It was just a dvd to get quick money. Save your money If good morning america ever wanted to air mixed marshall arts on tv in the morning this would be more then allowed thats how bad it is.
2,Too much filler,"I liked the knockouts on this dvd, but having to listen to the female narrate in between knockouts and set up the segments was beyond annoying. She would be better suited for the Home Shopping Network or QVC or something, but I have no interest in hearing her opinions on fighting and it took much of the impact out of this dvd. Just my personal opinion."
3,"Informative, but could be better","This is good video to show the extent to which Cheney wanted to expand the power of the presidency throughout his political career. I used it in my senior government class after a chapter on the executive branch to reiterate terms like executive privilege. However, my students enjoyed the PBS Frontline video ""Bush's War"" much more and it covered much of the same material anyway."
4,CONTAINS A RARE TRACK THAT EXISTS ONLY HERE?,"Although I am not a Yardbirds expert (and I invite one to correct me here), there is a superlative track on this collection that seems not to exist elsewhere on CD: ""XYZ"", a 2:42 (Jeff Beck) instrumental, credited ""Beck, Dreja, McCarty, Relf, Samwell-Smith"". ""XYZ"" does not appear on any of the excellent Japanese K2HD & Repertoire remastered releases, which are all loaded with extra tracks and rarities."
1,Stiff and rough fabric,One hundred percent cotton. Lousy cotton. Stays stiff and roughl even after several washings No fabric softener seems to help.
1,"not bark colored, these are olive","thin, poor fitting, made in mexico and misscolored. These are olive drab, not bark and are along the lines of kmart or walmart quality, not worth more than $15."
3,Pretty Good Pants,"I like these pants because they are comfortable and they look good. I also like the pockets. However, I could do without the hammer loop, which is no problem because I just cut it off with a pair of scissors (I use a standard hammer holster with a steel loop that I purchase from sears to hold my hammer). The cloth hammer loop is really worthless as it requires one to fumble with it when trying to insert the handle of the hammer. Also, the hammer loop tends to snag onto anything in the area. The real problem with these pants is that the knees just do not hold up. Within a year, the knees will be holey. The ""rip-stop"" material is not all that it is made up to be. We had that stuff in our camouflage utilities in Vietnam and, in a short while, the clothes were just shredded (especially the knees)."
3,Tight knees..,"These pants fit and feel great, that is if your casually walking short distances or need to be able to squat on the job. After wearing these pants for 12 hours and having meetings sitting for hours at a time then walking the plant I started to get cramps in my knee. The denim version of these pants are better in flexibility and fit at the knee."
4,Great jeans,"I work 14+ hour days outside at a rock quarry weather its 100 degrees or 0 degrees, rain, snow or shine. These pants are great. Im a big guy and these pants fit and feel great. During the summer they keep you cooler then jeans will and stand up against plenty abuse. That being said the only downfall is they are not very fire proof (nor are most jeans) but i use a torch and weld alot at work. I did catch these pants on fire a couple of times but thanks to quick reactions from my co-workers my butt cheeks only suffered minor burns. Would not recommend for a full time welder but for every thing else...Perfect!!! I plan on buying more for this summer because last summer in KS was brutal and looks to be another hot one> Thanks Wrangler for thinking of the men and women who have to sweat for a living."
5,Husband loves them,"This is the first pair of jeans I have boughten for my husband that he actually loves. He is a carpenter. He said they are very roomy everywhere, and a good jean for summer because they are light and don't stick to him. He has had them for about a month and not a single rip yet! Trust me, he rips jeans all the time. I am interested to see what happens once he does tear them, but for now, love them!"
4,Riggs Workwear pants,"These are the best pants I've ever had for a long time. I wear them as a dress pants, and on the farm. They're comfortable and they have the right size e.g. 37 for waist. I only give them 4 stars, because I've noticed after a year they would fry between the legs, by the seems. I've also noticed that the quality went down as well. I bought these pants when they first made them years back from ""Gemplers"". It was the only place where you can get them. Now they're available every where and that's when I noticed the quality issue. My first 2 pairs lasted the longest. All of the new ones, they're rated for about a year. These are the only pants I wear now, I've got 9 of them over the years and there is 2 brand new in my closet. I've told all my friends about them, and they went and got some when they went on sale from ""Menards"". They had the same issue with the frying between the leg as well."
1,Wrong sizing label,"The waist size of these pants is several sizes too small. I wear a 32, and tried 32, 33 and even 34. Even the 34 was more like a 31. I gave up on these pants. Its unfortunate since they seem like a good alternative to jeans if they only fit."
1,wrong product sent,"I requested a battery for a Motorola V551. The wrong battery was sent. When I tried to order the correct battery again, none were available in stock. I sent back the original battery sent, and I am waiting for a refund."
5,Great,This battery is great especially if you always leave your phone on. It last for what seems like to be a week at a time and is great as a spare. I would recommend it to anyone who uses their motorola often
5,A Shame This Book has Been Ignored,"It is a tragedy that certain books, though they are excellent, are soon to be forgotten, whether they are fiction or nonfiction. This is such a book. It is unique because West examines treason carried out by individuals of different political persuasions. She originally attended and wrote on the trials and the background of British traitors of World War II, a much neglected topic, the most famous being Lord Haw Haw. On the heel of the trials of pro-Nazi traitors, came a series of pro-Communist traitors spying for Russia. She examines all the traitors' backgrounds and how they differed from each other as well as their common elements.On a peripheral note, we also get a glimpse of the views, thoughts, and preoccupation of that earlier time, the lifting of war rationing in Britain, and the fact that the British incompetence at guarding secrets was skillfully exploited by the Russians in order to drive a wedge between Britain and the United States."
2,Nothing much,"I have read a few of H G Wells stories. These ones I have no idea where they come from. None sounded like they came from Wells.Science fiction is fiction but it's suppose to be scientifically believable in some way, none of these stories were good fiction or good science.The acting was poor. Special effects poor."
2,"Good show, Bad recording","The show is interesting and well-acted, but the quality of the recording is terrible. There's a sort of vibration in the picture that comes and goes, which really doesn't seem to be from problems with the player or the disc, but from defects in the recording. Watching gave me a headache! But I want to see what happens next, so I see more headaches in my future..."
4,A bit better than expected,"I bought this DVD for one reason, to see what Nicholas Rowe ofYoung Sherlock Holmeswas up to. Being part of the RHI Movie Weekend club I wasn't expecting too much but this turned out to be okay. The special effects are a bit over rated but the historical costumes and settings are well done. In general this has the making of good family viewing, I reccomend parents watch first and decide if the creature in one story is too frightening for their children.For Nicholas Rowe fans this is reccomended as so little of his work makes it to America. He's even more charming and lovable than Holmes and there's a hint of a sense of humor. His best parts are in the first and last stories, you can fast forward through most of the movie and not miss anything."
5,Charming,"I was pleasantly surprised by this miniseries, it was better than expected, in fact, it was great. I watched it in 2 nights instead of 3 as I was having trouble giving it up. I just kept watching, thoroughly absorbed by the story and the characters. They could easily have kept going and made an entire series from this. Loved it."
4,H.G.Wells,When you start reading sci fi he has to be near the top of the must read list. You could read his books for weeks and not see the last one...
3,Boring... Not to my expectation ..,"I was exciting when I received my DVD, but was abit disappointed cos too much dialogue :(The movie trailer was contradicting ..."
3,"Okay, for something a bit different","It was alright, and the price was fine, so I'm not sad I bought it, but I wouldn't say that it was the most exciting show I've seen and it didn't really take one on the journey you expected to go on. So, hey, not bad, but not the best film out there.Didn't include a summary, because others out there have done that."
1,The Infinite Worlds of H.G. Wells,I am very disappointed that DVD does not have closed captioned.I feel that I ordered for nothing. Sigh! You have following FCC laws.;( ... :(
3,Silly mistakes spoil end result,I was quite enjoying these vignettes of Wellsian science-fiction until close to the end of the second episode when an officer in the Royal Navy saluted indoors (not done) and did so with his left hand (ridiculous). Surely somebody could have checked out Naval protocol on such an elementary matter as saluting?Kate Cummings (ex-Royal Australian Navy)
5,Excellent Hallmark Mini Series,"This is an Excellent DVD. An exceptional Bargain for what you get. The mini series presented contains over 4 hours of adaptations of H.G. Wells short stories. The 3 part series contains 2 stories in each but the fun part is, they are all told as a sequence with H.G. Wells relating his rememberance to some one else. Costuming and Set/sites is perfect. All the actors involved do an excellent job on their part. This is one DVD I'll enjoy watching again and again."
4,punch,"This electric paper punch is somewhat slow on small batches of paper, but is a time-saver on larger stacks. I use it numerous times daily, and it is sturdy enough to do the job for which it was purchased."
2,Quit,"I found this machine convenient and effective for about 3 weeks. It simply stopped working, no action at all when button is pushed, and I cannot determine the cause."
4,Don't overfeed it!,"From my wife, who bought the machine: I use it at work because I have so many handouts for my students and I have them keep everything in a 3 ring binder. I've accidentally put in more than 30 pages and the machine goes nuts - it won't stop punching holes, and I have to unplug it and let it reset itself. The kids get a good laugh from that. Otherwise, it's doing its job well."
4,Good deal,"Item works as expected. A little noisy, but not more than I thought. Actually arrived the day before tracking said, about 3 days after I ordered it, and I live in the sticks, man."
1,Would not release the paper once punched,"I probably got the one defective machine on the planet, but this thing would not let go of the paper once I punched it. There was a lot of tugging and frustration involved in the hole-punching process.It didn't help that when I took this out of the box a few pieces of punched paper fell out, indicating that this had been tried and used before. I hope the seller damages this thing out and stops sending it to people."
4,Worth the Noise Too,"Overall it seems to do the job expected. I haven't had a major issues with it yet but one thing is the amount of noise that it makes when punching the holes. At work we had a similar product and it wasn't nearly as loud. Maybe after being used a little bit more and ""breaking it in"" the amount of noise will decrease slightly. But otherwise, an outstanding product."
4,Grammar Traps,"I liked this book because it provides great examples of common mistakes. The layout of the book is really user friendly. When teaching High School students the easiest explanation is the best. Overall, this is a great tool."
2,Stick with the regular Missing Pieces and save some money,"I think Autograph is one of the most underrated hair bands of the 80s. Being a big fan of their music, I was interested to learn that there was an import version of Missing Pieces that had seven additional tracks on it. I plunked down my $25.00 just to hear those seven tracks. Upon listening to the CD, I quickly realized that five of the seven extra tracks are simply rough demos of songs on their first album ""Sign in Please."" I was dissapointed to say the least. The rehashed songs coupled with a printing error in the liner notes, make me regret spending the cash for this import CD. If you are an Autograph fan, stick with the American version of Missing Pieces and save yourself fifteen bucks."
3,How much you pay that much you get,"I bought this humidor few weeks ago, it does look fine, noting special but i expected this much since it is one of cheapest humidors arround. Only problem is that hydrometer is defected. Readings are unstable so i had to invest a little bit more into hydrometer."
4,good choice,"Great value, solid construction, closed perfectly. I wish it would have the hygrometer visible from the outside."
1,57% Humidity? Epic failure.,"Save your money. The only way to get the humidity level high enough is to dunk them in water. I bought two, along with digital hygrometers and the Ice gel. Seasoned them for two weeks and I still can not get the humidity above 57% in one. The other one is even lower. These boxes weren't any better than the cedar lined boxes the cigars are sold in. I ended up putting the gel, my cigars, and the hygrometers in Glad storage containers. Works like a charm. Seriously, buy some Glad storage containers to keep your cigars in."
3,any instructions at all would help,Purchased this humidor and a tube that you add water to that sets humidity. As this is my 1st humidor ever purchased i really was just going to follow the instructions. Of course i got the humidor and the tube thrown in a box with no instructions what so ever. Weird....
4,Easy and huge humidor,"Thats what I want, a little and beutifull humidor. Its nice for this price. At first i had problems with humidity, it was too low (under 60%) but one week later i got a 70% humidity, and openning it all nights.The humidifier is not adjusted at the factory, but its easy to adjust it, I had no problems. Im so happy."
4,Nice Humidor,A very nice humidor with a good seal and attractive look and feel. Easily stores 40+ toro/robusto size sticks. If you are new to cigars/humidors and don't want to drop $80 this is your humidor. Very nice starter box or maybe golf locker set up.
4,25-Cigar Humidor,"I purchased this humidor along with theQuality Importers Desktop Humidor, Capri-Glasstop. This humidor advertises a 25 stick capacity, the glasstop 25-50. When they arrived the packaging, color (cherry), hygrometer, divider and humistat were all identical. The only difference in the humidors was the glass top in the Capri.That being said, the Capri does seem to have a better seal, but I attribute that to the assembly rather than the product itself. As stated in other reviews, some of these humidors have better seals and maintain RH better than others. As expected the hygrometer is worthless.All in all seems like an ok humidor for the price and expect to have some extra space if you plan to store no more than 25 cigars."
4,Does its job,"This is a very nice piece. Finish looks good and the humidor does a fine job of what it was designed to do. The hygrometer that comes with it seems to be a bit crappy, but I'm not very demanding."
5,Great for the money,"Works great for what I need it for, and keeps my smokes at 68% humidity. Great for your first humidor!"
1,OGRE?,"Having loved The Tin Drum, I anticipated this feature greatly. Having seen it, I would recommend watching The Tin Drum again."
5,Simplistically Funny!,"As the author of ""300 Incredible Things to Do on the Internet,"" I give many speeches. For a little humor, I always include this product. The people in the audience love it. They're so used to high-tech gadgets that this high-tech look-alike makes 'em laugh. Thanks for this PDA.Ken Leebow"
3,short but good,"If you buy this expecting this DVD to be at all similar to Frat Party at the Pancake Festival or Live in Texas, then you have been ripped off. Dont get me wrong, I enjoyed the material on this DVD but it wasn't much. The DVD contains the Breaking the Habit music video, the BTH making the video, and Breaking the Habit Live."
5,So totally awesome! BUY BUY BUY!,"When I first heard about Hoobastank's video for ""The Reason"", I said that if they made a DVD of just that video, I'd buy it. I made the same promise when I heard about ""Breaking the Habit"". I kept my promise, and this is awesome! Not only is the video amazing and the song and band the best ever, but the included cinemanga enhances the experience. It has awesome preliminary artwork, helps describe the meaning of the video, and has awesome profiles of the band members. It's awesome!"
5,AWESOME!,"awesome awesome DVD.really explained the story behind the video, and the book that comes with it explained even more! mike shinoda handwriting *squeals*the DVD was in fantastic condition! although the postman did squash it a bit... grrr.... dfdjkghsdlkugfwoot go Linkin Park!buy this DVD : D"
4,Great Addition from LP,"Not much can be said on most singles, and this is no different, the one thing that can be said or asked, is how hard will Linkin Park work to impress their fans, and this answers it, creating Breaking The Habit is amazing and without a doubt original, it's probably the first single where it does something original, nothing against other bands, but Linkin Park took their talent to the next level. Breaking The Habit is not the best song on Meteora, but it's the best fit for single. I think fans will appreciate and love all the work that went into this single, and all the work paid off, it's definitely one of the great hit songs of 2004."
2,On second thought,"I purchased this item because i couldn't stand taking the big horse pills. After using thi product for a week, I immediately went back to the pill. The taste is horrible even after drinking it with fruit juice there is still an aftertaste. It may be ok for some but I cannot deal with the smell either. It kind of has a pee pee smell (lol) that gets on everything."
1,"Slow, slow, slow and slow","Don't bother with this seller, they don't care about time frame on sending out your item. It's taken about a week for them to even send it out."
2,My doctor did not recommend it,"My husband bought this for me. I'm 25 weeks pregnant and I wanted to switch my prenatal vitamins to a liquid form, I have trouble swallowing big pills and this has DHA and I was so happy to know this vitamins got all I need. I asked my Perinatologist before start taking this vitamins, I am on bed rest with a cerclage and taking progesterone shots so i want to make sure this is a right vitamin to take but the ingredient on this bottle has ""meadowseet"" and I found this:(Avoid use during pregnancy. Meadowsweet may increase uterine tone and might stimulate uterine activity)So, my Perinatologist found similar information and didn't recommend it for now. I may start taking it after I deliver my baby. I don't want to put on risk my pregnancy the herb has 300 mg in each spoon you can read the labels."
3,Eh...I'll stick to the pills I think!,You CAN mix this into your juice like it says BUT it's gritty. My husband once took the Flinstone vitamins and crushed them up & mixed them into my drink.....the result was pretty much the same as this liquid prenatal plus DHA......GRITTY! I'm not a fan of swallowing pills and thought I would try this but it did not work for me. Back to the pills I go!
3,Okay if you like sweet juices,"I took it for the first three months of my pregnancy. Not sure how well it works, but I had to MAKE myself take it in the mornings and evenings. Now I take 6 pills a day, which is much easier for me than this sweet juicy liquid."
4,Big mechs,As title says. good action for the time it was created. it was one of the ones that got me hooked . its been done but its still nice
2,"Not good, overrated","This is my first experience with The Mars Volta, and it doesn't leave me eager to check out their other work. Maybe I'm just not cut out for prog rock (though I do love Pink Floyd), because all this was to me was a bunch of endless songs (when are bands going to realize that making a song 12 minutes long for no discernible reason is pretentious, not groundbreaking?) composed of unmemorable guitar riffs, too much feedback, and unnecessary sound effects. Most of the 12 songs on this album, all of them 4-minutes plus, feel like the band took the opening riff to a potentially good rock song and stretched it out ad infinitum. It's possible that a second listen to this one will change my opinion on it, but it's never a good sign when you spend the majority of the album wishing it would end."
4,"Pure TMV, sans the distortion",I first heard this on Myspace (of all places) Sunday and was pleased. Burned a copy of Deloused back in mid '03 and foolishly pre-ordered Frances on vinyl. Listened to Frances for about a week and gave up on it due to distortion taking up about 80% of the album. So ricockulously glad they did away with most of the distortion from Frances the Mute on Amputechture. I like the feel of Deloused that they dipped back into. Cedric flexes his vocal muscles moreso on this album. We will see a resurgence of fans who were turned off by Frances. Hope to see a good turnout on the tour with RHCP this fall.
2,a bit lost...,"I'd pay Rick Rubin personally if he would come back, produce the next MV album, and finally provide the correct direction this talented band needs."
2,"These guys were ""punk""","Sounds like the singer got his nutz caught in a meat grinder. I love high pitched singers voices but this guy has to go. Music is o.k. but super wanky without enough substance to make it worth the while. Take 'em or leave 'em kids, you know where I stand."
1,Crimson Repeat,"This has all been done before, only with good vocals, by a little band called King Crimson. Is this unchartered territory, I think not!"
1,Worst Mars Volta albumn yet,"I love At the Drive in, and even have a special place for Sparta, and the first two full length Mars Volta albums, but this latest release is not for me. Progressive rock must progress I guess, but the fractured and incoherence of this album make it tough to listen to unless you plan on paying full attention from start to finish, it's more of a auditory pennance. I would pass on Amputechture, it's disjointed and bizarre, even for the likes of The Mars Volta!"
2,at least the disc wasn't scratched,"I bought this thinking it would have the CD case with it. I always look forward the artwork and liner notes, it's part of the whole ""buying an album experience."" Well, there was no artwork, no liner notes, nothing. All I got was the Disc itself in a slim clear case. I was super upset and when I opened the package and it lacked all the necessary Items an album should have. I'm thoroughly disappointed in any Mars Volta fan who would sell this."
3,Pretty good music. Terrible mastering.,"Vlado Meller, I hate you. You can hear the distortions being created by his mastering practices very well on this disk. The compression is extreme in application and ends up making it too loud and creating some fairly audible distortions and clipping. If you listen to music as much as I do these things really grate on you. I might be an audiophile, but I wouldn't call myself one. I just feel very dissapointed with the audio quality on this disk. Because of all of this I actually have a difficult time listening to this disk.The music isn't the Mars Volta's best. De-Loused was musically amazing and compelling. Frances wasn't as tuneful, but it was just as compelling, if not moreso, than De-Loused. This album is even less tuneful and isn't very compelling either. On the shorter tracks the music never gets going, and on the longer tracks the music gets boring."
4,A little too much noise and wailing but...,"I'm not going to cover what others have already done so eloquently. These guys do a great job of keeping my feet tapping. However, some of the pieces continue to sound like the next. Great rhythm section, wow. I have this one, as well as Frances, Bedlam, and Deloused. Similar in tone, similar in noise, but no less persevering in creativity! Great stuff."
4,step up from frances the mute,"I thought this album was a good one. I have been listening to TMV since tremulant first came out. I thought Frances the Mute was good, but it was just too much. I loved Deloused and i think this new on is a proper mix of Deloused and Frances the Mute. TMV is still progressing with their sound and it definatley shows in this album. If you are not an avid listener and do not own Deloused you might want to pick it up and start the TMV experience there. Otherwise, I fell this is a great record. Definatley an easier listen then Frances the Mute."
3,Amputechture in review,"This offering by the Mars Volta is inconsistant. in areas that it doesn't lack musicly it delivers a sonic haunting that stick with you for weeks. Those points are few and far between, not only on this record but in contemperary music in general. The rest lacks focus its kinda like they where trying to hard to sell a new genre, and make a progressive push toward something that they haven't really seen and they can't quite fully explain. It needs more focus."
3,Mixed feelings,"Well, to be honest, I don't know yet, after 3 times running thru it ..... and in fact that's not a good thing, even with the complexity of their music.Both previous releases immediately grabbed me and never let loose.With 'Amputechture' I do detect great musicianship .... but it doesn't do much to me .... it's like there's tons of great parts and sounds, but they don't really fall together and just drift by again withoiut making an impression.Some would call this pure noodeling for pseudo-intellectual nerds .... which was the same criticism I heard following the previous twe releases ..... but this time I kinda get what they mean with that comment.Sorry, guess I'll spin 'Deloused ....' etc some more and leave the new one for when I feel like giging it another try."
4,Poet from the High Country of Colorado,"These are the poems of George Spendley..spoken from his heart and his life's experiences. As a dreamer, his voice has a vision..with words to be written..and a heart to share. He weaves his words together..for the lover..for the seeker..for the wild outdoors..for the child..and for the ""John Denver"" in all of us..in a most passionate and simplistic way. His poetry takes you on a journey from Colorado's mountains to Alaska's rivers..to the sea with God's creatures. George's words brings you home to his life as a father..and of his admiration for John Denver. He blends his heart with passion and pain as love and life crosses between daydreams and reality. Let his words and his heart take you on your own journey...with For The Dreamers.Nancy Godbout-Jurka"
4,Connections Through Poetry,"George seems to have connected with me through his graphic and descriptive poetry. As he embraces the world, his sensitivity is expressed in a record of experiences told in words that are intense and beautiful. One of the characters in George Santayana's 'The Last Puritan' described poetry as ""something secret and pure, some magical perception of lighting up the mind for a moment, like reflections in the water, playful and fugitive"". This is the same feeling I get when reading the poetry of George Spendley. His writing seems to be produced almost involuntarily in a state of emotional tension. He is aware of the most common things, and his actions are connected with the deepest aspects. He treasures his family and friends, reveres life in its beauteous surroundings and wishes to be a part of it as he continues to DREAM...."
5,My Favorite Band Kicks Your Favorite Band's Patoot,DFFD gets better every time I listen to it.Anyone who claims to like Rock 'n' Roll and doesn't pick this one up is a waste of protoplasm. 'Nuff said.
3,Burn baby burn!,"Some great songs, some not so great songs.The cover art is by Wayne Bjerke who, for some reason, is not credited on the record. He also did the cover for Mighty High...In Drug City."
4,Good game,"This game is similar to the pc version. Snood is a puzzle game where you try to clear the board. If you match 3 or more of the same color, it will dissapear.The graphics for the game are ok but the lighting is horrible. I would recomend this game to those who like tetris."
1,A little disappointing,"One thing about this game-- it can be very addicting. A couple things I found frustrating: 1) there is no way to ""undo"" a move. This would come in extremely handy. 2) I wish there was some way to regain some of your lives. I can only get so far on the lives I'm given at the start of the game. 3) It's also frustrating to be on a level and not get a piece you need! Some of the levels start out so close to the bottom that you need a certain piece to get some room, and then you don't get it. Impossibility in a game is kind of annoying. I still found myself playing, despite my complaints, so like I said-- it can be addicting."
3,Fun game with problems,This is the second Snod game that I have ordered because the first kept freezing up on me... they haven't fixed the problem however and that is a disappointment because it is a fun game.
5,I am addicted after only two days!,"I got this game a couple of days ago, and it's the best game I have for GBA. It's a deceptively simple game, the rotating, busy backgrounds sometimes make it difficult to aim accurately, so there's some challenge there. Unlike most of my GBA games, I love the music/sound effects, especially the sounds when you bank off the wall."
3,Awesome but faulty,I was addicted to Snood on the PC so I rushed out and bought it for my GBA as soon as it was available. The gameplay is good except for two complaints: the game locks up every once in a while and there are no high scores.
4,A slow slug fest.,"We have Ray Corson, ex-boxer, a collection of women and thugs, and reliable friends. After being hired to make someone `go away' preferably using a permanent solution, Ray plugs along learning more about the woman who hired him and the men who want to hurt him.The built up-moving through the first 70 to 80 pages--is slow, but the writing is good. The chapters are short and clean. We learn more about Ray, but once or twice Phillips's protagonist is a `little' on the spontaneously, brutal side, not that that hurts the book, but the motivation is not fully explained. We don't see enough of his disgust, if not hate.Ray is still likeable. I'd want him on my side. The writing is good and I'll read more by Phillips."
3,Aiming low,"This is an interesting read with lots of authentic Hollywood ambience, but ultimately the two lead characters are not credible. An ex-boxer, would-be-screenwriter who does menial labor to pay the bills? Maybe. A good-looking crazy girl who can't quite cut it in front of the cameras? There's always been a few of those. But the screenwriter with five drinks in him beating two armed thugs to a pulp? Then joining the mob and getting sent to their favorite tailor so he can intimidate two-bit coke dealers? And then going thru with the crazy girl's plot despite knowing it's a total setup, only, apparently, to teach her a lesson? Uh-uh. There must be a way to update the pulps for 2005, but Mr. Phillips hasn't found it.He's a good writer, and lots of his secondary characters are quite good, but the main story is a knuckle sandwich."
3,An Introspective Shell Scott,"The book would have gotten a higher rating but I didn't like the ending. It didn't make sense to me. The author does skillfully recreates the private eye stories of the late 50's and early 60's. A little more risque than that era would have allowed, but not by much. I like the central figure and thought the secondary characters were interesting. Yes they're stereotypes but in this setting that works fine. I usually like detective stories set in the present but it was fun to read about the golden Los Angeles of the '50's. The author is able to write fluidly using the vocabulary and style of the era. The book presents a look at the fringes of the Hollywood scene which is always fun when well done. I would want the ""hero"" to be a little more like the Shell Scott character, a little lighter and more ironic but that wasn't the book the author was going for. I recomend the book. To my mind 3 stars means worth reading."
3,Ugh...the Seiyuu singers...,"Lacking in the descriptions of this video, this Videotape is the Second ""Hurricane Live"" Series where the Voice Actors sing on stage for 3 of the 5 songs (IMHO, Most Needed Singing Lessons). The rest comprises of two animated songs, and some congrats and such.Out of the 3 live sequences, I prefered only one Live Song; ""Say Yes,"" sung by the Voice Actor to ""Vision"" in the series. As for the Animated parts, ""Burning Highway"" was the lone standout.While an interesting departure from watching a pure Daft Punk Montage, I seriously doubt you'd want to buy the video solely on the songs. ""HL 2032"" is a better buy than this tape.I'll rate this as an Average...still worth a look, but your choice if you want to spend the cash on it."
3,Good service,The funny thing of this order was that after a lot of riggim and rowing the product was not what I wanted. It wasn't their fault it was mine...I wanted the Rainforest piece done by National Geographic and narrated by Denzel Washington. Baka: People of the Rainforest. Thanks anyway!
5,a winner,"My favorite harmonica, but also my most expensive diatonic. Sound is rich and full, and the round corners are easy on the mouth"
1,There are no English subtitles,"This DVD has no subtitle menu, thus NO English. This is a bit of a rip off since this is not clear on product description page."
5,Another one of Taboada's best,"Carlos Enrique Taboada, one of Mexico's most distinguishable directors wrote and directed this masterpiece of Mexican horrors. The film was produced by Estudios Churubusco (Mexico's Hollywood), and the recognizable score can be credited to Raul Lavista (who also did the score for Taboada's Hasta el viento tiene miedo, and, El libro de piedra.I strongly recommend this film to anybody interested in a bloodless and goreless classical horror film that will have an effect on you."
3,Not what I expected,"Be aware that 4 of the 20 patterns in this collection must be sewn on white fabric in order to get the red, white and blue effect. This fact is only revealed on the instruction page buried deep inside the sealed plastic packaging. It may not be a big deal to some, but it severely limits my use of these patterns. I would not have purchased this product if I had known."
5,Great Cat Carrier,"I looked at many in the pet shops within the same price range and none came close to the quality as Jakks Cat Carrier. Plenty of ventilation, strong straps and handle. You also have two modes of putting your cat in the carrier; either unzip the top or unzip the front...which is great if you have a resistant cat! It is also very lightweight."
1,"cat carrier, small pet carrier","Don't buy this. Looks good, but mine collapsed in the middle, pinning my cat inside whenever I'm able to stuff him into it. You should see the scars on my arms. Bad design. Needs a longitudinal stiffiner to keep it from collapsing. I finally threw mine away."
4,"Convenient and lite, but also flimsy","I like the carrier and I would buy it again, but the rods that hold the carrier's shape broke in about five minutes and there was a small hole in the netting when it arrived."
4,cat carrier,I like it however it is heavier than the other cat carrier I possess so I have to put my smaller female in the new one.
5,cat carrier,"cat carrier brown, I will be moving soon and will be traviling on a ferry for 36 hours this is a perfect way to contain my cat when we hit open water and the ride gets bummpy."
5,Both previous reviewers correct in certain ways,"This recording, as previous review notes, was done in 1949. Thesame reviewer is correct in noting, that though a little 'dry'as compared to a more modern recording, the sound on this cd isperfectly satisfactory.Although Heifetz' performance on this cd is wonderful, I mustpoint out that an equally good performance can be found onthe Living Stereo recording of this concerto, which is recorded to much better sound specifications and engineering."
3,Rocky Mountain Hideaway,"This is a stationary scene with moving water, and plants. It is ""living art"" as described however, I thought it would have more than one scene to choose from. Rocky Mountain Hideaway appears to be more like a tropical place such as Hawaii, from the horticulture, than any of the outdoor landscapes that I have seen in the Rocky Mountains. I grew up in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. I think it is relaxing and I like the music and nature sound options. You can either listen to music, music and nature or nature only. The picture is high quality and very picturesque. I will enjoy entertaining with this as a background scene or using the scenery for meditation or relaxation."
3,Good to have,"Useful for protecting your filters, either by stacking several of the same size (like, 58mm neutral density filters of several dfferent strengths, or putting the caps on just one filter in lieu of a plastic case.If you use up/down rings, these can help keep the rings from getting bent in your bag."
4,unique on everyone,"Purchased my first bottle while on vacation at the beach from a little eclectic shop. Loved how it smelled and my husband loved it on me. While camping with friends, I pulled it out as a joke and put some on. (Who puts on perfume while camping, afterall). My friends loved it and the women begged to try it. What what truly amazing is that it smelled wonderful on each of them but completely different on each of them. The guys got into the act as well, and while it was a little too feminine for most of them, it even smelled unique on each of them. Long story short, you have to try this to see if you like on you. Lasts a long time."
4,Smells good,"I like it. If it's too strong for some people, they could try mixing it with unscented lotion or body oil."
4,All the fame of lofty Deeds,"In the absence of the ad hoc bands he'll never outgrow, this is purportedly a concept album in which Mr. Deeds goes to Nashville because he's outgrown his band.The arrangements, early Cash with extras, are as committed as the singing we've learned to assume.Actually, a bunch of songs in which Mr. Langford goes to Chicago because he can't stand Thatcher, and life will never be the same because George W. can do that (also Satan)."
5,3rd Wave Rocking,"This being the 1st text I have read written by Rebecca Walker I am swayed to encourage others to read this novel and to purchase from this site. Read Rebecca Walker because she has provided those who may and may not be familiar with Feminism, gender roles and the crippling effects of patriarchy with a contemporary way to view these issues from which we should be freed."
3,Passable,"Like most collections, this is a very uneven book. Certain essays resonated deeply, while others were hokey re-tellings of childhood events or abstract nonsense.Still, the good essays gave me an insight into a man's place in contemporary society. It made me realize the effects gender roles have on people. As men, we're expected to be the hunters and climb the corporate ladder. The essay by the stay at home dad was very telling in the reactions he got from others. The first essay, about a husband's gift of a one year sabbatical to wife in order for her to write her novel also showed how marriages can fall apart and then come together.It's decent reading, but not something I would recommend buying if you're looking for a totally insightful collection about the inner lives of men."
4,A Worthy Collection,I enjoyed this collection of stories and essays from the men featured in this collection. These are stories from the hearts of men. With a nice line up of authors this is worth the money. You will enjoy.Reviewed byDawnny
4,Fun and not what you wound think,I got this game for my grand kids.So as for a grandmother I had to know how to play it before thay came over.well let me tell you one thing. Im still playing it and they dont know I have it.Well for right now any way.AND IM NOT GOING TO TELL THIM.
1,WORSE THAN MOST LICENSED GAMES,"This game doesn't help in any way to supress the awful memories of Casper: Spirit Dimensions(PS2) and The Bible Game (PS2, Xbox, GBA), it just throws me deep into video game hell where the worst of my worst nightmares reside. This game is flawed in so many areas I can't think of anything good about this game. For one thing, it is way too simplistic, to the point of where it feels like the idiot's guide on how to play a video game. You'll mostly just spend your time upgrading you scare meter by collecting many, many potions. When you finally scare you subject it doesn't feel rewarding even after you collect all those potions, it just makes you angry that you wasted your time on this crappy game. So to keep it short, the missions suck, the controls suck, the camera sucks, the graphics suck, the characters suck, and the enemies suck."
1,A W F U L ! ! !,"Don't waist your money. If you wanna buy a good entertaining game,I'd buy Syphon Filter 1,2,3 or Resident Evil etc. The whole game is a non scary game for toddlers so if you're 7 or older, it'll be a waist to buy this game."
5,Samsung Data Cable,"Counter to other reviews, this cable arrived containing software on a cd. It had simple installation and I was connected via cell phone to the internet in under 5 minutes. It comes with a dialer program which works well. A Note: with Sprint PCS you cannot use wireless web connect when you are roaming - only when connected to the pcs network."
2,Data Cable for sprint phones.,"Although this cable provides easy access to the internet, it's not easy for those folks who own imac's. Mac's are a little more sophisticated using USB connections while PC's are getting around to them and are still using scsi technology. In order to use the data cable for mac's you also have to purchase an adapter (that'll cost you) in order to enjoy the benefits of your hip phone. Signing off Ki"
4,Fun,"A fun book. Likable characters, decent story line. Something a little different, not your standard setting. I've read several of her books and this one did not disappoint."
5,MUST SEE!!,Awesome awesome awesome!! My Husband and I both loved it. It is a great combination of chick flick and manly man movie and it's a true story that makes you want to help. After the movie we search for the petition online and signed it. Also it doesn't hurt that both Clint Black and Lisa Hartman Black both depicted their characters perfectly. A must see for everyone!
5,"still holding on, the legend of cadillac jack","I saw this on TV years ago and loved it, love Clint and Lisa, I have been looking for it ever since, so if anyone knows how I can get a copy to play on Australian DVD player, i would appreciate it."
5,Very Good Movie,"This is a really good Movie I think Clint and Lisa are great together in Movies,I would Highly suggest getting this Movie."
1,Viral Marketing. Get your audience to do your marketing for,"""I'm afraid that if you were hoping this book would provide you with an all-encompassing step-by-step guide on how to create the perfect viral marketing campaign, you will be sadly disappointed...because there are too many variables"". My words, no. A direct quote from author Russell Goldsmith, page 103.Too much tell and not enough show. If I'd wanted theory, I could have bought a college text book on marketing. Nothing new here, and expensive for a 125 page paperback at 14.99 in the UK."
1,The worst book I have ever read,"The title says it all. This book contained nothing of any value, examples of the inane mutterings within include ""email enables us to influence more people than does word of mouth"" Duh! The book(pamphlet) ran to 120 pages of double spaced nonsense, 40 or so of which were taken up by the pointless analysis of his market survey. Had I of written this book I'd of recalled all the copies. The 4 or so hours it took me to read this book would have been better spent polishing my earlobes, or weaving toffee. the Uk price of 14:99 is incredible. In fact this book is so bad I'm placing a dollar inside the pages to encourage someone to take it off my hands at the princely (pricey) sum of 1 cent."
1,Never received.,"I did not receive this item, and only after I contacted the seller myself and asked about it did my account get credited. I felt the seller should have let me know right away that they were out of the item, and certainly they should not even have charged my account."
1,If only I could understand more of the words.,This a Boston band which is destined to only ever be a local band. It's speed metal only without the metal. They use music you could expect to hear on the average grunge CD. The singer is so bad at enunciating as to be incomprehensible and the recording is horrible. The total EP comes in at about 7 minutes. Bargain Bin this immediately.
5,Meow!,"This little red race car bed is adorable and soft! Very tempting to my cats for a nice nap! On the small side for really big cats or bigger toy dogs, but ideal for trim kitties and kittens! I love having a place of their own to sleep instead of on my furniture - keeps the hair down!"
5,Perfect for the cats in our animal shelter!,"Shelter cats want to have a cozy, safe place to hide, from which they can watch the world for a while before deciding if it is safe. This bed, plus the other Home Team beds (shaped like balls), provides the perfect hidey-hole, comfortable, adorable, and easy to clean!Once the new cats relax, they continue to enjoy the beds, using them to play hide-and-seek and ""pounce"". We like to surprise them with fun fuzzy mice or little kitty treats hidden inside from time to time. Sometimes, a pinch of catnip, too... they adore their race car caves and sports ball dens!"
5,Great bed,"I love this bed, I have two yorkies and they can both cuddle in it together, beautiful material, well made, very prompt delivery, I will buy from this dealer again."
3,Useful vs. Interesting: irreconcilable?,"While it contains useful information, this book is in need of a strong-handed editor to pick up on its awkward sentences and mis-spellings (*Nathalie* Zemon Davis?). There's no reason why a useful academic book can't be exciting as well."
3,"The world is ""de colores""",This Cd reflects today's world : fusion and more and more opportunities to share and get to know different cultures. It is also a message of peace and it shows how music can bring people together from different continents. Every track is beautiful and full of energy. It is also the result of a successful community effort to bring back to life a Roman theatre and neighborhood. Also watch the PBS documentary about the project. It really sold the CD to me!
2,WRONG SIZE,"I ordered a size 4/6"" showbox not a 3-1/2x5"". As you can see when I enlarge the picture that shows the showbox, it says 4x6""on the box. That's what I expected. I feel like I was taken and I don't appreciate it. I will not order again. My fear is that I ordered 2 more from different seller's and will receive a 3-1/2x5""instead of the 4x6"". I hope I am wrong. Otherwise, this is a gross misrepresentation and the buyer is taken for a ride."
3,Typical HK movie but not very good DVD transcription...,"This typical HK movie is not the best Wing Keung Chien did. The story by itself is very simple (like many HK movies) but characters are well portrayed. The bad point is that visual FX are below the average and the DVD transcription is really poor (maybe it's my DVD Player and/or my TV ;-). Sound quality is not incredible, just ok but I think it's because the movie is a bit old (1994). Anyway, if you're a HK MadMan, buy it else rent it first...Ooops, about bonus materials : nothing..."
4,One of the best on trading psychology ...,"I've read 100+ books on trading. This is one of the best on psychology. There are 28 chapters and a summary of the main points at the end of most chapters. He talks a lot about risk, money management, discipline, rules, etc. The foreward is written by Alexander Elder which says a lot in my book. The author is British and refreshingly frank with some of his comments. This is one of those books that if you heed the advice, it could save you thousands of dollars and years of frustration. Another book like this is ""Come Into My Trading Room"" by Alexander Elder. I have no connection with either of these authors."
3,Racism is anti-Scriptural--not divorce.,"Gola's book was the first of many I read on the divorce and remarriage issue. It was refreshing to see someone challenge antibiblical tradition, but what floored me was his chapter entitled, ""Marrying Outside Your Race."" His premise was that YHWH created different cultural groups for just that reason--to be different. In his eyes ""interracial marriage"" is a sin. This, however, is not the case.That section of his work ruined the overall content, and caused me to raise my eyebrows as I read it. His exegesis of Scripture was horrific, and I must beg the question if he's a part of a supremacist Christian group.Other than the aforementioned chapter, I found the book to be engaging, and he brings up several issues that are often overlooked by the traditional crowd.My recommendation is to actually buy this book, however. Hopefully Gola will come out with a second edition that deletes the chapter mentioned above."
2,NO to lecture on racial purity,"While the basic premise of the book is sound and valuable, Gola lost virtually all credibility for me when he went off on marrying within your race/ethnic group. I wish I'd read the reviews below before I purchased it."
1,A hodge-podge,"This is not just one of the poorest books about divorce I have read, it's one of the worst written books PERIOD. My problem is not with his conclusions, for the most part. But there is no logic. Verses yanked out of context are strung together to form ""Biblical"" points. He jumps around to multiple subjects on a single page. Or repeats arguments 2-3 pages apart. Statements of ""fact"" are just boldly stated as being ""truth,"" with no scripture or logical thinking to back them up. The single main reason he uses for the totality of the book is, ""God told this to me."" I don't doubt the author's sincerity or motives, it is just a really poor read."
4,Thought provoking!,"Very interesting take on a Christian divorce. Really, a great perspective not often considered today. There are probably a LOT of people (I can at least think of 2 families I know personally) who are suffering in a lost marriage that could do well to give up the ""sacrafice"" and misery to move on to fulfill God's will in their life. But then that is easy for me to say. Can't live someone else's life!For me this book has some thoughts that helped release the burden I felt at wanting out of a bad relationship. I truely believe this to be God inspired and at least worthy of consideration. Divorce is NEVER easy and should always be approached with extreme prayer and seeking of God's will. But the scriptures are often so confusing on the subject. This book helped them to make sense. I highly recommed it."
1,junk,"This item is made in India. The threads are very rough, there are nicks in the finish and imperfections in the metal. It takes a good 10 to 12 'twists' to open it. There isn't any type of lining, so while you twist away trying to open it, your filter is grinding on the rough interior. Not to mention the $7.95 to ship a $10.95 item that weighs 1.6 ounces. I'd return it, but it would cost more then its worth."
3,Clear instructions but no really original recipes.,"I've been looking a long time for a really good home-liqueur book, and this is not it. The ""Getting Started"" info at the beginning is very helpful for beginners -- the authors include details about materials, procedures, and a glossary -- but the recipes themselves cater a little too much to a suburban craft-fair mentality. There are ""qick-and-easy"" recipes using store-bought flavor oils and food coloring (why bother?), and nearly all the recipes across the board are too sweet. That said, there are a few nice ones: a home version of Strega which clearly cost the authors some effort and experimentation, a tasty cranberry cordial and a brilliant elderberry liqueur. A good book for beginners in home liqueur production, but not much new or interesting for serious hobbyists."
1,written to make money,"I tried many receipes from this book, and I am very disappointed with 90% of them. The liquors have no character, are too sweet, and are mostly ""quickies."" What the heck is the point of making a ""home"" cordial by mixing vodka, food coloring, and an artificial flavouring?! Get real, just buy some cheap schnaps for $5, the taste willbe better.But I guess you can expect those results from these authors. At the beginning of the book they admit that they wrote it because of the success of their ""wine making"" book (I think, I am not sure if it was really about wines). They started experimenting, and - voila! - here is another book from the ""experts."" Well, it does not work. Skip this book."
5,great book for inspiration!,"I gave this book as a gift to someone who is creative and loves to make their own liqueurs. Wow! This book has some great ideas- and great places to start. Even if you find a recipe not completely to your liking, it provides inspiration on how to modify or adapt to make the liqueur more to your personal taste. I highly recommend this book. And the orange dreamsicle liqueur..........is great on the rocks! :)"
2,This book is nice...i guess,"Well, I bought this book cus i thought it would be fun, it was only $5 so not a big deal.I was excited because this book said it contained a recipe for Creme de cacao, you can read that on the back cover. ""Recipes Include....Creme De Cacao"" However this book doesn't contain such recipe. You think you would make sure what you put on the cover is included in the book! But I'm not a publisher, so i wouldn't know."
3,"Weak for the series, but not bad, nonetheless.","I'll keep it short and sweet: This item does better with early collectors or pseudo-newbies who know the characters and overall schematics of Ranma 1/2. Hardcore fans will collect it for the sake of completeness, or at least I recommend it for that. It's not altogether an excellent addition to Ranma 1/2, but it's still worth the watch."
1,"Awful kid's movie, where the kids who are jerks are the stars","My whole family hated this movie. It's ""plot"" is that the kids become adults and the adults kids for one day. Two of the kids stay kids and are supposed to be the ""good kids"". But they are both obnoxious slobs that are terrible role models for kids watching the movie. Whoever put this out should be fired."
2,"Slow start, one dimensional characters","Slow to start and not that well done, characters so one dimensional they didn't even attract my kids. The whole family got bored and gave up about 2/3 of the way through."
1,Stupis Movie,"It was a waste of money, adn family time for this movie. It was so dumb. I also didnt like the kids attitudes in this movie. We didn't even finish this movie it was so horrible."
3,Just an OK flick,The movie had a few funny parts but overall it was boring. To me it reminded me of a B rated movie. It is a family movie though with no cussing or fowl language so I will give it a thumbs up for that.
4,Interesting twist,"My ""8"" and ""10"" year old watched this movie five times in two days! They loved it. I enjoyed the movie and it was definitely thought provoking making you think about how this ""opposite"" would affect so many aspects of our lives and world. The acting was a bit cheesy, but lots of fun. I think when kids are so anxious to grow up, to have more control over their decisions and lives that this movie gives them some of that to fantasize about, but also leaves them with the message that they do need to be grateful for the parents that love them and that are (hopefully) lovingly guiding them through life until they are mature enough to embark life's journey on their own. I do highly recommend this film for a fun filled time of imagination for your kids."
4,wine racks,Product arrived on time and in perfect condition; easy installation. Very handy for stemmed glassware.
2,Not large enough for glass bottoms.,"The space in which the glasses themselves hang is not wide enough for the stands of the stemware. Small enough that sometimes our Riedel Syrah glasses get stuck. I would spend the extra money for a better quality product, one that won't potentially break my expensive stemware."
5,The best resource I know of for learning IDL.,"I have been learning IDL for the last 8 months. After reading this book for 2 days it has already answered many of the ?-marks in my head left from reading the IDL manuals. I appreciate the style in which the book is written, i.e. the book provides simple little IDL codes followed by a paragraph on the codes functionality. Dr. Fanning has a knack for writing about the common points of confusion that IDL programmers encounter."
2,Don't waste your money,"I can only assume that the reason this book got so many good reviews is because for so long it was the only book out there on IDL: and compared to learning IDL from the computer manuals anything seems good.My complaints: The author continually introduces extraneous commands into his examples just to show off what IDL can do. He does not explain where these extra bells and whistles come from, and so gives the impression that IDL is FAR MORE ARBITRARY than necessary. This is annoying to say the least, but also makes it difficult to learn the lanquage when you can't understand the complete example. The chapter on color is especially nightmarish: a plethora of commands with very little complete explanation. Programming by rote...."
5,Excellent and sweet CD for children and all the ages!,"Oír cualquiera de las composiciones de ""Cri-Cri"" es toda una tierna experiencia. Su música es preciosa y pegadiza. Su letra es dulce y educativa.Todos aquellos niños y adultos que hablan o están aprendiendo español deberían disfrutar de este CD o de cualquiera de los otros de ""Cri-Cri"". ¡Lo mejor en música infantil en español!"
3,Wrong turn,"Teddy Morgan's previous albums deliver tangy combinations of gutsy bar-band blues and rock, driven by his strong guitar licks, straight-forward Dylanesque vocals and powerful backing bands. FREIGHT, however, represents a change of direction for Morgan, and it nearly derails itself. The mood is more country-pop lite than the rocking Texas blues which marked his earlier efforts and as such, comes off as a blatant attempt for wider commercial appeal. Morgan's songs still have great hooks - as on ""Searching for You"" - but lack the grit of his tunes from LOST LOVE AND HIGHWAYS, RIDIN' IN STYLE and LOUISIANA RAIN. Anyone interested in discovering the obscure but talented Mr. Morgan would be better served by one of those albums and by giving FREIGHT the pass."
4,"Free Music, what a treat!","I received this CD after a night of clubbing. I figured it would probably suck, due to some recent giveaways, but when I listened to this, OMG! I was blown out of my mind! You get a decent variety of tracks, all of them with pulse-pounding beats that are easily to dance too! The best part is, unlike many CDs from Industrial, each track does have a unique feel, so it doesn't get repetitive and monotonous. I guarantee everyone should be able to find at least one track they like, provided you are into either industrial or just seeking something you can dance on the floor to!"
5,Industrial Metal at it's finest,"Well, what can I say? From the hart hitting opener 'Two Face', to the amazing cover of Ministry's 'Thieves', and the hit single 'Alive Again'..this is one incredible debut CD from Hypofixx.It's packed full with pounding bass drums, crunching guitars, and some deliciously distorted vocals that will slap you in the face. I most definatey see a bright future for this band, as it's a shining star in the currently dull scene of coldwave bands.If your a fan of Ministry, Static-X, or Bile, then check out this CD right away. But fans of Metal in general should pick this baby up too, because I guarentee you won't be dissapointed."
1,showing off,"I think this disc is lame unless you are a big Bill Dickens fan. You aren't gonna learn much from these DVDs. The performance sections are great but why would you want to copy that?I don't get the idea of the ""Buddha Roll"". (thick rope underneath the strings......)There's nothing to study, his licks apply to him and should be played by only him.I thought I was at least going to learn about gear in the ""gear"" chapter. To my disapointment he just showed off his many 7, 8, 9, 10, 22...etc. string basses which I will never play nor be able to afford.Do not waste your cash on this DVD!!!"
4,A different perspective,"A well researched and thoughtfully written book, providing a different perspective on Helen. The linkages through out the centuries that is explored here provides interesting ideas for thought. The details of artificats, paintings and available literature and the interesting analysis of their backgrounds and various hypothesis of why and how they were created made the book worthwhile for me. Hope more books of this type comes out."
3,Okay,"This book is good/okay, its super interesting but it doesnt good my focus. I can only read so much at a time and have yet to finish it."
5,"Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore","Helen of Troy: Goddess, Princess, Whore. At first I was not interested in this book, I thought one more book about this historical personality; but after reading the authors newer book The Hemlock Cup, I become enthused about her style of writing and her historical research and her way of presenting it. A fascinating book that uses the historical, mythical Helen of Troy as a vehicle to examine woman,and women and the attitudes towards them through the ages, as related to their use of power, intelligence and sexuality, and the traditional customs and beliefs that existed in different societies and times . I found it a fascinating read,full of historical information, maps to follow,illustrations to explain. For those who love to investigate the past, and what in the past affected us in the present, time well spent."
1,Quality problems,"Stroller arrived with front axle assembly so loose that ball bearings fell out. Instructions are minimal, pictures are too small to show the details they are intended to illustrate. The sun shade support broke the first time we raised the shade. I can only recommend that you not buy this stroller. We bought the other brand (cheaper) and it is great."
4,"great, but wear gloves to fold","This stroller is great for general use and very good for 'all terrain' use on trails with roots, logs, ruts and such. It goes right over everything easily. I've only done a little bit of jogging with it, but it seems to work fine for that too. It also folds down to fit easily in the trunk of our car. The only thing that I hate about it is that if you are not extremely careful, you lose skin, and sometimes flesh, when folding it up, as it tends to pinch. I do not care for the lack of padding or a good place to put a water bottle and sippy cup, and the harness is kindof a pain to adjust properly, but these are relatively minor complaints considering how useful this stroller is."
1,Poorly designed piece of junk,I've got this carriage for over a year and I'm totaly unsatisfied !The carriages weight center is very far back therefor it has a tendency to flip backwards (especially when your child pushes his/her back against the seat)!It is also very poorly designed for travelling since it takes up lots of space when folded. I have to take the front wheel off every time I try to put it in the car trunk. It is also relativly heavy !The bottom bag is also poorly located - leaving very small space between the seat and the top edge of the bag - which leaves very little place to fit stuff in. Also the material is of very poor quality - it began to tear after a very short while although I'm very careful not to place anything heavy in it.This is no doubt one of the worst purchases I've done lately !!!Stay away from it !
5,Great stroller and easy to push,"I purchased this stroller about 4 months ago. One of my good friends up in Canada had one and she just loved it. So, we decided to purchase one as well. It is durable, light and easy to push. This stroller looks super and most importantly our son just loves riding in it.Living in Boston we needed a stroller that could handle the snowy winters. This stroller with the wide wheels and cover performed perfectly when pushing in the snow. My husband and I were confused about one part of the assembly and contacted tike tech for help. I am not sure what SBK is talking about, but I can say that tike tech's customer service is among the best we have ever received. They were responsive, knowledgeable and very polite. After we read SBK'S review we felt we needed to write a review of our own.We definitely would recommend this stroller to other parents."
3,Well-built but not so attractive stroller,"When I received this stroller I was extremely disappointed with the fabric(it is a strange color and also made with a very cheap looking nylon). I planned to immediately box it up and ship it back but as soon as I put my baby in it I changed my mind. He looked extemely happy and comfortable, and he always seems to fuss in his other stroller. I decided to keep the stroller and it has performed very well on the dirt trails around my house. I recommend this stroller to people who aren't so concerned with appearance and just want a well-built stroller for a reasonable price. Maybe try the red or maroon."
2,Totally disappointing,"Based on Arthur Baker's work with New Order, and the outstanding quality of the Interpol material, I had great hopes for this. The result is completely disappointing, however. The remix adds nothing whatever of any interest to the material."
4,Great Bag,"The bag was great, and accurate to what was represented online, which sometimes isn't the case. I love the color and the quality of the leather, and I appreciate the tips for care of it that was enclosed with it. The only problem I have at all is the cost of shipping. I was not prepared for that and believe that I chose the standard shipping time which should only have been $3 or so. Instead I was charged $9.50 which I feel was inordinate considering the bag itself was only $15.99."
1,Really? Save your money. Nothing great here.,"People really like this book? I was excited after reading the other reviews but the book is nonsense. You could never follow it in calendar format because the things it asks you to do are impossible. Like, on one day in the summer get black sand to test for magnetism. Like everyone has access to black sand? And a lot of days are just fillers like it tells you to look at the sky and see a jet fly over head. On another day look at a tree. On another day look at a cloud. Many of the days tell you to go get a book on something (like rain or thunder) and read it to your kid. You could come up with these ideas on your own."
3,Fun Book - But Laced with Evolution,"I gave this book 3 stars because while reading through it to prepare for my class, I found multiple references to evolution. One example would be the January 5th segment which states that we must dress for cold weather ""since we have lost much of the fur that once covered our bodies"". References like this and others (""millions of years to form"", and ""billions of years ago"") are laced throughout the book. These statements are added purposely, yet are unnecessary to the content. Everything is stated as FACT rather than THEORY, and it makes me wonder why the author went to such lengths to push the evolution agenda on such a young audience? It would have been much better if she would have stuck to the facts; facts about studying nature around us, rather than mixing fact with the theory of evolution. The problem I have is that all the comments have nothing to the content of this book. The activities are good, if you can sift through and skip all the evolution stuff."
4,GrownUpMusic.com Recommended!,"Cassandra Wilson is an original. After years of swinging with a trio, she switched gears and turned to a less traditional sound: lots of guitar and percussion. The result is an earthy fusion of jazz, folk, pop, blues and R&B.; When you hear the soul in this woman's husky voice and the way she wraps her style around a lyric, you'll understand why Time Magazine declared her ""America's Best Singer."" On this CD,Wilson applies her golden touch to Dylan's ""Lay Lady Lay,"" Sting's ""Fragile"" and even the untouchable ""Crazy."""
4,Cassandra I Finally Got It,"Cassandra Wilson is one of those artists whose style is understated almost to the point of laziness. It takes more than one listen to appreciate the vocal nunances that make her great but, I now dig what she's doing. I absolutely enjoyed Glamoured for the sheer vocal magic of Wilson's smokey vocals. She particularly shines on I Want More, Lay Lady Lay, If Loving You Is Wrong, Crazy, and Honey Bee. Cassandra has been doing her thing for some time ....I'm happy I finally caught up."
4,Another Winner,"This CD is very much along the same lines as New Moon Daughter, Belly of The Sun, Blue Light Til Dawn. Nice renditions of ""If Loving You Is Wrong"", ""Fragile"" and ""Crazy."" My favorite cuts are ""I Want More"" and ""What Is It?"" If you're a Cassandra fan, then I don't think this will disappoint as it doesn't break any new ground (for me). It's pretty standard and I like that!"
4,this is a mid-streamed CW album,"Being a Cassandra Wilson (CW) fan, ""Glamoured"" has feint sounds of the older CW, before the Blue note days. It sounds like to a prelude to the later Blue Note label,"" Belly of the Beast"" recording. Same tempo. ""Glamour"" has more of the themes of seeking a romance or finding the stability of love elusive. I would recommend Glamour to someone who may be looking to OWN a SECOND recording to ""sample"" the RANGE OF MS. WILSON. It is only similar to ""Blue Light Til Dawn!"" in that it has many acoustic instruments, but ""Blue Light..."" is more African sounding. Glamour is mostly mellow toned with hints of blues, Latin, jazz, and folk. I would not recommend listening to this CD as music ""to stay awake"" or work the night shift."
1,Put your iPod away with this one!,"I have asked, as I'm sure many others, that amazon just tell us in the product write-up if a CD is ""copy protected"" - i.e. cannot be added to a legitimate digital music collection. In the case of this CD I was deeply dissapointed to not be able to play it anywhere I use my iPod. As for Cassandra, yes characterful and typical - maybe a bit predictable and ""cookie cutter"" by now? I don't know - but she has sooo many similar sounding albums out now that I'm wondering if there's a big machine where you feed in tunes & it then ""Cassandrafies"" it automatically...."
1,No opinion,"I have not listened to this album but I have a stack of her previous offering for anyone who wants them. Since ""Blue Skies"", she has been making recordings that always seem to appeal to people who only listen to the music once and think, ""This must be a great artistic effort because it is so unlistenable."" I've bought several of those CD's and have finally decided there's no future in buying any more Cassandra Wilson albums. Her breathless, whiskey-tinged voice is attractive and seductive, I'll admit. Her photos make her look like a Victoria's Secret model. Her spell on the critics is interesting. But her recordings (since ""Blue Skies"") are not enjoyable experiences. But she has found her niche and we can look forward to more of this type of output in the future. As for me, I give up. No more."
5,SaltAire works pretty well,I have seasonal allergies and two good shots of SaltAire are very helpful every morning in the shower. I like this product a lot. It is a bit too expensive but worth it. Order in bulk to reduce the per unit cost.
4,Royal prose!,"A great primary resource, with writing that holds up today on both clarity and verve. I generally find this sort of writing a trial, but Caesar is direct, easy to understand and terse. And if I may digress into a somewhat obscure 'Seinfeld' reference, Caesar's reference to himself consistently in the first person recalls the character Jimmy -- ""Jimmy's gettin' angry"" and so forth."
3,Conquest of Gaul,"This translation chronicles Caesar's military adventures in Gaul (modern France), Germany and Britain. As in any autobiography, you have to keep a skeptical eye on the events related. All autobiographers try to justify their actions and paint themselves in noble colors.Caesar was not the historian (nor writer) that Tacitus was, but as a participant in these events, he provides invaluable on-the-ground observations. His book makes one thing clear. Ancient Gauls, Germans and Britons succumbed to splinters in their own tribal factions as much as to the might of Roman legions. Caesar spent as much time mollifying tribes and building alliances as he did conducting military campaigns.Caesar's prose is workmanlike, if not quite elegant. A longer introduction that included more general information about ancient Rome would have been helpful for the nonspecialist."
1,Worst Web-editing software available,"First of all, this product is unbelievably bloated, it takes literally minutes to come up. That wouldn't be so bad if it was a decent product, but it's quite the opposite. Numerous bugs, frequent crashes and non-intuite UI are enough to drive anyone insane. IF you for some reason decide to use this,there's one piece of advice for you: save your work every 2 minutes. I've lost work on numerous occasions when the application just crashes or freezes.The quality of this is below the of level of some free products that are available out there."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Software,"Adobe GoLive CS2 is easily the worst application I've used in years. I went through the Adobe GoLive ""Classroom In a Book"" and then proceeded to develop a very simple website. I quickly discovered that the book carefully avoids doing anything too complex, because the software simply can't handle it.This software crashes regularly. I quickly became trained to save the file after each operation. Other bugs include its inability to produce code that can be interpreted by either MS Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox. Pages will appear different in each browser. Java scripts might work in one or the other browser, seldom in both. Also, CSS text formatting tags (a:link, a:hover etc.) perform differently in each browser, the preview pane and the so-called Live Rendering screens.It is very clear that this software was not thoroughly tested before being released. Or, more likely, it was released to meet a delivery target rather than any established quality criteria."
3,3.5 - Satisfying mixtape,"In true Wu-tang supergroup fashion, the Weathermen are a nine man conglomerate. Vast Aire, Yak Ballz,(I think it is just Yak now) Copywrite, Cage, El-P, Jakki, Camu Tao, and Tame One tackle the twenty tracks of this mix CD. All emcees come correct and rhyme over some tight instrumentals like Nas' ""Made You Look"" and B.I.G.'s ""Dead Wrong"". There is enough original material on here too though. Many tracks are exclusives, and the lineup variations work well, I think. Each rapper has ample oppurtunity to shine and the result is one notable song after another. Jakki, Camu Tao and Yak are done justice in that they are not underappraised in favour of the more established rappers. Highlights are ""Concerto"" by Tame One, ""Beverly Hills Crabs"" by Cage and ""Volume"" by Yak. This mix defintely serves to heighten anticipation for The Weathermen's full-length. Not to mention that it is another solid album to be released by Eastern Conference Records."
4,"One of the best mixtapes to come out, ever","When i first heard this album i had to have it. Beats from songs that i normally would have hated, filled with lyrics from some of the best emcee's to come out of the early part of the 21st century. Each track is on point and on spot, the tape flows great and i've played it so many times i've had to buy it twice. If you are into underground hiphop, this is simply a must own. I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't a mixtape, because most of the songs on this are on other albums by the artists. This album features the late Camu Tao doing some of his finest work. It reminds me of when underground hiphop had a future, now it seems like all it has is a past."
4,Fascinating,"This was a glorious exploration of human relationships between young and old - really old! It was also very funny. The soundtrack was just a hoot and I adored that woman with the big blonde hair and the goblet of wine. Good for anybody interested in Texas, rich people, or family dynamics."
2,Gimme a break,"What a load of hooey all these reviews are! She's a spoiled, poor little rich girl out to do a hatchet job on her dad. And she can't even do that. the old guy outfoxes her. The only thing I liked was hearing about Tom's world. All that psychobabble therapy stuff is for the dogs."
4,Perfect for what I needed,"I bought this when I decided to go after my architectural engineering degree, thought it would be a good thing to also know a few things about interior design. This book did not fail me when I needed it and would totally recommend it!! Fast, and flawless shipping as always by amazon!!"
2,It is not what I expected,"I am going to build muy custom house and I want to do it according to the Feng Shui. I was expecting to find many Feng Shui floor plans samples...well let me tell you that not, it has not many Feng Shui floor plans, such a few, and most of them do not match what the book says. I mean that most of the foor plans are not according to Feng Shui bagua grid (occidental), i.e.: bathroom is Wealth area, when it is known in all schools that bathroom can't be placed there.I found just 1 floor plan, so it is not worthly to get this book if you are looking for Feng Shui floor plans."
4,Wonderful first novel,"I used to watch Dr. Smith all the time when I lived in NY so when I heard that he'd written a novel, I couldn't wait to pick it up. It's a great story and did not disappoint. Strong characters, interesting and unexpected locale and nothing seemed unlikely. I can't wait to see Sterling Bledsoe in another novel.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"
1,If you are an honest good decent kind person,"Do not support this author. Anyone who knows him or has worked with him knows he's only ""kind"" (if he is capable of it) to people who can help him, and bullies and manipulates any subordinates. If you are a kind, decent person, know that you should give your support to another more worthy author who is a decent human and who doesn't need to ask his friends and relatives to write his reviews on amazon."
4,He's here,"People talk about being raised as army brats. I was raised an academic brat. Later I became a mystery and thriller reader. For me, Ian Smith's debut novel featuring Sterling Bledsoe captured my past, my imagination and my thriller reading heart. As a first story this novel is engaging, keeps you turning pages and has a very unique plot line. As a thriller, this book is great for the following reasons; the plot isn't the predictable points a and b add up to point c. Smith throws curves at his reader,addresses the improbability of a brother investigating his brother's murder with an awe shucks, it could happen aplomb that is heartening in the same way the first Michael Connelly and Jack Reacher books were. Sterling Bledsoe is welcome as a new protagonist on my T.B.R. pile. I cannot wait to see where Smith goes from here."
5,incredible suspense,"I'm an avid reader of suspense, and Smith's book was outstanding. He had me hooked early; I could not put his book down. It was not the usual 'who done it' mystery. There is a fascinating story line. He is a new writer that will go a long way. I'm looking forward to his next book."
1,A Laughably Awful Piece of Crud,"If I ever doubted that Amazon reviews were bought and manipulated by the author or publisher I sure don't now. This book is so awful I could not stop laughing at the (unintentionally) ridiculous writing as I read it aloud to my wife on a long car trip. Every cliche and elementary writing blunder and embarrassment is exhibited on virtually every page. Read the credits and the jacket and you know why this book was published: connections, connections, PC mania and chutzpa. Certainly not anything to do with talent. It's beyond depressing to see publishing resources expended on this kind of puerile garbage when the country is full of superb writers gathering stacks of rejection slips from publishers hungry for nothing but pathetic trash like this that they think they can sell to gullible morons. Save your money."
2,What happened to SOME of the old reviews?,"About a month ago, I placed my comments on this site after reading this book. Needless to say, my review was not full of praise like some others, but it was clear that I had read the book and had some valid criticisms. However, a number of reviews following mine said I didn't know a great book when I read one and what did I know since I didn't write a book and even insulted me personally. Anyway, my review and a rebuttal (and others' references to it) have been removed. Do bad reviews get dropped after awhile to ""goose"" the overall ratings and boost sales? For the record, the story has potential, but it gets very predictable at times and it good be a lot better written.It would be very discouraging if honest reviews were regularly purged. Anyone know what gives??"
2,Nothing original here,"I really don't understand all the good reviews here. I thought this novel was poorly written, unimaginative, unoriginal, and cliched. If you want an honest review, check out the New York Times ""Books in Brief"" review. It was obvious in the first chapter who the diabolical mastermind was - so there never was much of a mystery. I also found a great deal of the book almost insulting in its implausibility. The only reason I finished the book at all was to be able to say with full knowledge, that it has no redeeming qualities. I gave it two stars instead of one only because, I'm sure worse books have been written - so I'm grading on a curve."
4,Recommended summer reading,"Wilson Bledsoe is a Dartmouth professor acclaimed the world over while sporting a Nobel Prize and most recently the $2 million dollar Devonshire prize for his work in the science field. His murder on the way home from a party celebrating his latest achievement is what sets up the action in this debut thriller. Wilson's brother, Sterling is conveniently an FBI agent who investigates the case. He discovers a problem with dead blackbirds in the area and tries to tie the murder of his brother to the presence of the birds. The connection may appear tenuous but when Sterling becomes a suspect in his brother's death, there is a much greater sense of urgency to solve the crime.Ian Smith, an NBC medical correspondent has written a competent debut mystery novel. Well plotted and paced with adequate characterizations, there is much here to entertain the masses at the beach or by the pool."
1,Made me want to stick a screwdriver in my ear!,"I have never reviewed a product before, this is horrible! It sounds like a few people got together in their basement with a guitar and Casio keyboard (complete with the auto-rhythm buttons) and started singing! It is beyond awful--from the singing voices to the cheesy arrangements and music to the selection of songs. This was my first venture into kids' music cd's (got it from the library), and while my 3 year old liked the songs he recognized, I think it is merely because he knew them from preschool. I immediately got online to research other cd's for him (found some that had people that could actually sing!), and this one went back to the library the next day, but not before I had to overcome the desire to pry out my own eardrums!"
2,Wrong Match,This was a poor quality product that did not fit our window mechanism. It is worth the time to seek out exactly how these work and if they will work for your specific window. None of the vendors were helpful with this information.
5,One of their best albums!,"This album is in my opinion one of the best albums they have made to date. It displays solid rock and roll with their twist of some blues and a good story. If you are looking for a good representation of their music, this albums is a great start."
1,you've got to be kidding me,"this album triggered my first review.after reading and hearing from countless sources (none of whom i truly trust) that this IS the new rock, i gave this a listen. sorrow reigns. i feel there is nothing remarkable about this album. all i hear is how 'stunningly original' they are, or how they are the 'saviors of rock-n-roll'. please. there is nothing here that hasn't been done before, and better. i sat myself through three listen-throughs and not a single song has stuck with me. not a one hit me with a 'wow, THIS is amazing' all hype.the ray of hope: if this turns people on to where the stripes'sound' came from, and they learn to trust onlywhat they hear themselves and not what otherstell them, then all is not lost."
1,I just don't get it,"Jack White cannot play guitar. He cannot sing. The drum lines are played similar to a child who has just learned 'rock beat one'. There is no bass whatsoever. However, these facts could be overlooked if the actual music showed some originality. but it does not. Four chord riffs, rock beat one, shaky vocal lines - Jack White has no songwriting talent whatsoever.I have no problem if you like this band, but they are NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, the brilliant band that so many people think they are. As a musician, I actually find this kind of stuff offensive to listen to."
1,A WASTE OF MONEY!!,"What a waste of money! All the songs are totaly lame and borring! Take my advice, you will just be really upset when you get the cd in your cd player, and start listening.. They should be called White Annoying Stripes......"
3,I know this may look like a bad review but...,"I know this may look like a bad review, but it isn't. Everyone on Amazon just goes to their favorite albums and gives them five stars and ruins the whole system for objective shoppers.White Stripes' White Blood Cells is ballsy, edgy, and spectacular... in places. If you start on track two you can count on every other song to rock your socks off, but the others well they are just mediocre. As far as garage bands go I think it's incredibly difficult for a band to record good fast songs, but mediocre slow songs should prove simple, like on this record. I think White Blood Cells is a magnificent accomplishment for rock n'roll. It has several mix CD worthy tracks (Hotel Yorba, I Think I Smell a Rat, Now Mary), but it lacks the good go-between songs that make a good album (like this one) great."
2,really all the rage?,"hey all,I first heard this record in a small shop across from my place and at first, my attention was held.Vocals reminded me of Black Francis from The Pixies, and the tone of each song kinda changed as quickly as a distortion pedal stomped upon. However, the drums are entirely too simple, which makes some of the songs lack imagination.""Little Room"" proves the musical impact the WhiteStripes vocals have, as all this song is comprised of is a backbeat and one helluva soul sounding vocal accompainment. Within ""Little Room"" is where I can see The WhiteStripes earning a following.Tracks like ""Fell In Love With A Girl"" may lack depth, but sometimes plain rockin' out is a welcome change from pretension.Overall, this record isn't bad to toss on now and again, but I don't really believe The WhiteStripes are all the rage, as many tend to portray them as."
3,Bit of a disappointment,"The first White Stripes album was a revelation of raw, bluesy power that blew me away. The second album, ""De Stjtil"", retained some of the same edge but also added a poppier and smoother element that, for my tastes, wasn't as engaging as their material on their debut. With their latest album they have, unfortunately, abandoned their blues influence all together and have shifted gears entirely to their pop inclinations. Some of this is still great, but the thrills are fewer and farther between than their two previous efforts. Some of this is even down right wimpy. For the uninitiated this is not the place to start - in fact I'd recommend this one last. Still better than most of the modern music out there, though."
4,Jack White is the dead leaves; I am the dirty ground.,"The first time I heard this album, I thought to myself ""What the hell...?"" But it did grow on me. It grew and it grew. It is like audio ivy. Some songs still haven't really grown on me, so that's why this only gets four stars. These songs include: ""I Think I Smell a Rat,"" ""Little Room,"" and ""Expecting."" My favorite song on this album would have to be ""This Protector"" because it's just so beautiful, and it has this unique sound not found anywhere else on this particular piece of work. Whatever it is, I like it. Some of my other favorites are ""Offend in Every Way"" and ""The Same Boy You've Always Known."" Oh, and ""I'm Finding it Harder to be a Gentleman."" So buy this, you weenie! And a copy of Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho!"
2,"Eh, well....","There's half a dozen decent songs on here, and the rest just grate on me. Pixies just did it a lot better. Sorry White Stripes."
5,It was Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground When this album was not around,"This CD is downright awesome! Every song is incredible (except ""Little Room"", which is crap).Even If you don't want to buy the whole album, at least download ""Fell in Love With a Girl"". White Stripes Rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Poor Quality, sound, and lack of a vital instrument","I own this record, and I must say that it is a very poor attempt at creating a solid record. I did not give it onw star because as structureless as the songs are, I feel that with some work, some talented musicians could get together and build decent music out of what these 2 folks have started--- but that's the thing. These songs are just started, hell i could easily write better compositons in my sleep. The lack of a bassist is probably the worst thing, I could hear 'Fell in love with a girl' sounding decent with a bassline. Dont get me wrong, I definitely dont have a problem with underproduced music, I am one of the biggest John Frusciante fans out there, and his solo work is wonderfully done, but music should be created by those who dedicate their lives to it, like John does."
2,Go to listen to the Pixies and TheBirthdayParty,Then you have some idea what this kind of music should be in the highest order. And you will know it is too far for the WhiteStripes to make it done. Uninteresting music is doomed.
2,all hype...,"okay...maybe two stars is a bit rough..but seriously folks..this album is not that good. okay, i'll admit that they do amazing things with just a guitar and some drums....but that doesnt make them as good as people make them out to be (they do have a great music video though)unfortunately, this is one of those CDs that gets old after listening to it only 3 times ...max (how complex can a song with only 2 instruments get?)i'll admit i did enjoy this album when i first got it, but now i hardly liten to it at all...kinda make me wish i spent those 15 bucks on a better album..... dont believe the hype!!!dont waste your money..just download the songs.."
4,White stripes good crazy,"I think Jack White is a young, arrogant genius who does art, not just rock. Kind of like Jim Morrison in those respects, I hope he does not drink like Jim. Also much more ironical. Great talent. Meg White is very proficient and my God, she's beautiful. Typical chauvinist, sorry."
2,This is a conspiracy!!,"There's no way these 2 pasty faced Detroit kids are playing just 2 instruments on this record and in concert!! Who exactly do they think they are, Local H?? I've seen 'em on Letterman live, and there's no doubt in my mind the song they played was pre-recorded. Only Jack Ryan's voice was authentic in that performance.Nonetheless, they can hammer their instruments like pros. Part Zeppelin, part Sabbath, part Silverchair, the supposed ""brother and sis""/""ex-husband and ex-wife"" White tandem can jam hard when the mood strikes. It's my theory that these 2 were just loafer friends who decided to put a metal band together. When they discovered they couldn't cut the metal scene, they decided to be ultra-ironic, ultra-alternative, and the results are mixed at best.Oh well, enjoy the farce that IS White Stripes."
1,Serious question,"OK, serious question here folks: is the critical and fan adulation for this band (and Jack White in particular) some kind of perverse in-joke by hipsters, kind of like the praise the French heap on Jerry Lewis? It certainly can't be from serious admiration of the musicianship, songwriting, or singing, all of which are on the same level as a couple of teens who have just started to learn to play their instruments fooling around in their parents' garage, or perhaps The Shaggs. I guess this is one of those phenomena like Captain Beefheart's ""Trout Mask Replica"", where people pretend to ""get"" it so they can think of themselves as cooler-than-thou, while all the time ignoring that the Emperor is buck naked."
1,Fake- Get the real deal,"This CD was OK but an obvious rip off of the flat duo jets. I recommend getting the real mcCoy. If you like this then Go buy Dexter Romweber`s latest CD, ""Chased By Martians"". He was the guitarist/singer from The Flat Duo Jets."
2,oooo my god,"This is absolute poo... They dont have a bassist, and only like two good songs. Are they not intelegent enough to write a good song... Fell in love with a girl needs bass, and so do all of thier horrible songs. I cant believe they actually put this record out... Buy a real cd like, the strokes or anything...Its all preety much better than this..."
3,white stripes,"this band is not better than KoRn, i have to say that KoRn is by far better, more talent,and jonathan davis has a way better voice, anyways, limp bizkit sold out, creed is christian rock im not into all that, im more into slipknot,KoRn,sevendust,and more heavier rock,"
4,This is a Frickin' Weird CD - Cool!,"I bought this album for ""Fell In Love With a Girl,"" and absolutely hated it the first time I listened to it all the way through - I've since changed my mind - it grew on me - I have no idea why - Jack White's voice can be a little annoying at times, but his playing is great and the song lyrics are too good to miss out on."
3,"good album, if you start here they only get better...","While there ARE some good tunes on here (especially the wonderful We're Going To Be Friends, Dead Leaves, and Gentleman) after hearing their other three records, something seems missing from this one. The album is competently played, but many of the tunes just don't grab me like on the other 3 albums. But don't take my word for it, listen yourself. It's still better than most rock albums that came out that year... If you can find it, the ""Redd blood cells"" version with bass sounds a lot fatter (see reddkross.com). Viva la White Stripes!"
4,(4 1/2 stars) Jack and Meg went up the hill,"This album is great, I would actually say it was the best of 2001 or at least in the top 3. But they're on MTV now, so watch out for the indie backlash because here it comes and its gonna get ugly."
5,instant classic,"This band actually deserves all the hype they've been getting. (Unlike the Strokes). Jack is a genuinely talented songwriter. (meg is his ex-wife) Surprisingly, has a lot of Led Zeppelin influence. A garage mix of Zep and the Pixies? I actually was living in Detroit as they were starting out, now i'm kicking myself for not finding out about them sooner. Everything I'd heard of the Detroit garage scene was pumped up..., but the White Stripes are a shining exception!"
3,"Room for improvement, but this rocks!","I have to agree with the reviewer who bemoans the poor drumming (and, to a lesser degree, the lack of bass). The drumming is not good. And I'm no musical snob.That said, the songs are solid, a beautiful melange of Zep, Pixies, Who -- this is real live rock all the way.I can't stop listening to this album, so never mind the picky complaints, and buy it already!"
5,Totally Rockin',"This Album is by far their best. With their newest release they have perfected their craft. Jack and Meg stop at no avail to rock you throughout this entire album. The White Stripes are one of the BEST bands today, I definetly suggest buying this album. And if you ever get the chance to see them play live do not hesitate, they are the Best live band I've seen to date and that's a lot coming from just two people."
5,REAL electric blues,"The White Stripes are the BEST and this album proves why. The minimalist aproach that the White Stripes take on this album highlights the blues -- the old fashioned Mississippi style and not the cotton candy version -- influences that have been at the heart of this incredible duo. Throw in some punk, hard rock, and unbelievable electric guitar playing (Jimi Hendrix-esque), and you have what I think is the best band out there.The reviewers who critcize this album (and Amazon for rating it so high) are way, way off base. Their criticisms usually involve cries of no bass, grungy production value (ever heard of Kurt Cobain or Beck???), alleged tin-ny sound (not true, but then have those critics ever heard Robert Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters, or Howlin' Wolf????), etc. Forget those losers and buy this great album!"
2,I'm starting to get confused,"I'm really starting to get confused here with the recent ""return of rock"" era which has brought so many out of country artists like the Hives, the Vines, the Strokes, the White Stripes, i mean what's the difference, they all sound and look the same so why buy their albums?The White Stripes might look and sound the same as others but at least two or three songs on the album are decent enoungh to hear. I fell in love with ""Fell In Love With A Girl"" the first time I heard it. ""We'll Just Be Friends"" is pretty good and some of the other songs are alright.So, in my perspective, all the groups like this can just forget about having careers that last more than 15 minutes."
2,another Blown Up Act,I first saw this Band on a Tv Show&was curious why all the Hype? I was like what is the Big Deal about them&The Strokes?? but I have to Remember how things go in circles.the playing is alright the only thing that kinda makes them ok at best.but as far as Arrangements&Structure? nope not here.I don't feel the Vocals at all.it's ok at best but forgettable in months as well.
3,"Serves Its Purpose well, but Nothing Special","The Hipster Detroit rock band turned Hit of the Moment band offer material that is time relevant but nothing special. There are a few singles on the album that are catch and worth listening to, and one line that is classic, ""What would I like to have been? Everything you hate!"" Aside from that most of the songs sound very similar. Jack White is clearly a talented musician, but Meg White is not and there are no other members of the band, so there many of the songs are very minimalistic and could benefit from the addition of a few layers (a bass for starters) If you haven't bought it by now, so sense in giving into the hype. Do yourself a favor and get The Strokes or The Vines is instead. It is much better music."
4,"Worst drumming ever, but a great record regardless","Meet the next Bob Dylan. As is well documented, Dylan is a great songwriter. And it takes people to cover his songs before you really see how great the songs are.I see the White Stripes going down almost the same road. This is a great album, but just because (1) the songs are extraordinary, (2) the singing is tremendous, and (3) great lyrics. It sure isn't the drumming, which I have determined HAS to be the WORST ever captured on a commercial record. And I'm sorry, but this arrangement without bass has gotta go (granted, I'm a bass player).So as wonderful as this disc is (and it's in my car's CD player now), I can't wait to start hearing the covers come out in 5 years. Then we'll find out how perfect it actually could have been."
5,sweet,"Why is everyone so mad they got so hyped up? They didn't ask to for all the hype. They got the hype because they played mtv and are selling like no other and they don't sound anything like most bands who play mtv and sell like no other. This is a damn sweet cd, but it's not for everyone. If you listen to Avril Lavigne, Matchbox 20, creed, or any kind or rap this is gonna go right over your head."
5,"I am not kidding you, these two are brother and sister and u","sed to be married to each other! I am not kidding you! I was at their wedding and it was one wild scene 'cause these two is the good looking ones! the rest of there families got mis shaped heads and big ugly moles and hunch backs and shriveled arms and I just hope these two DID NOT have any children 'cause if they did then chances are SLIM 2 NONE that those children are gonna look near as good as these two, cause these two got lucky!"
2,One good song does not a CD make,"If you project the quality of 'In Love w/ a Girl' to the rest of the album, then you've made the same mistake I have. That song is killer, but in no way represents the rest of the songs contained on the CD. You might find 1 or 2 other songs that are catchy tunes, but overall, unless you like really raw, amateurish performances devoid of any complexity, you'll be left disappointed."
2,Two stars for two songs!,The slow songs are dreadful and indulgent. I wish people knew about the Gun Club.
2,Needs a bass player,"As somewhat of an amateur bass player, I simply cannot condone any music that chooses to not have one. If I were to think of a classic artist - let's say Bread, for instance - not having a bass player, I would think that band's impact would be severely diminished. And don't go telling me the Beatles never had a bassist. His name was Paul McCartney.The songs are pretty good, though."
1,Easily the worst cd I have ever heard,"There is no redeeming musical value in this cd... I wish there was a negative star rating so it could be properly reviewed...This one was given to me as a gift. I should probably wonder if that person hates me. Easily the worst cd I have ever heard.Save your money, or shove it in your ears before you try to listen to this ..."
3,Not the Best... Not the worst,"There's a lot of better music out there, but theres much more bad music out there too. It took some time to get used too, but after a while I found the White Stripes more and more appealing.The best songs are I fell in love with a girl, Hotel Yorba, The Union is forever, and the best and just about the only humorous song... Little room. It's about getting a little room and doing something good, and then having to move to a bigger room and forgeting how to do the good thing that you moved to the bigger room in the first place for.If you've never heard the stripes, check them out, even if there are a few better bands out there..."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"Four words: don't believe the hype! Yes, ""White Blood Cells"" is unlike anything else out there, but it's not doing anything worth paying attention to. It's also not worthy of all the hype radio and magazines have placed upon it.It's easy -- impossible not to, really -- to fall in love with the sheer rawness and energy of the White Stripes' first single ""Fell In Love With a Girl."" I did and I bought the album, expecting at least a few more tracks like it. What a mistake ... there are exactly zero other tracks with the same screechin' guitars and raw noise. What's left is a whole lot of boring lyrics and odd vocals.I give the White Stripes two stars for potential. If Jack and Meg get a bassist and some decent melodies, they would be well on their way to stardom. I guarantee it. In the meantime ... wait."
3,A work in progress,"I really wanted to love this record. It's got a hard punkish edge, some nice country twang, some nice concise songwriting and good vocals; sounds like the White Stripes have an equal love of Neil Young, classic rock and rockabilly influenced punk a la X. A few songs even branch out and get a little experimental with some thick organ and creepy vocal samples.It's not a bad disc but I can't get over the lo-fi sound. The production is really bare-bones and somewhat tinny; without a bassist the Stripes come off a little shrill. Some of the songs also sound sort of tossed off, like they'd make a fantastic collection of 4-track recordings but not quite up to the level they're capable of. I like the record, but listening to it I can't help but think that when the White Stripes get a bassist and a recording budget and trim the fat (there is a lot of ""filler"" here), they'll be a lean, mean little rock band.Worth a listen but keep your expectations in check."
2,"It's just OK...not like the ""saviors of rock"" or anything...","Boy, this prolific MemphisBowlerPimp guy must mistakenly think he's really funny and oh-so-clever. Another rebel without a clue.Anyway, the White Stripes are raw, unadorned, bluesy fare that is enormously derivative and will hardly light your world on fire, but fine if you like that sort of thing. I prefer a little more skill and a little less amateurish rough edges...err, excuse me, I mean ""honesty."" That's what all the critics say, don't they? This band plays breathtakingly ""honest"" music. Well, it's not really all that good or life-changing or rock-genre-saving. Honest!"
4,Jacks Back,"While I have to say I like this album, I re...a...ly like this album. Over some of the other white stripes albums. I don't know what it is - whether it's the HIT songs on it, but it just seemed to be an alround good album.If you like that two piece sound (no grunting bass or rhythm guitars), this is probably the pick of the bunch for me."
4,Not their best..,"I must say the White Stripes are one of the best bands out there, however; this is NOT their best cd. Personally I prefer De Stijl to White Blood Cells. White Blood Cells is a great raw sounding cd with little polish and it does return to basic garage rock. Don't get me wrong, I really like this cd, but it's not the follow up to De Stijl I was looking for. I would recommend De Stijl to start out with though since it has catchier songs and is all around a better cd."
3,3 stars for what i heard so far (don't have CD yet),"i agree with the previous reviewer who said to buy ""raw power"" instead if you really want this kind of garage sound. i'm sure plenty of kids into this never heard of the stooges' classic.i like the white stripes though even though they are pretty derivative. sure there's no comparing ""search and destroy"" to ""fell in love with a girl"", but then again the 'stripes are only TWO people making a big stoogey noise. while you shouldn't over rate them, no need to slag them either."
3,Not that brilliant,"Many of the previous reviews say that this guys voice sounds like Frank Black's and the band sounds like the Pixies? Well sorry, but I just don't see it. Maybe he wishes he could sound like Frank Black but he doesn't.I didn't think this album was particularly great, but tracks like ""Hotel Yorba"" and ""Fell in love with a girl"" (which is why I bought it) standout. Anyway, if you're hoping for the Pixies don't buy it but if you want an average album from a band that could be great but aren't yet then buy it."
2,"Yay, we're indie pop stars!","Yeah, it's all trendy and great, isn't it? If you gotta be the coolest kid in vintage clothes on the block, then this is the album for YOU!Jack and Meg make bass-less, message-less, and spirit-less loud garage rock. Saviors of rock and roll, I think not.""Fell In Love With A Girl"" gets stuck in your head, and that's not necessarily a good thing. Singing along makes you sound like an epileptic at a discoteque.""The Union Forever"" and ""Hotel Yorba"" save this from utter uselessness."
3,Hipster americana,"3 1/2A sturdy if trailed off attack of scuzzy melody thrives off the less-is-more approach, guided by White's superb ear for productive rawness, capable of elevating even his simplest of songwriting exercises into genuinely effective indie-blues-rock excursions."
1,This is nothing special,"90% of the public has the ability to make this music. There is nothing new here. No profound lyrics, not catchy melody, no musicianship. This is one of the worst bands I have ever heard."
4,"Pixies circa ""Doolittle"" era if they had been a two-piece","... with Kim Deal on drums. ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground"" is the best song that the Pixies never recorded. Jack White one-ups Black Francis, in that he can sing in similarly affected style without seeming insincere. The lyrics range from playful to romantic to ominous, sometimes in the same song. The music is as stripped down as one would expect from a two-piece unit, but the Whites shake things up enough to sustain interest.Not a great album, as others have said, but definitely necessary in these overproduced and image-conscious times. A downright must-have if ""Monkey Gone to Heaven"" and ""Number 13 Baby"" are still in heavy rotation on your jukebox."
4,3rd Album is a gem.,"After two great records, this coulda been White Stripes' major label debut. Instead, Jack and his sister stayed with ""the one that brung 'em"" and turned out this beaute. Some might complain that the Stripes have smoothed out the edges a tad, but that's just knitpicking. The passion is still the same, the tunes have hooks like Mike Tyson, and your feet can't fight the feeling.""Hotel Yorba"" is classic, just add time."
2,Not that great,"I love all kinds of music, and this is an okay album, but there are and have been much better garage rock bands. Most of them never make the national scene. The White Stripes seem to have caught because of their personal style (I dig the whole red and white thing too), but it's not as great as the hype would have you believe."
5,Finally a band willing to do something fresh,"White Blood Cells gets back to basics. It sounds like it was heavly influenced by the 60s and 70s greats. Beatles, Stones, Zepplin, it's all in there. Every song has its own flare and it never has the all to common problem of one song blending in with the next. I can't wait to see these guys live!"
5,what the hey,"As a baby boomer growing up with all the 60's and 70's legends, I figured after early retirement I'd get back into music and search for bands that are still rocking. After buying and listening to a bunch of cds recommended by Amazon I have to say this is one of my favorites. It has components of classic rock with their own unique and excellent style. It's good sober or with a pretty good buzz, which is a true compliment. Rock on Stripes."
5,One of the greater cd's of today,The White Stripes are the definition of Rock n' Roll. I think that the majority of the people who do not like them are people who have been exposed to the music of today for too long. They don't know what a good song is supposed to sound like so a bad song to them is a good song to anybody who respects good music. IMO they are a mix of Led Zeppelin and The Carpenters. The Carpenters because they are brother and sister and Led Zeppelin because they rock and this cd shows it.
3,I prefer Elephant,"I got hooked on to The White Stripes after listening to Elephant which in my opinion is one of the best albums I own.I must admit White Blood Cells hasn't measured up to my expectations....I'd give it 3 and a half stars for great songs like Dead Leaves,fell In Love With a Girl,Same Boy You've Always Known,Hotel Yorba and the 50 second track ""Little Room""."
2,"""I think I smell a Rat""","This attempt at presenting us with the anti Britney/Nsync, only gives us another indication as to why the music industry is suffering. My wife bought me this CD knowing I'm into pop rock groups like Supergrass and early Kinks. The Hit: ""Fell in love with a girl"" reminded her of these Brit groups, with it's straight ahead rock/raw sound. This tune is pretty cool & catchy, But a complete album (16 tracks) built around 1 single tune that's only 2 minutes long???? (40 minutes total). Unfortunatley The rest of the album left lot to be desired. The CD is not bad, in fact overall I'd say its OK, but I can't listen to it front-to-back.After several listenings there is a sameness, in a bad way, that gets old really quick. I know that it's the toned down rawness that's ""cool"" about the White Stripes, but here it tends to sound almost contrived and ""gimmicky""."
3,"OK, it's rock.","I've listened to this album 5 times now. It is OK. If I really liked it, some of the songs (other than the tracks I liked immediately) would have grown on me. But I feel the same way about it now as I did the first time I listened to it. That having been said, some of the tracks are downright catchy. ""Dead Leaves..."" instantly adheres itself to your ears and gets your fists-a-pumpin. But overall tracks like this are sparce. As a whole this album seems very ordinary to me. I say this not having been exposed to much hype. I don't follow the scene propaganda. I prefer to just listen to the music and let it do the talking. This music is alright, nothing more or less. BUT in this album I can hear the potential for the White Stripes to produce some incredible rock. I look forward to checking out their other releases"
2,Overhyped trash,"Anyone who thinks this is honestly good music must be in denial.The critics and music elitists have been desperately grasping for straws in this stale era of music and have finally found something they can hold on too, Mod rock, neo rock, garage revival, whatever you want to call it. But they are kidding themselves. The white stripes are simply a bland tribute to the velvets and ramones with a twist of ""blues"". They are not accomplished musicians, they dont even have a bass player. They sound like they wrote this album in 15 minutes after listening to a kinks or stones album. Please i urge you not to give in to the false hype and instead listen to good indie bands like pavement or jon spencer."
1,I did not like this at all,"I tried to believe the hype -- I read all the rave reviews, I listened to the reviewers' favorite songs (and some others). But after all that, I still could not get into this album. It just bored me -- it evoked no emotion or rhythm in me."
1,This CD's fame shows how bad everything else is,"This is a very modestly interesting album, with a few ideas, not very well performed. In a golden era of music it would barely rate as a footnote. Since we are currently in such a bleak period of music, any little blade of grass that pokes up through the slag heap is greeted with tremendous acclaim, just for being a little blade of grass. I do not hear much genuine talent here, or potential for making future good music. This album seems to mean a lot to some people, and I am glad for them, but I think that this emperor has no clothes. The music, the lyrics, the singing, the playing, are all mediocre at best."
1,Deceptive: that's all I can say,"This one is a blatantly deceptive CD. I don't see where their 'originality' comes from (recycled post-punk?), but it seems that they are -like Andrew WK- the new so-called 'saviours of rock' (whatever. This means that they 'made it' in the business: everyone, starting from MTV loves them). If you ask me, the only thing I would love from 'The White Stripes' is the drummer, and not because of her drum playing. Sincerely, this is music destined to two kinds of people: A) boyfriends whose girlfriends love Britney Spears; B) 10 to 25 years old pink ""Powerpuff Grrrrls"" (see Kelly Osbourne). So, if you are INTO music, don't waste your time on this. En fin, I gave this CD one star because amazon.com doesn't let me rate it 0."
2,too much hype,"this is the album that got the buzz going amongst the college rock crowd, but if you're a fan of stripped down rock n roll, which their first album is all the way, then this is too progessive sounding. hotel yorba and fell in love... are great songs, but the others just don't have what their first album and parts of their second have, garagey, bluesy detroit wail. if you like overproduced stuff like the strokes or the shins (wimpy stuff), then this is for you. overrated"
1,I wouldn't buy it,"Okay, this is weird-I just listened to a few samples-and this CD is one that I would DEFENITELY not buy! This guy's voice is whiney and it sounds like country music. Yuck!"
5,one of my favorite albums!,"This album is...uh, really good. What a wonderful relief to hear Stooges/Dylan/Beatles/Zeppelin all mixed up in one rock and roll stew. I love evry track on this album, especially ""Offend in Every Way"", a raw, driving track laced with piano. Intelligent listeners will also be amused by the Citizen Kane homage ""The Union Forever"" (young Kane's yell while playing in the snow in the beginning)."
3,Uneven,"If all the songs were like 'dead leaves and the dirty ground', this would be a great album. There's a couple of tracks that are brilliant, and a couple of others that will drive you MAD. Good for a two man combo though.Didn't anyone else get the HUGE Led Zeppelin influence here?"
2,Kid's Dictionary,"The contents of the book are fine but it arrived with dirty pages and, a tacky sticker on the front of the book denoting the ""bargain price."""
1,Very poor writing,"I picked up this book based on the summary, which seemed quite interesting. I was saddened to discover, however, that the writing is extremely poor. If you pick up this book hoping to have the author depict an interesting and nuanced SF world to you, you'll be disappointed: every description is bare-bones, more like a movie script than a book (of the kind 'He said this, she said that, he nodded, he walked home.')I would definitely have passed this one had I known this before."
4,"Post-nanotech vision of future, thoughtful but not perfect","An interesting post-nanotech vision of the future. Some unique ideas here, but I found the nanotech war part a little unfocused, and the character development not ideal. I found the sequel a bit better. However, a good thoughtful hard sf read."
3,I think we're being watched (3.5 stars),"I don't think this book was horrible. I liked the technology a lot, and I especially liked the suspense of not knowing who the good guys really are. Who is telling the truth? Good suspense and interesting technology, mixed with a variety of characters told through a story in three different time frames. Result: some interesting characters, fun adventure, and some really uninteresting characters. What I found least enjoyable about this novel was the cheesy dialog. I realize Science Fiction is notoriously weak in the area of characters and dialog, but this was pretty bad for the most part. I hope Tony made enough money on this one to hire an editor for the next book in this series, there are some seriously bad mistakes about 75% into the book spanning roughly two chapters that could have been fixed with a quick read. Not a must read, but not a bad read either."
2,not a good effort,"An absolutely mediocre science-fiction novel, unremarkable in every way. I rarely abandon a book halfway through, but could not force myself to continue. We've got wooden characters, fanboy regurgitations of themes like nanotech that were cutting-edge 15 years ago, and bad writing. No thanks."
1,Bad...Just Bad,"I should have stopped reading after the first page, when I encountered this: ""Suddenly the cozy white leather and polished yellow wood lounge of his spaceship was not the safe cocoon he had grown used to over the past few months. Now they would be coming to prize him from this warm, cushioned shell to cast him shivering into the real world, all because he had made one tiny mistake.""No, the above is not a typo -- it actually reads ""coming to prize him"". And the writing doesn't get any better from there on out. This cringe-inducing prose could perhaps be overlooked if the book offered up new ideas, or even fresh (or at least exciting) takes on old ideas, but it does neither, instead spending 400+ pages recycling time-worn SF cliches about self-replicating machines, rogue AI, and humankind (of course) being a little too smart for its own good.This is the sort of work that gives Science Fiction a bad name."
2,Potential without follow-through,"Ballantyne took some basic ideas that have been explored before, and twisted them together in an interesting way. Unfortunately, he let the interlinked threads of the story control the presentation, and didn't invest enough in the characters or in freshening the basic ideas. While this was promising, it's not enough to make me pick up his next book."
2,Didn't love it,"I bought this game for my 3 and 5 year old sons based on good reviews. Maybe they will like it when they are older, but right now it's a bit too complicated to play on their own. Even playing it with adults, they lose interest quickly and would rather play with all the loose parts than play a real game by the rules. There are a lot of little parts to lose and the magnets pieces have come off of the letters. I also bought them hullabaloo and they love that game. It's easy, fun, active, and they can play it on their own with no little pieces to lose."
2,Cranium Balloon Lagoon,When I first purchased this product I was pleased. My grandson had received it as a gift for one of his birthdays and the children and I enjoyed playing it. That is why I wanted one for my home.We have only played it about 4 times and the musical timer broke; the game board does not stay together very well (unless you have it on a smooth surface - not carpeting); and the stickers come off the game pieces. The box is not sturdy enough nor does it pack away well. I paid too much for it and could not even find a contact address to write the manufacturer about the timer. The children ask about it but I tell them it is broken. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! It is a shame company's do not take pride in their products to make them durable. It was not man-handled by any means.
5,Great game!,Super fun game. The frogs are a little hard to get in but overall it's a great cranium game! My kids still love it and are 8 and almost 7.
3,"Entertaining Game, but needs some improvements","my 6 year old really loves this game. You spin the wheel in the center and pick 1 of 4 events. Depending on how you do at the event you get 0 to 4 balloons to put into your mover, when you fill up your mover, you win. The frog flip is good, the dice matching is good, but the make a word with the magnetic fishing pole simply doesnt work, no matter what you do with the fish pond, so you wind up taking the tile out and just leaving them on the board. but overall one of the better games out there for a 4-7 year old range"
5,Of Love & Hope,"With this year's release of season 1 and 2 of Beauty and the Beast, I was able to enjoy a favorite program once again. Then when I learned that the music was available through Amazon.com, I ordered the cd. The instrumentals, as well as the readings of Ron Perlman capture the imagination and the escapism of the love of not just Catherine and Vincent, but of the ideal concept of love and hope for all of us. The classic literature and music that brought the show to life now travels with me. I highly recommend this to fans of the show , fans of Ron and fans of the classics. Thanks for making it available to us."
5,He's the best!,"Ron Perlman has such a wonderful calming voice. I love to listen to it and this CD is great. When I take my ""me"" time from the kids and other duties...lol, I put my head phones on and turn the CD on and drift away. I love this time just to listen to all the beautiful poetry and soothing music. It really is a great CD. It was delivered in the time promised and in brand new condition as stated. Overall I'm very satisfied with the product and service. 5 stars!!!!"
5,beauty and the beast cd,"very beautiful music, a great moment of pleasure has to listen to speak Vincent ,thank you."
5,The Voice of Wisdom,"Beauty & the BeastI absolutely love the series. Vincent is a man among men. The series mixes classic literature, classical music, poetry of language, love, and ageless themes. The musical themes from the series are mixed with readings of classical poetry read by none other than Ron Perlman as Vincent.The beautiful music is enhanced by the wonderful poems: a true delight for anyone who loves the series."
5,The most romantic cd you will ever own,"This album is not too well known and hard to find anywhere, but if there is one essential album for anyone who loves romance, this is it. Sonnets 29 and 116 by Shakespeare are just the beginning of the passion and romance you will experience. The music is breathtaking, equisitely scored, and evokes the best of this classic and beloved tv series. I am a professional and well published poet and I say that as one who knows poetry, the classic poems as read by Ron Perlman are the finest examples of the English language known to mankind! They evoke all the emotions of the human heart with spine-chilling beauty. If only a suitor would write or even recite stuff this good to me! You cannot help but to fall in love once you listen to this album."
5,Beautiful,"I loved this show and was upset when it went off the air. What a treat to watch my favorite show of years ago without commercials and time restraints. Now I remember why it was so special. It's romantic, action packed, and always a good message."
5,Beauty and the Beast TV Soundtrack,"I had the soundtrack from the TV show in LP form and was thrilled to see that you had it on CD. The quality of the sound was fabulous. Ron Pearlman (beast) was even more amazing in his reading of poetry on the CD. It was spellbinding. You could close your eyes and and be transported to below the city as Catherine was and feel you were there in person listening to Vincent. I had fogotten how beautiful the soundtrack and readings were until I listened to the CD for the first time in at least 12 years. Thank you so much!!!! I will be ordering the DVD's from the 3 seasons. Also may I say I have always been impressed with Amazon's quality of products, merchants and customer service. Sincerely, Bernadette L."
5,Like visiting an old friend...,"It makes me so happy to read all these reviews and know how this magnificent, timeless, wonderful work has positively affected so many people. How could it not...it is so personal, so touching, and so healing in every way...nothing but a total class act. I too have a ""worn out"" cassette (I actually wore two of them out) and so I am happy to find the CD version. I did pay quite a bit more once to someone on eBay, too...that's how much I have loved this since the late 80's. I am also thrilled that FINALLY the entire series, the only one of its kind, has been released on DVD...I know a lot of people begged, pleaded and signed a lot of petitions. They heard us!! I live in California, and when I visit family in New York...I always expect to see Vincent riding on top of the subway on his way to rescue Catherine in yet another situation...Peace, Love and Music to all! And Vincent for President!"
3,Of Love and Hope: Music and Poetry from Beauty and the Beast,The CD is changed from the cassette. They left out several of my favorite moments that were on the cassette. I didn't enjoy this version as much.
3,The poetry is great but kind of hard to hear,The reason I bought this CD was to hear Ron Perlman's unique voice reciting great poetry. For me the BatB soundtrack music was secondary. So I was disappointed that Ron's voice is at such a low volume that it is really hard to hear the poetry. The poetry selections and Ron's delivery are great. The music is a solid B.
5,Blast! Re-release ruined the value of this CD.,"If in the future you find yourself with a valuable CD, sell it before the re-release comes out. Oh well."
4,Beauty and the Beast of Love and Hope - CD,"I was a huge fan of the t.v. show, and absolutely loved the poetry that was read on the show. When I saw this cd had become available, I was delighted! The poems are all there, read in the melodic and flowing voice of Vincent, along with some of the music. The only ""flaw"" I find is that there just isn't enough of the beautiful music that was on the show. Can't wait to receive the DVDs."
5,Finally!!,"Finally, a new release of my favourite CD! (looks like somebody among TPTB has seen the light...)Now the show on DVD please!"
5,Excellent CD,"I really liked the TV series, so I bought the CD to listen to the songs and the poems.I recommend this CD to everyone who stills believes in romance."
3,Of Love and Hope,"Although this is a beautiful and soul soothing cd, the effect is somewhat spoiled by the fact that the music is far too loud in comparison to Vincents poetry readings. Separately, they are both beautiful, but with this recording you have to constantly turn the volume up for the poetry and down for the music. Thats a shame because it truly is beautiful otherwise."
5,Beauty & the Beast,"This is the best CD I have purchased. The music and poetry that I remember from Beauty and the Beast is the best ever. I am listening to it over and over. Thank yo. And the DVD I purchased Beauty & the Beast 1st Season, is just terrific, I have listened already to every episode. Cannot wait until Season 2 and Season 3 comes out on DVD. Please notify me when they do.Thank you.Dorothy Goldstein[...]"
5,The Wrestling God and The Greatest phisical athlete on SmackDown,"I Dont Care if you like him or not JBL is a great wrestler.Above the picture does not show his hat or belt which come with these guys. A great toy thats very realistic, his hair rubs off on the hat but only the inside. I can't stand all the elbow pads on every wrestler. This is one of the only new toys with the wwe championship. I hate rap I hate john cena but jbl is the one who gained my respect, heck even vince has my respect but cena can rhyme, who cares. One last thing is above youl see you can buy the whole cabnit."
1,Too fast...No guidance,"I was a practitioner of yoga many years ago in my 20's and 30's. At 52 I decided to start practicing again. I purchased the Yoga Zone beginners set with four videos and love it. However, they are all 55 minute sessions. There are times when a short session would be advantageous, so I purchased this video. It is an enormous disappointment. There are virtually no instructions, and when there are, by the time you figure out what is being asked, she is on to the next pose. I wind up feeling stressed and out of synch. Pass on this one, and go straight to the Yoga Zone. I'm still looking for a shorter but good yoga tape."
2,Rocket Speed Yoga,"I was originally only purchasing a YogaKids tape when I saw this ""Gentle Yoga"" tape. So without any research, I purchased this tape. Instead of being a relaxing 30 minutes, the host rushes the viewer from pose to pose and all the while she constantly says breath in and breath out- she also doesn't say whether you should be breathing through the nose or mouth.Finally, the picture quality of the tape was grainy. Save your money or at least find another tape."
4,Living Yoga's Gentle Yoga for Beginners,Overall a good video. I liked her Yoga for Weight Loss Conditioning video a little better.
2,Way too Fast For Beginners . . .,"I thought this would be an ideal beginner's tape, but it is way too fast for me. Suzanne Deason rushes from one pose to the next with almost no instruction on proper alignment. It is as though she took a 1-hour session and tried to squeeze it into a half hour. (I noticed that reviewers of her ""Yoga for Stress Reduction"" had a similar critisism.) I found myself getting frustrated and angry - exactly the opposite of how I'm suppose to feel after a yoga session. I prefer Kathy Smith's New Yoga Basics - the pace is slower, and the instruction more thorough."
2,Too fast for first timer,"It's a good thing I started with Sara Ivanhoe's ""Basic Yoga for Dummies"" tape first before this one, otherwise, I would have been really discouraged from going on. Although the ""Gentle Yoga"" tape was supposed to offer modifications, it really didn't - Ivanhoe's tape did. And Deason's tape was too fast! One pose after another without explanations, warnings or suggestions. I felt like I was playing catch up during the whole tape, which is NOT conducive to relaxation."
5,"This is Gentle Yoga, but not for beginners.","I loved this video. But, I must say if you have never done Yoga before anywhere you would have to watch this video maybe 2-3 times before trying it. Without any previous Yoga experience this would seem like the wrong video. But, once you are accustomed to it I think it is a great video."
1,Definitely NOT for Beginners,"I have purchased other videos from this company and been extremely pleased with them. That's why I decided to buy this tape for my sister when she inquired about video recommendations to start a yoga practice. Fortunately I tried it out before sending it on to her. I never did. It is definitely not for beginners. I have had a regular yoga practice for three years and it was too much for me. I found the verbal cuing impossible to follow. And it is highly undesireable, if not impossible, to have to constantly look up at the tv screen while trying to do yoga."
5,Amazon was quick,This was my first purchase through Amazon and I will continue to use them. It was quick and easy and I received my purchase very quickly.
3,Unexpectedly Bland,"Thought this album would rock more than it did. It was way more twangy country than I thought it would be, and I only ended up liking a couple of the songs. Thunderhead Hawkinds (track 2)is cool and blue-sy and the hidden track rocks. Drift away is an awesome song and shows off Kracker's incredible voice. However, I don't think he makes it his own, so you might as well listen to the original."
2,Stop making music you piggy-backing tonedeaf wonder,"Listen to this CD, then listen to anything off ""Double-Wide"". Notice anything new? Didn't think so.Yes, the Unc has a good sense of tone and his rhythms evoke the roots of folk, country and R&B; simultaneously, for which something must be said. That something comprise my two stars.In fact, he'd be wonderful if he'd just stop singing.Indeed, he gets no reward for badgering my aural nerves with ""Memphis Soul Song."" This annoying detritus is a lot like the movie adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel ""Beloved"" in that there are so many places it could, and should, end. But NO, it drags on... and on... and ON!And please, enough with the ""Sophisticated Country Boy"" routine. Kid Rock tried that, had his moments, and now where is the Kid? He's making the cover of the Onion. That's not necessarily a good career move."
1,Another ...cashing in on Kid Rock,"Another awful outing by someone who doesn't deserve any of the radio play he gets. You'd think someone who backs up Kid Rock would put out something cool and upbeat to listen to. Instead, some wonderful songs to fall asleep to. Listening to the yawner, drift away, sure isn't gonna make me wanna buy this junk. One thing, though, this is a half star better than his last album."
4,Drifting Away,"Like most people here, I got this CD for Drift Away, which is a fantastic cover. The other songs on here aren't bad, either. Uncle Kracker is a much better singer than one would expect from his Kid Rock roots. i even ike his rap/rock combo style. That's a big compliment considering I am not a fan of most rap music. The only draeback is the hidden track. It was vulgar apparently just for the sake of being vulgar. It kept this thing from geting five stars. I don't see wh Uncle Kracker feels the need to put such tracks on his CDs to earn his stripes. His vocal talents are more than enough to sell CDs without a parental advisory sticker to attract attention."
4,All around good cd,"I only got this cd because of Drift Away, but ended up generally enjoying this entire album. Kracker's rap songs are all right, but its better when he combines both rapping and singing, such as in No Stranger to Shame (track). The ""hidden"" track was pretty stupid. Seems like he only did this to attract those who wouldn't buy it unless is had a perental advisory warning. I don't mind dirty cds but why take a clean album and turn it dirty just for one stupid track."
5,Great cd,"Bought this mainly for the song ""Drift Away"". It's one of my favorite songs. I do like Uncle Kracker a lot, though. Was happy with the purchase."
1,Only one good song...,"There is only one good song on the C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money."
1,Rise???? Please FALL!!!!!,"Hmmm.. Just what the music world needed... More pointless music.. Well, I guess this could be classified as ""nu-rap-metal-hip-hop-crap""... Yep, that'll work.... I can't really say much about this album... Mostly due to the fact that it's lacking everything that a truly good stand-out album has... Such as meaning, and well... In this case, that's enough... It's just another basic simple floor plan... Goofy little white boy rapping his heart out to display all of that ""mad"" skill that he has with his merry band of followers.... I just wasn't impressed.. In this tyrpical genre, you better be good.. Other wise, MTV WILL BE calling you...."
5,One Word Description...... AWESOME!,"With a mixture of Zack de la Rocha's sound from Rage Against the Machine and an incredible singing ability, this band from Tallahassee, Florida knows how to rock the stage. I had never heard of this band until last night when they were at a concert in Knoxville, TN with DoubleDrive and Ra and they absolutly stole the show!!! This band really knows how to rock the stage! They got the crowd more involved than any band i've seen before. After the show i got to talk to the lead singer and drummer for a while and the guys are just really down to earth. If there was one cd i could recommend for someone to buy out of the 200 cd collection i have it would be Presence's ""Rise"" because of it's awesome style, the band member's incredible talent,and their ability to leave you singing their lyrics for hours and hours. Buy the cd NOW!"
1,Is it still 1998?!?!,Should have called it Rap Rock still Sucks. Give me a break...this is Boyband stuff meets pop rock-metal...blah blah blah
2,"It's okay, but...","Way too serious for a Christmas CD from one of the top bubblegum/pop bands from the seventies. Yes, I'm a fan (even picked up the recent box set which is a wonderful deal) but I was turned off by the heavy-handed production by Michael Omartian who's done much better with other projects. How about slipping in two or three upbeat Christmas numbers to balance out the somber tone? A few of the tracks click with ""The Spirit of Christmas"" easily being the best. I have to say that the ladies of Dawn shine bright on this disc but Tony disappoints."
5,Doom IS Masterful,"Such creativity, craftiness is incorporated in Dooms product and what I like best is that he knows how to spit the illest flow about the most undesirable or derogatory situations without making them too graphic often in lyrics that have to be decoded, so they make you think. This is unfounded in most all commercial hip hop and rarely found on da underground scene, but Doom is definately the wordsmith who consistently challenges our brains and thought processes. Unfortunately, this joint was lifted from me so I will have to cop another before they are no longer available. It is definately an underground ""classic""."
3,NOT ENOUGH GEEDORAH,"I had to re-review this album. I've been playing it as much as any other DOOM album and it's sounding better all the time. 4 stars. In todays world of gangsters/CEO/corporate pitchmen/actor/pimps stepping up to the microphone all in the noble pursuit of keeping it real, it's refreshing to have an MC take on the moniker of a three-headed space monster. Having said that the only thing that dissapoints here is the fact that we don't hear Geedorah enough. As in the Godzilla movies it seems you just don't get enough of the monster scenes. The comical cut-out army and King Geedorah figures on the inside sleeve may be worthy of the price of the album alone."
4,Only 1 flaw...,Too many wack guest artists... If Doom.. er.. um.. Geedorah flew solo on this disc it would have been a 5. A keeper none the less. Peep it and absorb it.
1,Se fue Van Van: Van Van's Lamest Hits,"This album is absolutely horrible! I am a fan of Los Van Van and Juan Formell, they are Cuba's foremost band. However, this cd is so bad that I cant believe it is by the same band that did the glorious ""Te Pone La Cabeza Mala"" album. The sound quality is awful. The songs are repetitive and tacky, completely different from the style of Los Van Van. In fact the album says ""Orquesta Los Van Van"" and not ""Los Van Van"" I wonder if it is not a different band. This album is an insult. Dont Buy! I would return it if I could, total waste of money."
1,Very Disappointing!,They send you 3 boxes of the 64 piece set. You do not get additional colors by ordering the larger set. There is very little thread on cardboard spools. Do not waste your money!
2,You get what you pay for,It was not what I was expecting. The thread is on cardboard spools and metal bobbins. It does not look like there is much there either. I should have read between the lines and what should I expect for the cost.
1,And he's my favorite author,"Occationally publishers come to an author and say, ""You are popular now and we have to get some more material into the market. You know all those articles you wrote and forwards and all, we will just compile them into a collection and call it a book. It really doesn't need a coherant theme."" Well my favorite author got talked into doing this with ""A Devil's Chaplain"". I can only hope he will hang his head in shame and pop that idiot publisher in the kisser. Not close to his best work."
3,Impassioned atheism which is worth examination,"I would like to see Richard Dawkins placed in a room with biblical creationists. I imagine there would soon be a fistfight.This book contains a series of essays by Dawkins on a range of themes, including religion. However, Dawkins anti-religious arguments are better compiled in his most recent book, the 'God-delusion.'"
1,Wasted Money,"I'm not saying this is a poor book. Although this is a simple hive of opinion, and I don't agree with many of these writings, they are still provocative for all concerned.The problem is that most of these articles can be found on the internet, so it simply isn't worth the money. It is for this reason that I do not reccomend the book.Another problem is that some of the essays are out of date, such as the ""Dolly"" controversey. This was written before she had to be put down due to rapid aging.Although Dawkins' infamous religous prejudice is not the reason for my low rating, it is ever present. Getting back to the Dolly controversey, where fundimentalists are blamed for ""slowing science,"" he obviously overlooks the secular ethical arguments against cloning, and instead points his finger at the religous.Long story short: Don't bother with a greatest hits album."
5,Always something more to learn,This is a book to sit and read. You are going to reflect why the evolutionary understanding is great!!!
3,Veers right!!! Not fun to run with!,"I originally loved this stroller, the height is perfect for me, I'm 5'10"", it's light and sturdy and love the fact that it folds up, but the more I use it, the more I hate it. (And when you're trying to get back in shape after a baby, you don't want to be turned off from exercise!) It continues to veer right now matter how often my husband has straightened it. First we thought it was the front tire, then we thought we assembled it wrong then we realized it's the frame itself. It's a shame, because it was a gift and I can't bear to tell my friend I don't like running with it. I am going to try and get a refund on it, it does have a one year warranty so hopefully they will honor it and replace it with a better model or refund me money to use toward another jogger. Hope this review helps."
2,Spokes rusting away.,"After a year and a half with this stroller, the spokes are rusting away. I've spoken to tike tech customer service and they have offered to replace the wheels at about half the cost of the stroller. Not a great solution as I imagine those will rust away too. We have never had he stroller out in the rain, or exposed it in any way more than normal. Other than that it has been pretty good. I wish the rear wheels were a little farther toward the back of the stroller as it tends to tip backwards easily. Overall it's easy to jog with."
1,TERRIBLE - buyer beware,I purchased this stroller through Tike Tech Canada. They offer extremely poor service and to top it off the stroller that I received was of sub-standard quality. Please check your goods upon arrival to ensure that the product that you receive is in working order.I would not recommend this product to anyone!
2,try another,"I am not too happy with this stroller. Although it is nice for long walks and it rides smooth over the brick sidewalks in our neighborhood, it drives me crazy. Mostly because it is really bulky when folded and it is a little time consuming to fold up when on the go. The seating area is really wide for my 6 month old and she slides around. I use the straps, but I think she is a little too small for them. She does seem comfortable; every time we go walking she is quickly put to sleep. I think I would be a lot happier with it if it folded easier and fit in the car better. Maybe check out some others before choosing this one."
3,"Great for running, nice height of the handle bars","Really am enjoying the stroller for running. The baby seems very comfortable without too much bounce. Things to be aware of are the seatbelt buckle is very difficult (extremly hard plastic) to clip and unclip; I've snapped my skin in between my thumb one too many times. Also the bar that goes in front of the baby has broken off from the snap in base of the bar. Otherwise, for the money, it is good. This is my 3rd running stroller (3rd child too) and it is a solid buy for what I use it for (approx 15 miles a week). The frame is perfect if you live near the salt air, no rust or corrosion."
1,Romantico,"Este CD es perfecto para cualquier persona que este enamorada o que estuvo enamorado.LAs canciones son muy bonitas y romanticas y la musica ni se diga, lo mejor y un buen precio tambien. Compre este CD para una novia y tenga por seguro que la enamorará"
5,Still waiting,"This is my all time favorite movie and I've been waiting years for it to come out on DVD!! I can't possibly be the only one who is waiting for it! Please, we're still waiting and longing to enjoy this classic again - do what you can to speed up the process!!"
5,Par Excellent!,"Hepburn and Cukor teamed for this, their last most perfect, shared creative effort. It is a ""drawing room"" comedy triumph, in the old style and a thorough delight to behold, and difficult to surpass, simply because the pioneer film legends themslves (Hepburn and Cukor) were still at the top of their form, and the genre was now distilled, by them, to perfection. It is a marvel on VHS (I have it), but should be translated to the dvd format, as soon as possible, for all to enjoy, into the future. Works such as ""Love Among The Ruins"" transcends ethnic and national barriers. It is a souffle that rests confortably upon the palate and the digestive system. Yes, I highly recommend it."
5,DVD!!!! WE WANT THE DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WHEN WHEN WHEN will this MASTERPIECE be released on DVD??!!! PLEASE tell me!!! There is SO much SCHLOCK out there! And this feature film is an UTTER GEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BOTH divine actors WON Emmy Awards for their portrayals! IS THAT NOT ENOUGH??!!! C'mon Folks!!!!!
1,Little Rodeo Wranglers With Miss Shir,"I think in this video it has Bareback Riding, Saddle Bronc Riding, Bull Riding, Steer Wrestling, Calf Roping, Team Roping, Steer Roping and Barrel Racing"
4,more of the same,"Enigma continues a progression into harder, more electronic music with less emphasis on dance and melody. There is almost none of the unique religious/""ethnic"" sampling found in the other albums. Still, the rhythms are inspiring and the quieter tracks quite beautiful. If you are a fan of electronic music or Enigma then you'll really like this CD. If you are new to Enigma, try the greatest hits album."
4,It was a pretty good book in general,"If you are interested in modeling, or just like that type of book it is a good book. I don't belong in the modeling part of life because I am not interested in learning about it, but I thought it was a pretty good book. It had really good descriptions and made you think."
4,High Cheekbones,"Well, I think the book was good because it talks about how Alice became a model. First a lady gave Alice a card for a famous modeling agency. So she took the card and she was very excited about becoming a model. She lives with her mother and brother. The family is on welfare because the mother is lazy to do any kind of work. I am not interested in modeling but the book I read was real good. Alice thought about alot of things like taking care of the house and her brother. All Alice's mom is thinking that she could take her money and spend it on herself. The point I am making is that that nobody should be thinking about themselves even when the money is not there.I also think that everybody should work together so they could save a lot of money so they could eat and buy each other things that they need."
1,Sebago... Not what they used to be.,First order arrived with left shoe being at least one full size larger than right shoe. Neither shoe was accurate 10.5D as ordered. Returned and received shoes that were inconsistent in size again and were poorly constructed. Quality has declined in this shoe and it is very disappointing. Seam stitching was crooked and overall quality was not worth the price.
1,split seams after 2nd wear,"I bought these for my husband who has always worn Sebago loafers, usually purchased at Nordstroms. I purchased these online to save a trip to the mall. He wore them 2 times and on the second time (several months apart as he dosen't dress up too often), the top stitching came undone! In 20+ years of wearing this brand that has never happened. I'm unsure if Amazon is selling the rejects of Sebago's or not. Amazon says it's too late to return, but they are clearly defective and their return policy stinks! I won't be buying shoes off here again!"
2,you get what you pay for?,"These shoes are ok for the price, but the uppers are 100% corrected grain (i.e. cheap, inferior leather which has been sanded down and built back up with laquers and polishes). They were full of unsightly creases after the first day I wore them. The leather soles also wear much faster than my other leather soled shoes (i.e. Allen Edmonds, Alden, Johnston & Murphy). Also, the ""penny"" holding part of these penny loafers has been glued to the upper, so you can't actually put any pennies in them (not that you'd want to, but still demonstrative of cheap construction).The fit is good -- I needed a ""B"" width, and these things don't slip off my heels.The comfort is ok -- what you would expect in a penny loafer, but not otherwise outstanding (as is the case with a cork-soled AE).Bottom line: you get what you pay for; these shoes costs me $50. But if you want quality, go buy yourself a pair of Allen Edmonds (i.e. the real deal)."
4,Wonderful fictinal-historical story,"The book was an enjoyable read, with both comedy, adventure, strong emotional attachment to the characters and well written. The book is a must read first before watching the very-well done movie."
3,OKay,I did not enjoy this as much as the reviews would have indicated. I was a little disappointed and will not race to read more of hers.
2,Restoration,"Not having earlier heard of Rose Tremain or read her other books, I had no expectations of 'Restoration'. But since it made the Booker shortlist I did expect an entertaining read.The novel starts off promisingly. The early stages of the book, where the central character - Merivel is introduced is quite entertaining, but as the novelty of the character begins to wear off the book starts to falter. ."
4,California Psychedelic Rock at its finest,"On Atomic Ritual Eddie Glass and band continue their drudge through heavy, fuzz laden tones of grit and haze. Some bands change with the music environment but Nebula stick to what they're great at and they do it up right on this 2003 release.The Chris Goss production helps to set the listener on a course right through the desert via some 1970s space wagon, complete with red earth and driving guitar riffs. To the point, this is an entertaining listen from a 3 piece that puts forth a lot of sound with plenty of hooks, great guitar work, and imagination.-ns"
4,Great listen.,"This is really kickass music! Though Nebula doesn't get the brass ring for originality, quality space rock like this just doesn't exist in comparable quality today. It's not slow, plodding, sludgy stoner rock, but spacey, energetic stoner rock/metal. Is there a difference? You bet! Just listen. The rhythms and baselines are tight, the drumming very strong, and the effervescent soloing addictively layered through each song. The songs kick along at a good pace, feeling a little like a heavier 70's Deep Purple, and make for a very enjoyable listening experience; especially with headphones."
3,Get your'e own style,"Dans l'ensemble cet album est ok. Malheureusement ces mecs ne semblent pas savoir quel type de musique ils veulent faire et ils trouvent assurément leur inspiration dans plusieurs sources...QOSTA, Kyuss, ledzepp...mais ils ne sont pas capable de bien gérer ce qu'ils veulent produire. En somme, ils n'ont pas de style propre à eux-mme. Les drifts de guitare sont très bonnes mais souvent mal placées et avec un style trop rétro pour l'ensemble musical ""spacestoner"". Album à acheter si vous tes un vendu nebula, ou que vous voulez complétez votre collection stoner..."
5,"One of the greatest ""latino"" hip hop albums.","If you are a true fan of hip hop without the gangsterism or bad boy acts with some latin soul then you should listen to this album. It's got funky beats, mellow grooves, english/spanish tracks. There's something for everyone on this album. I got the tape in 89 and haven't heard it in years but I remember all the tracks on it and it's still one of my favorite albums that most people slept on, probably because it was overshadowed by it's mega hit single Mentirosa. I can't wait to hear it on CD."
5,BROTHA WITH TWO TONGES,"MELLOW MAN ACE WAS TIGHT WITH RYHME FIGHTER. HE DISSED EAZY E ON A SONG CALLING HIM A SUCKA. NOW I WASNT COOL WITH THAT, BUT HAD TO RESPECT HIM FOR HAVING THE GUTS TO DO SO. I MEAN, COME ON, THE GODFATHER OF GANGSTA RAP. NO ONE CAN DISS HIM. NICE DEBUT ALBUM, CHECK ON THE NEXT ONE TOO, WHATS IT TAKE TO PULL A HOTTIE LIKE U WAS A CERTIFIED JOINT."
4,Old school rap,"I like that it has some spanish rap,I love old school.I would recommend this album to all those latino rap lovers."
2,broke 2nd time used,Grip 14 Gauge Electric Shears UL & CULused this tool twice results were a bolt in the head broke (holds the cutting blades) and part of the head has cracked probably from the stress of the broken bolt. Have just contacted seller and am waiting for a reply from them
5,whatever happened to,"just to let anyone interested know i went to the mary ellen mark website and she has picutres of tiny and her family now, tiny is 30 and has 7 children (mostly all from different fathers) i was sent an email that said mike (rats friend) now owns his own farm and is doing well. thats all i know, still curious as to what happened to patty, shadow, rat and the rest of them if anyone knows please email me."
4,heart wrenching,"I just rented this video and I cant get it out of my head. I cant stop wondering whatever happened to them, and where are they now. i was 12 when it was made and I couldnt imagine living like that, if anyone know what happened to any of them I would love to find out. great documentary!"
4,Streetwise,I was really impressed with how well taken care of the movie was. The shipping was really quick also!
2,Not for the beginner,"This book was is written more as reference for someone with some introduction or reference point on this subject. Although it is marketed as a beginner book, it by no means is. The language is ambiguous and the examples skip around and are not fully explained. This was my text for an introductory Oracle class and it managed to confuse the student instead of support him/her."
1,Keep Looking!,Horrible reference. The source code supplied with the book is full of bugs. The text contains numerous copy errors. The discussion on normalization is both erroneous and incomplete. Save your money!!!
1,No Proofreading - Poor Quality Writing,"There are so many mistakes that the examples are endless...but for one, pp 222-223 are terrible. Two sentences are repeated multiple times in different paragraphs. Also on p. 46, the Locical Operators table, the ""greater than"" symbol is listed as a DOT rather than a "">"". These are just two of many errors that should have been caught by basic editing/proofreading.It may answer your questions, but be careful..."
1,Total lack of QA or proofreading. Written by a programmer.,"This is the required text for the current (summer '99) CIS276 course at Strayer University. Bad choice Strayer folks! The book is full of typos and errors. Examples do not match the text references. More examples needed. Screen shots do not relate to text. Suggest the author take a look at ""Microsoft Access 97 Comprehensive / Enhanced"" by Adamski/Hommel/Finnegan, ISBN 0760073090, for a great text book. Better yet: stick to programming and let the someone else do the professional writing."
5,I disagree with the age rating - should be 3 and up....,"This is the coolest memory game to date! We got this for Christmas from my awesome, avant garde, hip sister-in-law. And we have played and enjoyed it every day since!My 2-year-old, who will be 3 in February, can easily master this game and whoop Mom or Dad's hiney. What I love are the illustrations. They are beautiful, and they also teach a whole new set of animals (i.e. lemurs, iguanas, fish swimming in coral, etc.)I highly recommend. Cards are very sturdy with visually appealing and distracting (which is good in a game like this) stripes on the opposing side. I absolutely recommend. But a 2 1/2 year old - 3 year old can easily master..."
3,Dull colors,I'm pleased with the strong multilayer paperboard squares these cards are printed on - they look very durable.However the colors are a lot duller than I imagined they would be. Looking at the product online makes the cards look as if they will be very bright.I probably wouldn't have purchased the product had I seen it in person first.
5,"Well worth the money, great toy","This is a great memory set, my 6 year old daughter loves it. The pictures are a nice change from the usual character memory, and it is very sturdy and well made, in fact I bet it will hold up well enough that my 1 year old will have them handed down to her too! Would buy again for sure!"
1,Attempting to psych you up to sing,"The two audio cassette tapes are talks attempting to psych you up to sing. The small book contains a number of songs for you to try on your own. (If you are looking for singing articulation techniques or singing examples to follow, you should also try elsewhere.)"
5,Excelent choice,It's a very complete and comprenhesive book for those who love all kind of ships and their history. It was and excelent choice.
3,Question,I've used the item to seal heating pipes/ radiators in a home. A rep at local hardware store assured me it is heat resistant. I want to make sure it won't exude smells or toxic gases when it's heated. Does anyone know?
3,Good could be better,"Pros: Concise, well written, organization. Cons: No answers available for the Study Break sidebars, answers only to review questions. This book left me looking elsewhere for more practice problems (with answers) for subnetting. I gave the author feedback on this, hoping answers would appear online."
2,fruit not yet ripe enough for picking,"I don't know what happened, it appears he went through a divorce? At any rate, not one song on this cd rises up to his best efforts...I'm not wanting Mac to churn out the same songs year after year, or recycle them, but nothing on this cd seems quite ready to be recorded....nothing even approaches the quality of his earlier music....is there a song here that you'll be humming after the cd is done? Not one. There is not a Socrates, or a Still Life....this entire cd appears to be songs he wrote for others, and recorded himself as an afterthought...or demo's he put on a cd to fulfill a contract...don't get me wrong, I love the guy, and love all of his earlier stuff....but this appears to fall far short of his ability.I wish him the best, but this is not it."
3,It's Okay,"This 5th album by Gloria Trevi is very good, however I believe Mas Turbada Que Nunca had more flavor. This new album has more of a dark atmosphere and seems like it was recorded in a week! Very good songs, although not as sophisticated and crazy as in Mas Turbada Que Nunca. I recommend it if you really like her."
5,Good Old Days,"There was nothing better than going to Las Vegas in the HeyDay and going to see shows at the casinos... Thats when entertainment was entertainment, opening act to warm up the crowds, and then the Headliner. Plus if you went to the first show, you also got dinner, midnight shows drinks only.. The shows were shows, you were enterained and TOP NOTCH headliners.. Cesars was the Best Place to see a show.. Yes I agree please find more of those recordings and release them.."
2,Not good,It doesn't really work that great. I would advise you to get the NativeRemedies Gastronic Dr. it works better.
4,Lana Cantrell CD,"I heard Lana Cantrell in Australia when she first started singing and was a big fan then. This CD is a very good collection of pieces reminiscent of that time, and her material was always interestingly selected. Not crazy about the dated cover but the songs are as good as I remember."
5,I wish she'd record more,"Lana Cantrell just gets better with time - but always great. The legal industry will not suffer if she would just record more. Lana Cantrell would leave a marvelous legacy to the world of music, her lovely voice and spirit would live forever.Come on, there's more to life than a lawsuit!"
1,Anti-Presence,"I have dozens of products from Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra that rate five stars. This product lacks the presence found in their work. The music is a sort of template constructed New Age Jazz instead of the non-rhythmic background sounds commonly found in meditative CDs. The ""whispers"" are anoyingly repeated dozens of times. The voice is irritatingly low forcing me into intense concentration. This product is of negative value (-2 stars)."
1,This is not an audio book.,"It's a sham. None of the supposedly authors' voices are heard. None of the ""quotes"" are identified. As another reviewer said, ""it's annoying"". The cheap background music tries to fill in for real substance.Snake Oil, not enlightenment."
1,Can't hear what they are saying,I love listening to these speakers on other tapes but was very dissappointed that the music on these tapes was so loud you couldn't hear what they were saying! It was very frustrating. So sad - it would probably by great for reflection and meditation IF you could hear what they were saying.
5,Very strange...,I read this book and it was very strange. The girl starts sleepwalking and then she would have a dream about the lake on Fear Street. One night she was sleepwalking and found out that she wasn't dreaming she was in the water and she almosted drowned. She thought she was dreaming but it was real and it was pretty freaky too. This book is so good and very strange.
5,Five stars for originality!,"I think this book is very original. The good thing about it was that there were so many suspects and so many things happening, that you couldn't figure out the whole ending even without reading it. That is what I like."
4,This book is a really interesting book.,I would really like to know where R.L. Stine got his idea for his Fear Street The Sleepwalker book. I really enjoyed reading this book it is my favorate out of them all. This was really interesting to read because this setting and actions happened exactly in the same way. Please write back.
2,This book was ridiculous!,"One week after she starts her summer job at Mrs. Cottler's house, Mayra Barnes starts to sleepwalk and she wakes up outside her house. Mayra thinks Mrs. Cottler is casting a spell on her since her mother once took care of Mrs. Cottler and she thinks she is getting her revenge by casting a spell on Mayra. To make things worse, a strange man seems to be following her but Mayra doesn't know him. Mayra's friend is mysteriously run down by the same man.I say the book is crazy since the explanations done by the strange man(not the real villain) were nonesense. He was trying to scare her friend by running her down? There were other parts that didn't make sense to me. How in the world did Hazel the cat make it back to Mrs. Cottler's house when the cat was injured by the villain?"
2,Prety Wired Book.....,"First of all it was a WIERD book.Great Charters and Plot, but not enough action!!!!!I was rellay dissapointed in the lack of Suspence!!It VAULED Dullness!!! And Was RICH in Long Boring Chapthers!!!But it HATED Suspence!!!And was POOR in Thrills and Chilles!!!You Should Skip this one!!!!"
4,Fun and uplifting,"This is such a great addition to my Method collection. Beth Lane is wonderful to watch and makes you feel confident as you do the moves. Lane makes the routine and moves easy by encouraging you to watch her as she does the moves. The first time I put this baby in I was sweatting and I felt a little silly doing the moves, but as I went through the routine and watched everyone on the stage I got more confident and just went for it. The background people are a nice addition and the drums bring this workout together to make this my favorite Method dance tape. NOTE: There is allot of jumping and head movements in this workout, if you have neck and back problems you will have to try to tone down the dance movements."
3,learn the moves then chunk it,"I found this tape to be so-so. After doing it for a dozen times or so, the instructor has become annoying (""you're really cooking now!"") and I now have my parts that I fast forward (since it is broken up into 3 workouts, each one has a warm-up part which is unnessecary if doing all three as one workout - once I get my heart-rate up, I like it to stay that way!).That said, it's otherwise a fun workout for rainy days. I found a few of the moves pretty difficult (the cow chugs (sp?) and the box step mostly) but I just modified them to my own capabilities. With the moves I've learned, I've been able to put them to my own music and just DANCE! (which I find more appealing than the video - ha!)"
1,high impact - low sweat factor,"I bought this video based on positive reviews here. I've never before purchased a cardio / aerobic workout video so, before deciding this one was truly terrible, I watched (and used) the other new workout videos I had ordered.This video is confusing, the instructor appears to be making it up as she goes along. If you watch the other dancers behind her, they all seem confused as well. I was initially interested because the workout is split into three shorter sessions. This really appealed to me as I am often pushed for time. Unfortunately, the workout is so light that one has to do all three to really get a decent sweat going. My biggest problem, however, is the fact it is marketed as low impact. You might never break a sweat but there are a few moves in the workout which I found downright painful. I'm going to be selling my copy as soon as possible - and not to a friend!"
3,Not sure if it's for me,"I read comments from other people and ordered this video with a great deal of anticipation. Jury is still out for me. So far it doesn't appear that my hips and shoulders move this way and I am spending so much time trying to keep up and get the moves that I don't get a good workout. I am keeping the tape and will give it a couple more chances. The instructor is very charismatic and all of her ""team mates"" are in great shape. If you like to dance and have some rythm, you should get this tape. As a pudgy, short, non-dancer, I am thinking I might be out of my league here."
3,Very good beginners,This is a very good workout based on Afro-Brazilian steps. It has other steps in it to give a rounded full body workout. Very enjoyable. Buy this video first as a beginners video then move on to African Healing Dance video [....]
2,Awkward,I wasn't a big fan of this video. She didn't explain what she was doing and she'd switch from one move to the other really quick. It's not much of a tutorial. Plus we felt super awkward doing it.
3,"Nice, but not well organized.",I enjoyed the three routines which started out with a warm-up. The moves were do-able and entertaining. It was a decent workout. I broke a sweat. I wish there was a cool down and stretch portion at the end.
3,Schubert Fantasy (Pun intended),"I am a singer, have sung Schubert leider and his choral masses. A fellow singer recommended this book to me and I was eager to read it. Because my son attended Juilliard and performed in Carnegie Hall, I enjoyed the descriptions of the protagonist's experiences there. This book is a complete fantasy, and as such, should have been a novella, not a 300-page novel. About 2/3 of the way through I began to get tired of the premise of the story and the characters themselves. I haven't finished reading it yet, so don't know the outcome, what is going to happen to Liza, and I'm not sure that I care much. The book is just too long, and the fantasy, charming at first, has worn thin for me."
1,A waste of time.,"For anyone serious about classical music this book is offensive. Wish I hadn't ordered it since after reading a few pages it ended up in the trash. It was misleading and disrespectful to use Schubert's good name and music. The book was not worthy of this association, which made me both sad and furious."
5,Unique and entertaining new novelist,"Liza Durbin is your average New York attorney on the fast track for a partnership with her firm, if the weasel new guy doesn't manage to backstab her.Then, at Christmastime while visiting her parents in Southern California, Liza inexplicably sits down at the grand piano in a Nordstrom's store and returns a virtuoso performance---of you guessed it, Franz Schubert.As the story continues, you discover that Liza is indeed possessed by the famous composer. At first awkward, she and Schubert learn to cohabit in her body--and yes, eventually 'make beautiful music together.'Unfortunately, Liza's talent draws both right and wrong kind of attention. A Juillard professor turns mentor, Liza's little sister wants to give Liza a sexpot reputation....And will the 'gift' last? ""Sleeping with Schubert"" keeps you turning pages eagerly til the last. Encore!"
5,An Irresistable Novel,"Wow! What an amazing first novel, from the first chapter I was hooked! Everyone should read this book, you will find yourself connecting to Liza even with this outrageous and completely out of the ordinary plot. If you are looking for a great summer read you shouldn't miss out on this extraordinary firstnovel. Bonnie Marson is here to stay!"
3,never again,"product requires complete assembly,but several pieces were not finished to receive the enclosed hardware. the finished product looks good but would have been a better value at half the price! the piece is all laminate and the back of the bookcase is very cheap!"
4,Beautiful witches,The worst acting you can imagine but YOU GET HOOKED. There is something about it the you get addicted to. The twisted stories maybe the screenplay.. I don't know.It is nice to have their money but not their livesNICE CARS & NICE HOUSES
5,Footballers Wives,Great show. Get to see inside the lives of english Soccer players. Scenes of guys locker room and showers so if you are embarrassed by male nudity this show is not for you. Fun drama to watch. woman on the show are really good looking.
4,"Good, trashy fun","It will suck you in. More about drama than sleaze, though, with some fairly good acting. The comparison to ""Dynasty"" is especially apt. (Axton)"
5,Great Socks,"My kids are so fussy about their socks!""Bumpies"" where the seams are made them crazy and me too!Thank you stride rite for no ""Bumpies""!"
4,Great new singing voice.,"Bemshi has a great vocal style, and could have been one of the better female artists of the 90's. Too bad the producers and record company decided to drop her after only one album in favor of some ""popular now"" artists. I wonder how many of them are still popular today?"
2,Not as pictured,"The lamp I received didn't look like the one in the picture. There was a round plastic knob on the switch, no vents in the shade, and only a single spring down the middle of each arm, rather than one on each side. I'm wondering how long it will last."
1,Cheap lamp...not as advertised,"I've had real LuxoLamps, other knockoffs that were almost as good...and now a couple of these pieces of C__P. The positive reviews make me wonder whether they're fraudulent or if the are talking about a different lamp. The little single springs are so weak they're useless. As Berger noted, they are not as shown, no vents, different shape, different switch knob. I'm just using them to hold supplemental growlites over some indoor plants. Even with pliers I couldn't tighten the ""elbow"" clamps enough to trust them not to fall on the plants, so I ended up putting metal blocking between the lower arm tubes and wrapped clear packaging tape around the two upper tubes to stabilize the thing. Definitely do not buy these expecting them to be adjustable and stable like a real drafting lamp."
1,Faulty,"This lamp will not hold a desired height between the bulb and my work. It tends to fall towards the work, no matter how hard I tighten the screws and knob."
2,Weak springs,"I bought the lamp and returned it. The company was fine about returning it. The problem with the lamp was that the springs to hold it in place weren't strong enough. Most lamps have 2 springs at each point--this one had one. Otherwise, the lamp was fine."
3,This is actually a pretty good Bratz doll!,"I hate Bratz, so I don't own this doll, but I actually think this one is kind of pretty. I like her hair and her dress. The only bad thing is her lipstick looks almost black, and she has mean looking eyes and gigantic lips, like all Bratz dolls.Since this doll is a collector's edition doll, I don't really think that many children will buy it, so it isn't that bad. If she looked like a normal person, I might actually buy this doll. I'm not sure I would reccomend this, though."
2,Okay.....,Katia is soooooooo ugly! But I love bratz! Do you know there's a new bratz name Brianna? She's Fianna's cousin. Jade's cousin is Luwenda.
5,BUYERS BEWARE,"THIS AIN'T T-NUTTY & YOUNG BOP!! IT'S MESSY MARV, GUCE & KILLA TAY AKA BULLYS WIT FULLYS. YOUNG BOP & T-NUTT AIN'T DROPPED THEIR CD YET. I GAVE IT 5 STARS CUZZ I'M DOWN WIT BULLYS WIT FULLYS BUT THIS AIN'T THE CD THEY SAY IT IS!!!"
3,Nice Shirt,"Bought this for a halloween costume I was putting together. I was glad the shirt, both material and printing, was of decent quality given the price. Met my expectations."
3,Chris Mathews Would Love It,But not me. I agree with Jim. 353 minutes of politics is too much for me. This HBO special is for the political junkie only.
4,Feels like Ranma 1/2 Season 8,"This series seemed to fall in with the original TV series where it leaves off. If you liked the original TV series then you will probably like the OVA as well. It is a little pricey since you only get 12 episodes so I can't give it a five out of five. If you are watching the seven seasons of Ranma 1/2 make sure you finish them before you watch the OVA because a character introduced at the end of season 7 (The last season) is in the OVA. It did feel a little weird that each of the two disks have different openings and closings making it feel more like two small OVA series then one OVA series. Another note about the openings and closings, the first disks closing seems way too long because they have the song then the credits instead of the credits during the song like every else does."
4,great collector's item,"This comes with a ""special collector's postcard set"", consisting of 6 postcards with full-color art. Not to mention the 'pin-up' of female Ranma on the back of the table of contents insert!Postcard 1 is Christmas themed, centering on boy!Ranma carrying Akane for some reason while random Christmas things go on in the background.Postcard 2 is Shampoo daydreaming of marrying Ranma in an elaborate ceremony."
5,OAV are better than the TV series (with one exception),"I have watched every episode of Ranma 1/2 and I can state for a fact that the OAV's are the best of all the episodes. They took the best of the manga (at the time) and turned them into a great anime OAV series. If you liked the first season you will really like this set.The only exception to this would be the ""Fake OAV"" that is towards the end. The one that deals with Kuno and the egg. I say it's a fake because it's really the 3rd movie, but it was so terrible and really short (only 40 minutes I believe). To be fair to the 3rd movie, the manga version of this story is just as bad, and I have no idea why they would pick this story to be the 3rd movie. There were so many others that could have been so much better (Herb storyline for one).If your look for closure of the tv series here, I'm sorry but there isn't any. However the OAV's do a good job of trying to continue the story. Buy this set now!"
4,Very solid jacket,"I'd been looking for a good laptop jacket for a while, then I saw they had these at J&R; so I brought my Toshiba e105 down to test the size and it fits perfectly. The green on the inside is a little bright for me, but when the laptop is inside you barely notice it. Feels well built and well stitched.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the elastic straps on the screen side of the jacket are just a little low. By this i mean that the very top corners of my screen get covered just a bit by the straps sometimes. Not a deal breaker for me since my laptop's screen has about a somewhat wide frame around it (lookup the toshiba e105 to see what i mean). But if your laptop has an Edge-to-Edge screen, the straps might be too low for you."
1,I did not want a casette. I thought it was a CD.,"The info. at the top of the page made me think this was a CD, not a cassette. Somewhere, in small print, allegedly it says it was a cassette.I had typed into the SEARCH window ""CD."" I did NOT type in ""cassette."" Why cassette tapes also came up in the list, I do not know. I emailed the seller, & told them what happened.They said that they did NOT give full refunds. Thus, it was not worth sending it back. I am extremely unhappy with this transaction.If I type into the SEARCH window, ""CD,"" then cassettes should NOT be coming up on the list for the CD that I wanted. I have no use for this cassette, & I wasted my time & money. I will not buy from this seller again."
5,best album ever,"this cd is ... amazing, it has the best beats, voices and lyrics i've heard in a while. Yuk is back,, better than ever, if u actually like good music you will get this cd. not one song will dissapoint you, peace"
3,Large Center Hole,"Writes perfectly every time. Prints nicely, too. My only problem with these Dual Layer Printable DVDs is that there is a large gap in the printable white coating around the center hole. Obviously no media is going to have white coating right up to the 1.75 cm hole, but all my other printable CDs and DVDs have about a 2.5 cm area that you have to plan for when creating your covers, where these RiData's have almost twice that at 4 cm. That's a big hole in the middle of your DVD picture that you have to plan for. Not a big deal when you're just putting some text, and maybe an additional small graphic on the disc, but if you, like me, make really nice DVDs that look like they might have been created by a movie studio, then it's a really huge hole in your graphic!Other than that, these work fine for me. Good price, and realiable burning and it's really hard to find PRINTABLE double layer discs at all."
1,Poor compatibility,"I had about a 15% success rate burning these disks at half the rated speed (I usually always burn my disks at half rated speed to reduce the number of errors, except for 2.4x media which I burn at rated speed). I burned only at 4x and used both a Plextor 716SA and 755SA with the latest firmwares (1.11 and 1.08 respectively) on two different computers. I only had 2 successful burns out of 12 attempts with many different ISO's/MDF+ISO's and burning programs (I figured since the pack was open, I may as well at least try to get them working).As mentioned above by another reviewer, I normally buy Verbatim 2.4x DVD+R DL ink jet printables, the 20 pack spindle, and have usually a 95%+ success rate at 2.4x."
2,Not so good for me,"I did not have very good luck with these Ridata discs.I have one DVD player that is rather picky and it would not play these discs. I had mixed results in my other players - one had no problems and another played, but with some pixelation.For over two dollars per disc, I expected better results, so I returned these. The Amazon return process was so easy it was almost fun, and I got my full refund confirmed today. GREAT SERVICE, Amazon!!!Please keep in mind that some combinations of burners and discs work better than other combinations, so maybe these will work for you. My burners are NEC ND-3520A and ND-3550A.I ordered a pack of a different brand which worked great for me. They were more expensive (same ""price"", but for a pack of only 20 vs. 25), but they worked great for me, so sometimes it's worth the extra bucks... and you can quote me ""verbatim"" on that. (wink wink)"
1,Will not work with Dymo Disc Printer,"Of course the primary reason to spend the money on ""printable"" dual-layer DVD+Rs is to..........print on them. While I have not experienced the compatibility problems as expressed by the readers above I must, unfortunately, report that these DVDs refuse to work with my fabulous Dymo disc printer (brand new...). After extensive emails with Dymo on this they sent me an entire spindle of blank DVDs etc. of different brands (now there's a fabulous company that's got me as a customer for life) to test out. The RiData DVDs would NOT PRINT on this printer. Strange, huh! Anyway, the RiData were the only brand that my printer rejected. And these blank media are NOT exactly cheap...so I was very frustrated with RiData. Consequently, I am led down the path to purchase the far more expensive Verbatim instead.Highly UNRECOMMENDED....."
5,Serrat by others,The great Spanish/Catalonian bard's songs sungs by others:excellent! Complement with volume two and the two volumesof Cuba canta Serrat.
5,Un tributo a la musica de un genio,"Rara vez me gusta tanto un album de tributo a ningun artista. Parece dificil para un fanatico poder asimilar versiones de los mejores temas de su artista favorito. Pero en ""Serrat Eres Unico"" se combina lo mejor del talento hispanoamericano del momento, para rendir tributo a la musica de un genio: Joan Manuel Serrat.Grabado en 1996, el album destaca particularmente por las participaciones de Diego Torres, quien versiona la legendaria ""Penelope"" de manera impecable; Carlos Varela, a cargo del encantador tema ""Esos Locos Bajitos""; y Ketama, interpretando una inolvidable version de ""Aquellas Peque&#65533;as Cosas""."
3,Buyer Beware -- incorrect product image!,"These pens work fine and truly are 'low odor', but the picture DOES NOT match what you're ordering. You are actually ordering ONE (1) set of FOUR pens. The image is that of SAN81047 (a 20 pen set).Granted, the description states ""Four-Color Sets"", but can still be confusing. I thought I was getting a screaming good deal for 20 pens, turned out I got a very average deal on a set of 4.Just a heads up."
4,No variety for jerk cats,"My cat is a jerk and will only eat the ocean whitefish, so this variety pack was a waste of money for me. Certainly not the fault of Amazon or the makers of the product. Anyone want a jerk cat? Oh, yes, he bites."
1,Don't ever buy from this seller!,I brought a set of 9 canon ink cartridges from this seller: black and color... None of them worked... I had to throw them in the garbage! I didn't use them in time to discover that and return them (late 1 week)...
1,Worthless,"I tried these and they not only leak when you open them, they produce totally worthless washed out photos that are useless."
2,"Low price, Low quality",The price is great and the ink prints well enough. The problem I had is the same as someone else mentioned. When I opened the black cartridge it shot ink all over. I was lucky to be on a tile floor and able to clean it quickly but it took days to get the ink off of my hands and it never came off of my pants. You may pay more for the name brand inks but you'll spend less time installing and cleaning up later.
3,Papua New Guinea travels..Interesting but economically written,"My Dad was raving about this book and I had to get it via the UK. The book describes Ms. Dodwell's epic tour of the island.She has many interesting challenges and adventures during her time there. The problem is the book reads rather ""flat"" and dull.At one point she quotes from her diary, and it is far more lively and descriptive than the day to day account the book provides.True, it's a travel account, so it is what it is, but I have read others that were a little more spicy in the accounting.3 stars as it wasn't really a page turner and I had to struggle through it at times."
5,Superb!!!! An exciting travel adventure,"Dodwell is a courageous adventurer, who traveled alone through Papua New Guinea. Her story is enthralling. I truly admire her!Read it for yourself. At any age, this book is great!"
1,Poor design,More of a child's toy than a utensil. The prongs are so blunt they are good only for something like piercing mashed potatoes and yogurt.
5,hard hat,Excellent hat for the ladies in construction or some fem men. Maybe a rock group (village people). Easy adjustment of size.
4,Book is better that the last review,"I don't usually write reviews, but I was prompted by the previous review. I was looking for this book because I had given my copy to my son and I wanted another. I have been an amateur photographer for more than 30 years, so I guess that the jargon was not a problem. Digital and film have much in common, but there are some serious differences, highlight loss or blowout to mention just one. I found this book provided me with the insight (within the limits of digital cameras) that I needed to make digital photographs as good or sometimes better than conventional photos"
4,"Great book for Beginners, Chocked Full of Information","I really enjoyed reading the Braun brother's book, ""Learn Digital Photography in a Weekend"". I appreciate the authors no nonsense and humanistic approach to teaching the basics of digital photography. The sections on nighttime shooting, image resolution and color correction were some of my favorites to read. One of the books pluses is that it's loaded with important information and it's easy to read. The downside of this book is the lack of color examples. For example, it's hard to see the effects of lossy, color resolution and photo sharpening with a simple black and white image. I suggest that in thier next book to add more color images for examples. Otherwise this book is worth the money because of the information alone. I would definitely read it again."
1,Belkin Card Reader,"The problem with this card reader is, new 4GB cards are high capacity (HC), and this reader won't read HC cards. It is, therefore, unacceptable for the newer SD cards coming out."
1,Plastic Junk,I expected more from Belkin but this doesn't live up to their standards. Obviously they bought a bunch of made in China junk and slapped their name on it without checking to see if it was garbage. It is hard to insert cards and they don't go in straight. This product couldn't get any cheaper if it was made of paper! Forget Belkin get a Delkin DDREADER-41 for $16.95 on Amazon.
3,Beginner?,"I have mixed feelings about this and other tapes in the Living Arts/Gaiam series. I feel that they offer good workouts, but are NOT for beginners.I'm familiar with yoga postures, having had a daily practice over 10 years ago. But Rodney Yee never offers modifications for the postures or ways to build up to being able to do them.A backbend? I haven't managed a full backbend that easily since I was 12. He doesn't offer ANY tips on how to build the strength to get there.He has the student go into a ""push-up"" position, which requires a great deal of tricep strength and no way to build to that point. (The way to build to it would be to start in plank pose and slowly lower down.)If you are a true beginner with little strength or flexibility, stick with Yoga Zone or Linda Arkin until you are stronger."
2,Beginners beware!,Don't let the title mislead you. This is a VERY difficult workout. This video is for people in great shape and lots of expertise in yoga.
2,Not a Beginner's tape,"I purchased this tape with the idea that it was a beginner's tape. However, it is not at all. I am not an expert in yoga but I do know that yoga excercise should not hurt. The tape is quiet but Mr. Lee goes to fast, and a person perfoming these exercises will have to pause the tape to adjust several positions."
2,Good Price for a Not so Good Product,"This S-Video cable did not fit any of my standard S-Video connections. I had to trim the plastic modeling around the heads to fit it into my Dell projector, Dell laptop, and DVD player.The cable produced a weak signal with faded color and one connection end was damaged upon receipt. If the cable was not bent a certain angle the signal would skip or display a colorless image.I should have attempted to return it before it was too late. I will still use it, but only as an emergency back up.Spend a little more money and buy better quality."
2,All Star Health,"I have been buying Nutrivision for several years from All Star Health, and they always sent me bottles with a 1 or 2 year expiration on the bottles. The last bottle I recently received had a 5 month expiration date, which means that the product was sitting on the shelf for 1.5 years.If I were you, I would find another company to purchase this product from, I know I will."
2,Too overdone.,"""Strange Bedfellows"" is a very long-winded play concerning the reading of it, and I'd imagine performing it and watching it as an audience member would be the same. When reading, I felt that the two playwrights, Florence Ryerson and Colin Clements, expected the reader to be fully familiar with the history of the Women's Suffrage (do brush up on your history if you plan on reading/seeing this play). And, I felt the ""inside knowledge"" everyone had about the ""certain women"" was barely shared, and I felt left out of the action. To perform if, a lot of stamina would be needed for the actors and actresses, as this is a lengthy play with full costumes and quick dialogue. For audience members, I'd say you need the Cliffs Notes for this time in history, and a great attention span. I so very much wanted to enjoy reading this play dealing with an important time in our history, and I was looking forward to the humor, but I couldn't wait until it was over. I do not recommend."
1,Didn't work,Product arrived on time but didn't work. Had a good price but on exchange Amazon's vendors changed and the price went up a lot. Almost like a bait and switch. Would have been a great addition to the house if it worked or was replaced.
4,"So far, so good","I haven't completed the book, but I have started it without the audio supplement (which Amazon does not sell, and I cannot find anywhere anyway).It's set up as a course, with tons of vocabulary in every chapter. Very meaty, with good drills. Not set up as a phrase book, and the appendix dictionary is only Behasa Indonesia to English.Many drills, and they are indeed good exercises, but I would really like to see this book come with an appendix of tables for the various prefixes. Instead, such tables can only be found in the appropriate lesson chapters.So far, this is the best Behasa Indonesia language course I've found. I find it handy to have a supplemental dictionary with this."
1,DONT BUY THIS MOTHERBOARD,"Hello there, as a entusiast computer maniac, i love high performance pieces... so when i saw this motherboard i thought that it was great... and when it arrived(in Costa Rica) i find out that it is not working... so am trying to return it to amazon, but their answers are like riddles... but theres more, you can visit the ASUS forums, and youll see that this problem is constant and that asus isnt paying any attention to its customer... PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOTHERBOARD"
4,"not really ""Best""","I Love Sting & usually ""every little thing he does is magic"", but this was not one of his best albums (in my opinion). I think the next cd will be The Police, & i'll be happier with that choice."
5,cant wait,Cant wait to get this. The only flaw with vol 1/2 was that side B of disc 2 was so badly scarred up it's unwatchanle. I hope this new vol is better made.
5,MORE Quincy!!,"Like everyone else I have waited years for the 3rd and consequent seasons of Quincy M.E. to be released, but to our dismay they haven't been. Not all of the fans of this show are elderly. I'm only 24 but became a fan of the show years ago when A&E aired re-runs of it. I was very excited to find it on DVD but 13 or so episodes is only a taste of this great series. Please release more, or sell the series to a company that will!"
5,Quincy Rules!,"I love Qunicy, and Jack Klugman was the perfect actor for the part! This series was a good balance between drama, mystery, and medicine. I remember watching episodes on TV when I was younger, so it was nice to find these on DVD. My only complaint is that there aren't more seasons available through Amazon."
5,Good series,This was a good series in it time. Jack Klugman really brought his character to life. Got it for my brother for Christmas. Came in good time.
2,Don't buy from Universal till the whole series is out,I've waited about three years for the third and fourth season of Quincy and a couple of other series as well. I then noticed everything I'm waiting on is realesed by universal.Easy enough I will not buy any series anymore that universal comes out with till they release the whole series.To me universal is the dell of the video world oh wait they might not be that bad but close.Yes I do realize that I did not capitalize universal or dell becuase they do not deserve my time or effort in hitting the caps.LOL
2,"Interesting, but lacking...","While I really enjoyed ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" and I was speechless when I read the lyrics to ""Ashes"", I'm somewhat disappointed in this CD as a whole. It sounds just like most of her other cd's/albums; there's no variety. I could have been listening to any other cd. Bonnie Raitt was definitely a great person to work with and she certainly added a lot. I won't, however, be rushing out to buy my own copy. I'll wait for the next cd and see if it's any better."
1,Paying for her therapy,"Being a long time Cris fan, I went out and purchased this CD right away. Perhaps I should have waited for reviews. This album is nothing more than the weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth of a once so talented woman. The only two songs that hold any merit are ""Cry, Cry, Cry"" - and that is because Bonnie Raitt carries the song, and the acoustic song about letting the girl go. Well, it is time to let her go!"
5,Lee descendants,"Ingmar has done an excellent job in gathering all the necessary information about the Lee (Lie) familycoming to the USA. Since there were 11 brothers and sisters in the family, it was no easy task incompiling the necessary data to complete his book. However, the last copy I have is from aboutthe year 1968, and I would like to get an updated version, if that is possible."
1,"Great music, wretched sound","I just got this from Amazon second party sellers, and I'm glad the label deleted this, because the sound is quite horrible. Distorted, dubbed from disc, mono source playing in stereo with stereophonic surface noise. Garbled and quite horrible.Earl King was one of the better New Orleans singers of the era, but this ""introduction"" is musically great, but sonicallly below bootleg quality."
4,Solid Introduction To A New Orleans Legend,"""An Introduction To Earl King"" is a very nice collection of songs from the legendary New Orleans blues/R&B; singer famous for recording the often-covered ""Let The Good Times Roll"".That song, plus other gems such as ""Nobody Cares,"" ""Up On The Hill,"" ""This Is What I Call Living,"" and other tunes demonstrate his rich, powerful voice, and strong but sometimes subtle guitar work.Another bluesman who might otherwise be overlooked, this record will help to make sure that Earl King gets his due."
2,Speed kills.,"""SPEED KILLS"" is a common slogan in road-safety campaigns around the world. It is also an apt metaphor for the way Scherchen has conducted these two Beethoven symphonies. It's as if they had been recorded immediately after a telephone call from Mrs. Scherchen admonishing her husband not to be late yet again for dinner.The majesty, the idealism and the passion of the ""Eroica"" are not totally absent, but they have been pushed into the background by relentless speed and directionless energy. The same can be said for the charm, the color and the lyricism of the ""Pastorale"".These idiosyncratic performances are lively enough, but they suffer from a lack of soul--that most outstanding of Beethoven's qualities."
2,Unexplainable Beethoven ` s readings!,"Hermann Scherchen was in a very special day when decided to record these Beethoven Symphonies: I have never listened them previous or later played with such urgency sense; a true greyhound race. The tempos are hyper fast, without expression and colour, the artistic gamut of his talent shone by its absence. Both works are pregnant of lightness and character that seem have recorded as a proof of works Anti Beethoven.Go for any other recording unless you are collector of weird versions, I bought this CD but the only fact to make a gift of it would be to offence that friend.Maybe this is the worst artistic register of Scherchen. Failed and distorted Beethoven. A hallucinating aberration."
3,Great interpretations but...,"She's clearly a soprano and these pieces are too low for her. And on sustained notes, she sings sharp. I prefer hearing these sung by a lower and richer voice. Still and all, glad to have them on a recording, so thanks for that."
4,Pure Delight Found In Simple Story,"There's not a great deal of depth to the story told in this film, but there is a great deal of richness in it's simplicity. When four of the five graduating seniors (biggest graduating class in 20 years) receive their diploma's, they'll be packing there bags, getting on the bus, and leaving Dancer for Los Angeles, Population 13 million... or so they've planned since they were 12. The richness comes from the other 77 residents of Dancer who are all placing bets on how many (if any) of the youth will make the journey. Some of the very best moments come from the misguided impressions and fears the townspeople have of LA, ""I'd be frightened by the earthquakes. They have one every few days and in between there's fires, floods, and riots.""Dancer, Texas Pop. 81 is a delightful film. Well worth watching!"
3,"Goodbye, Dancer, Hello, Modesto","Entertaining enough, and the half-tender, half-hazing relationship among the boys is well acted and feels true. But hey, haven't we seen Squirrel before? Yep, his name was Toad and he lived in Modesto and he dropped flags for drag races in American Graffiti. A country soundtrack replaces Wolfman Jack; a different number of the four young males leave Dancer than leave Modesto; the mode of transport is also different, bus vs. Magic Carpet Airways, but otherwise this is deja vu all over again. A small, modest movie, whose biggest fault is to go not so boldly where others have dared before."
2,"You've heard of chick flicks, well here's a hick flick.","This hillbilly, trailer-trash film is not recommended for those who don't eat their drumsticks with the feet still on. The plot is to contrived; the film lacks imagination."
5,A loving look at leaving home,"""Dancer, Texas, Pop. 81"" is a loving look at small towns, small-town people, and leaving (or not leaving) home. The characters remind me of those in my own small town, and the small town presented here is like small towns everywhere; it just happens to sit out in the wide-open spaces of Texas. The relationships of the boys with their families are realistic; it's interesting that only one of the boys is fleeing his family. Performances that are particularly appealing are John's little sister, Josie; Terrell Lee's dad; Earl the storekeeper, and Squirrel. Don't forget the magnificent scenery of Jeff Davis County. Anyone who ever left home, or who even wanted to leave home will love this film. You'll walk away with a smile on your face and tears in your eyes."
2,Hurry up and leave...so I can turn this off!,"Okay, I will admit that there were a few scenes here that touched me...but those heartwarming moments aside this movie is extremely dull and slow moving and really has no merit whatsoever. It's the coming of age story of four young men who graduate high school with plans on leaving town, a promise they made to each other that only one of the boys even wants to keep. This causes problems for them, fights ensue and then there's a happy ending. The problem is that getting to that happy ending is so boring. Nothing happens that holds your interest. I mean, I never really 'want' to turn off a movie, mostly so I can finish and write me opinion, but I was struggling to care about this movie. The young actors are a good bunch, but the script they were given doesn't allow you to care much for them. If you're gonna have a movie full of slow moving conversation at least make them talk about something we wanna hear."
2,Nice try. Good locale. No return trip planned.,"I was looking for a 'small' film filled with goodcharacters. The premise was enough, fine with me. 4 guys in a smalltown trying to decide if they will move on to the big city. You don't need much of a plot if the characters are good. The comic relief character is not well written and directed without restraint. The Robin Williams-Jar Jar Binks like character doesn't cut it. It even weakens the main premise. The other 3 main characters are surprisingly serious about their futures and that makes it interesting. But it is unlikely that they would take this idiot to the big city with them. They tried to mix pathos and slapstick in one character and it didn't work. My advice-- take that character and go against the stereotype somehow, please. Either make him smart and clumsy or dumb but hard-working ( a paper route in a town of 81 can't be hard work). Maybe give him a girlfriend. Something."
2,I'D LEAVE THIS TOWN TOO!,"YET ANOTHER ""INDIE"" FILM; THIS ONE A COMING OF AGE STORY OF 4 FRIENDS. SHOULD HAVE MADE 1 OR 2 OF THE 4 GUYS GAY TO MAKE IT AT LEAST A LITTLE INTERESTING. A CROSS BETWEEN THE OUTSIDERS AND THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. THIS MOVIE WAS AS DULL AND BORING AS THE TOWN!"
3,Monochromatic sludge,"This is the only Evoken disc I've heard and I like their slow, sludgy, grind....however, that's all that they offer. I agree with an earlier review that a bit of a tempo change would help. As a whole, it becomes a bit boring on it's own, however it would be a great addition on a mix CD of similar music."
2,Storage box,"The box was nice, but was delivered without a lid. I sent an email to the company and did not receive any response back. It doesn't work too well to store things without a lid."
4,the land of ice and snow,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYThe author wisely deals with them as warriors first before going on to detail their ships, seamanship, exploration, and so on. The stunning photographs steal the show as they place the reader in the locales where these people lived and died."
5,Beyonce does it again.,"First the smash single Crazy in Love and now another great single Baby Boy. The beat is hot, Beyonce is a great singer and Sean Paul helps make this track even better. You should also see the video, Beyonce looks very sexy in it."
2,Dark Diva,"For Beyonce Knowles, she has had quite a year proving herself as a incredible force behind, and outside Destiny's Child. Unfortunately, I can't say the exact same thing with this song. To me, it is nothing but the pits. Her latest song, Baby Boy, is a very dark melodic, and overly-produced hypnotic song. To me, the song isn't as catchy, or as upbeat as Crazy In Love was with Jay-Z. Not only that, but Rapper Sean Paul seems to carry more of the weight than Beyonce does here. To be honest with you, I think she needs Destiny's Child right about now. The music world doesn't have room for the female groups anymore, and could use it right now."
2,Tiny,"This is so tiny that it is difficult to read JESUS in the center. If you are looking for TINY, this is it, however if you want it to witness or to catch someones attention you may want to go bigger."
5,The Queen of Tupelo,"The songs on this album come alive - they are uplifting, heartbreaking, sentimental and humorous. After listening to the entire album you find that you have experienced every emotion possible. I highly recommend this album - as a must have!!! It has something for everyone."
5,Phenomenal talent! I'm anxious to hear more Patrick!,"Patrick Weathers is undoubtedly a gifted singer/songwriter who has produced a fine example of creativity and talent in ""The Queen of Tupelo"". That compelling voice of great range and unique styles is quite captivating in ""You Got To Move On"". The deep, touching first note pulls straight from the heart. The song unfolds with a brilliant drive of emotions as he sings of loving someone ""a little too much"". The upbeat ""Opelousas Jamboree"" is a fun song that really takes you there. ""Old Friends, Old Times"" is a beautiful, sentimental tune that touches us all. I love ""House Party"" and can't stop singing it! I sooo want to see the guys and babies that ""look like Mr. Clean"" with the ""bald heads and tiny earrings"". This CD is a keeper, right in there with Lyle Lovett, Dylan, Prine, Cash and enough spice to fit in there with Buffett, too."
5,good job patrick,"My daughter and I have known Patrick for about 10 years, we first meet when she was 14, and been with him for many years as he traveled to many citys with the musical Elvis , He shold have been the star of this show, for he had more talant in his little finger then any other person in the show. I bought the cd for my daughter Bobbi Leigh as a surprise, she was delighted to receive it. Patrick voice is only gotten better, and we wish him the best in all that he does.Cheryl Stansky706-276-4906lizzie@ellijay.com"
5,Down to Earth,"While not everyone out there smokes weed, Weeds is much more then just about the green plant. We can easily find ourselves in one of these characters or now a friend that matches to one perfectly. It's a very well written work and I only hope the keep true in the second season.The DVD also features a makeing-of and documentry that are very funny.If you need some new and cleaver one-liners, this is the show for you."
5,Weeds Season One,This series shows how people can go with the flow - and the flow can be all downhill heading for white water and the waterfall. I am looking forward to Season Two DVD.
5,Weeds is the best show on the air!,This show is one of the best shows of its time it gives you comedy and drama all in the same show. Any show where the only way you can make a living is by selling pot makes any t.v. show intresting.
1,rating for the dvds not for the series itself,"I wanted to put up a caveat for other fans who watch the show in HD. Even though the show aired in widescreen on HD, the discs are the fullscreen version. Yuck!"
4,Unexpected gem of a show,"Could a pot dealing suburban mom be a hit in the U.S. How could it not with such a charming, outstanding cast and witty scripts. This is one of the most original comedies I've seen in ages."
3,WARNING!! NOT IN WIDESCREEN.,I'm POed! I watch this on showtime widescreen hi-def every week and then I buy the the DVD expecting the best available package and I get plain old 1.33 ratio! As far as I can tell it's not available in widescreen (yet-I hope)... Great show! I will re-buy in widescreen and sell my 1.33 ratio to some retro want-to-be.
3,Worth a look at even if you don't smoke pot,"I love the intro to the show and the premise is different from other shows. I've caught myself humming the jingle at times, very catchy tune! Most of the dialogue is witty and loaded with sarcasm. I really like Cecelia, she cracks me up. The content may be too vulgar for some viewers. For me, the satire wore off in parts of episodes and I found myself getting bored sometimes. I enjoyed the show more when I watched one episode at a time. The episodes are only 30 minutes long so it's probably intended to be watched like a sitcom anyways. This show is like a R rated Arrested Development (which is a good show too; if you like Weeds or The Office you will probably like that show also)"
4,The Show Gets 5 stars....,"...but the DVD release knocks off a star for only being 1.33:1. Come on, guys, this was made widescreen - so why is the DVD not widescreen as well?Ignoring that, this is the second best thing on Showtime these days (right after Penn and Teller's BS). Almost everything I hate about suburbia is skewered left right and center. Make no mistake - this is not reality - this is a subdivision out of the Twilight Zone."
2,Just Not Funny,"I watched the first 4 episodes from season one because I heard a few people talking about the show. Just simply not very funny. I may have chuckled a couple times in the entire 4 shows I watched. It's a little sleazy, which would be ok if it was funny. Maybe someone can tell me what parts are funny, I couldnt find them."
3,a mediocre show,"The show is ok. It has more of a sitcom feel than a premium cable drama/""soap opera"" style... by which I mean the continuity is pretty negligible. Don't expect things to carry over from episode to episode. I don't think it represents the reality of suburban life or pot smoking very well. Regardless, it is worth a (skeptical) watch."
1,Confusing,"I can't understand the high ratings for this series. Is it a comedy that is not funny or a drama without any emotional connection with the viewers? The lines are predictable, the characters underdeveloped, and the premise very weak. It does not portray situations either realistically or humorously. I was very disappointed after the Sopranos and Six Feet Under which both stand head and shoulders above this series. I wasn't even interested enough to watch the last episode."
5,Late to the game,"I was ""late to the game"" on Weeds but I have thoroughly enjoyed catching up. Fantastic writing and performances."
5,"Clever, funny, not to be missed","What a fun show! 100% captivating and entertaining. I never thought I'd be sympathetic about a drug dealing single mom, but I totally am! It is so funny, so charming, and nothing but superb wit. Buy it or rent it, and then loan it to all of your friends!"
3,Just a little slow for me,"I really thought this series would be a little more exciting. It all and all was not bad, but it was really boring and slow in the beginning. Once they set up characters and story line it starts to get more interesting. By the time the series is over you indeed want to see the second season."
1,vulgar,If you like to laugh at people at they're worst then this is the show for you. Another disapointment from Showtime.
1,No Pilot included?,Not widescreen? More reason to just download it :PNo pilot episode on here? That's the only reason I was even LOOKING at the dvd's..Great show.. Shame the dvd's don't live up..
1,"Unlikeable Characters, Unlikeable Series","A contrived plot line, perhaps the most unlikeable cast of characters to yet appear in a TV series, and a nasty undertone -- beginning with the opening credit's musical ""theme song"" -- make ""Weeds"" a major disappointment. I enjoy series like ""Breaking Bad, Dexter, and even The Riches -- because at least some of the characters have an appeal. but the same can't be said for Weeds. I don't buy the suggestion that this was the writer's intention -- frankly, the show is too poorly written to even believe that there is a clever message simmering below the surface. Weeds is just a bad show."
5,Couldn't stop watching,"I thought this was great, nice development of the characters and interweaving plots. I stayed up late to watch ""just one more episode"".Mar Loiuse Parker is very good in it."
4,Not your regular run-of-the-mill program.,"I found the show very entertaining. It starts a bit slow but overall it is very good. I enjoyed it so much I bought season two and am now watching season three.If you can appreciate dark humour and aren't sensitive to profanity, porn, and pot you should enjoy this program too."
3,Love the Series - Poor HD quality,"Plenty of reviews speak to the quality of the series content, so I will not spend space on that. I will simply say that love the Weeds series and its characters, situations, and relationships.However, I find the HD transfer very poor on this title. To me, it looks no better than a standard DVD upconvert.Now, I must say that the later seasons have fixed this problem, and only the first season suffers this problem. That said, I see no significant benefit in choosing the Blu-Ray version over the standard DVD version."
3,Good show; too much foul language,Good plot; too much bad language though. Picture quality is pretty weak for blu-ray; not the crisp picture I was expecting.
1,waste of money,"Way too much trauma not enough laughs. Bought this based on critics' review, which normally I tend to ignore, should have this time and would have saved my money and time. Now they say 2nd season is better than first, I don't trust them and not buying the 2nd season. If you want to see something well written and funny, do yourself a favor, get Wonderfalls DVD which has all 13 episodes, they only showed 4 episodes on tv and the dumb network canceled it (wrong time slot and not enough viewers, the dingdongs didn't give it time, like Seinfeld was almost canceled), thank heavens, they made a dvd."
1,How low can we sink? stay tuned and find out.,"If you want raunch, T&A, soft core porn and naaastay, then, you've found the hog wallow of your dreams. Roll around in the offal and luxuriate in modern American culture."
1,My first scratched BD disc (Weeds S1),"This review is about the product itself, not the Weeds TV show because I still have not seen it due to the reasons mentioned next:I'm usually satisfied when I order dvds/blu-rays or pretty much anything else from here. But when I tried getting Weeds S1 to work, my PS3 couldn't read it, I popped in all my other BD discs and it read each and every one. I got suspicious so I checked under the disc. There I found scratches unlike any I had ever seen before, you could feel them running your fingers on them. they were really bad and deep. My guess is this is a factory flaw, because this disc came super sealed (sideways and up and down) and the disc was in it's place safe and secure. Little good that did since apparently it was damaged (defective) from the start.I just hope no one else had the same experience I did. Especially since I live in Kuwait and it's cheaper for me to buy another one than ship it back."
4,Reefer Gladness,"""Weeds"" is a nice mix of comedy and drama that is both touching and witty, and maybe a bit shocking for those not used to watching too much HBO stuff like ""Six Feet Under"". Season one shows a good balance of the pros and cons of this business, and one struggling mother coping with all sorts of dilemmas. Good performances from all, tough the main black charachter Heylia James (Tonye Patano) seems a bit OTT - especially for us europeans. Keavin Nealons smoker happy dude Doug Wilson is a blast, and Mary-Louise Parkers Nancy Botwin is something to cherish. Good woman.And I sure want to make one of those recipes included on the DVD. Yummy! Recommended for you all you HBO-junkies who can't get enough. Yeah, I know it's on Showtime. We don't get that in Europe..."
4,The one star review simply is not true.,"Disregard the prior review. It simply is not true. While the picture quality might not rank among the absolute top tier of HD transfers available for either format (and very few do), it is still a very clear, very high def image that I'd give between 3 1/2 and 4 stars. I had a few episodes of season 1 saved on my DVR in high def. The Blu-ray image blows away the broadcast image in terms of clarity and the absence of compression artifacts. The one star reviewer either got a defective copy or doesn't have his system set up right.Oh, the show's great too."
5,The Grass Really IS Greener!,"I had heard about the show recently from some friends who, uh, knew about a previous business I'd been involved in many years ago... I figured what the heck and from the pilot episode to the end of the first season, I simply could not stop watching- I stayed up all night! The show reveals what veils suburban America hides behind, and to a certain extent, what it's hiding. More insightful- and more fun- than Desperate Housewives, this is what Kevin Spacey might well have done with American Beauty if he'd been working in a series format. The entire cast is uniformly excellent and colorful- it's as if I had described a bunch of my old buddies to the producers. There is more real America here than all of reality tv put together. I ordered the rest of the available seasons the moment the menu came up showing that I'd sat through every episode. I hope they're this good! Warning! This show is more addicting than growing your own- take it from someone who knows!"
5,Weeds,This is a truely great show! Very Entertaining! lots of laughs!The father dies and mom starts selling weed to make ends meet. She's just not to light brite on how to do it.You'll love the cast and the antics. Two thumbs up! Great buy!
2,doesn't look like image,I was pretty disappointed when I received the item in the mail. It looks much brighter (both the white background and stripes) in the image than it looks in person. I recommend finding it in a store instead of online.
5,Beautiful Sodalite,"Another beautiful item from SilverSpeck. I wondered about how fragile they would be with six beads, but they aren't loose at all. The pair I have shows all the beautiful shades of Sodalite. I was so glad to find this style and in one of my favorite stones."
1,Poor at Best,"This author fills the book with needless details. He makes a hero out of Bill Nagle, the captain of the dive boat, a hopeless alcoholic who should have had his master's license revoked years before three people were lost to this wreck. With the exception of John Chatterton, the only diver who seemed competent, you were listening to a story of people who had death wishes. The fact that the Coast Guard had to send rescue helicopters to save this collection of incompetents baffles the imagination. The author presents as fact details of several occurrences happening 50 years ago; hard to believe. Creativity at its best - and this book is classed as nonfiction."
2,A fatal flaw,"This a fascinating story which is generally well-told, but the whole reading experience is marred by an excessive amount of profanity. Maybe some people talk like this, particularly in the diving profession, but the story could have been told without subjecting the rest of us to it. Check out the DVD instead (""Hitler's Lost Sub""); there you can enjoy the story without being covered in vile language."
1,Book was falling apart,"When I received this book it was in very bad condition. Pages were falling out, spine was broken and many pages had whole paragraphs underlined. I read it but it only had that one read left in it."
2,Dead Rat Floating In The Stew,"This is a very interesting book, portraying how super achievements above and beyond the call of duty are possible when the human spirit embraces true commitment to a cause.John and Ritchie exemplify sacrificial and highly unusual devotion to a noble mission, and allow nothing to distract them from their goal.The writer's style is captivating, so that reading the book is like flowing with a stream rather than paddling against a current. It's an easy read.However, I cannot recommend this book to anyone because of the author's frequent inclusion of profanity and obscene language by those who have never learned which end of their body is provided for defacation, so they use both ends. This potty-mouth language is totally unnecessary and is like a decomposing, dead rat in an otherwise bowl of delicious stew."
5,Great Read!,"Absolutely a fantastic book. Not only the solving of the identification of the boat but the history of the crew, and the research that went into solving it. If you are a diver or a military history buff, or love to read about a true life adventure you will love this book. Highly recommended."
4,Dive In to a Real Mystery,"When most most stories claim ""based on a true story"" which most often means ""very loosely based on... and we took alot of liberty..."", this true story is different in its authenticity. The drama, unlike a one hour TV show or 2 hour movie, unfolds slowly and over a period of time. Stay the course. As the the story unfolds, the same compulsion that propels the main characters absorbs you and motivates you to not put it down. Real true stories rarely have a perfect ""hollywood ending,"" and this story doesn't either. But real life it is, and interesting is an understatement."
5,"A gripping tale of discovery, courage, and friendship.","Ive seen Robert Kurson develop as a writer, so I was intrigued by his latest effort, Shadow Divers. His lofty reputation was certainly reflected in this masterful recount of the discovery of a German U-Boat just off the Jersey Shore. I care little about U-Boats, World War II, and diving, but I cared immensely about the heroes of this story, Chatterton and Kohler. Their courage, determination and compassion are great lessons for divers and landlubbers alike. Kurson's dominant theme of discovery transcends the physical into the spiritual and metaphysical, as his book transcends typical non-fiction into a work of art."
5,Exciting,"The most exciting read in long time. Passion, dedication, and experiences that changed lives. This is a great read for divers and non-divers alike."
4,"Informative, exciting.","Started slowly and developed slowly but then it had me. Not only a captivating read for the excitement of the story, but also very informative historically."
4,"If you like WWII mysteries solved, this one is for you","Although I didn't realize the ""lost treasure"" would be a German sub, it was interesting to hear about something I'd never do: scuba dive. Better yet is at the end of this book, the author interviews the 2 main divers; it gave yet a deeper insight into the men, with those voices easily defining their personalities.Arrived ahead of scheduled and as promised..yeah!"
4,A Fascinating Piece on a (Little Known) Activity,"I picked up this read on a business trip to San Antonio and finished it in three days. A quick read, with significant twists and turns. The author provides incredible insight on not only the lives / sacrifices of salvage / wreck divers, but on the men who manned the U2 boats during WWII. The research that was documented in the epilogue illustrates the extent to which the author went to verify the authenticity of the saga. Worth reading."
5,shadow divers,"my hobby is reading non-fiction adventure books, but this one is the mammoth of them all....so beautifully written that I felt every moment of elation at finding the sub, then fear, dread, and heartbreak in between, and finally joy at the confirmation of discovery. The author deserves a Pulitzer for this writing....His sensitive portrayal of the German crew connected the dots of a story to be remembered for the bravery of those men, and the determinaton and ""guts"" of Chatterton and Kohler. This is truly a story of a belief in oneself."
5,Shadow Divers,"A fantastic read, this book reveals how determined the divers were to discover which U-Boat they had discovered and the risks they took."
4,Couldn't put it down--and that's the problem!,"I wanted to read this book for several reasons--I live in New Jersey, I'm of German descent, and I've developed an appreciation for WWII history through being force-fed the Hitler Channel by my husband. I didn't expect the book to be terribly time-consuming, as I'm usually a fast reader. However, the detailed description sucked me in and slowed me down considerably.Finally, after I'd spent most of a day reading (when I really shouldn't have) toward the end of the book it was mentioned that Nova had done a documentary on the topic.If you have the time to savor the images your mind will conjure up... If you want to read about the divers' childhoods and marital problems... If you really want to know the gory details of how an alcoholic ship captain died... then read the book.If you just want the basics of the story, I recommend watching Nova's show on VHS (soon out on DVD), called Hitler's Lost Sub."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a great book, which I acquired along with The Last Attempt by Carlos Serra. The latest one is the story of freediving champion Audrey Mestre and what actually happened with her unsolved death. I'm quite happy with both books. Great reading although The Last Attempt is more gripping since it's based on a true story. Dramatic and shocking all the same."
4,Accessible Torpedo Tubes,"I prefer to read fiction, but force myself out of my mold a few times a year. Kurson's tone and pace is similar to 'A Perfect Storm.' Since most of us are not deep sea divers, let alone wreck divers, we have a lot of information we need to absorb before we submerge and anchor on the sub wreck. The details and history provided only flushed out the mystery of the wreck and never bored me. I'm not particularly interested in diving, subs or WWII history, but I thoroughly liked this book. How did I stumble across this book? Well I must admit I picked up Shadow Divers at the Museum of Science & Industry after touring the amazing exhibit of U-505. If you haven't been there since MSI rehabbed U-505 and put her in an underground exhibit, find an excuse to go. When you enter the main exhibit hall and you see U-505 literally lurking in a sea of grey concrete, you can just imagine U-who lying broken on the ocean floor hiding her identity in silt and anemones."
5,One of the best books I have read!,"This is an wonderful book, I couldn't put it down. If you like diving or just like a good read I highly recomend this book. It is well paced and takes the reader on a journey through the discovery of an unknow u-boat to the final conclusion of setting the record straight. I cant say enough things about this book, up there with ""into thin air"" another of my favorite reads. You must read this book! I promise you will love it!"
1,Warning: Spoiler,"This book would be excellent if it was classfied as fiction. Gary Gentile's ""Shadow Diver's Exposed"" shows the utter disregard for truth and literary accuracey. Gentile cites hard facts and research. Shadow Diver's is filled with drama and embellishment.I originally read the book and was captivated by it. It reads well and is a good story, but it is just that, a good story."
1,Sad,Yes they identified the U-Who. But they so embellished the rest of the story that another author needed to come out and expose it.
1,Unreadable,"I was eager to read this book and couldn't even finish reading it. The author goes on and on about very ordinary men with a dangerous hobby as if they are incredible heroes. Even the loser, alcoholic captain with no redeeming value is given the hero treatment. This constant drama about the divers with very uninteresting lives made the book impossible to read."
1,Diving book that lacks depth,"I bought this book expecting to read thrilling accounts of the search for this WWII submarine. What I found was an non-stop endless focus on the dangers of diving, some fascinating insight in to what drove these men to undertake such a dangerous adventure and page afer mind-numbing page of boring background details on the key players. Unfortunately,that makes for extremely slow reading, with little sizzle to keep the reader focused on the book. That also led to 356 pages (in my paperback version) that desperately need editing to keep the pace flowing. At times I was left wondering if the author was getting paid by the word."
4,Fun mystery!,This was a fast read and provided a peek into the life of deep sea diving. I would recommend to others!
4,Almost makes me want to strap on a bottle of trimix,"Yes, this is yet another in the seemingly endless genre of true-life adventure. Well, keep em coming, becuase this was a thoroughly enjoyable read. It introduced me to a whole world of amateur adventurer-explorers, one which I knew next to nothing about. The prose is a bit hyperbolic, but it's definitely an enjoyable, informative, highly readable story. It almost makes me want to strap on a bottle of trimix (a combination of oxygen, helium and nitrogen used by deep-sea divers) and go for a swim at 230 feet ... almost."
4,An Engrossing Read,"Shadow Divers is an engrossing read, one you'll find hard to put down. It tells the story of two men and their friends who devoted years of their lives to discover the truth about a sunken U-Boat off the coast of New Jersey. The story is compelling, interesting and well-written and, unlike many works like this, does not contain an outrageous number of filler and asides to make the story a book and not just an over long magazine piece. It's a quick read--a perfect beach read given the setting. The story it tells is fascinating."
5,The best adventure stories this year!,"Get ""Shadow Divers"" and ""The Bamboo Chest"" by Cork Graham you'll have two of the best true-life adventure stories of the year, if not the decade! These are books that can't be put down. For that matter, better get a few of each because you'll want to keep your copy and loan each of the others to friends and family who will be bugging you to loan your copies!"
5,"A bit sympathetic, perhaps?","Very good book. John Chatterton was overcome with madness and abandoned the principles that made him one of the world's premier divers in order to conclusively prove that the sunken U-boat was U-869. My only real problem with the book is the portayal of the men aboard the sunken U-869. Yes, they were kids and they knew the chances were slim to none that they'd ever return home alive but they would have gladly sunken as many US and British vessels that they possibly could. I cannot summon up any sympathy for those sailors without thinking about all the innocent people who perished due to the Nazi regime."
3,Shadowing anything?,"On the surface, the book is pretty good if you want to learn and even feel about how dangerous diving is. The narrative style is exactly what you expect in this kind of ""intending-to-be-best-seller"" book, but the dialogues are a little childlike (or the characters are).But when I finished the book remains the feeling that, in the deep, the author and the diver Kohler - this one probably a ""nationalsozialistoid"" - nourish sympathy for the Third Reich and tryed to establish a heroic and fighting spirit of those German soldiers - fanatical young people, accomplices of an inconceivable government in any developed country."
1,Save Your Money!,"The writing standard is excellent, however, it is the subject matter that torpedos this book. Too much is written about the very sad deaths of three divers, including a Father and Son team. Since the US Navy views 130 feet depth as the maximum safe depth for scuba diving, then to dive over 200 feet to a wrecked WW II relic is clearly very dangerous, even reckless. If you are interested in all the dangers of scuba diving, buy this book. If you are looking for a gripping WW II story, buy the excellent Nova DVD that Shadow Divers is based on:NOVA - Hitler's Lost SubOr, for those looking for a gripping man against the sea story:Adrift: Seventy-six Days Lost at Sea"
4,terms,"Shadow divers is a great read. Mr Kurson should have consulted a navy person on terms. He does not know the differencebetween a door and a hatch. A hatch goes between decks. A door is a door. He called the torpedo tube doors hatchesand the doors between the compartments hatches...Nay they are doors. Water tight doors between the compartments, andthe torpedo tubes have doors. which is strange because then he called the overhead ""ceiling"" , and the bulkheads wallsso he tried to be nautical with hatches but went civilian with the rest of the boat....but it still is a very very good book..."
4,a compilation of top guys' stories,"Bouscaren collected info from a number of sources and presented these for the reader to interpret. Sources from all sides of the issues on Vietnam. This is a great book for those of them whom have read only soldiers' accounts of vietnam and shy away from a one view political write up of the whole event.The fact that it was written in 77 (and I read it in 2000) shows that there were some people with a very good grasp of the situation in Vietnam at that time and that a retrospective look is very interesting.The book drives a point home: US foreign policy, it's manifest destiny took a hell of a blow and much will have to be done to redress the situation.This is a great book to read at this time (25 years after the fact), in combination with books on what US policy and the middle east regions are concerned from the 70's to now."
5,Jo Dee Messina Greatest Hits,Jo Dee Messina's Greatest Hits is an album that highlights this amazing womans career.It contains all her hits including her latest hit Was That My Life.A must have for any Jo Dee Fan
4,Would Have Rather Been Buying a new CD,"I'm kind of worried that Jo Dee's record label put out a Greatest Hits package and not a full-length new CD, it has been three years since Burn came out. ""Was That My Life"" is a great new song and the other three 'new' songs are good too, even though one of them is an older song that missed the cut for a previous CD. All of Jo Dee's songs are lots of fun to sing along with and the video for ""Bring on the Rain"" is also on the CD. This is a great CD for a new Messina fan, but I recommend getting all three of her CDs because the songs not included on this CD are just as good."
1,accidentally purasched don't like her music,Dislike brought by accident can't. Give a good review. I just don't. Liked her music and it was a total mistake.
1,just a thought,"don't you find it ironic that her greatest hits cd is only her fourth album. Not to say that she hasn't done some good songs, but this seems to be more of a marketing ploy by her record company than a Greatest hits album. When a third of what is on the album is new, it isn't a greatest hits. The songs on there are worth more than 1 star, but for trying to pull a fast one on the consumer, it only gets 1."
3,It's OK,I like it OK but it's certainly not my favorite album. Don't know what I was expecting but I guess this ain't it.
4,nice product and great price,"We purchased these booties and the separate mitts. They are white, not lavender as the picture shows. They are good size with velcro for the perfect fit. Keeps the heat in for a long time. You get 100 liners with this set, so it is a great deal."
5,A gripping history,"While as comprehensive and extraordinarily detailed as a college text, and as fully annotated, this is a great example of a 'popular' history at the top of its game. The enormous amount of (often grueling) material is nicely organized across time, place, and category, the many significant characters are well-delineated, and there is a sense of narrative flow and pretty steady momentum to this highly readable book."
3,too much charcoal dust,"I've had the Drinkwell pet fountain for a couple of years now and never had a problem with the filters. Now, with this latest purchase, the charcoal dust just keeps coming out. I always rinse them thoroughly before use but now, even after a good rinsing, a ring of charcoal collects in the bottom of the fountain bowl.I realize it isn't likely to hurt the cat, but it is annoying to have to clean it out. I don't know if there is a quality control problem or if they switched to a cheaper manufacturer because I never had this problem in the past. I checked filters from both of the 3-packs I bought and they both kept leeching charcoal the whole time they were in use."
5,Great item,Good quality for the price. I Would highly recommend this to anyone owning a Drinkwell Original Pet fountain. Each lasts up to 2 weeks.
2,not great and are they necessary?,I ordered the cat drinkwell fountain and after having it I felt the need to order replacement filters. But the directions on the fountain say you can run your fountain without the filters. But I thought- I should use the filters. The price for them on Amazon is a good value. But these filters even after I run them under running water before putting them into the fountain - still cause the water to turn black or there are black specs in the water. I don't think it's too healthy for my cats to drink the water when the filters are leaving black specs in the water or darkening the water. I have decided to just run water through my fountain- I use bottled water and clean it frequently. I don't think these filters do a whole lot except maybe force you to clean the fountain more than you normally need to.
4,Best I know of,2 Dogs and a cat share this bowl.... filter is a lifesaver. Filter kicks out a little charcoal when new unless you wash it off prior to installation. Highly recommend.
1,Do our pets really need these?,"I have used Drinkwell Pet Fountains for years. They're great. However, I never use the filters. Think about it, your dog or cat will lick their rear end and drink from a puddle outside. Do they really need water that has been filtered through activated carbon? I don't think so. This is a classic case of we humans thinking our pets are something more than they are.Save your money."
5,Works great with the big dog fountain!,We use these with our Drinkwell Big Dog Fountain. They work great! Love that I can get a three pack on Amazon MUCH MUCH cheaper than going to the local pet store!
3,okay but,"I bought the drinkwell for my cat and he does seem to like it better than a plain bowl. The fountain has filters. I used the filters that came with the bowl and everything seems okay. However, there was always black particles (like dust) in the bottom of the bowl. This required extra cleaning on my part. I tried to use the fountain without the filter but the bowl got slimey very quickly without the filter, so I ordered more filters and use them despite the black dust because it seems the black dust is better than slime."
4,"It works, but rinse first","So far i am changing my filters every 4 weeks as recommended to keep the water fresh, and i am washing the water fountain weekly. this does keep the water clean up please rinse it first, if you forget you need to wash everything and start over from all the charcoal dust"
4,Great product,"I have had the Drinkwell fountain for over a year now and am more than pleased with the whole system. The filters seem to do what is promised (I don't drink the water and my 2 dogs & 2 cats aren't talking - but they since they do drink from it, it must me OK!). The filters are easy to use, clean and change. I highly recommend the entire system."
5,Keeps the grime and mildew out,"I don't know how well the filter actually improves the taste of my cat's water, but I do know that the filter seems to trap the hair and some of the grime that somehow gets into the water. I find myself cleaning the Drinkwell less often because the filter keeps the water fresher for a longer period of time than without a filter."
5,Works fine.,"3 filters to a pack, easy to open (minimal) package (low waste), fit fine, work fine - everything as expected. They recommend replacing every month, but every other month works fine. :)"
4,Agree and disagree,"I completely agree with Mike Gunn's review. Why should animals need filtered water when they will also drink from puddles outside. However, after my initial filter became dirty and I threw it away, my cat would no longer drink from the fountain so I had to buy more filters. Once you spoil them, it's too late to stop now."
3,ok,"I am not sure how well these filters actually ""filter"". I ended up dumping the whole thing - too difficult to keep fresh. I don't like slippery water."
4,For Use With Fountain,"To encourage my cat to drink, I bought a new fountain. The filters were part of the deal. It is important for him to drink."
1,Terrible,It is nearly impossible to wash this down and clean it up. Even in the dishwasher there is so much standing water on the back side (either side up) that you'd have to wash it again by hand. Both my cats end up drinking from the well and that is where all the dirty water is. This unit is just stupid. There is lots of gurgling sound from the pump and the unit needs to be kept full of water.
4,needed for filtration,I like the filtration filters. They are easy to intall and they do work. That is what Ilike about the product. The price is what I don't like.
3,Not as good as the Platinum Drinkwell Replacements,I typically order the Platinum Filters but ordered these by mistakes. They are OK but expect to change more often if you usually order the Platinum filters. If you have a drinkwell fountain these filters are a must.
3,Does it's job,"These filters seem to work just fine, but I use bottled water in my pet fountain. Therefore, I can't really tell if it would change the taste of regular tap water."
5,My cat is happier,"Foxy is now about ten years old, and since I have been her person she has chosen to drink only from a faucet with running water. Only desperation would allow her to drink from a bowl! Since I bought the Drinkwell fountain she, apparently, is drinking far more than she ever did before, and she accepted the new fountain very quickly;I refused to turn on the bathroom faucet for her, thus she soon discovered her private ""spring"". She has become a happier, more playful and relaxed cat, so she probably wasn't drinking enough water before the Drinkwell came into her life.Her housemate doesn't use it, which is fine with her.The thought of cleaning this thing out every week was daunting, however I found it to be a snap. Ten minutes a week, tops. This is a good piece of equipment. Thank you."
3,Not sure how to rate a filter,I don't know when I'm suppose to change it as it looks the same weeks or even months later. I use filtered water so that probably helps to minimize filth building up on the filter
4,filters are OK...pet fountain isn't,These replacement filters came quickly and seem reasonably priced. I'm NOT a fan of this Drinkwell Pet Fountain and will not be getting another.
2,Manufacturing defect.,Ordered 2 pkgs of the drinkwell replacement filters and when I opened the first pkg one of the filters was open on one side and dumped charcoal crumbs all over the floor. I tried to save a few cents by ordering on line and got stung since now only 2 of the 3 filters in the pack are usable!
5,Charcoal keeps water fresh.,"Charcoal takes impurities out of the water so it only makes sense that if I don't want to or can't change the water every day, it needs a little help. I can't say I've tasted or tested the cats' water, but the filters look well made and fit well into the unit. My cats don't like days old stale water, but they drink this running water 5 days later, so I think it's doing the job - plus I don't need to leave the tap running for Mr. Finicky."
5,hard to find...,"these work great! my cats love their water again and drink more of it, too.texas water is hard and tasteless; this at least makes the water palatable and drinkable. the only gripe i have about them is that now that i have a drinkwell, the filters are hard as hell to find locally. now i have to go on the internet to find them. the best part of finding them on the internet? well, that has to be that they are actually cheaper!!"
5,works great and fast shipping,Fast shipping and the filters are how they should be. Nothing wrong with it. Thanks.
1,Junk!,"Avoid this product. The print server is incompatible with Canon printers (""except one"" according to tech support). Hawking does not publish a list of compatible printers. You simply have to wrestle with things until you are frustrated enough to call tech support who will inform you that the printer is not compatible. The configuration software is buggy, documentation is poor, and product testing seems thin. As an indicator, there are misspellings in the utility software. One dialog was title ""Warnning"". Junk!"
1,An Attractive Doorstop,"Does not work with my Canon i960, despite hours of configuration attempts. Following the instructions Tech Support emailed me three days after I reported the problem did not work. The Tech Support number provides access to a perpetual busy signal. Why won't Hawking Technologies simply publish the list of compatible printers?"
2,"Interface NOT User-Friendly, Inconsistent Performance","I didn't like the software interface provided, which I needed to use during set-up. The screens aren't intuitive enough, I had to waste time clicking around too much.Once it was set up and working, it didn't work consistently well. I have a Brother HL-1240 laser printer (parallel) and an Epson Stylus CX6400 (USB) connected to is and I get random trash characters showing up on my pages coming from the Brother laser printer."
2,Flaky,"I was first worried when I installed the unit and it required my to install and run some server management software on my local computer. To me, the whole point of a network print server is to get something that is standalone and autonomous. The product often hangs and requires a reboot (unplug and plug.) When it does choose to work it is much slower than my last print server. I am thinking about ditching this product and buying the Linksys EPSX3 which I wanted in the first place, except its much more expensive."
4,Not my favorite of Anderson's...bit still a good read.,"I absolutely love Catherine Anderson and although this will not be among my favorites of hers, it was still a good read, with strong characters. Tucker and Ellie Grant divorced after the death of their oldest son, whom each felt guilt and blame over the tragic accident that killed him. 3 years later, the two remaining sons, run away into the mountains refusing to come back until their parents get back together, forcing Tucker and Ellie to spend time together tracking the boys to the place where they used to camp as a family. All along the way, they fight their old feelings, and discover some unknown truths about each other and thier family.....This story has some highly emotional moments which is the strength of the book. Usually, I re-read all of Anderson's books at least once, but for some reason, this one didn't pack the punch for me that her other stories have in the past. Still a good read, and one that I would recommend."
5,Excellent Book,"I rarely review books, but could not let the opportunity pass to comment on ""Always in My Heart"". I read this book prior to reading any other reviews, and was surprised by the critical editorial review listed above.This is an excellent book with very well developed characters. Yes, a lot of the book is discussing the emotions of the main charachters, but that is what sets this book apart from many others.If you enjoy a book with more depth than ""fluff"", this is an excellent book to read. This was my first Catherine Anderson novel and since I have purchased several of her previous books.Enjoy!"
4,Good book but very sad,"I recommend this book but there are a few things the reader should know going in: it is very sad and though it is classified as a romance it is more about how a couple and a family goes on together after the death of a child. The way Tucker and Ellie find each other again and finally have conversations they should have had years earlier is pretty gripping and the reader's emotions are caught very early on in the book. It is well written and well paced. But don't expect a light romance, and have tissues handy, as it's a real tear-jerker. There are things which get resolved a little too easily but hey, it's fiction! In all, this story holds together very very well and is worth the time, but do not expect to feel light-hearted when you've turned the last page. There is a HEA but it is still bittersweet at best."
1,always in my heart,I'm very disappointed that I'm not able to get this title on my kindle!! I love all her books and have so looked foward to reading this one.
3,Confusion,"Out of the 6 books from the serious I'd put this one at number 4 out of 6. I loved the attraction and chemistry between Ellie and Tucker. I still do not quite understand why they split instead of working things out but oh well. The MOST confusion part of this serious is I never know when this book took place. It was the third one written in this serious but through out the other books their kids and they are never mentioned together. They have been together forever but what happened between then. This book had to have taken place after ""My Sunshine,"" because in the very end it mentions how Tucker is still single. Something happened in between because in that book Tucker is 34 and his a few years older in this one. The only part I DON'T understand is why their 2 kids never visited grandma and grandpa after their parents split. I DO recommend people to read this and tell me what happened or what I missed. Also recommending the rest of the Coulter/Kendrick series."
4,A useful reference for HPLC method development,"This is the first book I take off the shelf when I need to develop a method. When I stumbled on a resolution problem and decided to switch to an ion exchange method, I read the section covering the subject and without any difficulty had my problem solved. There was enough detail to help me get the method up and running in a couple of days. I only wish it was available on the Kindle."
4,For whom Bell tolls,"Author Madison Smartt Bell has more than proven himself in the literary world. But music? Can he pull it off, or should he be politely - but firmly - reminded to stick to his first profession? Answer -- He does pull it off, and in spades. ""Forty Words for Fear"" is full of brooding, quirky late night music that comes over as a sort of cross between Leonard Cohen and James McMurtry with a slight Southern Gothic vibe. Produced with contemporary legend Don Dixon and featuring a host of nifty instrumental touches, Forty Words is the perfect soundtrack for your next clandestine meeting at your favorite dive down the street.Oh, and to the two previous reviewers -- Why post a 1-star review if you haven't even heard the CD? And doesn't your computer run Real Player? I had no trouble listening to samples (although I already own the CD)."
3,Slide Storage,Bought the single box thinking it was the complete system ( I should have known better by the price) The description is misleading I feel. So now I have 1 box that cost $15 to store 360 slides.There are no instructions or pictures that show how to use the index tabs (It really shouldn't require instructions but in this case it does)I feel like a dope not knowing what to do with the tabs since they don't fit in any direction. In addition what's with the slits on the inner box are they there for a reason?I guess If you just want a box for storage it fills the need.
3,Not all bad...,"I always said I wasnt' gonna be the parent that packed a bag of toys and snacks to get my kids to sit thru church service, but that was long before I had 4 kids 4 and younger. I still don't want them to have any ol' thing when I want them to start learning about faith and church, so we've looked around for some religous options. Other than books it's very slim pickins (and I don't want my kids sitting there with books saying ""read this momma"", ""what does this say momma?), so we bought one of these for our four year old son as his ""church toy"" and he LOVES it. Yes, it's cheaply made (the paint is slapped on very poorly), but it seems to be a pretty sturdy piece of plastic that I'm not worried about falling apart, and come on it's Jesus!"
2,Not a Good Toy.,"For an action figure that is supposed to be a resemblance of the Son of God, this toy is lame. Granted, it's kind of cool to have a toy Jesus, but it's not a very good toy. Other than his arms, the figure has no flexibilty whatsoever: his legs are permanently hidden beneath a robe of hard plastic and his head is fixed in a frozen forward gaze. Even though his arms can move, they are only capable of forward and backward motion. Finally, the gliding action feature of the toy (meaning little wheels on the figure's base) is more of an annoyance than anything else. The toy has a coolness factor of a ten (It's Jesus, man), but as a toy it resembles something a kid can get out of one of those claw games."
3,Crazy,"I wasn't sure what to make of this. Should children play with Jesus in the role of action figure? There seems to be something not quite right about finding Him in the bottom of the toy box. I did however, buy it as a gift for an adult..thought they would think it funny."
3,Jesus action figure,"This piece is different. I thought it was going to look better than it did. The paint on it seemed smudged and it looked like what ever painted it couldn't stay in the lines. It does roll okay and my smaller cousin likes it, she is 4, but my older one just looks at it funny. I say for younger kids, not too young of course it is nice and they will probably enjoy it since kids don't normally look at how detailed something is or how well the paint is done on a toy, but for older kids, the box has some good stuff on it, educational, but other than that, they won't think it is too cool. If it looked a little better over all, I think they would think it is cool but not the way it is."
3,Bad packaging,It arrived quick. Bad packaging opened. Bought this for no reason. Maybe to add a gun but sucks. Doest move much just roles. So ill blow it up or send it flying or shoot it . Upset
3,episodes for this,"1.the passing of the hat. we learn about luffys past with shanks his hat and the gum gum fruit.2.the circus comes to town. we meat nami , buggy, his crew and the mayer,3.the beast breaker. luffy meats the town dog shu shu and luffy faces off against buggys fist mate moje and his oversized lion richi the beast breaker."
5,Great product,Although the item shipped was the wrong color - I thought we were getting white and it turned out to be oak - the shelf is great and holds the DVD and cable box. Easy to install and very sturdy. Excellent product and quick delivery.
1,Trash,This shelve came with the front piece broken off and missing still wrapped in the original plastic. They had to know it was broke before sent. After a couple of rude emails they said to trash it and would credit my account. To my knowledge this has still not been done. They did say it would take 10 days. Only took one to charge it.
5,A wonderful collection!,"This is a lovely, reminiscent collection of music by Guy Lombardo. I purchased this to relive the music my grandmother played many years ago and found the recordings to be clear and true to their intended original sound. The inside jacket cover includes an enjoyable overview of Mr Lombardo's life and musical talents. A real listening pleasure!"
2,Alright,I didnt like this cd at all. I guess it was cool but i dont listen to it anymore. The beats and singing sucks.
2,marine speaker,"I was looking for an all-weather speaker upgrade for my new pontoon boat. The housings are very well built. The speaker quality is junk. They sound very tinny, and carry almost no bass. I am going to try to adapt other speakers to the housings (more expense) because they sound pitiful."
2,paralyzed from waist down,"The figurine is realistic and the paint is the same as the TV character. It gets two stars because the figurine can't move anything from the waist down and the arms move together, so if you move one arm the other arm moves too. Nice to look at on a shelf, not so great for play."
5,The war years,A compelling and truthful story about the trying and difficult times during the second world war. The book is truthful about the trying times but has a lot of drama and romance. If you are looking for a book for great reading you dont want to miss this one! The author of This Old House has come through again!
5,A one-of-a-kind parenting book!,"As a parent of a four and six year old, I must say this book is certainly a new approach to writing about the well-being of children. As a first grade teacher, I did a mini-workshop for my parents using the quality info in this book. My sister-in-law received this book as a baby shower gift and she said my brother ""eats, sleeps, and drinks it""! I think the most captivating component of the book is the approach to the whole child with the focus being on strengthening the family. It is not a do's and don'ts book on the extrinsic parts of a child, but concentrates on the intrinsic aspects as well. You must complete your parenting library with this book! That's why I came to Amazon.com!"
3,Ani Digi,This is a nice watch overall. It was disappointing to see that it had no light and the digital numbers are a bit too small to read. I love the look and it feels great.
3,Observation of the Earth and Its Environment: Survey of Missions and Sensors,It is a very comprehensive review on technology and sensors exploited in the field. Personally I think it's a bit lacking in the analysis of methodologies used to extract relevant information from sensors' measures.
5,So Musical,"Though I'm no authority on guitar music, I do have two recordings of the Villa-Lobos preludes included on this disk. Bream's playing here beats the other recording hands-down. It has a quality of elegance and yet of fun that I've called in this review's title simply ""musical."" And that's what we listen to music for, isn't it? I truly love those pieces and this CD."
4,Very Good Fixx,"""Phantoms"" was released in 1984, following The Fixx's hugely successful album ""Reach the Beach."" This album is moderately hard to find, so if you are a fan of The Fixx and you can get it, I would suggest picking it up. Some of The Fixx's best songs are on this album. ""Sunshine in the Shade"" was a minor hit, but there are much better songs on this album that were never played on the radio.All of The Fixx's albums are consistently great. Many rock bands have widely varying levels of quality among their albums, but The Fixx seemed to find their trademark atmospheric guitar-and-synth sound right off the bat, and they play it well through all their albums. I have every album in the Fixx's catalog, and they are all wonderful. Very good album!"
3,Brilliant moments but harbingers of schlock to come,"Lose Face, Less Cites, Sunshine in the Shade, and Are We Ourselves are as exciting as the band's earlier work. However, songs such as Facing the Wind, I Will, Wish, and Question demonstrate a tendency to an adult contemporary sound. Cy Curnin's lack of vocal range ads to the tedium on slower numbers. I still recommend ""Phantoms"" for the aforementioned songs that measure up to ""Shuttered Room"" and ""Reach the Beach."" Like Talk Talk, The Fixx seemed to want to get out from under the thumb of the pop sounds that made them successful in the first place. And like Talk Talk, when The Fixx forged a new sound, it turned out to be languid and lacking in focus."
4,Great remastering and bonus tracks to boot.,"This one has been out of print for a long time, but is now faithfully resurrected by One Way. The remastering sounds great, and there's bonus tracks to boot: extended versions of ""I Will,"" ""Less Cities,"" and a live version of ""Sunshine In The Shade."" If you own the original CD of this, sell it off and buy this reissue, it sounds so much better. Personally, my favorite album by the band is ""Reach The Beach,"" but this is a close second. Legend has it that the label rushed the band back into the studio to get another album out, after the wild success of ""Reach The Beach."" It is evident on this disc, but the band is so strong you barely notice it. This is still an essential album for your collection of quality 1980's rock."
1,very misleading track list,"i thought that $6 was low for a disc of 30 tracks. so i looked at the reviews. one reviewer was wowed at the collection, so i added it to my cart. obviously that reviewer never played this disc. this disc only has 4 tracks!he must get credit for writing reviews.buyer be warned about reviewers with 1000 reviews to thier credit. it was only a $6 loss for me, but I will be more carefull in future with review-addicts like David Kenner."
4,Collin Raye at his best!,"My wife & I are big Collin Raye fans. He's one of the best country singers today. This concert is wonderful but be warned. About half of the songs are shortened. Some are just 1 verse & the chorus. I'm not sure whose idea this was. We would have gladly paid extra for a 2 DVD set to get the full versions of the songs or less tracks on 1 disc, but full versions. This has 26 tracks plus bonus material on 1 disc. His comments on the music industry are so true. This DVD is definitely worth the money & we highly recommend it!"
1,HORRID PLOT,"This was the worst time-travel romance I have ever read in my life! The author gives clues early on as to what may happen, which would be good, and they don't. Throughout the book the plot does not seem well thought out and the story does not flow. There were noticeable grammatical and syntax errors, and the author is always writing about things that ""had"" happened, rather than speaking in plain past tense. I do not know why I finished reading this book, but when I did, the ending did not seem pulled together, the book seemed lacking from character development. The hero of the book brooded about something the entire book that was explained in one sentence in the end, the heroin was depressed in the last half of the book. Not how I like a heroin to be. Don't waste your time reading this book. It isn't worth your time."
1,Wish I could honestly say the same....,"For me, this is a slow moving depressing book. I just don't see what these other reviewers see. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
4,Not for beginners . . .,"I had been taking yoga for three months before trying Power Strength Yoga for Beginners; I have to say I do not recommend this tape for individuals who have had no instruction in Yoga. I think you need at least a few weeks experience before practicing Yoga with this tape.Rodney leads a series of Sun Salutations without much prompting on what will position will come next which is why I recommend watching this video in its entirety before doing the moves along with Rodney. None of the positions are too difficult for a beginner.I dislike that the Living Arts includes so much promotional materials or advertisements on their videos--it is distracting.If you are looking for an instructional yoga that really is for beginners (those who know nothing about yoga), I recommend Yoga Journals: Yoga Practice for Beginners with Patricia Walden for a thorough, complete, and slow explanation of each Yoga pose."
4,An Excellent and Physically Challenging Workout,"This is one of my favorite yoga videos. I love Rodney Yee and in this video he delivers a vigorous yoga workout. I'm not sure why the tape has the word beginners in the title, because it is not for anyone just beginning yoga practice. Maybe it was intended to be a beginning strength video for those already practicing yoga. I am still working on mastering the arm balances at the end of the session, but I'm slowly getting there. I recommend this video for anyone looking for a challenging yoga practice."
2,What the???,"I had never done yoga, however hearing so much about it, I decided to go for a test run... I purchased this video and popped it into the VCR excited. Cleared furniture, turned the tv on and stood there in shock with my mouth hanging open! The man never says, this is how you do this...get into position like this...NOTHING! He throws himself around like its no big deal, there's NO WAY a beginner could do anything as fast as he's doing it or with ease. The only thing nice about it is the view of the beach and the tight shorts he has on..."
2,Definitely Not For Beginners,"I have done yoga on and off for 30 years, so I know beginners poses and many of Rodney Yee's asanas are NOT for beginners. I did not find this relaxing at all, and found myself just staring at the TV with my mouth hanging open in shock from some of the poses he does on this tape. Borrow one if you can before buying this tape if you're a real beginner -- or buy mine from me!"
3,Too fast to concentrate,"I've been doing various types of Yoga for about 4 years now. I know most of the poses and decided to get the power yoga video because I hadn't ""officially"" tried power yoga yet. I don't know how this could be considered a beginners video. I knew how to do the poses by name and had a difficult time keeping up with him. I'm not sure what you are supposed to get out of this tape. The moves are so quick that it is difficult to keep up. It almost impossible to challenge yourself because by the time you get into a pose, he has already moved on. I've tried it a few times but haven't gotten past the sun salutations because he gets so far ahead of me I give up. There is too much advertisement/ talking in the beginning. I would recommend looking for another video."
3,Sequences good but too fast,"Mr. Yee doesn't hold many movements for more than a breath or two ... to fast for a power yoga routine ... it would have been nice if he had really held the movements ... the movements themselves are nice, but better to do without watching the tape ... also the backdrop wasn't as nice and clean as Mr. Yee's other videos and a bit distracting"
4,Great album...it brought me right back to college.,"When listening to this cd, I can vividly recall jumping sweatily next to several hundred (at least?) other drunken college students. Oh the days of yore. This album will make you thirst for Schmidt in the middle of the afternoon."
4,Excellent Core Ska Band,"Saw the Crazy 8's play several times in my hometown of Vancouver, BC. The used to get The Town Pump literally jumping. Just a crazy scene in the club. I also remember seeing them at The Railway Club where they were crammed onto the SMALL stage there and went off.Such a great horn section, such fun music and such evocation of great memories. If you like ska and want to hear some core, roots music in that genre this a great album. It's hard not to give in to sentimentality and give it 5 stars but they were always best live.Miss these guys tons!"
5,Big Live Nut Pack,"Saw the band three times, loved every song. Looking for a good ska band; you have found it. A must have for the serious fan."
4,Excellent everyday and under exercise shorts underwear,"I have some discontinued, polyester compression shorts by Champion that I really appreciate for the support and how they prevent chafing my legs.In the past few years I've increased the time I exercise and with more muscle, boxer brief legs are just too short even for underwear, and compression shorts are, in my view priced too high. These briefs do very well, and are lighter. I've used them for a few weeks. I will add to the review after a few months. Right now four stars seems right."
5,Comfort is king.,"I have tried briefs, boxers, and these midway with fly underwear. No contest, these beat the others for comfort. They are great when walking or running."
5,Great things Come in Small packages..,"Exactly what I needed for School and got it for a much more reasonable cost then on campus or through the regular ordering routes. It came in the condition stated..This book may be small and at first glance one might think, ""Really, This is a college text book?"" But don't be fooled by it's wee size, as it is packed full of useful information about writing effectively. This is a great reference book that isn't cluttered with a lot of wordy explanations. Direct and to the point!I'm using Amazon.com to get all of my college books from now on!!THANK YOU AMAZON.COM!!!!"
3,Disappointed,"I was terribly disappointed that the CDs do not include the phrase in English. You have to have the book in front of you or you will not know what is being said. Not good for listening while exercising or driving. Also, the phrases come pretty rapidly, not enough time to do a careful pronunciation and absorb the meaning.For the serious student who wants to sit down and learn to read and write Bengali as well as speak it, it is a good textbook."
2,What Songs?,"I used to collect CD singles, but recently I realized that its all a scam for the group to make money and not worth the price. I mean I can see paying 13 dollars for let's say five songs, but this CD only has 3 songs on it, one of them is already on the original, so about the songs, song two is five minutes and is mediocre----I just had an epiphany, I realized that these songs artists put on singles are in fact ones that they have cut from the original releases because they weren't good enough to put on the release, so what do they do with them? Charge 6 dollars a song and sell them as imports, who pays six dollars a song? It must be one hell of a song, anywayz this cd is not worth the money, unless you really really are a collector. Oh and song 3, the remix is not really a remix, if it is then I can't hear the difference."
2,Too much technical and too little How to,"If you know all the techie stuff, you will probably enjoy this book. But, if you are starting out Antony can leave you shaking your head.For example, I needed to know about Key framing. I read his section where he discusses Interpolation, Auto Bezier, Continuous Bezier followed by Spatial Interpolation and Temporal Interpolation methods. He sure knows his stuff -- but after reading it carefully, my head is hurting and I still have no idea how to do some simple animation in my movie.I understand that Premiere Elements 2 In a Snap is probably more suitable for me -- and for you if you have trouble with books that focus on concept over How To."
4,Great Rotors.,These have made a big difference in stopping power. Eliminated all the shimming I had in the steering wheel while braking. Very smooth and the coating will help prevent rust.
5,Best Birthing Book I've Found!,"I was seeking as natural a childbirth as possible that also covered possible medical complications. This book maintains a positive focus on the natural while also being realistic about potential problems and non-natural necessities. Gill encourages a healthy attitude toward birth that is not unrealistic. It is the most beautiful, positive book I've found and I wouldn't trade it in for the world!"
5,Totally awesome,Who say that it's not a good DVD is just because don't really know about good Brazilian music. Considering what we have now a days in terms of good brazilian music it's between the best. I totally recomend it!
1,WHAT A DISASTER!,"I bought this CD in order of listening to something from Brazil. This is the worst thing I've ever listened in my life. And the bad thing is one information I had from friends of mine in Brazil, Both Ana and Seu Jorge have avoided to say during shows that the song ""É isso ai"" it's just a version (I GUESS COMPOSED BY AN ARTIST CALLED DAMIEN RICE), as if they were the composers, this is the worst thing one artist could do. They said that ""DURING A TV PROGRAM CALLED ""ALTAS HORAS"", WHILE ANA WAS SINGING THIS SONG, APPEARED BELOW ON TV, THEIR NAMES, AS COMPOSERS. WHAT IS THAT, THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THING TO DO, SIMPLY DON'T BUY IT, IT'S A DISASTER!BUY TOM JOBIM THE MASTER FROM BRAZIL."
3,An okay read,"I really enjoyed Debbie's Hard Luck, Alaska series, so I was really looking forward to this new one about Scott O'Halloran. But to be honest, I was disappointed. The book was not that good. The love story between Scott and Chrissy was just not that interesting. I liked hearing about what had happened to the other characters in Hard Luck, but the main plot just didn't turn out well. I think she gave into him much too easily. He barely had to work for her love. But that is my opinion. You might just want to read this book to find out about the other characters."
5,Great Story by Janice Kay Johnson,I have reread Janice Kay Johnson's story Promise Me Picket Fences over and over again. It is worth the price of this collection. The other two stories have major problems as far as I'm concerned. But Picket Fences was complete with a too-die-for hero and an endearing heroine. I enjoyed the story as well as the romance. Buy Born in a Small Town today! Janice Kay Johnson's story is lovely and makes it all worthwhile.
2,Falls Short,"Debbie MacComber's short story was lacking compared to the rest of the Midnight Son's series. It was nice to hear what happened to the rest of our favorite characters from the other books (in fact it was more interesting than the Scott/Chrissie main plot). I didn't buy Scott's ""troubled teenager"" character at all because of who MacComber painted him to be in the earlier books. Scott would have talked things out with his family instead of internalizing and running away.The other two stories were good reads especially Promise Me Picket Fences but I felt that the stories moved too quickly and didn't develop characters. For example, I would have liked to learn more about Angie and about Hannah's sister Emily (who sounds more interesting than Hannah herself)."
3,3 books in 1,"I asked for this book for my birtday, because I had read the previous six books over the summer that proceeded the first story in this book. This story was a good follow up to those books. A quick read. I enjoy Debbie Macomber, and that is the only reason I got this book. I couldn't get ""into"" the other two stories, however, and moved on to better books!"
2,Disappointed,"Midnight Sons and Daughters seemed like they just cut the story short. It felt like they got to the middle of the book (which was good up until that point)then decided to end the story. They spent too much time explaining the back story. I had not read the others in the series, therefore the info didn't mean much to me. However if I had read the other books, then I wouldn't have needed all the back story. It would have been better to have more of their story than to get into all of the back story about the other characters.The Glory Girl was a decent read, but I wish there would have been more finality to the story.Promise Me Picket Fences was definitely the best story in the book, good storyline and you didn't feel like the ending left you hanging about the outcome of the story."
5,Small Town Girl,"I read all Debbie Macomber's books and this one didn't disappoint. i grew up in a small town and so much of this story was true, everybody knows your business."
4,Would recommend,"Held my interest, even after reading a few chapters at a time.Would recommend to anyone that likes romance novels."
3,Typical Macomber read,I like her books because they're entertaining and an easy read. I know the story is always going to work out OK.
4,"Excellent album, clearly their best to date","It is easy to understand why the White Stripes gained much of their early popularity across the pond. If you're not familiar with either of their first two albums, think Robert Plant meets Cream. Hence, ""De Stijl"" is raw, edgy and soulful. Tracks ""Hello Operator"" and ""Jumble, Jumble"" are reminiscent of late 60's rock and roll, while ""I'm Bound to Pack it Up"" and ""Truth Doesn't Make a Noise"" are best described as bluesy ballads. This amalgamation of rock and blues makes ""De Stijil"" a truly enjoyable listening experience."
4,Rock 'n' Blues,"The White Stripes storm into this album with all the blues and rock that any band could wish for. In the same way that the early Rolling Stones were influenced by the blues, you can see the connection here.That said, this rocks out as much as the early Rolling Stones music does too. In fact, I believe The White Stripes are part of a movement (along with Jet, the Strokes, the Hives, etc.) that is trying to bring rock back to its roots--that is, back to the blues."
3,"DeStijl, De Stijl, but where's Da Skill?","This CD is good enough to merit a listen or two but De Stijl means stripped down, not incapable. Shedding the fat in rock is good sense in my book but a modicum of ability would be nice. I'm not asking for virtuoso drumming but I can only take bass-snare-snare for so long, Mrs. White.However, just because I desire a bit more skill and could do without ""Apple Blossom"" and prefer Son House's ""Death Letter Blues"", doesn't mean this sucks.I appreciate Jack's interests in old blues and heartily approve of physical violence against The Von Bondies. So as far as I'm concerned this merits a purchase but not extened play nor adulation."
2,Conspiracy of two,"They may be superstars now, but these meek losers got their start playing carwash gigs in a Detroit suburb that specializes in cheap subs and dirty mags. Kate Ryan started out as the bassist, but soon gave it up because - surprise, surprise! - she couldn't play. She switched to the drums which she continues to play even worse, and the history of White Stripes began.Not much to say of this album. The bass is too punchy sounding, the vocals are stretched thin, and the drums, well, the drums are just the drums. Don't believe the hype of this strange 2-group combo - they're really metal lovers at heart, and only became alternative when it became hip to do so after Headbangers Ball faded into oblivion.Long live r & r."
1,"DON""T BELIEVE THE HYPE","This band has gotten a lot of attention and acclaim recently for being the ultimate ultra-stipped down blues stomp - don't believe it. Some of the blues stuff on here is OK, but there is quite a few fey pop songs on here that are a real drag. The biggest bummer of all, however, is the singer's habit of breaking into Robert Plant impersonations from time to time. If it's raw modern bluesy raunch you're after I'd suggest starting with a Gories album. Pass on this."
1,Wow,"What is this, I just don't get it, please explain. Eveyone told me how great this album is, what a waste. I guess I am no longer with it."
5,No words strong enough to describe it...,"This is probably the best album I have bought all year. After buying the album ""White Blood Cells"", I was hooked to their sound, and I have bought this one only to discover that they are even greater than I thought. The sharp sound of the guitar and the simplistic beats of the drums are just perfectly fitting together. Their music is sort of a mix of blues and mid-sixties rock, a cross between the doors and the velvet underground, with a bit of the beatles. I can't tell you how happy I am that I own this album."
5,White Stripes Rock!!!,"Music Just doesn't get any better than this. Now, all white stripes albums are good, but this one is just to good. If you buy it, skip to track 2 ""hello operator"" Then go to track 11 ""jumble jumble"". Then listen to them all. I also recomend white blood cells and elephant. ROCK ON WHITE STRIPES!!!!"
4,Garage Rock at its best,"De Stilj combines blues and rock practically flawlessly on this album. Jacks slide guitar shows that he has a great knowledge of blues guitar. His playing really shines on ""Death Letter"" a cover of the blues classic by Son House.This album is rock and Roll in its dirtiest most primitive form, and that's exactly the way it should be. Meg White keeps her drumming simple but, effective and Jack Whites whinny but, soulful voice fits right in.The White Stripes have resurected Rock and Roll and have scoffed at the idea of overdubbed .... They have kept it simple."
1,The White Stripes,"Forget it, the people that said this album is good are either family or friends of the artists (if you wanna call them that). This album is horrible. If you want something similiar and at half the price write me an email and I will run a nail across a CD and sell it to you for 5 dollars. They should change their name to ""Brown Stripes""...you know the ones you find in your underwear....nuff said!"
4,Motor City Rocks the World!,"These two Detroiters have it going on. Jack White's talent is amazing. They put out in ""De Stijl"" in 2000 and it is great. They are a simple group but that is what I like most about them. No digital voices, no over-produced sound, no artificial ultra-glam looks. They look like two people who happen to live in your neighborhood that play music. This CD I want to listen to all day and I wish nothing but success for these two."
2,Gimme a Break!,I dont get it. This isnt new or inventive or even good garage rock n roll. Ill take the real Dexter Romweber if you dont mind. If anyone reads this and they want to hear the originator of the raw garage Duo thing...go get the Dexter Romweber CD called Chased by Martians or even The CD called Safari by The Flat Duo Jets...you wont regret it!
4,Worth checking out,"Living in Detroit I've seen Jack & Meg live a bunch of times. De Stijl is my favorite of their albums. The Stripes are raw, austere, and unpolished. Still, there is something strangely compelling about their music. Maybe I'm a little biased though, because they are from Detroit..."
4,Fun...,"The White Stripes aren't going to shock you with a grand artistic statement like ""Stairway to Heaven"". This is fun, simple (the key word for this album) music. Many people compare them to the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club - this music is not nearly as intricate or well thought out. Rather, the Stripes sound like BRMC when they were 12 and playing in their parents basement.Despite the simplicity, the Stripes manage to pile on catchy song on top of catchy song to make a unique thing - a very poppy, immediately accessible indie album. Particularly good are ""Truth Doesn't Make a Noise"", and ""I'm Bound to Pack It Up"". Also, the ""drum solo"" on Hello Operator is priceless."
2,Can you spell OVERRATED?!?!?,"Oh how I've tried. Jack White is supposed to be the reincarnation of...well, somebody important in music. I've listened to the White Stripes. I've listened to his solo stuff. I've listened to the Raconteurs. I don't get it. The songs are mediocre and the production is often weak. I know, the rabid fans will come to his defense. There was a guy who wrote a review on the Raconteurs who dissed Brendan Benson while praising White's efforts. While I agree Benson doesn't fit into the Raconteurs, he has more songwriting talent in his little finger than White will ever have. De Stijl may be some people's cup of tea, but I can't in any way see how it could be considered a classic. ""But it's done with just guitar and bass, man!!!""... Yeah. Maybe that's the problem..."
3,De Stijl,"I bought this cd at the same time I bought their cd titled ""White Stripes"". I think they struggled a bit on this album to come up with a new sound. And while I like this album I do not rate it as highly as White Stripes. My interest in the duo is still intact and I will be purchasing more of their music."
5,Really Great CD!!!,"This CD is great. I first heard it from my dad, and then i became a White Stripes fan. It is good for pretty much anyone that likes kinda blues and rock."
3,De Stijl,"A good early album from a band I love, but one that was missing from my collection. First half of the album is very good. Sound is somewhat minimalistic if you have been following their evolution over time and are hearing this one for the first time. It's definitely worth the $8 I paid for it."
2,Cheap Watch,Very cheap watch. Broke after about three months of use. I loved the fact that it was digital but I wish it was put into with a little more care. Fix the bands on the sides and maybe send some replacement parts in case some break.
2,Not as expected,"This was more of a counseling session than a comedy DVD. Love the comedy, will pay for a therapist is needed."
5,It ministers to the heart.,"Jeff has grown since I last viewed one of his videos. He is funny, and you will laugh, but adding their marriage testimony has given this video a dimension that is sure to minister to others that are going through a similar situation. It is poignant and real."
4,"Bit slow to start, but well worth it","A friend gave me this DVD. I always am a bit skeptical when I am given a DVD/book/game, etc. So, this sat around the house for a while. One evening when the family was looking for something new to watch, we decided to throw it in. The first couple minutes weren't too funny, I thought we had made a mistake. But Jeff picked it up as he went along, and before long we were laughing until our sides hurt. It really was great stuff. Funny, clean, and if you are married with kids, very close to home.One small caveat. At the end of the DVD Jeff and his wife share their personal story. It is heart-wrenching and gripping, but definitely not amusing. It was unexpected, coming at the tail end of such a funny routine. But, if you can change gears, it is a powerful testimony."
4,A horror and science- fiction novel!,This Jermey Brett Sherlock Holmes story is a little stupid! The ending is kind of interesting but this is a creepy film. An ape appears on a woman's window and she goes to Sherlock Holmes to find out what's going on. This is definately a science- fiction film!
2,Creeping Man,"Where do I begin in explaining this story?!?! oh, i know. it was the dumbest book man kind has ever written. But i'm 15, so what would i know? not a lot right? well i do know when i like something...and this i do not like. but if your a science geek and you like science fiction then this just may be the book for you!!!!!!!!!!"

3,HALF & HALF,"It's thrilling to have Reger's beautiful Clarinet Quintet, Op. 146 on a budget Naxos CD--- Fuchs and the Berliners do quite an excellent job: warm, heartfelt, sincere.The only fly in the ointment is the String Quartet, Op. 109, which is quite heavy weather: thick in texture, dense in harmony, lots of bluster with a minimum amount of substance. The promise of revelation never comes, not even repeated listenings. Poor Max!However, as far as I can see, the Clarinet Quintet, all too rare on CD, anyway, is worth the budget outlay. (The only alternative, I believe, is a full-priced CD, same coupling, with Karl Leister.) When one speaks of clarinet quintets, there are, of course, the monuments: Brahms and Mozart. Less monumental is the Weber. Reger stands next to Brahms, easily (and stylistically), if not as strongly or deeply, but is still well worth acquiring, regardless.Good, clear sound.[Running time: 73:36]"
4,a great one,Nina Simone is one of the best jazz/blues singers ever recorded. she brings a 1940's tone to 1960' songs. she is deep in tone and in thought.
4,Excellent drama documentary,"This is a very well crafted drama, interspersed with real footage and occasional interviews. The acting is top notch, the writing is excellent (as is to be expected from John Hopkins) and it neatly shows the steps that led to the dropping of the atomic bomb - a form of paranoia on both sides that is perhaps inevitable after so many years of war. It's quite a sympathetic view of both sides - looking at both the US and Japanese povs - perhaps too sympathetic - who can say? Either way, it's a great piece of drama."
3,Dry but detailed account of events,"The flavor is more of a docudrama than a theatrical drama. The subject is a difficult one so it must be hard to write a script for; but so would 'Pearl' or 'Saving private Ryan' which have the flare and personal interest infused that Hiroshima does not. Nonetheless if you are looking for a movie that teaches history in the classroom, this would be a good vehicle."
4,Unbelievable returns,"I first heard Joel Cassaway over ten years ago in Orlando when he was a lecturer and investment trainer for a popular real estate seminar company. Joel packs a lot of information, is fun to listen to too and a excellent trainer.Joel discussed discounted mortgages. I followed his advice and netted a 150% return!What more can I say? This guy knows his stuff."

5,HELP!,"THE BOOK IS A MASTERPIECE ,BUT REIKI INFORMATION IS TO BADLY NEEDED TO KEEP THE METHODS ARJAVA FOUND FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN ATTENED THE CLASSES.I REALY WANT TO LEARN THE METHODS SO I CAN TRULY BE A WELL ROUNDED REIKI STUDENT."
1,USUI kept part of buddha teachings and built a new system,"Hello, i am a tibetan lama practising ReiKi ( transmissions FREE ) in Luxembourg ( Europe ) FAPetter book is good for it gives Usui postures for healing. FAPetter and Lama Yeshe have opposition on Mikao Usui sources : Heart Sutra or Lightning Flash Tantra ? In fact, i think both are true but if you really want to understant how ReiKi does to heal and what is the meaning of symbols : learn Kalaakra tradition. All ReiKi is explained in it and symbols are japaneese deformations of sanscrit letters joined with 4 akras of navel, heart, throat and front as that HRI : Amida-Amitabha, HOUNG : Kannon-Avalokiteshwara, AH : Bishamon-ten/Vaishravana, OM : Mao-son/Mahathamaprapta. All thesse bla-bla about ReiKi and all litterature of New Age are REALLY REALLY stupid ! Please don't be silly, learn Buddhism with budhist masters ...Tashi delek. Lama Kunzang, Luxbg"
4,Heartfelt beginning to a movement of reclaiming Reiki's origins,"This is a nice little book for anyone new to Reiki. Although informed by having lived in Japan, while teaching and researching Reiki, Petter most definitely has written a book about Western Reiki. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, and we should embrace our lineages for all the depth that they offer us.This is a concise guide with some really great points and suggestions that it offers. I would love to see Petter write a larger, more in-depth Reiki guide; his writing comes from the heart, as does his love of Reiki."
5,Next Generation of Reiki,"This book coincides with my begining of Reiki practice. I have been in the Health and Healing field for 20 years or more. I knew about Reiki but it never ""clicked"" right to my ears or to my heart. The stories or legends were too ""new age"" and did not convince me that Reiki was properly described neither presented in its full potential. With Frank Arjava Petter's ""Reiki Fire"" we have finally broken the veils of myth and legend, fairy tales and adaptations of the Reiki tradition. This book is a must for those who are interested in exploring the traditional healing systems of this world and Frank Arjava Petter offers to the reader a wonderful opportunity to expand this knowledge. A new generation of Reiki practitioners is unfolding from this information and I cannot but highly recommend this book as an historical turning point for the Reiki movement and for those involved in the natural healing path."
2,Disco Frenzy: Various artists,"All tracks are mixed very badly. I haven't heard mixing this bad since 1975. Also not all the tracks are original recordings. The cuts by Odyssey and the Three Degrees sound like live re-recordings. All cuts are very short, with the exception of Celi Bee ""One love"" which is reproduced in its' original extended 12"" mix."
5,What a blessing,"This album is a total blessing. I have been listening to it over and over for the past three weeks since seeing the Crabb Family in concert at the Brooklyn Tabernacle. The vocals are top notch and such gems as Through The Fire, Please Forgive Me and Covered in Red will touch your soul over and over again. The Crabb Family are a nice mix of southern gospel, country and a splash of black gospel. What a blessed family!"
4,Grandma is happy,"I bought this for my grandma, had it sent to her gift wrapped. She likes the Crabb family and said she has enjoyed the CD."
3,A disappointment in climax,"I thought the final confrontation would be more realistic (c'mon Black John lets a bunch of kids rebel against him?)He allowed them to resist him which I find unbelievable according to Smith's description of his power and his ability to wield control over the town. As for relationship's Smith tied them up too quickly, alot was left unresolved. However great characterization and ability to promote feelings in the readers."
5,Without a doubt the best book in the series!!!,"I love LJ Smith and own all of her series I've read them since I was in 7th grade and now I'm a Senior. If you liked this series, you MUST read them all including The Vampire Diaries and The Forbidden Game. I want another copy of them all because mine are so worn out from reading them."
5,Awesome book!,"Here is the conclusion to the trilogy and it continued where the second left off. Black John now holds a position of power in the town. He uses the people as puppets.Faye is rebelling from the Circle at the most critical time in its history. All members are needed to defeat Black John ... and quickly! A hurricane, that would have down graded to a tropical storm or veered away from land, is being controlled by Black John. If it hits land, millions will die! There is no time to evacuate. Even if there had been, Black John made sure no one could leave the area!The Circle has only three choices: 1. Give in to Black John's power 2. Let millions die 3. Pray for an inspiration to win the ultimate battle between good and evil! <P This was the best of the three! I hated to see the trilogy end! L.J. Smith is one fabulous author!"
5,A breathtaking series to please all readers.,I read this series when it was frist published and was truly disapointed to find this series out of print. It remains one of the best series' I've read and I believe that it should be re-published. Each book casts a spell on the reader that continues even after you have finished reading. L.J Smith is a very talented writer who introduces many provocative subject to her readers.
4,this book was awesome,"I liked this book a lot, but the ending was kind of disappointing for me. Nick was in the picture, but then he just faded out like he didn't matter. I agree the ending was kind of cheesy with Diana giving her permission to Adam and Cassie in the middle of the circle. But other than that I think the book was very interesting. Some of the things that happened I did not think of, but they made sense. I like how L.J. Smith makes sure every character that you ever read about has a purpose. It's really intriguing. You have to read this book."
4,POWER OF FIRE HAVE I OVER THEE,"the trilogy was nice...i pretty much liked all of it until we reached the part when they all say Cassie and Adam are soulmates and they make them kiss each other...HELLO what about Diane? did anyone consider her feelings? thats what sucks about it...she had history with adam, don't you think its rather hard on her to see her EX kiss a new girl?? Diane is a neat character but way too unrealistically nice...but all in all it was a nice trilogy"
5,The Little White Mouse Fights Back!,"I have never, ever, found a series as good as this one. I've read the Sweep series, which is wonderful, I've read Circle of Three which is...alright but no series has ever measured up to these three books. In this one Cassie starts to really find the power within. I don't just mean her witch powers but also a core within herself that makes her strong. The final showdown between her and her father is great. I was cheering for her all the way. This book has it all-strong heroine, dashing hero(es) (come on, we can't forget Nick!)and wonderful secondary characters. ..."
5,Awsome book,"I read all 3 books in less than a week. Every minute was exciting and it was one of those books you hate to put down. I felt that the ending of ""The Power"" was a tad cheesy considering Cassie and Adam were now a couple so easily with the consent of Princess Diana, But over all it was a heart warming story about the true strength of a friendship. And through the stages of a young teenage girls life. I also think this author did a great job of writing a some-what serious story dealing with a fictional plot but also adding fact into it. I was amazed at how addictive this book can get. It was a great book I think theres room for a sequal because I absolutly fell in love with all the characters even that cat woman Faye !"
5,Great Great Great Book!!,"I love LJ Smith books!!! My favorite have been Forbidden Games, but I like Vampire Dairies and The Secret Circles too. I have read the other Secret Circles and I have been trying to find this one forever."
5,Yes! This is a book review!,"This is a very good book. I have read this book repeatedly since 1997, and now finally own all three. I think this trilogy is one of the best by L J Smith because it's really one book split up into three volumes and goes alot more indepth than some of her other books.My favourite character is Nick, surprisingly enough but I don't think, like some other reviews I have seen, that he should 'get together' with Diana - the two characters are totally wrong for each other. The ending is rather predictable, but if Cassie didn't end up with Adam the entire trilogy would be pointless, as the basic theme is Cassie and Adam's tormented love for each other - though they don't work out until The Power that their love will never go away."
5,Awesome ending to a great trilogy!,"Here is the conclusion to the trilogy and it continued where the second left off. Black John now holds a position of power in the town. He uses the people as puppets.Faye is rebelling from the Circle at the most critical time in its history. All members are needed to defeat Black John ... and quickly!

Even if there had been, Black John made sure no one could leave the area!The Circle has only three choices: 1. Give in to Black John's power 2. Let millions die 3. Pray for an inspiration to win the ultimate battle between good and evil!***** This was the best of the three! I hated to see the trilogy end! L.J. Smith is one fabulous author! *****"
4,travelon purse,I loved it. I only wish it had been slightly bigger because I didn't want to have a full purse size. It was really packed with the essentials.
1,NOT ACCURATE,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT KEEP ACCURATE STEPS EVEN AFTER YOU FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO ENTER YOUR STIDES . IT DOES NOT HAVE A ON AND OFF SWITCH . I WILL NEVER ORDER A PEDOMETER ONLINE , I WILL HAVE TO SEE THE PRODUCT IN A STORE FIRST ."
3,Walker,I use this pedometer all day at the office and it works great. It's amazing how many miles you walk while at work.
2,"Looks good, but...","This video is very well made, but it is too general to be of much real use. It seems like it is more about foot massage than reflexology."
4,Another Great CD From The Producers,"Why this CD sat on the shelf for years at the band's former label is a mystery. There were definitely surefire hits on the album (""Renaissance"" and ""Out of My Head"") that had potential. Too bad. But here it is -- Coelacanth -- for your listening pleasure many years after the fact.I guess the only downside to the album is the dull brown cover art. Not bad, but not all that attractive. That's kind of petty considering the good music contained within (don't judge a book by its cover!), but I like cover art.If you're a fan of the band's previous albums, get this album while you can before it goes out of print and becomes impossible to find."
5,"Long Over due, but worth the wait!!","One has to congratulate One Way Records, they have been leading the forfront of Re-releasing music long out of print, or in the case of the Producers album ""Coelacanth"" letting it see the light of day, and boy--does it shine!!Granted it was supposed to be released 14 years ago, but it still sounds better they any current top 40 bands!Van Temple, Wayne Famous, Bryan Holmes and Tim Smith, have created a pure pop CD with all the right hooks and melodies that made the first 2 releases but the band so damn good!!So buy this and party like it is 1987!!!Looking forward to the re-release of the final Producers album ""Run for your life"".........."
2,Coelecanth,"For Producers fans, Coelacanth was one of those mysterious albums. We all heard the tunes. Just no album. There is a lot of controversy where Coelecanth is concerned. However, for most Producers fans, The Producers just wasn't the same after the departure of Kyle Henderson. Tim Smith is credited with giving the group another direction. This certainly changed the formula that made the Producers such a awesome group. The new direction changed the sound of the group. Coelacanth is frustrating to listen to. You hear the familiar hooks, but then it goes into completely somewhere else. The album is not good nor bad, but at least interesting. Wayne Famous's various keyboard styles are extensive, maybe overly done to cover very weak musical material. Let us be glad the album was not released in 1987. Certainly, it would be disappointing to say the least. Thankfully, the original group got back together, maybe a little too late to save."
5,Great for Chomsky fans,"This film may not be for everyone, and maybe it's not for people just starting to read up on Chomsky or watch a documentary about him for the first time...But it is classic Chomsky, and sometimes it's just pleasant to hear someone being consistent and making sense when they talk. More than anything else, that's what Chomsky means to me.He's a walking encyclopedia -- knows his stuff. He knows the definition of words he uses. He has a consistent and passionate sense of humanity. He's not a politician, not a liar, and not a hypocrite. And because of this, we love him. Because of this, the world would be a better place with more Chomsky in it. So get this film, and enjoy the delightful sound of someone telling the truth."
1,bored to extinction,"This documentary said about 37 huge mammals lived in North American thousands of years ago. Then, poof! They vanished. This work has great computer graphics. Those who liked ""Ice Age"" film may really like this.The problem is that they test their theory, which I'll try not to give away, by looking for a chemical element in ice and dirt. Yawn! Talk about a sexy intro with a frigid conclusion. This was dull. It just took the viewer along with the boring work that scientists do, not the cool summary that gives you info and allows you to move on."
2,Very inaccurate writing,"I don't normally review stuff, but this one time I had to say something. This book is wildly inaccurate at times, mostly in geography. Simple stuff like saying a break is north of another when it's south. More simple stuff like distances.There's one entry for Cabo San Lucas that says Todos Santos (the big wave break - not the town) is 60 miles north of Cabo. Well, it's more like 995 miles(!).... that 60 miles is to the town, which is not the big wave spot.Under Mavericks he says Jeff Hawks rode it alone for years. Even non-surfers know the name Jeff Clark.I could go on, but you get the point. It's not just a little inaccurate - it's way off base.Even the photos aren't particularly good - many are badly framed.I feel like this book was written quickly and without adequate research. Clearly the writer hasn't been to many of these spots, so why write about them without researching them first?There are far better coffee table surf guides out there."
5,Americana Circa 1960,"For a nostalgic look back at the USA circa 1960, you can't do any better than Route 66. Every episode is a look at a new location and the scenery, cars, buildings, dress, and people are like a living postcard from the era. Both Volume 1 & 2 are presented different than the 11 Classic episodes DVD released earlier in that there are no commercial interuptions. The commercials are combined into their own segment. I only hope the rest of the series is released soon, as those of us who loved the series can't get enough. Take a trip on Route 66!"
2,Be warned: Picture has been cropped!,"Route 66, like all TV shows of its era, was filmed in a squarish 1.33:1 aspect ratio. But for this ""Volume 2"" DVD set, the manufacturer has shamefully CROPPED the top and bottom of the image to about a 1.77:1 frame. Essentially, you are missing part of the picture and it ruins the original photography.Sure, it fills a ""widescreen"" TV, but at what expense? Tops of heads are frequently ""cut off"", and the cropping further deletes some of that wonderful Americana from 1960 that provided the mesmerizing backdrop of this classic series. The packaging does not warn you of this image tampering, so buyer beware! Maybe one day we'll see a re-release of the FULL image that was filmed and shown back in the '60s."
3,Infinity -- You lost a guaranteed sale with the cropping,"To Infinity Entertainment Group:What were you thinking? I bought volume 1 and lived with the subpar prints, now this 16x9 crap -- I mean crop? How does cropping to 16x9 help try to draw a bigger audience beyond the die-hards when the series is black and white to begin with? I was a guaranteed sale of this and future volumes, but you lost me with this bizarre move.Leave it to viewers whether they want to watch the show in a 16x9 picture.All decent HD sets have a zoom function to fill the screen for 4x3 pictures (avoiding stretch-fill), plus a way to adjust up and down to find the visual center (above true center.) Sometimes I watch classic TV like Star Trek this way and it's fun. But that's my choice. I do not want that imposed on me, as Infinity, you are doing."
2,What were they thinking?,"Make that five stars for the show itself, which gets better with every episode.The two stars is for Roxbury/Infinity's unaccountable botch job with the fake widescreen aspect ratio. Who thought that trimming the image at the top and bottom was a good idea? It's not: As with Warner's first-season set of ""Kung Fu,"" which was similarly mutilated, it's distracting and disrespectful and makes me regret that I bought the set.If you haven't yet, consider renting it instead -- or better yet, complain to the company and maybe they'll fix it for a rerelease. Sheesh."
1,"route 66, a ride to oblivion","I was looking forward to buying the new volume of season I, but after reading the majority of reviews on its release, I am not too sure. The reviews basically said they were pleased with the better audio but are abhorred at the video. Changing the format to a cheap lackluster version of letterbox for digital screens. Ah, for your info. Digital is coming next year and some people will get a converter or their cable will change them over to the new presentation. This is as bad as T. Turner colorizing vintage films because his hatred of B/W films. Let's have as it was, gents. As the old saying goes, ""If it ain't busted, don't fix it."
1,fakes beat the studios,"Out of curiosity, I read the reviews of this set. Three years ago, I bought an import set of the entire series off of internet's favorite 'auction' site for a bit less than a hundred dollars. Now, I realize that I made a wise decision. Sad to think that people making these compilations have no clue as to what they are doing to classic media. Cutting the 4:3 into a letterbox to simulate widescreen for people with big screen tv's? And losing part of the picture? Are they crazy? Glad I have the 'old' set, monophonic soundtrack and all. Maybe it's got all the ticks and pops of old time TV, but that's what we're after, isn't it?"
4,The Mother Road,I plan on buying a Corvette and hitting the road as soon as possible. After watching these shows I have a serious case of wonderlust.
4,Route 66 series still timely,I am emjoying watching the old shows on Route 66. The odd bits of wisdom and the insights into people's behaviour are still timely after all these years.
4,Better than Season 1 part 1,"In my opinion the quality of this DVD is slightly betrer than the 1st release of part 1 season 1. The audio still leaves something to be desired. Overall if your a Route 66 fan, pick up a copy."
2,Disappointed!,"Video transfer is great but a letterbox format for an old nostalgic tv show, I don't think so!Its annoying to watch,those black bars!Too bad!!Looks like it was done because we are at the drive in. Look!! Here comes Tod and Buz right now!You do gain side to side video but lose a little top and bottom, should have been a side B added feature with full screen on side A. If you have a widescreen tv its great."
1,AVOID this completely botched release. LOWEST RATING,"They've cropped the original picture for a fake widescreen effect, completely destroying the composition and cutting off heads, chins, feet, etc. This is a travesty. 4X3 material should be released in 4x3, these people don't know what they are doing.There is nothing else to say; as the episodes are ruined. They didn't so this with the first volume, so hopefully they'll come to their senses and release future sets correctly."
4,Packaging Description Errors,"Just an alert to those looking at the packaging for Season 1, Volume 2. The back of the case advertises that the enclosed episodes feature guest stars such as Suzanne Pleshette, Lee Marvin, and Jack Warden. WRONG. Those guest stars appeared in the previously released Season 1, Volume 1.Does no one perform simple proofreading of the product casing before they go to print????"
5,Good quality fair price!,Good quality for a fair price on an item that is not as easy as it used to be to find.
1,waiste of money,put this pad on a aluminum boat i am fixing up..haven't even had it in the water yet or even put on the motor and only after 3 weeks the rubber was spliting and cracking..

3,NCAA Univ. of Michigan Women's Watch,The watch is just ok....the band is definitely low quality. I will be very careful in the future when purchasing watches from this vendor.
4,A good history of Mary Edwards Walker: Above and Beyond,"Of all the books I've read on the subject of Mary E Walker, this is probably the best researched bio on Ms. Walker. The author took the time to provide many of the details I've had to research to get the correct facts. There are so many myths surrounding the woman.Well written and a must if you are going to write about or learn about Mary Walker.....its not perfect, but just about there."
5,The Diary Lives!,Twenty-five years ago the De la Peña diary breathed new life into the old story of the Texas Revolution. The controversy over the authenticity of the diary continues the process by showing its impact on people today. View this story on the VHS documentary The De la Peña Diary: A memoir of the Texas Revolution including the death of Davy Crockett also available through Amazon.
1,Believing in this is like believing in the tooth fairy!,"This book is a bunch of bunk.I cannot reccomend this to any serious sudent of Alamo and Texas history.If Pena wrote any of it, it was the first few pages that covered the march to Texas. Nothing else.It is a forgery plain and simple and painfuly obvious.There are so many errors in it that it is ludicrous to believe in it. But there are those who do and it is their right to be so misinformed.If you really want to study this subject, leave out this book and all the revisionist authors who believe in it."
1,An Alamo Defender,"The whole controversy surrounding this narrative seems to center around the way Mr Crockett met his end, and the onle reason this version is believed over the previous ones is its age and the fact that a Mexican supposedly wrote it. Does that mean that, in another hundred years or so, someone will rediscover the Rosswell flying saucer reports, and they will suddenly become the true version of what happaned? Just wondering..."
5,This book got me to take the plunge into Induction!,"After 2 months of studying low-carb diets, I picked up this book and read it cover to cover. It motivated me to finally follow the Atkins way of eating to the letter and commit to the Induction phase of Atkins. I highlighted passages and bookmarked the menu section, which I read everynight during my two weeks on Induction. I was able to stick with the program while living in a house with two other adults who eat an extremely high-carb diet. The book helped to understand the program throughly, so I could explain my new way of eating to others. I lost 10 pounds during the two weeks, and I am now in the On-going Weight Loss phase. Atkins is now my way of eating for the rest of my life!"
4,A must have.,"This is really essential for your Atkins/Low Carb library. Please be aware that this book will not (and should not) replace any of the more extensive books, but it is a must have to carry around with you for pointers, a quick read to get you back on track should you find yourself with an empty Wendy's bag in front of you and a #6 Biggie Sized combo in your tummy. It also is a good book to loan to those close to you, if they will read it at all. Since it is free of scientific terms and long-winded explanations, it is also ideal for anyone who wants to start the diet or just find out what it is about before getting into one of the detailed books."
5,This is Great if you like information summarized,"I love this book. I read Dr. Atkins book from cover to cover which is very important, but this book is a great brush up or even for a person who haven't the time to catch the vision and need the basic details quick. Its GREAT for INDUCTION phase, it cannot replace the Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution, but it is straight to the point for the program. I love it."
5,It works,"It works. Just stick to what it tells you to do. It won't be easy but what other choice is there? Remember, this is a life style."
3,Somewhat helpful,"I was looking or ideas to add to a low carb program I am already following. This book gave me a few new ideas, however, I found the general Atkins program to be too complicated for me to follow. So, in the long run, the book was not too helpful for my purposes. It may be great for others, just not for me."
1,Dr. Atkins is rolling in his grave!,"Poor Dr. Atkins. First his low carbohydrate diet was dismissed and mocked as a ""dangerous fad"". Next, only after his death did the medical literature begin to support his assertions concerning the benefits of low carb. Now, this latest ""Atkins"" book serves as a big advertizement for Atkins Nutritionals low carb products. Poor, poor Dr. Atkins.Save your money and your time. Buy, read and follow the diet as outlined in ""Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution, 3rd Edition"". Eating the low carb processed food will sabotage your chances of successful weight loss (I speak from personal experience)."
2,NOT A BOOK -Okay to purchase last....,"I keep reading where buyers call this a book. There is no book, this is NOT a book, NO book is included. It is only CDz, and everyone needs to understand that. I feel this is okay to purchase and listen to, but, it should not be in your first purchase to understand Atkins and follow a purchasing and meal plan. One needs the book to earmark the pages, highlight, and readily follow when at the store or beach in your new body and swim suit. These are NOT DVDz, nothing interactive, you can NOT look up deffinitions of foods, they are just audio files. Purchase, but, purchase last."
4,Total Tai Chi,It was a real bargain price; it's a lovely book. The only complaint is that the packaging wasn't good enough to protect the egdes of the book and they got a little banged up.
2,Limited Life Compressor,"Bought this to use around the house. It worked well for a while, even used it to install a room full of hardwood flooring with no problem. One day, it just would not pump up to pressure. It was cheap, so I tossed it. Too bad though, I liked the size and portability. The little brad nailer is still going strong."
2,get what you pay for,Leaked oil 1st time I started it up. During the first project I used it on I noticed it would not build pressure over 50psi. Took cover off and found the filter missing. Also did not receive the nail gun and accessories.
2,Misrepresentation,"This ""Kit"" was ordered as a gift. The compressor arrived without the Kit (18 gauge brad nailer, hose) . Amazon sent me a replacement ""Kit"" without the kit again. Bottom line, they didn't deliver what they advertised."
5,"Pleased, expectations were met.",A great collection of Manzanero's songs. I have several of the Platino collection editions and they have always produced good selections of the artist's works.
5,"Great stuff! - melodic rock, mellow to powerful","This is a really good album, first class all the way. I really like the songs. These guys can sing! And the music is powerful. I've heard other good stuff from Rainforest Records, but this is probably the best. My sisters like it alot too."
5,great stuff!,"nice printing, and informative text. some really interesting art here. you won't be dissapointed. all the work is very well documented, and the source material is all listed nicely at the end. great job!"
3,A SIMPLE CATALOGUE,"Many little images and no many words. It's a interesting book, but could be better."
2,Not for Professionals,"I am a NYS Licensed Massage Therapist and I bought this tape looking for new techniques or maybe extra anatomical information. I was disappointed. All the techniques here are old hat for anyone who has taken a massage class and the claim of it teaching ""2 full body massages"" is misleading. The video shows you 2 incomplete massages that you could merge into one. If you have never take a class in massage before, then by all means buy the video. It is simple to follow and does do a good job of illustrating basic and effective techniques. It is also short and inexpensive. If you are a professional, save your money for something else."
2,Not sexy or even sensual,"This is a kind of ""nuts and bolts"" massage presentation without any real enjoyment potential. Dull filming. It wouldn't work if you are romantically inclined."
4,Nokia 6131,"Recently I've got my new Nokia 6131. The phone is great. I've been using Nokia 6230 for a while and the best feature I loved in it was editable Voice Tags so whle driving you just press a button on your Bluetooth device, say a name from your Contact List (previously recorded by yourself), phone recognising your voice and dialing desired party. Very convinient. But this Nokia 6131 comes with prerecorded names tags for every contact you're entering which is not good because it doesn't work in you case. Different voice and prononciation so most of all times you're getting someone else instead by calling it's name into the Bluetooth. I can't understand what was the idea to do this.The other thing(was described in previous reviews) is a battery which doesn't stay longer than 2 days and needs to be recharged.The idea of Nokia 6131 is amazing, beautiful design and etc. I think Nokia has to recall this product for repair those 2 items."
3,Phone has a mind of its own,"This phone is quite nice, easy to use, the keyboard is great. However, there are two things that really annoy me - the screen gets dirty and disgusting. And - get this - the phone dials on its own! The thing just goes through the phone book and randomly calls people, as it is sitting in my purse. I have tried discussing with t-mobile this issue, and looks like will have to replace the phone itself. Very-very annoying, not to mention embarrassing."
2,Poor customer service,"I bought a 6131 for my Wife, which she came to like after 2 months of use. Nokia's web site said that I should upgrade the operating software to improve certain features. This worked great on my N73, so went to do the same on the 6131. Part way through the upgrade process the computer lost touch with the phone, and from that point on the phone was dead. I returned the phone to Nokia who have now had the phone two months of the four that I have owned it, and I cannot get any responses out of customer service/repair about its expected return to me. Just hope you never have to use Nokia customer support."
4,good phone,"pretty good phone.the good:large inner and outer screens.. 16.7 million colors is pretty coolloud ringtones and speakerphonelarge keypad with nice white backlightthe push flip is great. its somethin fun to mess withpretty fast internet connection with cingular's edgereception is also goodmusic playerbluetooththe not so good:camera really isn't all that great, especially in dark placesvideo is kinda choppybattery life doesnt last very longThe good outweighs the bad and this phone passes the test."
5,"nokia 6131 black, unlocked",Very good cell phone.if you want to get something with everything on it and to expenda reasonable ammount of money is a good option.
5,The White Stripes best...and that's saying ALOT!,"This album really blew me away.I heard 'Elephant', then I immediatly bought this album, 'De Stijl', and 'White Blood Cells'.This is by far the best of the four.Their most raw album by far.I just love it!Some of the highlights are 'Stop Breaking Down', 'Jimmy The Exploder', 'The Big 3 Killed My Baby', and 'Astro', to name a few.Any Stripes fan has to have this!Actually, any rock fan needs to have this!"
4,Raw first album: there is a silver lining on the dark cloud.,"I have to admit, listening to this gem was a bit of a struggle at first, but behold, the white stripes after a couple of listens have a ray of sunlight shine through with their first album (self titled no less).Quite simply, through the noise, the distorted yelping and singing with off key moments, distortion on guitars and what seems to be almost teenage angst, there is a silver lining to this dark cloud.If you have listened to the white stripes prior to this, you will notice that recording is a lot rawer then the past. I call it raw, what i really mean is quite poor quality, but thats because jack white recorded this on a shoe-string budget.Give it a go, even if its to just finish off your collection you will be suprised with this album. two thumbs up, but not the perfect white stripes album, not by a long shot."
1,Overrated with lousy production!,"I don't know what all the hoopla is with this band. I gave them a chance, after my wife bought the CD, and wanted to yank the disc out of the player from the getgo! The tunes are uninspiring and so basic, I thought I was listening to a bunch of grade schoolers slinging guitars! If this is considered 'back to basics garage rock', give me The Hives and The Strokes over this anyday! At least their songs are more memorable and musical."
1,Bands like this prove rock music is going down the tubes!,"This CD is nothing more than another lousy untalented release of some stupid overnight 4 chord modern-day garage band that the young pimply 'trendoids' have latched onto in order to look hip and 'with the times'! Fact is, the musicianship and songs on this release are lacking in a big way, and these clowns sound like rank amateurs, if that. They are a band that proves that most young music fans have very low standards as to what they expect from musicians these days, in comparison to older folks, who grew up in a time when rock bands were arguably better and more talented! This CD would make a good expensive coaster."
1,don't waste your money,first of all if you want to spend money on music get the strokes second of all if i could rate this a negative five i would
2,Man does this is not good,"It is not good. It does have a couple good tunes....thats about the only positive thing I can say about it. For all the hype they are getting, I expected to be blown away. It was not to be. Oh well, it will make a good coaster."
1,this band is retarded.,"This band blows and so does the album. How can anyone not jump off a building trying to listen to this crap? The most annoying vocals in the world, i swear. I mean, seriously anyone who listens to this junk has to be pretending to like it."
5,What the hell is going on in Detroit?,"This band could save Rock & Roll from the ugly state it has it's self in. All of their albums are a godsend; if they come to your town, see them NOW, before they start to fill ampetheatres."
4,Great album,Everything was great except the free download code did not work. I sent an email which they responed to within 5 days and issued another. havent tried it yet. Great tunes.
5,GREAT GREAT REALLY GREAT,this is excellent. all the songs are uniqu and still blow me away each time i listen to it.BEST WHITE STRIPES ALBUMS (in order)THE WHITE STRIPESWHITE BLOOD CELLSELEPHANTDE STIJL
3,"Cool, but...","This record is certainly cool, but if I'm looking for really raw, minimalist RnR with just 1 guitar & drums, then I'd rather take Bantam Rooster - they're wilder, faster, meaner and cooler, too. For a fuller Garage sound, then, I'd take Jeffrey Evans & His 68 Comeback - they got more SOUL."
1,not quite as good as The Flat Duo Jets/ sorry,"This CD was OK but an obvious rip off of the flat duo jets. I recommend getting the real mcCoy. If you like this then Go buy Dexter Romweber`s latest CD, ""Chased By Martians"". He was the guitarist/singer from The Flat Duo Jets."
1,About as original as an 80's cover band!,"TWS serve up rehashed basic chords and basic, boring grade-school drumming that are supposed to somehow make them seem original, hip, and supposedly forging a 'new direction'. All this CD offers is a third-rate mishmash of directionless, already done a million times garage band talentless noise by a duo of dorky mediocre musicians with bad fashion sense, who insist on dressing in candy cane colors as part of their schtick. Maybe if they entered the music scene in the late 70's/early 80's 'post punk' era, they would have been appreciated more. Bottom line... life is short... don't waste your time!"
5,"Not the best sound quality, but still worth the buy","Although there seems to be something wrong with the sound quality of this album, it is still an essential buy for any Stripes fan. Right from the start there is a hard rock atmosphere, but the absence of soft songs can likely be pardoned due to Jack and Meg's young ages at this point in time. ""Astro"", one of my favorite Stripes songs, has a great electric guitar beat going on that bears similarity to the Kings of Leon (yet the White Stripes came first) while at the same time Jack White is singing about people doing some apparent dance called the Astro. Then there is the great song ""Stop Breaking Down"", a real sticks-in-your-mind kind of tune that has playful guitar and a rather awesome rhythm. Every melody, in fact, has a good rhythm, and for this reason I would give the White Stripes' debut album a five star rating. Jet and Kings of Leon fans also ought to like this CD."
2,What's up with this album?,"I am a big fan of the White Stripes, and will remain one, however, I don't know what happened on this one. Actually, De Stijl was the first of their CD's I purchased, and I loved it, so I bought White Stripes. To be honest, I don't think this disc has a single sane-written song on it. The whole thing is just blastig out guitar on every track, making them all sound the same. It's a shame that the White Stripes had to give in to cheap not-like-their-music-loud-punk-rock for their debut. I know lot's of people like that sort of thing, but this CD just seemed kind of disappointing campared to other White Stripes albums."
5,A Successful Underdog,"This book was different than I expected. I figured it would be more like the movie with the same title.The book gives you a much better picture of Tom Sullivan, how he started, the battles he fought, his successes, and how he's dealt with difficult situations in life. If you're disabled and even if you're not, this book can give you the incentive to look upon and approach disabilities and the disabled community differently.It certainly is a ""must read."""
2,Collin Raye - Live,"The album is a let down.Many tracks from the show are missing.Also most tracks are not complete songs. Nothing wrong with the singing!, but 53 seconds of ""If I Were You"" is not good enough.Buy the DVD instead, at least it has got all the show."
4,Tasty British Treat,"This is the last season of this crazy and hilarious show. Well worth the time to purchase and watch. We watch them one at a time to make it last longer.Which brings me to the sole negative point - we purchased the discs the day they were released, and just recently got to the third disk, which turned out to be damaged. We are a couple weeks beyond the return period, so we will be buying a second set to get the last disk.Check the disks when you get them! Four stars only for issues with the physical media."
3,good stories; very poor quality DVD,"The stories and performances are on a par with the earlier series, but many of the episodes are ""washed out"" - it's as if the brightness setting is on high and there's little to no contrast. It's either defective or a very poor quality production, but it does affect the viewing experience. too bad..."
3,Bob,"This is the second Hanson novel that I have read, the former was Spare Parts and this one is nowhere near the same quality of that novel. Extreme Odds just wasn't as entertaining as Spare Parts even though it had the same ex cop character Adam McCleet.In this novel McCleet accompanies his friend to the country of Bob, a country newly formed on an Indian reservation by his friend's son Buddy who is a real estate developer. Bob has attracted over 200 immigrants most of which have their own agendas. There's the hemp growing female farmer, gun fanatic, religious cult leader, casino/radio operator and many others as well. Buddy is about to open his own bank where he is about to launch his own currency swapping US dollars for Bobs, but murderers have their own plans which make the situation in Bob extremely personal for McCleet."
3,Carl Hiaasen-like comedy/ adventure --I liked it.,"Carl Hiaasen's books are so rare, someone finally came along and took advantage of his absence! While McFleet, Rick's detective-fall guy, bears a slight resemblance to Hiaasen's heroes, this good-natured romp is a quick, enjoyable read, sure to please, and may make Mr. Hiaasen think about coming out of retirement!"
3,"Good Music, Bad history write up","Contains what remains of show recorded early in 1970 called ""Doing their Thing"", (Child in Time is only full length song from this show) but the band are firing on all cylinders. Also some German Videos with the Guitar feedback at the start of ""Highway Star"" edited off. Also contains 3 good, not great, versions of Purple songs performed by Ian Gillan and his band. The write up on the inside cover has the history of the band wrong, stating Gillan and Glover joined in 1970(They joined in 1969) Good but not great DVD."
3,Hmmmm,Pretty good dvd... but it could have used a lot more footage. Only buy it if your a big deep purple fan.
4,I did not think Paul could top his last CD,Paul Taylor breathes fresh air into smooth jazz. His last CD Avenue was fantastic but Hypnotic is just has great.
5,Incredible Sax Player,"Paul Taylor continues to shine with the release of Hypnotic. Paul's distinctive sound touches the soul like no other. His sax comes alive with a passion and freshness each time I listen. His previous releases, On the Horn, Pleasure Seeker and Undercover were excellent but Hypnotic exceeds them. I am eagerly awaiting his next release, ""Stepping Out"". If you haven't heard Paul's music, start with Hypnotic and I am sure you will have the others in short order"
3,What do you call typos on television?,"I purchased this video for a college-level course on weather. I was annoyed that before I showed the video, I had to warn the students about significant inaccuracies in the video. For example, the video has the Trade Winds blowing in the wrong direction. Nice footage, though."
4,Work Well To Store Slides,"This product worked perfectly for my needs. I needed a way store my Dad's old slides after I scanned them. These storage boxes are sturdy. They also come with an insert to keep the slides from falling over if the box isn't completely full. My only complaint is that the dividers that came with each box don't fit. I already had my own dividers, so this wasn't a problem for me."
5,I wish they had a DVD of the CD show.,"When I bought this ,I assumed it was the video of the Billy Bob's live CD.While this is a good show,the other was one of my favorites of Merle's .He had a great guitar player on the CD,on this video Merle plays guitar.Hag can really sing and write,but as a guitar player he should hire that out.But, back to the subject,this video is great quality,sound and visualy.There are two familiar faces ,Norm on steel and old what's his name on horns.The last time is saw a Hag concert,he had a pickup band,which was great,Merle played guitar quite a bit,but a better picker was playing second guitar.I doubt we will see the great bands he carried back in the eighties.Merle Haggard doesn't have to prove anything to anyone ,he sings as well now as ever ,and still writes goods songs.Buy it,you'll like it."
3,no closed captions,"Amazon product description clearly states ""closed captions"" My disc, as r'cvd, had no CC or subtitles. It's a great disc visually but for someone with a partial hearing loss it's like buying a car and then discovering that the transmission is missing. I have given it a way. Apparently, the producers of this disc are arrogant cretins who are totally un-aware that about half the population of the world has some degree of hearing loss. I certaninly won't be buying anything produced by Rick Smith & Associates."
5,brilliant as always!!,"This single has to be one of the best singles released by The Cure. It's on the more upbeat side (seeing as how it was the Mixed Up era and they were doing that dance band thing). Harold and Joe is an incredibly good nonsense-lyric song and actually holds up to some of their earlier dance pop classics. Let's Go To Bed (Milk Mix) is easily the best Cure remix ever released, definitely better than anything on the Mixed Up CD, making me wonder why it got pushed to b-side obscurity.. (As a note, my other favorite remix from Mixed Up, ""Why Can't I Be You (extended)"", is only on the cassette version..arrgghh). Anyway, this single is a must have!"
4,I must find this disc!,"I listened to this single just a few times a number of years ago when a friend picked it up, and absolutely loved it. But when I went to try and find it, no dice. Label out of stock! Rarely do I pine this way for an EP of just 4 tunes, but the Big Mix of Never Enough really tears it up. Also, Harold & Joe quickly became one of my all time favorite Cure tunes. If you find this rare gem, you better pick it up before I do!"
4,an aquired taste,"The Man has skills, the music is spot on, slow and dreery with a lot of heart. NOT a mainstream lp (qualifies for an extra star), if your looking for radio pop go some where else. I very much appriciate the musicianship but a little too slow for my taste."
5,Quietly intense,"This is my first exposure to M. Ward. Glad I ran across him via a recent Starbucks sampler he contributed to of all things. Sometimes he's grooving on Tom Waits, next Marc Bolan, then Louie Armstrong(how's that for coming out of the left field of influences?), then George Harrison, then acoustic Beck, all with a pseudo Dave Matthews vibe going on. Nick Drake's shadow looms large over the proceedings too. Intense, eclectic, cool stuff. This is the kind of musician who's doing it because he's into it, not because he wants to become a ""star"" or make huge amounts of money and fame. Having said that, he deserves all that and then some."
4,Old Timey Goodness.,"Most of the album's songs mainly consist of double guitars; one strumming in the background and the other playing short sweet riffs. Sounds great for a relaxing scenic drive down to the Homeplace. It gives an ""old timey/appalacian"" feel, as if it would fit perfectly on the ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack. #7 is a cover of Bach, really interesting. #8 is mostly piano, reminds me of ""Linus & Lucy"" from Charlie Brown. Too many filler tracks on the end. Suggested tracks are 1, 2, 4, 6, 8."
3,A rare chance to see a master rehearse an orchestra.,"An old (1958) but none-the-less fascinating video of one of this century's great Maestros rehearsing the Vancouver Festival Orchestra in Canada - an orchestra he had never before conducted. In addition, an interview, which although somewhat cliched in nature, gives a great insight into the musical mind of Dr. Walter. Extremely useful as an instructional tool, especially if you look past the actual rehearsing to the interpretation he is attempting to achieve with the orchestra. (It also helps if you are acquainted with Brahms). A fine amplification of the 'Great Conductors' video also available through Amazon."
5,"Grasshoppers, cornbread & icy cold lakes...","THE place to start your journey with the ballad-hunter John Lomax phenomenon, Leadbelly. Every river-bottom country song is great. The production sounds as if were recorded by a campfire. Stirring blues, ragtime piano, slave songs, ballads, reels, spirituals and chain-gang hollers. Recorded in 1944 in Hollywood for Capitol Records when he was 60 years old."
3,Chi Gung,Good for people who want to no how to do the movements of chi gung. This dvd is missing the main aspect of chi gung. There is very little on how to breath with the movement and there is nothing on what the breth is about. The inhalation is the chi. This dvd should have explained how the chi is collected in the body to rengerize the body throw the movements. It is still good if you want the movements without the understanding
3,this one takes breath and patience,"Qi gong, like yoga and tai chi, depends upon breath. Deep, sustaining breaths. I couldn't get all the way through the CD since this is sinus season. I can only hope, as I get further into the CD it will show the slow, sustained movements I'm used to. I have to say I was slightly disappointed; but I admit I've only seen a small part of the exercises.Pat Anthony"
3,"Good overview, but some things are out of date","I had this as the textbook to the general paleontology course I took as an undergrad at the University of Florida back in the late 1990s. I found it to be quite thorough and useful as a general intro, though as the field had already progressed significantly in many ways by that time (and moreso by now), I found it wanting for methodological or conceptual uses. I would certainly still recommend it as an intro to many of the key issues in paleontology - I still refer to it for reminders of some apsects of paleo that I do not encounter frequently in my work - but I would not consider it ultimately as useful as some other texts out there that are more recent if you are planning to start a career in paleontology."
4,Good instructional DVD,Simple and to the point good demonstrations ... a few positions were repeated for different stages of labor... that was just a little redundant but for the most part I was pleased
5,IBirth,Very helpful! Easy to follow information for expectant couples and the family & friends who help them during labor and delivery!!!
4,I like it,"very self-conscious and smart, often a bit show-offy and exhibitionistic, but that keeps your attention; great intro paragraphs on each chapter, great stuff on putrescence. Probably the best, most imaginative, and bravest book written on Scorsese."
1,Wheres's The Real Music of The Royal Jesters?,"Not bad but not the real ""Royal Jesters"" from years past. I'm from San Antonio, Texas home of the Royal Jesters. Heard and danced to their music at the La Salle private school for boys gymnasium back in the 60's. To bad that some people will say that The Royal Jesters do such a good job on the take of ""Que Casualidad"" when only Joe Bravo can do that song justice. How about ""Reina De Mi Amor"" only Sunny Ozuna is the original and the best, even ""Angelito"" come on, only Rene and Rene can only have been the ones to make that song the greatest. ""We Go Together"" this recording better then the original! No Way! Whomever commented on that has never really heard the original. Must have been to young to appreciate the old original recording......"
4,Great fun head start for such an important subject!,We loved this book! This is for people who want to incorporateeducation into fun times with the kids but are sometimes short onideas. I would recommend this book for working parents because it is easy to be organized or introduce projects at a moment's notice when bits of time are found. All of the ideas and instructions are right there in front of you. It would also be easy to leave for a caregiver as a lesson plan. Stay at home moms can certainly use this book to help fill the many hours constructively.
4,Poignant tale of survival !!,Frances Slocum is a small child of four or five when she is captured by Lenape Indians near the Fort of Wilkes Barre. Frances quickly adapts to her new life and is admired by her adoptive family for her red heart. As she grows to be a woman the struggles of Native American life become her own. The constant battle for survival against the encroaching white settlers and the soldiers they bring. Over 60 years of her life are covered in this tale of historical fiction.What I found so endearing was the love shown to her by her adoptive family and the continual unending love of her biological family as they search for their beloved Frances for sixty years.This story seems to be well researched and I am going to try to find out more about Frances Slocum.Mr. Thom once again has written an incredible tale.
3,Good Indian Information/Boring Read,"Apparently, little Frannie Slocum had a weak bladder because it is constantly betraying her throughout the first part of Mr. Thom's book. Why the emphasis on bodily fluids I do not know. An interesting event in colonial history, but at least for my own part it did not hold my interest."
1,Red Heart,"I was going to buy the book because of enjoying ""From Sea to Shining Sea"" so much. But the review I read about how the author changed the facts to portray Native Americans thru the telescope of ""political correctness"" changed my mind. Please will somebody tell me it ain't so?????"
5,Delightful gift!,"I received Mystical Delights as a gift and am very pleased. It has inspiring poems, some intriguing quotations from the poets, and a wonderful commentary. The commentary helped me get more out of the poetry than I ever thought I would. The book has some gems about advanced experiences of meditation and enlightenment, mixed in with a discussion of the mystical experiences of the poets. The poems are by great poets from all times and climes. I felt they lifted me into a higher reality. In the chapter about the mystical power of poetry, there's a quotation from Coleridge that ""Inspiration is the infinite I AM reverberating in the Imagination."" I think that state of consciousness comes thru in this book. Reading the poems, I have come to understand in a new way how we need the inspired words of those poets who are able to feel and express the motions of their souls. I hope that you enjoy the Mystical Delights anthology as much as I did."
5,Durable and easily adapted.,I've used this plow for one season already and was very pleased with it's performance. I was able to use the universal mounting hardware to attach it to my ATV with no issues. Good high quality steel blade with adequate adjustments.
1,Buyer Beware!,"If you need service on your TV, you will be in trouble. They do not answer their phones and do not respond to emails.I purchased a 32"" Syntax/Olevia LCD and the Kreisen at the same time and for the same price. The Syntax is so much better in terms of quality and performance. There is only basic a/v connections, the remote is horrible and the picture is really bad.Most important is no service after your purchase. Maybe they have gone out of business???For the money, I would purchase the Syntax/Olevia."
2,tiffany lamp....,"disappointed......it was supposed to come with a chain, but it didn't....so, therefore, i'm disappointed......description not accurate....i am not happy"
5,The launch of true satire by men who got it right 1st time,"The legendary performance by 4 true geniuses. Oh, if we could only have this on vid....I have spent a great deal of time playing this to people who finally get it. The launching pad for Monty Python, Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, et al, is right here. These 3 CDs contain the cream of the 60's satire crop by 4 very affable chaps not afraid to take convention and a sledgehammer and juxtapose the two. The material is first-rate and the performances practically flawless. One or two bits do require more visual, but the gist is just as good--gets the mind working.Even the material that is dated (Harold Macmillan et al) holds up well because, in all honesty, have politicians really changed all that much in 40 years? I think not--it's just more public now.Get this set by any means. You will truly treasure this gem for years to come."
5,What could have been,Such a shame this comedy troupe broke up. Humour with surgical precision. Roots of Python found here. You'll listen over and over again.
5,If you know these departed boys... you have rare taste,"The penultimate British humor that makes Monty Python sound like Disney. The best fans know their recording of ""At the Drop of Another Hat..."" Try to find Sue Townsend's ""The Queen and I"" for even more fun."
5,One of the Best Cd's. Swing Surf & Country,"This has to be one of the best Big Sandy albums in a LONG time. Don't get my wrong. I love Big Sandy's music, but the last album was very weak. This album makes you want to play it over and over again. You will be singing and dancing to this one in no time. If you have not heard of Big Sandy, this would be a great album to start off with. A big ol' 5 Stars!"
5,Big Sandy Purchase,"I received the product in excellent condition, and in an expedited manner. Will do business with seller again."
2,Disappointing! A bad edition and printing.,"This book is a poor edition and compilation of Sor Juana's poetry. First, it's small, thin, and printed in very poor quality yellowed paper with smudged ink. The content is not Sor Juana's best. Don't recommend it at all."
4,Freestyle at its best !!!!!!!!,"This is a realy good freestyle cd i must say Nick Colon is one of the best singers on it. If u like george lamond and know the new school singers like george anthony,poze ect.... u will love this kid.i give it 4 stars because of him! he writes ,produces and sings for other artist besides his self. Like i said this is a must have if u luv freestyle music !!!!!!!"
5,Perfect companion to your work out routine,This is the best weight training log for the price. I have used others but this one is for a full year where as some logs only go for 6 weeks. I hope that next year they would come out with a stronger cover.
5,It Began With A Roar,"I very much enjoyed this book. It was actually more like ""homework,"" (more figurativerly, than litterally), for me for what I do and therefore had very valuable information. Being a native San Diegan, it was also very interesting to learn more about the early days of San Diego and see some of the early photos of the area."
1,I give it 1 star for its study in crackpot extremism,"Phylis Schlafly, associated with the extremist xenophobic John Birch Society, puts together a paranoid philonuclear diatribe here, that completely ignored the situation in the 1960s.The idea that a ballistic missile defense is somehow useful is still sold as snake-oil by right-wing crackpots and defense contractors, but, back then, as now, it simply doesn't fly.The recent ""remarkable advances"" in ""missle defense"" were only made by incorporating GPS transmitters into ""targets!"" Engineers- speaking honestly, without a financial stake in the outcome- have known this and spoken about this for decades. It's a big welfare program, plain and simple.The idea of a ""winnable"" nuclear war is hideously immoral, and the Dr. Strangeloves and their consorts, such as Schlafly should be consigned to the ash-heap of history PRONTO."
5,"'Just For You""","This CD is best overall listening and dancing music in very long time, every track is good. With Pepe's dynamic voice and great band,the getto blasters really ""rock"" the house. With oldie classics like: : ""Grazing in the grass"", ""working on a groovy thing"" ""All This Love"" Debarge song, ""What You see is what you get"" dramatics, That's All, midniter's classic, then he does some great makes of Tejano classic, Juana La Cubana, Chiquilina, and El Mudo..guranteed to keep you dancing!!! he does, "" ou and I alone, by Mark Roberts, and ""hey"" by David Sanborn with a Latin hot taste, and ends it up with Come Back.........wow great crusing music.."
4,Come see what Mama's Cookin' - sweet sounds from a new band....,Certainly not as developed as their FIVE STAR self titled 2007 release but will show you the grooves and stylings of one of America's great unheard of bands. As the other reviewer noted this CD covers many musical stylings whereas their most recent CD is more firmly grounded in funky blues ala Led Zep. A bit uneven at times but a great rock band tuning up their talents. Highly recommended but if unsure get their 2007 self titled release and go back from there.The lead singer Early has a very unique rock voice which resonates unlike anything I have heard of late. You can still hear the band searching for their true soul though not found until their latest release. Check this out if daring and if not I HIGHLY suggest you check out their latest self titled CD and hear what I am talkin' 'bout.'nuff said.............
3,A Little Sample Of.....,"I dont care too much for this collection of songs. Sure, there all O.K with a few really good ones (Buy out the bar, Herbsman hustling, etc..}but it really just showcases a consistently good reggae musician. Any studio recording of his is just as good.If you haven't heard much of this great musician and only want to buy one recording of his, this may satisfy you."
4,"An Interesting Look Back at ""That"" town.",Thoroughly enjoyable continuation of the town everyone's heard about. I'd love for someone to write a continuation.
3,a quick read,"This book was good,but not as good as peyton place!!! The second book is never as good. Definently worth buying. It is a quick and fun read and takes you back to Peyton Place and all the scandals!!!"
4,A refreshing twist on modern ebm music,"Cesium_137's new album Elemental delivers a healthy dose of energetic electronic music. It's all generally high-bpm, and the vocal styles range from distorted to clear. The real beauty of this album is it's bravery to explore all kinds of styles...all of which are typical of the ebm genre, but the way they are implemented keeps things entertaining from beginning to end. Even though every track is original, I think the most played hits here are going to be Atrophy and Frayed. The videogamy music may turn off fans of the darker side of industrial/ebm, but Elemental is a great choice for those looking for a light-hearted guilty pleasure to throw into the mix now and then."
3,i've heard better,but i've also heard worse. i'd say this is better then your average EBM release these days.. but alot of the songs just arent that memorable. Stand outs for me include Echoes and Hymn.
3,"Gaslight Square Revisited by someone been there, done that","This is not really a review, more of a Thank You for realising the talent of Tommy Wolf ,and also Fran Landesman. My dad was a hepcat in the gaslight era in St. Lou and knew all these people very well and told stories about them quite well. As a matter of fact, my mother told me the first time she felt me quicken in her womb was at an evening at the Crystal Palace in 1961, which as I'm sure, that Ronny Whyte knows thats where Tommy got his start. Ronny , thank you for giving life to a composer that I just really never got his due."
2,"Naw,( HELL NAW!!!)","Dis aint DF material at all. No poetic spittin like Kast, jus straight hardcore elementary rap. Its the same weak $!@# that everyone says, but it hurts my soul to see Cool Breeze go that route. Don't support dis cd. Maybe he will go back to bein a lyricist instead of waste studio time."
2,"Barely functional, choose another brand","I do a lot of lap swimming and I used these plugs quite a bit until I found some better. These plugs are too big for my ears - covering more than just the ear opening so it was difficult to keep them in place. The silcone is not flexible enough to meet the complex contours of the outer ear, but the plugs are so big they need to do so. I have had these fall out during swimming more than once, and they do not float, so they just get lost in the pool. I think they are better than no ear plugs at all if you have sensitive ears (which I do), but I greatly prefer Putty Buddies (kids ear plugs) and no longer use Speedo."
1,Simply trash.,"I've been swimming regularly for 8 years, and have always had problems with water getting into my ears. My choice ear plugs were the rubber speedo earplugs, but this summer after losing my last pair I decided to give these silicon ones a try. It was a nightmare.The first time I tried them, it was hard to get them on; the silicon is actually quite hard and pressing it into my ear involved a few moments of irksome discomfort. Then, after a few days I realized that since the main approach by these things to stay on your ear is by sticking (on the instruction it says not to elongate the silicon or press it in too deep - makes sense, if a piece breaks off in your ear you are in a load of trouble), if you didn't put it on perfectly or forget to put them on before you enter the water, there's no way to put them on again unless you come out and dry your ears.Take my words for it and try not to waste your time with these."
2,"Buy real plugs, not hunks of silicone","I'm the first to admit that I didn't read the description carefully. But these aren't earplugs. They're hunks of silicone that you can shove into your ear. You mold them to fit, you take them out and press them into a flatter shape so they fit into the plastic box.Get earplugs instead."
5,Great for small or odd shaped ear canals!!,"I have very small ear canals (one of which has a bend in it) and regular ear plugs fall right out of my ears. These work very well and form fit to any ear, however, for swimming, I recommend a swim cap or headband to fit over these to keep them from falling out, as the water can loosen them. They are also great ear plugs for use out of the water. I've used them at loud concerts, the shooting range and even when I had to share a hotel room with my very loud snoring sister, worked like a charm!!"
1,"From a beginning swimmer, please pass on these","I just started swimming and about 3 weeks into it, decided to buy these to prevent swimmer's ear. Unfortunately, I got swimmer's ear. I reasoned it was due to not using any plugs for about 3 weeks and these would work with continual usage after the infection cleared.After 10 days of antibiotics and ear drops, I was feeling better and went back to the pool CONTINUING TO WEAR these plugs.Today, I went to the doctor and I'm back on ear drops for a week. I came to the internet to find what others were using because using these DO NO GOOD FOR ME.I'm going on a swimming vacation next week and will find out what the swim studio recommends. I will carry one of the unopened sets with me to see what they think.Folks, stay away from these. Do some research. Just because it says Speedo doesn't mean anything. I'm on my second bout of swimmer's ear in about 2 months of swimming because I thought that I was protected by these."
5,Fantastic Poirot mystery!,"Ranking as one of the best Hercule Poirot novels, ""Five Little Pigs"" takes the reader on a true psychological adventure worthy of the great detective. Following Poirot's favorite dictum, Christie methodically walks the reader through the events of a nearly two decade old murder through the eyes of the five principle witnesses... and suspects. The unconventional presentation of the facts of the case help cast the reader into Poirot's shoes, and Christie's marvelous character development leaves you wondering until the very end what actually happened that fateful September day. Truly one of Agatha Christie's finest literary works!"
4,Still damn good,"This CD definatly isn't Ebony Tears best work. Myself and a lot of other Metal Heads I know think that Ebony Tear's old sound was much better then this newer sound. However if you do enjoy it, look (hard) for the Dog Faced God's album called 'Random Choas Theory'. Dog Faced Gods was an Ebony Tears side project which influenced them enough to change their Ebony Tears sound to this new style."
2,These are not art quilts.,"I was really disappointed in this calendar. The quilts are NOT art quilts at all, and the designs are really repetitive and humdrum. I bought this as a gift and don't want to give it to the quilter in question. Also, it's flimsy and the paper is thin. Look for something else!!"
5,Ten Years Later and Still Takes My Breath Away,"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite romantic music CDs! ""I'm Your Present"" still has the ability to make me weak! :-)Christopher Williams is an EXCELLENT balladeer (skip the fast tracks --huge waste of time!)"
1,breathtaking political correctness,"There are simply too many mistakes in this book for it to be of the academic standard it aspires to. Zizek, Bal, Kristeva, Butler... too many of those people have found this book ""feminist"", which it is not, or ""breathtaking""; too many people are too easily convinced nowadays by such lousy arguments and are heading forward to what you could call a hysterical delirium or ""Hegelioglobalisation"" or the euphoria of the wildest dialectical syntheses (did Zizek start the fire? hard to tell...). The mistakes contain formost her remarks on Nietzsche (he was the Super-Hysteric! not one among others!), not to speak of the Wagner-Kundry-Hytericization, the reference on Deleuze in a footnote that refers to a book which does not (!) contain the notion of the ""rhizome"" she quotes (she probably did not care to read Deleuze, for the rhizome is rather the contrary of her ""Omphalos"") etc. etc."
2,over the top,"This is a very detailed analysis of various artists and films etc. Bronfen has done an exhaustive anlysis of Hitchcock's Marnie which seems inaccurate. It is very doubtful that Marnie fulfills the diagnosis of being an hysteric. Marnie would appear to have narcissistic wounds;a narcissitic personality disorder;PTSD, and a quite sever disorder of the Self. . And anyway one wonders how usefu this is as a way of viewing the film or book. although the book is very intersting, its basic tennent is unconvincing."
1,Re-published propaganda footage from the 60's.. HORRIBLE!,"Since I love documentaries, my brother got me this dvd set along with ""Trenches, Battleground WWI"", for Christmas. And let me tell you... stay away from anything produced by Madacy Entertainment. All this contains is some old public domain footage from the US military's propaganda department, and there is literally nothing of value in terms of education or information. Then, there is some low rent, uneducated, and disheveled old man, whose seems to be robotically reading from a cue card in his basement, as he spumes some quick political propaganda which has no direction or meaning.Since they were gifts, I can't get too angry, but at the same time I feel like everyone needs to know what a scam they're running. Save your money on anything this company publishes for sale... THIS HAS ZERO DOCUMENTARY,OR ENTERTAINMENT VALUE!"
2,US Propaganda - Very Bias,"This should serve only as reference material about US propaganda machine during the Vietnam conflict. All US made films about what units did and how many casualties they inflicted, never really getting into the affects on their troops or our casualties. As the history books state, US completely overstate their success in these films. They are good only as a reference, some good maps and battle footage. I wouldn't buy it again. I want the real story, not this spoon fed dribble."
1,Don't Buy This,"This was a cheap piece of junk. The kind of thing you find in toy machine dispensers at supermarkets. The chain was to small and flimsey and this was not an exact replica. As a big ROCKY fan i was really looking forward to this,my disapointment was big enough to give this review to help people save a waste of 20 bucks. Don't Buy This ...trust me."
1,flat,"It’s not good at all, it flat which makes it look ridicules, and its printed on it title for no reason, I won’t ever recommend it"
1,dissapointed,very bulky and cheep. smaller would have been better. it was slow coming 2 weeks is too long. it does not look like the picture

2,were are the jonts,this is a crap pack. it dont come with jonts i wanted luther reigns but disaponting i wanted one with jonts because it is the only one that i will see dont buy if you RA
2,Angle & Reins SUCK!!!!,Well first off the photo lies it says the elbows bend but they F****N dont. Reins is okay I guess but angle sucks like hell. If you want my advice dont get it because they are hell a lame.
3,hurt toy not cool,I dont like kurt angle or luther reigns. and i hope kurt dosent win the elimination chamber but i have a felling that he is.that will suck more than how bad kurt angle sucks. good luck to CHRIS MASTERS go masterpiece.
4,good movie,"grandson loves the whole set, but the first and tenth in the series are his favorites! this movie does not come up to the expectations of 1 & 10!"
5,A Real Help!,So very helpful. I couldn't agree with every conclusion but much insight is gained in reading this volume. He lays it out in a very understandable fashion. Highly recommended!
5,"""A standard -- to be prized!""","How did the books of the Bible come to be recognized as Holy Scripture? Who decided what the shape of the canon should be? What were the criteria that influenced these decisions? If you don't know the answers to these important questions, you can! And there is no better book to read than this scholarly classic by F.F. Bruce."
4,A well documented history of the canon,I bought this book because it was recommended as the most authoritative history of the New Testament canon in English. The book is scholarly and thorough. The author is an academic. The book reflects that for better and worse. The information is excellent and well documented. The writing style is often dry. It is best read in small segments.Bill Breer
5,An excellent history of the Christian Bible,"This is the best single text that I've read dealing with the manner in which the Bible took its shape. So many Christians have the impression that our Bible floated down from the clouds. This book will open the eyes of many--the New Testament Canon wasn't firmly decided upon until nearly three hundred years after the death of Christ (!). This is an excellent piece of scholarship, doctrine, and church history. Not only will readers learn about the Bible, they will also learn about some great theologians of the early Church. A must read for Roman Catholics, Orthodox, Anglicans, Evangelicals and everyone else who wants to understand the Bible and the ancient Christian Church. Inter Varsity Press publishes this book: I've been very impressed by many of the scholarly books they have recently published on doctrine (several books by N.T. Wright) and the ancient catholic Church Fathers (Ancient Christian Commentary on the Scriptures series)."
1,Poorly produced,The production values were very weak. The spoken section at the beginning was stiff. The background music was bad and the audio of the massage ssection sounded like the speaker was inside a can - very poor acoustics. I regret purchasing this video.
3,Too religious for my tastes,"Now, I have been called one of the biggest Dylan fans of all time, but this album just doesn't do it for me. I love Covenant Woman,& What Can I Do For You. All the others are too preachy for me. It makes me feel like I have a Jehova's Witness at my door telling me about the ways of the Lord, which isn't what this Dylan fan expects from her man Bob. But Bob went through his born-again phase, and he chose to make an album about it. It isn't a bad album by all means, just one for the religious type Dylan fan."
2,I have had this album for 26years,"On LP and recently purchased it on CD only to realise why I don't listen to it its Flat. Don't get me wrong I love Dylans music, he is the only musician whose's concert I went to In good old Sydney in 1977 I think. His singing is as good as any the notes are clear but is it missing that range of feeling and expression that he can produce. He is putting his soul into the album instead of giving to the audience. Slow Train Coming and The Times They Are a Changing, are my all time favourite albums."
3,Preach to the Preacher,"Any Bob Dylan album is worth adding to your collection but...this album make take some getting used to for the seasoned Dylan listener. This period, 1980s, was when Bob dabbled heavily in Christianity (and you can feel it in his music.) His earlier albums discussed love, relationships amd other personal matters of the heart are all about self-awareness...I feel this album captures his new awareness of what he felt was the larger picture. Throughout this album Dylan-esque metaphors for the comfort he has found in his religion are contiunally dropped for your listening enjoyment. A good album - but no Highway 61. For fun with this album, make a drinking game where you listen to Saved and drink every time you hear a religious reference."
2,If you want to Save something...make it your money.,"Alright, I love Dylan's music. Back during the beginning of the CD craze I bought every cassette that I could find with Dylan's name on it. Unfortunately, this was one of them. During Mr. Zimmerman's ""born again"" phase he released a trilogy of albums with a strong Christian theme... Slow Train Coming, Saved, and Infidels. Of the three, Saved is the most consistently uninspiring. In fact, I would rate it as one of Dylan's worst albums of all-time. Now that being said...as a Christian Rock album (and, admittedly, I am not fond of this genre of music) I find it more tolerable than most anything else I have come across. Basically, it is a below average album for Dylan, but it truly depends on how one approaches his work during this period of his career. It is not an album for beginners nor casual fans, instead it appeals to the dedicated few or perhaps those whose message it reaches, the fans of rock with a decidedly spiritual bent."
1,4 out of 5 stars? are you serious?,"can it be that people are letting their personal beliefs block the receptors in the brain that signal bad music? ive listened to many bob dylan albums, and every one is a gem. freewheelin' is my favorite, but so what? it doesn't matter which ones we love, because we all know what bob dylan's worst record was, and its saved. im not one to question this man's beliefs or anything like that, bob dylan deserves all the respect in the universe, but could it be that bob dylan made a transfer to christian music to help us all see how bad it is? could he have made the transfer to make a mockery of the christian faith? almost certainly not. but only a seriously bad album could have planted these seeds in my brain."
1,In the Top 5 worst Dylan albums,"At least Slow Train Coming - for all its bone-headed fundamentalism, near-racism and misogyny - has an attractive steeliness. This 1980 effort, recorded during Dylan's Christian years and before he found a new hobby (embroidery perhaps?), is about as enjoyable as a double bill of Harry Secombe's Highway.Sample lyric: ""When destruction cometh swiftly/And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well/Have you decided whether you want to be/In heaven or in hell?"" Well Bob, that depends which is going to be full of sanctimonious old hippies."
1,"Worth the price, in a sense","If you're buying this, you've probably already drained Dylan down to the dregs. Saved makes Self Portrait look like Highway 61 Revisited. As music or poetry or whatever one usually enjoys in Dylan, it's certainly not worth the vinyl it's recorded on. But as biography and especially as a joke, it's just about worth the retail price. I bought the cassette and have never begrudged the money I shelled out, since the album is always good for a laugh."
3,Much respect,"I think bob is a great song-writer not always big on his singing, but his lyrics are well thoughtout. This album is another example of his song-writing side. It is also more rocking then some of his other albums."
5,Saved,"Saved being Dylan's 1980 release is a very good record. Dylan sings with conviction in his faith and most of the songs lyrics deal with his personal faith. Songs such as Saved, In the Garden and Saving Grace are some really nice tracks. The cover art is quite ok but nothing special. The photo on the back is quite nice. Overall I give this album 4/5!"
5,This is a great Dylan album,"Sure, this is an African-American inspired Christian devotional music album, by a temporarily born-again-Christian, Ukrainian-Jewish-American, from Minnesota, who came to fame in the Amercian folk revival of the early 60s in New York City, produced by a Jewish atheist. Get over it! This is great music, easily one of Dylan's best albums. This album rocks, and it has soul, which is not surprising given it was produced by Jerry Wexler. Looking back now it is hard to believe Dylan was so criticised for this album. Everyone who loves good music should get this album and raise a collective finger to Rolling Stone Magazine and their ilk."
4,A few gems on what is probably the least heard Dylan album - ever,"Great raw band material, musically, not unlike Joe Cocker / Leon Russell.Too bad, much of the Dylan ""spiritual"" era was panned so readily & harshly by critics in the 80s. So many fans were told that there was an either/or choice that had to be made. Yet, this material dovetails very nicely with Dylans older music. Though, he extends and develops in much more detail, the Biblical imagery, themes of justice, etc that were present in is earliest music to ones of redemption & life application of Chrisianity.Few people can write with such lyrical density & fire as Dylan, and that is still true here."
4,Good Dylan . . . Good Christian Music,I was unaware that Dylan had made Christian albums back in his heyday so once I heard of this CD I had to check it out. It is very good. Not the best Bob Dylan album that you will find but even when he is not at his best he is better than almost any Christian music out there today. Very worthwhile.
3,"Not a disaster, but not bad","Hey I first listened to this recently after reading years of bagging reviews from all around the world. It is actually a fairly decent record and there a few good Dylan tracks here - Saved, Solid Rock and In The Garden.This is a not a 5 star album nor is it worth 1 star. It is neither great nor bad.It is worth a listen to try to understand why so many critics bag it."
3,good solid bob,If you like Bob These gospel records are not to be missed.Nice stripped down recording and the band sounds good.Some very good songs here.
4,a saved bob Dylan,The album is awesome the clarity is not clear and very snowy. I would diffentately recommend it if only for the message
4,"SAVED, by Bob Dylan - IF YOU LOVE BOB :)","I bought this for my husband and he enjoys its. Im not that big of a Dylan fan, but the title song is inspiring and upbeat. Great for Dylan collectors and folks who like some folk rock gospel."
4,Love it but not representative.,"I bought this album on vinyl as soon as it came out in 1980 and it's been an enduring favorite in my collection. I own and enjoy several other Dylan albums but this is my fav. That said, don't buy this album if you're a fan of Bob from outside his ""Christian phase"". It's simply not representative of his larger body of work. Getting back to the album, I find it to be an amazing, high energy, in-your-face, live-off-the-floor, rock and roll gospel album with a few quiet, introspective moments. This is rock getting back to it's gospel/blues roots and the band is obviously having a blast. Imagine yourself in a black Pentecostal church led by James Brown with his band in a rockin' frenzy and the congregation dancing in the aisles. That is this album. If you've been waiting to hear that ""ultimate"" gospel album, this is it."
1,"Tedious, boring, contrived","I had heard S.J. Perelman's name so often that I was interested to see how he wrote. Unfortunately, this book was so boring that I couldn't even read it, and it wasn't because of the topic, but because of the writing style, the contrived descriptions, and weak attempts at humor.I have seen other reviewers say they loved it and laughed out loud, and this is a reminder that everyone's experience with humor and writing is subjective.I didn't like it at all; you'll have to judge for yourself."
1,An Unpleasant First Encounter,"An acquaintance recently recommended S.J. Perelman to me as a source of humor. Having read ""Acres and Pains"" today, I came away with but one feeling. To wit: What a horrible waste of my time. I have already purchased two other offerings by Mr. Perelman and can only hope that they are an improvement."
2,Great Music poor visual,"The sound is ahead of the picture, and while it is very slight, those of us (probably not too many) who are bothered by that will find this difficult to watch. Musically, in lyric sections, Kremer has a tendency to let the sound die in a very predictable and non-singing style. Lastly, since it is a dvd....seeing Gidon Kremer in so many closeups with his mouth hanging open (even if his teeth would be perfect) is not an experience I want to revisit very often."
5,Wonderful glimpse of a moment in time for one soldier,"The letter's were mostly addressed to his girlfriend and parents, but it shows the transition from a midwest college boy to a man who is fighting for his buddies from very different backgrounds as much as his country.A front-line soldier, Sgt. Paul seemed to use the letters to and from loved ones as a small respite from what was happening around him.A short, compelling read for anyone wanting to know what soldiers are thinking when they're not fighting. Highly recommended."
3,More talking than music,"This Romeo and Juliet has always been one of my favourite movies, so I was thrilled when I found this CD. But, upon playing it I came to find that there is very few songs on the CD that are not covered up by dialogue- good if you want to hear the movie recited to you, not so good if you got the CD simply for thw music- it's usually covered up. Neat to listen to but don't buy it for the music!"
5,If you love the movie,"If you love the movie, the soundtrack will evoke images of the scenes. This is really some beautiful music...."
1,Memory fades and so does my liking for this album,"I remembered the one song from this album. What I did not remember from so long ago is that it is the ONLY song on the album. The rest is dialog. BORING! I felt like I wasted my money on this one, but if you enjoy listening to Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey waxing eloquent with Shakespeare, then this is the album for you. But, maybe you'd be better served by buying the DVD. At least you get to see the whole spectacle, which my memory seems to remember was quite good...at the time."
5,BETTER!!!!!,In School we had to wach this movie. THis movie makes better sense and has a lot more to look at other than the high tech fireworks and stuff in the newer version with Leonard Decaprio. This has a lot more advance thinking and focauses in on one story!!!!! THE THEME FOR THE MOVIE IS THE BEST!!!
2,Not What I wanted (exactly),"I guess I should have listened to the tracks before ordering. I didn't know dialogue from the movie would be included with the music. If I had realized that, I would not have ordered the CD. I get the same thing with the movie. I was hoping for just the music, as I thought much of it was very beautiful. Oh well, Goodwill will be getting another donation from me."
1,Feeling betrayed.,"There is not a lot to say about this, this, whatever you choose to call this. This is a true disappoinment. I was not a big fan of this group to begin with and this performance insured that I will never become one. Terrible vocals, and an all around bad performance."
3,Not their best,"I love the Crowes, but this record is far from a representation of them at their best.Not worth the money. No one in the band really does anything particularly impressive. Song choice is lame. Very Little jamming."
3,"Great performances, Lousy recording","This sounds like it must have been great to see these performances. I say ""sounds like"" because the recording quality is so poor you can't tell for sure. It sounds like it was recorded through two tin cans and a string. If you've heard the live cuts from ""Sho' Enough"" or with Jimmy Page you know that the Black Crowes are capable of producing great sounding live recordings. This just isn't one of them. I won't bicker about song selections or the pasting together of different performances. Hell, the remake of the Allman Brothers ""Live at the Fillmore"" used different performances in the same song, let alone recording, and it worked. This doesn't."
2,too bad it's live,"I've been searching for a GOOD live recording of the Crowes, and except for Live at the Greek with Jimmy Page, it doesn't exist. The problem is that, despite what others have written, the Crowes simply are NOT a good live band. Sure they have the stage presence, the rock-star swagger, attitude, a solid library of studio work. But it all falls apart in the live audio mix. I have been to many Crowes concerts, and the only good-sounding shows were on the Jimmy Page tour. I had hoped they would have learned something from Page, but this double-live disc is evidence that they have not! Too bad, they're one of my favorite bands ever, I crank up their studio CDs often, but have yet to hear any live recording that does the band, and the music, justice."
1,GET A LIFE!,Contrived vacuity and forgetable monotony -- with a condescending attitude. Don't bother.
2,Very Good...when it is working,"I bought what I thought it was the best shaver I've ever had, until just 7 months after the purchase, the batteries didn't charge anymore. As I don't live in US, I tried to buy them over the internet but nobody sells them, as you have to send the product to a service center to have the batteries replaced. For my surprise, I'd have to send to a service center in US (just 2 in the whole country) as no service center in my country was able to change this so ""special"" batteries.I'll sent my new shaver to a ""razor junkyard""..."
1,fell apart,"I have written to the seller and to amazon to see if someone will help my 85 year old dad. This had a 90 day warrantly. I ordered it on Dec. 15, 2005. it was delievered around the 19 or 20, which means we are talking DAYS only of expiration. When you deal with elderly people they can get confused as to when it fell apart, but it sounds like it has been awhile. At least a week or two. This is a $100.00 product and I purchased it for the glorified comments (except the last one which I suspect is the real truth.DO NOT buy this object until you find out how responsive they are to me. I will keep you advised. I expect a return of a new razor or I can send it and have it repaired. I will be fair. I expect the seller to be as well."
3,"Not ""all that""","For once I'd love an electric razor that would give me a close shave and do it in less time than a non-electric. Well, this does half the trick. In some areas of the face, this razor does fine, but in other areas, it performs pitifully. Especially if you have tough stubble under your chin and on your throat area. I can run this razor over that area of my face and it might not cut anything. Mach 3 is still by far the best razor for shaving. This was a big dissapoinment."
3,seems ok,"i had all this years Norelco product, but i wanted to change the comapny to see how they make any difference. Looking at this product using for about a month or so, I am not so thrilled about what is said , only thing this shaver does not allow you to shave if your batteries are dead and you have plugged in the wall to use it,I had no problem with Norelco products while plugged in the outlet and it will let you shave, you have to be sure that there is charge to shave, Also I noticed that the battery does not last 5 days for regular shaving time which is listed as 3 to 5 min, so the charge on this battery is not enough for what it is said in the manual."
5,Best Electric Shave Yet,This is the best I've ever used. Shaves very close. Very Quiet. And super easy to clean because you can just rinse it with water. Also charges fast. And the replacement foil/blade combo is cheap too. Oh and it's an awesome deal to boot.
4,Works well,"Shaves closer than my 8 year old Remington which recently died. Also get some whiskers which the Remington never could but occasionally misses some. Battery is quick to charge and the charging indicator is handy, but battery life seems short. It only goes about 5 days between charges whereas the Remington lasted 2 weeks."
4,Nice Shaver,"This is a nice shaver. The price is right. I have only used it as a dry shaver, but it is also good for wet shaving."
2,It's ok,"It's an Ok shaver (if your beard is not as thick as mine). You might find it a little annoying when you try to shave the neck area because in my case i need to make 2-3 passes till all hair leaves. When i bought it i thought that it was coming with a trimmer because i don't like shaving completely as my skin irritates very easy, so i have to give it to my cousin who had exactly the same problems as mine."
5,Exceeds Expectations,"Have been using a Braun 7526 and before that a high end Norelco. Right out of the box the ES8152NC has given me a close shave. It's quiet, well-built and versatile. The ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream is great. I also like the fact that it's easy to clean with soap and water instead of a gimmicky auto-cleaning base (i.e. Braun). So far, I love using it."
1,disappointed,"I was looking forward to the convenience of an electric shaver, but find this razor to be anything but convenient. It takes forever to get anything even resembling a close shave, especially on my neck. Typically, I have to go over my neck with my old manual razor. If anybody is seriously thinking about buying this razor, contact me and I'll sell you mine for cheap."
4,"A very close shave, but it takes a few passes","This is quite simply the best shaver I have owned. It gives me a shave that is as smooth as a razor shave without the nicks and constant replacement of blades. I have also owned Norelco and Remington electric shavers, and although I used the Norelco for a number of years, it never performed as well as this product.The only downside I have discovered is that it can take several passes to get a shave that feels very smooth. The first pass makes me look respectably shaved, however, so a two-minute shave is not out of the question when I'm in a hurry."
4,Very good but not yet there compared with a blade,"Many years ago I tried an electric shaver, Was crap and I stuck with a blade. Many brands of disposable shavers do a good job.Out of curiousity I decided to give this one a shot. I was impressed with the technology.Pros; Electrics have come a long way. I CAN get a close shave with this although it takes a bit of time of smoothing and reshaving. Easy to clean, ergonomic, nice design.Cons; can miss that single hair or 2 or area that ruins the rest of the smothness. Base is a bit flimsy. Can take a bit of time and patience trying to replicate a blades closeness. Admittedly I have a heavy coarse beard and others may not have the same concerns.Overall; I am happy with it."
5,Excellent Value for the Money,"This razor is much, much better in features and maintenance than my Braun.One of the things I liked with this razor is that the clean-up is easy and I don't have to buy refills for the job (unlike Braun which performs cleaning with a cleaning cartridge that needs to be replaced periodically). And I don't have to hesitate in getting it wet.Another is the price - $60 A comparable Braun for this price does not have as many features..The design is also excellent: Ergonomic power plug, charging base that keeps the razor upright at all times.Downside?I'm not sure what the hi-speed feature is for. It does clean the razor any better than the normal speed."
4,Great Shaver !!,"This is probably one of the best shavers that I've owned in recent memory. Very close, smooth shave. Easy cleanup. Seems to be very powerful, with the 13,000 rpm linear motor. My only complaint hence the 4 star out of 5 rating is there isn't a switch lock for traveling pruposes. The button may be easily bumped in a shave kit, & unless you bring the re-charging unit you may find a shaver that's out of juice...This could be a BIG problem early in the morning...Just remember to bring the re-charger on any trips out of town..."
3,Terrible cusomer service,"The razor works OK. I've always shaved with a safety razor and I've never found an electric razor that shaves as close or as quickly. The Panasonic is no exception. It does fit and move to the contour of my face well. After using it for about 4 months, a piece of plastic that holds the shaver head broke. I sent it to the Panasonic repair facility in San Francisco. After a month, I received a letter from them that the part needed was not in their inventory and that they had to order it from Japan. I expect better from a company like Panasonic."
3,While beautiful looking.....,"This shaver is pricey and is quiet, gentle, and ergonomic. That being said, the shaver falls short in its performance especially with a tough beard. It is extremely slow (not unlike the rotaries) and despite the time investment with frequent back and forth or eliptical movements, the closeness is greatly lacking. The pop-up trimmer is basically worthless and when opened and used will shower you with fine beard clippings. It simply doesn't perform.Panansonic makes quality electronics and appliances, but unless you plan on buying this for its sleek high tech look, save your money. Get a quicker closer shave from a Remington."
2,Good while it lasts,"I had this shaver for a little under 18 months and it did a reasonable job in that time. I would slide its gently buzzing body over my face for a few minutes in the shower then ""mop up"" the stray remaining hairs with a hand razor. It would take a little longer than a manual but wouldn't scratch as much. However the reason I can't reccommend purchase is it started having charging problems after a little more than a year and soon wouldn't work at all. For a $100 shaver this is just not good enough; I will not buy another Panasonic."
3,Not the greatest for a thick beard,"I bought this for my husband as a replacement for a cheaper ($40) Panasonic wet/dry shaver he used for over a year with no problems. While he likes the pivot action on this more expensive model, he says the old one actually provided a closer shave. He has dark, coarse, straight hair on his beard and seems to think this shaver is not as good as the last one for his type of hair. The best feature for him is the ability to take it into the shower."
2,Not so good,Bought this unit to shave my head and face and find it does a half way job at best. Even on the face it does a half shave. If you wish to keep your beard and hair down to a can't see look you have to use it everyday and even then you still have a rough touch to the beard. It seems to be made for kids just starting to shave or guys with a very light beard growth. Garage sale item.Good buy for your son's first time shave till he gets a little older.DLR
5,panasonic 8152 shaver,best shaver i've ever used.braun is not even (close).that was unintended.joe ben-nun
1,Beware of stated shipping date,"I ordered this item 7 days ago and although Amazon says it shipped, UPS states it recieved only the electronic shipping order. The Shaver has yet to ship. So, don't expect to recieve this item soon...it takes at least a week to ship even though Amazon states ""usually ships in 24 hours"". Good Luck!"
5,Very good shaver,"This is a real nice shaver, I enjoyed it very much though it's a little big and heavy. It shaves very close to skin, done its job seamlessly. Highly recommend."
4,Smooth Shaver:,"I am an addicted/reliable panasonic user. I haven't tried other makes becoz I like to stay with linear shavers and I liked panasonic after I used the first one. So my views may be biased.Pros:Smooth shaveCons:Charging base is an unnecessary component.As for as the charging base concerned, one of the previous panasonic shavers ES7006 featured an excellent wall mountable design which I liked but the similar designs are not in the market now."
2,Quite a disappointment,"I bought Panasonic ES8152NC foil shaver about 6 monthes ago.First three months or so I was very happy with the unit. But gradually the shaving quality went down, foil has been loosing its sharpness and battery capacity greatly diminished. I am going to throw it out, for even if I buy a new foil ($39.95) it would not solve my battery problems.Just my opinion. -LR-"
2,"ok, if you dont mind how loud it is","i usually dont like using electric shavers because they usually miss spots, no matter how many times you go over them. this panasonic has that same problem i ve had with previous electric shavers.the main thing that i find very disturbing is how loud this shaver is. i m not sure if its just me, but it seems like i m sticking a lawn mower into my ear everytime i shave."
5,good stuff,"this razor is better than the product at 2-3x the price. while panasonic makes terrible cordless phones, they make good elect razors"
5,"Great product, highly recommended",This is an excellent product. Shaves very close with no razor 'burn'. Charges quickly and cleans easily - I foresee years of use out of this razor.
3,Strength in Numbers,"In A Color of His Own, the narrator suffers from an identity crisis. He laments that all other animals have their own color, yet chameleons change color wherever they go. Heavily burdened by his color shifting, he seeks stability but only finds false hope. Fortunately, the narrator eventually meets another chameleon who conveys to him that there is strength in numbers. If they remain together, then even though their colors will change they will always be alike. Throughout the story, Lionni's brightly colored watercolor narrator wears his heart on his sleeve; he telegraphs his feelings through the position of his eyes, the line of his mouth, and the curl of his tail--making him the very picture of character development from which students can compose thematic statements."
5,A family favorite for 2 generations,"When I was little I LOVED this book. The story is extremely simple, as are the pictures. Not only is the Chameleon's quest for identity resolved, but he makes a friend as well. Cute and sweet, with simple and coloful illustrations.I was delighted that my son loved this book as well. We have been reading it since he was 3, and now at 9, this story still brings comfort and smiles."
5,Great children's book!,My grandson loves when we read this book! He watches intently as it's read to him and he's only four months old.Thank you!
3,"Charming, but colors are wrong and pages are falling out.","Although I like the story and the illustrations, it is really annoying when my three year old nephew is taking issue with the fact that the story reads...""goldfish are red"". He brought me a picture of a correctly colored goldfish and explained the difference between red and gold. Although I am proud of my nephew Jonah, I am pretty ""meh"" about this book. When I brought it into read aloud, the book began falling apart within a week. A hardcover would be sturdier, but I wouldn't invest hardcover money into a book which causes color debates which distract attention from a lovely story."
2,A bit disinformative.,"OK, a lizard can't come up with a consistent color, but when he meets up with an older lizard, they decide to live the rainbow life together. All good and well, except- goldfish are freaking ORANGE, not red!There needs to be a reprint..."
4,A nice book about acceptance and friendship,"A book about a chameleon who has a trait that he considers a ""defect,"" finds a way to remedy it but disappointingly fails at it, but then finds accepts this trait by accepting the help of someone who shares the same problem, who eventually becomes a friend, and with whom has fun with their unique characteristic. A good friendship story to read to 3+ year old. But not to someone who is just learning about colors.Young children might get confused because some of the colors are off. The goldfish are more like orange than red. (And aren't most goldfish orange?) The lemon is more like a yellow green. The black winter night is more like a dark brown. But overall, a good read."
5,Spectacular,"This is one of many beautiful CDs that Eros has, and once you hear one you want to hear more and more. His music is the kind of music that you can hear all the time. This CD is also available in Spanish and It's magnificient too. If you like Luis Miguel, you will enjoy Eros Ramazzotti too. I can't wait to get my hands on his new CD in Italian & Spanish."
3,Ramazzotti - know what you're buying,"I bought this CD because I wanted to learn the language, and in that respect I think it is helping, but I think anyone interested in this should know what type of music they are buying, because the cover can be deceiving. Instead of a hip Italian band like I was expected, I got something that sounds more like the mellow music my parents listen too. These are mushy songs, which, execpt for #4, and #5, I don't particularly have much an apetite for. However, if that's your thing, then go ahead."
5,A great bibliographical resource and more,"What a great read. I found it very helpful to have a great set of references that are organized by topic. This book would be an ideal one for the Kindle--especially if it could be continually updated (the references stop to the year of publication). If you are eager to expand your coaching horizons, I think this is an excellent resource. Also, chapter six is a fabulous model for framing coaching issues. So far, one of my favorite books!"
1,A total disappointment,"I have read several books about coaching and generally enjoy them alot. This book however was a big disappointment. Really it only contains list after list of suggested reading. That is all it is. I would really estimate that no less than 75% of the book is made up of ""Basic library suggestions"". Terrible."
5,More people need Souad Massi,"Ghir Enta alone is worth your money, but this whole album is utterly fantasitc. Some songs are catchy, some are soothing, but they all share her fantastic voice and instrument playing. I'm not even a huge fan of world music. I'm more of a metal and electronic person, but the first time I heard Souad Massi I was hooked. You will be too."
5,beautiful,"I heard this reviewed on NPR and immediately knew I wanted it. Even though I don't know what she's singing about most of the time, her passion is universal.This is great music to do it to."
5,World Class,"As Deb already is getting the credit it deserves I don't have much to add, except that it was one of the most outstanding musical discoveries I made last year, her concert here in Barcelona was a little bit disappointing to me, but Deb is world class, absolutely!"
5,Magnificent & Fascinating,"(The Kindle edition does not have any font or print issues, as another reviewer complained about.) A fascinating, unbiased exploration of the historical bases for the Christmas traditions, whether originating in pagan practices or in Christian-superimposed-on-pagan traditions (like 25 December being not only the date of the Roman Saturnalia, the celebration of the God Saturn, but also the supposed birthdate of Persian God Mithras, whose cult -highly popular with Roman soldiers at time of Jesus of Nazareth & which included communal meals among men only - was a serious contender for believers when Christianity was a fledgling religion/cult). Brave exploration. Well documented. Fascinating reading. Will make you rethink everything you were ever taught or told about ""Christ-mas(s)"". Excellent reference book."
5,Great dvd!,"My son is watching this dvd as I type this. He absolutely LOVES it. My son is 2 1/2 and he likes all things Elmo! So I figured I'd get him this dvd so he can better understand his morning routine. It teaches kids all about getting dressed, brushing their teeth etc. It has fun songs that the kids can sing along to. I recommend to anyone who has a child in their life that loves Elmo!"
5,A Great Buy,"I absolutely love this dvd. It is one of my most favorite Elmo's World, very cute and entertaining. My favorite Elmo's World movies are: 1) Families, Mail and Bath time 2) Food, Water and Exercise 3) Wake Up With Elmo. Check them out, they're worth your time and money."
5,A Good one for Elmo fans...,"My daughter cannot get enough of Elmo...whether it is video, books, stuffed toys, you name it she loves it (so just based on her reaction it is a must have). I don't mind Elmo...many of his segments on getting dressed and reading etc. have been developmentally positive on my child. This DVD would be among those!! Shortly after she started watching this particular DVD she was much better about brushing her teeth AND became more independent about getting dressed. Based on this I would recommend this video."
4,ELMO WAKES UP YOUR LITTLE ONES,"We just bought this tape for our two year old and it's become one of his favorites. In this nearly hour long tape, Elmo, along with Mr. Noodle's brother teaches kids about sleeping. Elmo finds out what animals sleep and how they sleep including his fish dorothy.Then we move on to getting dressed in the morning. The original Mr. Noodle, played by Bill Irwin, demonstrates how to put on a shirt. The shirt keeps rolling up and hitting him in the face.Finally it's time for Elmo to Brush his teeth as Mr. Noodle shows how to squeeze the toothpasted onto the toothbrush. There's also a video showing a boys first trip to the dentist.A good tape, although this one didn't hold his interest quite as much as some of the other Elmo tapes and DVDs my son has but it's still fun."
1,waste of money,I was very disappointed with this tape. My daughter loves Elmo so I thought this was a movie about elmo's morning but it turned out that it was a movie about different people and kids and their routines in the morning not the cartoon I imagined. I have actually tossed the tape away because I though it was a waste.
1,Annoying,"Although the topics of the video are important, the delivery of the video is lacking. I find the vidoe annoying and it doesn't keep my child's attention. Some muppets\Sesame Street video's are excellent (like Bert and Ernies Word Play), however this was unimaginative and looks like it created [low buget]. I was very disappointed with this purchase and I unfortunately would not recommend it."
4,Straight Shot,"Blomberg wrote an excellent book. This book is a careful study of the context, life and times of Jesus in the first century. This book is not 'light reading,' and probably needs to be done when you are fully engaged. With that said, it will put you in a different zone in your knowledge of the first century and the Gospels than before you read it. JVD"
4,Great resource,"This book is being used as a text for an on line Life Of Christ class. It continually exceeds other class resources in depth and scope of information. Mr. Blomberg is open to alternative interpretations of questionable historical markers, is seldon dogmatic, but keeps the main thing the main thing. Be prepared to take lots of notes to ensure you catch all the direction changes as he presents differing interpretations of the same event/information. Great use of sources old and new.The construction of the book is less than stellar. I am only two weeks into the class and back cover has totally seperated from the binding. A little duct tape does wonders. As I said, this is an online class so the book is not hard travelled or misused to account for the damage."

5,It's the BEST!!!,"I love my Whirley-Pop! It's so easy and fast to use. I never burn popcorn anymore or have burnt oil in my pans. It's so much healthier to pop your own corn than to buy the microwavable!! We love it and use it 3-5 times a week or more!! Great buy, too! Thanks, Amazon.com!!"
4,"Pops well, Easy to Clean","The Whirley-Pop is a well made popper, and has been very easy to clean after use with just a wipe of a paper towel. However, I find the lid tends to fall off when emptying, despite trying to bend the clasps (not easy), so I have taken to removing the lid entirely rather than trying to empty the popper with the lid attached; just seems easier to empty using hot pads than using the handle. Also, I wish it were a bit larger for bigger batches; I need to pop 2 batches to get enough. Overall, I give the Whirley-Pop a grade of ""B""."
5,Yummy popcorn,This popper is great. It has exceeded my expectations. Easy to use and makes great popcorn. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try.
4,Great popcorn popper!,"Very easy to use and clean. Makes great-tasting popcorn in a very short time. Tastes much better than microwave. Pop, then spray with a little olive oil and add salt. Leftovers stay fresh and crunchy if kept in a ziplock bag."
3,Whirley-Pop Theater Gift Set with Stovetop Popcorn Popper,"I love this popper great popped corn Every kernel pops up light and fluffy.con plastic gears that are showing wear after about 75 usesI saw this in another review if its true its a 5 star company ""Give the Wabash people a call. They will ask you when you bought the popper and they will register your product. Then they will send you a brand new lid no questions asked. They will continue to do this for the next 25 years. I wish the entire gear system was made of metal, but with impeccable customer service like Wabash provides"""
1,Not worth two cents,"Yuck! It did not do the job. My popcorn tasted like rubber! I tried different popcorn, and they all tasted bad!"
5,great popper,"this makes really good popcorn. i use it with kid gloves since i read some reviews that say the gears break easily. once i start getting resistance i go counter-clock wise and then clock wise again. the resistance means that most of the popcorn is popped and it is getting towards the top. i also called and registered it when i got it and was told that it had a 25 year warranty. the popcorn that comes with it is really good too and almost every kernel pops, even the store brand."
2,A better method...,"Cover the bottom of a non-stick 5 qt. stockpot with olive oil -- the more the tastier.Turn gas flame to high. (If using electric, don't go above medium high).Add popcorn.Cover, with lid slightly askew so that the popped corn doesn't steam and get soggy.WALK AWAY. (OK, put on oven mitts and swirl it around every 4 or 5 minutes if it makes you feel better, but it's really not necessary.)When popping slows to 3 or 4 seconds between pops, remove from heat, salt, and pour into serving bowls.Pretty flawless in my experience: few un-popped kernels; no burned ones; easy clean up; and no need to stand there and tend it."
2,Jacquelyn R Easton,I ordered a Red Whirley Popcorn Popper and a conventional Whirley Popcorn Popper at the same time. I received both at the same time. The Red Whirley Popcorn Popper bottom of the pan was damaged. I contacted you (Amazon) and recieved a postage return label to return the red coated popper for exchange. Which I did and I received a conventional coated popcorn popper in its place.I never received the Red Whirley Popcorn Popper that I ordered.Jacquelyn Easton
2,It won't last.,"I have owned 2 Whirley-Pop popcorn poppers. Neither lasted more than a year. While it worked, I loved the popcorn. I detest microwave popcorn and much prefer home-made. The Whirley-Pop worked great...while it worked. The problem I experienced with both was that after a while, the small wire arms inside the pot no longer ""whirled"". Then the little plastic gear on top of the lid would break. Without that it is just another (very) lightweight pot."
5,You'll never eat that microwave stuff again!,"Never a moment's trouble with this product... easy to use, simple to clean, just follow the directions that come with the popper and you'll make great popcorn every time. We buy our popcorn at a local Amish store (it's called Lady Finger popcorn)and it pops up small and tender - nothing like that microwave junk (which no one in my household will even eat anymore). I've purchased a number of these as gifts and will continue to as long as they are available. Highly recommended product!"
5,"Tough steel makes crunchy, fluffy popcorn!",Delicious popcorn comes from this pot. Throw away that chemical microwave poison and use this!
2,Nice idea cheaply made. My old one was better.,I bought this popper and it is too flimsy to be usable. My previous one was stainless steel and much better. These gears are plastic and slip when corn is almost fully popped. The inside part rubs on the bottom of the pan. The unit is much to cheaply made to recommend.
2,Disappointed,"Bought this as a gift for myself. Turned out to be a cheap, lightweight pot that began to burn popcorn after only a few uses. Then the lid began to come off during popping, and the stirrer wouldn't stay level to move the kernels around. Finally threw it away last night, after less than a year. Very disappointed in the quality of this item. Will buy a different brand next time."
2,"Decent popper, but poor quality parts","I've had this popper for about three months now, and about a week ago, the plastic gears broke. They split in half.While I had it, it made decent popcorn, and it was a lot of fun to make it at home. However, the quality of parts isn't worth your money. I'd suggest finding something with all metal parts."
3,Good CD,"The music is good, Connie Smith wonderful voice is as it always was, wording is good. I only wish I could get Connie Smith's own music on CD. That's not to say Nat Stuckey isn't good, but I only wanted Connie Smith's songs. I used to listen to her music from some dubbing I had copied from my sister's LPs. I only heard of Nat Stuckey for the first time on this CD."
5,Connie Smith/Nat Stuckey,"Connie Smith has always touched my heart with her testimony and singing. I have admired her and her life for many years.. This CD with Nat Stuckey is the greatest. I have given it to several to my friends.The first song ""God Will"" is my most favorite - second is""Whispering Hope""."
4,Great Harmony,"I originally bought this CD for my mother who had heard it on XM Radio. She really enjoys their harmony in the song ""Whispering Hope"". It is an old beautiful hymn, not heard much anymore. If you like country music and older religious music, it is a good CD."
3,sadly to date his best work,"Hello, Still his best work. It's easy to see the music coming together and understanding why after nearly 20yrs he just can't top the Inventor."
