3,"Lovely Ibead, but core metal is soft","I also have a non-silver bracelet and spacers in addition to a few beads that have silver cores; the core of this bead is the only thing on my wrist that's showing signs of wear. It's still pretty and I like it too much to not wear it, but I've worn it less than a week and the core edges already have that slightly ""chewed"" look."
4,roses and vanilla = romance,"As avant garde as some of his fashions, the bottle designer Jean Paul Gaultier created for his signature fragrance is a stand-out. Then, with a so-who-cares bow to the accepted he presented his Mae West shaped bottle in a tin can. Women loved it, and men did, too.It brings smiles to faces when they see it on a dressing table. And, most importantly, the fragrance is delightful - a heady but not intrusive blend of roses and vanilla."
4,A STATE OF THE ART SCENT,"As avant garde as some of his fashions, the bottle designer Jean Paul Gaultier created for his signature fragrance is a stand-out. Then, with a so-who-cares bow to the accepted he presented his Mae West shaped bottle in a tin can. Women loved it, and men did, too.It brings smiles to faces when they see it on a dressing table. And, most importantly, the fragrance is delightful - a heady but not intrusive blend of roses and vanilla."
1,Fooled by 5 star rating,Once I saw all the 5 star ratings for this book and read the premise I had to buy it. It was difficult to finish since the lust/love story was so boring. It would have been a lot more interesting if the plot didn't have these characters ready to tear each others close off but their first meeting and each one thereafter. A much better contemporary romance/suspense is Heartbreaker by Julie Garwood.
2,Can't get worked up about it.,"The author turned me off this book in the first few pages, when the lead character, Lili, reacts to the stress of an attempted kidnapping by coming on to her brand new bodyguard, rubbing her body against his to see if he'll react. Excuse me? All I could think was: what kind of promiscuous idiot does that? Throughout the rest of the book, I couldn't shake the feeling of being sorry for the bodyguard, Matt, for ending up with her. I don't think this author writes women well. Her character Matt was okay, but Lili? Even after this beginning, when things could only get better, you never really get a feel for her. And even when the author writes from a woman's point of view, she sounds like a man. Hint: when writing a romance, don't describe the blunt physicality of making love. This book was vaguely interesting because of the bit of mystery involving gangsters and a collectible pair of shoes (that's unique) but the romance? 373 pages and I'm sure glad it's over."
3,"Not quite 4 stars, but more than 3!","I purchased this because it was on my recomendations. I found it to be a fun and entertaining read.This book did not make it to my keeper collection, but I will read other books from this author. I hate it when authors guess about something because it sounds good. For instance, when the heroine asks to see her bodyguards gun. He hands it to her and checks the safety and then warns her after taking the clip out that there is still a round in the chamber. 2 Major problems, no one trained in guns ever hands over a weapon w/ammunition in it, espcecially a round chambered, and 2 Glocks do not have safetys. The only safety is that the trigger has to be pulled.After reading that it was harder for me to by his professionalism, and this is where it lost me a bit.Very original and refreshing storyline. Good way to pass the time. I would recommend reading it."
3,A decent read,"I have to confess that the only reason that got Her Bodyguard was it was one the of the books that recommenned to me. It was an okay read, but Lili character seem a bit unbelievible to me. As a reader, I couldn't relate the character and I think that is important in order for the reader to enjoy a book. I read Her Bodyguard but its not a book that I will be keeping."
3,"Not bad, the story within the story really helped","I'd give this book 3.5 stars if they had it. The story within the story was good, but sorry, Lili was a bit over the top and I really didn't see the sparks. Worth a read, but I think I'd try to find it used or at the library instead of paying full price."
5,Still amazing despite differences,"Despite its suttle differences from the movie it is very fun to read. It is the ORIGINAL screenplay, that's why it is somewhat different from the movie. It is very intersting to get the writers original thoughts of the movie in book form. It is espically nice for those of us waiting for the video to come out though it lacks the impact of the movie."
5,"La vita e' bella, the Benigni style of life.","I'm italian and I know almost all Benigni movies. Well, as Oscars says, ""La Vita e' bella"" is the most brillant, extraordinary, piece of art that shows the genius behind this fanatastic person. I encourage all of you to see also other movies he did. Every title has something very particular and one phrase is wrote in every image he does: it's his style of life: Life is wonderful.This is absolutely a cult for the human community. (sorry for my poor english :-)"
5,Very close - if not the best movie I have ever seen!,"What more can I say? You see this movie, read the screenplay, and you say, ""What more could I want?"" It's funny, touching, romantic, then alternately sad, heartwrenching, and inspiring. You walk away thinking, ""Could I ever have as much strength and love for family as that man?"" True self sacrifice, real love. This film is BEAUTIFUL."
4,Great book!,"Although it wouldn't have ever happened, I like the message of this book. What a great dad! This book was sometimes hard to follow. I liked it, but it was hard to get into."
5,Love is the source of life even in the bleakest times.,This story has inspired me in ways I never imagined! In a world filled to the brim with hate and sadness it is refreshing to read and see something to restore my faith in humanity. This story proves that love and laughter will sustanin the soul through the bleakest hours and that there is good to be found in the ugliest realities. The lessons in this story have been written in such a human way. We can all relate to the situations various characters face. I can only hope to embrace love and life as Benigni has. I think that the world will be vastly improved if we take the lessons from the pages and words of Life is Beautiful and apply them to our own lives and situations.
5,Robert Benigni is beautiful!,"I didn't even read the book or see the movie but just reading these reviews and seeing the expression and happieness on Robert's face at the Oscars makes my heart so full of joy for this man, and the story! I hope to read the book soon because it sounds so promising and inspiring! La vita e'bella!!!"
4,"A nice humidifier, but no mist.","The words ""Cool Mist"" are somewhat misleading. This is a wick style humidifier, not an ultrasonic one. Therefore, you don't get mist - you get cool air from a fan: a fan that is not silent either.Even on the smallest setting ""Quite Mist"" you can hear it. Whether or not it is enough to bother you depends on the person. For us, it is tollerable - just, although I expected it to be more quite than it is.We bought two: one for own son's room (which is quite small) and one for our room (which, while, larger than our son's, it too, is quite small - 12ft5 X 15ft). It works well in our son's room, but not well in our room. Our room suffers from a cold draft at the moment and having the humidifier set on anything other than HIGH seems to be inadequate.The digital humidity level gauge is a real plus. Overall, we are pleased, but it is louder than we expected at the lowest setting."
3,cool mist,Noisy except on lowest setting-- Filling only lasts about 12 hours on low. Easy to fill and clean.
2,Just not worth it!,"I've been using the humidifier for about 2 weeks now. I use it in a small bedroom and it never increases the humidity of the room. It runs on high all day and never reaches the desired humidity, which isn't much higher than what it reads as the current room humidity. The filters are expensive and it started turning green only after 3 days of use.. so I'm guessing it needs to be changed atleast before 2 weeks. I would look at another brand before buying this humidifier."
1,Promising but problematic,"If you buy this item, open it in a WELL VENTILATED room because otherwise the plastic smell will linger for a LONG time. If you or people near where this item will be used have any sensitivity to strong odors or chemicals, I don't recommend this item. I usually am not bothered by the ""new appliance smell"" but this was too much. I returned it because after a week it still was giving off a strong smell."
3,It is loud!!,"I have been searching QUITE humidifier before purchasing this. The reason that I purchased this model is its ""Quite Mist"" mode was emphasized to be very quite. However it is still loud. I have to turn it off while sleep."
3,Easy to clean but we go thru filters like candy,"I bought this humidifer becasue it was easy to clean, which it is but I find that every time I put a new filter in it takes only 3 or 4 weeks before it start to get a little mildewy and smell a little musty. I realy don't know what to try next. We are on our 4th filter since November and now I can't find them in any store becasue it is a seasonal item and the stores have moved on to summer things."
2,"It's not the WORST, but it's pretty bad","I wish I had seen some of the other reviews on here before purchasing. I bought this humidifier 2 months ago and it is terrible. My latest complaint is that the filters last for about 2 days. That is utterly ridiculous! I don't know what I'm supposed to do, replace it every day? I started being very meticulous about cleaning it and I'm still having the filter problem.My previous complaints were that it is too loud, even on the Quiet Mist setting, but I've gotten used to that noise (high pitched hum). It also does not put out enough moisture. I leave it in a closed room and it barely gets in the 30-percent range. I have another humidifier (non-replaceable filter) that is much more efficient but unfortunately that one is loud as a freight train! Back to square one with the humidifiers! I hate winter!!!"
3,"pretty decent humidifier, yet questionable effect","this is pretty good humidifier. it was really easy to set up and refill water.however, this humidifier made little more noise than what i had expected. but it was acceptable level.and i am not sure if this is only case for me, but i never can get my room humidity above 40%, even if i turn this on (HIGH) all day along! maybe i still need to put wet towels and cactus beside my bed..."
2,A nice unit but too noisy,"I bought this unit based because I liked the idea of digtal control and display, but the fan is somehow too noisy."
2,Disappointing - doesn't work in very dry weather,"We've had this humidifier in my son's room for a year now. While it is quiet and easy to refill, it doesn't fulfill its purpose very well during dry weather.Although it claims to keep a very large area moist, it has not been able to get above 25% in his 15'x15' room this winter. (And we replaced the filter very recently.) As I type this, the outside humidity is 43%, but the humidifier is showing just 25% in my son's room.I haven't tried many others, but so far this humidifier has been a disappointment."
1,Nothing but problems,"I bought this humidifier after my other got a short in one of the connections. I have had nothing but problems from the time I opened the box. This humidifier doesn't humidify anything. My filter is constantly drying out and the humidity levels never go above 30%. I have been trying to get a replacement for this unit, especially after having read all the other experiences. The only thing that Hamilton Beach has done is send me replacement filters. The problem is not getting any better, and my house is full of static electricity. By no means am I condeming the whole Hamilton Beach line, I have many quality products that have been made by them, however, I have found the lemon!"
4,Great performance/buy,I have used this humidifier now for a couple of months and must say that it really does a nice job. I use the quiet mist setting which you can hardly hear at all even if sitting within a few feet. The only thing it doesn't have is an automatic shutoff when it runs dry so I have to make sure that it is full before retiring to bed at night. All you have to do is read the instructions carefully and sit back and enjoy. During the cold winter months the added humidity inside makes my condo very comfortable. I find the prices/stock/delivery system at Amazon excellent.
4,More than my moneys worth.,"I saw this on Amazon several weeks ago but I decided to buy a different brand at a local retailer. I was happy enough with it, but when this came up in my gold box, I decided to go ahead and get it. I am so happy I did! When compared to the Halls brand humidifier, this is so much better! First, it has a very good sized tank that is very easy to fill with a large fill hole. Second; the digital readout is very easy to adjust and read (although the humidity reading at the unit will of course be higher than that from across the room). This is also much quieter than the Halls unit, although on high it is noticable, much like having a fan running, which is what it is! :) But I am not a light sleeper and it does not bother me at all.Why not 5 stars? Well, nothing's perfect! :)"
2,Adequate but problematic,"I have gone through many different humidifiers over the years. This was the last model I had before I made the switch to one with a heating unit that decreases risk of bacteria. I found this model to be a bit too noisy, it required more cleaning than I was interested in, and it was not strong enough to withstand the occasional jolts caused by my two-year-old's curiosity. It did do a pretty good job of keeping a medium-sized room covered by the mist. Overall not worth the money in my opinion."
3,Hmmm...Not As Good as Expected,"Did a lot of research before making this purchase. I like the humistat, it's handy to know exactly the humidity level. However, this unit is quite large and noisy, even on the quiet setting. After running it almost 48 hours straight it raised the humidity in our house from 54% to 65%. I don't know if that's an indication of how dry it was in our house or how long it takes this product to work. We do live in Seattle, so you wouldn't think our air is so dry, but I guess with the heat it is dry indoors. This unit says it's good up to 900' but I think that only if your area has no walls --i.e., it won't work for 2-3 Bedrooms that total 900', it will only work if there's 1 BR or LR or other space that totals 900'. I'm looking for another unit now, one that's quieter and works for a larger space."
3,Good For large Rooms not the bedroom,"This is a very good humidifier. It keeps the humidity at a consistent level and the high setting is good when you want to ""humidify"" quickly. The large tank requires less filing of other smaller humidifiers.The downside is that it is still a bit noisy even onthe quiet setting. Of note I do have the 3.5 gallon tank. Another downside is that it is difficult tell when the humidifier is empty b/c of the smoke colored tank. It would also be nice if it turned off when empty."
2,"Weak scent, bubbles up in humidifier","I am disappointed with this product. In order to get enough of a scent to enjoy, you have to use a lot and that creates too many bubbles when filling my humidifier."
1,Doesn't work,I had a different pest repeller for four years and when I had that one I never saw a bug or mouse. I thought this one would be better because it was more expensive and you can select which pest that it works for. Well since I have had it I saw a roach a few feet away from the unit. I just had to get rid of a bee that was in the same room. We even had a bird that was standing on the porch screen not to far from the unit. I wish that I had bought a different brand.
4,Nice quality,"I really like the extra loop on these sponges. They are much easier to get a grip on. Sometimes those ropes they have around other sponges just swing around my wrist! They only thing I would change is to make the material a little stiffer. Maybe it's the color dye (Lavender) but it seems a little soft to me. All in all, I thought it was a good product."
1,Hello Bees,I bought this product for my dad as a gift. They have a problem with bees outside on their patio. The instructions for this product state that it can be used indoors or outdoors and it would repel bees. We tried it on a very small patio one day and the bees were actually attracted to the product. They were sitting on top of the machine when we had it on in both the silent mode and audible mode. I returned the product and we decided the best alternative to getting rid of the bees is to use fabric softner which is cheaper.
5,LOVE this show!,I really love this TV show and am a huge fan! I spent one whole weekend watching every episode in Season 1 & 2. This show was made back when TV had some good acting and a story with substance.... all are wonderful. I am drowning Sony with requests for the release of the rest of the seasons on DVD. So worth the money!
4,reliving the 70s,"This series stands up pretty well. I remember wanting to be like Kate Lawrence when I was in my 20s and find that I still would like to be Kate Lawrence. The first few episodes are somewhat uncomfortable but when you get into the rhythm of the show it is very gratifying. A couple of episodes dealing with death and loss actually made me cry. All in all, a nice return to the 70s."
5,the best of television,This is compelling viewing of a special sort. The quality of the writing and performances is astonishing.
4,Good memories relived,"I enjoyed the ""Family"" series in the 1970s and was delighted to find it available on DVD. I am currently reliving the memories of the series through episodes of series 1 and 2. I look forward to subsequent releases of the later episodes."
4,So-so.....,"Although I enjoyed watching the show. It was like I remembered it, the quality of some of the disks were not so good. They froze up and I had to skip certain parts of the DVD in order to get the DVD to move on."
3,favorite tv series from the past,I was amazed to find this series (even though I've read that other seasons aren't recorded because of some lawsuit...). But I was thrilled to find it on DVD and received it really promptly and in great shape.
4,Kristy still Cute,"With Kristy McNichol recently coming out as a lesbian I started to remember how cute I thought she was back then. I really started missing her and then saw this product. Perfect. Now I didn't really like this show when it was out because I was about her age and it seemed pretty slow paced and boring but as an adult it really is good drama and Kristy is perfect. I never had a kid sister but if I did I would want it to be her. Also, Meredith Baxter came out recently and is also in the cast. What are the chances? I also had a little crush on her too as a kid. Funny."
4,Excellent show,"Loved this show when it was on and was pleased when it came out on DVD. Have watched all the discs and enjoyed it immensely. There are some slight imperfections on the playing side of the discs that look like fingerprints but will not wipe off. So far, they have not affected the playback. Highly recommended."
5,"Yes, Yes, Yes!!!. Finally!!!!!",I cannot wait to get the DVD for this wonderful show. One of the best shows of the 1970's is finally making his debut on DVD. I hope that all seasons are eventually released.
5,Where's season Three??????,"Where is season three, I can't believe that it hasn't come out yet!!! Will it ever??? I loved this show when it was on TV and went crazy when it came out on DVD. Please release the other seasons."
5,Family Stands The Test Of Time,"This is my all-time favorite series and the issues, writing and acting are as fresh and interesting as they were 30 years ago. I've laughed and cried with the Lawrence family and been glued to my TV for all the episodes on this box set. Come on, Sony! Give us the rest of the series. Episodes ahead deal with Willie's marriage, the Lawrence's adoption of Annie, Buddy's blossom into adulthood and much, much more.If you don't have seasons one and two, buy them. You won't be disappointed! This show is like Chicken Soup for the Soul!"
5,Family! Quality Television!,"Wow! How could I have forgotten about this show? I was a little younger than Buddy when it orginally aired. I used to be so disappointed because it came on right at bed time. I remember lying in bed listening to the theme music. Funny how all my childhood memories come flooding back whenever I hear that theme music! I have been enjoying these DVD's so much. Absolute QUALITY television. It is quite ironic that, these days, we all have 900 channels and frequently cannot find anything worth watching with our families on t.v. There is NO episode poorly written or uninteresting. What has happened to television in the past thirty years...so sad. WE NEED TO GET MORE SEASONS OF THIS PHENOMENAL SHOW RELEASED ON DVD! P.s. Kristy M. was quite the young actress...What ever happened to Sada Thomson???"
4,The Best Family Show EVER,"I grew up watching this show, so when I saw it was out on DVD, I couldn't wait to buy it. This is one of the most well written family shows and I only wish today's TV was a valuable. If you are a child of the 70s-80s I highly recommend this show."
5,welcome memories,This is an old tv show from my viewing past. Brought back great memories. I would like to know if the rest of the seasons will be offered. Would love to have them. Great show!
1,"Bought a set ""NEW"" on Amazon - Factory defects on most of these discs!!!","Yes, I am sure that this was a NEW DVD Set. I bought it on Amazon and found that 5 of the 6 discs had a strange residue (probably some kind of cleaning solvent from manufacturing) which marred the disc surface and prevented reliable playback.Careful and proper cleaning has made two of the marred discs playable, but the other 3 are a lost cause. There are no scratches or any other mechanical defects, just some faint streaky marks which prevent the DVD player from reading the surface. I have tried to read these on a Toshiba, Panasonic and Sony DVD players -- all with no luck.Be sure to check your set as soon as you receive it. Good luck!"
1,Not Recommended For Educators,"I am a gang and youth violence expert working with the San Diego County Office of Education, Safe Schools Unit. I have alerted many of our schools about the series of books by Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams. I do not recommend the purchase of this book. The content of the books are not appropriate for young people. The images of gangs are not accurate (Too much negative sterotyping). The book is written in a simplistic style that will quickly bore young students. Youth need to critically examine information not be talked down to. You may email me for alternate suggestions for gang prevention books for youth."
5,Another Rocky Mountain High,"NIGHT LAWS by Jim Michael Hansen. Kelly Parks is an attorney at Denver's largest law firm where she is warned by a vicious killer tht she is his next target.It is up to Denver homicide detective Bryson Coventry to find out why Parks is a target and exactly what secrets her firm is concealing. Parks realizes she must learn the truth to save her life and to satisfy herself about her possible unwitting participation in a murder. Action in some ways is reminiscent of Grisham's The Firm, i.e., powerful law firm above the law. Talk about a Rocky Mountain high."
1,What's going on?,"I purchased and read Winess Chase by RJ Jagger, a Nick Teffinger novel, a few of which I read and stopped because all the cases were very similar. So, I order this book by Jim Michael Hansen, a Bryson Coventry police procedural, and it is the exact same book with names changed. I saw some small notice on Amazons website, that this was previously published as Witness Chase, but under differt author and character name? Whats the deal? No way for me to get my money back, can't return digital order, and not going to call them for $5.Beware."
2,Different cover art than displayed,"Was very disappointed that the cover art displayed upon ordering wasvery different from the cd that I received. While the songs were allfrom the year 1959, I would have liked the year ""1959"" displayed onthe cover since this was a gift for someone born in that year."
4,Great Material For an ESL Class.,"I use this book in my ESL classes in Japan. It has a lot of great photocopiable material for us artistically challenged language teachers! Aside from the great illustrations it has: mercifully short descriptions of how to conduct each activity, what you need, what the minimum number of students is and a list of key vocabulary that ought to be pre-taught before using the excercise. The exercises are listed by function taught and there's also a pretty good structural and lexical index included. Sometimes, however, the activities in the book might include grammar or vocabulary that your class may not be up to speed on. I've always been able to tweak the material to match my classes, though."
5,Vital Information,"While Johnson recognizes that US military and economic imperialisms are well known throughout much of the rest of the world, their depth and breadth are not at all well known and least of all to the majority of US citizens (especially the military 'empire of bases' Johnson details). No one who reads this fact-packed and meticulously documented account can walk away with the slightest doubt about the matter. Of special note are the many detailed connections shown between the Bush administration and every manner of special energy and private military contracting interest over the last few decades, most of all in Iraq. The book is also very well written--hard to put down. A work, along with Johnson's earlier _Blowback_, of vital importance to every American, especially before the upcoming presidential election. Thank you, Chalmers Johnson, for writing it."
4,Book 2 of Triology,"The Sorrows of Empire continues the discussion & gives much more information relative to the militarism of America's foreign policy. Quite frankly I was appalled to learn the extent to which they've already gone in their effort to colonize the world by building military bases all over it. I must say they've done a good job of keeping the public mostly ignorant of their activities in that regard. The subject of Johnson's books certainly isn't a cheerful one, but I do believe that it's important to be aware of these things, even if we can't have any influence on them."
5,SCARY,"Mr. johnson points out in the beginning of the book that he does not have an optimistic view of our democracy and after reading only about 50 pages I'm scared. I've read or have on my desk most of the current crop of books about this illegal administration and this is the most unsettling of the lot so far. People don't hate us because we're free. They hate us because our government has acted like bullies for a very long time. We get upset because 3000 of our citizens were murdered by zealots but are completely unaware of the millions of people world wide who have been murdered and tortured in our name for the profit of our american corporations. Johnson points out that war has been an abstract concept to most americans until now. We'd better get our act together before some nut sets off a ""nuculer"" bomb in one of our cities.Turn off the damn box and crack open a book and learn more about your world. Our lives depend on it!epistemology: the study of how we know what we know."
1,Recommended by Janeane Garafalo!!,"The back cover of this book has a blurb by one of our great political theorists and commentators on current events, Janeane Garafalo!! Don't waste your time. Johnson see conspiracy and greed behind ever every action in US foreign policy."
3,Too Left,"America is at fault for the 2nd world War. We are at fault for providing security to Japan, korea and Taiwan. Freedom has a price and while the rest of world enjoys freedom, we American pay the price. I am sorry after 100 pages, I think the book is way to left than center."
1,insulting to people with a moderate level of intelligence,"This is without a doubt the worst piece of social science ever produced. Regardless of where you stand politically, Johnson is guilty of revisionist history to the worst degree. Throughout this work Johnson displays a truly and utterly amazing ignorance of geopolitical realities."
5,Scholarly eye opener,If all that is claimed in this book is true we should all be concerned whatever our political persuasion.
3,An Interesting Emphasis,"This book is worth reading for its unique argument that the primary factors causing antipathy towards the United States in the middle East are its military bases. The author has experience in this area and brings it to bear on this topic area quite effectively, particularly with his coverage of the Saudi Arabian and Japanese bases.My only criticism of this book is that I would like to see its many interesting claims referenced, and if possible, with primary sources. It makes the arguments difficult to support when claims can only be justified circularly by appealing to the author's credibility."
5,a book for those who enjoyed Fried Green Tomatoes,"A friend gave me this book to read. Since Lyon is known as a children's author, I wasn't that eager. But when I opened it, I was hooked! I have since recommended it to everyone I know. It's a story of love, anger, and reconciliation. And more, it's a fable about faith; faith in the capacity of humans to forgive and go on. The story is written from the point of view of each of the main characters-a device that makes the reader feel as if you are sitting at the table listening to each person tell his/her version of the story. That the author is able to create five distinct voice is a credit to her ability. I won't go into much about the story except to say that Mawmaw is the most interesting character with her believe in God the Mother, Daughter, and Holy Ghost. I read a great deal and this book has stayed with me more than any in recent times."
1,Not like the other Arco books,"I bought this book ... when I received word from my dad that GM was taking referals for Industrial Mechanics and he turned my name in. I needed to quickly brush up on my mathematical and mechanical skills before taking the pre-employment exam. This book really let me down.First - It didn't cover anything about how to do any of the shop mathematics until after you (the reader) had taken the practice exams. NO formulas, equations, NOTHING! And they DID explain it at the end of the exams, but not well enough to understand where you the reader screwed up.Second - There were so many errors I lost count and closed the book never to read it again. Several of their answers were wrong; there were many typos and miscalculations. I don't buy a preparation guide for errors all it will do is confuse you as to if you are correct or forgot how to do arithmetic. I checked several of their calculations with a TI-90 calculator and the answers I received were not the same as theirs. ..."
4,Good Book,"It has a lot of useful information, but for the mechanically inclined test takers, you don't need this book.I took the AFOQT and I used all of my practical knowledge and experience to answer the mechanical comprehension questions.This book is useful for those who have no idea what a lugnut is, or why Ford puts a differential in the rear of RWD cars."
5,Best Disc Golf option for after-dark,"I LOVE THIS DISC!!!! It's understable so you may have to adapt to it, but it is super cool and flies great when you get the hang of it. Throw it on the course and watch everyone there come over to ask you about it! For playing at night this beats fishing lures and duct tape hands down.I can't wait to see the new stuff Black Jax Sports comes out with.See you on the course when the lights go out."
5,Highly recommended!,"We started using this product about 6 months ago in conjunction with a chewable immune defence wafer and my son seems to be staying healthier this winter compared to the past. A friend of mine suggested it as her son also tends to be sick all winter. I mix it with fruit juice to get it in him, but he still complains because he still knows I put something in it. Ya do what you have to to get a healthy kid!"
4,Don't you remember the hot summer day?,Last summer was very hot in Finland! There was over 30 plus Celsius.I was as sweat as I am in Finnish bastu and I had to drink all the time Coke or something fresh juice. I was almost dying in my house but luckily I found my saviour called Vornado. Without Vornado I would burned alive. Vornado gave me a cool feeling and I was not sweating anymore. It was so comfortable to sit my room which was before the Vornado like a Inferno. You can choose three different speed levels depending on how hot your room is. I usually choose the speed level two. Vornado is worth of having!
4,Cub Scout handbook,Though I purchased a used book for my grandson the book was in good shape and it saved money from the purchase price of a new one. Fast shipping. Thanks!
1,Too rudimentary. NOT worth [the money],"This book was really disappointing. It might be okay (maybe) for someone who has no idea where to begin starting a concierge service. But for anyone else, this book is a waste of money. I was hoping to get specific advice regarding networking with other businesses, best practices for marketing, and what challenges to watch out for. This book barely touches on those. And for anyone hoping to grow their concierge service into a big company, this book fails to talk about how to set yourself up in a way that will facilitate large amounts of growth. I got better advice from books related to starting a small business than from this book. (Entrepeneur's book ""Start Your Own Business"" is great.) If Giovanni's book was [less expensive], it would be worth purchasing. But [what i paid]is ridiculous."
3,I wouldn't say the best book for the industry but it did,I wouldn't say the best book for the industry but it did have some useful info and was a good read.
5,love the movie,"Got it quickly and gave it to my niece for xmas - she loved it. I don't know if it works, but I haven't heard a complaint - so I'm thinking it worked fine."
5,Great movie.,"As with the other Disney classics, this movie is amazing. I remember watching it as a kid and now i play it for my daughter and she loves it. And i still enjoy watching it too."
5,Woof!,"They did a good job cleaning up this classic, as they do to all their re-releases. The added features and bonuses are a fun plus if you're bored after watching the movie. It was definitely a good buy for me to obtain one of the classic Disney movies on DVD."
5,Happy Memories... priceless,Finding a way to rewind the lives of our grown children and seeing the joy in their faces as we unite over the holidays was worth a search. Amazon made it easy and shipped very quickly.
2,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD","I bought this movie because my then 15-month-old daughter was obsessed with the ad (she kept pointing at it and barking at the dalmations). She really does love the movie, but here's my big problem: there are NO LESS than three minutes of crappy Disney and Disney-partner advertisements at the beginning, after putting in the DVD, and you are not allowed to fast-forward nor skip through them. You watch about five or six of them, then get to the menu where you get to finally push play, at which point you're treated to three more before the opening credits begin to roll. It's worse than a rented movie from Blockbuster, and at least with those you have the option of skipping through them!Overall, though my 19-month-old daughter loves watching the movie (in short segments), I loathe having to load it up for her because by the time the opening credits are rolling, she's usually lost interest and is playing with something else."
1,Disappointed,"I was so excited about getting this movie, it's one of my favorites, but when it came in the mail and I started watching it the movie skips and freezes."
5,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ABOUT DOGS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Whoever doesn't love this movie is a crazy. I am a parent who grew up with pongo and perdita and bought this movie for my children and they absolutely love this movie. I highly recommend this to EVERYONE!
3,101 Dalmatians DVD,"Well DVD shipped perfectly, and was what it said it would be. It said it was previously owned, but still it was in good condition. There was no wrapper around it, and there was only a one page cardboad insert on the left side."
1,DON'T BUY!!! DOESN'T EXIST!!!!,There is no bluray version of 101 Dalmations. It has not been released and there is no announced release date yet. DO NOT BUY THIS!
5,Great family movie,I love 101 Dalmations. Its a great story for small children. One of disney's best films. Don't have to worry about its content for small children.
4,Good film & disc,"Not the best Disney film. What makes it for me is Cruella. Great character. Too bad for such a high price disc there is only the trailer as an extra. Disney needs to put extras on all their discs, especially when they ask a price like that. Great picture quality, though."
1,101 Dalmations - Movie does not play at all,"I received the movie and saved it to play for my granddaughter when I kept her for a week. I was so disappointed when we put the movie in and it started to drag from the start, and then completely quit. I tried other movies to make sure it wasn't my DVD player, and they were fine. Tried the movie again, same result. I'm going to email and see how to get a refund or another DVD."
1,Scratched. Hangs and skips.,"Got this for my niece and nephew. The DVD hung up, they lost interest and wandered away. Slightly better after I cleaned the disc. Not useable."
3,"Good movie, obnoxious DVD","This DVD is filled with unskippable ads and previews. It takes over a minute of pressing fast-forward to get to the actual movie. I paid, why do I have to put up with obnoxious, deliberately customer-unfriendly ads?And my kids can't turn on the movie themselves."
2,"Great product, terrible delivery","I was very happy when I received this item as a gift for my neice. However, the box was crushed, as if someone had stepped on it. The DVD cover was also bent, and I was actually not surprised. I have had a few awful experiences with Amazon, including ordering a Christmas present, then told weeks after that it wasn't in stock, and they woudn't be repaying me for the item I would never receive. This is my last purchase through Amazon."
3,In Response to the individual who said this does not exist...,"It most certainly does exist. It is available in Europe and is being imported from the UK as a region free release. You make your decision if you want to buy the version currently available or wait on the US release, but to say this does not exist is just plain wrong. There is also a version with both 101 AND 102 Dalmations in the same package, if you prefer. I cannot give a personal review as I have not seen it, but the PQ has received favorable reviews and has a DTS MA soundtrack."
4,This is a Cute Movie!.,One Hundred and one Dalmations is a really good Disney movie and it's a cute story that everyone in the family can enjoy and I highly recommend it!
5,great service,"Shipped very fast I got it within just a few business days, the cover was just a little worn but the disc played great, it never skipped and was in great condition. Thanks! would order again."
2,101 dalmations,I was really disappointed in the fact that it takes me about 3 trys to even get the movie started. There is so much junk in front of the movie and then there is a long hesitation before the movie starts. Sometimes it even freezes at the security screen and I have to take it out and try it again. I have tried doing the fast play and also going to the main menu. It just takes forever to get it going. I have never had that kind of trouble with a movie before. Very strange. bad dvd!!!! It should not be titled platinum edition!
3,Nice movie,"I admit I don't like this movie as much as my top favorites such as ""The Great Mouse Detective"" or ""Pinocchio"", but I find this film respectable for what it is. It has dogs, it takes place in London, it's an animal rescue mission movie, so it's good. Even though Cruella DeVil is one of the overused Disney Villains, I did find her more interesting than the last villain of a dog movie, Aunt Sarah. There is a little more serious action in this movie, and I think it does well for Disney's first Xerox film. I think I would pick this movie over a few certain Disney movies. If you like dogs or Disney's animal rescue mission movies, check this movie out and discover for yourself."
5,Great movie for the whole family,"This Disney classic has never looked better. It is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. You and your family will see and feel the magic from this movie every time you see it, the same way the creator intended to. Enjoy!!!!!"
5,Brings back childhood memories!,I am currently on a journey to own every disney movie I watched and loved as a child so that I can one day pass it on to my children and grandchildren. I wanted the original copy but couldn't find it so I got the new version. It still brings back great memories and looks the same as the original. I'm so glad I was able to order it from Amazon!
1,101 Dalmations,wrong movie.... ordered and wanted the original.need to return it - this is too scary for little ones to see
4,Good.,"Movie was good. Thought my daughter would be more interested in this movie since she loves dogs but so far it's not one of her fav's, yet."
5,*~cruella de~vil~*cruel~la de~vil~~*,a classic. no need for words. i never get tired of watching this. it's not even that easy to find elsewhere.
2,A disappointment,I agree with everything the previous reviewer stated - with one addition. Mine DID quit after less than a year from the date of purchase.
5,Little Helper,"It is a great recorder,it helps me to remember things,I would forget normally.I have been using it for about a month,and well pleased."
5,Mystery Within Mystery,"On its surface The World Through your eyes is a mystery charged with political intrique and historical truths. At its center, this book is a powerful and moving tour through the heart of the greatest and most universal mystery of all: the search for one's own identity. An adoptee searches for her father, the search leads her to Spain and then back in time to the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. As the heroine gains a deeper understanding of herself, an incredible chapter in history unfolds charged with the insight and intrique that only a master story teller can provide.As history and as literature The World Through Your eyes succeeds on every level. For those who were adopted or who have given children for adoption, the story resonates with experience. For all of us, it resonates with truth."
5,If you like baseball read this book!!,"Nick and the rest of the team are the main characters in the book. The minor characters are the other teams that they play and the friends and family of the players on Nick's baseball team. Nick's baseball team is not very good. This year, they don't have a coach Nick's mom decides to become the coach. The whole team thinks that their team will do even worse. This book really takes place in the 1980's in Nick's town. But could take place anytime and anywhere as long as there is faith, determination and baseball."
1,Cost To Operate Is Outrageous,If you want a humidifier that will continue to suck money out of your pocket - this is the machine for you. In a three month period it has been necessary for me to purchase 8 replacement filters (for 2 humidifiers) due to them drying out. That cost has now exceeded the initial purchase price for the orginal product. I would not recommend this item to anyone!
3,Good humidifier with expensive filters,"The performance of the humidifier is good. However, it requires regular change of filters and the filters are expensive ($6.99/ piece). They need to be changed atleast once a month. Therefore, the low cost of the humidifier is compensated by a recurring cost of changing filters."
3,so-so,"No automatic shut-off, and no indicator light to show when the water level is low. And it's difficult to see through the dark, ""smoked"" reservoir to check the level."
1,Noisy and works well only with brandnew filter,"Not only is this humidifier very noisy even while running in the ""quiet mist"" mode, the performance of the humidifier decreases strongly after little more than a week, then the filters stop working and don't raise any humidity at all."
1,expensive filters with short life,"They say the filter will last 3 months, but it only lasts about 2-3 weeks. I use this humidifier in my dry NYC apartment, and it definitely works well. It's nice and quiet too, but I have spent WAY too much money on these filters!! And I clean the tank MORE often than recommended, and flip the filter every day as recommended! Why should you go broke just to have a bit of humidity!? BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
3,Worked well for a few years,"I've had this for about 4 years, and recently it started leaking water all over the floor. I had read a review about positioning the tank correctly, but I couldn't see how it was positioned wrong so it would leak. Plus I'd never had this problem in all the prior years of usage. Like other reviewers, I wasn't happy about the cost of the filters or the constant need to replace them. Also not going to risk a third leakage and wet floor by using again. Currently shopping for a new one."
4,sleepin' in the mist,I love this humidifyer. I got it because I have asthma. It seems to help my husband who has Sleep Apnia also.
1,I should have listened to the nay-sayers here,"My Hamilton Beach 05521 TrueAir Cool Mist Humidifier performed as advertised for four days, then quit working. The fan runs, the filter is in top condition - it simply will not raise the humidity. This unit replaced a Sunbeam ultrasonic humidifier that gave good service for years before quitting, but I wanted to try one that wouldn't have the ""white dust"" issue.I think that reviewers should be required to state HOW LONG they have used the product they are reviewing. Perhaps there would be fewer rave reviews. This Hamilton Beach humidifier appears to suffer from poor engineering or poor quality control."
2,"Nice Ergonoimics, but Poor Design and Poor Quality Control","I had to return this product because of four reasons:a) The motor bearing had a problem, causing the fan to make a ""ticking"" sound whenever it spun;b) The fan was eccentrically mounted on its shaft which made the fan spin off-balance, causing additional noise;c) The water tank nozzle required a very strong person and unusually high amount of force to open it and close it. This tank has a regressive ""quarter-turn"" design rather than the traditional screw-on cap.d) Turning the fan off tripped my GFI outlet, revealing poor fan motor circuit design.On the lighter side, this unit is an excellent example of great ergonomic design. It has a water containment tray (so you dont need to place one underneath), removable/dishwasher safe water tray, and the fan unit and power cord are modular and completely/easily removable."
2,Expensive!,"This humidifier works well and is very quiet for a humidifier. However, here in Texas at least, the filter gets moldy in 3-5 days. So if I kept using it, I'd be spending more than the cost of the humidifer buying filters in less than a month. If there was a filter that could be cleaned and reused, this would be a great humidifier."
3,HB Humidifier OK,"A little louder than a Kenmore product that I bought last year, but is easier to clean and refill. Also filter stays out of tank full of water and that helps keep it longer."
2,Expensive filter and no control,"Filter is made of the paper and you have to change often, otherwise it melts down. It is a $6.99 each. Even if you buy a cheap machine, it would turn into expensive machine. If you don't change the filter, this machine mists stinky water. I use a filtered water however, I can smell it. Also, I noticed that...When there is no water, it doesn't stop automatically. It will work forever when you don't stop. For example, the fan inside rotated more than 24 hours without water. I didn't know that. After that, I often check if there is water inside or not. I still have 3 more filters. After I use them, I will trash it. I will not buy it again."
3,Integrity,"Damned good book about a time not too long ago, when there were gentlemen of integrity leading us; men and women who cared deeply about the future of their state and country.They walked the talk ...."
4,Good ideas,"This book has a lot of good ideas for actively learning about and participating in Catholic social teaching, but there is a student book that I did not know about, which has sections for students to read and are not included in the teacher's book. Therefore, it is incomplete by itself."
5,Ditto Sally Ayres,"I had lunch with a co-worker today. When he told me his kids were 2 and 4, I immediately launched into how wonderful this book and its follow-on were. I told him how I'd taught both of my children to read using this book, and how much it had helped them through high school and college. I told him how I'd bought copies for both of my children to eventually use with my grandchildren. When we returned to the office, we looked it up on Amazon. There the first review was from Sally Ayres, and we had to double-check the name, because I thought I had written it myself. Even the part about the first word being CAT and having to say it fast enough to smear the sounds together - my kids went through the same thing. I can't say enough about how much this method of learning reading has helped my children, who are now both in college. I look forward to teaching my grandchildren to read using this book!"
3,"Point taken, not very well written","Flesch's point is that the way to teach Englishreading & writing is by phonics, and thatthe ""other"" method -- the so-called""word-method"" -- not only does a poor job butactually causes damage. It is an honest andsincere book, but not very well written. Forone thing, Flesch repeats the same point about8 million times. Even he himself admits this in the book: ""Did I say this before? Forgive me.I have fallen into the habit of telling people the simple facts about reading over and over again.It seems to be the only way."" (Ch 1, p18).Written in the 50's, the bookalso contains interesting wording that would beconsidered ""non-PC"" (politically incorrect)today, such as ""Girls prefer fur"" (Ch 2, p26)."
4,Understand of why so many adults read so poorly,"This is another of my favorite books that I found so useful, as a teacher. One on one I taught children who were poor readers learn how easy and fun reading really could be. Their reading, spelling, other schoolwork and their attitude towards themselves improved quickly. Flesch's attack on the Boston school district and the method reading was taught(kid sees picture of cow, associates it with ""cow"" and can now read the word cow without the need to learn the phonetic sounds of the letters and letter combinations first). At that time his views were concedered far from 'politically correct'. Many teachers, after reading his book, pushed for abandoning this new ""revelation"" in reading. This brought us back to phonics. I have also purchesed his later book, ""Why Johnny Still Can't Read"". I'm looking forward to reading it too,"
1,This is horrible,Don't waste your money.The mice are partying in our kitchen beneath this product. Don't waste your money.
1,Pest Repeller..... NOT!,This was the worst purchase I've ever made in my crusade against the ants and spiders that have taken over my home! I have MORE pests now than I did before. Actually had ants crawling on one of the repeller units. If you're thinking about buying this product... DON'T waste your money. You'd be better off with a couple of cans of Raid!
2,The Roaches are still here!!!,"These devices failed to get the roaches to leave my kitchen. That's probably because the roaches in DC are exposed to ultrasonic noises everyday. In rooms where there was minimal roach infestation, the devices did a good job. However, the roaches still hang out in the kitchen. As a matter of fact, roaches were even crawling all over the repeller. It wasn't until the exterminator came and laid down some gel did the number of roaches in the kitchen decrease. The exterminator will be coming back in a week to check the progress.However, I will still keep the devices since many have said that they do a great job repelling big critters (like rats, mice, etc). I haven't had a mouse problem in awhile before purchasing these repellers, but I just want to make sure they don't come back."
1,pr30,i tried the 5 pack in my garage with no luck the mice still live there its a lot of hype product no god keep your reciept bring them back
5,great communication after I sent a email.,I was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when I sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what I needed and wanted to cancel the order. He very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and I was impressed with this service. Gayla Tregre
1,Did not work for me,"I bought this product because I live in a basement apartment and have a horrendous spider problem. THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME. Spiders seem to LIKE it; they used it to make cobwebs on! The product information ... states that it works for rodents, spiders, ants, etc. But the product information included in the packaging ONLY mentions that this product is suitable for RODENT control. I am returning this product."
1,This product is useless,"Why can't I give 0 stars?I have watched our resident mouse run past this product on at least three occasions, and saw it got bold enough to run straight into the living room while I was sitting there with my (non-ratter) dog. This product is a WASTE OF MONEY, spend your money on traps and poison, sonic rays aren't going to get mice."
4,Go ahead take a chance,"worked on the ants in my kitchen, during wet weather they love to come inside. I use this and a different electro magnetic pest control. Would not recommend buying the 2 in one models. Better control is why..ultra sonic doesn't go through solid objects, better coverage if put in key areas, electro magnetic can be put just about any where. Doesn't seem to work on mice - but if you're having problems....you've got nothing to lose !!! Cheaper than Terminix !!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"Very disappointed. Purchased 6 of these for an 1100 sq. foot apartment to eliminate the common spider and occasional ants and insects that appear in the Spring and Summer time. Well, I think these units INVITE the ants in. We've never had more ants than we do now despite following directions to place these units on opposite walls in the same room, etc. These devices do not phase them at all - they continue to parade right by!"
1,Didn't make a difference...,"Bought this item trying to get rid of the ants problems in the summer. Didn't make a difference at all. The ants still marched into our house. Tried to position them at different outlets at different parts of the room, and it still did not work."
3,Comfortab,"The music was good; it was mostly early rock and roll with a few earlier songs. The recording quality was thin, but I am spoiled by modern technology."
1,bad buy,"This product is supposed to put negative ions in the air. It should attach these ions to dust particles, etc., make them weigh more so that they fall to the ground instead of lingering in the air. A metal bar is inside that is to be wiped clean (I suppose showing that it is working). I have had it plugged in for over a month -- nothing has appeared on the strip to clean off and I have not seen any significant improvement in the air quality. I am returning this item ASAP."
4,pretty good,it took a while to arrive but it did exactly what it was supposed to do. i'm glad that i have one now.
4,one of fencings finest,"I guess I have some bias when reviewing this book, as I am one of his many students. Dr. Volkman lays out the essence of fencing in a very easy to follow format, this is a must have for fencers, beginners and veterans alike."
5,MORE OF THE SAME GREATNESS,"For those of you who didnt happen to get a copy of the Wichita Lineman CD, the first CD is a treat, even for those of us who did its still. This disc is a continuation of the space sounds they started with on Atardecer.Get it and prepare to be amazed!"
3,Something Missing,This is another laptop driven release that is missing something.There is simply very little musical style in this release. The concept and technique may be of interest. Yet the result is quite bland. A release which fuses laptop glitch and cutup with engaging and emotional music is Fennesz' excellent 'endless summer' release.
2,Beautifully Flawed Pt. 2,"I agree with another reviewer in that the fan is very nicely designed [something I place a lot of importance in] however, practically everything about this fan is aggravating. From having to disassemble it to clean the blades to the fact that on the low speed it rattles to the fact that the side knob to hold angle doesn't actually hold. This product *looks* like it's rock solid but it's a flimsy item."
2,"Yes, it IS beautifully flawed.","Sure it's pretty, but it's also pretty useless. Like Hobbs (another reviewer) noted, the knob to hold the fan at a particular angle DOESN'T hold. So it blows air where IT wants, not where I want. Obviously, this is a problematic product. I should have known better, given how many ""factory reconditioned"" ones I have seen available. Gee, wonder why the factory has so many available to recondition. Dumb me for buying it. Do yourself a favor and find a real vintage fan at a thrift store."
4,Great fan,"A solid, heavy duty fan which is light years better than the all plastic box fans out there. The heavier than usual weight knobs (which are a heavy plastic) worked fine for me and the fan succeeds just fine in moving air around. We've had ours for several seasons, use it in the bedroom and are very happy with it both in terms of its' style and utility."
1,not what i expected!,this fan is very well built and very stylish looking but it moves very little air for the amount of wind noise it makes!i returned it and it is taking amazon a loooooooooooooong time to put the funds back on my mastercard!
1,Terrible Plastics,"It would be a good fan, but the plastics break. I have had to replace the plastic switch (broke when I turned it a little too hard) and the plastic ""rim"" (TWICE: both times when the fan fell off its perch). This is ridiculous. Don't buy this fan. It looks great, and runs well, but it is poor construction. It is simply not durable enough to take normal wear and tear. Post Script: Vornado is going to replace free of charge, this time."
2,poor quality,Got this for someone as a Christmas present and recently found out that it was not dvd quality. The quality of the movie when shown on cable tv is better then the quality of the dvd. Obviously it's not an original dvd
5,the oldies,To me it is important that a US DVD is subtitled in english I own an multiregion DVD player so for video there is not problem.In product details the title was signed subtitled in english. But it is not.I keep it all the same but the detail product should be corrected detaild
5,A Great Family Film,"My Great Grandfather was in this movie as a French Trapper. It was great to see a man, whom I never met, on the big screen. It would be a great movie for the entire family. It has some excellent scenery shots and a great performance by Clark Gable. It combines history, comedy, and drama all wrapped into one film."
1,Where is the River ?,"I bought this movie thinking it was a classic. It was,instead, a waste of time. Amazon might even advertise instant video cannot be watched over HDMI before you rent one."
4,performs as promised,"I got this in hopes it would solve an instability issue, turned out that the problem was not with my power suply. But am happy with it, it's quiet and performs as promised."
2,Cheap =(,"I bought this tool set as a gift for my boyfriend because it was fairly inexpensive and had a good review. I was very disappointed with the quality of it. The hammer looks like it is sloppily glued together, the case fell apart almost immediately - essentially the set looks and is cheaply made. It's been months since I bought the set (the only reason I'm posting this is because I was going through past orders and was appalled that this set had only one 4-star review!) and I'm not well-versed on the names of different items in the set - but most of the items were plastic and cheap looking. Maybe this should have been obvious from the price, but I was still very disappointed that I spent $50 on something that was more appropriately made to be a play tool kit for a child than to be used to actually do any kind of repairs. My advice - spend more and get something of better quality! We haven't gotten any use out of it."
2,Terrible diagrams,"They say one picture is worth a thousand words. Well, the diagrams in this book are SO bad that they actually have a substractive effect on one's understanding. This book will be helpful to you as long as you have the ability to visualize on your own what he writes about."
3,The Final Installment,"'The Wrath of Mulgarath' is the fifth and final book of 'The Spiderwick Chronicles'. It brings everything to a final satisfactory, albeit rushed, conclusion.Overall the series was good, and I definitely would recommend it for tweens. It has a fairly engaging story, great illustrations and is a good introduction to fantasy. Adults, on the other hand, will find it episodic, rushed and somewhat insubstantial. As well the fact that the story is split into five separate books is also somewhat annoying."
4,A satisfying end,"This was the conclusion to the Spiderwick Chronicles and it was the best book in the series yet. It was all wrapped up well, with lots of magical creatures and fun surprises. I really enjoyed this children's series!"
4,"Well written, fun story","My son, who is just about finished with 3rd grade, enjoyed this series very much and was sad to see it end. The story was well written, with only a few story lines to follow and concluding with no loose ends. Some of the language was unnecessary and made the reading a bit uncomfortable at times as there were things written that are not permitted to be said in our household, but overall a very good read."
2,Satisfying conclusion? Did you read the same book we did?,"Don't get me wrong, my family and I loved this entire series - even if we wound up paying about five times what we would have shelled out if the publisher had put everyting under one cover (but, hey, more power to them that they can get us to pay!). The ending (and no, I won't play spoiler and give it away) was way too abrupt. Even my second grader asked ""Is that it? That's lame! There has to be more!"" I hope we do get more of this series (or something similar from the authors) anyway."
2,Not pristine,"I expected a perfect, new book, and was disappointed to find the spine a bit wonky and a big scratch on the back cover of this book. This was especially disappointing as it was a present."
5,The Wrath of Mulgareth(Spiderwick Chronicles #5,I think the ending to this book was very good. I love the entire series and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie when it comes out next year.
5,The Final Installment of the Spiderwick Chronicles,"Another excellent series for children! Join Jared, Simon, and Mallory Grace as they come to the end (or is it? at least for this series) of their adventures into the faerie world. Guided by their mysterious uncle's sketch book the heroes and heroine of these stories will finally come face to face with the biggest, baddest, and meannest of the faeries, The Ogre Mulgarath! The first 4 in this series of five openned my eyes to a wonderful world of enchantment and I can't wait to see how it comes to an end."
1,The Bad Book,"The Bad BookMallorie Icant belive the Byron ate the Dragon babiesThe book the wrath of Mulgrath kid'sMallory, Simon and Jared .They are going through a wicked adventure they've had to fight dragons andThimbletack going and destroying their lovely house ,and the kid's parents areAlso going through a divorce.Mallory, Simon and Jared have to go to the junkyard castle and save their parents.My favorite part of this book is when the Byron and the dragon were fightingI think the authors purpose was to write a book in a Harry Potter style to attract kids who like fantasy and Harry Potter Books.I think this is a good book. I would recommend purchasing a hard copy of it"
3,Nice collection of Beatles' covers by well-known artists,"Compilation of Lennon/McCartney tunes plus ""Something"", put together by Tower Records (believe it or not, there used to be stores that sold records, CDs and such!). Some well-known covers here, such as Joe Cocker and many lesser known ones. The Beach Boys covers sound like it was out of the same session that produced Barbara Ann. Overall an enjoyable collection by known artists that, for the most part, interpret the songs in their own style."
4,a wonderful book,"Like many of Noel Streatfeild's books, this places ordinary children in an exciting context and shows the hard work behind the glamour. In this case a brother and sister, Peter and Sasha, adjust to a very different life as they go to live with their uncle, Gus, a clown in a circus. The story is set in England in the time between the two world wars and is a fascinating glimpse into a vanished way of life, but the people and their problems are very contemporary. Peter and Sasha grow through their experiences and we grow with them. Noel Streatfeild's books always emphasise that we have the resources to meet the challenges life throws at us, if we are prepared to work hard and to use our intelligence and common sense. I recommend this as one of her best."
4,Good Streatfeild development,"Good character development and different from her ""shoe books"". However, it does involve children who are in need of care. I enjoy all Streatfeild's books, some more than others. Here I picked up some circus knowledge. I see her personality in at least one character in all her stories."
1,A swiss symphony that stinks,"A swiss symphony that stinksEn av dom sämsta symfonier jag ngonsin har haft tillfälle att lyssna till, och jag har hört mnga. Stor och blockartad utan ngra minnesvärda melodier, tämligen taffligt orkestrerad men temat till variationerna är rätt trevlig. Medioker orkester som nätt och jämt kan med symfonin och dirigenten verkar ha mer vilja än den faktiska kunnigheten.Rekommenderas endast till Brun-älskare.Use Google to translate dear reader."
4,Such a cute dish for a jungle/safari themed room!,"I got this for a candy dish for my safari themed parlor. It is much heavier than one would think. Very nicely carved. Great quality! The only thing is I wished they would have listed the measurements of it. It is about 4 inches wide and 4 inches long. Very small! It still works, I just thought/wished it was a bit larger. When I have candy in it, it totally covers all of the carving, even the carving up the side. Maybe 6 inches? Still happy I purchased it.Norma >^..^<"
3,Just ok...,"The only reason I ordered this movie was because I am a huge Josh Stewart fan! The movie reminds me somewhat of the movie ""Vacancy"" only not as good. But, I love Josh Stewart and is worth watching if you are a fan of his but otherwise...can't say I would recommend it."
3,Take the good with the bad,"Paul (Josh Stewart of the FX TV show ""Dirt"") and adrienne (Jamie-Lynn Sigler of the much- better known Sopranos) are forced to divulge secrets after they stop at a peculiar motel in the middle of the Mojave Desert and meet some of it's weird denizens.This movie was slow, uneventful, and while not boring, not particularly enjoyable. However the acting was decent and the soundtrack to the film was pretty good.The mystery behind some huge secret had my intrigued, but the pay-off for that wasn't really worth my investment in it."
1,Review,The product arrived safely and in relatively good shape. The content was what I had anticapated and the very reason it was ordered. I believe it can be assumed that I enjoy the DVD/CD(s). You probably have figured out that I strongly dislike being made to write these reviews. I can see reviewing a book or a product that is being tried for the first time.
2,"Good, but...","It would be nice to see films without little quips pushing a political agenda that don't fit with what the characters would likely say.Immediately the film starts off with a put down of fox news, sure the character could say this but viewers with IQs above room temp can tell it's typical liberal trash speak."
5,Masterful,Cherryh's Union/Alliance universe have long been favorites and Voyager In Night is no exception. Dealing with abduction; coming to terms with death and the horror of meeting yourself; coupled with an unfathomable alien intelligence makes this book compelling and thought provoking. It is a stand alone book and highly recommended for SF fans.
2,Finish chips easily,"We have a few of these rattles. The finish is chipped on all of them, and my baby does have any teeth yet."
2,Writer never watched The Cell,"If The Cell was directed in the 80s, had the next-best-thing to Jennifer Lopez, and was nothing like The Cell at all, it would be The Cell 2.Some films are a natural progression from the original, others are The Cell 2. Follow a carnival gypsy as she reads fortunes and looks into the present to unravel a serial killer's secret.Wasn't the original ""The Cell"" some nonsense about using technology to enter a killer's mind and being in some whacky killer's mind world? This is some different nonsense about a magical witch using voodoo and items of the victims to see what they see. They're not remotely the same line of movies, might as well call Jurassic Park ""Little Women 2"". Nudity less than 10 minutes into the film, so there's no need to watch more than 10 minutes of this."
3,the cell 2,"Being killed and brought back to life many times has to suck. That's what the victems in this film have to face before being killed for real. The cell 2 is for sure not as great as the cell, but it does have some good parts. The mind of the killer is not as exciting as the previous killer but it's still a little wicked. All the colors and mirrors were cool. The characters you don't really care for but the plot is enjoyable enough and the acting is fine. It's a blockbuster rental."
3,A watchable thriller,"Some of these reviews seem a bit harsh. This is a direct to DVD film, it does not have the budget of a major motion picture. We need to judge the film against its peers. While the special effects are not award winning, I thought they were acceptable. The crew did well with a limited budget and schedule. The science is indeed goofy, but if we reject horror films with goofy science there won't be much left to watch. I don't want to spoil the film, so I will only say that I liked Frank Whaley's performance and no one seemed to be sleep walking though the film. All in all it is a nice watchable film and I will probably watch it again some time. I give it 3 stars and for the record, I would give the original ""The Cell"" 4 stars."
2,Different from the original,"The Cell 2 is different from the Original, which is not all bad. It has an interesting villain, who keeps ""killing"" his victims and then bringing them back from the brink of death. While it does not have the name stars that were in the original, the actors do a competent job. Unfortunately, the movie lacks any suspense, and in the end, is a disappointment. Watch the original for great acting and an interesting premise."
1,Not worthy of the sequel title,Very bad. I should have trusted my first instinct and not jumped to get this one. Just because a sequel has the same title as the original (The Cell - which was great!) does not guarantee satisfaction. Very poorly written ... very poorly acted ... almost non-existent special effects. Not even close to the visual masterpiece that was The Cell. Stay away from this one.
3,"OK, especially on a budget","On the plus side:(1) LATCH belting and available extra bases make getting this seat in & out/moving between cars much easier than was true for models made 9 years ago.(2) VERY comfortable for a sleeping infant.(3) Base and seat manage to stay seated correctly, even after much driving.On the minus side:(1) Handle is difficult to adjust; you almost need 3 hands to keep it stable whole you adjust the thing.(2) (this may be a problem for most of these carrier/car seats)It becomes difficult to nearly impossible to use as a carrier once the baby weighs much more than 13 lbs., as the combined weight of the child IN the carrier (plus the bulk) makes the contraption hard to lift & place into the base or onto a shopping cart. My husband has even commented about this.Overall, it's great for about 4 or 5 months tops (unless your child is unusually small), but then it's high time to sink the $$ into a convertible seat."
2,Not my dream carseat,"The first one arrived with the wrong pieces, so we were unable to put the sunshade together. We sent it back. The second one came with all the right pieces, but even then I can't say I'm thrilled. The seat is much more confining than the one I used to have, and the baby is far less comfortable; he gets all smushed up inside. Also, it sits up v. high in the car instead of tilting back so his head is always hanging forward, despite the head roll, which is utterly ineffective. Lastly, the parts that need to be pushed in in order to lift or lower the handle are so stiff that I have a very hard time moving the handle (so does my much stronger husband for that matter). Overall, a good price and looks cute, but not fabulously functional."
3,Good Price but problem with Amazon shipping,"I received the dishes as a gift. The value for the price paid is great. Unfortunately, one of the cups came broken. Amazon stated that I would have to ship the entire set back to get a replacement for one cup. The packaging of the set would make it nearly impossible to get the set back into the box. In addition, the box was so heavy, that the packaging came damaged. Amazon advised that my only other option would be to call the manufacturer and order a replacement for a fee. In the future, it would be better to purchase the set directly from the manufacturer."
2,Target better get the Packaging Correct !!!!!,"Yes, I like the product, and it is a good value for the money. But I just received my shipment, and it is the worst packaged box. What is Target thinking... 5 of my pieces are broken! If you are going to buy one set, better buy two, and save your self the headache of returning, especially since I doubt they will package any better the second time."
4,Solid but could be better,I have to say as a naked music fan getting albums in a random order I came away not too impressed. The production of this album is really really good. Still i found that some tracks were a little average for a naked music album. This has to be the first I gave 4 stars ever. I hope to see more variety in the next volume.
4,Dancin' With Them That Brung Me-Stacey Earle,"If you enjoy Lucinda Williams or Nanci Griffith, consider getting this ""coffee house"" music...simple, tuneful, and sincere, an excellent CD."
2,Disappointed,I am a fan of Steve Earle which is why I bought Stacy Earle's first album. I found Simple Gearle to be a beautiful and very impressive first album and was patiently awaiting Dancin' With Them That Brung Me. I have listened to it over and over hoping that it will grow on me and so far have been very disapointed. Dancin' With Them That Brung Me lacks the pure and honest singing and songwriting that Simple Gearle provides.
5,"The ""Real Deal""","Simple. Honest. Heartfelt. Stacey Earle's second effort builds admirably on the strong foundation of ""Simple Gearle"". What differs considerably, though, is the growing sense of confidence that is displayed in her singing and songwriting on the new CD. Sparce, yet elegant, this collection proves that touching and compelling music can still be made at home, by folks.In light of the fervent, renewed interest in re-discovering the ""roots"" of folk music (via the Harry Smith & Alan Lomax re-ssues, etc.), it is suprising that latter day music featuring the same honesty and simple beauty can be so easily missed."
4,Not-so-simple Gearle,"We've all gotten past the fact that Allison Krauss chooses to sing in a dainty voice (listen to her early work and you'll see it wasn't always so), so give this Gearle a chance. This apparently simple Gearle is really quite sophisticated as evidenced by her unique lyrics, fresh delivery and fine arrangements. Some of these tunes are quite catchy. A very nice work."
5,This humidifier is awesome!,"This humidifier saved me from having a sinus infection last year. Years prior, before I purchased this, I had sinus problems every year. It's WELL worth it to avoid doctor visits, and antibiotics. You need to know this is designed, probably, for one room. Don't think you can buy this and it'll work throughout your entire house. I suggest keeping it in your bedroom and crank it up while you're asleep. That's when you need it most anyway. I love this product, I've had other humidifiers that don't work nearly as well. Also, order the filters designed for it, not the cheap imitation ones at Walmart; they do not filter."
3,NOISY,"I feel opposite of some of the reviews, my husband(who is a heavy sleeper) and I thought it was loud and annoying. All I heard all night was the constant rotation of the fan. I have had other even cheaper humidifiers and sometimes forgot they were on because they were so quiet. We ran the humidifier upstairs and could hear it downstairs with the TV on. We took it out of our bedroom and put it in the hall, it was still loud. VERY annoying. I did like the Humidistat feature and the large tank, although cumbersome to fill I didn't have to fill it every day so that was nice."
3,"Solid product, decent price, but needs improvements","Two main problems with this model:1. To open the tank for re-filling, first you have to flip the tank upside down, then you have to use A LOT OF FORCE to twist the large cap. Why could they not simply provide a flip-up-to-open cover on the top of the tank to avoid these problems? I have no ideas why.2. The machine does not detect when the water level is low, meaning it does not have a low-water indicator nor automatically shut itself off (stop the fan)."
5,One of the best humidifiers around...,"(This review refers model (5519). Same review applies, this model just has a bigger holding tank...)I've been searching for a good humidifier (at the right price) for a long time... Finally, here it is! One that can control humidity level and give me a digital read out of the current humidity. This model also has a nice size water tank that can be filled without taking the whole unit to the sink. This model also included a filter system to help clear out dust and pollen. A nice size fan pushes the air to circulate the whole room. It also shuts on and off automatically, to keep the desired humidity level. There are 3 speed settings; quiet, med, and high. The high makes a good amount a sound, but I only use it when no one is in the room and need a boost of humidity. Quiet is just that... Like a portable fan at low speed. Worth every penny!"
2,Works well but fragile,Product works well. Fairly quiet as far as humidifiers go. Design of the tank is poor. You must turn it upside down to fill. It does not stand on its own when upside down so it's awkward to fill. Tank developed cracks after 3 months because of where he pressure points are during fill up. Filters are expensive so total cost to operate should be calculated.
4,Pleasantly humidified,"The TruAir 4.0 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier has done wonders for us. We live in a very dry climate in Texas and this humidifier can keep certain rooms at a good humidity level. It turns on and off by itself to maintian the 50% humidity level that we set it at. Also, it is easy to fill up with water and wash all the parts. If you need to quickly get the humidity up in a room you can turn it on high then run it at normal or the quiet settings. On quiet, it creates just enough white noise that our daughter sleeps very well. Due to the fan, this humidifier is not extremely quiet but we do run it in the livingroom and can easily listen to the tv or radio over it."
2,OK product.,"Generate good humids at desirable setting, but queit operation is NOT quiet!! Also, it doen't shut off if water runs out, so you want to frequently check for water level.I would buy other brand in future."
1,was not a good Idea,"the Quiet mode was very loud!....and I still had a dry nose and mouth it didnt feel like the humidity was there at all!...I tryed to adjust it and it would only still stay at 55%??? and the filter looked like it needed to be changed after a week?..at 12 dollars a filter, I dont think so.....wouldnt recomend it!..."
1,ineffective,"I bought this humidifier based on the reviews and (mistakenly) thinking it was an ultrasonic humidifier. I have a room that is 25x14 with 9 ft. ceilings. Even at the highest level this humidifier doesn't make a difference, except in the noise level - which is deafening. At the lowest level it doesn't work at all - even when I leave it on all the time.I also discovered today that mold was accumulating in the filter that I replaced less than a month ago.Totally ineffective, is my impression of the machine.I'm off to find a large capacity ultrasonic humidifier."
4,Satisfied,"We purchased this humidifer for our baby's room, and so far it has worked quite well. Ours has no problem reaching 50% humidity, unlike problems mentioned in other reviews. The only time it did not humidify properly was when the filter needed to be changed. We changed the filter and it was back to working fine. I don't find the unit noisy when it is running, however at times it does make a random 'glugging' sound which is annoying."
3,Okay but could be better,This book was easy to read but didn't say too much. I practice Kung Fu San Soo and the information here can easily be found on any number of websites or just by visiting a dojo. It was nice to read about my art but i thought it could've been more in depth and researched. More information about San soo's past needs to be learned and writen about.
2,Realm,"I ordered a men's fragrance called Realm from the picture displayed in the ad. What I received was not the same product. The packaging was different, the container tube was different and the fragrance was similar but different. I suspect that it was a cheap knockoff. I threw it out! I am now closing my account."
5,Just like the cologne...,"As I said about the cologne in another review, this stuff is Love Potion number 9! I love for my hubby to wear it. It's the best!"
5,LOVED IT!!,"I loved Catch of the Day!! It was well written and the characters were extremely likeable. I hope to see the side stories developed into other books, I will be be watching and waiting!!"
5,Great from beginning to end,"This book was laugh out loud funny featuring the funniest one liners from golf's all time greats and not so greats. From Chi Chi Rodriguez to Tiger Woods--this book captures all their greatest quotes. Of course I'm biased--I am the author. If you would like more info about this book or any of my other books, please feel free to contact me at glennliebman.com. Thank you and enjoy the book."
4,It's Good!,"This is a great Bebop album, with some incredible solos!Very fast and up-beat tunes, full of energy!I don't know much about Charles Tolliver, but I like his sound! Check this CD out!"
3,different from garota moderna,Les sophisticated than garota moderna but more organic than this. Well produced and arranged (thanks to roberto menescal)and including a handfull of singles.
2,Not as good as I would have liked,Attaching the garden hose to this soaker hose is difficult. This is a cheap unit which is also shorter than I expected. The circumference is not what I expected or needed.
1,Poorly Designed,"You'd think that something as simple as a hose that's formed in a circle with two connectors would work just fine, but it didn't. Every time we turned the water on a very low stream one of the ends of the soaker hose blew off. We couldn't get it to stay on, so now my handyman needs to go to the hard ware store and buy a new end end valve that will stay on when the waters turned on. Time consuming and a real pain."
4,Good for large plants as well as bushes and trees.,"I use this on my large hydrangea, which is on a timed hose. The soaker keeps water from running off in all directions.Only one problem with this soaker is that the connecter to the water hose is rigid, leaving you to either spin the soaker or the water hose to get it connected. so you have to be sure and connect it before you put it in place."
3,OK but not great,"This product does but is over designed. Many of the smaller, single wheeled ab rollers are better because the instability works out a lot more stabilizing muscles, and they are also a lot cheaper. Save your money and buy a single wheeled ab roller."
1,DVD Doesn't Work,"I bought this DVD for my husband for Christmas. It was very disappointing when we tried viewing it on several different DVD players and none of them could read it. When I tried to contact the provider on Amazon, I was also not able to link up. I will be happy to withdraw this review if the provider contacts me. Right now it seems that I was taken."
1,Much prefered 'Naked Places',"Not enough info and when called for help at Nazca plains, got a very rude operator."
1,Don't spend your money.,"I bought this because I'm a HUGE Paramore fan and it says track two is a song called ""Disease"". I got the CD in the mail today and it's just Pressure, which is on their first full-length. WTF AMAZON? 13 dollars for tracks available everywhere."
2,Most disappointing,"It is hard to know where to start with this production. The casting is poor with little to differentiate the Bohemians other than weight. Rodolfo makes even Pavarotti look slim! The lighting is dreadful, mostly too dark and with serious backlighting issues. Only in the last act does it come right but by then it is all too late. I cannot recommend this production at all. Rent if you must but caveat emptor."
2,sound issues,"I don't know if I received a defective version of the Blu-ray, but I retruned it to Amazon for a full refund. Blu-ray supposedly has uncompressed audio, which should make it sound even better than a CD. The disc that I received was almost unlistenable in its poor audio quality. The sound seemed like it was recorded using a cell phone microphone, tinny and variable in terms of pickup. This is my absolute favorite opera, and was the first opera that I purcased on Blu ray. I would have put up with a lot just to be able to watch it in HD. Unfortunately, even the video quality was not great. It had a soap opera-like video quality rather than film-like quality.I was too distracted by the presentation quality to even notice the performer's talent, so I will abstain from commenting on it."
2,Rather dull and weak follow-up to the first.,"Title says it all really. This film is more a prequel than a sequel to the first, with what should have been the finale of the first film rather awkwardly tacked on to the last 10 minutes. Though some of the continuity from the first to the second is really really off, as well as the general feel of the film. While the first movie was all about goofy entertaining action this movie tries to make you genuinely care about the relationship of the two main characters and it really doesn't succeed as you already know them from less serious material, resulting in a jarring change of tone. Poorly paced and with not half the energy and action of the first film I'd say one might be able to enjoy this if they watched it before the first, stopped when the transition from prequel-to-end-of-first-film starts (about 15 minutes before the end) then watched the first movie and finally finished this. But honestly I'd say just skip this one, it is at most a rental."
5,As Ordered,"Hello, nothing much to say about this product but was shipped/delivered timely and in good condition. Product was as ordered, no funny business.I purchased this product to start toying with the idea of substituting this for the many other chemicals in our house. Worked well but now I save a ton of cash by purchasing the 35% food grade. I do purchase the 35% food grade here on Amazon."
1,A1 service,Deodorizer didn't perform as advertised. Returned product with prompt refund credited to my account.
4,Nat and Buddy,"A fascinating look at the creation of a jazz recording circa 1946, before Nat became a household word. Charlie Shavers and Chu Berry are in great company! Fascinating to listen to - I've had this in my collection for more than 30 years and it's a real pleasure to see this on CD. While not ""essential"" in the desert island sense, it is a great way to hear legendary performers creating music that stills sounds exciting more than 60 years later."
4,Surprising,"This was a made for TV movie with Leelee Sobieski (sp?) as the star. In my opinion most TV movies are fairly rotten, but this one is excellent! Words such as noble, honor, passionate, and romantic describe the story that is told. Good acting, well scripted and moves along nicely."
3,Get the longer version on DVD,The VHS edition of this movie is severely edited. Nearly 40 minutes have been cut. The movie (which aired on television in two parts) in its entirety (3 hours) can be found on the DVD edition.
4,A Second Coming of 311,I first heard this band when I caught them as the opening act for the 2 Skinnee J's Farewell Show in NC and was blown away. Their blend of rock and rap reminded me of a younger 311. I was also amazed at their poise on stage and their ability to rock the entire crowd. Their cd is less energetic then their stage performance but still worth picking up if you a big fan of that genre of the music. Also try to catch their stage show cuz it is amazing. THESE GUYS ARE GONNA BE HUGE!!!
4,Handy,Keep this on your key chain and you'll wonder why you went without it before. It is so useful. I use this tool at least once a day from opening up packages to clipping off labels. Just remember to remove it from your key ring before flying commercial. I have had three confiscated at TSA screenings.
5,Mini Swiss Army Knife rave,"Dear all,I am taking the time to review this product at Amazon's request because I think this is a great little tool, and other than being easy to lose, as it is so small, I like it enough to have owned many of them.Yours, Dan"
4,Great gifts,"Great stocking stuffers for my father in law, son in law, and best friend. Excellent quality of knife with toothpick which all ages can use."
5,Best little gadget to take anywhere. It's a staple.,"This knife is the ONLY knife that goes with my husband everywhere-for about 30 years now. Occasionally he has to buy a new one after the blade becomes dull-they are not expensive. He esp likes the personalized one, green with the shamrock (my Irish sweetheart!) He has taken it all over the world and you would be amazed how this little knife comes in handy, especially if I need it to file a rough nail! Or if you feel you'd sell your rt arm for a toothpick while on the road. I bought one for my sister-nurse, and mine is white. It is so transportable, but we don't carry it on the plane bec they are afraid that my 66 year old husband may use the 2"" knife to hijack the plane.(yeesh!)"
5,goosey,"awesome little gadget. everyone should have one of these, very small and durable and of course swiss made so you know it's quality"
5,Great Little Pocket Knife,"Always have this knife in my pocket, and use it for a number of daily tasks. Opening mail and packages clipping loose threads from clothes trimming that broken finger nail"
3,Tiny size,"This pocket knife has the usual high Victorinox quality. It is very portable, but its size limits it's use. The knife is suitable for opening taped boxes, but the blade is not much larger than an exacto-knife blade. The scissors is best used for clipping loose threads. The screw driver will allow only very slight twisting force on a small, straight blade screw. The tool I find most useful is the nail file. It makes short work of dressing torn finger nails."
4,Everything I Wanted Only It Was Late,"I got everything i wanted except it was late, but the owner said it was for personnel reasons. Also he gave me extra tweezers. It was a little smaller than I thought it would be. Overall I would give it 5 stars, only it was late so i'm giving it 4 stars. I suggest you try to get it from swissarmyknifepro he is the person who I got it from."
4,Neat way to replace a similar lost knife,I used a google search to find a replacement for my lost knife. This came from an airport security check and was no doubt taken from a passenger. It showed moderate wear but was otherwise functional. Was sold at an attractive price compared to new ones.
5,awesome knife,"this knife is awesome. the blade is sturdy, hard metal, and sharp. it has a tooth pick, tweezers, nice blade, mini scissors, a flat head screw driver, and a nail file. I've had it for about 2 years the the only thing that looks different is the ruby red plastic is a little scratched. all in all its an amazing knife i really recommend it."
5,Pocket this in your Pocket,This pocket knife was well received. It is used for personal and for business uses. It is small to fit in your pocket and not use up space. You can also put in on your keychain so it is handy for your needs. The color was perfect.
5,Perfect size for pocket,I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He loves it. He carries it on his key chain and the scissors and knife have already been used many times. Both are sharp and perfectly easy to use. It is perfect size to carry in his pocket. He has also used the nail file as a screw drive in a pinch. I would recommend this product. I wouldn't bring it as a survival tool but a great all around for small things.
4,"easy to use, and nice","this item was very nice. the knife was sorta dull though. when i got it, it had sand in it, and the blade was dull. so i was pretty disappointed. the tweezers and toothpick were pretty cool. i liked the scissors too. i recommend this item because it's cheap, and it's easy to use. hope i helped. :)"
4,so small but legit,the little pocket knife is great and what my friend wanted. i just did not get why it came in such huge packaging and it is a small product. perfectly fine though.
4,"Nice, but small",This knife was smaller than I expected but otherwise met my expectations; I would order a larger one next time.
5,Very handy / practical,I got one of these as a gift.Now I give them as gifts.Can't beat the quality.
5,Love this knife,"I had a green swiss army knife for twenty years but had it taken away from me at the airport. Apparently, my 10 years in the Navy plus my current position as a senior project manager with a security clearance isn't enough for the TSA to keep from taking my stuff. So - I had to buy another knife. Actually, I like this one more than the previous knife that I owned. It's a little thinner, has a place for a nice inscription (was thinking of inscribing my name on it), and just feels good in your hand. For what it is, it's a great product. Thumbs up to the vendor for quick processing too."
5,Great!,Great little product. I needed something small to fit in car door for occasional use. Does the job. Looks and feels durable too.
3,Compact Swiss Army pocketknife,the package we received contained the Compact Swiss Army pocketknife; but did not include the compact metal tweezers or plastic toothpick
5,"Great place to shop. Fast, Ontime and Good Shape","I received my two items very fast, ontime and in perfect condition. I have been using this type of small pocket knife for over 25 years and they have never failed me. They do get dull after a while so I like to keep spares around."
5,Perfect for Your Key Chain,"It's small and light (3/4 oz. -- 2-1/4"" long). Put it on your keychain. Except when going through airport security.All handy, especially the toothpick and knife blade. The scissors makes a good nail trimmer in a pinch.Somehow it stays extremely sharp after years of use. A great deal for 11 bucks."
5,Awesome Classic,These are always worth buying. You never know when they come in handy. And my girlfriend loves her pink one. It's the functional finishing touch on her key chain.
5,Swiss Army Classic Knife,"Excellent knife for those minor fingernail grooming, loose threads on clothes, paper cutting or other minor cutting chores."
5,Ditto to the positive reviews,"I won't repeat everything but want to add my amen to the positive reviews. Great product, great price, fast shipping, Swiss Army quality, convenient size knife, fun colors - nothing but good things to say. Everyone should have a Swiss Army Knife."
4,"A very nice knife, yet very small","I purchased this knife for my girl friend. It is obviously well made and is quite useful for everyday use. She liked it. But be careful, it's much smaller than expected. Almost as small as my index finger."
5,Tiny but useful,"I always carry multiple tools with me at all times, but I never leave home without this little knife. The file is used the most by me."
5,keychain,"I have been carrying this model of Swiss Army Knife on my key ring for years. I might not always use it for heacy duty job but its great for help with many issues. The toothpich is great after eating ribs, the tweezers for removing splinters, the knife for opening boxes to cleaning fingernails, and the scissors for cutting anything from silk to toenails. It lasts forever and the material is well made."
2,"Victorinox Classic SD, Stayglow, 58mm. #53208",Scissors are too think. Not as good as the old style. Definitely does not glow in the dark. Just bright yellow casing.
3,"Victorinox Swiss Classic SD Pocket Knife, Red",This Knife was not what I expected ! It was to small in size and not all blades were there as I expected
2,Very small,"Please know what you are buying! This product is tiny. Not a real knife. More like a toothpick and nail cleaner. Probably my own fault for not reading carefully, but this is not what I thought it would be."
2,We returned 2 of these knives un-opened and only got $8 or so for both,I had no idea we would not be returned at least most of the price for each knife. We got screwed. Careful people.
5,A Classic at a great price...,"This is a good starter Swiss Army knife. The blade is excellent and has stayed sharp for me for going on 10 years. Same with the Scissors, which I use all the time, and the tweezers...I have a slightly upgraded model that includes a very useful screwdriver tool.Enjoy!"
4,Great Gift,"It turned out really well. Great Christmas gift for my husband who doesn't really have any tools ect, but it was a LOT smaller than I was expecting it to be. But either way, it was satisfactory"
4,A miniature version of its big brother!,"Needed a new key chain version of the larger Swiss army knife in my tool box. Had to give up the older one b/c it was confiscated by TSA while boarding a flight (yes, you can't take the smaller version aboard aircraft any more than the larger versions!). This mini version has all steel blades which can be repeatedly sharpened, working scissors for cutting small items as needed, nail file, tweezers and fiber toothpick, all functional and durable. Amazon offers a variety of color choices (various pricing), plus, the Amazon price was great, too. It does ship separately from other Amazon items. Other web sites offer a lower price, but S/H prices were too much for such a small item."
5,Every Woman Needs This in Her Purse,"Regardless of what color you choose, a Swiss Army knife comes in handy for everything. I can echo each reviewer on this item and tell you how many times I've had to use it or a funny story on how grateful I was to have it. Just like a woman's wallet, keys and emergency items or even lipstick, this knife is a must in every woman's bag!! I had one for years growing up and when I had to leave on an international flight, I was asked to throw it out. I was crushed and never replaced it until recently. It could have saved me headaches!! Seriously, get this knife!! Just don't bring it with you to the airport ;)"
2,Review of tiny Swiss Army Knife.,"It wasn't clear (to me) that this was a miniature knife. I was trying to replace a small Swiss Army Knife, but this was half as big. Almost needed a tweezer to open the ""little"" blade. Not al all what I expected."
2,would not buy again nor recommend,item is very small. It looks like it could come from a cracker jack box. Maybe could give to my 3 year old grandson but I don't think his fingers are strong enough to pull out attachments.
4,Swiss Army knives,"Upon receipt of the knives, I realized that I had mistakenly ordered the wrong style. What I was trying to get was actually the Swiss Ambassador model, which is the next size bigger - they were to be executive gifts. So, an honest, human, mistake - no factor. These were promptly returned, and I might add, extra-promptly credited..., a very smooth and efficient transaction which is/was much appreciated."
3,Nice knives but almost too small,"We gave these knives to a Scout group and everyone loved their size and coloring. However, we had quite a few finger slices because the blade is so small and thin it's difficult to tell which blade is the sharp edge at times. Also they are a little tougher to open and close because everything is so thin."
2,Not as described.,"I already own the little knife that I just received, only with a red handle. I paid $8.00 for it last year. But the new white one I just received, that I paid $15.95 for, was described as having six stainless steel tools, instead of just four like my $8.00 one.The item description is wrong. The white model that I just received only has four stainless steel tools, instead of six, and there is no screw driver end on the tip of the nail file.The item description of the one I purchased is at:http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Swiss-Classic-Pocket-Knife/dp/B00004YVB2/ref=cm_rdp_productThe review I made is lumped in with others that have a different description."
3,Small,"Smaller than expected. If you're looking for a pocket knife you're better off going to a gun show. Comes with tweezers,toothpick, blade, scissors, and I don't remember what the other thing was. I got it for a gift and was shocked to see how puny it was. Victorinox is over priced, I got a much nicer knife for $6 at a local gun show and would highly reccomend looking other places first."
5,Perfect knife,"I purchased this knife for my son who is 11 years old. Perfect size for his hands, very sturdy, well made and easily fits in his pocket so he can keep it with him. Nice beginner knife."
5,Just as ordered,Arrived as ordered. No concerns. ALWAYS carry one of these with me. Have given plenty away at airport security.
5,Works well,WOrks well and lasts a long time. People have always borrowed from me in office. Need to always remember to remove it when travelling
5,Love these knives,"I probably use this little knife a half-dozen times per day. So small and light you don't even know that it's there. Love them, this is my 4th one over the years."
5,Ah memories!,"This is just like the one I had 20 years ago! Sturdy construction, very handy to have around and small enough to slip into your pants pocket. Hope it lasts as long as my last one did!"
4,Victorinox Classic,"I'll start by saying this knife may be small, but it is sturdy. It is perfect to carry on you keyring as it's small size won't make your keys excessively bulky and yet it has everything you'd need for day to day uses. It has a knife that is great for cutting small items (string and packaging etc) and although i've had mine for years it is still as sharp as the day I bought it. The scissors may be a touch fiddly but they are sharp and function well. The file and screwdriver have also come in handy at various times. These knives are always well made and their reputation is well deserved, they manage to be aesthetically pleasing, easy to use and sturdy all at the same time, no mean feat. A good entry level swiss army knife and perfect for small jobs whilst out and about.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,Great quality,"You can't go wrong with this little guy! The pink is a little different pink than I expected, but works tons better than the 20yr old one it's replacing!"
5,Exactly what it appears to be.,The Knife is of very high quality just as you would expected from Victorinox. The fit and finish are superb and the price is very reasonable.
5,Best Key Chain EVER!,"I've been using one of these for years & I bought this one for my teenaged daughter.The scissors are the key component to this item.Ever have little strings hanging from your clothes? Ever have a plastic or foil bag that you can't open without spilling its contents all over the place?I actually accidentally cut myself once on the knife - be careful!The nail file, tooth pick & tweezers bring this item to the top of my MUST HAVE list!"
5,Eye catching design - great gift!,"Purchased this as a stocking stuffer gift for my father. He keeps a knife on his key chain but the old one was falling apart. He loves this one and I think the design, colors, and quality are great - this little knife is a good value."
2,All show no go!!,This one is not as good as the other classic pocket knives. It doesn't have the tweezers or the tooth pick. For less money you can get one of the transluscent colored ones...much more appealing to the eye! Trust me I have one of these on every set of keys I own. This one just feels cheap!!
1,cheap look really,I know that for eleven bucks I should not expect much.But I am disappointed upon receiving it. The package looks cheap. To think I plan to give this out as a present for my niece. Not much of a good present.It does not come with a pouch.Just a knife in a thin plastic container and a thin paper box.
5,"Incredibly Useful, Small and Pretty","This particular model from Victorinox is truly a pretty and useful knife tool. Its small size makes it easy to carry anywhere. With toothpick and tweezers, two small blades and a scissors, the tool allows a good range of uses while being about the most compact knife one could have in their pocket.The knife is highly recommended for its versatility at a great price. You will be pleased with your purchase."
2,Small... too small,"I bought this item expecting something about the size of a small water bottle, but this is ridiculous! It's smaller than my pinky!I cannot believe this cost me 12 bucks, i am pretty unsatisfied but it's okay.."
2,Army Knife,"As soon as I opened this package my brother and I laughed our heads off because it is so ""tiny"". It is no larger than a toothpick - one could have purchased it out of a bubble gum machine for a dollar and I like a fool paid eight dollars for it - what a jip!!! Anyhow, I have it in my car - I might need it someday. I do not want to say anything negative but want to forwarn my buyers out there if you want a flimsey knife as big as a toothpick then this knife is for you. However, I think I wasted eight dollars on the only item I have ever purchased from Amazon that I did not care for and I think I had the wool pulled over my eyes. It looks unique in the picture but next time I need a knife I will be going to our local hardware store to purchase one. YOU HAVE BEEN ALL BEEN FORWARNED..."
3,Condition of the item was not exactly what was expected,Condition of the item was not exactly what was expected. It was listed as Very Good. It was acceptable but not very good. Then again for 99 cents what should you expect.
3,Victorinox Swiss Army Classic Pocket Knife (yellow),"It is great quality, however, I prefer a yellow color for bigger knife, it is too small for me"
2,Crummy knife,"The blade is too short to be effective. You're more likely to hurt yourself than anything with the tendency to fold on itself. The scissor spring also sucks, broke the thing within a month. Tweezers is easy to lose and toothpick is just retarded. Get a bigger knife."
2,Pocket Knife--just so so,"It looks nice.Good quality.However, it is awkward to use. Too small knife, not sharp enough."
5,Perfect Everyday Pocket Knife,"The pocket knife arrived exactly when it was supposed to, and exactly as described. I keep it on a key chain with my car keys and use it all the time. The scissors work perfectly and come in handy all the time. I have used the tweezers several times to pull out splinters. My only problem is that I use it so much I lost the tweezers.Overall, it is a great buy and I highly recommend it."
5,Victorinox Swiss Army Knife,"Great little pocket knife. Has a SHARP knife blade, nail file, small scizzors, toothpick and twizzers. what more can you need ?? All at a absolutely great price."
5,great little tool for the purse,"This tool is one that I would not be without in my purse. You can use it for a variety of tasks, and it is small enough to fit into a pocket."
3,Petite version.,"A lot smaller than I expected but still very nice. I wish I could give it ""3.5 stars"" or an ""almost 4 star"" because I like the shine and quality of the metal. However, I was expecting something more hand fitting. It feels awkward closing it, probably due to the size; I ended up nicking myself trying to close the small knife, but in honesty, I'm not used to pocket knives in general. On the plus side, it was very sharp."
5,Best Value,"If you're looking for the most compact Swiss Army Knife to hang from your key chain, this is the one for you. This is our 2nd, and the main blade stays razor-sharp an amazing long time despite constant use."
5,VERY handy,I keep this knife on my keys and use it all the time! I had to throw out the last one in order to get past security and into a concert (dangerous weapon I guess) and it was definitely missed until the new one arrived. I won't forget to leave it in the car before the next concert!
4,Inexpensive and Incredibly Useful,"Although this pocket knife isn't indestructibly built like the much larger multi-tools, its price and convenience make it a daily pocket item. It's incredibly small but manages to pack in a practical assortment of tools that I find myself using regularly. In fact, I can't think of a day when I don't at least use the knife to open a package or letter. But I also use the scissors for small cutting jobs and, combined with the file, nasty hangnails. I even pull out the tweezers now and then for a splinter. And although I thought it'd be nasty reusing a plastic toothpick, I do actually use it in a pinch (and let's face it, who has toothpicks or floss around when you've eaten that jumbo bag of beef jerky or corn nuts?).What's the best part? When (not if) I accidentally bring it to the airport, having it confiscated only sets me back a small amount. I usually turn around and order one as I wait for the flight."
5,SOOOOO COOOOOOL,"Wow- What fun this little knife is. I'v already used the little (very sharp) knife and the straight slot screwdriver several times. I'm a 47 year old female and never owned a Swiss Army knife - I'm so glad I did'nt settle for anything but a Victorinox. I purchased my pretty translucent blue knife along with the classic red one for my 19 year old daughter. She loves it and uses it, we both love that it's so handy right their on your key chain."
5,Best little pocket knife this size,"This little pocket knife is the best available in its size. It has all the necessities in a neat little package: Knife, scissors, file, tweezers and even a toothpick."
5,Great pocketknife,Great little knife to keep in your pocket or on your keychain. I use it all the time.
5,Very small and very useful!,"I have an old red Swiss Army knife that I cannot find anywhere that is almost identical to this one, but has a couple of extra tools including an adorable ruler. (for any of you men reading this, sorry, I meant USEFUL) It is a tiny bit heavier than this new one but considering the extra tools is well worth it. But I am satisfied with the new one as it has the main thing I wanted, the scissors, which are fantastic! You would never think something so tiny could be so strong. I have also used the tweezer a few times on my old one and again, it is so tiny but works great. While I haven't actually used this new one yet, the quality seems to not have diminished from my original one...like I said it seems exactly the same except for the reduced number of tools."
4,Good little knife,Bought this for my 10 y/o son's first pocket knife and it's the perfect size. Acceptable quality and well constructed.
4,"Great product, but different packaging","I ordered several of these in different colors to give one to each of my bridesmaids (it's an outdoorsy wedding in Alaska, so this fit the theme). The products were great and just as one would expect them to be. The only odd thing was that the packaging was different for a couple of them. So I might need to repack them in something other than their original boxes."
4,Not quite what I'm used to.,"I have carried the plastic version of this for many years. It is the most useful thing I own. I like to refer to it as my WMD (Weapon of Minimal Destruction).I almost ordered this one, until I noticed it is missing the toothpick and tweezers of the plastic version. I would miss the toothpick, especially the look on my wife's face when I offer it to her to use (Ewww, gross)."
2,Mr Lopez,"I like the knife you sent me. but it would be nice if on you product descritpion you include the dimensions, it was a surprise to me that the knife is only two inches long, but in your pictures theres is no way to tell.Other than that, everything ok."
3,Very small,I somehow didn't notice the measurements for this pocket knife. It looks very serious and professional but it is very small.
3,Tiny,"The quality is great, as usual - but it's tiny. I should have simply gone to Meijer or Target to see/touch/feel the knife before I bought it. :("
2,screwdriver tip missing,"my knife's nail file has a sharp edge as that of main blade, however it was mentioned in the product description that it has a screwdriver tip. i ordered it considering all of its features..i think its not worth if i dont get all the features mentioned."
2,Poor scissor feature,"Looked forward to replacing my Classic knife on my keychain because the scissor feature did not perform well. The two halves of the scissor bind and only open partially unless you manually assist it each stroke. So I ordered a new one. It arrived, incorrect style, quickly corrected by Amazon customer service. But the correct knife arrived and was a continued quality disappointment. The scissor feature on the new one is as bad as the old one. I have many Swiss Army knives and have previously believed their quality and customer service were first rate. I contacted SA and received a response stating they would look into my quality concern. A couple weeks went by and they replied that their scissor spring had not changed. Period. Hardly addresses the poor performance I reported to them. And the spring was never the problem anyway. The two cutting faces of the scissor are too tight.Bottom line ... Poor or deteriorating product quality and sadly poor customer service to match."
3,Swiss Army Knife,"Perhaps a good gift for someone to keep in their purse to use for opening things, but not very good for someone that uses larger knives for their projects. In other words, chick knife, not for men:)"
2,"Why, why, why?","Why would someone want a wimpy little knife like this...to skin an ant? I'm sorry, but I once owned one that was given out as a premium with some sort of promotion, and it was fairly useless except for cleaning underneath my fingernails. The casing cracked very quickly too. I think the cute li'l Swiss Army Classic Knife might be a good stocking-stuffer for a grade-schooler, but not much else. On the other hand, now THIS is a knife, and it's only a smidge over ten bucks:Trademark Global 15-Inch Jungle Master Hunting Knife"
2,Disappointing,The knife was disappointing but I probably expected too much considering the price. The scissors didn't work well at all. I got what I paid for !
1,picture is wrong and size is terrible for price!!!,"i can get same knife same manufacture but more tools and much bigger for same price at local store,but cant afford it now!!!rip off!!!"
2,Not what I wanted,This looked one on the amazon website and different when I got it. Useless for its price
2,"Don't be misled by the pic, this knife is too tiny.",This knife is tiny! I can't even peel an apple comfortably with it and my hands are not that big.
3,"ok knife, really small !","I thought this think was bulky and so was disheartened when I saw it firsthand. Should have imagined the dimensions beforehand I guess! Otherwise, the blades are pretty sharp and it comes in handy sometimes. Though the blades have become worn out a little! It also loses its sheen after a while but then its cheap!"
5,"overall a very functional, easy to carry knife","This particular pocketknife has become one of my personal favorites for many reasons. it's small size might make it appear to be a sissy, but it will out do any single blade or three-blade pocketknife of comparable dimension with it's extra utilitarian options.I find the knife very useful as a letter opener, and it's extremely sharp right out of the box. The scissors are always useful for many different reasons, and i use these often as well. The nail file, i don't use as much but occasionally, i will either use to (of course) file my nails, or to sand wood. As in every swiss army knife, the tweezers and toothpick are in this model and tend to be very useful for various reasons. To sum it all up, this is a great knife for the price and i highly recommend it"
4,Plastic shell is too soft,It is a nice knife. But the plastic shell is too soft. It is easy to get scratched.
5,Great to have on your key chain,Over the years I've owned several of these and I find it amazing how long they last and how handy they are. The blades are all very sharp and really don't seem to dull down. Although the scissors are very small they really come in handy and its alway great to be able to open something that's taped shut so the knife comes in handy too. These things are built strong and can put up with you putting them in your pocket with all your keys and change.
5,I can't leave home without it.,"Victorinox Swiss Army pocket knife is convenient and easy to carry in a ladies purse. Don't let the compact size fool you - each tool works effectively with a small pair of scissors, nail file, toothpick, knife and tweezers. This is one purchase you will not regret."
5,Swiss army pocket knife,"Everyone knows about swiss army knifes, I was just replacing the one I lost. Swiss Army brands are of excellent quality and very durable, I have owned one for many years."
5,Swiss Army Knife,"I have been a fan of Swiss Army knives since the early 1980s, when my sister brought me a Tinker from Switzerland. I have had several since then, replacing them only when the primary blade was almost worn away from sharpening. I particularly like the Super Tinker model, as it is a size that I can carry comfortably in my pocket, and it has the tools that I find that I need the most in a pinch. The tweezers represent the only defect in this knife as I see it, as they are almost useless.I have given several as gifts over the years, and everyone seems to be happy with them."
5,Nice to have,This little knife is the perfect size to carry around. I have already used the scissors on several occasions. Great to have in your purse!
1,"Beware, this is Cantonese / Mandarin dubbed. This is a Korean movie.","This and the sequel, Yellow Hair II are Korean films. This version is dubbed in Cantonese and Mandarin. The original Korean language version is available for the same price elsewhere."
4,Another good artist who should be recognized,"I'm the owner of the 1st version of this release. After seeing her open up for ""Res"" (her show was much better)in Atlanta a fews years back, I had this CD in my collection the next day. Yet, another former back-up singer for ""Erykah Badu"" (if you seen the Bag Lady video, she's the dark, slim, sexy one), Yahzarah has stepped up and done her own thang'. You should expect nothing more than just good music from this artist.... like you would from any other back-up singer of Badu. Blackstar is the stand-out track on this CD, but songs like: Guillotine, Natural, Feel Me and Same Page are not to be over looked.yall know my taste by now.... this one taste real good.oNe"
4,forget Ashanti,"wow....another cd that i found after looking at another cd on here (thank you Amazon). this sister can sing......my favorite songs are: Same Page, Rooftop, Blackstar, Love Is, Natural and if you can believe it Sally....i just wish that the sister got more promotion but im trying to turn people on to her. also check out Ledisi, Karen Bernod, Donnie, Conya Doss, Peven Everettonelove"
4,I love this cd,"On a depressingly slow Valentine's Day Sunday at work, this cd made part of that eight hours fly. She explained my whole life in the title track and she doesn't know me from a can of paint. I had to play that song four times back to back and discovered the tears were running down my face. Wow!"
1,"A good power consumption device, but nothing more","I tried this device in my garage to keep out insects and spiders. After several months, there is no detectable difference except for a slightly larger utility bill.I think the spiders are better at keeping out the insects.I definitely feel like a sucker for buying this."
1,"Do a search on Lentek and FTC or Lenteck and bankruptcy,","In 2002 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) charged Lentek with making false and unsubstantiated claims in advertisements for its electronic mosquito and pest repellers and its air cleaning products. Six months later Lentek signed an agreement with the FTC to stop making such claims. In 2003 Lentek went through bankruptcy and was taken over by Koolatron.The Centers for Disease Control(CDC) tested electromagnetic and ultrasound devices and found they do not work.Neither Lentek or Koolatron has produced studies showing the products work.Before buying, do a search on various combinations of Lentek, FTC, bankruptcy, Koolatron."
2,Outdated,"For its time I'm sure this was an excellent tool. I have one major complaint about it, which would have made me not buy it, but buy the newer 'Tibetan-English Dictionary' instead; the Tibetan script is hand-written. I'm guessing Goldstein's own hand? This makes many of the characters difficult to read and easily recognize. The new Tibetan-English Dictionary uses a standard font - much easier."
3,This is a weak compilation.....,"Slave is one of the greatest funk bands to exist, however this CD does little to demonstrate that. Granted, many of the biggest hits are on the first ""Best of"", but you could have added the better songs from this CD (removing the Steve Arrington Hall of Fame tracks) onto that one for a truly great disc. As with the first compilation, I think you short change Slave by including songs from the 'spin-off' bands, e.g. Steve Arrington and Aurra.With the exception of Party Lites, Baby Sinister, and For the Love of U, there isn't alot here. If Rhino really wanted to release a great Slave CD, re-issue ""Showtime"" (which I believe is one of the best funk albums, period). This CD is just too watered down."
4,Release Showtime!,"I Was glad to see this CD released, which includes cuts from Slaves earlier hits but I would really love to see ""Showtime"" released. That album makes my funk chops water.Sensational & Brilliant. I had the album, but a house fire destroyed it. Please release ""Showtime"" on CD,also ""Visions of the Lite"" & ""Bad Enuff"" would be nice."
4,I needed a musical fix,Boy I remeber this group from childhood and for the price to relive some good times from under the blue light it was more than worth it. In all honesty I think delivery time from amazon is biggest gripe...other than its awesome
3,Four-Movie Marathon: Clasdsic War Collection *Wake Island/ To Hell and..,"Battle Hymm....an old favorite. To Hell and Back....good movie. Did not like Gray Lady Down, only because it just wasn't my type of movie (submarines..stuck under the sea etc)"
3,Four-Movie Classic War Collection,"This Films are not what I would describe or list amongst "" Classics "" but at the price provide you with some average to good films. At the end of the day they are worth watching but only once, and at the low price still good value."
4,Four-Movie Marathon: Classic War Collection (Wake Island/To Hell and),"I enjoy glassic war movies, not gorey, but the movie keeps you involved.The movie has a good storey line, great actors.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys old classic movies."
5,Great movies...,"Classics all !!! Anyone who has a WWII collection...these would make a interesting addition. Wanted only ""Wake Island"" but the other two are classics in their own right."
4,Four Marathon Classiccollection,"Films my favorite. Did not look at Grey Lady Down;Good war films. They are classic Wake Island, o NHell and back and Battle Hymn-Theyweren excellent, and the casts were good and excellent and very goodb storiesGood action and some basic facts. They are well worthm looking at and if interested in WW!! and Korean war farly accurate.Story line pretty accurate in detail. aryan@maryknoll.org"
1,Not worth buying,"Three of these films should not even be released they are so bad. To Hell & Back of course is the exception but as I own it on a seperate DVD then this collection was a dreadful let down. I don't like damning a product, it gives me no pleasure however the other two folms in this set are truly awful, boring, dreafully acted & scripted. At least the price is good."
4,Great value for your money,"I gotta say I'm a war movie guy..everything from the Civil War to Iraq..I try and watch them all. Sure Ihave seen these four movies over the years but never owned them..until now. If I have to pick the best ofthe four I'd take Wake Island. Love those old William Bendix characters..""Yeah I'm from Flatbush and anybodywho talks bad about dem Brooklyn Dodgers..is looking for a fight!"". For the money their all worth the priceof the dvd."
5,4 movie marathon--wwII films,"I got into WWII old movies because I have been thinking of my late father who was in the Pacific Theatre all during that war. I am feeling quite tender about his contribution to the country's war effort, and I wanted to learn more about it."
3,4-movies,"To Hell & Back 5 StarsGray Lady 2 StarsWalke Island 4 StarsBattle Hymn 1 starFor 4 movies & that price, will it is hard to beat."
3,Not the greatest humidifier,"I bought this humidifier about a month ago. At first it was fine, altough I noticed that I was missing a round rubber ring that was to go near the lid on the watertank. The lid seemed to be working fine, so I thought nothing of it. Sure enough, thelid is now nearly impossible to twist off. I called Hamilton Beach and was told ""there's really nothing we can do for you,"" so I just continue to struggle with the lid everytime I refill the tank. I would shop around."
2,Noisy and Inefficient,"The Hamilton Beach humidifier looked like a great product at first glance - digital humidity controls, easily carried water tank, easy cleaning and disassembly.Unfortunately, the humidifier did not perform as well as I had hoped. Here's why:1) In order to maintain more than 25% humidity in my relatively small room, I had to keep the fan speed on high.2) With the fan speed on anything above ""whisper,"" the humidifier was too noisy to sleep.3) The wicking filter did not pull water up into the airpath very well - half the filter remained dry during operation.4) The water reservoir emptied in less than four hours.This humidifier might be good for someone hoping to increase humidity in a mildly dry environment, but was certainly not adequate for my apartment in New York this past winter."
4,Loving Relationships,The book was in ok condition - not in as good of condition as I thought but it was ok.
5,Finally...something great for beginning women golfers,"As a golfer, golf instructor and golf coach at the college level, I am truly appreciative of the work that Ann Kelly has put into this excellent book.Finally lady beginner's (we now need a 'blue' book for men) can really find out about the realities and nuances of this great game. This book is long overdue and will certainly lower the stress level and provide valuable encouragement for the lady beginner.I will be using this book in my College freshman classes and would encourage others including junior and senior high school Physical Education teachers to latch onto this book.It would certainly make a great gift and may create a solution for the beginning golfer in your life...a solution that will lower your stress level as well.Again, an excellent book and kudos to Ann Kelly for such a realistic presentation. I'm sure thousands of beginner's will echo this sentiment."
5,A Great Guide to Recruit New Female Golfers,"This is a great guide to introduce new female golfers to the sport, especially the ""40 something"" group who often feel intimidated by the protocol and mystique associated with the game. The book's brevity and practical information makes it an easy read for women who are juggling careers, families and other commitments. Having organized numerous casual golf outings during the past several years, I am all to familiar with the discomfort that new and even experienced female golfers share concerning their deportment and skill level on the course. Ann Kelly's guide helps to demystify a game that serves as both a great social and recreational outlet for women. I continue to recommend this book to all of my female friends who are considering taking up the game of golf or who are already hooked on the sport."
2,Waste of money,"I purchased this book at the same time as Golfing for Dummies, and found it to be a waste of my money. Golfing for Dummies covers the same topics, but more in depth. To me, this book didn't provide much real info, it glossed over most topics to quickly, which make sense as it's a very small book. I'd save your money, and just go for a more complete guide, it's worth it."
4,Naked on the First Tee,"Book is wonderful for all levels of golfers. I would like to contact publisher or author, but was not able to find WEB site listed on the back cover of the book."
3,Almost Naked After the First Tee,"The book was informative and helpful to a point. I would like to have seen a few more helpful hints on golf etiquette and a few more simple ""how to"" items. It was also geared toward people that will be playing at semi-private or private clubs. There are not many public courses that have washrooms, etc. on the course. I thought it may be a bit misleading in terms of what to expect for beginners on public courses. All-in-all, it was a good book, but not as helpful as I had hoped."
2,Fluff,"Cute, fluff, not even really that cute; semi-dismal stocking stuffer to go along with some used ladies' clubs!...What the heck; tee yer lady off big time! JZ"
2,2 Stars,My boyfriend gave me this book because I am a beginning golfer and I might say I was quite insulted. Of all the books he could have purchased he bought a little pink book called NAKED on the first tee. Thought it was pretty demeaning from the getgo. The book is very breif with little truly useful information. I went out and purchased a couple of books by Dave Pelz. They may not be directed to women but have plenty of useful information for both sexes and I don't have to look at anything PINK & NAKED.
5,Naked on the first Tee,"I knew nothing about golf. This book was short, easy to read and to the point. It gives a quick overview. Founded very helpful and encouraging to learn more about the game."
5,Fantastic book! Great for golf beginners!,"Fabulous book and an excellent introduction to golf...including various terminology, things you need and etiquette. I highly recommend it for the beginner and for those who want to learn to play in addition to those who want to become more serious about the great game of golf."
5,"Bach :the well tempered clavier, Edwin Fischer","Edwin Fischer is the most important Bach's interpreter on piano;this WCT is superb, you never heard any conterpoints like in this record."
3,This is NOT a Large print edition,"This is NOT repeat NOT a large print edition. My wife finally got tired of waiting for the regular one and had me order this one (she doesn't use a computer much). It is set in 11 pt Plantin font, which is probably what the others are, but it's regular print. I wanted you to know in case you were waiting for the regular print edition. As far as the book itself is concerned, my wife says not enough Louie, too much talking. People aren't as developed as in the other books. She does wish the authoress would tell in the current series what happened to some of the people introduced in these prequels but not in the current series. She feels the invention of him being a missing English Lord was a bit much."
1,THE CAT AND THE JACK OF SPADES,JUST WAS BROWSING FOR NEW MIDNIGHT LOUIE BOOKS WHEN I SAW THESE. MY MAIN COMMENT IS ABOUT THE REVIEW WRITTEN BY THE MAN WHO SAYS THIS IS NOT A LARGE PRINT BOOK. WHILE THIS IS NICE TO KNOW NOT ONE WORD ON WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT.
2,"Wow, this book was really depressing!","All I gotta say is this book was childish, boring, and a waste of time."
3,Lost my attention,"I read both other books in the trilogy and was pretty eager to read the 3rd. It was to me, boring. I read about half untill I got distracted by another book and forgot all about this one. I returned it to the library and I haven't wondered about the ending at all.If you did not read the other books you'll probably be very confused and bored reading this one. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it which is very unusual for me.I didn't enjoy it."
3,Not the same as the first...,"I was very excited to read the final book in the trilogy, only to be disappointed. The story didn't keep my attention, but I kept going because I wanted to see what would happen to the characters. The ending wasn't horrible but, I was left with questions. I want to know what will happen to Serle and will Arthur ever see Gatty again? Will Arthur marry Winnie? Everything felt rushed. I don't think Crossley-Holland took the time he should have to end the trilogy. And did anybody else notice that the first book was actually quite funny, while the other two were not?"
3,Weak finish for the trilogy,"The first two of this set were interesting and intriguing. ""What will happen next"" was constantly a thought. Any reader would wonder how the two Arthur's worlds would intersect, what would happen to our protagonist. This third book, by a respected and experienced children's author, is simply a time server, an incomplete story to fill a deadline. None of the story lines have any sort of climax; they just end. Lazy writing: quite frustrating to anyone who cares about books."
2,Disapointing end to series,"I think that this book's ending did not sum up the series well. The first and second books were great, but the third left questions like who does Arthur marrie? Or does Arthur ever see Gatty again? Does Serle come home from the crusade? I am hoping that Kevin Crossley Holland will write another book to answer all these questions."
1,Short life for a portable unit,"I purchased this item to place in my shed, which doesn't have an electrical outlet. I thought it would be perfect since it's portable and made by Lentek, a company that got great reviews for their other pest control products. However, this unit runs less than two weeks on battery. Not worth the money if you have to replace the battery every other week."
1,"Nice, If You need a Coffee Table Book; albeit a tiny one","This book is...well...tiny! Don't let the designation ""Hardcover"" fool you, it is miniscule. While the pictures are nice enough, there is no real depth to the information given. Only one page (about 3"" x 4"") per picture, so what can you expect. Also, for many of the pictures, the sources are either not given, or incorrect as I found out by looking the same pictures up in more extensive works. This book is fine if you want a very tiny coffee table book, but don't expect much in the way of scholarly, historical enlightenment from it."
3,"The stories are ok, but too out of date for my taste.","While I like old stories, Victorian for example, these accounts of Uncle Abner did not seem very much real to life. I sent the book to my cloud after only three or four stories. --Dr. William H. Stephens, retired editor"
5,Positively Amazing,A fabulous mix of intellectual wisdom and humor that directly violates society's morals.
3,unique...a nice addition but not a comprehensive reference.,"Like many Amherst books, this doesn't boast the best printing - the production and binding seems more like what you'd expect in the 1980s. The writing is not as lean and well organized as it could be. Expect something more like a narrative/essay than a start-to-finish how-to book. The book does not so much focus on using a digital camera as it does on shaping the image itself, mostly via Photoshop. It addresses some worthwhile topics that I have not so far seen covered elsewhere. If I were limited to only one book on digital photography, I would pick something different and much more comprehensive. The book does have some good points to make though."
2,Not a book about professional digital photography,"This is not a technical resource for professionals. I am a digital imaging specialist that has spent thousands of hours using Photoshop to retouch, color correct and manipulate images in Photoshop.I was very disappointed by this book, as I was hoping that it would teach me about which lights to use with digital cameras and how to use them to achieve pleasing effects.Although a few lights were listed in the photo captions, they were not discussed adequately.The book was written in a very readable style (I read it in less than 2 hours), but is too short (102 p + appendixes). Largely it is a book about Photoshop: basic color correction and sharpening of images, adding noise, and using masks to combine images on different layers.There is nothing wrong with the material presented, it just isn't about ""professional digital photography."" This is a nice book for hobbyists who want to know a little more about Photoshop."
2,Not impressed,The range did not work well in our building and would not make calls in most of the areas I used it.. I sent it back for a refund.
5,Who stole the Wizard of Oz?,"Who stole the Wizard of Oz? To find out you'll have to read it. The book is about a girl and her frind ,Toby .When they are asked if they stole five very valueable books they say no. Now they are they will try to find the culpret.They find the books in...well that would ruin the surprise for you woulden't it"
5,Who stole The Waxerd of Oz,"The book Who stole The Wazerd of Oz by: Avi. Is a very good book. The book Who stole The Warzerd of Oz is about a girl named Becky and her brother Toby, they are looking for clues to fine The Wazerd of Oz. There was a book sale well Becky and Toby go to find The Wazerd of Oz. You will have to read the book to fine out how really did stile stole The Wazerd of Oz.(...)"
5,Read and you will see Who stole the booK!,This is a very intriguing and exciting story. It is a mystery book that keeps you guessing who actually stole the book. I would definetly recommend it!
3,It was ok.,"In the book Who Stole The Wizard Of Oz, Becky and Toby try to figure out who stole some very expensive books from the library. The police think that Becky stole them, but Toby does not. The whole book is about Becky and Toby who are trying to figure out who stole the books, but I'll leave it up to you to figure out Who Stole The Wizard Of Oz!"
3,One and a half thumbs up!,"This is a very good book; I liked it because it had good details and similes. If you like well-written mysteries but you don't like them too scary, then this book has your name all over it! I personally don't think it has enough suspence; not that you shouldn't read it, actually I really do think that you should!I reccomend this book for 6-8 year olds."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased Carlson's short stories based on rave reviews and I even liked the sample portion of the Governor's Ball. I bought the book to finish the ending of Governor's Ball only to find there was no ending. The story was unfinished, loose ends. A story must have a plot, a beginning, middle, and an end. Characters must interact in a meaningful way, settings should have power, and a conflict resolved should be featured. I found none of the staples of a short story. Rather, I would call Carlson's pieces, Vingettes. They have none of the qualities of a Welty, Faulkner, Hemingway, London, etc. They simply have one character, the author who puts in himself in one situation after another without creating the effort that goes into a story unified by plot, character, and conflict and resolution. Big time disappointment. A literary sketch is hardly a short story, the most difficult of all genres other than poetry."
1,Generously gave it 150 pages of reading before giving up,"I kept reading and reading, thinking sooner or later, I would enjoy one of the stories. I labored through 150 pages before giving up. Maybe a story in the latter part of the book was good. This author has notable and envious publishing credits.This book had great reviews. So I trusted all that. I was hungry for a good read, or even one ah or a smile, a little giggle, or a revelation on the human condition large or small. None of that was there for me. After 150 pages, I decided I had let this book waste far too much of my life."
3,Good book if you are an expert!,"Before start reading this book, read ""Uderstanding Digital Signal Processing"" by Lyons first."
4,arrived late,"it was the first time that an amazon product took more than two weeks to arrive. I had to borrow my friends' books to solve my homeworks! but as promised, it was new :)"
2,Is something wrong?,"I ordered this book twice from Amazon (new and used)! I did not received this book yet?Why?Maybe is something wrong written in this book!Please, pay attention:Product DescriptionRepresents the most comprehensive treatment available of neural networks from an engineering perspective. Examines all the important aspects of this emerging technology. DLC: Adaptive filters.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."
2,Not a bad reference book.,"This book looks very impressive, but if you try to understand it you'll find it very mechanical. There is not much motivation behind the many pages of formulas and derivations. I'm not even sure how many people actually read those derivations becuase even in its 4th edition the book and its solution manual both have many typos (see, for example, equations 8.11 and 12.5). Even the problems are more focused on derivations than on numerical examples. This is a good cookbook if you just want to implement an algorithm or find some pointers to the original research papers. Like many other reviewers, I beleive that engineering textbooks are losing their depth and becoming more and more like instruction manuals."
3,A Recipe Book,"The book is sound, but I have to agree with others here. Formulas, procedures are presented without an intuitive sense of why things turn out the way they are, or even from the beginning of derivations. Good to implement mechanically all those algorithms without proper understanding.As it is usually the case, in this very important subject, one has to learn from many sources."
3,Cook Book,"Simon Haykin's Adaptive Filter Theory is a perfect example of everything which is wrong with modern engineering text books. It begs the question of why great educators like Van Trees and Kailath write out of print books, and Sallys like Haykin, Kay and Papoulis can make it to third editions. As a cookbook, one can't do better, but then again, what is science without proper motivation? Even when Haykin attempts to illustrate the theory, he adopts the uninsightful but straightforward mechanics of undergraduate linear algebra, and then again, why did it take hundreds of years to develop these ideas if Haykin has a 3 line proof. The book should be re-titled ""Why I'm so smart"" By Simon Haykin."
2,my product arrived damaged,"I'm sorry but I'm not happy to pay almost (+-$150) + shipping and taxes (+$24) for a damaged book (Clearly not a cheap book), I bought the product like two weeks ago and today when I went to look for the package and I opened the box I found one of the books was damaged. First the corners damaged then the cover with details. The box was not the problem Seem the one who packed the books didn't take care about it. I wanted a new book not a ""condition: good"" book in that case I would bought a n used and cheaper book. Next time please cover the book with plastic to avoid damaging the product."
3,Kitchen Caddy,"A leg from of the caddy broke off when the gift recipient took it from the gift box, and the scent of the products is not very pleasant. It is not a very high quality product."
3,Interesting!,"I had heard a lot about Julie through friends who had been to her live shows. The album didn't stand up to the hype for me. I give her credit for putting together a bold blend of genres reggae, funk, soul and jazz, but it's been done before to greater effect. I will wait for the live album."
2,Horrible,"This is nothing like her Conscious CD. This one must have been rushed, or she must have been on a new age jazz trip. Yuck. Don't waste your money!"
3,A Decent 'Second' Stereo,"Don't fool yourself; this is no Bose Wave Radio. Comparisons between the two are foolhardy, and with such disparate price points, such comparisons shouldn't be made.With this being said, the SR-L35B is a solid backup stereo to help fill an office or kitchen with enjoyable FM music. The unit captures high-mid range tones quite well, it's digital tuner extremely accurate to signal acquisition. Moreover, the sturdy, SR-L35B is an aesthetically-pleasing unit that looks spiffy wherever it rests. Finally, iPods sound clear through the rear audio in jack.Earlier criticisms, however, are accurate. The non-configurable bass resembles that emanating from the speakers of a '65 El Camino. So much so that AM radio becomes almost un-listenable due to this formality. Talk radio listeners: you've been warned. Second, the CD loading function is as annoying as advertised. Patience is a virtue when loading/swapping discs."
3,Not great but not bad.,"I bought this in August 2005. My main gripe is that you can't see the clock when the radio or a CD is playing unless you get out of bed, walk acrosss the room and press the ""Display"" button. Couldn't they have put a ""display"" button on the remote? I don't mind the slighly heavy bass. I notice it only when someone is talking. And I wish it had the depth of sound I got from my old Panasonic. Would I buy it again? Maybe. There isn't much choice today in clock radios at a reasonable price."
4,A Great Superman Story,"Superman: Godfall is one of the best books I've read in a while, and definitely one of the more reader-friendly titles. I say that because the foreward fills you in on what's been going on in the Superman universe with a nice synopsis, so that you step right into the story without missing a beat. This nice addition, along with the cover gallery and pencil sketches, make this as complete a book as you'll find. Halfway through the story, you might feel a little confused, but like good comics always do, the last issue of two answers the questions from earlier on. Also, and this must be said, Lyla is an AWESOME character with a great backstory that I would love to see in future issues. In case you haven't gotten the message yet, pick up this book!"
3,Looking for BRIGHT *GOLD* PERMANENT MARKER?,The gold in this pack is dull. But the silver is very shiny. Only disappoint was the gold. I wanted to gold edge a deck of playing cards but the gold does not shine too well! But the silver is very bright and excellent.
2,Good until...,"These sharpies worked pretty fantastically until I capped them the first time. The tip dried up and now nothing else will get past the dry tip. The color is pretty great, when it works, though. Not really sure how to salvage these, so I just threw them out. Maybe there is a way to fix them, but I wouldn't buy them again."
1,bad idea disney .,"Why would I buy a power ranger dvd with only one episode on it ? Note : Thats what 22 minutes of run time is , one freaking episode . I rather buy the whole series as one whole box set ."
2,Too disconnected for me,"I've been trying to slug through Half Hours With the Best Thinkers. It basically consists of excerpts from works by Confucius, Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, etc. This was a mistake: while I've read some of the works included here, and was just hoping to discover some others that appealed to me, jumping in the middle isn't conducive to that like I had hoped it would be. The ""mental whiplash"" between one reading to another is just too great for me. I need time to find the rhythm of the writing, to really be able to follow the flow of the writer's thoughts. And each excerpt really isn't half an hour long (except for some of the more convoluted writings, like Aquinas's). Somebody else might enjoy it, but not me."
4,B movies are what they are,"why do some folks not get that a B movie is what it is? You are not going to get top shelf drinks at a dive bar; you will get Schnapps and Miller Hi-Life. So it goes with movies. Shlock is a main part of the appeal. I have not seen this movie in many moons but it's unforgettable in its post-Manson dangers-of-LSD 'message'. Bald killers on acid. If that does not meet your demented needs for 70s era insanity, nothing will."
4,Blue Sunshine Radiates..,I bought only because I am a big fan of Mark Goddard and was pleasantly surprised. Horror/sci-fi/suspense/just enough gore.... It delivers. Not typically my cup of tea but I liked it and my husband thorougly enjoyed it.
3,Fun stuff,"Fun, if you don't take productions values, etc too seriously. Anyone saying that the movie stinks because of ""bungled direction"", etc, either wasn't old enough in the 60's and 70's to appreciate what this movie is, which is pure, unvarnished B grade fodder. I admit I'm biased, I love this kind of schlock.However, the premise is an interesting one, and Jeff did a halfway credible job (In B horror flicks this is high praise)directing it. What amazes me is seeing it again after all these years and realizing that the cast is chock full of yet_to_be's and used_to_be's...something I wouldn't have realized while watching it for the first time in a German Student Art-Film House. Speaking of which, I first saw Assault on Precinct 13 there, another nifty lil low budge worth checking out."
3,"""There's a bald maniac in there! He's going bat s**t!""",A bunch of college kids did some acid called Blue Sunshine now 10 years later the acid is making them go bald and freak out complete with the killing and the stabbing and the blood. Sadly there's a lot of talking and not enough freakin'!At the original freak out a innocent bystander gets blamed for the murders and now - on the run - he has to find out what caused his friend to freak out and obviously that takes a lot of talking. Even with the excessive talking BLUE SUNSHINE is still worth watching just to laugh at the freak outs.
4,Totally Enjoyable!,"This book caused some embarassing moments for me. I reccommend this book to avid romance novel readers. I also suggest that they read this in the privace of their own home, not at work. This book made me laugh on quite a few occasions, especially when the character Shayna would do something klutzy. I think this book will definitely bring quite a few smiles to the faces of everyone who reads it."
3,THE PRODUCTS WORKS BUT WITH SOME DRAW BACKS,THIS PRODUCT DOES DO THE JOB IT IS SUSPOSE TO BUT THE FILTERS DON'T LAST AS LONG AS THE BOOKLET SAYS IT SHOULD AND FOR THE PRICE IT SHOULD LAST A LOT LONGER! I ALSO THINK IT IS TO NOISY ON HI BUT IS PERFECT ON LOW.
5,Hamilton Beach Air Filters,"Very satisfactory product, best price, shipping was timely, good packing for shipment prevented any damage to product. I will order through Amazon again."
1,replacement filter does not perform like original,"The original filter that came with the unit worked fine and it was easily able to humidify two large rooms. This replacement filter, however, does not seem to wick water very well. It can barely keep a 17x12' room at 30% humidity with the door closed, windows shut and heat turned off. And it's in the 40s -- not even very cold out. In fact, it wicks so badly that for the water level to change in the tank I have to flip the filter every hour or so. I called Hamilton Beach but they said it wasn't their problem because the filters are manufactured by 3M. Of course, this is the only filter offered for use with this unit."
2,Chemical Smell!,"I have been ordering these filters for the past few years, but in the last few times when I used the filters, I smell some sort of chemical smell sometimes, when I wash the filter and use it again, the smell goes away for a while and again it comes back.Even the very recent one that I ordered has the same problem, very disappointing."
4,Replacement filters for Hamilton Beach 05518,Entirely satisfied with these filters. Bought the cheaper replacement filters first and they just don't do it. Recommend spending the $15 and getting these good ones.
3,Humidifier Replacement Filter for 05518,This is the 2nd time I have ordered this product through Amazon.com. I have a Hamilton Beach humidifier and need the replacement filters for it to run efficiently. This filter works fine and does the job that I need done.I am quite pleased with Amazon.com and the timely way that it gets product to the consumer. Thank you for that.Linda Zachary
2,Needs replacement often,"We bought our humidifier two months ago and have already gone through two filters. Despite the fact that we change the water in our humidifier daily, the filter quickly start smelling very moldy. It also seem to disintegrate rather quickly.I'm happy with the Hamilton Beach humidifier, but wish that the filters lasted a little longer."
3,"Grows mold easily, but is a good humidifier","Just a warning to those of you who are like me and aren't the most meticulous keepers of humidifiers: the large filter grows mold very easily. A previous reviewer noted that you should keep the filter wet, but in my experience that just grows mold. I've had to toss 2 filters for that reason. At this point, I've switched to Ultrasonic humidifiers because I'm afraid to use the previously moldy cool mist one (esp with the dusty fan)."
1,Life too short,"This filter doesn't last as long as I expected, and the humidifier is very very noisy..."
3,Dry,This book is not a very exciting read. Some chapters are very wordy and go on for a lot longer than they should. Overall it gives a great grasp on the concept of global communication but could have used some better editing.
2,Beware,"Extremely brittle. Good only for leafy vegetables and soft fruits. Sharp, but definitely not worth the money. There plenty of better products."
5,The best,I have been slowly adding to my Shun knife collection. These are the best knives I've ever had. They stay super sharp (watch your fingers) with only brief sharpening required.
1,Office Depot and This Humidifier Failed Me.,"The humidifier broke in less than 2 days of owning it. The mist simply wouldn't come out. After days of trouble shooting, cleaning and reading instructions, it was official. The product failed me.I called [the retailer] to return it and they said they would send me an email with further shipping/return instructions. They never did. I called to ask about the follow up email from them and they said it wouldn't do any good since I missed the 30 return date??? I tried to explained that I tried to return it in the 30 days, but never got the email from them. It didn't matter-so now I'm out $40 bucks and no humidifier.For the record, this isn't the only product I've ordered from [that retailer]. I also ordered an Epson Printer and that broke in 4 months. I've now learned not to order or purchase anything from these merchants and am really bummed that they have my money and I have nothing but broken machines."
5,An Efficient Appliance!,"Very impressed by the performance of the Honeywell. There are no worries with this unit. It purifies the water (unlike cool air units) and there are no filters to worry about. Just give it a simple cleaning every week. What a relief after my old cool air humidifier, it was hard to clean and needed hard-to-find replacement filters.Oh, and don't worry about the 350 watts! That energy is added heat in your home and helps to reduce heating costs."
2,Needs improvement.,"I write this review after 2 months experience with this humidifier. It has several weaknesses that need to be improved.(1) It's made of plastic that is too thin; my first one was broken in two places and needed replacement.(2) The automatic humidity control doesn't work well; either it stays on for hours and hours, or stays off for hours and hours.(3) The tank dribbles water on the floor each time you refill the machine.(4) If you keep the machine on the floor, neither the dials nor the indicator lights can be read from above.The machine is extremely quiet, and does humidify the air. But it doesn't control itself well, is not very well designed, and does not appear durable. Someone needs to make a better humidifier than this!"
5,5-stars for quietness - great for small bedroom,"The only space for a humidifier in our tiny bedroom is right next to our bed on the night table or next to it on the floor. I'm a very light sleeper and after trying a more modern Honeywell HWM450, which I returned because of the noise (even on low setting), I got this one, it is truly quiet and I can't hear it. This model is a bit outdated, and not very well-made, it has this ""cheap"" feel to it, but it does the job well so far, goes through almost entire tank per night on high and half tank on low. Cleaning is not bad, the only dislike - tank opening is too narrow to clean the inside using your hand. If you don't care about the noise - get the Honeywell HWM450. If you need it to be very quiet - get this one."
4,"Good product, but humidistat not quite up to snuff","This humidifier is indeed quiet, easy to clean, and very quickly moistens up any room. However, in my unit, the humidistat doesn't seem to have any correlation with the actual humidity in the room, and this causes the humidifer to sometimes operate when the room is very wet, and not sometimes operate when the room is very dry..."
5,Excellent,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Quiet and does a good job. It covers my larger living room with no problem, even bought one for my mom."
2,Good start...........bad finish,"I bought this primarily for the 3 gallon tank capacity, and the fact that it required no filter. The unit worked great out of the box. However after a week of usage the heating chamber began to warp. I continued to use it until it reached a point where it no longer looked safe. I have returned it and I am waiting to hear from the supplier regarding a replacement. I do no recommend this humidifier."
1,A Product Made with Cheap Material and Labor,"I bought 2 of the Honeywell model for 2 separate bedrooms last winter. They both broke down before the winter season ended. It may have something to do with the electronics inside. Once they are broken they can't be easily fixed. If you want something that will work for one season, try something cheaper like Vicks. For this kind of price for one season, I certainly wouldn't do it again with this model or brand."
2,Worked well while it worked,"The good- Very quiet, at first (more on that later)The bad- Steam comes out at a low rate, even at the high setting- Needs frequent cleaning due to scale, especially on difficult to clean heating elementThe very ugly- After 3 months of use has become very noisy, to the point that we are rarely using it. Quality control is not what it needs to be."
4,Using it for a second winter- still ticking!,"I agree the plastic is not the most durable but I like it all the same. It pumps out steam like nothing else! I also have a Vick's warm mist humidifier that holds less water and in comparing the two, I'm less impressed with the Vick's because it's noisier. The Honeywell one is quiet to the point where you have to look for the steam to know it's working sometimes! It's a bother to clean and sucks electricity to boot, but I'm willing to make sacrifices for healthier breathing! (Note: I went through many cold mist humidifiers with nasty mildew-stained filters before I found this one! This is a keeper!)"
2,worked but not lasted long,"survived a few years, but the heating coil broke down and switch doesn't work any more.hard to clean since beginning, while my other humidifier still works fine. I guess you buy what you pay..."
3,works well -- when it works,"When the humidifier works, it works quite well, and really pumps the water into the air. Living in Denver, which is quite dry, this is a good thing!My main problem with the machine is that I cannot just turn it on, and assume that it is going to work. I sometimes have to ""trick"" it into working. I have to turn it to a low level, then let it sit for a while, then turn it to a higher level to get it to work. It sort of seems like it was designed by Microsoft. I discovered this trick in the user's manual. I would be nice if I could just turn it on, and not need to think. But once I discovered this trick, it works great."
1,Great while it worked!,The heating coil broke after only a month of use! What shoddy craftsmanship. I'd like to buy another humidifier but I won't be buying Honeywell!
1,Questionable unit,"I recently purchased this unit but found that it can't humidify a 168 sq ft room much less the advertised 700 sq ft. After writing a bad review 'allergy be gone' contacted me and said they would make it right if I removed the bad review. I did and then it took me 10 days before I could contact any one and when I did they said if I sent it back to them the would replace it. It would cost me $14 to send it back and I don't think the unit is worth another $14. Also Honeywell told me they have not made this unit in over 3 years, so these are very old units.. Not worth the time and money. Don't do it."
1,Piece of Garbage,I'll make this short and sweet. I'd give this zero if I could. I bought two of these based on good reviews and Honeywell's good name. They both worked for less than a week before dying on me. Spend your money elsewere.
1,It came broken from Office Depot,"Our order went through Office Depot, which we thought would be reliable. It arrived only 2 days after we have ordered the product, but it came broken! And we still had to pay shipping."
1,"The best when it works, but......","It only lasts one winter. The warranty doesn't help much. I am going to ship it back, but it cost another 20 dallar shipping fee. I don't know what to do if it breaks again..."
4,Hot Humidifier,"This humidifier is very effective and I prefer it very much to my cool mist humidifier. During the winter months I like to leave it on the lowest setting at night. Because I live in Colorado, the air can be very dry and having this humidifier is almost a necessity. I give it four stars simply because I am unable to leave it on all of the time because the air becomes much too moist and becomes slightly uncomfortable. But it's tough to criticize this machine for doing it's job too well!"
3,Costly to operate,"This is a nice humidifier. It's quiet and works well. I particularly like the removable tank. However, two problems kill it for me:1) The humidistat on my unit does not seem to work at all. The indicated level varies from minute to minute in a seemingly random fashion. Given the size of my apartment, I've found that it's best to just keep the unit running all the time.2) However, I recently discovered that this thing uses about 350 Watts of power while running. With constant use at 8 cents per kWh, that's more than $20 a month!"
3,Works Great - Except for the Humidistat.,"I like the warm mist humidifier. My only complaint is that the humidistat doesn't seem to operate properly. I returned the first one for this reason, but the second one operates no differently. If I turn it to the left - per the instruction - until the light comes on, it shuts itself off, but never comes back on. If I nudge it to the right, it will come on again, but it doesn't shut off. I've spoken with Honeywell twice regarding this, but they had no solution. I'm planning to keep it, however, because it works quite well in spite of the humidistat problem."
4,disburse out lot of water in short period.,3 gallon water dissapears in about 12 hours when it's on full blast and it's amazing where it's all gone. I would've imagined it would make floor and furniture spaces humid and wet. but no. it's almost hardly noticeable but definitely helps my sinus to breath better. I only use brita filtered water. so I don't have to clean up mineral deposit build up on the heating element. Yeah.. material used is definitely the cheapest plastic available on the planet. It probably won't last. but then it's 32 bucks to begin with so I'm not complaining. just another gadget from disaposable age.I'm thinking about getting another one to really feel the humid.
2,big dissapointment!,I bought two for about one month ago based on the reviews but the black metal (for heating water) already is chipped with rusts.I don't know what the problem is and it looks bad.A big dissapointment and plan to return them.
2,Cheap,"I got some use out of this product, but if I could do it over again I would pick a different humidifier, even if it was more expensive. It seemed to me that the humidistat never worked properly. It either would never turn on, or it would just stay on all the time depending on where the dial was set. Besides that, it worked well for me for one or two winters when I was using very purified water. I moved and started filling it with plain tap water, and shortly after that it broke. The fill tank LED stays lit even if the tank is full. I'm moving again, and I'm throwing this humidifier away and buying a (hopefully) better model when I get settled in."
1,Pass on it,"We bought this and it lasted about 8 months. I was disappointed to say the least. It seemed to work great until one day it just would not do anything. I examined it, but could not find any things to suggest what the problem was. I could not even find a blown fuse to replace. While it worked it was also somewhat of problem cleaning the heating element (it rusted). Definitely pass."
2,"It works, barely.",This product works great sometimes. It is however very finiky and requires a lot of coddling to keep it going.
5,Great Humidifier,"I've owned several humidifiers through the years, and this one is as good as the others. Very quiet operation which produces a fine mist. The tank is an ideal size to run through the night. Warm mist humidifiers have a tendency of burning out, but so far so good. The only problem is finding one in stock."
4,Bearing info,"The part was shipped quickly and was in perfect condition. The abs sensor was not the correct one and we had to reuse the original one which is cracked, wish they would send me the correct one."
5,Full circle,"Nina comes full circle with a combination of her power-diva attire and Vedic chanting, a driving force in her life, which (so far) only sporadically surfaced in her previous work. Delivery from the heart, beautiful voice and instrumentation. Disc one is Nina & party playing a sparkling set in the studio, disc two contains a spirited live concert that feels like a day in the park. The icing on the cake is a short but satisfying film with footage of the concert. Expect to experience Krishna full-on, fantastic release!"
4,"Sweet Lovers, Pleasant Read","Deke and Wyatt fall in lust at a time before homosexuality had been defined, but they knew enough to know they had to run away from hate. Through some incredibly tough and at times moving experiences that they shared, their lust turned into mutual love and need. The book has several good characters in addition to the two lovers, especially Lettie and her kids, who join Deke and Wyatt into forming an unusual family, especially for the 19th century Old West. There are several historical discrepancies in the book (e.g., no white folks in the Dakotas in 1823, and damn few in California or Arizona in the 1850's, the story happening during the time of the US Civil War yet that cataclysm never mentioned in the story, etc.). And the ending is simply not credible. Still, the love affair is warming and charming, the sex pretty good, and it left this reader feeling pretty good about the book. Not deep or intellectual, but a pleasant read."
1,where's the erotica?,"Uh, no.Deke is a ""nomadic rancher"", going from places to places looking for jobs on the farm. He's finds one and has the hots for the boss' son, Wyatt. When they're caught in the middle of an action, they flee for safety or else face a lynching.Eventually, they flee to a lone woman's land (and her kids). From there, things just really flopped. The sex acts is pretty redundant. Therefore, there's no erotica in there. It's just boring and weird."
1,Don't waste your money; one of the biggest pieces of garbage I've ever bought.,"Simply put, this thing is terrible. The first one I bought wouldn't fax anything. Since I really wanted this to work out, I returned it and bought another one. That one worked, but the transmission time for three sheets of documents was interminably long. Worse, the jack made my fax machine emit a scratchy sound. Unacceptable."
5,Wireless phone jack,I found this product to work very well for my fax machine. It was very easy to set up.It worked just like it said it would.I would recommend this product for a hassle free experience. I would purchase again.
2,Doesn't work,I try using it on my fax machine and my machine and it will start ringing without any calls coming in I try an old GE one I have connected to my direct tv and no problems
2,junk,"noise on the receiver, touch lamp goes off and on when on phone, phone rings when talking on other phone"
3,"Hit or Miss, worth a try...","Seems like a great idea to avoid unsightly (and potentially -if you have an elderly dependent- dangerous) long wires. So I gave it a try.The unit is very well and solidly built (if a bit bulky), and a snap to set up. Plug the base unit into an electrical plug close to your main phone line, and run a phone cable from the phone line to the base unit. Do the same with the sattelite unit, and connect the phone to the satellite unit - you are done. You will get dial tone.What will depend a lot on your wiring, I assume, is sound quality. It was horrid in my environment - heavy static, a very loud and variable background noise and muffled voice to top it off. It was unusable in that environment. I don't blame the product - I am sure it depends a lot on how the wires run in a place. Seems worth a try, even though it didn't work for me."
3,Good for satellite receivers,"I purchased this product to connect my new Dish Network DVR Receiver to my phone line and it worked great for about 3 years. After about 3 years, the wireless receiver stopped working and I had to get a new one."
1,Don't waste your money,I purchased this product hoping I could use it for my Fax machine. I only send a couple of Faxes a year and got tired of moving it to a room with a phone jack. I made this purchase and tried it in different wall outlets. I barely get a dial tone through all the static. I tried to send a fax but the signal wasn't clear enough to work. Don't waste your money on these.
1,Do NOT recommend this item.,We recently purchased this item and the Extension Unit has already quit working. I bought a longer phone cord and hooked my equipment directly to the phone jack instead. This is the second unit we have had problems with. I do NOT recommend buying this product.
2,Static,"I bought this item as a phone jack to use for my usb fax modem for my computer. It's very easy to set up, you won't have any problems with that. Just follow the easy instructions.The problems is, that when I start my fax program (Windows Fax and Scan), and it finally starts to dial I have to resend the fax 2 - 3 times before it actually gets sent. I can hear it, it has a lot of static or the ""signal"" (for lack of a better word) isn't strong enough. I know it isn't my usb data-fax-voice modem because when I plug that directly into a wall jack it works fantastic. But doing that is not an ideal option for me.I don't fax very often so I guess I'll have to make do. So I have to click resend a few times, it's easier than moving my whole setup.I can't imagine using this as a landline phone!"
1,Didn't work well for me,"This did not work for me and I have returned it and I'm waiting for a confirmation of my refund. The seller was very cooperative in emailing me a postage paid return authorization. The phone connection was very, very noisy. It might have been barely usable for a telephone conversation but I was hoping to use it on a TIVO and the connection was so poor that the TIVO would not connect. I had to set it up to tie into my home wireless network instead."
1,Not suitable for voice calls in an apartment,"Even after reading some of the negative reviews, I decided to buy the Jack extension to put a phone in a room without a phone jack. Worth a try right? However, much like the other reviews here, there is a loud buzzing noise whenever I try to make a call making it unsuitable as a replacement for the phone jack.I live in an apartment with plenty of surge protectors and things plugged in. I did not test any functionality for a DVR or fax."
4,Great for Fax,"I use it only for a fax machine and it's great never had a problem with it.I only gave it 4 stars since it's made to use for a phone as well, and I can hear the static through the fax machine (it doesn't ruin the fax at all), so it wont do that great for a phone."
3,Not my cup of tea,Reasonably good product and quality. Great service as arrive fast. Reasonable price. Sometime having problem with using. I may not recommend this goods if I have choice to buy.
2,Worked for about 14 months,Used it with Dish receiver to avoid $5.00/month charge. I have been through 2 sets of these and it would have been cheaper to pay $60/year is Dish charges than buy 2 sets of these in 14 months.
1,poor sound quality - background noise,The product is easy to install but quality is severely affected by background noise. I tried in different outlets around my house and always got the same effect. I don't recommend this product.
1,Returned this awful purchase,"Too bad zero stars is not an option. These did not work nearly as well as I hoped they would. They carried the phone signal to a room where there is no wall jack, but the static on the line was so bad that it was impossible to hear the person on the other end. I'm usually inclined to give things a chance, but these were so awful that I didn't even want to bother trying a replacement set & just returned the original set instead. We now have a 25-foot exposed phone line running down the hall instead, and even with the potential tripping hazard, I prefer that solution. Definitely recommend you find another way to extend your phone signal!"
1,Too much background buzz,"I wanted to move my base station so I used an old RCA wireless jack that i already had. It worked fine, but had not caller ID. I bought this set to get the caller IS and it is unusable due to loud buzz on the line when dialing and talking. The base unit and receiver unit are on opposite sides of the same wall. I tried relocating both the base and the extension, but got the same result."
2,Not what you think it is...,"While these devices do transmit a signal without an additional wire between the base and receiver, they are not truly infrared style ""wireless"" devices. The data actually transmits through your home's electrical wiring, which can be marginally effective to almost totally useless depending on your wiring. I tried using them to transmit dial up modem data, and found the system totally inadequate. Beware."
2,Didn't Work Well,"They may be good in theory, but they didn't work in practice. The idea is that the systems sends telephone signals over your home wiring. Unfortunately, that means it gets interference from everything in your house that's plugged in. Microwaves, TVs, lights, computers, clocks, vacuums, washing machines, stereos, you name it, it will kick up some interference. I found that the remote unit would have a barely audible signal on about half the plugs I tried, and it wouldn't work at all on the other half. So unless your electrical system has very few things plugged into it, I'd say pass on this item. Fortunately for me, the seller promptly gave me a refund."
2,"Pops, clicks and buzzing are the norm",All of these products suffer from the same problems with interference/noise on AC wiring. I was using a Ethernet-over-Power Line product at the same time and that made the phone extender practically unusable. I ended up using WiFi bridge for the Ethernet solution but the phone extender quality is mediocre at best.
3,Good idea,"Works inconsistently and we had some trouble installing it to get it to perform. Finally, though, it connected properly. Still has a little glitch (phone chirping) but we put up with it."
3,"68 pieces? Uh, ok. That includes 50 individual cupcake wrappers...","Really, counting each cupcake paper as an item?! It's true I suppose, but seems somehow misleading or dishonest to advertise this package this way. Why not say instead 1 pkg of 50 count cupcake wrappers? Shady."
4,Live from Desolation Row,"An amazing piece of recorded history. Willie &#65533; well past his last nickel &#65533; goes for broke on these recorded demos in hopes to peddle his wares to Patsy Cline and the like. The hunger and desperation are palpable in failed-relationship-as-apocalypse classics such as &#65533;I&#65533;ve Just Destroyed the World&#65533; and &#65533;Darkness on the Face of the Earth.&#65533; But you can also hear the artistry of a man who studied Frank Sinatra for timing and could coin a country phrase with the best of &#65533;em. Still, this stuff is so haunted that it&#65533;s a wonder anyone heard the hit potential behind all the pain. For those who think Johnny Cash&#65533;s recent cover of Nine Inch Nails is as low as ay man ought to sink, try &#65533;Opportunity to Cry&#65533; or &#65533;Permanently Lonely,&#65533; the best broken heart revenge song ever written."
4,For anyone who's ever wondered . . .,". . . about Willie's reputation as a songwriter, check this out. In addition to the title song, ""Opportunity to Cry,"" ""Permanently Lonely,"" ""Darkness on the Face of the Earth,"" and ""Half a Man (hidden track)"" are all magnificently written. And I know that you can get all of those songs in other versions on other Willie CDs, but here, you get them stripped down, sometimes with no accompaniment but Willie's guitar. The result is that you are forced to focus on the songs, and you begin to see what makes them truly great. In other words, it doesn't take Patsy Cline's beautiful voice surrounded by Owen Bradley's production values to see (or hear) that ""Crazy"" is a great, great song.This is an important discovery of the early stages of one of America's greatest songwriters."
4,Nextimeland,This record is a good record. It has jangles and melodies and holds together well. Robyn puts some holds on his lyrical obscurities to make it a little more graspable(sic) to the common head. This does not feel like a Soft Boys adventure however and that is because the SB were about MANIC crazed guitars and bad trips.This is a Robyn Hitchcock record played by the SB guys.It seems somehow wrong to call this SB cause that changes what the SB represent.Nice solo Hitch record tho.Recommended.Just don't expect anywhere near the energy that we had with the Softies. These guys are in thier 50's so it cannot be expected that they would play with such fever as they did.It's like a reunion that sounds like Hitchcock more than SB.
3,"Great to have them back, but...","...I must confess to being somewhat dissapointed, not only by this album but by their recent concert appearance (Mercury Lounge, NYC). What I admired in their early material was their manic frantic energy, and it's sorely missing here. The uptempo numbers could be much more up tempo - if they had been recorded in the Underwater Moonlight days, they surely would have been. One gets the sense of a wind-up doll that's in dire need of a winding up. (Their older songs suffered the same fate when I saw them live. PICK IT UP A LITTLE!)"
4,Maybe it'll rain tonight,"Some might be disapointed that the Soft Boys' first album in 20 years isn't Underwater Moonlight jr. But to my ears, Nextdoorland is actually superior in some respects. For one thing, the band is playing better than ever. (Several tracks feature some terrific extended dual guitar interplay between Robyn Hitchcock and Kimberly Rew that's a bit reminiscent of Television, oddly enough.) There's real verve and energy in the sound and performances, and the songwriting is consistently engaging, featuring structures that never go where you think they will (a chorus comes in where you'd expect another verse, parts flow into parts without coming to a conventional chorus, songs that end in abrupt, unexpected eays, etc.). All in all, a triumphant return for Hitchcock and company."
5,Humanist Film-making,"How can movies be this good? Well when you combine the work of a Zen-Humanist who has seen war as well as peace combined with the best restorationist DVD company in the States, well you get these sad, wise, funny films from Ozu in his Late Master phase.Pour a bottle of Sake for yourself and/or a good friend and watch as the this wise sad genius helps us all to understand that life is, well just that; life.oh sweet nothing, ain't but nothing at all, as The Velvet Underground says. :)"
3,"""If they can do it, duckie, so can I...""","Mouth-watering shots about Beijing's most popular dish, but alas, no recipes for us aficionados trying to recreate it in the bareness of our western kitchens. No list of ingredients, no cooking techniques, no culinary tips, nothing. Just an hour long travelogue with several interviews with Chinese chefs about how hard it is to run a business nowadays.Oh, and several scenes where you see the hapless birds being maltreated before having their throats slit, the producer could very well have left in the editing floor. Maybe I was expecting something else, but they could have thrown in some useful information instead."
5,Great Little Fan,"This little fan packs a strong wind when you need it, but also has infinitely variable speeds to produce a light breeze."
1,This fan blows nothing but hot air,"Hi:It is 84 degrees and hot so my roommate and I went shopping for a good fan. The Vornado got praises so I bought one for my small bedroom.WELL, it doesn't COOL anything. And I mean nothing. It is still so hot that I had to put two other fans in my room.I don't know what you guys are talking about - about this fan being great - this fan is functionally horrible.It's aesthetically pleasant, sturdy, easy to put together, and looks like it is durable, however, I believe I must take this back. Three fans and STILL hot?The Vornado is just not worth the cash.For now, I am simply sweating in New York City."
3,Does not cool sufficiently,"This is a very small fan. If you are looking for a fan that will truly cool you in a hot room, this is not the fan for you. You will need something bigger. I live in an upper floor apartment of an old building, with only one window unit air conditioner in my dining room and this little fan that I move around the apartment as necessary, and it really doesn't cool at all when the outside temperature rises above 80 degrees. It seems to do a pretty good job of circulating the air (though it doesn't oscillate), but it will not cool hot air. I was also hoping it would be noisier than it is; I like a lot of white noise to block out distracting noises around me. Even on the most powerful setting it's not all that loud."
1,Vornado 550B - defective right out of the box,"Despite checking and rechecking, the fan blade catches against the inside of the housing, within seconds you get that wonderful electrical-motor-burning-out smell. This was the first Vornado product I ordered, needless to say, it is the also the LAST. I will make sure to tell everyone I know not to buy Vornado products."
2,Not Really Very Quiet,"Even though this has a variable fan speed so that the fan can run at a whisper quiet speed, it has a motor that is loud and operates at a very annoying frequency. In addition, the fan is high priced. I returned it."
1,Lasted 1 Year,"Pros:1) Light enough to move around.2) Variable speed dial.3) Sharp looking unit.4) Whisper quiet on low settingsCons:1) Motor died within a year.2) Small fans have to spin more times to move the same air as a large fan, therefore this fan is very loud at higher speeds.3) The Price. A fan that cost this much money should last more than a year when it is used under regular circumstances.Avoid."
1,Too many errors and omissions. Save your $$,"I am a Los Angeles native who has lived on the Eastside (San Gabriel Valley) and on the Westside of our grand city. I was very excited to find a neighborhood by neighborhood guide. Unfortunately the beautifully slick graphics seduced me.This ""guide"" (quotation marks because it falls so short of what it claims itself to be) was an inadequate effort by mostly New Yorkers. So a few of those New Yorkers transplanted themselves to LA. Many of these writers, editors frankly do NOT get LA.I found multiple errors and omissions which are NOT minor. e.g., restaurant row on La Cienega in Beverly Hills was omitted. Hospitals which have closed long ago are listed. In the essentials section, where are the grocery stores or supermarket lists?!?! Wouldn't grocery stores take priority over gas stations?Don't count on this for your life!"
5,"Funny, tragic, wry, true","Herndon brings us along through the mystification of his first year as a public school teacher. In the end, he is fired for, well, for teaching. This series of stories -- told matter of factly and leaving much up to the interpretation of the reader -- still rings true, as he captures the inherent paradoxes teachers and students face every day."
4,Handy book for attracting birds into your garden,"This is a very handy book, identifying popular & common garden birds, gives ways of supplementing feeding & care & additional touches to attract birds like simple birdhouses you can build. It also gives you plants to have in your garden to attract the widest selection of birds. Special features include hummingbirds, unwanted bird guests, occasional garden visitors, constructing a feeding table, a list of prime favourite plants, keeping part of your fruit crop, plants for desert dwellers only & annuals, perennials & other plants."
3,Don't Expect Miracles,"I also bought this item to deal with my cat's litter box. I think it helps a little, but don't expect miracles. I tried the boost function right after my cat did her business and did not notice any difference."
5,A beautiful book with great pictures and the author's good example,"This book has great photos, covers front yards in all types of North American ecosystems, and also includes the author's recounting of how she came to change her own front yard after being inspired by the front yards she saw on a trip to Europe. I have a small front yard, but appreciate the inspiration of these photos, which show many good ideas and plants and flowers. This book is one of my favorites."
2,"Great photos, okay reference","I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this is more of a photo book than a reference or how-to book. There are some great ideas, but if it was merely going to be a photo book of ideas then they should have included more photos."
3,Not good for bumpers,"This is probably fine for normal weights, but my bumper plates don't really fit on here; the pegs are too close together."
4,Excellent stand. Looks great.,"Just what I expected. Good solid stand, looks great in my home gym and keeps my plates safely organized."
4,Nice.,"The only thing that kept this from getting a 5 star was that one of the holes for the middle branch was out of alignment; I had to drill a new one to get the bolt to go in. Having said that, this is a nice handy storage system for your Olympic weights that you don't want to trip over, it is relatively lightweight and easily moved (empty!)"
1,Too wordy,You'd better have a thesaurus handy when you read this one. I didn't like it. I like authors who say what they mean in plain language.
5,The Politics of Jesus,"This book may not be an easy read for the average reader, but it is loaded with great material and sound scholarship, which makes his arguments and positions very strong and convincing. I would recommend this book for anyone who has a sense of social justice and hates to see religion being described as opium for the people, because Jesus' position is very revolucionary. Fr. Don Kirchner, CSSR"
5,Worth revisiting.,"I read this last year, eschewing many newer political life of Jesus books as I prefer being taught by a ""Christian"" scholar who believes what Jesus said. I found new and potent ways of looking at Jesus' actions and gleaning more from His examples. I have just finished Obery Hendricks' book of the same title which was well worth reading and fits well with Yoder's but suffers, I think, from over simplification in order to appeal to what is being called the ""emerging"" Christian paradigm. I do not find that in Yoders work and I think it will maintain its place of importance as a resource."
5,Toward a Christ-Centered Ethic; The Politics of Jesus,"In The Politics of Jesus, John H. Yoder argues that mainline ethicists have falsely assumed that the Jesus in the gospels fails to present us with a normative social ethic. In his careful study of the gospel of Luke and other scriptures; Yoder shows us that Jesus not only showed us a social ethic, but also that Jesus' ethic was accepted as normative by the early church. In this book, Yoder touches on topics such as peace and justice, Government authority, Paul and subordination, as well as Revelation and an Eschatological theology. Yoder convincingly argues that the Power of God is given as gift, through cross and resurrection, and that the 'handles of history' are not controlled in a cause and effect relationship as is often assumed by so-called 'realist' theologies.Jesus, the slain Lamb, has conquered... him let us follow.A truly magnificient account of faithful theology."
3,Great themes - hard to get at,"I have heard a lot about John Howard Yoder, and let me just say, I am not impressed. It is obvious he is a brilliant scholar and writer, and has some great ideas and insights. But I found myself slogging through this book.He does a good job showing the connection of the teachings of Jesus to political themes of His day, and how followers of Jesus today will be living in ways that challenge the culture and customs of our time. These are all important themes and should be written about more.But for me, Yoder's writing style reminded me of eating a pomegranate. I love the juice and the flavor, but all the crunch and seeds make it hardly worth the effort."
4,Pest chaser,"This product evidently does what it claims to do. I have no pests in my house. I didn't have pests before I bought this product but I assume it keeps pests from entering. The only exception being the ""two legged upright type."" One of the things I like most about this product is it is quiet and unobtrusive."
3,bringing back memories,This doll brings back some of better memories I have as a child. I had the Holly Hobbie doll. One of my sisters had Ragedy Ann. I still have my doll and would like to find one very similar to the original and pass it on.
3,Mold?,"I cant say if it is the actual filter or the humidifier itself but it seems like this filter builds up a lot of mold quickly. I have purchased 3 so that I can rotate them. Hopefully this will give the filter time to dry out before i put it back in. However, just a word to the wise... If you have to leave for over a week, make sure that you remove all parts that get wet otherwise the moldy smell will settle in the un cleanable parts and it takes a while to work itself out of the system. So my recommendation so far - buy more than one filter....."
3,Exhorbitant rise in price,Price rise from last year 6.99 to 15.00 this year. Disgraceful.Dr. Lucille F. Becker
2,short life-span,"Sure, it works just wonderfully when I first replace the filter, but it only lasts about 3 weeks, not 3 months. We use the humidifier all day and night in our very dry apartment which is only 500 square feet, and after even 1 week I start smelling the moldy smell. This is despite cleaning the tank and tray every 2 days (they recommend once a week) and turning the filter over every day. And you have to keep all the windows and doors closed, or it won't work at all. That makes for very stagnant air quality. Very disappointing."
1,Hamilton Beach Filter- WASTE OF MONEY!,"I can't believe that Amazon actually requested that I write a review for this item as THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST FILTERS and the actual TRUE AIR unit was a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. You are lucky to get 2 WEEKS out of each filter before it falls apart. The unit never gets up to the desired humidity (and all I ask for is 50%). The description says to change the water once a month- We have to refill the thing TWICE EACH DAY. We are currently looking for another unit (different manufacturer, of course)I suggest you also find another unit before you spend another dime on these filters!!!! also please note that a previous reviewer said she/he purchased 3 filters to alternate- THESE ARE DISPOSABLE AND ARE NOT MEANT TO BE DRIED OUT AND REUSED!... unless you are trying to kill yourself or someone you ""love"" with Legionaires Disease..."
3,"Works *okay,* I guess","It keeps the air *kinda* moist, but it never reaches the desired humidity level (I ask for 50%); even on the highest setting, I can only reach approx. 25-30%. My old apt. has a ""forced hot air"" heating system, so some humidity is crucial. I use the thing about 20 hours everyday. After 3 weeks of by-the-book care, the original filter just stopped absorbing water & became hard & crusty. Replacement filters can be a bit pricey, so I bought a 4-pack elsewhere."
4,Solutions to Cited Problems,"I run the humidifier 24/7 and am able to get good performance out of my Humidifier by doing the following:I use Holmes Genuine Replacement Humidifier Bacteriostat, 32 oz., # S1708PDQ-U (on Amazon) to keep the filter flexible and clean. 2 months, and have only used half the bottle.I run a fan across the humidifier sensor. This keeps the air in the room mixing and moving. Doing this, I can easily achieve any humidity desired (my 15x18 room is kept at 50 - 55%).I hope this helps you get the most out of this product.4 stars for price and the fact that the additional measures mentioned above are required for full performance."
2,Too Expensive,"All the bad reviews are right on. We may have to use this and put up the cash because i havnt found anything else, but the filters only last a short while if cared for perfectly. If not cared for perfectly you risk hurting your kids health."
2,Hamilton Beast change often,"If you can get 2 weeks out of each filter from about 12 to 15 hours per day of use you are doing good. The water absorbs into the filter so it does get moldy, but that's the nature of the design. I mainly used it in the hallway between two rooms with the doors of the rooms open, and the humidity reading would always stay around 25% even when on high and I set it to go to 45%, but it could never get there. The humidifier that this filter fits into is just not that powerful unfortunately. The filters are what they are, it is the humidifier itself that can only handle small to medium sized rooms. The high setting on the Hamilton Beach unit is very loud. I recently lost this unit in a house fire and I wouldn't buy it again. I'd go for either a filterless system or a unit that can handle larger rooms even if they cost more."
5,best self tanner ever,I have used more self tanners that I can count. This is by far the best. It is just the right shade so it doesn't leave obvious streaking while providing a very natural shade for me. love it!
4,Simpatico,"D.A.D. has always been a band that is about quirky lyrics wrapped around simple melodies and straight ahead rock; the type of music sadly bereft from modern radio.They don't disappoint with ""Simpatico."" With lyrics like ""I burn the midnight oil, pour it on my salad,"" (Home Alone 4) and ""Everytime that you throw dirt you lose a little ground"" (Now or Forever) their spin on American colloquilisms is as strong as ever.D.A.D. makes music to have fun, but the somber ""Hand Without Strength"" shows a rarely seen side, and a glimpse of why this band should be as large as Aerosmith or the like.Barring the disharmony of the title track, this is a complete album and something old D.A.D.fans will enjoy, and also a great introduction for those new to this heavily underrated band."
4,A great album,I really love this album because of it's mix with heavy and really stripped ballads with lot of passion. This album really grows for every listening and becomes one of my favorites.D-A-D is always D-A-D. They should be biggest in a perfect world.
1,Don't waste your money on this,"After reading all the glowing reviews about how good this product is, I decided to give it a try. My apartment had been teeming with roaches and I wanted to try a hassle-free way of ridding them. This product does NOT work. Short and simple. This device is supposed to repel roaches but I see roaches crawling all over it. I have tried all combinations of settings available on the device (high, low, continuous, variable, random, etc) but still no luck. Save yourself some frustrations (and money) by buying a can of bug spray or a box of roach motel!"
1,Attracts more roaches!!!!!,"We [bought] this product...It didn't repel any insects at all. Instead, we were constantly seeing roaches and roach droppings *around* the unit. It actually attracted them instead of repelling them!!! DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,Not satisfatory result,"I have found that PestContro 2000 does not help to keep the cockroaches away from my flat. It is not as ""powerful"" as I would have expected."
3,"not great, but not bad either","always had little flying insects or bugs in the apt, probably saw on average one a day. tried this product on a whim and i might have seen maybe one bug a month. sister-in-law has it now so i ended up getting another one (newer model, PestControII) recently cuz i'm getting sick of the bugs again. we'll see if it was just a fluke or if this thing works like the old model"
1,Didn't repel any bugs even after weeks of use.,"I had high hopes for this expensive device. Unfortunately, it didn't repel anything at all. Ants, spiders, centipedes, all were walking around this device in a small room. This was after continuous use of the device for at least 2 weeks (as recommended by the company) at the setting for small bugs.I hate to do this but I am going to buy the regular bug traps now."
2,Rosie,"I was so hoping this would work. Tried both fixed and variable settings but no deal. So, I ended up returning it."
4,A Great Master Near the End of His Life,"Oscar Pettiford is one of the great bassists in the history of Jazz. After leaving the United States for Europe in 1958, he made a number of recordings before his untimely death in a bycycle accident. His talents as a bassist and cellist are on display here with some pretty good Danish Jazz musicians. I am not familiar with any of them but they play quite well. There isn't much Oscar Pettiford around on disc these days and I recommend this fine post bop effort as a part of any serious Jazz collection."
2,Rip-off DVD,"My kids and I love Dora, and as soon as a new Dora DVD comes out I purchase it. I was extremely upset to learn that this DVD is just a bunch of old episodes recycled in different packaging. The first episode, ""Pinto, the Pony Express"" is the only episode we don't already have on DVD. The other three Dora episodes are already on other DVDs. ""A letter for Swiper"" also appears in the ""Big Sister Dora DVD."" ""Choo Choo"" also appears on the ""We're a Team!"" DVD. And ""Hic-Boom-Ohhh!"" also appears on the ""Animal Adventures"" DVD."
5,my daughter loves this!,"This is my favorite Dora adventure so far! My 22 month old daughter loves Pinto the Pony! This dvd is her favorite, too. She loves that all the characters are in this one also. There are also 3 extra episodes on this one.This is a must have!"
1,Must Be Defective!,Followed directions. Remained warm about 6 minutes. Could not reuse or get them to reheat. Maybe mine were defective. Not returnable now. Had to trash them. Wasted money!
3,good for those who want to read abotu the navajo,"I only purchased this because it was required reading in a class I took. The Indian life interests me, but not enough to read several books about it. However, this does have some good information in it for anyone who wants to study the navajo and their history."
4,"Good, easy read","This is an easy, engaging read. But, it doesn't cover the last few decades of history, which are really very interesting. Definitely a nice introduction to the Navajo history."
2,Is This Really How the Navajos Did Things?,"I'm sorry folks, but I thought it was boring. I know I fell asleep in the beginning of the afternoon one day while I was reading it. Sure, the facts about the Navajo that the author researched, were researched very well. And I had a sense that the Author was going to let me in on just how much he researched, even if most of what he had to say was very subtle. I can take subtle from an author for just a short time, and then I go and look for a good Romance."
5,It's magical,"This is the best music I have ever been introduced to. I have never heard it played in the U.S, only in Europe. I am just so disappointed that there is not another album out by ERA. The music is uplifting, soothing, anything you want it to be, depending on your current mood. It is, and will be, my all-time favorite. If you know where to find ERA, tell them to get busy on another album! :-)"
5,A Style long Forgotten,"This was a new and diffrent CD for me but after I heard a sample of Ameno on Amazon.com I needed to get it. Its a style I have never heard before. It brings Medival European gothic music together with 21st century music. Its Very Soothing and I suggest you but it, you wont regret it."
5,A brilliant mixture of peace and fantasy,"The CD is one if the most beautiful that I have heard yet. Even though it is sung in a fantasy language, it reminds you somehow of a holy event where some amazing brightness appears. From the very first note that is played, peace is spread around the room. A first class mix of modern and spiritual music, the peaceful singing and atmosphare on one side and the shear beauty of the electric guitarre on the other. I would recommend it as a must."
5,"Eric Levi, composer & producer of ERA is passionate & true",French composer Eric Levi's passion & soul has shown through in his top selling CD ERA. He loves his work and is currently working on ERA II.
3,Not very original,"Though this album has a couple of interesting and entertaining tracks (""Ameno"" and ""Mother""), it is too unoriginal to deserve 5 or even 4 stars. All the trademark elements that are present in this style of music, from the sensual female voices to the chants with electronic beats in the background, have been tried before with better taste by Enigma, Delerium, etc. And where did that awful guitar solo in one of the songs come from? Enigma's first album is far better than this one and Delerium's _Karma_ is also great. My recommendation: buy Enigma's first two albums and then (if you haven't had enough of this kind of music yet) you could try this one."
5,Between Heaven and Earth,"Well, what's not to say about this album? It is somewhere between heaven and earth, between Enigma and Mythos, and yet neither. Era quite comfortably creates its own unique niche with this album. It has a European-Medieval flair while dancing on the fringes of New Age. At the same time, there is some excellent guitar riffs, much like the great rock ballads of the past. Tony MacAlpine immediately comes to mind. The synthesizers mixed with the Latin Choir is strongly reminiscient of Enigma, sounding parallel and yet diagonal.If you enjoy losing yourself in the rhythm and the emotional feel of music, then you will definitely enjoy this album. Just sit back, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and drift into the choirs that will lift you to heaven and then dive into the oceanic lull of the rhythm that will swiftly return you to earth.This music will definitely whisper to the ear of your heart. Where it will take you depends on the openness of your soul."
2,Like a Monk on speed,"There are some listenable parts to this amounting to about 3 minutes worth-I felt my toe tap at one point.Otherwise it's like a mixture of Enya, Spinal Tap and various other such.If you choose to close your eyes and picture a monk plugged in with electric guitar, eyes closed, sliding on his knees across the pulpit you may derive some benefit from this listening experience-though it will be from the funny (unintentionally) and not the musical side."
5,"A really ""must have"" CD","This is an amazing collection of standard pop songs deeply influenced by classical music and the new age atmosphere. Sometimes ethereal and sometimes strong, but without unnecessary noise. The interplay between chorus and guitar sounds new and refreshing creating a new path for eclectical spirits. Although there are parts that sound like Queen in ""Innuendo"" and others exactly like Enigma, the difference is in the intention. While Enigma es sensual and even bizarre, Eric Levy shows an epical intention and I think he get it fine. This music is ideal for traveling at night or to be standing in the top of a mountain. I strongly recommend to anyone who like personal projects like Enigma or Deep Forest."
3,Rushed to print,"I am an enormous Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest fan. This book is very good in its treatment of the civilizations and individual units but very weak in the campaign walkthroughs. Don't expect the walkthroughs to give you all that much of an advantage during gameplay. Also, I have counted at least 5 typos and I've only owned it a few weeks. They must have really rushed to get this to market.The unit descriptions are outstanding. Worth the price just for that."
5,It is everything you need in a strategy guide,"This book does a great job of telling you about each senario and the reason for specific senario changes. It doesn't give you so much that it spoils the game, but it is well worth it and almost essential for a game like this."
4,Nice,"In the book, Noam mostly talks about the US involvement in foreign affairs, and crushing the ""good influences,"" and some other topics that expand from what I read in ""Secrets, Lies, And Democracy,"" but not quite as informative. It's fairly understandable."
1,Another piece of work from the loony high priest of the left,"America is Nazi GermanyThe former Soviet Union was democraticAmerica is a totalitarian regimeThere was no Cold WarThere were no ""good guys"" during World War IIyeah rightdo I have to keep writing?"
2,I Still Prefer Her Preaching Ministry,"I'm glad that Jaunita is taking her ministry to another avenue, even though I must say I much rather hear her just simply bring the spoken word. Keep Blessing God's people."
3,Ummm....,"Jaunita is anointed no doubt, but I think most of these great songs were wasted on a mediocre voice."
1,OH MY GOD!!!!!!,"Please stick to preaching and prophesying! A singer she is not. Why does everyone feel that if the Lord bless them with one gift, now they have to write books and make cd's. Oh no...not this time. This is horrible. Her voice is absolutely meant for declaring the Good News but surely not singing ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Gospel reviews,"This is an awesome CD. She might not have the greatest voice in the world, but her voice in anointed and I would rather hear an anointed voice then someone who could sing every note on the piano. This and Donnie Mcclurkin Psalms, Hymns, Maurette Clark Brown, Micah Stampley just to name a few, will usher you into his very presence. They are not entertainment junk, they will bless your very life."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ONE,Juanita Bynum continues to be an inspiration. This is another magnificent CD. Looking forward to her next annointed CD.!!
4,Thank You !,"I really love this CD. The worship songs are so anoited. I can feel her love for the Lord in her songs. I must say I enjoy the slower worship songs more that the upbeat songs. I believe her gift is in slower worship songs. Which I think is great, because we have so many gospel artist who sing the more upbeat contempary songs. It's a real blessing to enjoy Minister Bynum style. I am a praise dance team coach. I just choreograph a dance to ""above all else"". thank you so much for using all your gifts for the Glory of God."
5,If you are a Worshiper then you will enjoy this CD especially Disk 2,"I must be honest when I first purchased this CD it was on the go and I did not like it. But when I was still and I really listen to the CD during my time of prayer I fell in love with the worship especially with the music from the second CD. I mean when you think about when you give God back what He has blessed you with or when you minister to someone and you just give Him His glory back it is awesome. Any Crown and You Are are covers of Hillsong the worship group from Australia. Prophetess Bynum just allows God to minister to the listeners. I can feel the anointing through her worship which pulls me into that secret place with God. Words Can not really describe how I feel about this CD. If this is a CD for you I can not say; however, I would encourage you to seek God and ask for His direction in your life. Because I do not recommend this CD as entertainment, I recommend this CD as ministry."
1,Awful! Worst kids movie of ALL TIME,"This was so annoying, I got chills up my spine watching it. My kids didnt even like it. They BEGGED me to leave the theater. I made them stay, even bribed them with candy and popcorn, they are always well-behaved, but this time, they were YELLING at the screen, and even wanted me to get my money back for the tickets!The worst part of it was that overrated ""comedian"" that did the voice of the dog, that george lopez guy. I wont even begin to tell you about all the hidden adult themes in it!It is in your best interest to destroy this disc."
1,Horrible!,"One of the worst childrens' movies I have seen.My three-year-old daughter and I went to the theater to watch it because at the time, there was not other kid movie out and we ended up leaving early because neither of us found the movie at all entertaining. The 45 minutes we where there seemed like hours--I was in agony.The jokes are old and overdone and rely on really obvious sterotypes that weren't ever funny. ""Hold your tacos!"" It's predictable.My daughter, who loves Wall-E and Kung Fu Panda, even Once, did not like this at all...it was hell to sit through. Hell!"
1,A rare miss for Disney,"I am unsure how this sin against god even got past the idea stage. If not for the movie Bolt, I think Disney would have taken a nose dive. Not only do they use one of the ugliest dog breeds. The story is something that one would make up after an all nighter and then realize that a paper is due in an hour. If you are going to get your kids a movie that they will enjoy and you will enjoy multiple times just save yourself a headache and get Bolt. I can promise you after the first time you'll want to throw this disc out and wish you could get your money and that hour of your life back."
1,"Disappointing, not good for kids",We purchased this movie as our son loves talking dog movies. He found it boring. I thought the theme of dogfighting was not fit for a children's movie. Disappointing.
5,Great gift for a friend,I watch the movie and it was cute. But this gift is for a friend of mine. Since she gave me a gift for me and my family.
5,Beverly Hills Chihuahua DVD,This DVD was a gift for a friend who loves dogs. The DVD came in a timely manner. The movie was intertaning so she loved it.
4,Chihuahua's,"If I didn't own a Chihuahua, I might not like this movie much. But I love my little dog and it was fun watching all of these wonderful little dogs perform in this movie."
3,Fine For Kids,"But a little thin for adults, leaning heavily on predictable gags, dilemmas, and character quirks. It's a sharp stick in the eye to rich snotty women and the unpolished or corrupt lifestyles of some Mexicans. Drew Barrymore does the best she can to pull off the bland stereotypes and absurd coincidences. Don't expect much and you may be amused."
3,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,Rented thd movie after adopting a Chihuahua from pound. Better than expected. Some funny scenes. It was worth the price of a rental. May even rent the next 2.
1,NO ENGLISH closed captions for the hearing impaired,"Mr. Iger of Walt Disney World Company.There are many movies we would liked to have seen but, they do not have ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the menu set up. Why is it that a movie being distributed in the United States of America has spanish or some other language for subtitles in the menu set up? The PRIMARY language in America is ENGLISH. As we are hearing impaired and must have ENGLISH closed captions in the menu set up. I guess we will miss a lot of the movies produced by your companies.Without ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the movie menu set up, we will not be able to purchase particular movies of interest. You lost another sale on this one and I am sure as well as others in the future."
3,Had to send back,I did not notice when ordering this product that it was Blu-ray. I contacted the seller and since I hadn't opened it allowed me to send I back. I could not watch this as I do not own a Blu-ray player.
1,WAY BELOW ADVERTISED CONDITION EXTREMELY EMARASSED TO GIVE IT AS A PRESENT. I WAS HUMILIATED. NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.,"Absolutely the most embarising condition. I had to give this as a present and I was ashamed. NEVER EVER WOULD I BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!! I wish I would have taken a picture of it. It was horrible. I have purchased so much from your site and promoted you, but this was NOT to standards!!!!!"
1,The worst,"Beverly Hills ChihuahuaThis is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. Although I am a Jamie Lee Curtis fan, I would not recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 5."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","This movie is neither ""hilarious"" nor ""fun filled"". Much of it is very disturbing, with violence towards animals both portrayed and implied including dogfighting. The only jokes there are rely on some pretty offensive stereotypes and Piper Perabo's peculiar appearance is very off-putting.And don't even get me started on the endless self-aggrandizing ads that precede the film.You'd be much better off with Lady & the Tramp or the Ugly Dachshund. Avoid this like the plague."
2,I Need a Life,"I must have no life thinking I would be entertained by dogs being coaxed, prodded and fed off screen to run, sit or perform some unnatural pose long enough for a camera to capture the event. Then add lots of editing & splicing to make something that makes a little continuity/plot sense. Finally add some really dumb human clothes to the poor critters and lots of CG doggy mouth movements and I'm realizing it's time to call my therapist. On a positive note: the rat and iguana were really well done (must have been created by a different studio)."
4,Great Movie for kids,"I purchased this in Blu-ray for me as well as my kids, I had to see just how good the video was, and I was not disappointed."
3,"Like they say... ""it's the best Chihuahua movie you'll see all year""","My wife got this for our grand-daughter.. And all the way through she keps saying ""Pookie is going to love this"" I'll have to get with the apple of my heart and ask what she really thought.I thought it wasn't the worst thing I watched lately, but in 2008 there were some great movies, and this wasn't one of them.So here's the deal, if you like talking dog movies and aren't easily offended by racial stereo-types then you might love this, otherwise give it to your young ones to watch while your still at work.But that's just me.2 1/2 *Update...As for my Grandaughter... she says 4* so there you go."
3,The Chihuahua Sequel,"As a fan of the first Beverly Hills Chihuahua movie, I was a little disappointed in the sequel. It was the casting, the original cast was far superior and I tried but couldn't get over it. I have watched the original several times but I don't think I will watch the sequel again."
3,Not as funny as the ad's make out,The movie is only mildly funny. Humor is to far between the laughs. Expected something much more creative and humorous than this.
5,dog gone pleased,"we are very pleased with this dvd, was received in excellent condition with on time delivery"
3,Beverly Hills Chihuahua dvd,I wasn't too crazy about the storyline... wasn't what i expected it to be. The dogs are all very cute in the movie tho; and how they make the dogs look like they're talking is incredible. But i have to give it 3 stars due to the storyline.
3,Entertaining and happy,"This is a fun, entertaining and happy film for kids and adults who don't want a ""Marley and Me"" ending."
5,happy,im so happy about my producted i ordered it about a wk ago and got it a day after it shipped and it was supposed to take 14 days.. i love this company i always get my stuff early and its always as described..used but perfect like new thank u from me and my kids...:)
4,good item,It took a little longer to get than I thought buy guess that is how things go. It came in a foam envelope so think that it should have been here sooner but happy with the result
5,Fascinating and inspiring,I never thought a documentary about architecture could be so fascinating. Sydney Pollack does an excellent job of delving into Frank Gehry's techniques and the controversy over his buildings. More interesting than you might imagine.
5,Frank Gehry rocks!,"Frank Gehry is one of the most dynamically creative, risk-taking artist of our time.Sydney Pollack sketches his life in a way that does them both justice."
3,Gehry Sketches,"With all respect to talented --and unfortunately, late-- Sydney Pollack, I did not find this documentary satisfactory. First and foremost, it lacked focus. The conversations were recorded haphazardly, as if it was a very casual Sunday-morning chat. The subject of ""Architectural Design"" and a famous architect's approach to his concepts deserve a more serious effort and more structured (no pun intended) presentation."
3,I know one when I see one,"Outside of Ayn Rands, The Fountainhead, I knew nothing of architecture. After watching, Sketches of Frank Gehry, by Sydney Pollack, I still know nothing of architecture; save identifying a Gehry building when I see one. I bought the movie because I'm a Sidney Pollack fan; unfortunately, I was duped because I thought the movie was a bit narcissistic. This was not the typical Pollack depth and/or quality."
2,A letdown,"It is very hard for me to like this film after seeing My Architect. Pollock is in love with Gehry's work, which is fine, but it does not a good documentary make. In fact, I'm troubled that the only Gehry detractor in the film is a bald and effeminate architecture critic unable to articulate that as outrageous and weird Gehery's buildings are, many thoughtful people find them merely silly. Some years after Gehry's death maybe, just maybe, will his estranged son create a more robust documentary."
1,It broke before we even got the charge on our credit card.,The strap on this diving mask broke the second time it was used. It appears to have had a very weak spot that was stretched out. I was very disappointed since this was a gift for my granddaughter.
5,Best New Show of the Season!!!,"My wife and I have been watching this show from day one and love it! The cast is great, the story lines are hilarious and we can't wait for Season 2 to begin. Its one of the best comedies/shows on TV. If you like Modern Family, Friends (yes I know dated...) and are looking for a great comedy, try this out. We want to get the upcoming season expanded to a full 22 episodes and keep it going! Everyone tune in...Wednesday nights!"
1,Smallville,This is not an item ordered by me!? I hope I wasn't charged for this item.What is it a book or what?
3,50/50,"Was introduced to this show by a friend, and thought that it was humorous overall. Found that the episodes seem to be either hit or miss. Read the previous reviews comparing the show to Friends, but think it more closely resembles How I Met Your Mother. Didn't realize that Damon Wayans son stars in the show until I was reading the credits or no now I remember was looking at the cast list on the back of the dvd case. Should have figured it out sooner when Damon Wayans actually plays Damon Wayans Jr. father. That episode was definitely hilarious. Even more so later when I realized they were related; can kind of see the resemblance. Did anyone else realize Damon Wayans was that old? Alright I'm getting off track, overall thought the show was funny."
2,Penny,"The pilot episode was very good, but the rest just went down hill for me, the character Penny is nerve racking, all I can see is her lips over pronounicating and they just take over everything and plus she is silly, I love tv comedies, I own so many seasons of tv shows, Friends, Will & Grace, Rules of Engagement, Til Death and many more. I find this one to be very silly, I loved the pilot, I'd been watching clip online on ABC until it premeired, Penny is my least favorite"
2,Not quite all the originals,"I bought this CD mainly because I was looking for the original hit version of Jimmy Dean's 'Big bad John'. Well it's not there. On the original version which I taped more than 20 years ago from a Jim Pewter show the last line goes ""On the bottom of this mine lies A BIG, BIG MAN, Big John"", but on this CD Jimmy sings ""On the bottom of this mine lies ONE HELL OF A MAN, Big John"". It's close, but NOT the original take. Don't be fooled, check your old records and tapes."
1,Almost gets off the ground.,I guess I'm not into rock operas. Kept thinking it might get off the ground but alas it never did...
5,Mind Altering,"I first heard Holdsworth in the mid-80's. After a few hours of listening to the tapes I had, my impression was he was technically very good, but too far out there for my taste.I went to see Allan last night at a drum clinic in Milwaukee and was blown away. The best way I can describe the experience was that it was mind altering. Now in his 50's, he looked and sounded like the OB1-Kinobi of lead/improv. Cheers as well to his band mates Chad Wackerman on drums and Jimmy Johnson on bass, equally impressive.Anyway, I picked up this CD at the clinic and listened to it last night while falling a sleep. It is amazing. If you are a guitar, jazz, experimental, or true music fan, you need to try this CD. It is still way out there, but from the reviews I read here, it looks like this CD is as normal as he gets."
3,It's o.k.,"Allan revisits some classics of his from a different perspective. Maybe I just need to give it more time. I'm just not used to it, yet. It's interesting hearing a stand-up bass on a Holdsworth album, but I guess I just want to hear Allan, Jimmy, and Chad over and over again."
3,Too much Lizst and not enough Mozart,"Franz Liszt was an incredible pianist, but not a great composer. Wolfgang Mozart was not a great pianist, but a great composer. Allan Holdsworth has created an album which shows off his incredible single note runs, but none of his beautiful melodic development.From the beginning we are presented with weak dissonant chord melodies, each track sounding the same, running from one into the other. The few bright moments are overwhelmed by too many notes from Allan's synthaxe.To his credit, Allan plays fluid, clean, legato lines on the last two tracks. Sounding like a keyboard, the notes flow effortlessly. The problem is, they begin to sound like exercises and begin to detract from the music.Allan has spent a long time developing his mind. Now he needs to develop his heart."
1,Not Allan's finest work.,"Nothing but improvisation from start to finish. The songs are practically indistinguishable from each other and there are no melodies for the listener to cling to, just noodling around. I've listened to this album over and over and only song # 7 (Downside Up) has some melodic structure that stays in my mind after listening, but even that can wear out very quickly. Save your money and get two of Allan's finest works instead: Secrets and Wardenclyffe Tower."
5,Holdsworth takes it a step further.....,"Just when you thought Allan Holdsworth had run out of steam..... he produces this, his best work to date, and well worth the 4 year wait. Not only does he extend his solo and chordal playing to the next level, but his composition has matured also. Allan is joined by the talents of Dave Carpenter on bass and Gary Novak on drums, plus guest spots by Chad Wackerman and Walt Fouler. Just listen to 0274, Texas and the title track Sixteen men of tain.....you'll be amazed. Since buying this album, I haven't been able to listen to anything else."
5,MUST HAVE DVD FOR ALL DRUMMERS,unless your a protege who has been taught the correct way to hold and handle your sticks since age 2...... you need to really take time with this dvd!!!!!! there is only 1 bad review for this dvd by some idiot who probably did each exercise twice and moved on and i bet to this day his drumming still sounds sloppy!!!!!!!if you are unhappy with the way your hands sound or feel BUY THIS DVD!!!!!
5,Great instructional DVD for all levels including professional,Get this for my 21/2 year-old boy and this will last him for a life time.
2,Tommy Ego,"While finding your fulcrum, rebound strokes and accents are useful, this is a DVD for advanced students or students who have a teacher. Is it really necessary to go to 200 on metronome when group is playing? He does this to show that at higher speed technique doesnt change, but the beginning student is too easily alienated. Got tired of him saying, ""this is easy>"" Of course it is for him as he grew up with drums, not for beginners though."
3,They broke after a year,Eh im not mad they were cheap but they come apart easily and Only one side works. But unless theres something cheaper its not bad at all.
3,Great sounding but very uncomfortable,"I love the way it sounds, its lightweight and stays put, but, big but, it hurts my ear canal. I have to take them off because they torture my left ear. I end up wearing the left side half way off so that I can still listen but it won't pinch my ear."
2,"Huge, and Painful","I have normal sized ears, and I've used a lot of sport headphones in my time. These however, seem far to large to fit inside the ear, and the clip that holds them in place becomes irritating after a while. For summer runs, I use the Nike sport headphones when I can afford them (they break about every two or three months, but work well in the mean while), and for winter, I have just been using basic Colby headphones under a headband. These just don't cut the margin for me."
2,A big disappointment,"As a Dan Bern fan, I was eager to purchase this CD and ordered it as soon as it came out. I must day, it was not at all what I expected. These songs sound like Elvis Costello's throwaway tracks. The lyrics are flat and poppy (none of the philosophical zingers he's known for) and the arrangments are uninspiring and, at times, manic and nonsensical. Even the lovely ""I Need You"" loses its charm from overproduction (the acoutstic version I have is MUCH better). I don't know where these 5 star ratings are coming from. They must have heard a different CD than I heard. Coming after the PERFECT ""New American Language"" this was simply a big disappointment."
5,A Desert-Island Disc!,"This is one of my all-time favorite albums, perfect from start to finish....well, at least up until the last song ""You Need Feet""....haha! But the extra bonus tracks are also fantastic. This is one of those late '60s albums that deserves a place right up there with ""Pet Sounds"", ""Odessey and Oracle"", and other classic albums of baroque-pop of the late '60s. What a great time for pop music, and this album is a must-have."
4,"One More Bud, Please.","Bud has an incomparable sound: amber warm, a masterful vibrato, with a bit of sand from the breezy shore to give it the proper grit. His phrases have a swinging, exuberant lilt - a leftover from the dance years of early jazz. Bud's sound actually seemed to improve with age. It starts to get fuller by the '50s and never looks back. Sadly, ""Something to Remember You By"" is one of the few recordings currently available from this later period. Bud is ably accompanied by Dave Frishberg - here heard sans vocals and lyric wit. One only wishes their were more tunes and more blowing from Bud. If you get hold of any his cd's from the 50's or 60's hold them close."
3,smells like soggy house,"nothing wrong with it if you like the smell of the rain forest but i simply don't find this smell attractive - it makes my house smell like rain forest - soggy, old, fermented wood sort of smell... not a big fan, especially since smell is not strong enough to distinguish if this is fragrance or if i need to check my house if i have mold behind my walls... i think moldy smell might be the right way to describe this rain forest very ""natural leafy"" smell."
3,Smells great in the bottle but....,"I was looking forward to being able to add a scent to my humidifier so I bought 3 different scents. The scents smell wonderful in the bottles, but when I added it to the humidifier and turned it on I smelled nothing. I added more thinking that I didn't add enough and still no smell. I have added far more than recommended on the bottle and it just does not leave a scent once added to the humidifier. I was very disappointed. Now I have 3 bottles that smell great until you add it to a humidifier and then you get nothing."
1,"Save your money, this does not work","Simply doesn't work. I tried using more than the recommended amount in my humidifier and still, no results. You're better off going with just about any plug in air freshener."
2,"don't know much bout geography, don't know much bout poetry","The poems in Road Atlas certainly brings to mind what Walt Whitman said about bad poems: ""they drop horribly to the bottom of the pail."""
1,Simply Boring,"Why would someone write about boring places he or she visits? This book does not speak about the ordinary in any extraordinary fashion. The poems sag in the middle, wallow in cutesy voices, and do not reach any sort of epiphany. Who gave him his ""poetic license""? It should have been revoked a long time ago."
4,Small and strong,"This is a great little fan for my office space. I like that this is small, doesn't take up much desk space, and really moves a lot of air. Good fan for the money."
5,i'm pleased,"although pricey, this product is well worth the investment. it is a little big for a desk top model for use in a cubicle, as i use it but if you need moving air on you all the time like i do, it is an excellent choice. it is excellent quality and will take some abuse. i've left mine on overnight at the office and the motor has yet to burst into flames. my fan runs all the time when i'm at work as i need moving air to keep me from becoming ill. all in all, excellent buy."
3,"Expensive, but perhaps worth the price","I was very hesitant to shell out sixty bucks for a small table fan, but after going through five traditional fans of varying sizes and prices, and having to return all of them because they were either too loud or too flimsy (or both), I caved in and bought this Vornado.The amount of air this fan is capable of moving is impressive considering its size. It isn't quite as powerful as the Vornado lookalike (made by Honeywell) that I bought and then returned, but it's definitely a lot quieter. It's also smaller and can be taken apart for cleaning -- something I can't say about the lookalike.The fact that this fan is made in the USA and has a lifetime warranty are certainly good selling points. Still, I just wish it wasn't so expensive."
5,Works As Advertised,"I bought this fan recently during the prolonged heat wave this summer in the Western US. Although the fan arrived too late to help me during the heat wave, I've found that it works just as advertised and I agree with the positive reviews it's received. It is more expensive than the average fan you can pick up at the hardware store, I think it's worth the price. It's proved to be very effective in dropping the temperature several degrees in my upstairs bedroom by drawing in cool night air and circulating it throughout the room. This is a purchase I'm glad I made!"
4,Great fan....,"It is a great fan... I would have given it 5 stars except my fan is not as quiet as [I thought it would be]. The motor was making a strange noise to start. It goes away if I compress the plastic casing. IT is quiet and I believe a VERY good fan. I can't help think however, that I could buy 3+ box fans for the price of this one. I believe I will be happy with the decision to purchase the Vornado. Once the heat of summer comes I will better be able to rate."
2,Hyped Fan,"I bought this fan for a friend. They were previously on sale at Cosco @ 2 for $39. She was disappointed, as she said it wasn't very powerful. It does move air around but that's about it. This fan is OVERPRICED!!"
4,Keeps me cool,"Its pricy yes, but it keeps me cool whenever I need to be cool. And I am not a small guy either. It will keep you cool, its quiet, and doesn't get overheated (if you touch a box fan in the back you will burn your hand...if you don't believe me...try it). I used it in college and now I am using it at home and it provided great circulation in both places. How versatile! Great fan but didn't give it a five because of the price but if you don't mind the price, a must buy!"
3,It's so-so,"After reading most of the rave reviews here, I think I don't belong to this crowd. My Patton industrial heavy air circulator finally conked out after years of faithful service. I decided to replace it with this, buying online wihout having physically tried the item out. When I saw this unit, I was shocked. I paid just as much had I bought a brand new Patton. Turning it up full blast made more noise than my deceased fan and because of its small size, it does not circulate as well.Am I comparing a lightweight to a heavyweight? Sorry folks...it's just a cute, beautiful, pricey fan."
1,Crap!,"After about a month or two of use, all three of the bowls I purchased seem to leak water. They no longer stay ""skid proof"", and as the water slowly leaks, it cuases the bowl to move out of it's spot, which then inturn puts it in the path of my cats, and the bowl ends up completely dumped. DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,plastic junk,"picture shows a metal bowl, i received a cheap plastic bowl instead. stay away from unless you want a plastic cheap dog bowl."
3,not heavy weight!,"This works except I have one cat who upends this regularly. Food everywhere, which is exactly what I was trying to prevent by using this product. Otherwise attractive, but somehow thought it would be metal and it is plastic."
2,Disappointing,"Rich source material presented in an uncomfortable, ill conceived puzzle. The theme of the thing seems a vapor its story tellers."
1,Didn't even work,We bought one of these and put it in the supply cabinet. Months later (when we couldn't return it) we opened it up and it did not work in our printer. You're just better off getting an HP brand cartridge that actually works or that MIPO brand or the Office Depot brand remanufactured cartridge. Those are the ones that have worked for us. (We have the HP 825C.)
5,Interesting box set!,"One of those oddball releases by the Stuffies, this one includes 2 CDs, each with 4 tracks. A fun addition for the collectors out there.Disc 1:Welcome to the Cheap SeatsMe, My Mom, My Dad, and My BrotherWill the Circle Be UnbrokenThat's EntertainmentDisc 2:Welcome to the Cheap SeatsCaught in My Shadow (Bare Mix)Circlesquare (Butt Naked Mix)Can't Shape Up AgainMy favorite track is probably ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"" - a modern take on the hymn of the same name."
3,6 months off,"This book is doesn't reveal anything entirely new, but it has great ideas and an unconventional way of looking at life. I would definitely read this if you are or would like to become a world traveler."
4,Nice product,"A comprehensive book. Don't be fooled by the 6 months in the title. Material can be applied to any length sabbatical. The checklists look very useful. Much is devoted to negotiating the time off from an employer which didn't apply to me, but would to anyone pursuing a break from their career. In my case, I'll be between a military career and the next, but useful. Lots of new ideas on how to use the time to the fullest. Many I would have never imagined. It'd be nice if the next edition includes some note pages. I used the inside covers and plan to use the book up to and throughout our sabbatical. Includes a resource section that will be invaluable for planning. Many resources didn't include web addresses, but they're easy enough to find by searching with Google."
5,The most complete sabbatical book ever,"I found Six Months Off to be a phenomenal help in planning a sabbatical. The book gave me an an entire, but concise, philosophy or way of thinking about my sabbatical. The book also gave me a concrete and useful strategy for planning the sabbatical, covering ALL the bases from how to tell my boss to how to save money to places to help plan the actual time off and, then, finally for how I could re-enter the work force again. Truly phenomenal. The authors, led by Hope Dlugozima, have hit a home run with me."
5,Covers everything,"From planning to negotiating to enjoying, this book will help you through the whole process of fulfilling the dream of taking a well-deserved break from work in order to enjoy life. I've particularly enjoyed the travel tips, the ""cross Italy on a bike with a group"" is my favorite."
1,Disappointed,"This was a Mother's Day gift for my Mother, the foutain came without tubing. She called and Yankee promised to send the tubing, instead another fountain without tubing was sent. It has been almost a month and the fountain still does not work. I am very dispointed especially since a gift should only require the effort of putting it together not waiting for missing parts. I delayed the review hoping the correct tubing would come."
2,Beats a filter coffee maker and instant coffee,"A step up from the aluminum product, but I had expected more stainless steel. Not perfect craftsmanship, but still produces decent tasting coffee (much better than a filter coffee maker or, yuck, instant coffee - can you really call it that?). I still use it."
4,Not Compatible With Ramp Racer,"I got my 3yr old son this race car set for his birthday as well as the Melissa & Doug Ramp Racer Set. These cars are too tall to fit down the ramps. On their own they are perfectly fine wooden cars, but I got them specifically for the ramp racer setup."
4,This wooden car FLIES,"I like these cars a lot. The wheels spin smoothly, and even on carpet, you can propel these cars a fair distance before they stop.Additionally, you'll probably find that these cars interoperate just fine with many of the tracks and playsets made for other cars. These cars' widths are comparable to the cars that you would typically use in those structures. The only issue you might have is if the track has a low clearance. These cars are a bit on the tall side.Note: I bought these cars as a Christmas gift for my two year old son. The packaging's recommended minimum age is 3. However, I intended to play with these cars with my son, so I didn't balk too much at that. I'm glad I bought them. We've both had a lot of fun with them."
3,Package dirty,"The inside of the package was dirty, with a saw dust looking film. The cars were fine, no damage, only the packaging was affected."
3,ray j wanna be a thug now.,only reason this song sold was because the neptunes produced it nuff said.
2,Dont wast your money,"THIS IS NOT GAFT TAPE. Purchasing this is like purchasing duct tape. If you need gaft(stage tape), sometihng that will not leave a residue on your stage and cables then this is not it. This also has a gloss finish on it instead of a flat black so it will give off a reflection when under light."
5,Black Stage tape,"Nice and wide and lots of it. Very easy tear, easily removed without residue. What more could you ask for?"
2,Thought this would be a less expensive gaf tape.. I was wrong,"I purchased this product to secure cords on the floor of events, as I do with gaffer's tape. Because I was rushing the shipment and had other expenses I thought I could save a few $$$ since this tape was less costly than the 4"" black gaffer's tape; they looked like they served the same purpose and both had a cloth base.What I found is that this tape is glossy/shiny, and not matt like gaffer's is. This was a good thing in the environment where I wanted to draw attention to it on the floor.. wouldn't be so great if I wanted it to be discrete.My bigger dissatisfaction is that it does not tear nearly as clean as gaffer's tape does, and splits vertically up the run of the tape way more easily than gaffer's, making it a PIA when putting it down.I'd recommend spending the few extra $$ to get the gaffer's if it's in the budget."
4,the song,The Delgados. Once you listen to them you like it. They play wonderful melodies that seem to last forever. I admit they don't have the best voices or happy songs but it's still worth listening to over and over.
5,The best Delgados record to date.,"With Hate, The Delgados managed to top their last album, the fantastic The Great Eastern. Hate is a beautiful album, full of great (can I say pop?) songs. The songs ""All You Need Is Hate"" and ""Coming In From The Cold"" are especially good."
4,Depressive and beautiful,"Despite the title, Hate, the album is made of sweet and tender melodies.The first song, The Light Before We Land, is the most impressive and that's the one who can really express the mood of this band. But lyrics don't talk about love or passion, maybe the opposite. Here you can find terror, hate and death...here, melody and lyrics are terrible enemies...Unforgettable..."
3,Light Before We Land is the winner,"This is a solid band and a solid CD, although the male vocalist can't hold a candle to the easy, dreamy voice of the female vocalist. The tracks when they sing together and have choral accompaninment are the true strengths of the album (The Light Before We Land is easily the best song on the CD, and All Rise is also memorable).I was honestly a little dissapointed after purchasing this album since I had only heard Light Before We Land and the rest of the cd does not match the same superb level of beauty. The lyrics in the other songs suffer especially with some very bland word choices and lack of impact (""Child Killers"", despite having a great name, has a gratingly simplistic rhyming scheme in the opening lyrics). The almost-titular track, ""Hate Is All You Need"" is catchy and bitter and ""Light Before We Land"" is truly beautiful, but the rest of the songs are just good, not great."
2,Aptly Titled,"The sound of strings, a choir, and thunderous distortion opens the Delgados' fourth release Hate. This is both musical motif and a distillation of the sweet-sour dichotomy the Scottish quartet has explored over the course of its short history. Alun Woodward and Emma Pollock's respective worldviews have grown increasingly more black or white (depending on the song) as their music's become more baroque, thornier. The results are split. Invective, like revenge, is best served cold. Woodward's blissfully nasty pop masterpiece ""All You Need Is Hate"" and the bottom-of-the-barrel anthem ""If This Is a Plan"" are aces. Otherwise, it's tough going. The lyrics have no focus. The musicians are all over the place. The songs escape their control. And I sincerely hope that whomever did the string arrangements was the inspiration for the title."
4,Ben Live,Ben's live performance is well captured on this disc. Essential to the Harper afficionado and a must for anyone looking to sample the artist at his best .... live. The Innocent criminals are in full form supporting this intimate recording.
5,Square Silicone baking cups,"Haven't used these in the oven and may never. I bought them for reusable dividers in a Bento box. As such they are excellent. They are too lightweight to do well in the dishwasher, so they all ended up at the bottom of it but were unharmed. Nice colors!"
5,cute,"using them as dividers in my daughter's lunch box -- very cute, nice price and I think they work better than round ones, two fit easily on one side of the lunch bots duo."
5,Very useful,I like these over other brand I have. It's more flexible and easier to clean. The square shape surprisingly is functional.
4,great for baking,This is the first time I've used silicone baking cups. I use half of the cups for baking and the other half for making soaps. It is easy to use and to clean.
3,they work good,I was a big backer of these until I tried the XL ones which are just made a little better. These are still great and i will continue to use them but after the larger size ones I can only get so excited by these now.
4,Cute,Didn't know the size of the cup. I serve a purpose. I get a lot of use from them.. I will get larger baking cups.
5,So convenient!,"These are just perfect if you don't want to make a full pan of something. Also, I really adore the fact that they are square. They were very easy to use and super easy to get the food out of since all you have to do is peel the cup away.I am glad I purchased these and would purchase them again."
3,"Difficult to wash, but makes fun square cupcakes","These work well and do what they're supposed to. They seem to distribute the heat well and I haven't had any problems baking muffins and cupcakes in these. I do recommend placing them all on a baking sheet for easier transport in and out of the oven. While we were renovating our kitchen, we also used these to bake muffins in the toaster oven, since I couldn't find a tiny muffin pan to fit. However, they are difficult to wash as the fluted edges tend to get cupcake crumbs stuck in them and it's hard to scrub out all the tiny crevices. They'd be better if they just had smooth sides - they really don't need the ruffled border just to *look* like paper cups."
4,"Cute, functional, but tough to clean","These baking cups are really, really cute, and I love the colors. I love that being silicone, after they cool off a bit, you just flip what you baked right out of them. But as other reviewers have mentioned, the fluted sides make these a bit tougher to clean the fine crumbs out afterward.Still, even with that con, I am still very happy with them and would happily buy more of them if I had a need for them. They distribute heat well and evenly, and everything bakes up nicely."
3,Baking cups,"I was sorry to see these needed washing after use and and are too expensive to buy in large lots. Not much different than baking in a pan with or without paper cups. It is true they release a muffin easily, but so does a pan if the pan spray and recipe are in order."
4,Was super cute,"It arrived quickly, fit good, and looked as cute as the pick. my only complaint is that the white fur part on the top of the breast area was too loose, it didn't have much elastic, i had to use safety pins there. but overall, i liked it."
5,She looked great,"We needed this costume for a photo shoot and the model was a size '0' and luckily this fit. The model was a 'C' cup, so she did fill it out well. For the price we did not expect much, but it looked nice on film and since the model wore it she now owns it."
4,"Pretty good, yet to easy to solve the riddles",I liked this book but the riddles in it seemed to easy to solve to me yet I would still probably recomened it to others.
1,Save your money,"This book seems to have been written by, and in the style of the same pre-teen schoolboy it describes. Very trivial and trite. Val better keep his day job."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOOL! IT IS CHEAPLY MADE!,This is nothing more than pot metal garbage. I'm sorry I bought it. I will make my own. Tool broke while getting it into position without much pressure on it at all. It should have been made of steel.
1,"Never arrived, so I canceled the order and requested a refund","I ordered this book, but I never received it in 2.5 weeks, so I decided to cancel the order and got a refund from Amazon. A lot of other people who ordered this book seemeded to have trouble receiving it as well. I'd think twice before ordering it if I were you."
4,Good Health advice,"This book listed different foods and drinks and their nutritional values and contents. I found it to be an excellent reference when I was expecting my first child 20 years ago. I lost my copy, or perhaps I gave it away, I'm at a point now where I once again need this information, not for pregnancy, but for living healthier. I believe this book to be a good resource for anyone wanting to develop better eating habits."
1,Not worth the money - even on sale!,"I bought this, because we'd started having a real mouse problem in our home. I plugged it in, and I waited for the recommended 6 to 9 days. After 3 weeks, we set mouse traps in front of it and were catching mice daily. This didn't deter them at all.I actually came into the kitchen one evening to turn off a light that had been left on and saw a mouse sitting in front of the unit eating some crumb my daughter had dropped.The unit may have been defective (no way of checking), but I wouldn't have another one."
3,Not quite as useful as advertised,"This rodent repeller works well if it's aimed directly at an area. However, as far as chasing pests away in a square area, such as my attic, it fails to work well. I've found droppings in the area that should be protected. I did find that if the repeller is focused directly on an area, it will keep pests away from that area, but not necessarily from anyplace behind it or to the sides."
3,"Insects are gone, but the mouse hasn't been affected.","I've heard such good things about this product, so I shelled out the extra money for this brand as opposed to more inexpensive models. The day after I plugged it in in my very small kitchen, I saw a mouse scurry by. I wanted to cry! Now I've set up glue traps. However, I haven't seen a single bug since I installed the Pest Chaser."
1,sound generators against rodents,I am surprised that Amazon permits the sale of this equipment. Many scientific evaluations have shown that the sound generators have no effects what so ever against rodents-or for that matter against mosquitoes.
3,Average,"I got 2 of these for my home (a small two bedroom floor level condo) because my room-mate saw a mouse running around one day. There are two dogs in the house, so I didn't want to put down traps or poison because the dogs would get at it...Before the products arrived, the mouse had run out the back door one day. I still put these in to try and keep any pests from coming back. I don't know if they work on mice because the mouse had already left, but this does not work on other pests (i.e. bugs, spiders, roaches, or anything like that)...I still leave them because I don't want any mice to come back though.This is in Hawaii, on the island of Oahu."
3,We moved to a place with a lot more mice.,"In defense of this product, it's advertised to keep rodents away, and the wife was hoping for fewer spiders, so maybe we had unrealistic expectations. We still don't have rodents, but I don't think we have any fewer spiders either.*** Update *** Now that I live in Southern Georgia, I know that this doesn't keep mice out of the house, or at least out of the kitchen. This is plugged into a kitchen outlet, and a mouse was about 6 feet away happily munching on a piece of dog kibble the other night."
5,SEEMS TO WORK GREAT,"I ordered this product to be used in an older house to keep the mice out. Impossible to plug up every hole. I had used at least $30 of D-Con which worked great but was getting expensive and there was no end in site. I keep the D-Con out,still,to be sure the device is working but I have had no more signs of mice. I ordered another one for a cabin at the family farm. Of course, when winter comes the field mice look for a winter home. So far, no mice there."
5,Very satisfied with the attention to detail,"My daughter Annie got this for me as a Valentine's Day gift, and I just opened it up a few days ago - Boy, do I wish I'd opened it up sooner! I need work on my memory and my balance, and she had mentioned that this video could help me out and it certainly has. I am very satisfied with the attention given to detail with very clear explanations, which I believe has really improved my memory and my understanding of these movements. What a considerate gift, one I shall soon give to others!"
5,Not like the other Tai Chi videos at all (and that's GOOD!),"I'm new to tai chi practice,and I've been looking for a video to guide me through the movements in between classes. I have seen several other Tai Chi videos which claim to be instructional, but really aren't. This is the best thing I've seen yet - it shows all the exercises from several different angles, so even a klutz like me can finally get it! I mean it - if you think you are uncoordinated (two left feet) and/or you are rehabbing from an old injury (blew out my ACL while skiing-ouch!)this a great video for you, because there is a lot of time taken to explain how to do it correctly AND safely, which was a real concern of mine. So I highly recommend it, totally worth the bucks."
2,One word: Ouch,"You can always debate whether this book is ""art"" or not, but the fact is I am worried about what happened to some of the subjects. Helmut? Are you okay? I think Mapplethorpe wanted to shock, and he did, but I found the pictures had too much pain in them to be appreciated. I was deadened to what Mapplethorpe wanted to say, if he wanted to say anything at all. Ouch, ouch, ouch."
4,"If you have to cook elk, a book you need to have","My husband forgot to tell me he was a hunter before I married him. Unfortunately for me, he's a good hunter and we've had at least one elk in our freezer every season for years. I'm a city girl and this cookbook has been a lifesaver. The sections on the care and cooking of elk are really useful. The recipes even taste good (considering it's elk). The Ragin' Cajun stew has become a mainstay of my winter cooking rotation.The rest of the cookbook tends towards hearty midwestern fare -- not exactly Cooking Light, but good on those days when comfort food is a priority."
5,Useful,I bought this book a gift for my mother when her husband started hunting elk each year. She gives it rave reviews for recipes.
4,Good cookbook for wild game,"Personally, I love this book so much I bought one for my mother. We have a source of elk, venison and wild turkeys so it's nice to have some ideas on how to prepare it."
3,Brenthaven Edge I Sleeve (Light Blue),"A very attractive product, excellent quality for the money. Gets dirty quickly, however, if you carry it around as I do, and the power cord doesn't fit nicely in the case itself. But if you drive in a nice car to work, and don't mind putting the powercord in your other bag, it would work. All in all, a nice product, but I wish I had gotten it in black."
4,"Great case for a MacBook, but go for the black one.","Just bought a MacBook and wanted to make sure it was protected. After looking at the various cases available, I settled on the Brenthaven Edge I in Black. Saw the Light Blue version, and even in the store it was getting dirty already.The computer fits into the well padded case snuggly. The hard edges give it a more structured look than many of the sleeves available these days. But it's still small enough to fit into a standard backpack when necessary. The handle and shoulder strap are both well-constructed and should maintain their integrity for some time to come.Be warned, you'll have to carry the power converter separately, as there is no room inside. The Front Row remote fits into the inside pocket nicely though.After searching several outlets, Amazon has the best price currently available."
4,Hot Dancefloor Track. Check their website culture-beat.com,"I am glad that Culture Beat is still around. They did not change their sound,altough there is a new vocalist. It is still driven by synths not just an empty beat. This is sure to be a smash club hit, buy ""Insanity"" today."
5,Awesome Music,"Culture Beat just keeps getting better and better! This single ""Insanity"" has intelligent lyrics and great music. The mixes are all different, so it's an amazing ride from beginning to end!"
5,this was a replacement - last one lasted 13 years,These things are great we use it for suplemental heat in our bathroom - the first one lasted 13 years and the replacement fit right in where the old one was
2,This fan... ummm... blows.,"Ok. It's a fan and how much does one really require from a fan? You want it to huff and puff and blow the air around... simple, right? Well this one does that and does it well, but it makes a LOT of noise about it. So much so that I have to turn up the television just to hear it over this hellacious wind beast. Being the ideal neighbor I am, I feel bad about the potential noise of my television blaring (read: I don't want them to know I rather enjoy those Golden Girl marathons on TNT), so I close my windows. Are you seeing the irony here? For those of you who missed it, here is the Fan Review For Dummies version... Honeywell fan bad. Make owner sad."
5,Best Fan Around!,"I have 4 vornado fans, some for close to 10 years. They are the greatest air circulators out there and worth every penny. The motor just won't quit! Some of them I run year round to provide better air circulation and they continue to work like a charm. There are many imitators out there but I don't think they can compete with the workmanship of the vornado."
2,Noisy,"I have two other Vornado fans that I am really happy with so I decided to buy one for my office at work. Unfortunately, the 510W Compact Air Circulator is so noisy that I can't use it unless I'm by myself and using headphones. At the two lowest speeds the blades seem to be unbalanced and at the highest speed it moves so much air (usually a good thing) that it bothers my neighbors on both sides (I'm actually in an office so there's no ""cube effect"").I fault myself for not returning it right away for an exchange but the fan obviously was never inspected before it was shipped."
5,It's still going strong!,"I bought this model from Amazon 3 years ago. It is still working just as well as it did right from the box. Small in size, this thing can blow you away on high speed. It has excellent adjustability, speed control, and best of all....it's built to last.I am truly impressed by this company's products."
5,Quiet and works very well,"We bought two of these to help circulate the air in our small NYC apartment, and they work very very well. They are much quieter than a regular fan, and they keep the air moving, which helps the air conditioner cool off the room better (instead of hot and cold spots). I've left mine on for over a week at a time with no problems."
5,Terrific Product!,"I bought this product, not really knowing what would make it any different from any other fan we have had. Well, I found out! It is awonderful air circulator, to help keep the air in a room fresh and refreshingly cool. It is calibrated so that one can set it to pretty much run all the time as an air circulator(really helpful to me, as an asthmatic and allergy sufferer) and can also be set at various speeds to produce major cooling as a top quality fan would do. I have been totally impressed with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone. It makes all the difference in a roomto have fresh air circulating."
2,Not what I wanted.....,"I wanted the older version with the variable speed control, not the three-speed version. While the 3-speed is quieter than most fans on low, it still makes a fair amount of noise. When I turn my older variable speed version to the lowest setting, I can still get a cool breeze and barely hear it at all, which is perfect for sleeping under on a warm night. The picture on the Amazon site showed the wrong (old) version. I can't imagine why Vornado quit making the continuous adjsutment version, but they did. I've been trying to find one unsuccesfully for a couple of months now, and thought I had hit paydirt based on the picture displayed on Amazon.To be clear, the fan did work as it should have, and Home & Beyond took it right back when I returned it, it just wasn't what as shown on amazon. I'm still out the shipping both ways because of the incorrect picture shown on Amazon."
2,Beware - Polsteins would switch US-made 510 for 530,"Own several Vornado 510 and 610's for a few years, quite happy.Decided to add another one and got a substitute - Mexico-made 530,with substandard quality and unbalanced rotor. So my 2-star rating is mostly about vendor fashion of conducting business, fan itself is perhaps worth 3 stars. Now I am stuck with this one, because would loose $8.50 from original payment + return cost.But if you are not yet in this trap, beware of Polsteins and their business practices."
5,same as the 550,same great performance as the vornado550 which i also have...and the price was great...i got three of them.
4,Review,I enjoyed this book very much. I also learned through reading it the many different ways that officers can become coppupt and how to notice corruption before it even starts. This is an excellent book and I do recommend it to anyone who is interested in corruption of police and their departments.
4,Very good down-tempo electronica,"This CD was recently reviewed on NPR, and it offers a nice mix of mellow electronica. Most cuts don't have vocals. Two that do are marvelous, featuring intertwining lyrics and melodies. The music weaves pure electronic beats with piano in some places, synth organ in others, and slow melodic tempos. The sounds just float through the air. Great CD to chill out to, and the music seems to have staying power --I've played over and over and over and haven't grown tired of it yet.I recommend this CD if you're looking for some thoughtful, sensitive music to live, work or drive by."
4,King of Woolworths,"I'm glad I discovered these folks, they have some good music. My absolute fav. is ""Nuada"". I would buy this entire album just for this song. Check it out!!"
5,"Ah! My Goddess (Oh! My Goddess, Ah! Megami-sama) Vol.2 CD","WOW!! I luv it!! It even has a track of Keiichi singing which is the coolest!! I think it's a great CD to buy, (hehe I accedently bought a ""SM"" version of it, whoops!) but even though it's still great!! Dosen't every one remeber the time Belldandy sang when she was making her cake? It's here!!"
4,A Classic Autobiography,"This book is a must read.Written by a lady with tongue-in-cheek,tear-in-eye outlook it's just plain good reading.An octogenarian looks back at her life with a spellbinding wit and a strength not often seen.No ""feel sorry for me""in this girl-she's a hoot."
3,Not true to size,Wonderful shoe but it does not fit true to size. I always wear a 7 but with this item I had to order a 6.5.
3,"It looks really pretty, but..",This pair of shoes is gorgeous. I like the black and silver color combination and it looks really elegant to wear to any sort of formal dinners. And I have to agree that it does not fit true to size also it hurts my feet pretty bad after 10 minutes of standing or walking.
1,Product rusts,"I thought if I paid more money I'd get a better product. Not the case. Although, they claim ""rust protected"", it rusted after a few months. I should have returned it, but it is too late. The warranty is only for one year."
1,Not Stainless Steel more like stainless steal,I purchased this product about a year ago and it is completely rusted. Had I known this I would have purchased it at the Container Store. It does everything else it should except not rust. I don't even have it under the shower head I have it placed on the opposite side and it still rusted. What a waste of money.
1,Difficult assembly,"The instructions were confusing and difficult, and the product weak. I have an engineering degree and I struggled to follow them. I am an independent woman but, geez, throughout the assembly I kept thinking that it sure would have been a lot easier with a man around. I've assembled huge garage shelving and Ikea kitchen cabinets by myself... but I didn't have the muscle to get this little caddy in place.I bought this product for about $30 at Target. I bought a different caddy at BB&B; for the same price and it was infinitely easier to assemble and a stronger product."
2,no so great,i bought thease shoes in june and in january now and i'm ready to buy a new pair soo they dont last a real long time. they are also really hard to clean. i wont buy anouther pair
5,Can You See the Colors?,"This composer sees colors when he ""hears"" the music he is composing (it's called synaesthesia). I don't, but it was interesting listening and trying to imagine what colors he was seeing. Aside from that, the music itself is interesting, just for listening. Give it a try and see it it causes you to see colors!"
5,LOVE THIS WAX!,"Worth every penny. Relatively easy to take off, and the coating last for MONTHS! This is the best wax I have found so far. Go Collinite!"
5,Collinite Car Wax,"Excellent product. The best car wax I have ever used, far superior to any of the name brand products. Try it."
4,goes on and comes off easy,Super detergent resistant finish. Unfortunately I won't be able to test it's durability in sunlight as I will always keep the car garaged.
5,This is the one to buy! Perfect in every way!,"I ordered 4 books on being a flower girl for my 4.5 year old granddaughter. This was the best of the 4 books I ordered. My granddaughter wasn't very excited about being a flower girl but this book changed her mind! She absolutely glowed when I read this to her! Each turn of the page was a delight! The book explains the steps to prepare for the big day. The author didn't miss a detail and wrote a cute little story along the way. My granddaughter's expression and soft ""Ohh"" when she saw the page with the bride in her wedding dress was priceless!"
5,Great Way To Get the Flower Girls Ready for The Big Day!,"I actually gave this to my flower girls ahead of our wedding because they're very young and I wanted their moms to start preparing them with this story so they can know what to expect and be comfortable. It's a lovely book for the girls and their moms seem to really love it, too. Plus, it's so inexpensive! Definitely the best book I've seen as far as having a story kids can relate to and absolutely the lowest price."
2,Wish the story was better,The pictures in this book are cute and colorful. I'm not impressed though by the actual story. it wasn't very interesting and in the story the flower girl's younger brother didn't want to be a ring bearer. it also showed the young boy trying to hide under the bride's dress during the ceremony. these are just things I wouldn't want children thinking about.
1,disappointed,I recieved this book and it was going to be a gift for my flowergirl. She is very young and I am trying to get her excited. When I recieved the book I opened it to find torn pages and a garage sale sticker on the cover. I had to purchase the book again with another seller.
3,Cute flower girl gift,"It was a cute gift to give our two flower girls, but since neither of them raved about it I have to assume it was nothing spectacular. It seemed cute to me and my wife. Three stars for average."
4,Great for 6-yr-old,"Bought this for my 6-yr-old niece who was going to be in our wedding but didn't really understand what her role was. It was great! Her older sisters read it over and over to her. It is written to be read to the girl, rather than have the girl read it."
3,A Little too old,"I bought this book as a gift for our flower girl, she was almost four at the time of our wedding. The book is great, but it would have been better suited for an old girl. It's pretty long, and she had trouble sitting through it."
3,"Great art, but wordy....","The art in this book is great, but I felt that overall this is a great book for older flower girls between the ages of 6 and 8 (the flower girls participating in my wedding are 4 and 5). The text in the book was a little too wordy in some parts, however the duties of the flowergirl was covered very well."
3,Ok but not one of the greats...,"I was surprised no one has reviewed these recordings. I am a big fan of Pires and have enjoyed her work with colleague Dumay.Sadly, while there are some interesting moments in this collection, I would advise you to audition prior to purchase, or if you are only to have one set of these works in your collection, do look elsewhere.I just was not inspired by the performances and the recording itself has a bit of an odd acoustic quality to it -- overly resonant -- that bothers me as well.I'm damning with faint praise. These are great musicians. There is beauty here, but I have heard more insights from these musicians in previous recordings."
2,More than a pocketful!,"I was expecting something the size of a standard man's wallet, but this is way longer than that. I ended up buying another wallet at a local (not online) merchant in order to avoid repeating this mistake."
1,Over-priced,"We need sugar free desserts, but this price is way ridiculous unless it is a typo. Comes out to $1 per ounce of cookies; Amazon should be aware they're charging more than 3 times the price to be had at a grocery store, on top of paying shipment. No go."
1,There are no words in English for this telephone.,"You will be very very sorry I you spend even $.01 for this junk.I will bet you any amount that no one at Bell South owns this telephone.How could quality control allow this junk to be released to the marketplace. Apparently they are not experienced. Please, please don't buy this phone or you will be very sorry you did. The sound is horrible and the one you are talking to think you are under water. I only answer it when I""m near it but I do have other phones so I stay away from this junk. I can't wait for it to break so I can deliver it to it's proper place. The garbage.You cannot understand the people on the other end. YOU BETTER LISTEN TO ME. LET BELL SOUTH KEEP THIS JUNK. THEY NEED TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS IF THEY CAN'T PRODUCE BETTER PRODUCTS.THIS PRODUCT DESERVE NO STARS"
1,Horrible quality,Very low volume even on highest setting. Constant static. Keypad doesn't light up. Not very user friendly keypad.
3,Alright,"This was an alright cd, the music was great, some of the lyrics were great, etc. Only Violent J wrote it, so its not Zug Izland. Most of the track are too mellow, and some of the more rock songs are kinda like punk. if your a juggalo who liked Amazing Jeckl Brothers, youde like this."
1,A big dissapointment,"I waited a while for this album and when I bought it all I had to do was listen to it once and that was it. The only good songs I thought were Sunny day, Fly, and Cry, but other than those i thought the rest was terrible. But it seems to be that i'm the only one who feels that way because everyone else loves it, oh well."
3,Good solo effort. Smacks of The Who a bit too much though,"""One of the Boys"", one of Mr. Daltry's earlier forrays outside of The Who, reminds us that Pete Townsend does not hold a monopoly on talent and creativity in the British Invasion rock band. The well-recognized ""Who Sound"" crops up routinely across all tracks, but so what, it's a good sound, and well worth hearing."
4,Roger that,"I've always liked Roger Daltrey; I think he's been a great front man for the Who. Tougher than Jagger, rougher than Plant, but still capable of delivering some very powerful and emotional vocals, especially on Who efforts such as ""Who's Next"" and (of course) ""Tommy.""Unfortunately, Daltrey's solo albums never fared as well, partly because he wasn't singing songs by a certain Mr. Townshend. But ""One of the Boys"" is a welcome exception. I recently purchased this on vinyl, partly because I used to have the original and partly because ... I admit it -- I like this album cover.But it's the songs that win the day, from the introspective ""Parade"" to the high energy of ""Avenging Annie."" Daltrey's in great voice here, and the set of songs is top-notch. He co-writes a few of the tracks, too, and does a very credible job of it indeed.Who fans should like this, of course, but anyone who enjoys classic rock will, too."

1,"Good instructions, poor designs","The strong point of this book is the instructions for the various projects, including a pillow, an eyeglass case, luggage tags, towel borders, etc. The designs of the larger projects, such as the tiger and the polar bears, are adequate. But some of the small designs are incredibly bad - my neighbor and I had to look at the design title to figure out what some of the animals were supposed to be! Also the charted graphs are printed so lightly as to make them difficult to read."
3,This CD is worth buying if only to hear Vikki Carr!,"Vikki Carr easily outshines the other so-called singers on this CD. The CD is worth buying, however, because the listener can simply fast forward to the tracks by Vikki."
2,Mildly entertaining,Mildly entertaining 1970's drive in schlock about a scissor wielding killer terrorizing a small farm community. The lead character is a Swedish spinster with issues (constant flashbacks to her childhood suggest this even though the flashbacks themselves don't show anything particularly disturbing) whose sewing scissors disappear around the time the murders start. Is she the killer or a potential victim? Since this is a pre-slasher horror film the violence is pretty mild. Haunts isn't particularly suspenseful but it's a decent enough time-waster if you like 70's B movies. Then there's the transfer. This looks pretty much like a VHS tape. The bright scenes are watchable enough but the dark scenes are frequently so washed out that you can barely see anything at all. Keep your expectations very low if you decide to watch this one.
1,A haunting experience,"It would be nice to write a review of this DVD, however the disc was defective and would not read in either of the DVD players I have in the home, I would think that Amazon would at least check the product before it is allowed to be shipped."
4,good for it's price,"A few items are hard to get them out or put back in the case.However, over all this is a great buy. It's very useful and compact."
2,Not very good,The plastic case is really chincy and does not hold the tools well. The tools are better suited for a dorm room and very basic home repairs.
4,Great Tool Kit,"I think it is a really good tool kit but sometimes is so difficult to get the da** things out. Another thing, I have trouble closing all for locks of the case and it looks much much neater in the picture than in real life. One last thing, it is amazing how small the kit is, it does not occupy any space!Other than that it is great!"
4,Exactly What I wanted.,"It's not the highest quality set, but I knew that going in. It has everything I need and is a great price. THANKS!"
2,"Great tools, case is horrendous","The actual tools in this set are great. They are high quality and function exactly as they are supposed to.The biggest downside to this product is the case in which the tools are kept. It's made of EXTREMELY cheap plastic, and the tools fall out of their slots when carrying it around.This product is fine if you're going to keep it as a bare-minimum home tool kit, but don't expect anything more out of it."
3,Good For The Price,"I purchased this product just to have access to some tools that I would commonly need around the house. It comes with many pieces of the most majorly used tools. The case is a good solid case (a little too solid) at some points because as others have said, the screwdriver bits and wrenches are hard to get out of the case without prying or leveraging something under it to pop it out.The only major problem I had with it was that the pair of needle nose pliers had rust around the connection joint on the side that was facing the case. This shows me it was either in contact with water or was stored somewhere with a lot of moisture.Its a good product just for use around the house."
1,cheap and broken,"So, I wanted this to keep in my car... I should have simply purchased the individual items... the small phillips set had a broken case and three bent and one broken screwdriver. The tape measure was also broken as was the volt meter. I will be returning this item. I did attempt to call and go to their website to see if they would replace the broken items but could NEVER get ANYONE to answer or to get their website to work. Just not worth the hassle."
3,Simple thing to have for simple emergency repairs.,"These are simple tools that fall into ""man I wish I had a pair of..."" category. Just mass produced stuff that might come in handy if you need to open up a water valve, cut a wire, hammer in a nail, or screw/unscrew stuff. Obviously I do not use any of it for my home projects - the tool case is in my emergency go-kit next to crank-up flashlights and med kit. Rather competitively priced, but certainly something you can easily find at a local ""seconds"" store at this or better price."
4,good enough,"Mom wanted a set of tools around her place... these should work out for the very small fix jobs she's gonna have,.. I wouldn't have them at my house though.."
1,Bad Quality,"RE : Apollo Precision Tools DT9408 53-Piece Household Tool KitSeems like good quality on the site, but very bad quality. some parts are so tight in the box that cant remove them and some are so loose that they dont fix in the box at all. Very very bad quality of the box and all the tools, some hav marks and rust also. extremely disappointing for the cost it is charged for."
2,Less Than Thrilled,"This tool set has almost everything I need, but it is next to impossible to get the tools out of their little compartments without a crowbar. And snapping them back in is no easy feat either. When I need a tool, I want to be able to grab it, not have to stop what I'm doing to find something to pry it out. The tools themselves are okay, I guess. I'm mostly just mad because my fingers are all beat-up from trying to get tools out. Sigh..."
1,This playlist is totally wrong.,"Don't buy this CD for the song listings on this site. The tracks are completely different. It's the correct title and label information, but the track listing is incorrect."
4,Cheesy but informative,"I bought this video a very long time ago. It's pretty cheesy, but definately worth the money for it's inclusion of coming attraction previews of Deadtime Stories, Bloodeaters, Don't Open the Window, Suspiria, Midnight, Vampyres, The Majorettes, Night of the Living Dead, and others. It also has interviews with Linnea Quigley, Bobbi Bresee, Tom Savini, George Romero, and Russell Streiner. So get it as a guilty pleasure and a reminder of an era of horror that has come and gone."
2,Very disappointed,"When I got this, there was moisturizer all over the inside of the box because a lot squirted out. The pump doesn't work well at all. When I push it, a large amount squirts everywhere. I am not sure if I got a defective bottle or if they are all like this.As for the lotion itself, I like that it's very light but it just seems to sit on top of my skin. I really haven't noticed any benefits from using it. I would not order it again."
5,Edushape Medium Boxes,"I love it is very useful to take things on the go, I would buy more in the future"
1,Much smaller than they look online,These boxes will be going back. They are very short and the bottoms are split so that things will fall through if you lift them.
2,AVERAGE.,"This cd is ok. Its not the very best their is, but it does deserve some recognition. The very best song I think is represent yo block.If you like mediocre rap, this is for you"
5,Darkwing Duck; the lighter side of crimefighting . . .,"That masked mallard of crimefighting now has his own video collection! Disney's ""Darkwing Duck"" is always fresh and funny, and always a delight to watch! When I heard that select episodes of ""Darkwing Duck"" were to come out on video, I was elated. After all, what person with a sense of humor could resist the capers of the caped crimefighter of St. Canard, Darkwing Duck? Along with his pilot sidekick Launchpad and adopted daughter Gosalyn, Darkwing Duck helps to keep his city safe from such evil villans as Bushroot, Megavolt, and Negaduck. Darkwing Duck himself is hilarious as he tries to juggle the responsibilities of crimefighting and parenthood. Crimefighting is no picnic, and Gosalyn can be quite a handful. I would recommend this video collection to anyone with a funnybone, even to those who enjoy a heavy dose of action with their laughter. ""Darkwing Duck"" amply supplies both."
5,Whether or not you like who we are we are the Weather--,"This is one of the greatest hiphop albums of all time! If you like The Weather check out ""Live Airplane Food,"" which is a live EP of Busdriver freestyling over Daedelus and his live band doing music from Invention. Also, 2mex and Busdriver's new live album has Busdriver doing a track from The Weather, ""Fine for a Robot."""
1,what?!!!!!!!!,"i was seriously disappointed when i heard this album !!!!!!!!!i didnt go listen with a biased ear, however knowing the potential of the two artists compelled me to believe that could have made some serious hard hitters. They seemed as if all the intended on doing was stoking eachothers ego ! any real hip hop head would agree and not get caught up in the vanity of pseudo artsy sttyling."
1,A real Shotgun blast in the Back effect,"I find it interesting that the author would make such a wonderful effort to help children, after having murdered parents. I wonder if he sent autographed free copies to the children of the people he murdered.I also find it interesting, that in over 20 years on death row, he was only able to write a handful of ""children's books"".That these books would find their way into our public school systems, where this man takes on the role of Martyr and Folk Hero, speaks volumes about our schools.The book is as shallow as the man who wrote it."
1,Not Recommended for Educators,"I am a gang and youth violence expert working with the San Diego County Office of Education, Safe Schools Unit. I have alerted many of our schools about the series of books by Stanley ""Tookie"" Williams. I do not recommend the purchase of this book. The content of the books are not appropriate for young people. The images of gangs are not accurate (Too much negative sterotyping). The book is written in a simplistic style that will quickly bore young students. Youth need to critically examine information not be talked down to. You may email me for alternate suggestions for gang prevention books for youth."
3,not a great voice,"Fabian was a product of the 50s/60s star-making machine.His voice is not great. (Nor was his acting.) But serviceable.And these productions are mediocre at best.Still, there are a few minor gems - notably ""Hound Dog Man"" and ""Tiger.""Good for a trip down memory lane."
5,fish food,Our koi and our goldfish really jump up for this food.They have all been really healthy this year.
5,Hard To Put Down,"I've been caught-up in the whole Sasquatch/Cryptozoology phenomenon since Jr. High, and consider myself very well read on the subject; John Green, Rene Dahinden, Loren Coleman, etc. But found this particular book extremely interesting. I was aware of several remote sightings in our 49th state, but didn't realize how frequent the sightings, and the rich prospect of scientific breakthrough. I wouldn't be surprised if the final solving of this mystery occurs in Alaska. I did however expect more reports from British Columbia and Washington State, but past publications, and the numerous Internet websites cover those areas quite well. Stunning eyewitness accounts, and absorbing data. I can't wait for future works on the subject from Mr. Alley."
2,"Good, concise intro, but the rest is fluff","The first 100 pages provides a good concise overview of COM programming. It is well written and to the point. However, the remaining section (250 pages) of examples was disappointing. The examples were shells only and had only a summary explanation of each. The same content was copied over and over in all the examples. For example, the ""How to register the DLL"" explaination, which took almost a page, was copied verbatim in the other examples. Instead of building on a concept, it was simply repeated. 90% of the examples were MFC generated code. It seemed to be more an attempt to fatten up the book rather than to provide content. In short, I think one would be better off with another book that can provide more in-depth examples that one can learn from. Not just the same MFC code again and again."
4,Nice and for a good price,"I put these on my honda and work very well, recommend them for others thinking of tricking out there bikes."
1,German Pub Hits,"A warning to all -- don't buy this CD expecting to get the original artists or original composition of the songs -- this CD contains disco versions of the German greats. If you are looking for the original songs, then I'd recommend going to amazon.de and searching for the word ""schlager""."
1,Please keep searching,"I only write this to save well-intentioned people from wasting their money and suffering disappointment. I checked out this series from our local library (big fan of 'try before you buy') and I'm glad I did. Seeing the poor animation and 'teachy' structure of the videos helped me avoid spending my hard-earned money. My daughter, who has a good share of quality Spanish books, CDs, and videos, asked me to turn it off after only a few minutes. The best Spanish products are engaging and and true learning happens as a result of the child being engaged. This was your run of the mill, poor quality, ""listen and repeat"" format, that tried way too hard to TEACH and not enough to ENTERTAIN. (bored kids aren't learning kids) Please keep searching."
2,Not great,"Don't love this video, the animation is poor and my kids just don't enjoy watching it. It tends to drag on a bit slowly.Not a great way for my kids to learn spanish."
1,Not for beginners,"I borrowed this DVD from the library to try it before buying it and I'm glad I did. The commentary moved too quickly for my 7-year-old, who soon got frustrated and then bored. They repeated the words and/or phrases too fast for her, or me, to be able to listen, repeat and learn. For a child who really enjoys learning Spanish, this did not cut it."
3,Not for beginners!,"I purchased this DVD for my bright grandchildren, aged 4 and 2 because they seemed to be very attracted to ""DORA"" and her Spanish pronunciations, often using her simplistic lessons in their everyday vocabulary with ease.When I sat with them to view ""HOLA AMIGOS"" for the first time, I realized that it was definitely not for beginners, using complicated sentence structuring and often blurred pronunciations. I had four years of Spanish in school and know that this DVD is definitely not an entry presentation, especially for young children.The visual seemed to have clear connective attraction which kept their interest but the overly complex sentences lost appeal.If this DVD was created by someone who did not already have a Spanish accent, it might be more easily assimilated for someone new to the language, English speaking and not of Spanish descent.I feel this DVD was incorrectly marketed under the guise of entry-level. It is not."
4,Tucson Troubador,"I've got all of Troy's stuff & consider myself a friend, having hung out & listening to him night after night years ago at The Maverick in Tucson.His self titled new album is about to drop on May 11 & I've been previewing it on his website. I got a feeling that Troy is about to blowup & be the next Dierks Bentley....."
5,Amazing!!!,The music and sound quality are phenomenal. Well worth listening to if you enjoy Hindustani classical styles.
5,FUNNY AND WITTY BOOK -- SOMETHING TO REMEMBER,"The Master and Magarita is one hillarious book. The devil decides to show up in this world and decides to throw parties and look for a muse! Turn up the circus as all hell broke lose! Truly funny, witty and absolutely charming. Had to reread it over and over again."
2,Good benefits with bad side effects,"This product is good , it worked for me . I used to take twice a day morning and evening. Later i switched to once a day , but finally i had stop the intake on my Doctors advice. Because after 2nd week of usage i started getting mild migraines and later intense one so i had to stop."
2,Junko,I have not found this product to reduce the ringing in my ears. Maybe I have real bells up there.
4,"It seems to work, no issues.","Don't expect some amazing burst of memories to flood in. Everyday life becomes easier to keep up with and it doesn't take so much effort to remember things, but that's about it. I bought mine to help remember dreams and it certainly does that for me, but I still say it should have a little stronger effect."
5,Depressing... But great,"This book is a ver depressing story. I still loved it. The characters were in depth and believable. Contrary to some other reviews advice, I believe you don't have to read the prequel at all. I haven't read it, and Broken Bridge is still my favoritee book. It is a great educational story, as well, with lots of information from both sides of the Arab Israeli conflict. Some parts make me cry, yet some are funny too. The book is on the whole the best one I have ever read."
2,Nothing new.,"I'm having a hard time trying to figure out how people are calling this a great documentary. It doesn't reveal any more than the copious press surrounding YHF did. In fact, the one scene it SHOULD have had, it missed totally, that being the final falling out between Jeff and Jay. It didn't really show me a behind the scenes of making the record, and as I said all of the record company intrigue I knew about well ahead of seeing the film. I guess all the positive glowing reviews are a testament to the cult of Wilco."
4,Well-done documentary,"The best documentaries just happen to be in the right place at the right time. This one was done at a very exciting and turbulent time in Wilco's history. They were tracking and producing their masterpiece album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. They were dropped by their label with the album in hand. A key band member was fired. And the camera caught it all. Lucky us!"
4,i am trying to break your heart,"stellar dvd... only complaint is that the performance features have too many facial close-ups... would have liked to see more of the guitar playing. However, in no way should that stop anyone from buying."
3,Meh,"It's OK. As others mentioned, the music performances are great but the rest of it, kinda dull. I remember reading about this when it first came out about how it documented the band's struggle with their label in getting YHF done. That's one part of this film but not the plot thread. Too bad.Also, I agree that with the reviewer who said they were unnecessarily cruel to Jay here. If you know anything about the Uncle Tupelo/Son Volt/Wilco story you know that Tweedy's no saint. Sure, Wilco is TWEEDY'S band and Jay what's-his-name isn't even an original, immediately post Tupelo member. But still, YHF is a great album and Jay must have been integral. He sort of seems set up and then ganged up on in this film."
4,4.5 to be more precise,"I took off a half star because I wanted more performances.This chronicle of the laborious process of Wilco's ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"" showed how making the album was riddled with label problems, lineup changes, and migraines, just to name a few.The band's label had changed ownership, and the new owners didn't like the album, told Wilco to change it, and Wilco said no. They decided to split ways.During the making of the album, Jay Bennett, veteran Wilco member, was asked to leave the band. Tweedy felt he couldn't work with him anymore, Bennett thought it was some sort of coup. Who knows?...Even though I thought there was a lack of performance, that isn't to say what was provided wasn't sweet. The in-studio performances of ""I'm Always in Love"", the live versions of ""Pot Kettle Black"" and ""Radio Cure"", and Tweedy's solo concert were excellent. Call me a Wilco junkie, but I could always use more of their performances."
5,Total Body Pilates,"This is a great dvd ,and just to let you know Walmart carries this in their fitness area for 14.97...."
2,Didnt come with ball,Read all reviews about it. The title said it came with ball but it was not in package. I was dissatisfied that i had to buy one.
1,"Great idea, poor delivery","As a 40+ new mom, I looked forward to finding a positive community within these covers. Instead, I found a lot of ""woe is me"" and ""misery loves company"". For almost all of us, children after 40 is a hard earned choice. This book has a negative beat to it, maybe because the writing is so poor. Clearly the author's analytical skills are so rough that she had to rely on interview annecdotes. I bought this book because I waited so long for it at the library. I wish I had waited longer."
4,"Ellen Ostrow, Ph.D.","As a professional coach to many midlife women, I've found Nancy London's book to be an extremely helpful resource. ""Hot FlashesWarm Bottles"" is reassuring and enlightening for someonebeginning motherhood in her forties. When your bodyis sandwiched between childbirth and menopause and your lifeis sandwiched between caring for children and aging parents,a book specifically addressed to the challenges you're facingcan provide immeasurable support."
3,Ok,"I remember this record (yes record) from when I was a kid, so I ordered this for my daughter. I had no idea it was 4 CD's all of the songs I remembered were only on one CD. So it might have been nice if they were sold separately. Totally worth buying though just for the memories, and to pass them along to my child."
4,"Kids loved it! A clean, fresh snowfall on a classic.","This movie is a great update of the classic, with the added insight of today's world. It's got humor that appeals to today's kids and voices they're familiar with: the guys who do Spongebob and Patrick!! (Burt Reynolds is great to hear narrating and singing--he's from my era!) This version, finally, holds my kids' attention. I am relieved to have a good Christmas (Holiday) movie for my kids to watch, without having to overcome some of the dated references. Wholesome, funny, fast-paced. Well done!My kids are running around my house quoting the movie--which is the true barometer of a good movie these days. They've probably burned a laser-hole in the DVD by now!Highly recommended DVD."
1,awful movie,"i assume there arent many reviews for this movie because everyone else must already know how bad it is. my husband and i sat with my 3 year old daughter one day to watch this. i dont LOVE frosty, myself, i rather watch rudolph or other stop motions from way back, but i like him. this movie however is awful, the plot, characters, the entire thing from start to finish was horrible. it was so bad, that we took it away after so my daughter wouldnt see to get rid of it. i know many people dont really like frosty returns, but this makes frosty returns look like it should get an oscar."
4,Bakes well...,"But, the pan and lid had significant scratches all over. They didn't appear to have ruined the pan so I went ahead and used it.The rolls baked well, but when removing from the oven to check them, the pan made crackling noises. Not sure what the noises were but the rolls were good."
2,Mine Has Holes,"I bought this pan in September of 2010, and I've been happy with its performance since then. However, I took it out to use it today, and I noticed that there are holes in the side. I've taken care of it according to the directions, so I was surprised to see that it had those holes in it. It also has dark stains in it from cooking baked pasta in the pan (at 350 F - no crazy high temperatures or anything). Since that didn't affect its performance, it wasn't really an issue for me, but since I'm reviewing the pan, I figured that I would note it. Overall, for the price, I would certainly expect to get more than a year and a half's worth of use out of it, and I'm sure I could go through a return or warranty process, but it's still disappointing to have to do that."
5,Heavy Duty And Nice!,This pan was a surprise because it's made fron THICK aluminum. I was surprised by it's build quality. Wish it was Teflon coated but I'll take it as is.
1,Not durable,"After serving the family for 20 years, we needed to replace our two battered covered 13X9 pans. Tried this one and within 3 uses, it was pitted and developed at least 1 pin hole. Just cooked our usual stuff - bought another brand to replace this one and so far so good with the different brand."
5,Informative Yoga Book,I agree with the first reviewer. This book does need more drawings. This books gives information I haven't seen anywhere else. I have the author's book Yoga builds bones and have found it quite useful. Many yoga books try to sell you things. These books don't. I do wish there was a video. I have followed this book for 4 weeks and I can truly tell a difference.
4,Not the best,"Campion is a little too arrogant in the early stories. However, the twists and turns are all there. As always, every clue is hidden in plain sight, and you are left with questions never answered. Not the best, but very good nonetheless."
5,Allingham is tops!,"Margery Allingham wrote wonderful Brit mysteries....Albert Campion is her detective, but these stories are really about Britain in the first half of the twentieth century and about the ways in which information and meaning are communicated among people....funny, absorbing. The book arrived in excellent condition and on time."
1,A great way to boost productivity,Mr. Tracy forgot to mention the most important and effective way to really double your productivity. Stop wasting your time buying other people's books and tapes on how to double your productivity.
5,Incredible Book,"This was the second book I have read by Ms. Blackhawk and I was not disappointed. Her ""On Azraels Wings"" was a tremendous book (I have reread it about three times now) Warload Metal was written well and my attention never swayed. Please keep writing, I will buy everything. Bravo"
4,"Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll","This is a very deep love story. The two main characters are from very different backgrounds, but find balance in each other. Sonny, the intelligent younger sister of the manager of the band Warlord, realizes she is a lesbian as she falls in love with Torrin. Torrin, who comes from a world of sexual and drug abuse, uses and disposes of women like toilet paper. Sonny must convince Torrin she deserves to be loved.Do not read this book if you are sensitive to the darker side of society. However, if you enjoy a serious read this book is fabulous."
3,Heartbreaking to read. But very facinating.,Sad that children are treated so. Father should be shot!Very interesting psychotherapy and regression descriptions.Book was bought used and shipped quickly!
3,chiller tv series,I would like to know if this the series where the hand comes out of the ground in the beginning of every episode please write me back cause im very interested in this set. thank u.
5,America is too Young to Die,I think Leonard Ravenhill was one of the most prophetic writers of this century. This book is an excellent example of the writings of a Holyspirit filled man.
5,Beautiful Furniture,Melissa & Doug Doll-House furniture is superbly made with wonderful attention to detail. My little girl is going to be over the moon with her birthday present.
2,False Advertising,"This product looks like a new and updated version of Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. The CD label even has a copywrite date of 2004, and the Amazon available on date is also 2004. But the software is very old and outdated. It generally works with XP (except for the talking aspect) but does not have a good interface at all. Furthermore, when I looked at the last modified date on the CD itself, it said September of 1999. Basically the publisher made new boxes and labels for their old software and is still trying to sell it. If you don't mind old software this program is cheap and fairly comprehensive. Otherwise, look for another product."
4,Good Alaskan Mystery,"This book should be read on a cold and rainy night with a fire going in the fireplace, When I read it I had the air conditioner on full blast because it was 106 degrees outside. The beginning was especially good as Kate prepares for a long cold winter on her isolated Alaskan homestead. She then travels to Anchorage at the request of her grandmother. The politics of the tribal council was a little dull, but then the story picks up again toward the end. Ms. Stabenow is definitely worth reading. I'll be looking forward to future books from her"
3,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (precedent)","This 6th installment of the Kate Shugak series is fascinating for its glimpse into both Native American politics and the two-edged sword of development of Alaska's natural resources. Fleshing out the details of this content would have required a longer book and might have turned off more action-oriented readers; but I considered exploration of these topics a major strength. The downside of Kate's latest adventure is multiple forays into criminal activity; and not of the ""hero(ine) who can't wait for the rules in the heat of the action"" variety. This is systematic; and it comes off as childish personal malice. It is a sloppy way to wrap up the book's subplot (Jack's ongoing custody battle) and resolve the main plot; and it diminishes the stature of two popular characters. Three stars: good main plot and supporting content; bad guys/gals thwarted in their evil scheming; an ugly turn for law enforcement characters. I've come to expect more of Kate."
4,Blood will tell,I just like the Characters in theses books.Having a connection with Alaska and a bit of experience with native Americans it allows me to enjoyStabenow's writing
4,Brill...and they knew what they were doing,"Paul, the point is that for those who know and love the Apples for all they've done -- for all the territory they've covered -- they chose to do a pure powerpop album, because let's face it, that's what we want in our unguarded rock moments. And they built on the standout brilliant ""20 Cases Suggetsive of..."" of of Discovery of World. Two singularly important bands come to mind -- the Ramones and the Jesus and Mary Chain -- which (mostly the former) have given rise to a whole string of great bands that I know little about, like the Donnas and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The fantastic ""Yore Days"" reminds me of how much I'll be yelling for ""Touch the Water"" when the Apples roll in to DC. Hooray for the great American Apples."
5,Great guitar pop!,"I'd only heard one other Apples album and enjoyed the obsessive 60s-like approach of cool stuff like Brian Wilson and THE HOLLIES.Well,this album's quite different.The current mainstreem rock scene is into The Strokes,Vines,etc and The Apples seemingly follow suit,taking a stripped down guitar pop sound.I love this,though!Lots of hooks and tight melodies that will have you hitting the repeat on your cd player.This is great!"
1,rotten apples,"I love 60's garage rock as well as the White Stripes, but (try as they might) the Apples in Stereo just can't pull it off. Robert and Hilarie's voices are too bubbly, not enough snarl. And the fuzzed out production makes the record sound bland. ""Please"" might have been ok on it's own as a single, but a full album of similar tracks makes it all congeal together into a flavorless mush. The Apples in Stereo (a ""The"" band before it became marketable) should stick to Beatles-esque psych pop, or perhaps give gangsta rap a try."
1,Apples in Dookie,"Yikes, I liked the record before this one, Tone whatever. And the singles they put on the Spinart samplers were amazing. I used to think, these guys copped a lot from the Beatles but were actually pulling it off! An innovative sound that was both retro and modern.But this record blows. The cover looked StereoLab-esque so my hopes were high. However once I started to listen, I actually wondered if I had purchased a defective CD where a manufacturing error put some other band on it. The songs bite and the voices sound like an episode of the Simpsons where they let Bart sing!Unless you're a teeny bopper you won't appreciated their new harder ""let's sound like the strokes/hives/stripes"" attitude. It's not genuine enough in my opinion."
4,Very Well Done,"It's interesting reading the reviews of this CD. It may be a departure for The Apples In Stereo but as one who's only owned one of their previous efforts, I must say that I'm quite impressed. Velocity of Sound is just a fine rock and roll album, something that's all too rare today.The songs are short, feature loud guitars and all have wonderful hooks. Indeed, tunes like ""That's Something I Do"" and ""She's Telling Lies"" could even be described as pop punk. And it's terrific that they offer up an entire disc of same, rather than just a few cuts. Hey, if you're going to alienate a portion of your fan base, I can't think of a better way to do it than this! Here's hoping they keep it up."
1,Not the Apples I know,"After the Apples produced some of the best pop albums ever made (and they will long be my favorites) I feel that this album is a cop-out. It's getting some glowing reviews here, but after they produced a sugar-sweet single for 'The PowerPuff Girls' album, I feel they are reacting with this album with feedback and fuzz, as if to say ""Hey guys, you know we're still indie and raw."" Well we know you are, you don't have to slap us in the face with it. Every song sounds the same. Static. Fuzz. Feedback. Headaches. Where are the delicious pop melodies? Where are the contemplative lyrics that you can sing over and over? Where's the subtle nod to the 50's and 60's? Apples, you now sound like every snot-nose teenage garage band, and nothing stands out. I've heard this sound millions of times. Nothing special about this album. Please let this be a one-off."
4,"Great pictures, so-so text and captions!","For the police vehicle enthusiast, this book will be a real boon. The photos of police vehicles, literally hundreds of them, most in full colour, are magnificent. Most of the police cars shown are American, but there is a fair smattering from other countries as well. The photography is generally of a high standard, and the reproduction is exquisite. The text, however (what there is of it), is pretty generalistic. Then again, this is a PHOTO book. I did notice some of the captions, particularly in the model police car chapter, were totally inaccurate, as though written by someone who didn't know much about the models concerned. This compares with the chapter on old police cars, where the captions are highly detailed. Of particular interest is the range of unusual and spectacular police vehicles, such as the DARe cars (Corvettes, Camaros ... the works!). A great book photographically, that is pulled down from being a ten by some of the insipid captions."
4,Solid product,"It effectively reduces vibration and is incredibly easy to apply. The only problem I ran into with it is that it will occasionally pop off the racquet. This only happens when the ball makes direct contact with the dampener (which is my fault every time), but is still kind of annoying."
2,Boring Songs,"Songs are not catchy, as I was hoping for. Actually they are rather annoying and neither of my kids wanted to listen to this music."
3,There are many books with this title,"There are many books with this title. This one is just the most recently published. Before buying, check them all, especially the older editions edited by Western scholars."
3,Not what I expected,"This CD is not the same as the vinyl pressing of the late 70's or early 80's that had essentially the same playlist. I was hoping to replace my lost vinyl press of this title. This recording is somewhat rawer than the original and, frankly, I preferred the earlier version. One track, 'Champagne (& Wine)', appears exactly as I remember it on the earlier recording. I will say that the cruder presentation here is interesting, but if you are purchasing this as a replacement of the earlier recording, I fear that you will be disappointed."
4,Sweet chops and lyrics,"Have the album, decided to get the CD. The two are very similar but slightly different. Mostly in the intro's and some of the lyrics(not much). This CD stays very true to the album for sound and style. Great lyrics, jumpin piano riffs and excellent guitar chops."
5,one of the best records ever made in rock and roll!,"Herman Brood doesn't play rock and roll but he is rock and roll. If you like Graham Parker, Willy Deville, Lou Reed, just listen to Herman Brood. Herman Brood is not about technique in music but deals with emotion and intensity.You immediately feel the soul in his music. Just listen to one of his lyrics about his addiction to drugs: "" I can get along without you very well, cause I do. But when the lonely pain hits the brain, the leaves come down and so does the rain. My love for you, sweet mama"".Just enjoy it!"
4,the best yet in the smokey brandon series,"Although part of a series, this book works as a stand-alone, (although if you're planning to read the series, I recommend starting with A World the Color of Salt.) Smokey Brandon, one-time stripper and now an evidence tech for a California crime lab, faces her toughest challenge yet in The Juan Doe murders. A couple of new characters are introduced, including the adult son of Smokey's older divorced lover. This book is edgy and suspenseful, as are all of Noreen's books, but this one took a dark, unexpected twist at the end. As always, Noreen's writing is crisp and true. Fans of Kathy Reichs and Patricia Cornwell will enjoy her graphic detail."
5,Wow!!!,"This book is no longer in print so you need to buy it on the used market. If you are interested in tessellations at all you should definitely get it. This is so much better than any of the information I have found on the web. Jinny Beyer takes you step by step though the processes of designing your own tessellations and drawing figures within the tiles - demonstrating why birds and fishes make such good images for tessellations. She also walks you through some of the Escher tessellation drawings showing how he makes the images and tile shapes change gradually. (Very fun to follow). You can read straight through or wander through once you understand the basics. Beyer's quilts are fantastic - if you are a quilter or love quilts - you can enjoy this book solely from that perspective. But the way she combines art, design, geometry, craft, and imagination keep me intrigued whenever I pull it out."
1,Don't buy unless you have the base,They need to make it clear that the base is not included and that it is no longer available. Just a misleading waste of time and money.
2,"Not too good. Go ahead, though","As a Lenny Bruce fan, I know why someone should see it. Owning it, however, is a somewhat empty gesture. Most of the action consists of random b.s. film clips playing while a Bruce voice over plays. Like seeing random movie cowboys talk to a horse or a guy on a beach while listening to ""Religions, Inc.""? Then go for it. When the footage is of Bruce, it's worth seeing. It's too bad that sequences featuring Bruce are few, far between, and oftentimes too brief. I would rather have an unedited tape of whatever Lenny footage one could scrounge up, laid on a VHS tape than to own this. I own it, though, and am glad I do. It's the best that can be done. There are some bits on here that I haven't heard elsewhere, and it is nice to see Lenny Bruce in action. It's just too bad there aren't quality products on the market that can accomplish this. I wish they would make a Lenny Bruce best of tape that is somewhat sensical. This thing is more like a lame head-shop film."
5,Great Collection of Midnight Oil,Great collection of Midnight Oil's music videos from TV and live perfomances. Great sound and imagery make this a worthy buy for 'Oil fans.
5,Great Guide to Patagonia,This book is a great field guide to the area. The color plates are well drawn and are accurate. Very useful for identifying the species of this region.
4,Does the bounce music thing good but needs more street,"Choppa is a bounce rapper more then anything but this cd has some joints on there that will make the girls twurk something and get the clubs jumpin and things u can bump in ur ride...but when he does the street music he does his thing also ""represent yo block""with b gizzle and master p is off the chain ke'noe did the beat and ""bonus track number 1"" is banging with master p being hard on it and one of my fav people right now curren$y the hot spitta rippin that track up...curren$y is on 3 other tracks ""getting money"" ""shake it like that"" and ""holla at me"" all those tracks are hot...rest of the cd is iight but choppa did a decent job on this"
4,Not Juz Choppa Style,"Many ppl would think Choppa Style is the only good song on this album, its not, is the most premoted songs, and it isnt a good display of Choppa's talent. Other songs on this album r more close 2 a BG style. Hood. ""Choppa Style""is no doubt a club hit but Choppa raps about better stuff on the rest of the songs, so if you figure this is 1 of those CDs that you go 2 1 song and skip the rest,is not. You should try this instead of 500 Degreez, the rivalry between Cash Money and NO LIMIT has been going on, and i hav to say Cash Money has been better until BG and Juve left, No Limit is comming up."
1,no limit is dead,choppa has left no limit and master p's wack ass way behind but truth is choppa sucks and so does this cd.
4,"Not Great, But Far From Horrible","Honestly, I wasn't expecting much at all when I bought this album. I loved ""Choppa Style"", and bought the cd mainly so I could listen to that song. But I was shocked to find that it was actually a pretty good album. Yea, it is repetitive at times with similar beats and with him repeatedly yelling out his own name. But tracks 1-7 are all very solid, and while the album is weak from 8-15 (with Hatin' being an exception), Choppa comes backs trong with the final two bonues tracks. No, hes not a great lyricist, but hes much better than most of the other rappers that Master P seems to just run out there."
5,get it,"this is the 1st and last cd on the no limit label from choppa BUT I THINK THERE ARE 4 VERY GOOD SONGS AND THE REST OF THE CD IS ENTERTAINING.CHECK OUT 504 BOYS, KANE AND ABEL, SILKK THE SHOCKER +BG IF YOU LIKE THAT NEW ORLEANS SOUND-- WHO KILLED SOULJA SLIM - RIP. big ed + pimp daddy.free corey TRU"
4,They back,"Choppas album is clean, it's a stright party cd with acouple of thug songs like:brick jugle and the bonus track #1 with p. the only thing I didn't like was silkk was'nt on it or t-bo. but choppa is a hot rapper. no limit is slowly comming back (Oh Yeah)"
4,This Cd is Banging,I Think the Cd is tight because it has a lot of party songs off of it that people can dance off of it in the clubs and the beats are tight.
4,Hot,"This Cd is hot! No Limit is coming back! Choppa reps his block on this cd. Who does he resemble? Besides Currensy, Choppa is the best of the 504 boyz."
4,Listen to it a few times!,"old time No Limit fan(87-89),love new 504 boyz,didnt like choppa C.D. at first,listened to it a few times....HOOKED,dope beats,tons of drum machine and down south bass,fast pace,cant wait for New No Limit artists Curren$y,T -Bo,and the new Master P- C.D.havent been this excited about rap since first found No Limit......THE TANK IS BACK YA' HEARD ME,"
1,i havent bought the cd,"hey i havent bought the cd, cuz i heard his single ""choppa style"" and i think its one of the most wackest songs out there, how does no limit stay in business, u mean to tell me that people actually buy their cd's, and one more thing, Lil romeo stop being all up on tha videos kid, ur just a kid, so back in the sandbox."
2,Choppa Style,"The ablum is ok I was a Little disappointed because I thought it was gonna be better but the ablum is just ok it's got a few tracks that are tight but I only recommed this ablum for the tru No Limit fans,but the ablum is just ok it needs a little work I think."
1,"If I could, I would give this abortion of a cd 0 stars","This cd is a travesty. Apparently, this untalented blowhard feels he can cash in on hip hop's current wave of popularity with a disgusting, abortion of an album. I'd seriously rather listen to 7,777 screaming babies each scraping nails on a chalkboard for 77 days than have to listen to the cd in its entirety one more time. The lyrics are laughable. How can he expect anyone, anywhere, ever to take him seriously? If this debacle is any indication of where the rap industry is headed, I'd highly recommend switching to another genre...before you go deaf."
1,"Choppa needs to move ova,","Dis' Cd sucks. For a nigga from the nolia, choppa needs to move ova and let real nigga's get they shine on. If you like the N.O rap scene you need to check out; Chopper City Records(B gizzle's lable), Cash Money Records (Mannie, Wayne, Baby, Boo&Gotti), LAbratory Records (Turks), Cut-Throat Records (Soulja Slim), and of coarse cha' nigga juve. plus all the up coming nigga's like Ricky B, Ghetty Green, Tru, the list goes on...Stay away from the No limit Soulja's"
1,The Home Landscaper was a disappointment,"I purchase this book I wanted ideas and information on how to do my own landscaping. This book is a scheme, really that is all it is, a scheme to get me and anyone else who wants a how to do it yourself project book to buy they landscaping designs plans. This books show you layouts without details and then tell you where to purchase the plans. I needed do it yourself information and this book could not assist me at all, so don't buy this book if you are looking for do it yourself information because quite frankly there is no help between the [pages.]"
1,Very little help,As the others have posted this book only wants to show you that you can buy their plans for more detailed designs. Don't waste your money.
4,Great for Infants' room,"It is slightly loud at ts lowest setting, but it works great in my 16-month old son's room. The white noise it produces helps him stay asleep as well as keep the air moist in his room, since we live out in the middle of the Mojave Desert."
3,huh? what?,"Okay, this thing is loud. And suprisingly so, it looks like it should be so quiet. In all fairness, it does have three speeds, and when switched to low, is pretty quiet. However, it's only capable of humidifying, say, a closet at that speed."
4,"Capable, but noisy. Good capacity","I personally don't mind the noise, it relaxes me the way rain on the window does. My wife, however, is a bit annoyed by the sound of the fan. I like that it has a larger tank compared to other portable humidifiers. Of course that also means you need more strength to carry the full tank from the faucet back to the unit.FYI, I found that both Home Depot and Sears carry the replacement wicks. This is the second season that I'm using this humidifier and I expect to go through two wicks this year."
3,Can't find filters,My husband and I bought this humidifier a year ago and have been able to use it 2 out of the 12 months we have had it! To find a store that carries these filters is very frustrating!
2,Gross filters!,"OK - I like the feature that allows you to set how humid you want the room but I went into the room it was on in and noticed an interesting smell. I took it out and discovered a nasty mold covered filter filter. Granted, we should have known to check it earlier but we have only used it for a month on and off. I really wish there was some kind of warning (label, sensor or whatever) that would let you know to check the filter."
1,Hustled,"This company is a crapper outfit . lowball machine and then charge you 19.95 for filters etc .Save yourself , from buying crap . It worked fair . I have a vornado , works an the filters are easy to find .Honeywagon not honeywell ."
4,HP 4500 Drum Kit,"I was able to print over 12000 copies before changing drums. This included several thousand color copies. I did not get a drum low warning, theprinter went right to drum out. Once you go to drum out you can't print. It's a good idea to have a spare on hand. ..."
4,Solved streaking problem,"After a false start with a bait & switch by an Amazon Merchant (where they sent us a ""compatible"" Drum Kit instead of a genuine one), we ordered a true HP Drum Kit direct from Amazon.It got here sooner than expected AND it solved the streaking problem we've been fighting for a year now.The HP products are more expensive than ""compatible"" versions, but in this case, you get what you pay for. (When you take into account the free shipping, it wasn't that much more expensive than a compatible drum.)"
1,Too Small! Too pricey!,"Honestly, I thought the pad would be a little bit bigger...I guess it did the trick, but a little too pricey for the size."
1,Pu-lease!,"This book is one of the most boring and waste of money book KAA has ever wrote. I am a big animorph fan and I have every animorph book I could get my hands on. This is a bad display for my collection and with all due respect KAA, I think this book sucked. If you ask me, I would not want to have bought it if I had read a few chapters. KAA can do alot better."
2,It SUUUUUUUUUUUUUCKED!,The only good thing about this book is that your an animorph. The storyline stank. There's hardly any deatail at all. This is one of K.A.'s worst.
2,:::::sigh::::::: It wasn't THAT bad...,"Ok, i admit it. Even though I am the biggest Animorph fan, and K.A. is the best author in the world, but this book went nowhere fast. K.A., you can do better than this. It was short and didn't give you enough options. R.L. Stein wrties better Choose Your Owen Adventures than this, and he can't even write anywhere near as good as K.A. Now, K.A. has written many good books before this, and she has written many excellent books after. So all you hard-core Animorph fans out there, let's just put this one on our shelves so we can have the whole collection and forget about it. All in all, kind of disappointing, but doesn't ruien K.A.'s other fine work. Animorphs rule!"
1,I wouldn't suggest it,"I absolutly love the animorphs books, but this one wasn't nearly as good. Just for starters it could have been ALOT longer. And anyway, the oly thing you got to decide was your morphs. I think there should have been ALOOOOT more things to decide. Don't get me wrong though. The other Animorphs are great! (Especcialy 26, 32,3,and 13) <animorhs rock>"
3,Could be better.,"K.A. Appelgate is one of my most favorite writers around and her ""Animorphs"" series super, however, this book fell a bit below my expectations. There wasn't very many decisions to make and if you made a bad one you usually get killed in some way. I would suggest to K.A. not to expect all your readers to want to be the good guy--some I know would like to be a ""bad"" Animorph. It needs more choices, more plots and less details. Most of the readers probably already know what the Animorphs look like and such. I understand that this is only the first one you have written; maybe you need to get some help from an experienced ""Choose you own story"" writer (R.L. Stein of ""Goosebumps"" fame, and numurous other writers). This book is not bad for a first try, but it could be better. Good luck, try again."
1,Worthless,"This book is a waste of money. If I could, I'd give it zero stars. Resist the temptation to see what this book is like, even if you are a die hard animorph fan. There are tons of things that this book executes poorly, but the largest problem is that it's more like finding out if you are lucky at guessing correct awnsers than seeing if you are good enough to be an animorph. No book can tell you if you could be an animorph or not. Besides, how do you know if you would make a good animorph if they don't give you a rating or a score? Another major problem is that this book is WAY too short. I finished it in less than hour! It should be as long as a megamorphs book or the Andalite chronicles, or maybe even longer. And those are only a few of the many problems in this book. One example is you become a hyena to stop one of visser three's morphs. You do then suddenly, you're shot by some policeguard you neve knew existed."
1,don't bother,"Let me clear up one thing: KA didn't write either of the Alternamorphs. She did the least she could possibly do and still get her name on the cover. It could have been much better, but what makes Alternamorphs even worse is that it isn't really a choose-your-own-adventure. There is only one way to get to the ending; one wrong move and you're dead. You're better off just leaving this on the shelves and reading Animorphs for what it is."
5,I thought it was great! But not the best of animorphs.,This book could have been longer.I read it in 2 hours! The ending was werid. I couldn't really make sense of what was happening. But it was a good ending. I hope she writes more of these books. There are great. Keep writing K.A!
3,Ruins Animorphs' reputation,"In this book you get to choose what you want to morph, you choose to accept the morphing, all thoses you chose 'ems make a guy go insane. When Gooselumps got this a baught #1 and read it, the problem is that you can never read the whole thing, sure you try by reading the start then you the parts that you didn't read, but after the 5th time you gt sick of doing it. I dislike these typs of books, I sure hope Applegate can pull it together and make good, but untill I hear some good news on it I'll tell my friends not to get it. <Join Us>"
3,Well...it is o.k.........,"This book was nice, but kind of boring. The point is to pick the right morph and do not die."
5,COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This was so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sometimes in books u hate it because they do what you didn't want 2 now u can choose!!!!!!
3,Just O.K.,"This book is like a choose your own adventure version of animorphs. In my opinion, there could have been more choices.Also, I got eaten a lot in the book. One part was really confusing. I was in jaguar morph and Had no idea if I died or not.Anyway, I liked this book because I love all animorphs books. Buy only if you love animorphs. (like me!)"
1,SUCKS,I can not believe i bought this book. It was a complete waste of money. I tried to give it a -3 star rating but I guess it doesn't go that low
1,Not as well as I hoped it would be,"I'm sorry to say that this book was a dud. I guess everyone else is saying that and it's true. I was disappointed by how thin the book was! I expected it to be long like the Chronicles or at least the Megamorphs! It's smaller than the regular books! I like KAA and all I mean,she's a genius,but I think she could have stand to do better. Sorry:("
1,Buyer Beware,"Don't buy this book, it is a waste of money. You think they could do better that that. I read it in 15 minutes."
4,Alternamorphs:The First Journey,This is a pretty good book but unlike some chose your own adventures when you make a choice you die on the next few pages and it just tels you to go back to the base page and and try again (Unless you pick the right choice). Still its a must have for all animorh Fans. My recomendation is to not get to exited about it.
4,"fun PG entertainment, ha",I would rank this collection up there with BBC's Pride & Prejudice. I first rented this from the library and liked it so much that I purchased it off of Amazon.
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed watching this collection. I absolutely loved North and South and thought that Wives and Daughters was quite entertaining. The acting in all three of the movies was great as well. My only wish is that the Cranford episodes could have been less depressing. The only Cranford episode that seemed to have anything positive/good happen was the last one. I have to say that the Lark Rise to Candleford series is still my favorite, because it's stories contain romance, humor, and ups as well as downs and in the end you feel more uplifted than anything else."
4,A Fan,Started with North and South and this led to watching other movies from Elizabeth Gaskell's books.My daughter and I have enjoyed all of the shows and I have read a few of the books. Really likeprotrayals of life. The only thing that I didn't care for was there were a couple of spotswhere things were a little more graphic than needed in Cranford. Nothing improper just injuriesand old fashioned medical prodecures.
5,Fabulous Historical Pieces!,"These BBC dramas will NOT disappoint! In all three mini-series, the casting is excellent and the filming brings alive the worst and the best of the times with realistic regard. And for those fans of romance, there is some of this to boot!"
5,very great set of dvd's,"I bought this dvd which has Cranford, North and South, and Wives and daughters on it and thoroughly enjoyed watching them all. I would recommend this dvd set to anyone who enjoys those types of movies. Absolutely great."
5,Movies,These are some great movies. e= I have always wanted them. The acting is great and they follow the story line in the books. A definite must have in your library!
3,WARNING: Wives and Daughters NOT 16x9,"I bought this hoping to finally have a 16x9 version of Wives and Daughters. All of the technical specs I could find listed the DVDs as being in this aspect ratio. I was disappointed that the transfer of Wives and Daughters is exactly the same as is contained on the individual DVDs of the show. This means on my widescreen TV I get black bars around the whole picture. NOT the best for watching.I Haven't had time to watch the other movies yet, which ARE in 16x9 as the bottom of the package indicates. Too bad the BBC didn't give W&D; the update it deserves."
1,damaged & had to return,"looked fine on the outside, but plastic cd case was totally crushed on the bottom (sharp shards of plastic fell out & jabbed me when i removed it from the cover-ouch). luckily returns are not difficult with amazon. but now i will have to purchase this again somewhere (exchange wasn't an option for some reason) because i need my elizabeth gaskell fix ..."
5,The Definitive Resource on Pysanky,"PYSANKY IN THE 21st CENTURY by Helen Badulak is the first definitive book on Pysanky published that `has it all'... and then some! Oversized at 8""x11"", hardcover, 230 pages in full color on quality stock, the book covers everything from the history, tools of a master craftsman, everything you ever needed to know about eggs, techniques, instruction, and the inspiration that propelled Helen Badulac to become the master artisan that she is. It's not your run of the mill `how-to' book on pysanky... it is a personal journey and understanding of both the woman and her art, written with a generous and open heart.The text flows easily and naturally, the book is organized and complete in every aspect, and the photography and illustration flawless and abundant on every page. If you buy only one book on Pysanky, this is the one to buy and make part of your permanent collection."
3,Beginners be cautious,"This book is *NOT* for the beginner. The many beautiful eggs are photographed very poorly, and almost all pictures have issues with focus and glare. Also, the text is extremely self-indulgent (from the author's perspective) and unrealistically dogmatic. For the experienced pysanky artist and collector, however, this book is almost a ""must-have"" (even at its high price) because it can definitely expand your vision of where the medium can go beyond the traditional. Badulak's craftmanship is truly remarkable."
5,100% Satisfied,This book is a wonderful resource and I love it. Lots of beautiful pictures as well as plenty of written wisdom. Well worth the cost.
3,Force fed on glucose,"Ha! I remember this. Sounds great for the first three songs or so, but then the lack of fibre kicks in. Sweet, sugary, pleasant enough, but all the songs sound the same. They were a singles band really."
4,WOW!!!,"I've been following Niacin from the beginning. I have all their CD's. ORGANIK is - by far - the most adventursome of them all. The playing is ratcheted up considerably (which is really saying something when you consider THESE players!!!). Though this is not a CD that you would put on to enjoy with a quiet dinner, it is a great soundtrack for driving long distances on the highway. Just watch out for those speed traps. John, Billy and Dennis are all MONSTER players and this CD is a testament to that fact!"
5,love this album,billy sheehan is on this and so i had to hear it. niacin has several albums but i could only afford one.this is more jazz rock prog if that makes sense. brand x and pat methenny come to mind easy to listen to and great music!!!!thank you
2,Not good,"The problem with the other customer reviews here are that they are all by beginners who don't know any better. I ordered this book as a beginner and started to believe what the book was saying. Later, I searched for info about the book on the backgammon newsgroup. The overwhelming response from experts was that it is a horrible book for learning backgammon. Much of the info in the book SOUNDS like good advice, but is simply wrong. He makes the ""rollover"" rule that he introduces sound like a very common and accepted rule. That is just not the case. He also over-simplifies things and makes blanket statements that are only true some of the time. I would suggest finding a copy of Magirel's ""Backgammon"" instead."
3,Not so good,"I recieved my new hitch on time. Problem was the box was what I ordered but the hitch inside of the box was not. Someone had switched hitches to a non slider type. Also some of the parts were missing(rails). I called Amazon and was able to get a credit for recieving the wrong hitch. Being resorceful I was able to use what was sent to me by using the slide portion of my old hitch, everything woked out ok in the end and I got to go on vacation as planned. 5 stars to Amazon for my quick resolution of this problem and getting me my $285.00 credit (the difference between what I orderd and what I got). No stars for the person who swaped out hitches in the box prior to me receiving it."
3,Sadly Disappointing,"As with most reviewers, I have to start by saying that Tamora Pierce is one of my favorite authors. I love her. It was hard for me to accept that after a wonderful and engrossing book like ""Trickster's Choice"", the sequel would be so... blah. I kept waiting to be pulled into the story, to fall in love with Nawat, to otherwise become entangled with the story, but I really never was. For the record, Nawat is my favorite character in this book, but he only appears for a smattering of pages in it.To be honest, I'm glad I checked this one out from the library. I'll probably buy it eventually (for reference use in future books), but I'll buy in paperback."
4,A Cut Above the Average,"I really liked this, because the heroine is not the normal sort of adventurous girl who gets into scrapes. She plans and schemes and helps the good guys to win by manipulating the bad guys. She's really controlled and she always knows what she is doing. The only thing she can't control is falling in love, which is really sweet.I liked how the world was set, because the cultures were really unusual and different, and the 'culture clash' was great. The author did not write just another LotR-alike world.The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that there's not THAT much romance - it's all kind of secondary, and then the hero goes away, and then he comes back and that's that. And I didn't cry at the end like I did with 'Lioness Rampant', even though there were some sad bits in the final battle. But this is still a really, really good read, and I could not put it down."
5,A wonderful sequal!,"Ms. Pierce's enjoyable sequel to the Trickster's Choice is a wonderful read. It is in this book that Aly's skills come into full blossom. As the rebellion swings into full tilt Aly is at its heart, playing her part of an ancient prophecy as being the Cunning One. Taking part in a rebellion in the works for Centuries, Aly is at her best teaching the Raka how to use their resources and planning assaults on key targets, it is here her unusual education comes into play.This is a fun book to read for any age person. I started reading these books while looking for something for a young cousin who has gone onto buy the rest of these books for herself. This book is a real page turner, filled with battles, intrigues, humor and romance. I heartily recommend this book and the preceding book in the Aly series."
4,Where's the fun?,"Not to be too redundant, but I have to agree with the majority feeling about this book. It just didn't have the same ""umph"" of any previous stories by Pierce. Trickster's Queen seemed almost rushed to be done with and did not, as was also previously mentioned in reviews, have the same character or plot developement as some of the other quartets.Despite my mild disappointment I would still recommend this book on pure basis of being part of the Tortall series. Though not equal in quality of the other books, the Trickster books are fun to read and catch up on what the other characters in Tortall are up to."
5,Gripping adventure-political-fantasy-historical-romance novel,"As a Tamora Pierce fan, I am happy to say that I LOVED THIS BOOK! Aly is the perfect heroine: clever, resouceful, witty, and determined. She is ""the chosen one"" for Kyprioth, a trickster god, to put a raka queen on the throne of the Copper Isles. Will she succeed with glory? Or suffer a humiliating blow to the lower class? With just the right amount of wit, politics, and romance, Trickster's Queen is a must-read for all ages."
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","I loved this, but the first one was definitely much better. This is probably the least exciting of Tamora Pierce's books. (I'm not saying it isn't good, just the less so than the rest of her tales.) Pierce my favorite author. She works wonders with storylines."
3,"Please read this, though it is very long!!","You probably think that I am some big pessimist trying to put the author down, but I am not. I read Trickster's Choice, the one before it, and liked it. Than, i got this one. It dragged quite slowly and was a bit disappointing compared to her other fabulous series. The biggest problem with this second book is the main character. She knows everything! She knows when to do this, or when to keep her mouth shut, or when to act innocent. She has no flaws, which makes the book quite boring. Another reason why this book is not very good is because it drags on forever. There are no real big jumps that grip you, not once in the book. I am sorry to say that it was very dull.Please agree with me, no matter what the other people say. Or, at least read other series of Tamora Pierce, because this is not a big winner as you might think."
2,A sequel with flavor,"Tamora pierce's Triksters Queen is a memorable sequel , to say the least. Although i cannot honestly say that this was one of her best works. I can say that it is well suited to be the sequel to Trickster's Choice. If you have read Trickster's Choice you will remeber the forever watchful Aly, daughter of the lioness of tortall.In this book Aly fights to protect the ""twice royal"", a girl who is to be crowned queen of the raka. I must confess that I am uneasy about reavealing anything about this book because i believe that you should read it and discover the plot instead of someone telling you. If you are a devote fan of Mrs. Pierce's work then you should read this book. i do recomend it and i hope that you enjoy it."
5,a great sequel,This book is excellent and is enjoyable to all ages. Pierce uses old as well as new charactors to weave an excellent story. This is a very good book and will satisfy those waiting for a sequel to Tricksters choice
4,Nice sequel,"I really enjoy Tamora Pierce's work. I first discovered her by accident in a library, and I have been hooked ever since. This book is about par with her work. It's the second book in the series, the first being Trickster's Choice, which I would reccommend reading first.All of Tamora Pierce's books that I have read have strong female leads, magic, sword fighting, and are set way back when in an imaginary place. If you are into this sort of thing, then almost any Tamora Pierce books are worth reading."
5,Must own for anyone working with Oracle,Absolutely the best book I've ever read on any technical subject. The book is very easy to read and the examples are excellent and relevant to real world situations.
5,An outstanding read,While this book was written a few years ago the basic information in it is still outstanding. I was able to apply concepts taught in chapter 1 to my system with good results. Each chapter is packed with inside information on how the Oracle system really works.I highly recommend this book to all Oracle developers and DBAs.
5,Fabulous,"the book will teach basic Oracle things and clear the misconcepts, myths and mis understanding prevailing amongst numerous Oracle users.I am still to finish this book fully, but so far I am so enlightened by reading the first 3 topics of the book.I recommend to all who are related to Oracle Database to go through this book, which would be very very helpful in understanding the Oracle Database. Also, it would make Oracle a fun to work with instead of huge and cumbersome tool which is the picture in majority of people's mind."
3,Is this title list right ?,I searched by CDDB. It's list is here.Track Title1.South Beat2.Felicia3.Sunburst4.This Song is for You5.The Dreamer6.Amanecer7.The Land8.Beautiful Sadness9.Glasgow's Walts10.The Traveler
1,Huffy Calssic Trike,"DON'T BUY THIS TIRKE. I bought this trike for my two year old. The weld tacks broke lose as soon as he stated using it and as a result it is very woobley. It tips over and he has fallen of many time. I have since gone back and bought a Radio Flyer. Much, much better trike. No comparison. Don't waste your money on this trike."
5,memories,I grew up with these Christmas stories year after year. I now have children who can enjoy them too. Many of these shows are not on like it used to be. It is also great having them in one set.
3,"Nice collection, but some atrocious video quality","All in all this is a nice collection. The quality of Rudolph, Frosty and Santa Clause seem to be worthy of a DVD (and let's face it - the originals are all 30+ years old). However, The Little Drummer Boy appears to have been video-taped from a TV with an antenna on the roof. The quality is simply BAD. The frames are grainy, fuzzy and blurred, and the text frames are simply unreadable. I can't believe someone would actually have the brass to SELL this abomination - I wouldn't give it away, it's so bad.Don't get me wrong - overall the collection is very nice and brings back most of the Christmas TV specials we grew up with. It's just a shame that the producers didn't do a better job re-mastering the Drummer Boy."
2,Broken case,The case was broken when it got to me. Kinda bummed I have to deal with a loose DVD now.
4,"Quality not so great, but the memories are grand!","I grew up with these stories and they are harder and harder to find on TV each year. The quality of these disks are not that great, but the stories are still pretty cool."
5,Great classics for kids,This set is great for all ages. It is nice to see the classics without commercials. Big hit with everyone in the family!
5,Christmas classics are a hit!,"This video arrived quickly, and my kids and I love it. It even has ""The Little Drummer Boy"" which we haven't seen in years."
4,Works well with a slight modification.,"I bought this to use on a 2001 Honda Civic transmission. The only issue was that one of the clutches wass smaller, meaning the two arms couldn't move in close enough to compress the return spring. Just by grinding the welds down some, I got it to move closer and it worked fine.The only other issue was that the nut and washer wouldn't fit through the center splines. This meant I had to remove the nut and then thread it all the way down again. But for all of the other clutches on larger shafts, it fit through and worked perfectly.However, it would have helped if I put it in a vise, because it's hard to hold the tool and the clutch, and turn a wrench all at once.This tool does seem a little expensive, but I couldn't find a better price and it works well. And I could afford it, since Honda parts are cheap."
4,"A nice intro, brief and simple","This book is obviously an attempt on the part of the Reform movement to correct the misconception, common among Reform Jews, that there is supposedly no Jewish belief in an afterlife. The authors explore a variety of beliefs about life after death from different periods and branches of Judaism. I was pleasantly surprised to see a section on reincarnation, acknowledging that Hasidim and some others believe in it.All in all, although the book takes a more rationalist approach than I would prefer, it does give the average reader a nice introduction to Jewish afterlife doctrines. Best of all, it's short and very reader-friendly."
2,A just adequate account.,"There is little new here, just historical summaries of material that I mostly knew combined with a series of modern essays that are generally all of a piece, which can be summarized as ""if you think there's any kind of afterlife as traditionally envisioned, good luck!"" Admittedly, I was looking for a more optimistic take on an afterlife, but the overwhelming negativism here was pretty much of a downer."
5,This barrel is ausome,This is the best barrel ever it is a lot quiter than most barels and a lot more aqurate
3,Kindle version got a copyright issue?,"I rent this book on my Kindle this semester, but some pages are ""not available due to copyright restrictions"". Seriously? If there is a copyright issue, why would this book be able to rent on Kindle? It's not Google books that I read for free. I pay for it and still, some pages are not available?"
3,Where Was I???,"Due to time constraints, I am making this review very short.I enjoyed this video very much. However, something was missing and I haven't quite put my finger on it.What I want to know is... where the heck was I when Joe Strummer was on the streets handing out flyers to his shows? Good God! How cool is that?I practically had a heart attack watching Joe trying to get into a New Jersey radio station. Thank goodness he finally got in; that DJ would have regreted that later, hah?"
1,This is a fraud,"I bought this item with the expectations that it was going to be a good gift for my wife because she used to like this aroma a lot, but when i received it i took a broken box and the perfume was not as expected with the aroma, too bad for page so serious.Shame on you."
5,Inspiring - Motivating DVD,"This was such a great DVD! I really got a lot out of it. I saved a lot of money buying the DVD, as opposed to going to the live seminar. It was cool to see the audience interacting with Les Brown, I felt like I was right there. I stopped it a few times to take notes and consider what he was talking about, too. I recommend it.But hearing his story was incredible, Live Full & Die Empty is such a powerful philosophy... and it's so easy to relate to. He has some awesome stories about his past and what he's done to get to this stage in his life... you never feel like he's preaching or exaggerating at all. He genuinely wants to see everyone enjoy life and be as successful as he is - so great!"
4,I love Les Brown,"I love Les Brown. Perhaps I have seen too many Les Brown videos, so this video had a lot of the same material he has used in his other speeches. Les Brown has such great stories and examples to help me get motivated. He keeps you thinking about which direction your life is headed, and how to set goals and make a change."
2,not bad,i don't think that there is a great difference before and after using this product but all in all it is not bad
4,Good brand,"As all natural products you can not find a fast change, but I am very satisfied with the quality. I have also the green tea from this brand, and they are fast sending the products, and the prices are great.So if this product is effective, I still can't tell. I use it as a preventive since i'm pretty absent minded, so i guess I will be able to tell in the future!"
5,"Gripping, emotional...it's a surprise there's not many of","This book has it all, strong characters, love story, and background. It will not disappoint you. Fans of Chaim Eliav will enjoy this one! I can't put this book down. I devoured it in one setting!"
5,I Already Miss Him...,"This is quickly becoming my favorite album. I bought it the day before he died, and it is so haunting everytime I listen. His love, his sadness, his lament, is all there and bruisingly honest. I could only hope that I will have something like this album, something so hypnotic and beautiful, to be remembered as my last words. Buy it. Listen to it loud and alone at least once. It's like Johnny is right next to you. You could hand him a tissue, offer him some coffee, or pass a bottle around. Every song is perfect. Rest in peace, John."
4,It IS Johnny Cash after all,"You see, no one can rightfully write a bad review of any Johnny Cash recording (not counting his horrid ""The Junkie and Juicehead Minus Me). His voice is very weak sounding on most of the cuts. And on some of them you wonder if he is going to collapse from lack of breath. And then again you wonder why he thought we wanted him to record ""Desparado,"" Tear Stained Letter,"" and ""Streets of Larado."" But please remember, Johnny Cash, at his worst is 100 times better than any body else who has ever recorded or will ever record at their best.Go get this and enjoy it, It is after all Johnny Cash."
4,more like 3 1/2 stars....,"I love the sound of old guys laying it all on the line... this record's got that in spades.Great CD and a big improvement on American III: Solitary Man, which was only half a good record.Of course nothing compares to the first American Recordings for beauty and power.... Pick that up before you try this one."
4,Strong Offerings and The Other Stuff,"Being a Cash fan for about 1/4 of my life(I'm 16), I have praised Cash for his great songwriting and musicianship. But also, he has good taste in music; as is resembled on this collection.As the title of this review says, there are some strong songs in this collection: 'The Man Comes Around', 'Hurt'(I'm a Nine Inch Nails Fan), 'Personal Jesus', 'In My Life'. But some songs on this cd are sort of boring; 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry', 'Streets of Laredo'; then there are the OK songs; which is every other song.One review I have read that this selection is one of Cash's best; I wouldn't go that far. But if you want something that is better that 95% of what is on the radio and MTV/VH1/CMT/and every other music TV station; pick this one up."
2,grasping at straws,"A friend gave me this CD, raving about it. I really can't understand the hype attached to this album. The songs that aren't 'standards' are pretty good, though far from Cash's best, but the old chestnuts are almost unlistenable, for me at least. I'd have thought a dying man might find something new to squeeze out of Bridge Over Troubled Water, In My Life, Danny Boy, Desperado, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Streets of Laredo, something that would make these songs worth listening to for the nine-millionth time. Unfortunately he just sounds like an old man singing old chestnuts, they sound just as cliched as when any other artist performs these much-overplayed songwriting cliches.I do like the production very much so am giving one star for Rick Rubin and one for JC out of respect."
3,I thought it was a comedy record...,"Other than a wonderfully awesome rendition of ""Hurt,"" I think the rest of the album is a laugh a minute. I never laughed so hard in my life as when I heard ""Personal Jesus."" If Depeche Mode were dead, they would be rolling over in their collective grave! His voice quivers at times , and goes off key (usually flat)when you're least expecting it. I know a lot of people out there think Johnny Cash is the fourth member of the Holy Trinity, but offkey is offkey, regardless of how many years you've been turning out great product.In My Life and First Time Ever I Saw your Face are also real sidesplitters.I loaded this into my MP3 player for those moments I become depressed and need a good laugh. Worth buying for the comedic effect.This is not to say I have no respect for his achievements. It would have been better if he had stuck with the type of country music that he was so wonderful at interpreting."
2,Sad ending for a truly great artist,"You got to be a die-hard Johnny Cash fan in order to like this CD. Johhny gives it his all, but it's a sad ending to a wonderful career. Johnny's voice is shaky, and he can only hit notes at a very limited range. Many times he's off-key, and background singers have to carry the songs. Even with the help of great sound mixers, this CD is pathetic. All-in-all, if you rate this CD as a tribute to a great star and a great career and ignore it's flatness, you will obviously love it. If you want to buy it for Johnny's singing ability, forget it. This CD isn't for you."
5,One Hundred Million Angels Singing,"Rather than talk about the entire album, which is really great, I just want to remark about ""When the Man Comes Around"" In the liner notes he mentions he never spent more time writing a song than this one. It truly shows as this is arguably the most finely crafted ballad of his wonderful life. I have never heard or read a more intuitive and profound interpretation of the ""Book Of Revelations."" The theologians have always been mystified by this work, but the piece withstands any criticism. This is a genuine message being expressed through a worthy messenger and it's being expressed in a way that listeners can relate to. That's really what poets and troubadors do and maybe Mr.Cash was the last great troubadour of the 20th century; anyway, I'll miss his music and I'll miss his kind ways."
4,Damn Your Eyes,"This being the fourth collaboration with producer Rick Rubin, it's apparent that Cash is ready to go on his own. I don't think we needed covers of Simon & Garfunkel's ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"", Roberta Flack's ""First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"", The Beatles' ""In My Life"", ""Danny Boy"" or The Eagles' ""Desperado"". The best covers are Nine Inch Nails' ""Hurt"", Sting's ""I Hung My Head"" and Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus""--all of which seemed to suit Cash's voice and stylings. Also, the traditional ""Sam Hall"" is the perfect foil for Cash--more of this please! The title song, an original, shows that The Man In Black can hold his own, and, if he really wanted to, he could do an entire cd of all originals (which he SHOULD do). Maybe the next time out Rick Rubin could just produce an all Cash penned album?"
5,Buy it. Simple as that.,"I am not a Johnny Cash fan - but this album is simply astounding by any standard. There is so much emotion and honesty in the music that you cannot help but glue your ears to it. The songs touch that part of each us that is dark, afraid, and reflective. Make a cup of warm tea, grab an old photo album, and play this CD."
5,Amazing album by the Man in Black!!,"I came late to the camp of Johnny Cash. He caught my attention back with ""The Wanderer"" at the end of U2's Zooropa. And I knew he was something special. But youth is arrogant, and I passed him by, even when he did the first 3 great Amercian Recordings albums, one backed by Tom Petty. But I came to Johnny when I picked up a copy of Essential Johnny Cash, about a month ago, and I realized what true greatness was. I downloaded the video-clip to the song ""Hurt"" and I was shocked at how powerful it was-it brought tears to my eyes. Flash back to a couple of days ago, and I heard he died. It was tragedy. I went out and bought ""The Man Comes Around"" today-its the Cd of the year for me, maybe the one of the decade so far. I can't express how powerful it is. Every song is killer. If this was a final goodbye, my god, it leaves a lump in the throat. He was the Man in Black++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
5,The Man in Black,"Johnny Cash's last CD is an enormous testament the man's talent and vision. To the clearly uneducated fools who continue to disparage the man and his legacy, the so-called 'music fans' that are just slandering The Man's reputation here on Amazon.com: there is no way you can truly be a 'music fan' and not understand Cash's monumental stature in American music. You shame yourselves. Johnny Cash is irreplaceable; his voice, his honest understanding of the folkways and people of this land, ARE America. He will be sorely missed, and I guarantee that when I listen to 'Hurt' later today, I will be crying my eyes out."
3,Latest but not greatest,Have been a fan of Johnny Cash for many years and own most of his titles. However I am really disappointed in this one. It seems to be a rather endless dark dirge with little of the character of earlier efforts. I thought Water from the Wells of Home and American recordings some of his better later Cd's.
5,"Thanks for the great Tunes Johny, Rest in Peace",If you like Johny Cash you will love this last offering. WHen he does a cover song her truly makes it his own. This album is definetly a great last offering from a talented Artist. Highly Recomend it.
5,review of a review,"I have heard and loved the music of Johnny Cash all my life , this was my father's greatest gift to me. I consider my self a bit of an expert on the Man In Black. But I could never relate to other people the haunting beauty and powerful soul Of Cash's voice and music as did : Bram Janssen (The Netherlands) . His review touched me. This is what Cash's music truly was meant for."
4,"Johnny Cash ""The Man Comes Around""","Okay, first of all, this is Johnny Cash, and that name alone scores big points. One of the coolest things about this album is it lives and breathes with Johnny, it gives us a glimpse of his pain and age, and I think the solemn attitude of the entire record gave us all an empty feeling, one that signals the end of an era. Surely enough, not long after this album's release and the death of his wife, the man in black left us, and I like to listen to this album and think of it as Johnny writing us all into his will. His vocals are much deeper and sound much wiser. I personally think it's one of the best vocal performances of his career. The music on the record is a collection of covers and new songs that Johnny claims he spent countless hours writing. After hearing them, you will believe it.Standout Tracks: I Hung My Head, The Man Comes Around, Hurt, Sam Hall, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
5,"Ominous, from start to finish.","I've been a Cash fan since I was a child back in the early '60s. The honesty and integrity he has always tried to bring to his music is something reserved for only the greatest minstrels and troubadors, and Johnny Cash is one of them! Like Ray Charles he's always had the ability to make any song sound as if it was his alone. Being the stylist he's been since 1955 it's not surprising. Now, as he's entered the twilight of a spectacular life and historic career, there's something unsettling about the songs performed here (Has any rendition of Danny Boy ever sounded more sadly honest?) If Mr. Cash never decides to ever record another album for the rest of his life this one will serve his fans well if he decides it's his last. Hopefully it won't as Johnny Cash is a true American musical treasure."
4,Johnny Having Fun,This was a pleasant surprise. Cash picked songs with lyrics that mirror his and made them his own.
3,"A couple songs are cash, the rest are food stamps","This disc is worth the price of purchase for the first two tracks alone - When The Man Comes Around and Hurt - if you don't already have them.After that, however, there is a sharp dropoff. The production by Rick Rubin is top-notch, providing a solid yet spare backing for Cash's inimitable style, especially on songs like ""I Hung My Head"" and ""Personal Jesus.""If you're a Cash diehard, it's a must-have. If you're a Cash fan, it's a should-have. If you're new to the Cash experience, there are better places to start. It's good, but not great; certainly not the caliber of American V."
3,one album too far,I love Johnny Cash but he never should have made this album all it does is make you sad for what he used to be. I gave it three stars just because its Johnny and no one could touch him in his prime.
5,"A masterpiece, plain & simple.","I can't give this CD any more praise than has already been given by others. The selections are thoughtful, the delivery poignant and powerful. Mr Cash was at the peak of his form right up til the very end.I feel compelled to address the small people who've marred this forum with libel instead of objective opinion. Grow up. And get your facts straight. ""40 years ago he would have been blacklisted""? Seems to me that 40 years ago he was much wilder than he is now, but I don't recall ever hearing about him being banned from the airwaves or public appearance. And my IQ? It's 165. What's yours?"
4,very good,"I want to mention Danny Boy. When I heard it I wept. hard to believe anyone could revisit that song and nail it. Some songs feel as thought they were picked for the irony of Johnny Cash sing them and they don't quite work. Personal Jesus espesially. one can see how truly weak a song it is. Even in Johnny's formiable hands it's still just a riff and half an idea for a hook that never finds its voice. ""Hurt"" is brilliant and ""The Man Comes Around"" may be the finest Johnny Cash song ever. I wish that he had done ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" on Unchained when his voice was stronger. It's rambling melody doesn't work for Johnny's voice. Message to Rick Rubin! Edit Fiona Apple's insipid ""harmony"" on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""! Get this record for ""Danny Boy"". I'm made breathless every time I hear it."
5,vinyl version has two songs omitted from cd,"This is the fourth of the American releases.Mike Campbell,Ben Tench,Smokey Hormel and Roger Manning of Beck fame,aswell as Randy Scruggs are the main backing musicians.Guest include Laura Cash,Billy Preston,Nick Cave,Don HenleyFiona Apple amongst others.These(songs) are really powerfulgivin the ""Cash"" treatment.He's got such an uncanny abilityto make them his own,and there's a power in his voice and delivery that hasn't wavered in my opinion.Standout songs include,The man comes around,hurt,bridge over...,Sam Hall,Tear stained letter,we'll meet again.LP""S HAVE THE EXCELLANT SONGS Wichita LIneman W/guitar solo byGlen Campbell, AND A MARTY ROBBINS SONG-""BIG IRON"""
5,Cash on Death,"The man faces his mortality. Johnny Cash addresses life, sorrow, redemption, and death in these recordings. Somehow he does it in a more compelling fashion than any other album I've ever listened to. Death is the destiny of all of us; it inspires fear, dread, sadness, and somtimes, hope. It is ugly, doesn't discriminate, and is as certain as birth. When Mr. Cash sings about it, death's reality is palpable, its finality seems even more permanent. Yet, at the same time a thread of hope is glimpsed along the way. The Man's faith in Jesus Christ adds mystery and even a bit of anticiption? This disc makes me think, and it makes me feel even more."
5,Thank you Mr. Cash!!,"Wonderful and powerful album. I saw the video for ""Hurt"" before I bought the cd (which contains the video). It is quite possibly one of the most moving pieces of art that I have seen. In 4 1/2 minutes, you span the career of a legend, which includes his greatest triumphs and his deepest ""hurts"". Many thanks to Reznor for writing the song and the director who captures the beauty of a life spent bringing unique satisfaction to the fans. You will be missed, but you left your gift behind....and music such as this, like you Mr. Cash, only gets better with age. Thanks again."
4,"Rest in peace, Mr. Cash","Very little ever touches me, but I must agree for a variety of reasons that Hurt is an incredible cover, and I believe it the finest music video ever made. I was shocked to hear of his death today, given that he left the hospital only the other day. As my tastes lean more toward techno and ambient, and considering the fact I never wrote a review for anything on Amazon before this, it should speak volumes that I put in my two cents to the unitiated..."
5,"Johnny Cash: The Man, The Myth, The Legend",I cannot believe it but he has mastered yet another album. Not only is each song great but it is assembled in a way that really makes the entire CD an experience. From beginning to end I was unable to press stop. It is a must buy. It has classical Johnny and then some new stuff that really shows his versatility. Buy it now!
4,One of his best.,"The truth is, all 4 of his ""American Recordings"" are great, and though ""Unchained"" is my favorite, this is excellent too. It's definitely the album with the most well known covers, which are just as impressive as his originals. Included is the wonderful ""The Man Comes Around"", ""Personal Jesus"", ""Danny Boy"", and the popular ""Hurt"". However they're mostly all superb, with only a couple that are fair. I think after a few listens of this album, or any of his releases, you'll understand why he's not just a country music icon, but an american icon."
5,Very good,"If you can find it, get the vinyl version. It sounds better, and includes two additional songs--""Whichita Lineman"" and ""Big Iron.""My favorites song on it is ""Sam Hall"""
4,Last Testament.,"His voice is weathered but the overall effect is quite good. The cover of the Trent Reznor song, ""Hurt,"" is surprising in its complexity and beauty. I would never have expected Johnny to sing that song so hauntingly which is in keeping with the theme of the free video DVD which is attached. ""Danny Boy"" is strong but the title track is superlative. His short interpretation of the biblical passage of the white rider bringing death is fantastic. I was not prepared for the way in which in this CD grew on me."
5,The man in black,"Put the cd on your cd-player, sit down, relax and listen to!Atmosphere is mighty!, especially ""Hurt"".Merely ""Hurt"" is good reason to buy this cd.All other songs are very fine too.Booklet is ok."
5,Great book.,"Mr. White describes his experiences with training a goshawk for falconry. He has no guidance beyond an ancient manuscript and things go horribly awry. An outstanding book, a pleasure to read. Also an example of why current US regulations require a falconry apprenticeship period."
4,Great in Italian but English songs are really terrible,"One great thing about a CD with lots of selections is that you can easily ignore the songs you don't like. You simply program them out. With LPs that was a problem. On this budget CD, Jose Carreras sings opera arias, operetta arias, Italian songs and some English songs from Broadway shows. Three out of four is not bad. Everything is fine except the English songs, especially the title song, Memories. This song and all the other Broadway hits are simply terrible. His diction is bad and he totally forgets that he is not singing opera. The heaviness in those songs is very hard to listen to. The CD is well worth the budget price but you may find yourself using your program function."
3,ok,it is ok but nothing great here it is kind of a slow read but if your into iron man read it but nothing amazing
1,Item is defective out of box,"Bought the item arrived fine, tried to charge the unit didn't work. This is what happens when you buy Made in China crap, you waste your time and effort. I would stay away from this Brand Totally, simply waste of time."
4,Never Fails!,I purchased this product on Amazon over a year ago and it never fails to work and charge my battery properly and quickly. I only wish the cables were longer so that I could rest the charger on the ground while the battery recharges even for just a few minutes. The work light also comes in very handy. The charger can also power up other smaller items as well. Good product overall.
4,One Big Fan,"This is One Big Fan. It's not exactly quiet, but I can't really tell if it's because the machinery is noisy or if it's the noise of roomfuls of air being moved around every few seconds. If you are looking for a quiet bedroom fan to put on ""low"", this isn't it. Even at low it moves more air than just about any table fan on high. At high, you probably don't want it in the same room as you, at least if you need to sleep. However, if you are looking for a fan to cool off the whole house/loft/warehouse, or don't mind the off-white noise in your bedroom, this is the fan for you."
4,True Professional,"Jeff was the drummer's drummer and this CD is a nice tribute. Well done but not spectacular. Jeff's talents for the groove are special and his song credits bear that true. The musical world certainly misses this ultimate professional, and this CD is a nice gesture. I have the US version (about $18)."
2,Disappointed in the films,"First, the idea of putting four pictures in one package like this has a lot of merit. It is a great way to add to your library without spending a lot of dollars.My wife and I were disappointed in all the films in this collection and as such, would have rated them somewhere between one and two stars for each. They simply did not engage our interest, especially consider the quality of the performers."
2,Poor typesetting,"This SoHo Books version has absolutely abhorrent typesetting decisions with headings that are out of order as well as text fonts that are far too small which makes the book almost unreadable.Producing Open Source Software: How to Run a Successful Free Software Projectis the original version and whilst I don't have a copy, if you're going to get a copy of this book, I would recommend it over this horribly typeset and put together version."
1,Why ghost Children?,"I read the first three babysitters.The first one was really spooky and the other two where ok i guess. So when i saw this one i thought it would be cool.But it was really bad,i mean r.l.stine just ran out of real murderers so he had to invent some wierd ghost kids.I hope he doesn't write the babysitter 5 because what murderer is he going to make up next?!"
2,OK,"I read the first one and it was spooky! So then I checked out this from the school library and thought it would be great! But it wasn't really. I mean, I expected another killer, but just got ghost children instead."
3,Pretty good tank,Its a pretty decent entry level size tankfor paintball.. its a bit on the heavy side andif you want something to fit on your gun gowith a carbon fiber 4500 psi unit. more pressureand less weight.
1,dissapointed reader,"This book is a waste of your money, the pictures are average, you can find the same quality in any scuba magazine at a lower cost. There are better books on the subject out there. The writing is amateur in nature and the instructional content very weak, Instead, I would recommend books by Jim Church or Howard Hall, they are of a more professional style and overall finish."
3,Only Average,Stephen Frink's book Wonders of the Reef: Diving with a Camera struggles with what kind of book it should be: coffee table photo book or UW instructional book. As a result it is not particularly great at either one. There are great photos in here. But it's not really a coffee table book. The photo instruction is very basic almost as if he's afraid to give too much away.
4,good,i never give a 5 or a one because things can always be better and worse. it does the job it is supposed to do.
1,does not fit,"The number on the phone matched the LG model on the charger exactly, but the charger does not fit the phone."
1,Not an LG brand charger at all!!!!!!!!!!!,You may want to reconsider ordering this one. Its not an LG brand charger and it dosen't even fit for the VX8300 phone. Shipping cost was over $5.00and its not even as advertised. Not happy at all with Bargin Cell product. Its a waste of money.
1,Disapointed,I thought I was buying a REAL Verizon LG charger. What I got was something that belongs in a dollar store. It works but but you have to keep playing with the cigarette lighter plug to keep it powered up. Stay away from this one.
1,Car Charger,Car charger did not fit for LG 8300. The neck was not long enough to fit into the cigarette lighter. Please advise return details/process. Thank you.
5,Must Read!!,"Once you pick up this book, you will not stop until you finish! It will make you take a much closer look at the education system today and how some things have changed and how some have not. You will feel all the things that Theron went through because of the way Earl presents this story. Earl did a wonderful job and I feel it is a must read for all."
1,ok music...horrible attitude,"I saw Modern Life Is War for the first time and I must say that their music is ok, but their attitude is horrible.During their 30 min set they threw multiple beer cans at fans...even the ladies, they spit on fans, they told viewers to jerk-off to the bible, they called viewers c@ck S@ckers, they came out into the crowd and threw cell phones on the ground, they threated to fight people multiple times, and after their performace they went on a drunken ""lets throw our demos as hard as we can into people's back"" rage.Not to mention this was all done at a Christian music tour - Tooth and Nail with He is Legend and Maylene and the Sons of Disaster.Im all about giving a band a chance, but these guys are a-holes. they demand respect without earning it or giving it. Their music was ok and I might have actually bought a cd if they didnt act the way they did. I have never in my life seen so many people wanting to jump on stage and fight a band."
4,Another Great Invicta Value,"I have been collecting Invicta watches for the past two years and have 55 at last count. This particular model is at the low end of the Invicta line, but is still is a very nice timepiece. The hands are very easy to read and the ""brass"" colored numbers stand out very well against the black background. I was a bit disappointed with the band as it is very stiff. Maybe it would loosen up after getting broken in, but I had a nice black ostrich band in the drawer that I switched out. I also own the blue and pink mother-of-pearl versions of this same watch and they are lovely. When you compare these Invictas to other watches at the same price point, these look/feel like real bargains."
5,biological warfare thrills & spills,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends PLAGUE MAKER as the latest multi-layed thriller from the ""Insect Author"" Tim Downs.An FBI counterterrorism agent is contacted by an aging Chinese man with a story too terrible to ignore, of unspeakable tragedies & unthinkable evil, & old men with long memories.PLAGUE MAKER is a first class hair-raiser about dead fleas & very live rats & what they carry, fake antique relics & camouflaged old ships, murdered men & WWII survivors, hostage negotiators & terrorist plots, young workaholics with broken hearts & stifled souls, as well as some fascinating history about biological warfare, all superbly mixed with heart-pounding action & delightful dashes of humor.PLAGUE MAKER is also about revenge & forgiveness, & how different cultures tell their stories."
4,Entertaining,"Very good mystery/hunt the terrorists with interesting characters that were well developed. Fairly standard terrorist plot with an interesting connection back to WWII and more focus on personalities and the tracking process than fast action sequences but I found it fascinating.One criticism for me was that the author describes a scene in which a rural resident who is being interviewed kills a chicken and cooks it for dinner for the main characters. As someone who has done this a number of times, my suggestion would be that the author take the time to contact someone who has actually done this. Believe me, isn't going to happen the way it's described.I had some reservations about a book by a 'Christian author' as I usually find that the entertainment value/story gets lost in the message but that was handled with a reasonably light touch here.Would definitely try another by this author as this worked well for me."
5,FABULOUS,"This is my first book by Tim Downs, but it won't be my last. PLAGUE MAKER was a fabulous read! Totally engrossing, interesting detail into bioterrorism and a wonderfully flawed hero and heroine. Even the secondary characters were fully developed and almost stole the show. I expected a great thriller, but got so much more with the way he superbly wove in the theme of the importance of forgiveness."
3,"Fabulous premise, mediocre execution","The best thing about The Plague Maker is its premise. The worst thing is its execution.The premise: A terrorist plot to attack the United States with bubonic plague is discovered. Anyone who knows me long enough knows I'm a sucker for anything to do with plague. I'm just morbid that way. This means it's a foregone conclusion I'll pick up any book, whether fiction or non-fiction, that deals with that particular disease. (I'm the same way with Jack the Ripper, but that's another story.)So, ah, execution: standard issue stock characters speaking standard issue stock dialogue, racial and sociological stereotypes galore, with just enough science in the creation of the plague and its intended method of infection and just enough intrigue in the back story of the terrorist and his pursuer to keep me interested. Barely. Hardly the best thriller I've ever read, but serviceable enough to while away a few hours on a Saturday afternoon."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"This is the first book that I have read by Tim Downs and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It has action, suspense, humor, wit and emotion. A great combo to me!One thing that I particularly enjoyed was Mr. Downs ability to tell the story and not resort to sex and cursing. I am no prude and I know how to skim past stuff that is offensive to me, however, I did find it refreshing to not have to worry about it.Overall a very fun and engaging read! Check it out!"
3,"Oh, is that what Christian Fiction is","The first Tim Downs book I read was Head Game and it's an interesting read, different, and holds together pretty well throughout the entire book. I had seen somewhere that Downs was a ""Christian Fiction"" author, but it wasn't readily apparent in Head Game. So I went on to read Plague Maker, and I think I know what CF is now. It's the gospel retold as an action thriller, and not bad if you are into the gospel, but weird if you were just expecting a good thriller. The book is well written and researched and quite fascinating--U731 is all historically real. Downs weaves a plot worthy of Crichton, but it gets interlaced with Christian messages. The action suffers as a result, but if you are looking for a modern way to access the gospel, this is the way to go."
3,Barska Blueline 3x25 Opera Glass w/ Light,"Recently I used my new opera glasses. I have season tickets to performances in a med-lrg auditorium. The sight range was ok, but I couldn't get the light to work. Beforehand I should have checked the range and turned around the batteries. The instructions were not as clear as they needed to be. Given the tightness of the adjusting rings, it was hard to find the right fit and clarity. Next time I use them, things should be much better. Overall satisfaction--fair."
2,Opera Glasses,A bit disappointing. The images are not as close as expected andthere is no possibility for improving the view.
2,Not a binnocular,"There's no focus adjustment, therefore not as sharp as a binnocular. You will be disappointed if you expect the sharpness of a binnocular. The light is only good for reading your program sheet only, it will not reach anything further than 5 feet."
5,CLARIFYING COMMUNICATION THEORIES: A Hands-On Approach,"This is a highly useful textbook and reference that lives up to its name. In a field where gobbldygook, buzzwords and obfuscation are all too common, this book helps students (and their instructors) clarifies the range of contemporary communications theories in an easy-to-understand and easy-to-implement fashion."
2,Too simplified summaries on too many topics,"This book summaries communication theories in both human communication and mass communication areas. It's a nice job but it is a kind of lecture note for undergraduate students or for graduate students who want to review theories for midterm or final exam. If you are an instructer, this book is not a bad choice, because your student will have a good summary-version of theories."
4,Old book in Very Good Condition,"The book I wanted was really out dated but with a very good exercise program in it. I was doubtful that I could even get the desired book and if so it would be in poor condition to say the least. I was delighted when I received the book and it was complete, able to read, and the only way you could tell it was outdated, the book had yellowed. Thanks for the help."
4,Sturdy cable for a great price!,Pro Co SEG-10 Guitar / Instrument Cable 10 ft.Went through countless cable before ordering this one due to shorts or them just going out. At first thought this cable would be the same due to the price but I was wrong. The cable is heavy duty and very well made.The jacks are easy to repair and cleaning is really easy and for me the length is a big plus.This cable is longer than most of my previous ones and makes getting around easier.A well made cable with a low price an unbeatable combination.I recommend anyone looking for a guitar cable to choose this one.
4,Got me going...,"I loved this book - though the trashy cover doesn't match the story at all. There is a lot of sex in this book, it is full on, with not much plot imbetween. But the sex is really hot (for women). Especially the way the lead character (Holly) is shared between the father and son where she is staying. She does have an improbable amount of sex, but that's the point isn't it? And her eventual love interest is pretty sexy in the Mr Darcy tradition...One for the girls."
2,Great Comparative Commentary,"The strength of this commentary comes in its continual comparing of Matthew with the other Gospels. Gundry goes verse by verse through Matthew and shows the continuity of language from the other Gospels as well as the uniqueness of Matthew's vocabulary. Yet Gundry spends the vast majority of his time in this type of comparative work and therefore spends much less time than other commentaries on the actual exegesis of each passage. Therefore, this commentary would be recommended for those doing comparative Gospel studies but most would be better served by Bruner, Carson or Morris in order to understand Matthew's purpose, meaning and theology."
4,Helps with allergies,"I have been very happy with my Honeywell air cleaner. We purchased it after we turned on our central heater for the first time in the winter and were experiencing allergies with dust. It also helps relieve my husband's pet allergies. It indicates when the filters need to be changed, which is very handy."
1,Just didnt work,"I bought the air cleaner, plugged it in and it worked for about a week then just stopped working, motor didn't work, no activity of any kind. I returned it and had it replaced and had the exact same problem, but this time it stopped working after one day. Called the Honeywell customer support line and all they could tell me was that sometimes the units sit on the shelf and the motor collects dust and this might cause it to burn out. I agree that the motor probably burned out on both units but this explanation made no sense at all. I didn't want to pursue it with them, I just returned the second unit and am looking for a different air cleaner. Might have just been very unlucky but it is a very odd coincidence. Amazon of course was very responsive and helpful."
2,Bought two - both defective...,"I ordered one of these a few months ago, and after running it on ""high"" for 2 hours the fan stopped. The cleaner worked on medium & low settings after that, but would not run on high. I called the company; they said it was a defect. Amazon.com sent a replacement; the replacement ran for only 5 minutes on ""high"" before giving up the ghost. The medium and low settings are great, effective and quiet - but not being able to use the high setting is ridiculous, and 2 defective cleaners in a row seems like a pretty bad track record. This happened in the past 2 months; maybe it was a defective batch from the factory, since earlier reviewers don't seem to have had this problem. Anyway, food for thought."
1,Terrible quality control at Honeywell,"I researched a dozen HEPA filters and decided upon this product based on price and functionality. I purchased 2 units - one for upstairs and one downstairs. One unit worked fine and is still working 2 weeks later. The other unit turned on for 5 minutes and then died. The manual said to return it if it didn't work. I returned the item for a replacement (hassle enough) and when I plugged in the replacement (different electrical outlet nonetheless), the new unit ran for 5 minutes and then died. Exactly the same problem as the first unit.Obviously Honeywell has poor quality control for these units. A single bad unit may be acceptable, but 2 in a row is more than coincidence. Not only will I not replace this second unit, but I will not shop for any other Honeywell products in the future.If you like hassle and disappointment, buy this item. However, if you expect a quality product for your money, stay away from this unit."
3,Straightforward,"This album is pretty up front - lots of breakdowns and riffage going on, even some singing at points. What really makes this album sound like its own is the production - it sounds rather raw, but everything comes in crystal clear, giving it this warm, analogish sound. The music is breakdown-happy, with lots of downtuned riffs and even some singing to boot. The only problems with this record are that most of the songs sort of just blend together...allowing each song to lose some of its ""identity"" if you will. Also, some of the breakdowns are very bland - that simple chug chug chug is great sometimes, but it doesn't need to be in every song. However, that doesn't mean it's totally generic - this is a strong release by a great band who I very much want to see in a live setting in the near future. Top songs include ""Suffer"", ""Pushing Up Daisies"", ""More Than Life"", and the re-recorded ""I Do My Crosswords in Pen""."
1,Craptacular CD Of The Year,"This cd is by far the worst piece of crap ever. Whatever the guys in this band are trying to be macho-core, our metal-core, our hardcore, doesn't matter because they suck.The singer has a horrible voice to begin with and then he tries to sing with death metal type growl, which is terrible, coming from him. Then their are a few clean choruses that suck as well. This cd is nothing more than a long breakdown (letdown). The musicians obviously seen a music video or heard something and thought they could play as well. Any worthwhile bands obviously have not influenced the musicians in this band nor have they taken any much-needed lessons to learn how to play there instruments. How and why is such crap like this produced and released onto the public?TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND:PLEASE DO NOT RELEASE ANOTHER ALBUM.YOU GUYS TRULY SUCK AND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF MAKING SUCH A CRAPTACULAR ALBUM."
2,cuts well but cuts crooked,"This knife cuts well except for the fact that the blade doesn't seem to stay straight when you cut with it. This is especially noticeable when you are cutting something hard like a carrot. Instead of the blade cutting straight down it cuts at an angle. I actually wound up cutting my figure because of it. I returned the first knife, thinking that I had just gotten a knife with a crooked blade. However, the replacement is doing the same thing."
3,Like Adding Sugar and Honey to Syrup,"This disc largely consists of sticky-sweet, bastardized choral arrangements done in a saccharine style. The pieces whose texts are set to familiar ""Top 40"" classical works are really quite tasteless- Lugebat David and Crux Fidelis being the worst of them.The recording has been made with a manufactured sound in an unusually resonant space, which has allowed the producer to gloss over a startling number of sloppy entrances, a poor blend, occasional pitch problems, and a shrill soprano section.Borrow the disc from your library and listen to the transcriptions for the novelty of it- but for more legitimate recordings of the Rutter, the Messaien, Part and Rachmaninov, you'd best look elsewhere."
3,Good choir but not best choice of music,"This is my first and, as yet, only recording of the Choir of New College Oxford, and I must say I am not wholly enamored with it. The choir makes a lovely sound and the quality is good, but I just cannot bring myself to enjoy the choice of music itself. I have listened through several times and only a handful of pieces capture my fancy - the Rachmaninov, Tavener, and Rossini, in particular - with the rest of the music simply too romantic and ""ordinary"" for me. To be blunt, I find the program rather boring. As for the singing, it is mostly beautiful but perhaps a little ""too much"" for lengthy listening - the vibrato is, for me, slightly overdone in places and the trebles sound a bit shrill and/or flat on occasion. However, I am certainly not going to argue that the quality of this ensemble is anything less than first-class; I would just prefer to hear then performing what to my taste would be a more interesting program."
4,Sexy Ants,"There is lot of good energy and beautiful music on this double live album, including the 30 minutes ""Oasis"". Recorded at the Village Vanguard in New York in 1979. Jarrett is accompanied by his European Quartet; Jan Garbarek on Soprano and Tenor, Palle Daniellsson on Bass and Jon Christensen on Drums. Jarrett dominates most of the music, but Garbarek's unique floating tone and the subtle accompaniment of the rest of the band is sure noteworthy.A live album very much worth buying; Highly recommended for all Jarrett's fan; however if you are new to KJ's music, start with ""The Koln Concert"" instead.Another well recommended studio album For Jarrett with his European Quartet would surely be ""My Song""."
2,"ok. but voicing by keith to piano as he plays, stinks!",not worth the purchase price - voicing kills set for me! This destroys listening pleasure )-: .................:
4,Paper Lion,"The book Paper Lion i thought was excellent. George Plimpton achieved his dream and made the reader really understand what it is like ot be a professional football player in the mid-60's. The only difference is now football has change dramatically. All you ever hear about is the biggest football players(exceeding 300 pounds, and the media covering their every move. The book really showed me the lifesytle back in the 60's, everyone was a lot more laid back and lived a simpler life. In this book Plimpton told a lot of side stories that I thought were very funny, like the player who forgot his helmat and ran on the field, or how he practiced all by himself at the park. Over all I think this book is a good read that any football fan will enjoy no matter where they live"
4,One of Sports Illustrated's one hundred best sports books One I missed,"This book is listed as one of 'Sports Illustrated's' one -hundred best sports books of all time. Many of the reviewers of this book on ' Amazon' also consider it to be of the highest quality. They point to its giving the true feeling of what it is to try out and play football. They point to the excellent human interest stories, the way Plimpton writes about the lives of the players off and on the field.When I read this book quite a few years ago I did not really get into the feeling and humor of it. This happens often with books. The book may turn out be better than we were at the time that we read it.When I get a chance I'll have another look at this one.By the way one reviewer points out how much pro football and athletes have changed with the years, and the big big money. Even in 1965 this reader claims there was an innocent and integrity that does not pertain in the over- drugged and over- hyped sports world of today."
3,Good read but overall unsatisfying,"I was a bit hesitant about picking this one up, but my interest in sports books overcame me. I did enjoy it mostly, the highlights being the passages about George getting to ready to be the QB in the scrimmage. I think if he had actually played in the Cleveland game, then this book would end on a great note. There were interesting stories and nuggets of info about football and the preparation and how the players perform under pressure, but most of it was not too surprising. Maybe the fact that writing about football doesn't have quite the lyrical aspect as baseball does hurts the book. It was a good read, but it was missing something."
4,A SOLID READ,"THIS IS THE STORY OF GEORGE PLIMPTON WRITER OF VARIOUS SPORTING EVENTS HE PERSONALLY TRIED. HE IS IN THE DETROIT LIONS TRAINING CAMP IN 1963. HE HAS RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE TEAM TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME TRAINING CAMP SCRIMMAGES AND HOPEFULLY TO GET IN A REAL EXHIBITION GAME AGAINST THE CLEVELAND BROWNS. HE DOES A GOOD JOB DESCRIBING HIS EXPERIENCES IN DETAIL ABOUT CONDITIONS, PLAYERS, COACHES AND SOME GREAT STORIES ABOUT SOME OF THE GREATS WHO PLAYED FOR THE LIONS. I ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT TO ALL FANS OF GEORGE AND THE DETROIT LIONS."
4,good watch,"works well, accurate, the chain is especially good.Only thing to notice is the dial size is really small, but doesn't look small on hand due to the well designed chain shape."
2,Garcia Marquez parece cansado,"este libro no me gusto en lo mas minimo, a diferencia de sus otros libros que he disfrutado, este libro pide un esfuerzo sobre humano para dejarse leer, y ademas es bastante dificil diferenciar la ficcion de los datos historicos a menos que uno sea un experto en historia sur americana.Algunos datos referentes a las caracteristicas fisicas de Simon Bolivar, son datos muy curiosos pero que requeririan confirmacion.A algunas personas les agradara el libro, sobre todo creo que a los historiadores, pero para el publico en general resulta muy aburrido"

4,A Fictional Glimpse Into The Mind of Bolívar,"García Márquez, by virtue of the complex style and tone of this book, provides the reader with an opportunity to experience Simón Bolívar's last chaotic, fever-induced days. By purposefully omitting punctuation, García Márquez forces the reader to sense the existential entropy which the protagonist must endure. As a matter of literary style, García Márquez does not inform the reader as to the subject of the novel; this may perplex those readers who are unfamiliar with the life of Simón Bolívar. This literary device serves to de-mythologize the revolutionary figure in order to have him appear as a real, suffering human being."
4,Bolivar,"Me hubiera gustado leer este libro en forma digital. Me gustaria ver mas libros de escritores Sudamericanos en un formato digital.Me parece que es mejor, asi puedo llevar mi biblioteca conmigo.REcien enpece a leer este libro y me parece un Bolivar dudar es su vida pero no en el campo de batalla."
1,PIECE OF JUNK !!!!,"I got this drive today, and it's going back tomorrow. After spending hours transfering my data, I shut down the computer for a while. When I come back, Windows XP CAN NOT FIND THE DRIVE. Then when it does find it, I'm told that it needs to be formatted. I'm luckier than some of the other reviewers, because it looks like I can get my data back using Restorer 2000 and another of my LACIE drives (I own 3 of them, and never had a problem until now).Oh and I forgot to mention that the Firewire connection never worked. I dont know if it's that particular drive, but I'm not taking any chances. I bought this drive to store personal videos because they take so much space. If I need to also have backup copies on other drives, then what's the use of spending $500 on this ?!"
3,Western Digital drives in Lacie,It is my understanding that the LaCie Big Disk hard drives use western digital hard (WD)drives...I know that the terabyte model yet to be released has an internal stack of 4x250gb WD DRIVES. I have used WD DRIVES for several years without a hitch and I am waiting with anticipation for the termabyte external hard drive.
3,"Chokes on Win XP SP2, customer service is lacking","Although I'm a registered user and LaCie has my e-mail address, they did NOT notify me that the drive is not compatible with Win XP SP2 -- I had to find out the hard way. I have to return the drive in order for them to upgrade the firmware (their field upgrade failed on three different machines), and they won't do a swap where they send me a replacement first -- so I have to find a way to back this whole thing up before I return it. A big pain that they could have avoided with a single, simple e-mail -- but they don't do this as a matter of policy (per their support staff). Ugh. Thanks for nothing, LaCie."
2,Perfect timing,"I've been using a LaCie 500 GB Big Disk for managing a large amount of media for a Final Cut Pro Project. On my Mac, it worked fine for about a year -- until a week ago. Suddenly, the files were inaccessible, and a foreboding clicking sound came from the drive. I ran disk repair utility, and I was able to again access the files -- but 3/4 of them had been wiped out! I called LaCie, and the guy wasn't particularly helpful, but he did confirm that ""that clicking sound is bad news.""So I thought to myself -- at least I've backed up the data and the Big Disk is still under warranty -- I think. But when I dug out my receipt I found my purchase was exactly two weeks past one year ago. Ouch! Could they have timed it much better?So buyer beware -- and don't fail to back up your files!"
1,LaCie BigDisk is trouble,I work at a graphics company and we have large files that are stored on our server. Because of budget constraints we bought a couple of 500GB drives hoping to use them for weekly backups of our work. They have been nothing but trouble from the start. Often after properly disconnecting the drives and reconnecting them the drive is read as being unformatted. This has happened multiple times we still have our original data but will not trust the drives as a back up solution. And to cap it all off the service from Lacie is horrible we have called them several times without any real resolutions to our problems.
1,Caveat Emptor,I have been considering buying this drive for a few weeks now and was about ready to pull the trigger when I read the reviews. After all the research I've done this is the first I've heard that this is actually 2 250MB drives in a RAID 0.It is totally unacceptable that LaCie does not disclose this fact. I won't bore you with the details but RAID 0 increases your chances of losing data.
1,Disaster,"How can I describe this - it has crashed and I have lost years of family videos and photos, not to mention music.Lacie support is poor. Disk Warrior is unable to save it.Please do not buy this product - if you do you will only suffer for it.Very very shoddy hardware."
1,Only pain and suffering can come of this...,"This is the worst hard drive I've ever had, and that's going back to 1991 when I had my first computer. I have lost my files FIVE TIMES in the past two years using this thing. Luckily I have a utility called Restorer 2000 Pro that cost me about $50 that I used to surface scan the drive and pull my data off each time, but boy does it take forever to run, and you have to have another drive just as big to dump stuff onto. As you fill the drive up it gets more and more difficult to find a place to restore.Anyway, yeah, this drive is awful. It seems every time I really need to use it, it stops working. Please do yourself a favor, and steer far clear of this thing. There is much better stuff out there. I like one of the previous user's comments, about these things becoming nice bookends. Sounds about right to me."
2,Does anyone want to sell me their used unit?,"I need to pull the data from my drive, and I need a new enclosure to do so.Can anyone sell me their old 300794U so that I can put my drives in it and recover mt data?Thanks"
1,Poort product - and poor service,"LaCie Harddisks look nice. That's because they spend quite of money on design. Wish they would spend the money on customer support instead. I bought this disk twice; the first one was broken to begin with; the second was never able to connect to both my PC and my Mac. I went through a two week customer-support process through a forum, as Lacie does not give a telephone support where I live. In the end the customer service rep became rude and blamed me. It's the last LaCie product I bought. Then bought a Freecom harddisk, which worked straight away."
1,Avoid. Just Avoid.,"This drive lost over 300GB of data within one month. Recovery programs -- purchased at my own expense without any help from the almost comically rotten LaCie tech support -- were able to get back most of it. A complete nightmare. Worst of all? I have to ship the drive back to get another one. EVERY other manufacturer recognizes that you just maybe might need somewhere to put all that data which THEIR drive DESTROYED. But not LaCie, from whom I have purchased my last product. As should you."
2,Not reliable,"I have two 200 GB and two 500 GB Lacie FireWire drives. One of 500 drives started to fail after about 10 months. They exchanged it by warranty and a new drive which had only 30 days of additional warranty failed after ~ 30 days. By the way, I believe that internal drives are manufactured by Hitachi. I recently had a failed Hitachi microdrive - just after some 30 days after I bought it. My friends told me too that Hitachi drives are not reliable."
1,Unreliable hardware - Look elsewhere,"I have had this drive for just about a year and in that time, it has failed 2 times. Both times they were complete drive failures. I have checked with some friends who had simliar LaCie external devices and they reported that all had eventually failed in the short term. (Yes, I shoul have checked with them first, but I based my inital purchase on the recomendation of another friend whom I really shouldn't have.)I have owned a number of computers and drives in my life and I have never had such a poor experience with a hardware vendor. The drive has always run extremely hot, hotter then any other external drive - and I currently have a Maxtor and an HP Personal Media drive, both 300GB, neither runs this hot. Their customer service in response to having to return these drives has been less then satisfactory.Look towards another vendor for an external drive solution."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS!,"These disks are garbage! I am a Sys Admin and I purchased six of them for my users. FOUR have failed to date, two within the uber-short one year warranty period. They're supposed to be portable, but if you bump them just a little, they click and beep to signal their demise. For the ones that died outside of the warranty, I removed the two internal IDE disks, tested them and they PASSED FLAWLESSLY. The problem is obviously in the LaCie components."
1,lasted 13 months,"and almost took my feature film down with it. The customer service was unfriendly, unhelpful and led me up a wrong path to data recovery: believing that I could replace the shell and save the drives inside, I bought another one of those ($180) on eBay and took it to a local service who charged me $40 to look at it and told me it was RAIDed and they could not be put into a new shell. I will never buy a LaCie drive again."
1,A Consistent Failure,"I have had two Lacie drives. Replaced the first and the next failed also. The drive has issues with either large files or large numbers of files. Could be overheating, seems to get very hot with plenty of ventilation. Who knows?Save your money, save your data. Life is too short. Avoid this brand."
3,For home listening only.,"Forget about trying to listen to this in your car. I don't know the technical terms, but whatever process they used to reduce noise from the original vinyl platters makes it hard to hear if there's ambient noise (like traffic), even with the volume cranked way up on my car stereo. Even at home I had to crank up the volume to listen to it, so I rate this as ""ok"". Great music otherwise."
2,Not the same as described,description said a dvd was includedNOT in this edition - we returned it and were sent the same edition
3,A Great Book on Sets,"This is a beautiful book on the sets (both full sizeand miniature) of Episodes I-VI.If however, you are looking for pictures of the models,as I was, you *might* want to save your money."
5,Tub RIng !!!!,"I just saw these guys live and bought this record at the show.. Amazing record. SOngs that get stuck in your head for days. This record does feel a little lighter than zoo hypothesis but still rocks. THen there are those mellow/weird tunes like pyschology and negative 1 (that has a rockin version on their b side/dvd sonicks/optics). And just try and deny tunes like future was free, life and times of jack..., Living with rene's head, and fruit of knowledge. Not to mention the riot inducing fury called hands. For fans of good punk, any mike patton project, electronic music that you can't dance too, and people that like interesting lyrics."
4,Inkheart will Seep to Your Soul,"I fell in love with this before the movie was made by recommendation from my nerd-of-a-cousin and sped through this like it was nothing! The characters (especially Dustfinger) are stupendous, the plot was gripping and very twisted, and the antagonists...well...you get to love them in a weird sort of way, but I definitely recommend this to anyone who is a huge fan for fantasy and adventure!!! :)"
5,BIG NEWS!!!,"Cornealia Funke makes her big move when she writes Inkheart, a fantasy story about a young girl named Meggie, Mo, her father, and Dustfinger, an unusual friend of Mo's. Cornealia Funke takes her readers on a wild adventure as you flip though the pages of this enchanting book. She is very descriptive in her writing and is one of my favorite authors."
5,Amazingly Awesome! Five Star Review,"This is a great book. I have read it twice and I am not bored of it. I have recommended the book to classmates, and they also enjoyed it. Without hesitating, I would give it five out of five stars. If you like fantasy, adventure, magic, and some action, this book is definitaly for you. This book is great for young adults, and kids too. This book will keep you in suspense, and you'll never want to put it down! Cornelia Funke has done a great job on this book."
4,One of my favorites,I only buy books which I really like alot. This story is so much more than the movie and the sequels only get better and better. You have to get all three. The characters are endearing especially Dustfinger and the story has enough action and suspense to keep everyone happy.
2,Below average fantasy,"Not the worst book ever but far below average. The plot is turgid with little momentum or adventure. The ""good"" characters remain victims of the bad guys throughout which is emotionally wearing. Sometimes they escape but are recaptured due to their own mistakes and stupidity. I admire the person who read the book in a day. I have been trying to get it over with for a week but it's beginning to look like a losing battle. Still a third of the way to go but doubt if I can make it. I feel sorry for the characters in the book and for anyone who can identify with them. A girl with low self esteem might like this book but probably shouldn't read it."
2,dull,"The idea was O.K. but i just felt like there was no action and was rather flat. Some books are good for their characters, but I felt the charcters were dry and very little of their actions seemed thought out. The second and third book were better but I read them this year."
2,It couldn't hook this book lover,"A book where the characters from its pages come to life? And where there is this crazy old lady who is so book-obsessed I can almost hear her petting them and saying ""My precioussss...""? (Ok, not really, but you know what I mean). I thought this would be THE book for me, as I am wholly book-obssessed. It also didn't hurt that I enjoy the fantasy genre and that many of my middle schoolers loved this book. Unfortunately though, I did not end up loving this book. I can't at all say that I couldn't finish it because it's horrible, because it's not. The prose flows well and I must say that the audio book has an utterly fantastic narrator. I just couldn't get into it. I guess it didn't hook me and it kind of bored me. I think I got about halfway through the discs and gave up after several times I just turned it off then had to force myself to put it back on. Though I really wanted to finish it, I just couldn't get into it enough to do so."
5,One of my All Time FAVORITE BOOKS,Be taken into a world filled with magic and wonder. There are deep dark secrets some unexpected surprises and a whole lot of suspense and excitement! This book is a great page turner and teaches you the value of family.
4,Characters that truly come to life!,The magic of reading aloud takes a new twist when Cornelia Funke writes INKHEART. Mystery and fantasy blend to take the reader on a journey mixed with the past and present. The power of a writer's words bring the end of the story to a tingling climax. The characters are certainly the main theme of this novel. I would recommend this great read for 6-8th grades because the main character's age is 12 years old and the length of the novel - 534 pages.
2,Was decent but...,I found this book to be interesting but not interesting enough to even bother with reading the other books in the series. The characters were okay but I felt like there wasn't enough depth to relate or even show sympathy for the characters. Not worth reading in my opinion.
5,Really good book,I took three days to read it and I couldn't put it down. It's like Meggie says the book calls.
2,Will not hold a child's attention,"The idea of reading people out of stories and the exposition on book binding are the most interesting things about this book. After reading Thief Lord, I can only hope that the former is an original idea. Otherwise, this author is working on very little. This book is too wordy and too drawn out to keep a child interested to the finish."
3,Half way,"I loved the beginning of Inkheart,and The Theif Lord they were spectacular! But for some reason I stoped reading both of them half way through the book. Ms Funke creates a wonderful beginning to the books that she writes but then she keeps on adding more endings and not finishing them. I got really bored from reading how in Inkheart the main charaters escape from Caspians grasp but then they get got again. IT'S STUPID! To the author, if you try to end one of your novels end it don't start another ending and then another ending. Other people like me will get fed up and stop reading. I got Inkheart for Christmas in hardcover. Hello, a lot of money wasted.If you like how this author keeps spinning her stories when the yarns runnin low then read this book. If you like a good book that ends well read Journey to the River Sea, or The City of Ember steer away from Ms. Funke!"
3,atmospheric if uneven (an adult's perspective),"I had a hard time getting into this, as I found the writing quality sort of wooden. But the atmosphere really captured me for some reason that I couldn't quite explain, and I read the rest quite happily. I do agree with the criticism that the ending was much too deus ex ""magica."" Through the book I had a sense of great possibilities, but it had little of the philosophical exploration of Philip Pullman's work (although I hated the ending of ""The Amber Spyglass"" and thought it went waaaay too far in the other direction). Some of the characters are engaging (Meggie, Mo, Elinor, and particularly Dustfinger and Farid), while others could use more depth (Capricorn, Resa, and Fenoglio). Having enjoyed this, I am looking forward to reading The Thief Lord, which most readers seem to agree is the better book."
3,Its just okay,"I bought this trilogy based on reveiws I read on Amazon. Truly I think this book has potential for somebody but I usually complete a book in less than 24 hours if I really like it but I find I am struggling with this one. Even though the main character is a young girl, the rest of the characters even her father are dark, uncomfortable elements. I don't know who the target group is to purchase this book but I don't think it appeals to children (guess that depends on your kid). I am going to finish it but so far, it doesn't deserve all those magical reviews I read at all."
3,I really wanted to like this book!,"PROS: Very well written with vivid imagery and intriguing conceptCONS: Overly long, quite dry, not much actually happens and dialogue can be unrealisticI really did want to like this book! I had been waiting to read it and was interrupted by another series I devoured. My husband read 3/4 of it, looked to the end and quit (this is VERY unlike him). Perhaps this colored my judgement? Whatever the reason, I just found navigating this book to be more of a chore than a pleasure, mostly for the cons stated above. It did make me long for Italy though!"
3,"Couldn't stop reading, but nothing was left to think about","I am 46 years old. I read the book (about 500 pages) in two days or so. So I must admit it was fascinating. Nevertheless, it was a great disappointment, considering the Thief Lord.The main problem is that most of the characters are not interesting, two dimensional, and not very credible. So I read it in one breadth and all the time felt it isn't really good."
4,Michael's Review (age 8),"It was a really good book. But they do use the ""d"" word a lot. There were a lot of words I didn't understand, but I just skipped them and kept going. The begining was kind of scary, because of Dustfinger. The more I read it the more I got use to the characters. There are lots of good guys, and there was fighting and thinking to get past the bad guys.I would recomend this for people who enjoyed Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket series.I really need to read Inspell.Michael in Ohio"
5,Inkheart,"Inkheart is my favorite book, Miss. Cornelia is a woman who can write a book, and finish it! Meggie seems so much like me, a book-worm, a brave but scared girl, the only difference is our age, 10 and 12. I loved Mo, if he were real I would want him to be my English Teacher! Elinor seems sweet when you get to know her, and Capricorn, this may be silly, but I liked him! He seemed like the prefect villian that inspires me to write!"
3,Inkspell was better,"Inkheart had an original idea, but it just never seemed to get ""good."" The climax was not the best. Inkspell did continue it well, and it keeps you hooked."
4,Inkheart is okay,"I'm surprised by the reviews that said that this was the best book they've ever read. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good book, but there are many better books out there (including the author's own Thief Lord). The characters in Inkheart are a little bland, and the book drags in a couple of places. Overall, it is a good story, but not a great one. While I am anxiously awaiting the next King Fortis, Harry Potter and Unfortunate Events books, I will approach a sequel to Inkheart (if Funke writes one)with mild disinterest."
1,interesting idea poorly executed,"I'm sorry to disagree with so many others who found this book 'delightful' but aside from the idea, which is a very good one, there was very little else to like about this book. As someone else suggested, perhaps it was poorly translated, in which case the author is absolved of any guilt. But if not, then this was one of the most boring kids books I've ever read. I honestly didn't care much about any of the characters and at times almost hoped they'd all get killed off so the story would be over. At other times I just skipped ahead to get it over with. Of course, if you're ten, you may not have noticed."
2,Inkheart,"My book is a fantasy book named Inkheart by Cornelia Funke. She is a very good writer.Meggie's father reads Capricorn, Basta, and Dustfinger out of a book. Dustfinger wants to get back in the book but no one else does. Also there is almost no way for Dustfinger to get back into the book because to be read back into the book, because you have to have a book to get read back into one.This book was to me too long and not enough action. This book is probely better suited for speed readers."
2,Pfft,"Hm. I must say that this is one of the first fantasy books, on my short list of few, that I absolutely hated. The characters were incredibly forgettable, and I found no reason to be attached. It is a decent book, with incredibly long sentences that go on and describe every little detail on a random leaf in the forest that fell from a chipped maple tree that was slightly bent at the trunk.However, despite that, it is nicely written. But, don't waste your time. The cover is nice looking, but, spare yourself a few hours and don't read this book.Look out for new fantasy books that are scheduled to hit the markets in 2006."
3,im quite dissapointed,judging by the rating im probably alone when i say even though the book starts to grab you in the first few pages it really lost me i understand it and all but it just isnt my stlye at all and it does get a bit confusing
3,It's no Harry Potter,"Funke writes well enough. It's just that the story has no punch. Read Dan Simmons ""Ilium and Olympus"" or Pullman's ""Golden Compass"" trilogy before you read Inkheart."
4,Great Book!,"I really liked this book! It started a little slow, but about a quarter through it got really exciting! Buy this book right now!!!"
4,One of the best but not quite,"At first I couldn't put it down but after a while I could. Unlike Harry Potter, you have to force yourself to get through some chapters because you get bored but it's still very good. It took a while to read because of its length. She is a very talented writer but you need to really like reading to be able to read her books."
3,Painfully slow,There is no doubt that Cornelia can tell a story. This one just happened to be to slow for me.
4,Son loves it!,My son (16 yrs old) has read and reread this book and the others that go with it. Must be good!
5,InkHeart,InkHeart was a great read. I was completely taken in by the characters--even from the first chapter. I honestly couldn't put it down. I loved that the book was more character driven; the characters stayed true to their created personalities and traits. It made the story more believable.I would recommend this book to anyone--of all ages.
