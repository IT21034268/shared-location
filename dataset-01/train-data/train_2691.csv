4,Parrotheads Unite!,"If you don't like Jimmy Buffet, never had a desire to experience Key West, or think an Irish Wake can't be fun--this is the wrong book for you. D.M. Paule has done a remarkable job of recreating the whole Key West experience with some memorable characters and hilarious situations. A must-read for the Parrothead in all of us!"
1,Bad graphics and boring,This games graphics are bad and I found it boring nothing like the real thing.
2,Different with some revelations,Not quite what I was expecting. This book has its interesting aspects. I can't say that it is one that I would not necessarily recommend though.
1,One of the Few Books in the World I Couldn't Even Finish,"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews. I was extremely disappointed. I read about 60% and ended up just deleting from my phone without finishing. I've read 100+ books in the last couple of years and that's only happened 3 times. I found this book very repetitive and dull. I did not find it enlightening at all. I'm very open to alternative thinking, philosphical discussion, etc. However, this book is very rambling and incoherent."
5,Cool and right on!,This is a very cool book. Teaches us the importance of living fully in the present moment and the fulfillment to be found in the realization that integrating the earthly and the spiritual is the path to soul liberation. I was propelled by the beautiful imagery and luscious settings to feel that passion as prayer is telling the truth.
3,"At times, wonderful","I only have one other David Darling album (Cello) and none by Ketil Bjornstad. I cannot comment on other works (of course.)Obviously I bought this because I knew Darling, and I am not disapoited by his performance. His Cello work is indeed evocative. However, Bjornstad on the other hand occasionally slips into the worst (for me) of New Age. That is, trite melodies. Darling saves all of the tracks for me. Whenever Bjornstad would trip up, Darling stopped him from falling.That leaves me with a CD which I enjoyed, and that's good! It's not perfect, by any means. But few things are."
5,So beautiful,"This is without a doubt a wonderful CD.. It takes you through a beautiful, soulful journey . I find it one of the most centering CD's I own, and one I greatly treasure. If you are a David Darling fan, this is a must have."
4,Great cloth to throw in your case or gig bag,"This is my second Fender Polish Cloth. They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use. Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth."
2,Bad quaility..,"Whenever you wipe your guitar with this, so many pieces of threads will come off.Bad quality!!"
5,Easy reading; pithy style.,"This easy-to-read book, which paints the history of pre-modern philosophy in broad strokes, makes up for the lack of detail by giving us a nicely integrated panoramic view. It has been said that all of modern philosophy is little more than footnotes to Plato, Aristotle, the Sophists and the Skeptics. There is some truth in that; in any case, this book reminds the reader of the ubiquitous contribution of the ancients to the philosophical construction of the modern world.The author's style includes plenty of pithy remarks, often amusing images and clever phrases that - had he been a political speech writer - might have become more widely known quotable sound bights. I found it an enjoyable read, and strongly recommend it for the reader looking for a good introduction."
2,muddled survey,"Though exceptionally well written, the author never can seem to decide if he wants to write a survey book on the history of philosophy, of if he wants to offer up his own brand of philosophizing and also weigh in in a philosophical way on what he thinks of certain philosophers of the past, or both. Sometimes he does the former, sometimes the latter, sometimes both. He doesn't pull it off and doesn't even seem to be aware that this is what he's doing. Nowhere is this exemplified at its worst than his tendentious treatment of the so-called sophists, for whom in a very peculiar way he tries to offer an apology, and of the skeptics, whom he lumps together in a lamentably one-dimensional way. This book is worth reading, and hopefully will inspire someone else to write an even more commendable book of this type."
2,No effect noticed,"I really don't know if this product is having any effect or not. Taking it for about a month now twice a day, I honestly notice zero effect from it. Thus, it gets just 2 stars from me."
5,The best workout!,"I have been working out for 14 years. Never have I seen results like those outlined in this book. I have recommended this book to others and they are seeing awesome results as well. If you are short on time and high on commitment, try Harley's 5-factor."
5,Two thumbs up!,"I like this book! The exercises will get you into top shape, whether sedentary or fit (it took a while for me to break out of the ""more exercise, more fit"" paradigm) - and the eating guidelines will also improve your dietary habits, from junk food addicts to health food nuts. I haven't struggled with weight but have found maintaining a healthy, fit lifestyle over the long term very challenging. He doesn't bombard you with too much information and also doesn't come off as being overly-strict. It results in you making informed and reasonable decisions that become intuitive and instinctual over time. I now live by his guidelines, abide by the no flour gospel and feel great!"
4,"easy to read, easy to follow",Really great exercise and diet book. It's easy to follow and really easy to incorporate into your lifestyle
3,Eh...,You get out of what you put into it just like any other exercise and diet program. He is well known and I guess if he can help celebrities then an average person should get something out of it.
4,Almost great,I really loved this concept. I've done the workout on two seperate occasions and I do well with the structured approach. I try and stick with the food concept as well but even if I don't follow that completely I still end up losing weight and toning from the work outs. My frustration with this is that there is nothing beyond. Everyone knows your muscles get used to the same exercises over time so you need to keep changing it up. I would love to see a follow-up to this book!!!
2,good workout - bad diet,"On a positive note, the very simple workout routine is execellent for someone seeking to tone up - at least the weight lifting routine that is presented. However, the author only recommends 5 minutes of cardio a day which is not nearly enough.The nutritional information that is provided in this book is definitely not sound for someone looking for a healthy, life-long diet. With all of the artificial sweeteners, dairy products, and suppliments recommended, the practitioner of this diet is, at the best, going to have some serious digestion problems.Last, as many other people have mentioned, there is absolutely no information given on stretching given by the author."
1,Five Factor Fitness does not compare to Flip The Switch,"I just got through reading this book after seeing the author on Jane Pauley. I'm not going to say that this book is bad, but I achieved great results with a book called Flip The Switch which was written by Diane Sawyer's trainer, Jim Karas.In Five Factor, you are told you have to do five 25 minute workouts a week. In Flip The Switch, I only had to do three 20 minute workouts and I they really made a difference in my body weight and body composition.Plus, Jim Karas really knows women, especially women with weight to lose. I found out about him in Oprah's magazine as he also helped her best friend Gail King lose a bunch of weight.I would recommend anyone interested in losing weight to check out Flip The Switch."
5,Five Factor Fitness Book,Great book. It arrived just the next day just as it said it would. The book was in excellent shape...brand new. It was a great purchase and Amazon made it possible.
1,the worst fitness book ever!,I can't believe why anyone would waste their time and effort on such a fitness plan! He only believes in 5 minutes of cardio because his eating plan is so unhealthy that one would not have any energy to do more than 5 minutes! The only way one can lose weight is to be balanced with eating and exercise! His fitness plan is lame and the eating plan is worse! If you need to buy a book it is better to get Gunnar Peterson's book!
4,5-Factor,"For the most part the book was good, although, some of the recipes were not as simple as indicated. The fitness section is excellent."
4,Recommended by a Fitness Trainer,"I am a fitness trainer and I love the workout ideas in this book. I have seen Harley train and he is great. But the food ideas aren't much to speak of. I don't know where to find some of the ingredients and I imagine it would be expensive if I could. I will use his workout but eat my regular meal of oats, veggies, and good ole grilled chicken."
4,Great for working moms,"I love this book! The workouts are fun, concise, and fit right into my tight schedule. I had grown bored of my routine and this workout has re-energized me- I'm excited about going to the gym again. I highly recommend it."
3,I Have Seen Worse,"Pasternak's program is simple enough--I can count to five most days--and easy enough to follow. I truly appreciated the portion of his book where he covers exercises. He explains what the exercises are, the rationale behind the specific exercises and their specified sequence, has PICTURES (hooray), and outlines where to go from there. I like the easy meal plans; however, lo-fat/reduced fat/zero fat cheese is nasty no matter how you slice it, Mr. Pasternak! If one is disciplined enough and determined to lose weight while suffering through small meals, then this book is for you."
5,I do not know as much about fitness as the previous reviewer,"...but I can tell you that after 5 weeks on the program, I could not be happier with purchasing the book. I am 35 and just had a baby 6 months ago. I have not missed a workout because it is very easy to fit into my day. For the first time in my life, I look forward to working out. I am much stronger already and even have had to go out and buy HEAVIER dumbells. I have lost two pant sizes and feel much better about what I am eating and feeding my family.I will agree that the book does have a little too much ""filler"". I would have liked to see more recipes and progress charts, and a place to chart before and after measurements. But the program itself is working for me, and I feel great!"
5,A program that finally works,"Trust me, I have tried everything and i have finally found a program that makes sense and makes me feel great. Everything from the explanations provided regarding why i should follow ""five factor fitness"", to the exercises provided are logical and easy to follow. I must point out the recipes are delicious and really simple. I truly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look and feel great!!BM"
4,Helpful book for diet and exercise,"After quitting smoking 4 months ago, I thought it was time to start losing the weight I'd gained. Saw this author on a tv show and his approach made sense. I've started using it, but it's too soon to report results. The book is clearly written, well illustrated, and the program makes sense."
5,good info,I think this book has a lot of good old fashioned common sense info & a practical way to get fit without spend an hour on strength training & aerobics
4,Very informative and interesting!,"I have learned tons of stuff from this book. The book does a really nice job of organizing every detail. I can say already that it is a HARD read, but I guess a college book should be. I had to read some pages twice, look up some words in the dictionary, and sometimes re read the chapter just to get the information synced. I really liked the information it has taught me about diversity, unions, laws, and so on. It is very valuable information that any business owner should defiantly know."
1,terrible buying experience,"Ordered this book to use as a co-teacher for a college course. Turns out it wasn't in stock with the vendor and it took weeks to receive that information, after being told via email that the book was in stock and had been shipped out. The book itself is okay -- not the best HR text out there, but not the worst. The case studies prompted a good deal of in-class discussion."
4,Very similar to 5th edition,"I ordered this textbook because the course I was taking was written on this edition (4th) and college bookstore shipped the 5th edition. Both editions are similar however some of the ""non-necessary"" jargon and text was taken out of the 5th edition so having this edition made my course a success. There is a Case Study in the 4th edition that does not appear in the 5th so for other students looking for that Case Study I am sure the college got many emails. I had it all as I had both editions."
4,Good Book Purchase,the book i purchased was in the condition promised and was everything i expected it to be. great transaction. will do business again.
4,Really good,"I really liked this cd especially because of the song ""Hymn To Red October"" the main title, I really liked the music on the video and it's even better on the cd because you aren't consentrating on the plot you just get to hear the music."
3,Is This All The Music That Was In The Film????,"As usual, Basil Poledouris delivers an exceptional score. The UNUSUAL is that there is barely 29 minutes worth of music on the CD. Is that EVERY bit of music that was in the movie? I don't think so.....So why the selective editing? Some of the cuts on the Disc are less than a minute long!The music is great, and for the price Amazon is selling for, I guess it's worth it. But I can't go higher than 3 Stars for what amounts to a sampler disc."
3,English translation?,"""Hymn To Red October"" was my key motivation to get this CD. In fact, I was looking for it for a long time until I found it from Amazon. Two points I want to mention are: (1) Where is the english translation for the song? I do want to know what they are singing. (2) I was disappointed a bit about the recording. According to the description, it was recorded from an analog tape. Apart from this two points, I would have given it a 5 stars."
3,What happened to the Rest of the Music?????,"Don't get me wrong; I definitly like the music on this CD, with The Hymn to Red October being the showcase. But there was so much more music in the film. Why was the instrumental version of the Hymn omitted? This too-short CD could easily have been expanded. My biggest disappointment is the omission of the Red October crew singing the Soviet National Anthem-certainly integral to both the plot and the score."
5,Epic Russians,Whats more epic than intense orchestra music? Orchestra music with a RUSSIAN CHOIR! Not to mention the music itself is great.
4,Red October music rocks,I got this used and it is still awesome music. No problems and came quickly. Classic music from a great movie
4,Red October true to movie,The music was as remembered from the movie. The sound quality was less than hoped for due to the quality of the original analog tape. Some static on this recording.
3,If You like it loud & in Russian this is for you,"This is no""masterpiece""..Perhaps all of the Russian choral work reflects the theme,although there is as much that is non-Russian going on in this film as there is that concerns the doings aboard the Russian submarine..And isn't it a bit hackneyed to load up a film that has to do with the cold-war era Russian military with russian language singing?Why not just insert bits from ""Boris Gudunov""or a Russian easter service te deum?Sorry,but when not writing ""action"" noise cues or letting the Russian vocal chorus do it's thing,this soundtrack has very little to offer..."
3,""" Hunt For Red October"" Reivew","Hunt For Red October is a great soundtrack but there's some wierd things about it so I'd get as a gift Because It isin't THe best Thing In the world. bye From,RSF,CA USA"
3,Great for experienced modeler.,This boat has a couple of shortcomings. It is not properly ballasted and the RC system is very limited ability and quality. I bought the boat knowing all of this from various forums I visited. The good point is that the boat can be easily modified by a modeler by adding lead ballast to the keel and installing a quality RC radio with speed controller and rudder servo. With just a little modification this becomes an extremely fun model that looks great and performs well.
1,Making This Boat Work,As shipped the boat is charming but not at properly designed. Poor ballast. Nothing is water tight thus it sinks and dies for good. The chlorine in my pool destroyed the controller . Soo I am newly retired and want to fix these problems. It was easy to take completely apart to get at the motors and controller. Where can I get a new control board that is water tight.? The three motors survived but need to be enclosed to prevent shorting when the tug takes on water-as it will. Any suggestions from modelers. Can I get replacement electrical parts from the company who makes the tug..
1,Looks Nice. Doesn't Work.,"Purchased for my son to play with in the pool. Out of the box it looks great. Charged up battery and let him play with it. As many have noted, it takes on water and lists to the side quickly. Had to rescue it from sinking several times. Then the electrical went all screwy. The boat was turned off, but motor and water pump continued to run until I took out the battery. Suspect water in the hull (it is not at all water tight) caused electrical problems. After about 30 minutes of fun, the boat was no longer functional as anything other than a display piece. This was a big disappointment. Could have been a very cool toy, but no. The saddest part is my son really loved it for the short period of time it was working."
1,Top Heavy,"This model boat is extremely powerful. While that made - note my use of the past tense here - for fun straight line acceleration, the boat would heel over dramatically during turns. On the fifth or sixth turn, even under reduced power, the thing heeled over and sank in less than 30 seconds. It's a complete waste of money."
5,Tub Boat Review,"Everything works well on the boat, the only thing I would change would be the turning radius."
1,Not a sturdy toy!,It may be my fault but this is not really a very seaworthy toy. I guess I should have done more research. On the other hand it is designed to be put in the water. Its not watertight at all and once you get the electronics wet it is basically a useless piece of plastic. I went through three of them before I gave up. I should have just bought a more sturdy one to begin with. Great boat...just don't put it in the water.
3,OK for the price...,"The item is ok for the price you have paid. Radio, electric motor and servos are cheap, but I think this is a good hull to work with and upgrade it with better electronics. That is the main reason a bought it. If you are looking for a durable toy and you are not in hobbies, probably it is not suitable for you."
2,Tugboat review,"This tugboat is fun but is rather cheaply constructed, it doesn't float straight and the instructions for use are minimal, at best. While we enjoy playing with it, I would like for it to be a bit more durable. Also, the pump to shoot water out of the spout on the tower doesn't work."
2,Nothing But Trouble,"I have been using this stroller for only about 6 months and have had nothing but problems. It does not stay closed. When I pull it out of the back of my suv it pops open jabbing me in the legs. The basket is nice and deep but wont stay in the up position. It constantly falls down and it must be up to close the stroller. Today I went to the park and when leaving I tried to close it and the button you have to push to close it is stuck. The stroller will not even fold up!!! I spent 15 minutes in the parking lot trying to get the button to work so I could close it while sweating in the 90 degree heat and my poor 10 month old crying in the car. I eventually had to pick the entire thing up and throw it in my trunk in the open position. Thankfully I have a truck. On a good note, the stroller is nice and roomy, good for baby to lounge and the basket is deep if it does stay open. I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER! Dont waste your money!!!!"
4,Very nice stroller,"I have the Graco Metrolite in the baby classics style (same stroller, just has a fancier cloth material and costs a little more). It's a very nice stroller. Several months after using this stroller I found a Peg Perego Aria stroller on clearance for $120. I decided to use that one for awhile because it as a ""Peg Perego"" and hey, people rave about the Pegs. I used the Aria for 2 months and then went back to my Graco for my everyday stroller.The Graco is lighter than most strollers this size. The cupholders are very nice to have (and they actually fit real sized cups!). The basket on the bottom is very helpful and the reclining feature is easy to use (just move the bar up and down - no confusing drawstring which takes 2 hands here). The canopy does a decent job unlike the Aria.It's a bit bulky when you fold it up. Easy to fold, but a bit bulky. That's really my only complaint about it."
5,Wonderful for Erratic Sidewalks/Streets.,"I choose this stroller initially because it was lightweight (important for someone small or someone who does not own their own car). It definately lived up to this expectation. However, it is also incredibly durable. I live in a city where the condition of the sidewalks is abysmal and the streets are not much better. This stroller takes it all in stride. It just glides over all the bumps and holes and never wakes the baby up. I recommend this stroller for anyone small and anyone who lives in an area with bad sidewalks. The only drawback to this stroller is that it can be difficult to close at times if you don't hit both latches just right. I consider the benefits to greatly outway this factor."
4,looks new after flight,"I bought this stroller for my tall 2.5 yr old for traveling. I love it!! It is not too small but not big either. Many of the more pricy and cheaper light weight strollers sun hood did not fit over her head it rubed it is also roomier in the bottom area. She did not even fit in the Combi! she is thin. It is light but sturdy I can ""whip"" around with one hand while holding other things on the jet way. The basket can hold a large diaperbag and a large purse. We went on several flights (it was not in a cover) and it look brand new. My Evenflow was thrashed in one flight, with that cheap plastic. I love this stroller It folds up nice, smaller would be better but it is fine. I did not want a stoller than can not be sat in for awhile why we walked around. Go get it"
5,Great Stroller,"We love this stroller. It is very lightweight compared to other strollers of its size. It folds easily and is easy to maneuver--I was even using it at my StrollerFit workouts until my in-laws got us a jogger. The basket is large and can hold a lot. I like that it can recline, has a tray and drink holders for my son, and has drink holders for adults...these features are absent on our umbrella and jogger. We are very pleased."
1,We hated it,Our Metrolite experience has not been a good one. We had to replace it at 11 months-at our own cost because both back wheels have fallen off while in use. We contacted Graco and they were not helpful. This product has endangered our daughter and frustrated us. Very disappointed would not recommend to anyone!
2,very hard to close and open after a few years of use,"We've had this stroller for the past 3 years. For the last year, the stroller has been getting harder and harder to close and open. I called the company and they said that it's probably because the frame is bent somehow and there is no way to fix it. This is very disappointing for a product to last only through one child. Now we have a second baby and need to look for new stroller."
2,Very disappointing in your shipping carrier.,Purchased for a gift and when received the box was destroyed and the stroller broken. You should check on your carrier. Had to run to store (Babies R US) and purchase. Very upsetting. I chose to purchase through Amazon because I didn't want to run to the store. Thank you.
2,graco metrolight stroller,"good overall, but 1 big design flaw:cumbersome to enter and exit the stroller basket underneath the stroller. it is often les time-consuming to just carry my large diaper bag over my shoulder, instead of taking the time to wrestle the items into the underneath basket. I wish i would have know to search for a stroller with easy underneath access, like with a zipper ect.."
5,An Excellent Value,"I love this stroller. I have seen some of the negative reviews on this stroller and have to wonder if they're talking about this stroller or an old model Metrolite. The storage basket is very easy to use and is nicely raised up from the ground so it doesn't get as dirty as other stroller baskets do. I live in NYC and do a lot of traveling on public transportation and this stroller fold up very easily with one hand the only trick to it is to make sure the wheels are straight out or they can hinder folding it up. My only gripe about this stroller is the overhead window view. Sometimes the sun shines in my babys face. Graco should have put a piece of fabric with a velcro closure for such a problem but, otherwise this stroller is great."
5,I love this stroller!,"I spent a lot of time researching strollers when I was registering for my shower. After wavering between a few different types (ranging from the snap n go to the zippy), I decided on the metrolite, mainly because I didn't want to register for something as expensive as the zippy, yet also wanted something lightweight, easy folding and compatible with the snugride car seat. I was nervous about my choice, but having used it now for over a month, I'm so glad I went the route I did. This stroller folds with one hand, opens just as easily, moves smoothly on all surfaces and is an all around pleasure to operate. For the money it is well worth it."
2,Not so Hot,"I really wish I had got something else. The basket is hard to latch on and bends very easily. The foot rest is very far back and the handle not very comfortable. If I had read these reviews then, I would have bought alot of different stuff."
2,flimsy construction,"I was impressed with this stroller in the store -- it looks great and is nice and lightweight (tons better than the travel system stroller we had!). However, once we used it we realized there is no window in the sunshade (which was very upsetting to our baby) and the wheels don't always steer properly. Worse, two months after we bought it, we gate checked it at the airport and when we got it back, two of the wheels had come off (turns out they are held by little pins that break or slip out pretty easily) and the fold/unfold mechanism had completly jammed (note that neither the airline or Graco did anything for us). In short, we found this to be pretty flimsy in its construction, and would not buy it again!"
1,Tired of strollers that fall apart . . .,"My wife and I registered and had a shower back in April. One of the gifts received was the Graco Metrolite stroller. This past week the stroller stopped closing. Apparently a spring inside the unit stopped functioning. So after BabiesRUs sent us packing we called Graco. They agreed to take back the stroller and send us a check in return, so in the mean time we went out and got a replacement, we would have gone to another manufacturer but since the car seat is in this print we have to stick with this stroller. Anyway, we brought home the new stroller and as we are pulling it out of the box the handle comes off the stroller on one side. We brought this one back in exchange for now the third stroller which , so far, seems to be OK. It is a great stroller as long as it stays is one piece. I don't know if it is a poor design by Graco, inconsiderate truckers at BabiesRUs or a combination of the two but it has been a frustrating two weeks. Buyer Beware!"
1,Did not last 4 months,"All right so I spent over 4 hours debating which stroller and car seat to buy. I obviously chose wrong. This stroller is very light but that is because it is cheaply made. It does not stay in the close position very well, and then it broke while being closed. The straps are awkward to lock especially with a wiggling baby!DON'T buy this stroller."
4,Pleased,"I like this stroller. Not so crazy about it, but it does the job. It's just a little tough to fold the stroller. Also, the plastic blue covers for the wheels fell out. Other than that, it's a good stroller."
5,Think about it...please.,"Why is it that whites who live the farthest from the border are the most liberal? Because it's easy to say that diversity is wonderful when you don't have to live with the repercussions of it. This book wonderfully illustrates that people create cultures and not the other way around. Hispanics are remaking Mexico, north of the border. Why has Texas and California continued to plummet when it comes to issues of health, education, crime? It's because we're importing people with higher rates of illness, lower levels of education and higher rates of criminality? I don't like this fact any more than you and if I could close my eyes to it all (like they do in white-on-white Maine, Vermont, etc.) and pretend it doesn't exist then I would. But I cannot, and after reading this book, you won't be able to either."
1,Ignorant and biased,"The best rejoinder to Brimelow's no immigrant policy is this weeks newspapers. Both of the American Nobel prize winners are immigrants -- one from Egypt, one from Canada.But of course, the ability to distinguish between illegal andlegal immigrants, poor fieldworkers and brillitant scientists is something that Brimelow and his ilk will never process."
1,"Brimelow's ""immigration disaster""","The only immigration ""disaster"" in the United States is that we have let reactionary right-wing British expatriate white racist males like Peter Brimelow take up residence and write books here. If you read his book closely you will see that his paradigm is really England, not the United States at all. Since the days of Plymouth Rock, this country has been all about people fleeing religious persecution and oppression. Period.Brimelow's arguments for limiting immigration should be recast in another light: environmentalism. Any limits to immigration should be based on environmental concerns and nothing else. Simply put, where are we going to PUT all these people? It doesn't matter where they are from...housing them still gobbles up the same trees and open spaces. Drive around any major U.S. city and look at the housing developments going up. Recent immigrants account for an estimated 50 percent of current U.S. population growth."
1,Borjas Does a Better Job,If you want to read an exhaustive analysis of immigration take a look at Borjas's recent book. Brimelow is an extremist from the conspiracy theorist camp. His use of statistics is unsophisticated and awkward.
5,It Got Me,I have to admit when i first heard this song i wasnt impressed. As a matter of fact i thought it was booty. But then as i began to hear it more it grew on me. THe beat to this song is pimp tight and Babyface seems to hit the right notes. I would recommend buying this single for 4 bucks. Instrumental! on here. Peep it.
5,An eclectic collection of great music that defies labels.,"Anyone musically open-minded enough to listen to Bela Fleck and the Flecktones in the first place will be highly rewarded by listening to this album. Even more exciting and wide-ranging than most of their other albums, ""Left of Cool"" is a picture of a group of creative musicians who worry not a bit what you wish to label their music (jazz, bluegrass, rock, or whatever...) The album's highlights range widely from the catchy ""Communication,"" with guest vocals from Dave Matthews, to the beautiful and meditative ""Shanti."" The Flecktones venture further into vocals than usual, but most of the album is still instrumentals, featuring Fleck's great banjo playing, as well as the outstanding rythym section. This group can jam in almost any format. Very highly recommended."
3,Too Relaxed,"This was the long awaited studio albumm to follow ""Live Art"", an album that has acheived ""legendary"" status amongst most fans of Jam-music. Fans such as myself couldn't wait to see what they would do next. I was very dissapointed with Left of Cool. As previous reviewers have said, the vocals just ruin the songs. As for the instrumentals, it seems that everyone is laid back and relaxed, it lacks all of those fun, intense, upbeat tunes that made Live Art so great(Stomping Grounds, Bigfoot, UFO Tofu, Cheeseballs in Cowtown). I'm not saying there is anything wrong with relaxed songs, but when you have a 75 minute disc packed with almost all relaxed tunes, it tends to get monotonous really quickly. On the positive note, a really great track is Train to Canamarra, which is just one of those tunes that takes you off to some exotic place (hence the name) where you forget where you are actually sitting listening to the music."
4,You're All Repugnant!,"Being a professional drummer, I am already offended by Futureman's choice of ""instrument,"" but all of you that gave miserable reviews to this album dissapoint me. There is nothing wrong with this album. Futch's vocals are no godsend, but I see no problem with the Flecktones being a little bit slack once in a while. When I pick up Live Art, I'm certainly not picking it up for some fast bop, I'm picking it up for complex and mellow melodies, like that of ""Shubee's Doobie."" Don't discard ""Left of Cool,"" because some musical critic schmuck says its terrible, give it a chance, it's pretty damn good. All of you music ""afficionados,"" who analyze music instead of listen to it can cram it! YOU'RE ALL REPUGNANT!"
4,please don't sing,"flectones are amazing but why is future man singing they are the best instrumental band since miles davis's bands in the seventies and john mclaughlins mahavishnu orchestra. those bands never had vocals, why do the flecktones."
3,Someone tape Futureman's mouth shut!,"Buy and listen to ""Live Art"" to hear what the 'tones sounded like before Jeff Coffin's influences, but ESPECIALLY before Futureman started ""singing"". Five stars for the music minus two for the vocals! Three stars"
4,Awesome,"This was the first Flecktones album I got, and I really like about half of it. Big country is probably their best song ever, (is it a pseudo-remake of Big Country's ""living in a big country? I think it is) And it gives me goosebumps whenever I hear it. Sojourn of Arjuna is good, as well as communication, but a lot of their vocal tracks are kinda weird, but so are the Flecktones. At any rate, this album is worth getting just for Big Country. I am trying to get more into Jazz, so I'm trying to like some of the other songs a little more, but their definitely not bad."
5,Just like their concert!!!,This CD was just like sitting and listening to their concert all over again. The smoothness of the CD as well as the background vocals by Dave Matthews and Amy Grant are awesome. I believe this to be the best Bela Fleck & the Flectones CD yet.
3,The good news and the bad news,"Well, the good news is that there's a new studio album at last, and a new fourth Flecktone as well. Jeff Coffin's sax fits in very well with the group, and fills the musical void left by thee Departure of Howard Levy several years ago. The bad news is that there are VOCALS (yes, actually songs!) on this album, and in addition there are no tunes in general that will wow you the way much of Three Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did. Though nothing the Flecktones have done (yet) is actually bad, this album is really a bit of a letdown after the long wait. Well, just wait 'till next year..."
3,"Uh oh, Bela', contrived and semi-boring? It isn't you.","While the album isn't a complete loss, it is certainly not what I was hoping for. Now, of course, after live art we all had high expectations and anything short of a three-disc live album w/ special guests Trey, Carlos and Jerry is going to be a little bit of a let down. But left of cool it definitely is, way left. Lose some of the vocals (Amy Grant?) if not all of them. Even the instrumentals sound too overdone or without any drive. Some of the album is good while some of it seems to be stuck, as a dingleberry to the pasty ass of coolness."
1,John Bunyan`s Pilgrim`s Progress,"To Whom It May Concern;My order was placed, paid for and confirmed. Two days later, the order was cancelled by Amazon or the Usedbooks123. No explanation. The charges were reversed but the exchange rate had changed (?) so I lost $ 2.31 for nothing. Not bad return if the Seller can do that a few hundred times. My first attempt, may be my last. I gave the rating - one star, not for the book, for the process."
1,GREAT BOOK BUT READ NO FURTHER IN A LOUSY SERIES,"This book is a great sci fi read, no doubt about it.But...Be advised: in book three, the protagonist engages in anal intercourse with a young boy. I have never been so repulsed by a protagonist with whom I identified.Why does he do it?I'm not sure why. It added nothing to the plot, though it did reveal a lack of character in the hero.Gerrold endured a fire storm because of it and that's the reason why the fifth novel was never published.This series richly deserves its out of print status."
4,David Gerrold's War Against the Chitorr,"This series stands apart from your typical alien invasion: it is an ecological invasion.On a stary night there were a number of unexpected meteor showers and given time, hundreds of aggressive new species began to emerge displacing the earth's ecosystem for one that was totally alien and deadly to human beings.One of the first effects of the new alien microbes on earth were a series of devastating plagues that killed almost 2/3rds of the world population. Most of the survivors are walking wounded and all of them are traumatized.Can the surviving humans fight off this unusual invasion? Only if they can understand it.There are three books to this seiies and they are all great reading. Problem is, it isn't finished. I hope Mr. Gerrold releases the new three volumes soon. I would love to find out what happens in the end.Minus one star for being an incomplete series."
5,Bring it back!!!!,"I would have to say that this is the most far out, yet addicting series I have ever read. Just the way that the main character seems to go from low status to high status, and is involved on both sides of the war. That is something that almost no other authors have ever done. I have been looking for all the books the past year, and I would be very happy to see them reprinted. And please, if the 5th book is out yet, print that also."
3,Cute but Could fit Better,"The Doggles sunglasses get attention for my cocker spaniel. She quickly rubbed them on the ground and scratched them. Not Doggles fault that. It would be helpful if the Doggles site had a little more information to help assure a good fit. Dog sunglasses aren't a novelty, they are expected to be helpful to reduce the development of cataracts in some breeds. In future one would hope to be able to make a good snug comfortable fit. The ones I got aren't that great a fit."
3,Enjoyable but lacking,"This book was a good read... kept my interest and read quickly. Using Will Shakepeare as a character was refreshing and I would love to see future attempts to incorporate historical, literary figures in contemporary fiction. There were moments however when it seemed the content was repetitive. I found myself speed reading over passages that seemed to be saying the same thing over and over again as if for filler to make the book long enough to publish. As for the promoters: from the very moment Smythe and Shakespeare arrive at the theatre, I could sense, or visualize the movie Shakespeare in Love. The scene was similar as is the introduction of a discontented young woman who is being forced to marry against her will.... You probably remember the movie. A Brother Cadfael Tuck Smythe is not.This was an interesting attempt and I wouldn't hesitate to try a follow up story. With experience comes improvement. Right?"
2,A promising start but it flounders half way through,"The first half of the book is very enjoyable, even though there's no mystery until page 150 or so. Then, things start to sag. The characters start to engage in endless dialogs where they repeat themselves for paragraph after paragraph; characters are introduced for no apparent reason (other than a setup for the sequel); and the writing generally just gets sloppy (there were at least three ""wry grimaces"" on each of the last hundred pages.) And the solution to the mystery itself is obvious by page 20 (actually, it's obvious before you open the book, if you know a little Shakespeare.) I got the feeling the author was in a rush to finish and didn't bother to edit the last half of his first draft."
3,short and sweet,"I like that the book was short and fast paced. Very well done and I almost read it in one sitting. The only problem is, about half way through the book it's completely obvious what the 'mystery' is. But I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Very enjoyable."
4,Young Shakespeare Fleshed Out!,"Symington ""Tuck"" Smythe leaves his home and heads to London to be a player. Along the way, he comes upon one Will Shakespeare, a poet, also heading to London to be a player and (hopeful) a successful play-writer. The two form a friendship and find themselves as ostlers in a theatre troupe.Our protagonist, Tuck, gets involved in a mystery involving a lovely young woman, much above him on the status ladder. His best buddy, Will, tags along making witty quips and being almost more a of a nuisance than a help in the mystery solving department.Hawke has made a very real Will Shakespeare, spouting soon to be Shakespeare-isms and acting as a word-sparring partner with Smythe. Will is just an ordinary man, with the barest hint of the Shakespeare that is to come. It is well-done and the mystery itself was well-written. I thoroughly enjoyed it and cared enough about Tuck and Will to want to read more of this series."
2,I was expecting a ton more from Paul,"Before I review this title let me state that I'm fairly knowledgeable when it comes to movement. With that said this book did very little to educate me on movement. Paul however did explain his primal pattern for movement through graphics but for the novice trainer or coach they would have to do a lot more research to implement that concept into an assessment. I will not criticize movement that matters for being a short title, however the book had very little flow to it, which magnified how short the title is. I wouldn't recommend this one."
1,Inaccurate Product Description!!!,"I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!"
3,inside the biz,"This documentary bombards you with so many opinions and facts that it takes effort to digest all of the information. You learn a lot about this industry that is usually secretive. They interview male and female stars, however, like much heteropatriarchal works, this shows lots of female nudity and no male nudity. This is true despite interviewees saying the business is trying to attract more (straight?) female viewers. Unlike many documentaries, this one included optional Spanish subtitles. For those who want to know about this business, this is a must-see. It may also be good to see along with reading Jill Nelson's anthology ""Whores and Other Feminists."" The topic of erotic labor is finally getting the serious attention that it merits. One Eurasian actress is interviewed, but this film shows no Black or Latino porn actors or actresses. It was very Eurocentric and doesn't discuss white privilege and the abundance of blonde actresses in this arena."
5,Adult Stars Living Their Chosen Life,"This gets a five-star rating from me. This documentary touches on the variety of reasons why some people have chosen this type of paying occupation. I found it refreshing to hear reasons for opting in from the performers, directors and producers themselves.Their reasons are many and varied and for that they should be praised not ridiculed. I recommend this DVD to anyone that would like to know why they do what they do, how they chose their occupation and the measures they take to protect themselves from harm."
3,Interesting...probably could use better editing,"As other reviewers have stated, this is a documentary and not actual pornography. It's not even a documentary masquerading as pornography. You will see some nudity but it's all pretty incidental.What I like about it is that it does actually provide glimpses into these people's lives--how they think, why they do what they do, what motivates them, even to some degree what their interests are aside from having sex. Some of them are very smart and wickedly funny. Some will have you scratching your head as to why they do this when it would seem that they could have better lives doing something else.The one hangup that I have about it is that it runs a bit long (I actually fell asleep in the middle of it) and there aren't any real viewer cues when subject matters are changing. It's sort of like one giant dialog spliced together from many different sources.Worth a look if you're interested in this field, though."
1,The Secret Lives of Adult Stars,"I was not impressed at all. The documentary is amateurish, very commercial and too narrowly focused. After purchasing it, I immediately resold it at the CD/DVD exchange store. Do not recommend!!!"
4,Hmmmm......,"How to describe Ardor? The only other author I've read who's as quirky - quixotic - imaginatively creative - as Lily Prior is Jasper Fforde, but the 2 are quite different. Having read La Cucina, I had some idea of what to expect from Ardor. At first it was difficult to accept the premise of mule as narrator, but I gradually became quite fond of Gezebel. The female lead, Fernanda, is introduced as powerful and mysterious and remains so throughout the story. There is also a (human) baby who flies! Prior does a good job of conveying something of the Italian personality and lifestyle without resorting to stereotype. If you like Italy, strong characterization, potent but not blatently graphic sexuality, AND can suspend the need to be bound by reality, you will probably enjoy Ardor."
5,A Real Page Turner,"This murder mystery will keep you turning the pages! It's full of very colorful characters who are so well developed that you can probably think of someone you know or have met that will remind you of them. There's lots of humor and wit with a very solid plot. You will probably not be able to figure out who the murderer is until the author is ready to let us know, but if you're a murder mystery reader, perhaps you can. I haven't read a murder mystery in a long time and this one was a lot of fun. This writer's style is very natural and easy-going, very impressive, especially for a first book. This is the first in a series and I'm looking forward to the next one."
1,Bad Choice,"I had looked everywhere local for a plush eagle for my son, but ended up ordering this one. I *thought* Wild Republic was a fine quality company, (love their Audubon Birds) so maybe we just got a lemon....This item it packaged in a plastic bag, and when I removed it, so I could wrap the eagle for a birthday, I noticed the hole on the back where they stuff the animal was open. The string was there, just not pulled tight, or knotted. As I was sewing that hole, I came upon a small hole by one of the feet. Fixed that, and wrapped the gift.The evening of opening his presents, my 9yo found another small hole, and one wing was halfway off. I wanted to send the toy back, but my son, who is NOT rough with his plush toys, just wanted me to fix it. I did, but found myself sewing the *other* wing last week.This eagle is not even a month old. At this rate, I should have all the cheap seams replaced with my own quality work in a couple of weeks."
3,What you can't tell from the pictures.,"Though the shipping was fast, and the price is unbeatable, what you are really getting from this product is a pain in the [...].Its REALLY small, about 2"". I use it right outside our front door, and no one can detect it's even there. Which is good. It is weather sensitive and cannot get a drop of water on it. I had to build a small box to go around it for when it rains and snows. In the description it says this camera is able to be used at night, thats a lie. That was one of the main reasons I had bought it. We have had a series of break-in's to our car, at night time. I hooked up the camera to our VCR and began recording. As soon as night fell, i could not see ANYTHING outside. It was black. So I turned on our light outside, and i could make out the drivers side door, but that was it. Everything else was grey and black, and nothing could be seen. So if you are looking to buy this product for night vision, outside use, or to monitor outdoor safety....DONT."
4,Brilliant!,"When i saw the movie.. i was taken aback by the moving music throughout the film. I had to buy the Score, My personal Favourites are ""Siberia"", ""The Clock"", and ""The Letter""... these three, i found extremely moving to me. Giving the movie the atmosphere you would expect from the scenes in which they were used. Although, there was ONE tiny dissapointment with it, i wanted to hear more of the soft, emotional music from the scenes with Lara Croft and her father, Lord Croft... all in all though, the album is a must purchase."
5,AWESOME!,"Excellent CD to listen to. Upbeat and thrilling, especially for dancing or working out. Great drive CD too. Graeme Revell knows how to put together excellent soundtracks!"
3,For the complete Switchfoot Fan,"Most people will enjoy this album if they are fans of Switchfoot's older music. Although the album has a few hits from ""The Beautiful Letdown"", most of the CD features hits from earlier albums. My only complaint about the album, is that it is an entirely digital recording from what I hear. The songs are not performed by a real string quartet. If you are a fan of classical music then this might bother you, otherwise it is a pretty good album."
2,Disappointing,"First of all, I'm a big Switchfoot fan. I also occasionally enjoy classical music. I've even enjoyed previous string tributes to other bands. Strung Out on OK Computer comes to mind, as well as a Pink Floyd tribute.But this just doesn't work for me. I liked maybe two of the songs on here, the rest sounded cheesy and pretentious. I ended up giving my copy away to my little brother for Christmas. :o)And I don't even know what ""The Sharing of Tries"" is."
4,Uncannily accurate post-bull market investment advice.,"When I first read The Agile Investor over a year ago, I found its forecast of a long-term acceleration in inflation to be well-reasoned. But it seemed implausible in the context of the ""goldilocks"" economy and rip-roaring stock market of that time. About a month ago, I picked up the book again and found to my surprise it had largely forecasted the deflationary catastrophe that's now threatening the world. Suddenly, its basic contention that the world must choose now between higher inflation and a devastating new Great Depression is being debated in the highest levels of government, with inflation being by far the likely winner. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of where the world economy is heading, which I believe is critical for building a profitable long-term investment strategy."
5,open up your heart/ears/mind/arms and get ready!,"jason morant delivers with open! every track is excellent, so if you are pretty music savvy and want a good return on your money, then this is an amazing investment! musically/vocally it has a huge range. superb writing and arranging!!! a very anoited/talented young man (and team of course), some of my favorites are:1.open3.i will run5.Holy6.offering8.belong9.Abba11.veils12.display my love13.all of me14.at Your feet15.Hosannayou will not be disappointed i love this whole album! bravo jason! bravo!"
5,Your ears won't believe this!,"If you like HOT jazz, you've got to ""digman"". I've been an avid jazz fan for about 25 years now, and I've heard many different styles and genres, from different jazz eras. This, much to my surprise, is jazz at its finest. I never heard of Ivan Paduart until I heard ""digman"" on real-one player radio. After being completely awestruck at his modern day swing style with a tantalizing pinch of fusion in the ""digman"" piece on the streaming Jazz Network station, I decided to look further into the entire album to see what the man was really all about. All I can say is that this album is nothing short of marvelous! He plays very good compositions of modern day swing/big band/fusion jazz that is very pleasant to the ears and actually inspiring. Check out the samples of each track then maybe you'll understand. If you're into this genre of jazz you won't be disappointed, trust me. Add this album to your collection, its a good one."
3,"It's OK, but gets tedious after a while","The premise of sailing the 7 seas and trading both legal (and not so legal) goods is fun, but there isn't a lot of variety in the game. Once you upgrade your ship and buy stuff for it, you are pretty much unstoppable. Even the ships that challenge you because you are trading illegal items are no match for a powerful trader ship.But if you want a game that is not so complex and want just to pass the time a while, then the game is still a fun play. But after a while it got repetitive."
4,"Sea Trader VS Original TRS80 TAIPAN, not quite, but fun..<>.","The Original Taipan of TRS-80 days had better play, tho Sea Trader has rather nice graphics, and fun port to port trading, sure many will like this one..So far in my brief playing it is too forgiving, example Taipan took you to Davy Jones rather swiftly, and during rare extended plays into the night, tho huge amounts possible, you quickly learned to Bank profits else your wealth was stolen, unpaid loans or large Cargos brought a Whole Armanda of Pirates, and if the Pirates didn't get you a Storm eventually sunk your vessel..Psst the one who made the famed Car in BACK TO THE FUTURE, tried to make swift profit by selling illegal commodities over the border to extend the company, aking him why he did this, responded, got the idea from playing TAIPAN!!..Car is now rare and highly collectable as the orignal game(s)...But again has enough for those not exposed to the original(s), leaves me yearning for the more realistic play..<>.."
5,What Color Was Jesus?,This is a very informative and helpful book. I have learned a lot and seriously recommend that everyone read it!
2,Chair gel cushion,Not what I thought it was going to be. I assumed it was as advertised already filled with gel. I had to add water and it's just not what I thought it was to be.
1,Does not work!!!!!,"I purchased this item at the same tine that I purchased my Creative Zen Microphoto 8 gB MP3/FM receiver (Which by the way is great!. I purchased it because the Zen can usually only be charged by hooking it up to the computer through the usb port. Since I use the Zen while I an working at the computer, this is no big deal. But I thought that if for some reason I needed to charge it up, this wall plug adapter would come in handy.Well.............. I plugged in the Zen and left it to charge for several hours and nothing happened. The battery level was the same. Soooo I let it charge all night - nothing. No difference in battery level. It's a great idea - if only it would work!"
1,Does not work,The device does not work. I plugged it in and it never turned green or charged my MP3 player. I had it plugged in for 9 hours. Don't waste your money.
2,Don't waste your time.,Bought it after reading the one review that sang its praises.Truth be told it DOES'NT work with the Creative Zen you can leave it plugged in over night... with very little change in battery level.
1,Same as with other harsh reviews,"I've bought every aftermarket charger for the Creative Zen MicroPhoto, and found that this and the other ones do not fully charge it..! Only the official chargers work with the MicroPhoto and Creative products, so don't waste your time and money on this wall charger or other ones. Get the official charger because it ACTUALLY works, LoL. Do you know what I do with this charger now? Nothing. It has been sitting on my floor for, how long has it been?- since I bought my Zen. Now it has a nice layer of dust and I still don't have the heart to throw it away. Maybe someday it will work? Na."
1,Does not work with Creative Labs Zen Micro Photo,"Do not waste your money, this was under recommendations, but I would NOT recommend this with your Creative Zen.My daughter purchased this after saving up for an MP3 player, this just does not seem to give enough power, we plug it in and 12 hours later it is still charging. Plug the MP3 into the computer USB and it is done in less than 2 hours.It may work fine for some other things but not the Creative Zen. It would cost more to return and they will only exchange it, so guess we are just eating the cost and S & H. I should have read the reviews before; would have seen that you get what you pay for, don't waste your money."
3,"works, but takes forever to charge","I purchased this so I could charge my creative zen microphoto, because the wall charger for that was too expensive, and I figured I might as well buy an adapter that charges any item with a usb port. This is dirt cheap, but it takes a couple of days to fully charge my zen, when it is supposed to be ready to go within 5 hours. Im not complaining too much as it is so cheap, and it at least works.**UPDATE** Nevermind, i would give this a 1 out of 5 stars, b/c this piece of junk just stopped working. When I first got it worked alright, just took forever to charge, but now it doesn't even do that. My zen will says its charging, and when I unplug it the meter is empty. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,Listen to what they say!,"Yup, thought for 10 bucks I'd give it a try. Wrong answer, save your money. Doesn't work with my creative zen micro photo. Tried to charge all night long and didn't do a thing. I just went to the creative website and found that they had the charger for the zen micro on sale for $10. Live and learn."
2,Dosen't work for the ZenMicro 8gb.,"I bought it so I would have to spend so much on the wall addapter from Creative. But I soon found out that it lied to me. My player says that it is charging, but really it isn't!"
5,very good,very comprehensive and usefull book for learning how to cook any kind of persian food with the best taste.the most important thing is just to follow up the recipe then you will become the best chef :)
5,The taste of Persia,"Many people say:"" what you eat is what you are""This book is a fabulous combination of Persian food recipes and Persian charms. It shows the colour, taste, and thoughtfulness of Persian life. A kind of life that carried this nation out through centuries of hardships and harshness.The author has put lots of love of her roots and has done a beautiful job. As a gourmet cook I must say: this book is a must to have in every kitchen, where the food is being treated as a piece of art!"
5,best book of iranian cooking.,"i was invited once to my aunts house for lunch ,& i tried a new kind of rice with orange peel...(it was delicious). i asked her where she get the recipe ...then she showed me the book (new food for life). i also recommend the rice cookies which i can`t live without.....my ant sends me thoes cookies each week & i can`t tell her to STOP!. the book is filled with good photos."
4,It's creative but not necessarily Iranian.,All food are good and creative. The book is very easy to understand for other language people. It's very big many of the food there is not from Iran it's just middle eastern. So if you want to cook only Iranian food you can find a cheaper one but this one is a complete book for middle eastern food.
5,Excellant!,"I love this book! Excellent Persian recipes accompanied with beautiful amazing pictures of Iran and its culture. The book is embedded with interesting stories and lovely Persian poetry written in beautiful Persian handwriting. As someone who loves to cook, in any cookbook I always look for recipes which are local and traditional and this book is full of such recipes. The book speaks volumes of Persian culture and tradition throughout. Each recipe is accompanied with a photo and easy to follow directions. This was a beautiful gift from my husband and will be among my favorite cookbooks for a very long time."
1,Food of Life - great disappointment,"I bought the first edition of this Cook Book long ago in New York and wanted to share it with friends in Australia. I was extremely disappointed with this ""second edition"" the first was brimming with exquisite photographs that drew the reader in to every page. It looks as though the author has decided to reshoot the book herself. Big Mistake, why would anyone want to compromise such a great accomplishment as the first edition. I feel as though I was duped - even the title is a trick - Changed from Food for Life to Food of Life. A second edition should improve on not detract from the previous work."
5,Ever cook with unripe grape juice?,"If you get this cookbook, you just might cook some dishes with unripe grape juice, barberries, rose water, or sour cherries! I definitely agree with what other reviewers have said about the value of this cookbook: 1) the recipes always turn out beautifully; 2) the pictures are tantalizing; and 3) the sections on various holidays and ceremonies are informative and interesting. I have three favorite recipes in this book: pomegranate chicken, orange chicken, and celery khoresh. A ""khoresh"" for those who don't know is a class of foods that are similar to stews in consistency and which are served over basmati rice. You would NEVER believe that celery could taste so flavorful and delicious. No joke. One tip I might add if you're interested in cooking Persian food is to go out and buy yourself a cast iron dutch oven. They aren't that expensive (on the order of $35), and they're unbeatable for giving food a rich, old world flavor."
5,EXCELLENT! Easy to Follow! YUMMY!,"I will keep this very basic, because I am not good at being a critic. I am not a great cook. I have had no home training in this area. I was born and raised in the USA and have Irish roots. I bought this book to learn how to cook for my future husband. The recipes are EASY to follow, simple to create, and they taste fantastic. Some of the ingridients are difficult to find in some remote areas but any basic city grocer will have what you need. I recommend this book for ANYONE that is tempted to delve into middle eastern cooking. This book is a one stop shop because it offers a complete array of dishes from appetizers, drinks, main dishes, non meat dishes, and desserts. It also has the most beautiful photography too! You feel like you are really using the recipes of a person you know and can trust! Interested in Middle Eastern cooking or Persian cooking? This is the only book you will ever need!"
4,Delicious,Great recipes for amazing food. Only down side is that not all recipes have pictures of what the final product should look like.
3,Beligian waffler,"it works well, but makes very thick waffles. You have to put butter on it to get any crispiness to the waffles since you aren't supposed to use spray oils on it."
4,Not bad. Good deal. Maybe operator error,I might be doing something wrong. The user manual says that the waffles are finished when the handle can be easily lifted. I found by the time the lid can be opened the waffles are very well done. Too done. They are edible but a bit brown. Maybe more experience would help. I lived with a two slice waffle maker for years. It took forever to make waffles. Now the time is cut in half. No seams to worry about either. Easy cleanup. Nonstick works great. Just brush with oil or butter and it's good to go. Just poor in the middle and put the lid down. Glad I bought it!
3,Closure piece comes off,Machine works well. Front closure piece keeps on coming off. There's no other way to open the Waffle maker besides for this 'lock' piece that is not so secure.. a little badly made!
3,handle falls off,"I really like how it cooks, but the only thing is that the latch that keeps it closed just pops off so easily when you try and open it. That is pretty annoying"
5,A good buy,"This Belgian waffle maker performs well each & every time. It requires less time for the waffle to brown than one previously owned. After the initial oiling, the waffles do not stick--a big plus."
2,"Keeps water out, but hurts my nose","This product was not designed for people with large noses. I wouldn't say my nose is enormous, but it is larger than average. Even after adjusting it the widest fitting, the plastic strip cuts into the bridge of my nose, which causes minor discomfort and leaves a mark. I've never experienced this problem before with other goggles."
3,TYR racetech clear goggles,"I am a surf lifeguard and I got these for open ocean swims/ run-swim-run events. My goggles see a lot of abuse in the sun, sand, and salt water. Some other guards have the same goggles and I have noticed that they all get foggy due to sand abrasion and sunscreen residue. The strap will also degrade quickly in the outdoor environment. As far as cheap goggles go, this is a reasonable pair- especially in an indoor pool situation. If you plan on using them heavily in the ocean, however, you may want to look at a hardier pair elsewhere."
2,Leaked and fogged up immediately,The price seemed too good to be true and it was. The goggles leaked & fogged up from the beginning. Dissappointed.
1,product disintegrated,"First wearing: Goggles squished the eyes into the socket, uncomfortable but they worked. Second wearing: eye cushion split for no reason and fell off and could not be repaired, so I took off the strap to use on another pair of old goggles with broken strap. After using that strap a couple times, I found the strap all melted into itself and the goggles. The strap is now a sticky mess and the only part salvagable is the plastic buckles. These goggles are horrible. If it is not too late and I can find the receipt I will try to return them so the manufacturer can see the mess they became. TYR Racetech Performance Goggle"
2,Not as Good as Other Books on Deal Makers,"This is a mediocre biography and a poorly written book on deal making. While it does shed some light on the character of Carl Icahn, it does a lousy job of describing and analysing the deals involved. The author, from time to time, mentions how many shares of a target company Icahn had acquired but never tell the readers how many percentage of interest in a company those shares represent. Or, the author tell you Icahn made several millions in a particular deal, but never points out how much Icahn has invested in the first place. This makes it very hard for the readers to follow the deal and to see how great Ichan is at doing deals.If readers are interested in deal making, I highly recommend ""The Vulture Investors"" by Rosenberg. Actually, for those who are interested in Icahn's life, reading a few chapters from ""The Vulture Investor"" and ""Predator's Ball"" is even better than reading the whole of this book."
3,Boxing With a Step Add-On,"I was looking for a way to enhance my step workout by adding some boxing, which was the wrong approach for this video...I think people who are into kickboxing (with the emphasis on the boxing; not a whole lot of lower kick-boxing moves)looking to augment it with some basic step might enjoy this. What frustrated me is that there was absolutely no break-down or instruction of the boxing movements. A tutorial would have been really helpful to demonstrate the calls, as they seem fairly simple if you knew what to expect. There is a quick tutorial offered but it only breaks down a couple of the step moves which are already simple to anyone who has had basic step.For people who already know the boxing calls, I think this could be fun and it's worth noting that you get a lot for your money...even though this is advertised as a 30-min workout, there are at least a half dozen (I didn't count) extra, full-length workouts offered."
1,A work in progress,"At the moment Photo Printer 5 lacks documentation, makes templates hard to find unless you know the brand of paper your favorite template might be stored under, collage feature does not store as a template so that a new photo can be inserted without starting over, difficulty in pulling in photos from different sources, and in determining the order in which they appear within a template.On the plus side is ability to add printed comments and better photo editing.Stick with Photo Printer 4 for most purposes and watch for improvements in this new version."
4,Great Fun,"I've not only read this script, I've acted in it. Brad Field preceded me by a few years on the Showboat Majestic, which was the last traveling showboat in the world. (I was on the Boat the summers of 1956-58.)In addition to traditional melodramas like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" (a bore), ""Ticket-of-Leave Man,"" and Dion Boucicault's ""The Streets of New York"" (my favorite), we performed Brad's ""Lust, Lucre and Liquor.""""Lust"" was perfect for our cast, which was composed of talented and not-so-talented college students. As performers, we possessed one trait in common: we gave the plays our best shot but we didn't take ourselves too seriously. ""Lust"" gave us the trappings of the conventional melodrama plot combined with sly but broad humor.I have fond memories of this play. I played the father of the beleaguered family. I played it not well, but ... energeticly.David KeymerModesto CA"
4,Good step,"This has been perfect for the kids to get up to the sink to brush their teeth. It's been fun for me to open every few days to see what else they have put in the open/close top. The stool is well constructed and safe. Even while taking a fair amount of water, we have noticed no swelling in the wood. It was quick and easy to assemble."
5,Handy way to connect XLR cords to Canon GL2,"I had read reviews that weren't totally positive about this item. As far as I'm concerned, it meets my expectations. It's a handy way to connect XLR cables to a camcorder not otherwise equipped to receive them. It would be nice if it had a switch to allow one channel of sound to be combined into both channels. That's a small drawback, however, because I can do the same thing in my editing program."
4,"Pricey, but well worth it.","I've had some problems with the GL-2 having a mic so sensitive that it was picking up the sound of the tape running while recording, plus it picks up alot of background noise, so to get better sound I needed to go with an external mic on a boom pole. The GL-2 does in fact have an audio in jack on it, which this device plugs into, but undue strain (like using a heavy XLR converter) notoriously damages the jack making it useless without this or similar items. Is the other item other reviewers mention better? Probably not, but it is cheaper. I'd rather be right than cheap any day."
1,Check your blood pressure....,"My husband used this product for about 2 years. One day he had a yearly checkup and found that his blood pressure had sky-rocketed to very unhealthy level. The doctor had asked him what he's been drinking/eating daily. After further review the doctor suggested removing the Spiru-tein from his diet altogether to see what would happen. 1 month later he had gone back to the doctor's office to get his blood pressure taken and it had dropped back to within normal range (this was w/o changing his diet). We eat pretty healthy (i.e. fish, chicken, salads, etc.) so we knew that the Spiru-tein had to be the culprit.Although the packaging on the product states that it's heart-healthy, I'd check your blood pressure periodically. This goes for all the other flavors."
3,Taste may vary.,"I was really excited to try out this flavor of protein. It turned out to be mediocre at best. I prefer expensive whey proteins for taste, but have recently cut them out. Comparing this to plain rice or hemp protein I also purchased mixed with PB2 makes this protein useless to me. The packaging and labeling is really nice. The flavor ideas are good. I'm really impressed that they hit every RDV on the label too, it just tastes like something I imagine vegetarians would enjoy. If I could go back in time, I'd buy the sample pack of flavors and try those."
1,Sharp LCD tv's have major problems,"We purchased two Sharp LCD tv's from CostCo and within 8 months the smaller one just stopped turning on. There was some sort of a light flickering at the bottom, but no picture or sound. We also have a larger model and just after one year we noticed 3 medium sized digital looking lines streaking through the screen. We were sick. We know Sharp won't do anythign and we should have bought an extended warranty. WE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SHARP!!! Has anyone else experienced these problems? do you have any suggestions? We are goign back to the old school TV's."
1,OK if you want a disposable TV,"This TV worked fine for a while, but don't pay much because my set stopped working after 13 months. The people at Sharp were willing to fix it for over $230. The set started shutting itself off every time it was turned on. I wouldn't buy a Sharp product based on the technical assistance I received in trying to get this fixed."
4,Helpful,"This book was very helpful for my 13 year old son. Since he's not big on reading,the length of each devotion was a plus. He got a Godly message in minutes a day."
3,"Great singer, but short changed","Joe is an awesome vocalist and he performed well in the concert. The main problem was that he short changed us on the songs that made him so popular. He spent most of time on stage singing newer, less appealing songs. Joe only song a short medley of the songs from his best CD's (All that I am, My name is Joe and Better Days). These were the songs that I really wanted to hear. Also, when compared to R. Kelly's (Light it up)concert DVD, this seemed low budget and looked like it was filmed in a small night club. Joe is one of my favorite artists, but he needs to spend more time singing his signature songs from the previously mentioned CD's."
1,rise is way to short!,this diaper is way smaller than a lage should be. the rise is really small. It doesnt come close to fitting my 16 month old.
5,LOVE MY BOOM BOOM !,"IF YOU LOVE THE BLUES, THIS IS A GREAT GROUP! THE MUSIC IS UPBEAT, THE SINGER HAS AN INCREDIBLE VOICE, & THE GUYS ARE DOWN-TO-EARTH....WHEN ARE YOU COMING OUT WITH ANOTHER ABLUM BOOM BOOM? THIS BAND IS SOOOO GOOD I'VE HIRED THEM IN THE PAST FOR A PARTY! A++++"
5,Incredible,"'Us And Them' is my favorite industrial album. Arguably the most bleak and depressing music anyone will ever hear. The vocals roar with such urgency, it seems their warning listeners of an impending holocaust. The minimalistic approach really puts an emphasis on every apocalyptic sound. The infectious beats have purpose, and pounds through the speaker like a sledgehammer. I have an extra copy on hand just in case the world ends -- Godflesh is the perfect soundtrack. Highly recommended.Also check out:Streetcleaner"
4,It's worth it,"This is the lp that takes for a bit of roller coaster ride. Granted it does have the GF trademarks like the drum machine,etc. But like other lp's shows experimentation. Each recording having it's own identity. Us and Them is no exception. From the nihilistic ""I,ME,Mine"" to the psychedelic title track to the melodic ""Bittersweet"" which is the answer to ""Frail"" off of Songs of LOve and Hate. There are some things here and there I wasn't really into. I don't like ""Defiled"" at all. Mostly I really enjoyed this. Not nearly the rank of Streetcleaner but what is? This is worth picking up if you are a fan of heavy industrial"
3,Fun,"This is a fun, cute movie- blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah!"
3,Silly but cute romantic movie with beautiful scenery!,"If you are looking for a romantic movie that's fast paced, and kinda cute then you may enjoy this movie. It's kind of silly in parts but the scenery is lovely! It was filmed in Tahiti and the ocean, beach, and mountains were breathtaking! Always enjoy Kathy Bates. She's funny. Katherine McPhee (singer & stars in SMASH) is good and Rob Schneider is well... Rob Schneider. ;-)"
4,It is What It Is,"If you need a romantic comedy fix you would do well to look here. Cute and fun, although unoriginal. Still worth the rental price."
3,okay,This was good for a few laughs but a little cheesy. Rob Schneider was the best with his usual corny characters.
3,Light hearted fun,If you are expecting some great film classic you are not going to get it here. However the movie is good light hearted entertainment with some good laughs. I would have given it three and one-half stars if there was a way to. Beautiful landscapes and views. The actresses are pretty easy on the eyes too for most of us males.
4,You may not kiss the bride.,"Great flick. Comedy drama romance, great date night movie. Will watch it again. Highly recommend. You will laugh, you might cry, you might even cry from laughing."
1,****** WOULD NOT DOWN-LOAD *********,"WOULD NOT DOWN-LOADWasted 1 hour trying to trouble shoot problem **** NO JOY ***** HAVE GIVEN UPAMAZON JUST RUNS YOU AROUND IN CIRCLES... NO EASY FIXAM GOING BACK TO ROXIO , AT LEAST WHEN THERE IS A problem THEY WILL OPEN A CHAT BOX AND FIX THE PROBLEM .."
2,Silly,This movie at best a waste of time. It was silly and not entertaining in the least. It was cheesey. The only claim it had to comedy was all of the Sexual innuendos that were in very bad taste.
2,"Bad script, decent acting",The best part is that you get 7 days to watch it. Whoever gave it 5 stars must be related to the cast.
1,This is trash.,"This garbage is not worth owning. The writer is borderline insane. His ideas are that boxing is the only way to fight, and his broken English is next to impossible to follow. The author or his representitives are online over on Yahoo and plague the clubs with SPAM and obnoxious posts even after being asked to stop repeatedly. The material that we have viewed is poorly made and the instruction is of very poor quality. You would be better off going to a third grade playground and learning to fight from the class bully. Do yourself a favor and donot waste your money on these books."
5,very cute,I just got this today and thought it was so much fun - I can't wait to use it. I expected it to be plastic so wasn't disappointed. I thought the quality of the singing was very good. I can't believe people were disappointed with this item. It should liven up any birthday party!!
2,Really Loud,"The cake plate is well made and the lights are great for kids parties but word to the wise. There is no volume control that I have found and it is extremely loud. It sounds like a bad new year's eve recording of Happy Birthday. The first time I played it, it sent my 1 year old into the other room as fast as he could crawl."
3,Fun but a little cheap;y made,The kids loved this! But it is pretty cheaply made. It is not that color as shown in the picture - it is a clear plastic with much fewer lights than shown. I didn't pay full price for it so I am not un-happy but I would be upset if I had paid the full price as listed.
1,Nana,I was very disappointed in the product. We were unable to get this product from our former vendor. We had hoped that it would be as great as the first muscial cake plate we had bought. Not so at all. Very disappointed.
2,no muy bueno,"Las unicas dos canciones que valen la pena son la murga de panama, y lagrimas, que es una version nueva. Las demas, la verdad es que no. Un muy olvidable disco."
3,A wee bit out of date.,"This was a required text for a course I took in bilingualism. I had high hopes for the book but was unfortunately disappointed at its narrow scope. And, it is horribly out of date. The first chapter, even in its newest edition, refers to Russia as USSR. There are a lot of theories of bilingualism discussed, mostly explained well enough to get the idea. But sometimes, it seems as though the author gets caught up in the explaining and forgets to get to the point. On a positive note, there are numerous examples of bilingual speech presented, many from the author's own experience. The case studies in the latter half of the book are quite interesting as well.All in all, I would say if you're getting started in the study of bilingualism, this is an okay book to get your feet wet. Howeve, I wouldn't depend solely on this work."
1,AWFUL,"I do not recommend this awful thing to anyone. You can hardly understand the directions. The parts don't really fit and when you finally get it put together, it looks like a four year old put it together. If you have another choice to buy something, do, but we needed something that held that many dvd and so this is what we got."
1,Never Got it,I ordered this item and never received it. It has been over two weeks when I got the email from Amazon. Why bother selling it if you won't send it out.
3,Way too tame,"This is a live performance by a working band. An organ trio with all members on equal footing. I know these guys can kick but for me there is no spark here. Maybe it's Dan Wall's pensive use of the B3 (I've never heard anyone else use it the way he does). Oh, the guys get in a groove and there is some give and take. If you like the intellectual side of jazz, this is probably for you. If you're looking for some heat, well ... maybe not."
4,Yet another Rock Tribute as a String Quartet,"Well, They sure are gonna have alot of these laying around.This time it's Mudvayne's turn,If I was forced to find a single word to describe this it would be: Interesting.At first I thought it would sound horrible because of Mudvaynes style, Which is why they are so good. But then I bought the C.D. and let me tell you was I supprized. They did an incredible job on this Mudvaynians will enjoy this as well would any classical listener. Don't beleve me? ""Not Falling"" This song alone will make you love this CD, Worth the money especially if your allready a fan!"
2,Disappointing,"Compared to the typical Autocourse title, this is a disappointing book. Some excellent photos is the only highpoint.Based on previous Autocourse titles, I expected a chronological approach to the subject with detailed race by race statistics and some technical discussion. Instead, the book covers the history of CART themematically with the bare minimum of driver stats and superficial technology comment.This book could have been so much more; but instead, it is a trivial recount of CART's history. Very disappointing. Not in the same class as other Autocourse titles."
2,A big disappointment,"Despite the claims made for this music, and the technical quality of the recording, I find it just a bit too uninteresting and unpleasant to listen to. In the same general area of delayed or looping or simply ethereal vocals, I'd prefer works by Gavin Bryars, Pauline Oliveros, Arvo Part, Steve Reich or even David Hykes' Harmonic Choir. I hate paying for and then physically cluttering up my CD rack with things I don't enjoy."
4,The Fonz Does It Again,"I had forgotten about this for 20 years and then while doing a routine search on Amazon a few years ago -- and not remembering the title -- I found it.I remember that soon after ""Happy Days"" went off the air, Henry Winkler was on ""The John Davidson"" talk show promoting it. My 4 year old watched it a month ago and was excited to see The Smurfs and Pac Man teaching him about being safe. I'd love for this to be put on DVD and revamped for the 21st century."
1,I do not recommend.,"I did spread these seeds in a garden in California.But, I did not find any sprout.It's difficult for me to germinate them."
4,Easy to plant Alyssum Flower seeds,These easy to plant seeds create a lovely carpet on hard to maintain steep banks on our property. We are very happy with the results and with the time between ordering and delivery.
5,SWEET ALYSSUM SEED,FREE SHIPPING. EXCELLENT. I USE ALYSSUM FOR MY HANGING BASKETS. THEY ADD A LOT OF CHARACTER AND FINESSE TO A GARDEN. LOVE THEM. WILL ORDER MORE FOR NEXT YEARS GARDENS. THIS COMPANY SHIPPED FAST. AND I APPRECIATED HAVING ALL MY SEEDS WITHIN A WEEK OR ORDERING SO I COULD MAP OUT WHERE WHAT WENT WHERE. AND I AM ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW MY PLAN WORKED. I RECCOMMEND THIS COMPANY HIGHLY.
1,WOW---Waste of money---0 stars,"I bought the audible version. It is not a book. It is a boring lecture. He talks about himself, about a car accident, answers questions from the audience. He talks about his other books, and about future lectures that will be about what we expect him to be talking about in this ""book"". It was 18 dollars for 54 minutes. I got ripped off. I hate being ripped off!"
3,Okay but not the greatest in the series,My daughter loves the lift flap books but definitely was not as into the story of this one compared to Katz's other books. It was nice to have one with daddy but doesn't keep her attention fixed.
2,Not my favorite,"I like the bright colors of this book, but I don't see it being a classic or even a regular read. It is about Daddy and where he keeps his tools."
2,Talk about sexist...,"I like some of her other books, but this one turned me off. In our house, Mommy and Daddy both know how to use tools. Is tools, sports, and beer (when they're older :) the only way for males to bond? I don't think so!"
3,"Should be called ""Daddy and Son""","Bought this for my husband to read to our daughter, but should have looked more carefully at the content because it's all about a little boy working with his dad on a project. Not really appropriate for father/daughter. Also, I do find that the flaps on these books are flimsy and hard to open."
3,Cute but flawed,Everytime I read this book I am irritated by the fact that the father and son start by first sawing the wood and then after that measuring it. I can't beleive the editors didn't catch this. Overall I think it is a cute book and my toddler loves it.
3,handymen,"This book was cute if the father you have in mind is handy around the house. Kind of a bummer for office type Dads who don't do this stuff. My son doesn't, so I will have to find someone else to give the book to."
5,Very nice and colorful book,I ordered a set of 4 Karen Katz books. This was one of them. My 9 month old son loves it. It is colorful and entertaining. Just the right amount of pictures and text for his age group.
5,Great Fathers Day Gift,I bought this as a gift from my son to his Daddy for Fathers Day and they both love it.
4,Lovely book!,"My daughter is only 11 months old, but she loves this book, (especially when her daddy reads it to her). Great book, great value!"
2,So Gender Biased and Stereotyped,"I don't know if we are just a strange a-typical family, but this whole daddy and me book was based on things that only mommy can do in our house- daddy doesn't even have any tools. I love Karen Katz books, but this story simply made us cringe. If you are a father who has a son and like to do stuff with you tools in the garage, then this book is for you."
2,Definitely not her best book.,"Eh, another ""Daddy has tools"" book- sexist, trite. There is nothing ""stand-out"" about the book- not the flaps, the artwork, the writing or the theme. We have a lot of the Katz books and I am much happier when my daughter brings me ""Where is Baby's Belly Button"" than any of the family-centered books, this one especially."
4,Excellent book with flimsy paper flaps,"All of Karen Katz's books are well written, cute stories with bright fabric inspired illustrations, however the flaps are VERY flimsy and can be torn off easily by little hands. The thin paper flaps are not durable at at all. Also, the flaps don't all open the same way so your little one must learn how to open each flap differently. Despite this, I still purchase more of her books since my 16 month son picks out Katz's books each day for storytime and enjoys them immensely."
2,katz fan but...,"My 14 month old daughter has loved Karen Katz's other books, such as ""Where is Mommy"" and ""Toes, Ears, and Nose,"" but ""Daddy and Me"" is a bit of a letdown. It just seems to fall short of the others, both in terms of the visual aspects of the book (not as colorful and cute as the others) and the story. It seems thrown together, and is the first Katz book we have been disappointed in."
5,Very Cute,Great book for father's to read to their children...especially if they work with tools. My daughter loves it.
5,GREAT BOOK about 1941 baseball season,"Unlike some boring secondary-source history books, Dom Dimaggio gives a riveting first-hand account of the 1941 baseball season. During the 1941 season, Joe Dimaggio recorded his 56 game hitting streak and Ted Williams hit .406. Dom Dimaggio has the great fortune of being the brother of Joltin' Joe and a close friend of Teddy Ballgame. Throughout the book, Mr. Dimaggio recalls his favorite moments and memories of his career playing for the Red Sox. Certainly, a must-read for any baseball fan that loves to learn about the history of the game!"
4,A year to match 98',"After the heroics of this past baseball season, it was a pleasure to read about one year in another era of the sport that also included monumental feats by star players. Joe dimaggio's 56 game hitting streak and Ted William's .406 batting average are records still waiting to be broken. Dom Dimaggio has brought us a view of 1941 that is unforgettable. He certainly did his homework as he quotes statistics and plays on the field in certain games as if they happened yesterday. He tends to repeat himself a bit and spends too much time on American history, but all in all a wonderful reminiscence of a great era."
1,dont buy this -Jult Warfell,"I had no high hopes for this series and true to my opinion, I was sadly dead on. Words cannot display how much time I invested watching this and its second half, not to mention the cabbage I wasted purchasing the two. -Jult Warfell"
1,very boring,"Too much narrative. Incongruent, and at times not believable. Overall a moderate-to-weak effort. Somewhat boring."
2,mild,"When you purchase a book like this one, you expect to buy the insides of a bizarre story. Instead, here you wind-up buying the Author's speculation. Thus your money goes."
1,not too hot,"My English teacher used to say: ""Writing, just like any other talent, doesn't happen by mistake."" Ugly style, lopsided, incoherent, lots of natter... gimme the FACTS! Where is the good old investigative reporting gone? This book is a mistake."
1,"dull, boring, banal, vapid",A dull book about a boring nebbish; 99% gossipy blah blah and 1% details; don't waste time or money on this.
2,what's going on here?,"While I found the book unenjoyable and rather dull, I'm giving it two stars because it did have some fresh information. But I am more intrigued by what is going on with these reviews. I have never seen a case where the reviews bounce back and forth -- 1 star, 5 stars, 1 star, 5 stars -- with all of the 5 stars coming from the same region, and written with the hyped tone of a publicist. Often, similar language is being used (SEX! When's the movie coming out?) Is somebody stuffing the ballot box here?"
2,"Somewhat boring, not fresh","I have followed the Frankel story on the news with great interest. This book, though, is somewhat unenjoyable and dull at times - it has not added anything new to the information already published in newspapers. This book is a rehash. Two stars."
3,eccentric thief,"This is a book well worth reading for anyone who loves rare crimes, especially of the white collar variety. For someone who took a real interest in this story as it unfolded in the media, the book recaps much of what has already been published in newspapers from New York to Frankel's hometown newspaper in Toledo, Ohio. But the book goes beyond what has been published before by helping to put in perspective the entire sordid chain of events. My only peeve is that the book lacks a solid bibliography to be a real authoritative work. The author does not cite his sources, but rather, gives a weak acknowledgment to the newspapers that be borrowed so heavily from. There's no shame in what he did, as long as he cites his references. Because I wrote a long and extensive term paper on this, I know where he drew his information from. But still, it's a compelling book and deserves to be read!"
5,A must have for the R&B lover,"Great voice, great songs. Get it..if you love R&B you will not be disappointed. A must have."
5,Base ten Starter Set Plastic Blue,"It's a great educational product. My only two complaints are the packaging and the activity guide. I thought it was going to include some kind of storage case, but it didn't. It just came in plastic bags. I'll just keep it in the cardboard box it came in, for now. The activity guide is one sheet of paper folded in half with few suggestions. I confused activity guide with activity book so I was disappointed when I saw the guide and not the book. Beside those two complaints, this product is great and I'm glad I made the purchase."
3,"Not bad, but not their best either.","This GLB release shows the band expanding their sound from the sparse, moody first three albums to a more brighter, uptempo sound here. Paul Kimble is gone, and I miss his prodction style. It's ok for the band to try new things, but not at the expense of their uniqueness. GLB sounded like no other band in the early to mid '90's, and on this album while still they have some fine songs, the sound is also more generic . If it wasn't for Phillps's distinctive voice, this version of GLB doesn't sound all that different from dozens of other pop-rock bands out there."
5,Bringing back Folk to the 90's,"I'm truly hooked on GLB. It was ""Testimony"" on the radio that made me go looking for this CD. This band makes me think of the ""New"" BAND. The folksie ""Come to Momma"" and ""Sanctuary"" makes me think of tunes that Dylan wishes he'd played. Hey, and I can understand these guys. I definitely felt like I have a piece of Americana, perhaps even from the Heartland when I'm listening to these tunes."
1,"Great Band, poor album","I have loved GLB since their first release. This album does nothing for me. If you want to hear the best of Grant Lee Buffalo, buy MIghty Joe Moon and Fuzzy. Mighty Joe is one of my top three albums for the 90's. GLB apparently need paul kimble back in order to reach the heights they once had. I'm sure people that visit this page are only hear because they like GLB and so you might all take offense to this snippet of information, but i want the new GLB fans to get their money's worth and but MIghty Joe Moon!"
4,Hard to believe it's been ten years,"This has been a favorite CD of mine since it came out in 1998, and it sure doesn't seem like 10 years have passed by. ""Truly Truly"" got all the airplay back then, but there's lots more to like here and the songs still sound fresh today (brilliant kickoff with ""APB"" and the rest is solid all the way through). Best of all this is a GREAT roadtrip CD, just pop this baby into your CD player, hit the highway and you're good to go!"
5,Great stuff,"Yep, I'm danish and did'nt know GLB before listen to him on the internetsite radio Paradise, and after buying ""Jubilee"" and expecially ""Mighty joe Moon"",- I'm convinced, thats not the last time looking for music on Amazon, simply grat music for relacs and being out of time, fore a stund."
4,the idey says this cd is good,"Grant lee phillips is one of the most talented artists around, more so than any of the pearl jammers, but, this album wasnt as good as Mighty Joe Moon or Copperopolis. Mighty was just an absolute masterpiece and copperopolis was so very genius, but this new record doesnt carry the emotional or sonic weight that the other ones did. Still a good record but just not a load of bricks."
5,Spiritual Maturity,"If you've read my reviews before, you know I think this author is awesome and truly filled with the Spirit of God, His Holy Spirit. This book is about maturing spiritually. In order for us to move to the next level we must die to self so that much fruit can be produced and seen in us. Take your time and read this book. If you don't get it at first, put it down go out side and plant something. Come back later and read again. You will be blessed."
5,towel holders,"These work great. I have them stuck under my counters all over my kitchen. An easy way to have the towels stay right where you need them when you are cooking. I hate hanging towels on the oven door (they always fall off) etc. I do wish they had free super saver shipping, but I guess this was worth it."
2,Broke after several months,"They stick very well to the rear of my cabinet door, but one broke after only a couple of months of use.We used it to hold a small wash towel. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.So I'm ordering moreInterDesign Steel Forma Towel Grabbers.Fortunately, when I had to remove the broken one, the adhesive came off cleanly."
5,Best Towel Holder Ever,I have had this towel holder before. It sticks. It stays stuck. It does the trick anywhere you put it. I hang it on my dishwasher and put a dishtowel in it. No amount of tugging will pull it off. That is what I was looking for.
3,IF you're careful,"If you don't stuff the towels in, it will last a very long time. Unfortunately, I don't live alone. It seems that men (and boys) are much less delicate in the way they place towels in the holder. After 6 months, my towel holder is still working great, even for beach towels. My husband's, grandson's, and the community hand-towel holders are broken down the center. I used super glue to fix them, but, alas...."
5,Great Alternative to Nails in your cabinet,"I didn't want to put nails in the kitchen cabinets by my sink and don't like the idea of hanging dish towels under the sink where I keep trash, so this seemed like a good solution. I applied the hangar upsdide down immediately below my cabinet so it's hardly noticable and pull down lightly on the towel when I need to grab it (vs a quick dry of my hands while it's hanging). Genius little product. Highly recommend."
4,Pleased with my Niece's present,The product was exactly what I wanted to give my Niece. It was especially wonderful that she could have a doll that looks like her! Thanks so much.
4,Healing,"Nobody captures love, loss and hope better than Linda. Her amazing ability to take these emotions and give them life truly is spectacular.My favorite's, Vole Mon Ange (Fly Away My Angel), When I Look At You, and the whimsical Storybook.Bravo Linda!>B."
2,repeat recordings,"This may be a great album, I don't know because I haven't heard it, as this album anyway. Eight of the 15 songs on this one are also on ""Linda Eder And So Much More"". I am very disappointed because usually I am thrilled when she has a new album. But I don't feel like paying for a new album where more than half of the songs are on an album I already have!!!!"
3,James Reed (ed) Border Ballads Fyfield 2003,"Nearly all the ballad texts in this selection are taken from Sir Walter Scott's 'Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border' (1802) and Scott was a known 'embellisher' of ballads. Reed gives no impression of the wide range of printed ballad texts, other than Scott's, or of their oral nature (see F J Child 'The English and Scottish Popular Ballads) A handy paperback, though, if you just want to read one version of a Border Ballad. Many exist in several versions, collected since Scott's day."
5,bmw 70 mm sticker,Looks exactly as original blue and white decal. Excellent product. Adhesive extremely strong and sticker decal bonded perfect. Will purchase again as needed.
4,"""Losing Joe's Place"" Found","I read this book several times at different ages and loved it every time. I have a friend who was suffering from potential ""executive burnout,"" and felt she could benefit from the wisdom of Rootbeer Racinette. I ordered it from Amazon and had it shipped directly to her home. Burnout avoided. I wish I had a set of all of Gordon Korman's books. Love the Bruno & Boots stories!"
2,losing Joes place,"After Joe's brother moved to his apartment bad things starts to happend. First they didn't have a job, and the worst is that his brother told him not to loose his place because it is the best apartment in the whole town.So would they loose the place, or would they keep it up until he comes from his vication? Hurry up you need to read the rest of it!"
5,Love the Dr!,"I couldn't think after I read the Thinks you can think. I just love all the Seuss books period! To rythmically write sentences that seem like they make no sense but when you read in between the lines sometimes two or three times, (like me) they do make sense you can't help but laugh!"
5,"Oh, I think this is a fun read!",Very fun to read. My toddler son enjoys hearing it. Can't go wrong with this Seuss title.
4,"Review on Oh,the thinks you can think","The book oh, the thinks you can think is about all the things you can think about when you have nothing to do. It is about things that Dr. Seuss has made up things that he has thought of at one time, I think this is a good book because it can help kids think of things or anything they want to be when their older, the book has good easy sentances to read it is really something to think about"
4,Great introduction to imagination (not thinking),"This is a wonderful book. It might not be the very best of Seuss, but it has all the trademark silliness and inventiveness, and very readable wordplay that is so attactive to so many kids. It's one of the simpler of the Seuss books, not as simple as ""Green Eggs and Ham"" but not as complex as ""Horton Hears a Who."" The theme of the book is imagination, and what you can think (dream) up. The littlest kids, who aren't yet engaging in pretend play and demonstrating their own rich imagination, might not get the message, but they'll still appreciate and learn from the language."
2,So many other wonderful Seuss books to read first,"I love, love, love Dr. Seuss. Always have and I think I always will.Sadly, this book didn't live up to many of my other favorites. The rhymes weren't smooth (sometimes it didn't even rhyme). And while the ""made-up"" words were cute, they felt more like a way to make a rhyme than anything else.I liked the illustrations, I *love* the idea, and parts of it did make me smile. But mostly it just felt like a rough draft.Thankfully there are so many fantastically wonderful Seuss books out there, that there's plenty of his works to read before this one ;)-ETA- Obviously plenty of others loved this book! So, perhaps it was just the mood I was in when I read it...?"
2,Scroll Function Is Dying,"After a year of use, the scroll function on the mouse is dying. It barely scrolls anymore and is going to have to be replaced soon. I'm disappointed that this mouse lasted only one year. I would not recommend buying this one."
2,sticking buttons after 6 months,"I replaced my Microsoft Optical Mouse with the MX 310 and initially felt very happy with my decision. The Logitech has a much more solid feel with more precise control. After 6 months the right mouse button started to stick and more recently the left button would intermittently require more force to click. It has become extremely annoying having to consciously push the mouse buttons each time, almost like having to push hard on a pen top to get it to unsheath.I wrote to Logitech with my problem and they said to bring it to a service center. I'm going to bring it back to Best Buy and see if they'll fix or replace it."
3,A little smaller.,"Technically, the mouse works great so far. But compared to my Kensington Mouse-In-A-Box Optical Pro <ASIN: B00004YMY5>, it's a bit small for my hand. If I am in a posture where my hand is resting on the mouse, the heel of my palm is dragging on the mouse pad. With my arm extend more, that's less of a problem, but even then my thumb and little finger (nestled in the ergonomic grooves on the sides of the mouse) brush against the mouse pad if I'm not careful to move them a little higher."
4,Mouse makes it easy to be productive,"Logitech's leap towards enhancing the the fabrication of these ""human interface devices"" (as they are known by Windows XP) has become an ongoing legacy for their consumers. Their latest release in the mouse community is the new MX310. This mouse boasts the latest Logitech MX Optical Engine (present in all Logitech ""MX"" branded optical mousing devices). In addition these enhanced mice also contain a quick switch program selector, convenient internet navigation buttons (forward and backward), a high precision scroll wheel and it is designed for both right and left handed users. It sounds pretty well rounded, but is it up to snuff; will it stand up to the extreme user? (Full review @ bytesector.com)"
1,WOW ITS BEEN ONLY...... ONE MONTH?,"If your a hardcore gamer, i would not recommend this mouse. After a month of intensive training in CS Source, the MX310 stoped working properly. The LED turns on and off, jamming your curser every 5 seconds, making it EXTREMELY ANNOYing to use my computer in general. What i really dislike is the ""Technical Service."" They give a number that doesn't work and that most likly is located in India. Never again Logitch, im sticking with Microsoft."
5,Great mouse,I just upgraded from a Microsoft Wireless Intelimouse Explorer and could not be happier. The mouse fits my hand like a glove. Over all the buttons are all very well placed for me and the precision is unmatched. I could have bought the more expensive MX 500 but they have the same exact optical engine. The only difference is design. What a great mouse.Logitech has always done a great job
1,Horrible ergonomics,"I can't stand the feel of this mouse. It's so long and flat that it doesn't fit into the natural curvature of the hand's resting position. If you're an NBA basketball player with gorilla hands it will be a perfect fit. The thumb and pinky grooves are too rigid forcing you to keep wrist parallel to desk, not angled up as usual. Precision is decent, not great and buttons response is inconsistent. I'm returning this mouse in favor of a Microsoft ""egg"" shape mouse. For the price, this mouse should be wireless as well..."
2,Carpal Tunnel is setting in...,"Wow, I think I developed Carpal Tunnel in less than 2-days with the MX310. Outside of that, I think with the new SetPoint software installed (over MouseWare) it's a good mouse...especially for $20. But, mine will be going back because it is very rough on the wrist. I've got a gel mouse pad with wrist support and I even tried the MX310 without the pad...no luck, still rough on the wrist."
5,Best mouse I've ever used!,"I purchased the MX-310 to replace a Microsoft cordless that had been flaking out on me.I am very happy to be back to a corded mouse. No more problems with wireless signal or batteries.This mouse has such a great feel! I love it more every time I use it.Excellent quality, and priced well."
4,New Taste,I listened to music that has long been overdue from a talented Artist. This man should be with the right folks to move up but at least the Talent is still there. Missy/Timberland or Keith are you listening? I loved (10) of the songs! I am a musician and can appreciate a good put together package.
1,couldn't purchase,"I'm looking for one of these, I think this is it but the author of the description has decided to list 1x1x1 inches as the size instead of the actual size of the hood. I'm unable to tell if it's the correct one for my tank. the inside top of my tank is 16 1/2"" and the outside edge is 18"". a hood that is 1"" across obviously will not fit."
5,Great Quality,This was the only thing i could find to fit my 27 gal hex tank. I was very impressed with the quailty and durability. I have had it for 3 months without any problems. This is the best thing I could have bought for the tank.
4,good purchase,Band arrived on time and is a proffesional style band. Far better than any I have encountered at any sports shop or drug store.
5,Excellent when used with a DVD I also purchased,"I have used several arm bands for tennis elbow and this one is the best. I like it because it applies pressure to the areas that need it, but does not cut off your circulaton like the others. It will not cure tennis elbow, but I there is a DVD available that does cure the problem at [...]"
2,Seemed to help but broke in 5 days,Length:: 0:29 MinsAfter a shower I was putting this back on my arm and as I tightened the velco strap .. Pop .. the plastic loop that the Velcro wraps around broke. Either I got a dud or the quality is a bit shoddy. It's a shame because it seemed to be helping my tennis elbow but now I am left with nothing. See video to what happened.
5,Design Theory,"I entered the field of industrial design about 40 years ago with a shiny new degree from Art Center, considered then as now, a top school in the field. I was taught nothing worth mentioning about design theory, and indeed there seemed little in print at that time that was worth knowing . It's difficult to write down a set of rules that can be used to understand and create good design. Del Coates has taken a good bash at it. I wish I'd had a book like this when I started my career. Better yet, I wish my bosses had read such a book. I hope others will build on what Del has started."
4,LAUDABLE SONGS BUT INSUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERIZED,"A distinguished collection of Skynyrd's best works. Sweet Home Alabama, What's Your Name, That Smell and Down South Jukin' all fit the bill perfectly. Has included also the classic Tuesday's Gone, an acclaimed track not arranged with say the Skynyrd's Innyrds compilation. Only thing that could have been improved upon is if Gimme Three Steps, I Ain't The One and Free Bird had been classified (Live) on the CD label cover. Don't think would have been that substantial an effort by MCA to let potential buyers become aware or familiar with such song details. Free Bird sounds effective in this crowd interactive mode, but as another reviewer claimed, Gimme Three Steps especially would have been more ideal as done in its studio-recording format. I neither favor nor denounce I Ain't The One, so its energy-acoustic Live rendition didn't pose that great a difference/impact to me..."
1,not what i expected,i ordered this 2 cd and only got one. the company that i ordered this from never got back to me to rectify the problem. try listening to the cd. when you are missing cd 1 and only got cd 2. if the company cannot solve the problem i will never suggest this company to my friendsz and family. i have been trying to get this problem fixed for 2 months now. they will not contact me or return my money.. amazon is trying to contact this 3rd party company to fix the situation. amazon wants there customers to be happy.
2,"Only one disc, should have been two",I received this product in a timely manner. It is my fault for not opening it up and playing it right away. It was several months before I opened and played it. There was only one disc included. It is a two disc set. Of course it was too late to return it.
4,Good intro to Skynrd,"This is a fun party album, though not comprehensive. It's a good intro to the band and has several of their big hits."
3,Not Skynyrd's best...,"I'm not sure why this album is a double-disc (probably because of the 14-minute version of Free Bird), but it only has eight tracks on each disc. Given the basic premise (a collection of their most successful releases), the album is solid. However, several of their better, less-known songs like ""The Ballad of Curtis Lowe"" are excluded. The highlight of the album is ""Simple Man,"" which I consider to be their best song.If you're looking for the best Lynyrd Skynyrd greatest hits album (from among the dozens that have been released over the years), keep looking. But if you just want a solid collection of some of their most famous work, this album does the job."
2,2 stars,i am very unhappy with my product. there was supose to be two cds i the set. there was only one.
4,Remembering the '50s,"Wonderful album by the Four Aces and these are the original Aces (beware of the current group of different performers). As this is an album, not a CD, remember condition is critical. This is an outstanding collection of standards by one of the great singing groups of all time, led by Al Alberts. Their recording of Heartaches on this record is the best version of that great song that I have ever heard. And the album cover is beautiful and wonderfully evocative of the 1950s. I highly recommend it."
5,Easily the best book on this subject that I am aware of.,"This book is excellent and a must for anyone who wants to learn about what language program administrators should be doing. Having worked for several language programs, I can tell you just how much the managers of these programs could have benefited from reading this handbook and following their advice.I know that a new edition will be out soon with some of the chapters updated. I'd highly recommend checking it out."
3,Ok but really basic,This was ok but it was really very basic. I was surprised it didn't get into or cover any cleaning and maintenance directions. Knowing what I know I wouldn't have purchased just not complete enough.
4,Guitar Setup & Maintenance,"ReceivedGuitar Setup & Maintenance - Instructional Guitar DVD With Denny Rauenin a few days. Provides useable info on setting up & maintaining various styles of guitars, i.e.:AcousticElectricJazzSlideEasily understandable explanations of string changing, truss rod adjustment and more. DVD is worth the higher price found on other sites but via, Amazon; icing on the cake."
5,An excellent mystery that's hard to put down,"This is an excellent mystery novel. It's full of unexpected twists and turns, and leaves you guessing up until the end. Caroline's sense of humor and tendency to be accident prone make her character seem all the more real. Once you start reading the book, it's almost impossible to put down."
5,A fan from all the way in Ireland,"I got this album back in Christmas from a friend of mine. Since listening to it, that friend has been spolit rotten in gratitude...Shame they havent hit the U.K. market, but it's only a matter of time..."
5,"A SUPERJESUS FAN IN ALBANY,GEORGIA",After seeing the video for Down Again on Mtv 2 I bouught the album. The album is nothing short of breathtaking. The lyrics are from the heart and Sarah Mcleod's voice is awesome. The band has a sound all their own and it is well worth the money.
5,"This CD is fantastic, every track is superbly done.",I bought the Superjesus's album when it was first released and I have seen them play live twice. They are a fantastic band that very well live and you can never get tried of there songs. I really recommend getting this one.
3,More Western Oriented,"This album is more disco/pop oriented than Anna Vissi's earlier albums,which I personally prefer.Maybe this is designed to attract a world audience in addition to merely Greek fans.In fact it puts me in mind of Despina Vandi's ""Gia"".Who can say:however it will backfire for those who prefer impeccably played authentic Greek instruments and top quality sound,which this album doesn't have.[you do get the odd fuzzy sound of a bouzouki thrown in at times just so you don't forget that this IS a Greek album.]I suppose it all depends on your musical taste.I can't help feeling that Anna is turning into a Greek version of Madonna.If that's what the fans want,well that's fine by me,but count me out in future.I'll stick with Natassa Theodoridou.You'd be better off buying her previous double album,KRAVGI,which is far better than this one:really first class in fact."
3,I was misled ...,"These are not the legendary duo recordings of Big Joe Turner and Pete Johnson, in fact, except for about six tunes, Big Joe and Pete do not appear together at all on this very expesnive two disc set. What this does have are some fine jump blues performances by Turner, and a 1946 concept album by Johnson with cameos by such luminaries as Ben Webster and Hot Lips Page. But the packaging clearly gives you the impression that Johnson and Turner will be heard performing together and except for those few songs they don't. Big Joe is my favorite blues singer, because of the sheer strength of his voice and his intimations of evil. (""Fish love in the water, worms love in the ground, rats make love in the garbage can, and you can't put me down."") So any recordings by him, especially in a pre- rock and roll setting, make great listening. But I wish the record company could have been a little more honest about what they were selling. Five stars for Big Joe and one for Savoy."
3,Somewhat Emasculated,"I guess after all that horrid Nazi business, it has become majorly politically incorrect to do German military music that sounds like, well, German Military Music - in other words the kind of stuff that would inspire young Rhinelanders to romp & stomp their way to Paris.Anyway that is the impression I got after listening to this CD. It just lacks the ""kick"" that I look for in military music (which I mostly listen to kick myself in the butt when I workout)Instead it sounded to me more like middle aged men playing in an ompa band outside a hoffbraugh.Nevertheless as ompa music it is well done and if you are looking for that this CD is a good choice. But I rate it a 3 since it is advertised as Military Music.A better recording, if you can find it, is ""Prussia's Glory"" - World War 1 era German military music with all the punch."
2,Lacks any power or kick,"Forget this record. I expect my German military marches to be played with vim, vigor and possible violence, this band is way too tame. It sounds like an arthritic Perry Como wannabe is directing the group. It's not a military orchestra, this is some dingy oom-pa-pa band assembled in the basement of the Augustinerkeller (if you know Munich, you'll get that joke). The marches are played much too slowly and there isn't the necessary urgency or dynamism here. There is also no vocalizing and the song selection is dismal. Where is ""Westerwald?"" Where is ""Wenn Wir Marschieren??"" A crushing disappointment in song selection, style and presentation!"
2,Not so very weird,"I don't know why he would call this book really, really, really, really, weird stories. The stories are ok and the writing not so bad. But not worth reading."
1,You Gotta be Kidding!,"Is the listed price really $9,999.30. I guess I'd better buy a whole bunch because they must most certainly be something special. Soinds like a government procurement to me. That's something they would do in the Pentagon."
4,Sandisk 1GB Cruzer Micro,The Sandisk Cruzer come equipped with the U3 Smart system.This allows you to place programs on your flash drive.This flash drive performs very well.The only downside is the lack of protective casing.It is encased in plastic that if not careful can break.Buyer Beware!There are many recorded cases of the U3 software not working right.There are also some known Compatibility issues with MAC Computers.
3,Good for background anyway,"While I've been following the series avidly, I was a little disappointed in Bloodlines. The storytelling wasn't up to par on this particular installment - The Brothers' War and Time Streams were both excellent reads, but that should probably be expected when a different author writes each new installment of the series. While Bloodlines did a fairly good job of tying everything together and finishing the detailed history of Urza's struggle against Phyrexia, the events in the book didn't have as much coherence as in the past - they stayed separate, never came together to form an overarching story.For those who felt the story was left incomplete - it was! The history of the Urza-Phyrexia war has been told, but the battle continues in the novels ""Rath and Storm"" and ""Mercadian Masques."" The Artifacts Cycle is a story in itself, but it is also the background for the current events described in these books."
3,Decent addition,"I liked the story for what it was, but the continuity seemed to be a little off from the previous books and the Bloodlines idea seems little stupid. Even if you are a planeswalker with lots of time on your hands, why would you create a weapon based on generations of humans? I just don't get it. But, in the end, we do get many of the characters that populate the MTG universe and turnout good stories. So at the very least it is good back ground info."
3,difficult read - demands very hard concentration,"Although it is an important part in the entire story about Urza's Legacy and the Weatherlight stories to follow, it demands a lot of concentration to connect the different story-threads that range over a vast period of time, making huge leaps by decades & centuries"
3,Why was this book written anyway?,"Within the story line of the ARtifact Cycle, I was expecting something more substantial. I think it's a weak link between this cycle and the Weatherlight's.But besides this, it's a good story."
3,Hoyt has wigged out,"Richard Hoyt is an excellent writer -- he could write a good book in his sleep and he appears to have done so. Or if not in his sleep, then possibly stoned out of his gourd. I can't think of any other reason why he would have written such a pointless non-mystery. Or why he would have made such stupid geographical errors as putting Oregon north of the Columbia River or driving to Medford on I-84. And the only way it takes 24 hours to drive across Oregon is if you're too stoned to drive over 30 mph.Pony Girls is quite readable and even enjoyable, if you think the journey is everything and the destination doesn't matter. I've been a fan of Hoyt for years, but my advice is to go back and read his early work, when the mysteries were mysteries and the plots made sense."
3,okay,3 Stars is all I got 2 give. I felt this story needed an extra added touch 2 bring it over the edge. I wanted something more and I didn't it get 4rm this story.
3,"Okay, for what it does","The Princeton Review's approach to test preparation is to guide you in psyching out the testers. Their statistics show that their approach is successful in improving test scores, and with the emphasis given to SAT scores, that isn't so bad. But for my own part, I'd rather do well on a test because I've got a good understanding of the material being tested.Note that the Princeton Review strategies work only for the paper SAT. They don't work at all if you're taking the computer version."
4,I bought it!,"I have bought this book and all it teaches you is how the system of the SAT works its only useful for SAT test only.When i first bought it i though it was kind of like to study for the SAT.But the techniques are wonderful, no question about that.A really good book for improving your scores though."
4,good for final review,"as the previous PR PREPs, it's a well-looking and interesting book.it has 7 SAT model tests, 3 inside the book, and the others are in the CD which attached in that book.i love that disc, you may take the model tests with your PC, and you may soon get the score after finishing it....it's coolbut it's not enough for preparing SAT i think, you may need more about particular sections you don't know well...."
3,Still Less Than Impressive,"Once again I find myself torn on how much I actually like xxxHolic. While the characters are continuing to encourage curiosity on what will ultimately happen to them, I'm still not excited to see more. With its very slow story pacing and yet more overreliance on sight gags, xxxHolic has so far not lived up to the hype. With the second half now completely underway though, the series has at least earned enough passing notice to pull me in for the rest. Recommended but with very little enthusiasm."
5,Love it,"I always end up getting a few compliments when I wear this one. It can go casual or formal, good size, great price."
1,No Ending...don't bother reading it!,If my one line review wasn't enough I suggest you read it and find out the truth for yourself
3,Great product - if only it had worked with my Bose Lifestyle 12 II,"I bought this product based on its great reviews and some comments on Amazon that it works with Bose Lifestyle systems. The setup was straight forward, put the CD and install the software. The software will ask you questions by which you can setup your activities (Watch DVD, etc..).I have a Vizio TV and I did not see it on the list but it worked when I select another company that starts with V. However my Bose system failed to power up and I use Bose home theater as audio output for all activities. So it did not make sense to keep it for such a high price. Returned it to Amazon and got a refund."
2,frustrating,"The remote works! However I had to return this rmote for a replacement.After several attempts to download setup & 30 minutes with customer support (no help) I noticed the ""clear button"" was sticking. After clearing this ""stuck button"" the remote did everything I wanted.However it continued to stick,so it was returned. This trouble should have been ""noted"" my customer support."
5,Greatest universal remote,"Great remote, easy to set up. Has done everything I have expected it to do. Works better than a $700 remote that came with my receiver. Highly recommended."
4,Great remote with a long term drawback,"This is a wonderful remote, it controls my entire home theater system, projector, XBOX (though limited to the XBOX functions) and my XBOX360. It is simple to set up and can be used within minutes of opening. I recommend a high-speed internet connection though for online programming.The only drawback is the connection to the charging dock. This comes only after a few years of normal use, the springs on the connectors wear and don't make perfect contact. I solved this by elevating the back end of the dock and let it charge over night. Works perfect."
1,Item meant for very advanced users,"Logitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote ControlThis product is extremely difficult to program. And it constantly turns off the TV when I try to use the help button, which they tell you to use.I have called the help number for the remote and do not get answers that are usable. They treat you like you are a dummy, but it is ok if you spend a lot of your hard earned money on a product that only frustrates you. I'm a middle of the line computer user and have gotten 3/4th of the items I have to use programed but to my frustration the last one is killing me. When it turns off my TV I have to wait for the green light to go off to be able to turn it back on again and then it is using the life of the light faster and they are very expensive. I would never recommend this product to anyone but an expert on technological products.The company is very unresponsive to any problems that you have."
1,"Waste of money - should be 0 stars, but that's not an option.","Easy enough to upload equipment information & program, but the '1 press activity button' fails to correctly turn on the required components/settings 90% of the time. You end up hitting 'help' button and running thru a menu of 'yes/no' questions until the correct configuration is reached. The contacts for charging the remote are too recessed...the remote has to placed in the cradle just right or no contact is made. I end up using the OEM remotes half the time. Another thing: this remote doesn't duplicate OEM functions very well, in particular - Sony CD Jukebox - I programmed the 880, but the button options don't appear onscreen...the OEM remote is much easier to use. I wouldn't mind too much if this was a $50 remote, but for $175, it's a total waste. (If you spent over $200, you have too much money and should send some to me)"
5,A GOOD CONTROLER,I HAVE THE 880 THE 885 AND 2 1000 LOGITECH HARMONY REMOTES THE 880 AND 885 ARE GREAT THE BEST WORKS VERY WELL HAD THE 2 880 AND 885 FOR 2YEARS VERY HAPPY.
4,Harmony 880,I Love this product. I replaces about 5 different remotes that I had lying all over the house. Definite addition
2,about 75% functional,"Easy to get about 3/4 of the way to fully functional. As an electronics engineer, I've dealt with all levels of both software and hardware. The Logitech software is terrible, and I think is the major flaw with the 880."
1,not worth the money,"After 3 hours of trying to set this up, it was good at turning on and off the systems that were programmed in along with the main subject (like DVD player so on) but to do anything else it took many steps to do any normal adjustments, and if you are in any other area, besides the first menu you can't adjust the sound and I had a hard time trying to get back to the first menu, without turning off everything and starting over. I would be more than willing to pay this much for a device that I could control all of my systems, but it would have to be easy to use. I have like the other product that I have had from Logitech, but I don't think that this is a winner."
1,Junk,"Great concept, poor execution.First, the buttons are too small and poorly laid out. The programming interface is a kludge, making it difficult to set up beyond the bare bones functions.Even that would be passable but the worst is the cradle/charging system: it's crap. After two weeks, the remote charges for 10 seconds, then shuts off. Of course to even get the stupid thing to charge for 10 seconds, you have to put on brick on it so it will make contact with the cradle.Eventually, the battery completely dies and you're left with an expensive piece third world slave labor."
1,Could be great but!,I like everything about this remote except the fact that it doesn't work for long. I have had two now and both have not lasted longer than about a year! Enough said!
2,Would not recommend...,"Sufficient programability, but I had reliability problems. Had mine for barely a year, and several buttons stopped working. I called tech support, and they nicely enough shipped me a replacement unit. I have used the replacement for less than a day, now the ""Prev"" button on the replacement is not working. WTH!! I think their contact switch style buttons are inferior to the field effect ones found on cheaper units.Looking for another brand now... :("
3,Quality control is poor,Pros:- Device works as advertised when you first get it.- Programmability is straightforward- supporting both PC and Mac.- Device definitely does simplify complex AV control.Cons:- After a year of use some of the buttons began to lose contact (channel up and down). I started reprogramming a different set of buttons to do the same action. Also some of the number keys start to lose contact as well.- It does not appear to be able to properly recharge now- not entirely sure if it's because of the tiny recharging contacts or some internal circuit malfunction.
3,"Very nice, but poor hardware quality causes failure after 1 year (out of warranty)","This remote is really great, when it works.Pros: This remote is easy to program, easy to use, and the web setup is amazing.Cons: Unfortunately the hardware is not as good as the software and user interface design. My first unit had to be returned because the tilt sensor quit. Both units I have owned are VERY finiky in the charger. Sometimes it just doesn't want to make contact and charge. Worst of all, after about a year, the buttons don't work nearly as well as when it was new. I searched online and this is a common problem. After your 1 year is up the maker will only fix it for $$$I really like the product. The user interfaces are easy and very powerful. It's a shame the hardware is nowhere near as well done."
5,Logitech Harmony 880,"Outstanding resource to combine all remotes into one handset. Easy to set up and to use. Surround sound, TV, DVR, TIVO, DVD, VCR all controlled with one remote; couldn't ask for more!"
1,Remote failed after 28 months,"I purchased the 880 from Amazon in November of 2007. For the past few months, I've had to angle the remote in the charging cradle for it to charge, but now it won't charge at all. Customer Service will offer me a 50% off coupon for a new remote, but these things aren't cheap and I had expected a much longer lifespan of the product. I love how easy it is to program and use, but I don't know if I want another one."
5,Best Programable Remote,This is one of the best investments I have ever made. My son told me I needed one to get rid of all of the remotes for Home Theatrer. It was not inexpensive but well worth the money. Programming is done on the computer no button or codes to figure out. It works great and you will be glad you bought one.
2,Harmony 880,"Consistancy of control is very poor and unacceptable. With this you would still need orginal remote control. Very often, I need to keep hitting Help button until I get to where I want! This is good for turning power on and off essentially. Key pad is too small and very hard to push.Will I recommend this for anybody? No!"
1,Stay away from this POS,"For channel surfers or folks who switch channels by punching numbers by feel, this is a useless POS. The button layout stinks. The memory in controlling multiple devices sucks as sometimes when you hit ""watch PVR"" and it should turn both the TV and PVR on, only one device comes on and you have to screw around turning the one off and retrying etc.The battery doesn't last long either. Complete waste of money, sorry I bought it, but goes a long way when hit with a 3 iron."
1,"Great idea, but...","I've had the Harmony 880 for two years and when it works it's great. The rest of the time it's an expensive doorstop. The main problems are battery recharging and upgrades.The battery charging cradle is very persnickety, so it's possible to place the remote in the cradle and miss the charging spots. The result is a dead battery instead of a fully charged one.The other problem is the difficulty in upgrading the remote. The Logitech Remote software hangs at 3% and never upgrades the unit. No firmware upgrades, no updates to equipment. If you don't get the programming right on the first try, forget it."
2,Great remote with a poor battery and poor cradle station design,"If you know what an USB plug on your computer is, it's a haven to set it up and use it. So, even a 6 -year old can figure out what to do with it.BUT the good life lasts for about a year, as, progressively, the battery is retaining less and less charge after each charging cycle.I don't know if this was caused by the cradle (poor design for the contacts) or the battery itself (even worse, mine it looks like it's ready to burst at any time).So be prepared to buy yourself a new battery every year, cause otherwise, it's not going to work for more than 3 minutes, when the battery goes bad. ANNOYING isn't it. A new battery is everywhere from $20 to $30 or you can place a bid on eBay for ~$15, but who knows what you'll get in terms of quality.Summary, great remote, with a CREEPY battery, good luck"
2,Dosen't Last,"I have had two Logitech remotes. Their features are great, they are easy to program and when they work right they can't be beat. The only thing is, THEY DO ARE NOT DURABLE - THEY DON'T LAST. Look elsewhere."
1,Extremely Delicate,"I dropped this remote off my lap, caught it between my calves, then it fell the rest of the way to the floor. It cracked - totally dead.After some friendly persistence on my part the Logitech people finally sent me a new one for a small repair fee.But I still haven't opened it. The human interface is bad -- small buttons, hard to read, needed multiple clicks even to do what you programmed. I guess it appeals to people who are used to the clunky world of the PC. As a Mac user I expect a TV remote that is also user friendly."
5,Logitech Harmony 880 Universal Remote,An excellent product. I was worried if it would be able to access all the functions of my DVR Cable box and my Panasonic Surround Sound System. No problem. It works beautifully. I have gone from three remotes to one and I will never go back. Thank you Logitech.
4,great remote,This was simple to set up and it works like a charm. My only complaint is that when working the DVR buttons you have to take the long road with doing some of the functions and there is a bit of a delay. So when I set up some shows to be recorded I still take out my old remote for that. Other than that is is so nice to have one remote that does it all.
5,"Buy this, or it's big brother!","Love, love, love this remote! Easy to set up. Everything works as its supposed to. With a big home theatre system, there is no more fiddling making sure the TV is on the right input, and the receiver is on the right input, the dvd player is on.... yada yada yada.... The thing just works. If you have a problem, push the help button. The activity based menu makes this very user friendly. We had a couple come and house sit for us recently, and I didn't have to write a thousand page manual for them just to watch TV! It just works."
2,Not nearly as good as it can be,"I have had my Logitech remote for over a year and my comments are as follows. The battery charges fine, but if you forget to put it in at night, it may not work in the morning. It frequently does not turn everything on or off properly, so I have to go to the help menu and answer several questions to get everything working properly. This probably happens half of the time that it is used. The worst problem that I have is that the 0 button works intermittently. I have had to pop the battery cover off a few times to reset the unit as it got locked up and nothing else would work. The battery cover is extremely hard to remove and I feel like I am ready to break the unit before it pops.Overall, I would not buy this unit again and not recommend it to anyone."
1,Recharging cradle a fatal flaw,"I liked this product, for awhile. It worked well, for awhile. Recharging it became increasingly more challenging. It slowly required ever more complex efforts to balance and adjust it in the cradle (put a coaster under the bottom end, just the right amount, and twist just ever so slightly to the right, then don't touch or jiggle it even slightly and it would recharge - get the idea?) Now it has completely failed to recharge. You'll see similar complaints in other reviews for this item.So, Logitech, here is how I function as a consumer: when I see a company that has a design flaw in a product, and they don't do anything to reach out to fix the product (remember - I registered in order to set it up?)that's the last chance you get. No more Logitech products in any category."
2,avoid like the plague,"This remote has a few nice features - LCD screen, online web interface, but I experienced major issues with this product.The recharging cradle didn't easily fit the remote - I had to use a weight on top of the remote to properly charge.A little after 1 year of mild to moderate use, my remote's infrared transmitter dies out. Now I can't use the remote at all.Finally, the remote doesn't allow much tweaking in the setup. The way my receiver is set up, I have to select DVD, then CD input to get sound and watch a DVD. The 880 remote would only pick DVD, then I have to manually select the CD input.Overall, I think this is an overrated remote. Beware the faulty hardware, as in my case the failing IR transmitter, which died out just after the warranty expired."
1,"Buttons too small, not an ergonomic device","Overall the remote works well.It is a bit slow to send commands to your equipment, ie there is a lag. THe result is you may push the button too many times.The buttons are way too small. I have skinny fingers and I can never find the buttons. They are laid out in a way to make the remote look cool, but they are not functional. The egonomics on my Dish DVR remote is much better.Consider getting a different version of the remote that has bigger keys and a better layout.2 year UPDATE: the volume button is failing. the display is failing. the remote does not sit well in the charging cradle, thus you may not get a charge. I plan to buy a different (no frills) version of this remote.FINAL REVIEW. Battery died, buttons failed. This thing was a $250 p.o.s. I wish could change the number of stars, but I cant. it would get a zero"
3,"The remote had great features, but wasn't durable",I've since moved on to a Harmony One and that's probably why I'm lowering the rating on this. it's a good remote that has a lot of programming options for it.
2,NOT AS ORDERED,Battery cover was broken and would not fasten. Chronic problem with this design. Logitech should redesign the battery cover with more robust fasteners.
3,Great remote. Awful charging system.,"There are thousands of documented cases on the Internet of this remote failing to charge after a while, and I can attest to the same. It's unfortunate, because otherwise this might be the perfect remote. Logitech has apparently redesigned the remote because of the charging issue. For others with this problem, I'd suggest reading the suggestions on this thread: [...]I'm buying an external battery charger and two additional batteries to see if that will work better than the charging cradle (which doesn't work much at all). Just search Amazon for ""Logitech 880 battery charger""."
1,Poor reliability!,I have owned this remote for slightly more than one year. The first unit failed within a few months and after a lot of aggravation I received a replacement. After using this replacement for approximately 8 months it's failed too. The remote worked well initially but the quality control and product durabilty are questionable at best. This remote has not seen any hard use nor has it ever been dropped yet it has failed again just outside of the warranty period. If you must have this item buy an extended warranty as you're going to need it.
5,Logitech 880 remote,I ourchased this product to replace three remotes. I was very pleased at the ease of setup and the over all operation of this remote. I would recommend this remote.
4,It works!,"My husband loves this remote. I was wary, because of the price tag, but he figured it would pay for itself in 10 months on battery savings. We were up to 4 remotes.You really do just pick it up, point it at your system, and tell it what you want to do. No more trying to figure out which buttons to push!The only downside is that it doesn't control our game system - that you still have to turn on manually."
5,Great-so far,This is a great remote. Almost all commands were there after I entered my equipment info. I did have to call support twice to get everything I wanted but they were very helpful and polite. Time will tell if it lasts without problems. I replaced four remotes with just one.
4,Good remote,"I liked the layout of the remote and bright screen, but had trouble setting it up with Logitech/Harmony web site."
2,Great until it started to die!,"I really like the harmony remotes and I plan to buy another one, however, I will buy the less expensive models like the 670 or 510 because the 880 died on me slowly. The buttons, particularly the most used buttons like volume started to require a lot of effort for them to work, then it became a nuisance to use the remote at all. I don't know if any other vendors remotes that will make life as easy for us to control our many A/V devices. So, my word of caution is buy different (less expensive) models, so when they die it cost less to replace. Keep in mind the 510 only controls 5 products, but for most people that's all they'll need."
3,An OK Universal Remote,"First off, it does what it says [three stars]. You can combine all your remotes into one. I have worked on JP1 remotes [but am not an expert] for several years. I found programming the 880 to be far different from the hoops a JP1 remote can be do [it might be the programmer], even at the basic level. Part of my problem was I knew what I wanted the remote to do, but could not find instructions on how [that does not mean the remot couldn't perform those tasks, I was impatient in the research process [the Harmony web site did not appear to have the answers].Also I found the buttons to be very small and close together. I ended up going back to the JP1 [Atlas remote]. Now I have a $100 880 settting on the shelf replaced by a $20 JP1."
4,Finally no more calls @ work askin how to turn on my TV,Controls a plethora of devices all around the house. Activities guide anyone even your 96 old grandma on how to watch TV with minimal help which comes from the remote itself. Customizable. One warning it will take a couple hours to configure everything to 100% of the way you want everything.
4,"Very Solid Remote, Great Logitech Support, OK Ergonomics","To keep this brief - Logitech support is excellent once you get to tier 2. They helped me configure this to work with my Messiah PS3 remote. I can't control power, but everything else the Messiah did the 880 will do.All in all, I've consolidated 6 remotes to one (with the exception again of powering on/off my PS3).It's very easy to update and configure, and I'm able to maintain all my controls available on the original remote.The only 2 negatives are the ergonomics and slow start up. The buttons for the cable box control for changing channels are placed oddly at the bottom of the remote. Tough to quickly change channels and control the guide or DVR.I still HIGHLY recommend the remote. I haven't tried the Harmony One, but I've heard from a friend it's better for feel. Either way, it's worth the money and makes using the HT easier."
3,"Good remote, but faulty buttons","The setup for this remote is simple in Mac OS X. With a little tweaking, it was controlling 5 different components fairly well. The first unit I got actually had 4 broken number pad buttons, but the replacement unit is fine. Amazon's return/replacement process was easy and quick, as usual. Highly recommend this remote."
5,Excellent Remote,"This remote has indeed proven itself to be a great one stop remote for my electronic devices. Finding obscure devices like my cable box by visionetics was a breeze and even my wife's 5+ year old Aiwa bookshelf system was extremely easy.Cons:Not sure why one must log into the net etc to do relatively simple things which I would think could be done offline.The remote has a relatively narrow ir field so you must insure that you are pointing at the device(s) directly.Otherwise, this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone. In fact I did and bought one for a friend."
3,Great concept poor execution,"This is a wonderful product with some limitations. The buttons are too small and sometimes hard to find the right one. I also had a problem getting the next button to work for my cable DVR. Don't expect a perfect replacement for the original remotes, but it is close to duplicating almost all functions."
5,Love my Harmony 880!,"We have several different A/V units and I wanted one remote that would control all of them so I bought the Harmony 880.The software setup was a breeze. Just answer a few questions about how your equipment ""talks"" to each other; download the info to the remote; and you're good to go. It even turns on our PS2 and receiver on at the same time. LOVE IT!!! So easy - even my hubby can use it and he's not technology savvy at all."
3,Logitech Harmony 880,"I bought this to replace my 550 that had been stolen. The 880 looks cooler and has the rechargeable battery with docking station.However, the 550 had a much better range and the buttons were easier to operate. The buttons on the 880 are too small and very crowded.Still the same great setup and convenience as the rest of the series but if the looks are not that important, go with the 550."
2,Plan to replace it after 24 months,I dearly loved this remote once I convinced myself to invest this much in a universal. Once it was programmed to my specfications it became a great tool - and I rarely had to pull out an original remote for anything. I was really sold on the charger and love the fact that I no longer had to buy (and dispose of) batteries. That proved to be the eventual problem.Things fell apart after I had been using the 880 remote for about 18 months. The battery took longer and longer to fully charge - and eventually did not fully rechage at all. Now the battery pack is dead and no one (Logitech included) seems to have a replacement.
4,Harmony 880,"We own two Harmony 880's, and are thrilled. The remote handles everything; surround sound, high definition television, DVD, VCR, and reciever. The only negative is that when I switch to basic TV to view our local channels via an antenna I need to use the TV remote to control the volume. Our second remote was purchased in Jaunary 2007 and it is in need of repair. The '0' on the touch pad is not working. I feel confident that this matter can be resolved. I would recommend this remote to anyone having multiple electronic systems."
5,What a great product,"It was with considerable trepidation that I purchased the Harmony 880. I have had nothing but less than satisfactory performance out of previous universal remotes that I have tried. The 880 is the exception. It is extremely easy to program and does exactly what it says it will do. If it does get out of sync, the help button helps you get it right back in sync with your system. Again, what a great product."
3,good,I like it but with all the stuff I have its kinda a pain to use to go back and forth changing things so I never use it .
4,harmony 880 advanced controller,"very nice controller alittle hard to set up, when the controller is setup it works very nice. would purchase again. worth the money if you can afford it."
5,Awesome!,"I don't know how I ever got by without this remote. You can control almost all functions of any component and it's very user friendly.Alot of remotes claim to be universal, but don't live up to the billing.You can customize your settings by hooking the remote up to the computer via a usb cable and using the software that is provided. Very easy process. And if you ever lose or break the remote and have to buy a new one the software will remember your settings and program your new remote in just a few seconds!"
1,Wonderful until it broke,"I had my Harmony 880 for a couple years. I loved it. My Wife loved it. The kids loved it. The only issue is needing to manually program our Roku box into it (!?!). Then the 1 and 3 buttons stopped working. You would think that for a remote that cost close to $300 new, you would be able to fix it. Logitech's out of warranty response was for me to buy a new one! No option to repair it. At any price. Just throw away a $300 remote and buy a new one. I don't think so Vern!"
3,If only the buttons worked more reliably!,"I'm on my third Harmony 880 now. The first two have been replaced under warranty kindly enough, but the problem is that after a short time, a critical button becomes difficult or impossible to press. The 5 button failed on one remote. The volume down button failed on another, and on my current remote, the power button requires deliberate and excessive pressure.I use this remote to control a TiVo connected to a stereo receiver and HD TV. There are various game systems hooked up as well. It offers logical buttons for all the activities from listening to radio to playing each of the game systems, to watching TV through the inputs on the back. In all, it's easy to use once it's set up, and it's not so bad to set up.I like the ""help"" button which asks some questions to help get the system into the right state when, for example, someone didn't point the remote at the TV quite long enough."
2,"Good Remote, Bad Design",I got to say this remote was good for a while until the buttons started going bad. I think it's a known problem with these models and after it went bad with just minor use in about 3 months. I got a 550 and a 720 to replace this one. These 2 are much better in design and way more durable. My 720 i bought refurbished and it has been awesome. I won't recommend this remote model to anyone. I can't even give mine away for free.
2,Great for half the price...,"The number buttons are not responsive enough for three digit channels. It takes several attempts for all of the numbers to register. Also the device mode has issues with the power button staying in activity mode. For that reason, you cannot power on or off a specific device without the remote assuming power settings for the other devices."
3,Great for awhile,"We bought this remote a couple years ago when it was still $250. We LOVED it until recently. Several buttons have stopped working. We have switched some of the functions to other buttons over the last month, but now its time to replace it. For the price it is now, its probably still a good deal, but at $250 I'm dissappointed it didn't last longer."
3,Works sometimes,"I have things setup properly and still having issues. I have to use the ""help"" button almost every time. It seems to have issues changing my tv's input settings for the xbox. Its still quicker than fumbling with 4 remotes..."
4,Great choice for a remote,I purchased this remote about two months ago and so far I have loved it. You can set it up in a basic sense where you just allow the standard buttons to populate the LCD screen or you can fully customize the remote so that you only see those buttons you use the most. The web interface is straight forward and easy to use. You can even setup sequences where you can program a series of events to occur. I have not had any issues with the charger or remote at this time. Currently my wife find it easier to use and so does my young son.
4,"Generallys works fine, but some hiccups","This is my first univeral remote. I like that I can program it to turn on multiple items at one time (TV, receiver, HDMI switcher, HD-DVD player). Sometimes though, it doesn't always turn them all at the right time and things get thrown off.I sometimes still use my original remotes, but this one has definitely made the turning on and off much more straight forward. Of course, it can't control my PS3, but I knew that going in."
4,Awesome,"Received a defective unit, however, Logitech techsupport couldn't solve the problems, exchanged a new one from Amazon (thanks to Amazon's fast exchange program).Programmed the remote was a bit difficult, but not terrible bad, need to trial and errors. After about 2hrs, my systems was up and run, lots of features. To turn on/off the devices, need to point to the devices in 2-3 seconds for them to receive the command signal. Cool products. My parents could turn on Midi-karaoke systems, or watch music video with 1 click now, normally they have to turn on: Turn-on TV & change to video2 input, turn-on Karaoke mixer & change to CDG input, Karaoke machine, turn-on Receiver & select Video input."
4,It lives up to it's promise; I like it a lot.,"This remote tamed my home theater system where so many others couldn't.It does an excellent job of keeping track of ""activities"" so switching from CDs, to radio, to DVDs, to watching the dish, is a snap. If you don't like to program and tweak your remote, or want something extremely simple for the technology impaired, this probably isn't the best choice. But if you want a remote that will control just about any equipment in any combination, this will do it. I like that it is rechagable so I'm not buying batteries every few months.My only criticisms are: Small-ish buttons and labels may make it difficult for some to use. Programming is very flexible, but I don't like having to go online to program it. It slows things down and what if Logitech ever stops support of their website? There are no true macros although you can create ""activities"" that will handle some macro-like commands.All-in-all a very nice remote and a good value."
5,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control,Everything that we were hoping for with this remote came true. The set-up was extremely simple and everything went exactly as they said during the entire set-up process. We now have 1 remote on our table and were able to put the other 6 away in the drawer.
4,Overall I'm pleased with this remote,"Pros:- Overall shape and design features are excellent. Virtually flat learning curve.- Beams signal through top and bottom so equipment behind you is not a problem (important for activities buttons that affect multiple units)- Web setup could not be simpler- Lots of other good stuff, but you can read about it in specsCons:- The OK button in the center of the channel/vol rocker should be Mute instead. The OK doesn't seem to do anything, and I have to hunt for the mute. Major Faux Pas.- As expected, a few important features for my tv don't work (like switching from antenna (my only source of high def) to cable. Would be nice if I could reprogram some buttons."
3,Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this device when I ordered it. The reviews I got from podcasts and magazines were great, so when I programed the remote online and began using it I found you will have to spend hours tweeking it to work the way you want. I should say the way you wish you could have it. Some things would work ok and others, such as changing from one input on your tv, to another never works when using the activities program. You spend much of your time using the help button to correct the problem, though it keeps happening. If you wish to tweek anything on the remote it will screw up other things. I have been so frustrated and disappointed in this remote because I thought I was getting a high quality product. Unfortunetly it is like most universal products, high on promises and low on delivery. On the positive side, it looks great and some of the features do work, but don't get your hopes to high!"
5,Excellent product,"I have tried other ""universal"" remotes--none of which simplified my life.The Harmony 880 ended that problem. It is awesome. Can't say enough for it.Installation was simple, truly plug and play. It is a joy to use. My wife loves it. She hates multiple remotes. Loves Harmony.I am especially impressed with its intelligence, able to solve complex problems with a simple sequence of questions ending with, ""Did that solve the problem?"" So far, our answer has been ""yes"", 100%.I highly recommend this product. Logitech has scored a big one with Harmony. And, considering its capabilities and ease of use, it is way underpriced. (Don't tell Logitech.)"
2,Glorified Universal,"You can get the same features from a universal controler that only costs 30 bucks. Of course the 30 dollar controler will not have a color screen but big deal, the both do the same thing. I bought this controler thinking that for over one hundred bucks it should be one of those remotes that work through walls and cabinets but it is not. I had to return it and get the Harmony 890 in order to work through walls and cabinets, but for 100 bucks I don't know why anyone would want the 880 other than a color screen and a rechargable lithiom battery? Doesn't seem worth it to me, but that's just me."
1,No support for Mac OS X 10.5/Leopard.....yet,"I'm returning mine bec/ after hours trying to get the software to work, I was told by tier 2 support that they don't yet support the latest version of the Mac OS.For Mac users, the good news is that he indicated they were getting lots of calls from Mac users and were working hard to get it done quickly, but, in the meantime, I'll return mine."
2,This remote is NOT customizable! Software is useless!,"The web-based software for this remote treats users as idiots and does not allow basic customization to be done. For example, you cannot move menu options from page 11 of 12 to page 2 because you use the feature often and want to get to it without having to hit a button 12 times. Also, you cannot adjust the ""Activity"" options fully so that when you have just put a DVD in the player, since the player is on at that point, you don't need the power turned on (which means the power gets turned off)! IF they completely overhaul the software, it would be a nice little remote."
1,what an overpriced piece of crap,"where to start:the installation software is buggy to say the least -- totally incompatable with any firewall software including xp's own.the remote itself is lightweight and flimsy, and simply does not feel durable.the charger does not seem to cradle the remote adequately -- you have to slide the remote in just right, or place a weight ont top of it for the remote's contacts to connect properly to the charger's.For over two-hundred dollars I will use the various remotes on an as-needed basis."
1,good but battery problems = epic fail,"good unit when it works, unfortunately, the battery does not fit well and it reboots or does not charge, really pain and now thinking about ditching the unit"
2,Average Person can't figure out controls,"In concept, having a single remote is a great idea. In reality, you need to know every make of your electronics or will be sitting there for an hour clicking away trying to find the codes, may need to go on-line to input each electronic system, plus you need to know the settings for your tv and cable box and the order in which they turn on. In short, set-up is not easy. I can't recommend any home product that requires so much techno savvy to set up."
2,Bottom Feeder,"I own several Harmony remotes. Most are quite nice but this one is a bottom feeder. The buttons are way to small and cheap. back lighting is horrible to the point you can not see what's on the micro dot buttons. The color screen makes things even harder to read, You can turn off the graphics which makes it a little easier to read though. The activity buttons are way to close together for the average Joe to use. They could of done a lot better. Funny thing is out of all the remotes they make the 610 would be the winner hands down if the added auto back lighting and more then 5 devises to it. What I do not understand is why all the rechargeable and color remotes are the worst they make. Go figure.I suggest you buy from Amazon so if you hate it you can return it for another model you'll be happy with."
2,Harmoney does not send the correct messages to our Olevia Television.,It does not receive or send the correct messages to our Olevia Television. The model of our Olevia is 255T FHD. Is there anything you can do to resolve this problem? Would appreciate a response. Thank you.
1,14 months old and dead,"first the cradle that they sent with it shorted out and would not charge the battery after 3 months, got new cradle, then after the 13th month the infrared stopped working, now its dead and out of the 12 mo warranty.update 4/2/2007 called logitech seems they may give me a new unit, it has to go to a senior RMA consultant, whatever that is, but they said they will call me back, and I will update as they do."
5,Still humming after 7 years! PLUS: How to solve charging base issues,"I bought a refurbished 880 back in 2006. Since then I've used it with 4 different HT setups on 2 continents, and it's still running strong. The software can be unwieldy, but in exchange you get almost unlimited upgradeability and customizability. Having handled both the Harmony One and the Touch, this is still my favorite remote ever.Until recently I had had problems charging the remote--it wouldn't sit properly in the charging base. I wound up having weight it down with a book to get it to charge. However, I found that by sanding down the plastic on the area where the charging contacts are you can easily restore this functionality. Use a medium (200-320) grade sandpaper wrapped around something hard like a small wooden block. Don't worry if you sand the metal contacts a bit either. I had to take down about .5 mm before the problem went away, but now it charges like a champ! Looks like I won't have to upgrade for a while yet."
3,Not A bad Gadget,This remote works wonderfully if it is the only remote you are going to use and if you have perfect Line of sight. I have a coffee table in my way from my couch and it inhibits the remote from working about 40% of the time but If I have direct line of sight then it works perfectly! I cant fault the product but my universal remote that came with my DVR works a good bit better from the same spot.
4,Harmony 880 remote,"A very powerful remote at a reasonable price. Setup is relatively painless and quick, and customer support is very helpful if you have problems."
4,Very very good....!,"Great remote that controls 1000's of components. Innovative ""Activities Button"" for simple one touch controls. Programming is a bit on the troublesome side when you have to log on to your computer, but otherwise livable. Only major problem I have is with the buttons. Some are very small which makes it too difficult to navigate and as well to push onto."
4,Harmony 880 is what I needed!,My wife was so frustrated with the multiple remotes she was about ready to scream. I broke down and purchased the 880 after researching different remotes. I am not sorry I purchased the 880. I have been able to set up everything relatively easy. The only problem I had was dealt with quickly and easily through the live customer support. Great product!
1,good but bad,"I used to love Harmony, but the new web site leaves a lot to be desired. You have to create a new account, imagine if you needed a different account for each store you shoppped at, rather than have 1 account with multiple devices.Also you need to remember the device rather than have thoe dropdowns populated,how do you know if it can control the device if it's physically not there.Too me this smacks of a small great company being bought by a big one and being institutionalized, whoever redesigned this site doesnt have a wand (or two) and does'nt care about the users."
3,A LOT OF HYPE,"I WAS SO EXITED TO BE GETTING MY FIRST ALL IN ONE HARMONY REMOTE...BUT THAT DIDN'T LAST LONG..IT DOES EVERYTHING IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT THE COLOR SCREEN IS NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL..AND, THE BUTTONS ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER AND SMALL...AFTER A FEW DAYS, THE CHARGER ALSO ACTED UP ON ME..I HAVE TO PHISICALLY PUSH THE REMOTE INTO THE CRADLE TO CHARGE...NO WORTH THE MONEY IN MY OPINION...."
1,Quality SUCKS,"Trust me when I tell you that this POS will break within a year (broken buttons, battery not charging, etc.) Just google the numerous user complaints. After your warranty is up, the only ""fix"" Logitech will offer you is to buy a REPLACEMENT remote, which only carries a 30-day warranty, at 50% discount. It's not a coincidence that the warranty period is so short. So don't think you're buying this remote to own and use for more than a year. You're merely RENTING it, because it WILL break in a year, I guarantee it."
1,Literally useless,"Pros+Definitely better than having a dozen different remotes+The activities allow you to switch on everything you need - TV, AV, DVD to watch a DVD for example.Cons-The installation software is unbelievably clunky and time-consuming.-The default options for activities and devices usually puts the most useful functions several screens down the menu. You can change it using the software but it's a pain.-The activities need a lot of tweaking to get them to set everything up propoerly - even then, they only do so most of the time.-The battery swelled up, became unchargeable and broke the battery cover.-So did the replacement battery I got from Logitech.-It's now completely useless.Conclusion: it could make me ricotta pancakes with blueberries in bed but it would still be completely useless because of the battery/charging issue."
3,Logitech 880,"Programing fine after four attempts. Screen a little on the small side, especially if eyesight not that good. Otherwise,performs as advertised"
5,!!!!!!!!GREAT REMOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got a great deal on this remote. I was looking at these at Circuit City and they wanted $150.00 more than I paid for this on Amazon. Mine was an open box, but so what. the remote didn't have a scratch on it and still had the protective plastic on it. It was very easy to set up. I have owned other learning remotes that use macros and they didn't function half as well as this one. Everything is programed in your PC which makes it really easy. It also comes with a docking station with a lith. ion battery, so batteries are not an issue. Color lcd screen is a plus. Best $107.00 shipped I spent.The only thing I would have done different would have been not using the free super saver shipping. I needed a new remote as my old one broke."
5,Logitech Harmoney 880 Remote,This is my second Harmony 880. Obviously I am happy with this unit or I wouldn't buy a second one for another room.
3,Great Controller - Terrible charger,The Logitech Harmony 880 is a wonderful product in every regard except for the interface between the control itself and the charger base. When new. it charges perfectly but after several months it becomes difficult to get a reliable contact between the controller and the charging cradle. I can only speculate that this is a result of corrosion buildup on the contacts that occurs over time or possibly a weakening of the springs that force the contacts together. Logitech replaced my first control and base under warrenty but the new one only lasted about a year and the exact same problem recurred. I expect if there were a simple way to clean the contacts periodically then this issue would be resolved. My advice - buy the control with a warrenty if available or wait for a newer version that solves the charging problem (Logitech WILL solve this problem in time if they haven't already). My experience is that you may need service in about 18 months or less.
5,Great Remote for the price,I lucked out and found this for under 100 (which is a price I had told myself I would not pass up) I have a 600 series Harmony that this is replacing because I wanted the charging cradle. Some folks have reported problems but I have encountered none. The software is simple to use and update as I add or take away from my home theater.
2,Not Worth the Money,"Initially, I thought this remote was a great investment. It looks very cool, has a great charging base, and the display is easy to read. Unfortunately after a couple days of use, I found the button layout to be very awkward and several buttons had to be pressed very hard in order to function, including the Channel Up button! I ended up sending it back and purchasing the Harmony 670. Less money and the button design and layout is much more user friendly."
5,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control,Love this remote. It is absolutely the easiest remote to use. Makes changing from TV to DVD or music or etc. absolutely painless. Others have been confusing and often frustrating. This is our second one. Not because the remote went out - it had liquid spilled on it.
3,Worked Great when it Worked...,"I was on my third one of these. Bought it once, but got two replacements from Logitech. The battery would always stop charging and the remote would die. I now need a new one and bumped into this one. It's a great remote, but the battery charging is flawed."
5,What a find!!,"This remote is stylish and functional. Now I can do it all myself instead of needing my husbands help. Ladies, all you do is point and click for whatever function you require. It could not be easier!! I love it."
4,Second one Works Well,"This universal remote control does indeed work all of our components, it even delays the Dolby 5.1 sound system when turning on the TV so that the sound works properly! This is the second one we have sent to us. Not all of the buttons worked on the first one. Figuring out the functions of most buttons is intuitive, but there are a few operations we still haven't figured out. Some sort of an instruction manual would have been helpful. Some buttons are fairly small and it is easy to end up pressing the wrong one at times."
5,I love this thing!,I've been waiting for this remote for over a year and finally got around to ordering one. This is the perfect remote for my media setup. I couldn't ask for more. I have a friend that has one and now I have my own. I love it.
3,Works Perfect...But!,"I bought this device to control my AV Receiver, DVR, TV, Media Center PC and Playstation 3. The device is simple to setup using your PC. The problem I found was the buttons are too small and not positioned for easy access. The DVR controls (which are used 90% of the time) are to close together and it's almost impossible to discern the button by feel. After a week I gave up and got the Harmony One which I love!"
5,AWESOME remote!,It is so nice having a single remote control all my equipment. It takes some time to program - but works very well. I am very happy I got the remote that has a recharger and it has to be charged about once every couple weeks.
4,Logitec Harmony Remote 880,This remote is great I am so glad we don't have 5 remotes anymore. It was a little difficult to set up since one of our remotes had stopped working but once we got it programed the way we needed it it is wonderful.
4,Good mid range remote,"We've had a series of cheaper remotes that were hard to set up and ultimately didn't control all of our devices completely. We've never been able to put all of the remotes in a drawer and use one universal remote before buying this one.Set up was quick and easy and we're able to press one button to perform any activity - watch TV, play a DVD, listen to the radio, play Xbox 360. Each one turns the correct device on or off, changes the input on the TV, etc. If you don't like the default buttons they can easily be changed.My one complaint is that the remote is very slick and slippery. I have a hard time using it with one hand because it slips out easily."
3,After a few years,"I have been using the 880 for a few years now along with two 550's bought shortly later (for less used systems). While the 880 has a lot of nice features, at the end of the day I prefer the 550. Why? The 550 has a better button interface that can be used by feel. Also, the 880 has developed a problem where certain buttons have to be pressed harder to activate. Also, you have to be attentive when placing the remote into the dock for charging. So am I getting another 550? No, I am getting a Harmony One to replace the 880. The One seems to take the best features of both the 550 and 880 and then combines them."
3,neat but small,"great remote but buy the model that is two down on logitechs website, the back lighting is weak on this model making it difficult to see the numerals and words, the lesser model is more clearly lit and easier to use"
4,Great Uni,"It take a while to program, but it works great. It helps that if you have the remotes that you are replacing. I would have given 5 stars but it does take some tweaking and each time you have to update, test, and then you can try it...if your update did not work start over."
4,Quadroople love it,Works as advertised. We have a myriad of remotes that we replaced. It still feels a little odd in your hand but that is it. I was actually able to program it on the logitech site before it arrived and then just had to download it when we got it. This was really cool so within 10 minutes of opening it we were using it.
3,Great Remote Logitech stinks,"This remote is great. I can control my Monoprice HDMI switch and Pelican System Selector Pro. This means I only have to push one button to watch TV or switch to playing a movie or one of my game systems. Logitech is angering me right now though because I had almost perfected all my buttons when they started an update to Harmony Remote Software. Also, you still have to download the latest software so it doesn't make sense to install the CD. It is beyond me why they even bother with a CD when the setup is completely online. Overall, doing a system update to their online software that leaves my Remote unusable is completely unacceptable. Also, the buttons feel cheap and the remote feels like it could break easily compared to the remotes that come with your components. Don't buy this remote unless you are a gadget geek and have no children."
1,New form of torture...,"The CIA could use this thing to ""extract"" any confession. Forty-five minutes with this device and my heart rate was up and mind was a blur. Never got the TV to turn on, and it reset half the setting on my receiver... incorrectly. It is OBVIOUSLY going back to the manufacturer."
1,JUNK!,"Don't bother......I just spent 3 hours trying to get the programing online, and it isn't what they say! I'm not new to this type of equipment, and I've never experienced such difficulties. The hardware might be good, but Logitech software is lame! I'm sending this back, and will go with Sony"
1,Poor Design,"I bought one and while the remote and its features are really good, the design of the recharging system is poor. The contacts that connect to the remote in the cradle become corroded and fail to make contact. After a few months of use the remote stops recharging. If I use alcohol or some other cleaner I am able to get the contacts clean enough to allow for a partial charge, but it soon becomes problematic again and I am unable to recharge. A pity as the remote is good. Beware. Customer support at Logitech are morons and unhelpful."
2,Hate it!,"Part of my displeasure is my own fault, but I'm still using 3 remotes on a regular basis. This thing won't work with the PS3, which is what we use to play our DVD's, so that's 1. And, since it doesn't work with the PS3, we can't use the new one to switch back and forth from the PS3 screen to the TV, so we're still using the receiver remote to do that. Also, the volume control buttons on the new one SUCK! We've had it less than a month, spent almost 160 bucks on this thing and I've almost retired it already. The receiver remote works just fine. I'm kicking myself for buying this thing....."
2,Harmony 880,"The product is great except for teh fact it will not control my Bose System. I was told it would, and when it didn't, I sent it back."
1,sucks,this is the biggest waste of time and money i have spent.the battery would not charge and logitech did not even respond to my request for help with this problem.so i would never recommend this to anyone buyers be warned.
3,Customer service at Logitec,"The universal remore control was fairly easy to set up and use but occasionally, it sets the audio/visual function to the radio when it should go to vidio input from the satelite system. The cust. service web site encourages you to email the problem rather than call. I have been waiting over three weeks for a response to my email on how to solve this intermitant problem. In my opinion,that stinks!"
2,product much better than support,was very satisfied with the product - But beware Logitech is not all that committed to supporting the products that they sell. The web site is set up to make it difficult to get support.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS REMOTE!,"This is my second remote of this model and I have five other Logitech Harmony remotes in the house.Take my advice and DO NOT buy this remote. The keys have a tendency to fall out and, if like me, you have young children, the results could be disastrous.Logitech's customer service is nothing but shameful. I called the company to purchase new keys. After a 32 minute hold I was connected to somewhere in Asia where the service tech, who had a poor English accent asked me about twelve irrelevant questions. I told him that I wanted to buy new keys and was told as the remote was just out of warranty they could not help, but can sell me a battery door cover!I then went onto to a manger who said they cannot help but can sell me a new one for 50% off! Now that's customer service.If you buy this then do so at your own peril, eventually yo will need some customer support and its just not there; that is unless you want to buy another."
5,"Easy, complete, the last remote I'll own","So easy even a cave man (with internet access)could do it. I particularly like the ""help"" button, as the programming left a few (very few) glitches. I went from 4 remotes down to the one, and couldn't be happier. Takes a little time getting used to the positioning of some of the buttons (like, in my opinion, the mute and previous channel buttons should be reversed) but pretty much as billed."
3,Needs some work,"The remote itself works great and has replaced all of our remotes. It also recognized all of our equipment and was very easy to program. I would buy it again if... they fixed the charger base!!! Just setting the remote in the base isn't enough. It has to be balanced perfectly and then you have to tiptoe away, otherwise the vibrations make the remote think it isn't in the charger. It's a pain. Two or three times a week we find the remote, in the charger, almost completely discharged. For $200, I expect better."
4,"Discontinued--Don't Buy ""New"" Remote","I had this remote--it was great. I loved it. But it had a defective battery, and Logitech replaced it for free under warranty. That was about 2 years ago--but Logitech replaced it with the HARMONY ONE because the 880 was discontinued. DON'T BUY A ""NEW"" 880--the Harmony One is MUCH BETTER, and is cheaper here on Amazon. This is probably a re-furb or something that's been sitting around--and probably has a defective battery (I had to have my Harmony One battery replaced under warranty too)."
4,Overall Impressed,"This is a very clean looking remote. It works well once programed. You do not need to be overly computer savy to make it work well as I am not. Very impressed with the fact that all the funtions of the replacement remotes can be performed on the new one, not just the basics. Can be a little confusing once you have a function working. What i mean is, once I am watching sattelite and start playing around with remote I am not able to controll volume. If i do not mess around with it, it works just fine."
1,Great Remote but non stop Issues,"After about 6 months the remote just stopped charging. Harmony sent me a new battery and cradle which seemed to fix the problem but after another 6 months it's started to do the same thing. Even worse now the ""Activity"" button has stopped working... The remote worked great while it actually worked but for $150 you would hope that it would last more than a year."
4,Harmony universal remote,"The Logitech Harmony remote is an excellent product but takes a great deal of patience to program. I worked on it for about 6 hours to program a HD TV, A direct TV DVR receiver, A HD Direct TV Receiver, A Sony DVD player, a VCR and a surround sound system.I would be nice if the TV sound and Sound system could be controlled at the same time.I couldn't get the remote to control the sound on the TV until I called their support and they reset the sound."
3,OK Product!,"The programming is a bit tricky, but a couple of hours later and it works great with the AVR, TV and DVD player. Only two complaints:1. The charging base. During the night (usually when I'm trying to sleep), the thing sometime beeps....intermittently...as it's not making good contact; I've come home from vacation only to find the remote completely dead. UPDATE: I contacted Logitech and they sent me a new model of base...and NO MORE BEEPING! UPDATE 2: About a year after the replacement, the beeping returned (due to a failed spring on the center spring-loaded contact)....I finally sold the remote and picked up the new Harmony ONE (the One is really the One, to quote an online source).2. Slow...each command is slow, and you have to wait for each command to be executed before blocking the IR beam...I set the remote down during initial system turn-on. UPDATE: You can cut the duration of each command (milliseconds) to speed up the remote!"
2,Don't depend on Customer Service help,"The control seemed simple and straight-forward to set-up, except when I needed to change the input source on the TV. Built-in help did not correct the problem. After three e-mails and a phone call I never did get a response from Logitech's Customer Service. Very disappointed in the total lack of response. However, after several attempts I was able to get the remote to work on my own. Aside from the terrible customer support, the only other issue I've run into is that the buttons are too small to easily manipulate."
4,"Wonderful, easy to use, will solve your remote problems","I must warn you, right out of the box the battery is not charged so you can't immediately play with it. The good news is that after you wait a few hours for the battery to charge you will have no complaints. I was worried about the charging cradle after reading some reviews but I have had absolutely no problems. In fact, I just drop it in the charger once a week overnight. You'll have to worry about batteries no more. Also, the web interface was easy to use but if you have some trouble and call their FREE tech support, they do an amazing job at quickly helping you out. Great product. If you have the money to spend, buy it now."
4,Works well,"Setting up and editing activities could be a little bit easier. If you want to change the way a device acts, or how a group works, you have to go through a bunch of menus. Once you get the little bugs worked out the remote works very well. I bought one for my parents as well, and took them from 6 remotes down to 1. They are happy with it."
5,Perfect Remote!,"My requirements for a universal remote were easy setup, intuitive use, and powerful functionality. This remote has all three. The on-line setup worked great for my components (HD DirecTivo, HD TV, DVD, VCR, CD Jukebox, AV Receiver and Aux CD Piano Player). Access the Logitech website, enter your component brands and model numbers, answer a few questions, customize a few buttons (if you want to), download the result, and it works! The control panel is logical and well-organized, with about the right number of decent size buttons. The screen is readable and the backlight comes on when you pick it up. The charging cradle is handy and negates the need for changing batteries. As for functionality, so far I haven't found anything this remote can not do in a straight-forward way. For me it's the perfect remote."
2,"Poor button sizing, spacing and layout","The features of this remote are fantastic and it is fairly easy to setup. Unfortunately the button design is poor. Especially the frequently used channel up/down and volume buttons. They're way too small and ""skinny"". The buttons at the sides of the lcd screen suffer from the same problem. The number buttons and play/pause/rewind buttons are tolerable but would benefit from some better spacing.I am returning this remote and will be purchasing the Harmony One. Even at double the price of the 880 I find it to be a better option."
3,Harmony 880,"Because it cannot communicate with RF devices, e.g., DISH Network receivers, it fails to do as promised, i.e., replace all other remotes. The Harmony 880 does a fine job with those devices that respond to IR signals, but with my DISH setup it is necessary to use two controls. Thus to change channels I still must use the dish remote. The packaging on the Harmony 880 does not disclose this or I would not have bought it. It would be a 5 star if it handled both IR and RF devices."
1,DO NOT BUY LOGITECH REMOTES,"Overall I was happy with the remote. The buttons are very small, that was my wife's complaint, but I did not mind, too much. I have had it a couple of years and now after dealing with Logitech on the remote, I find myself having to write this. Stay away from Logitech remotes. Their batteries expanded a bit too much and in my case broke 2 on the clips on the remote itself, that holds the battery cover on, and 1 on the cover itself. Logitech is telling me that I am out of warranty so they do not care. But I do! It was their remote, their battery, not an aftermarket one. They also told me that their batteries do expand and that bothers me. So I would have to say ""DO NO BUY LOGITECH REMOTES!!!!!!!"" They are far too expensive to have this happen! This is also going to the Better Business Bureau for a complaint!"
1,Poor quality control,"I know people who have this remote who are happy with it, so I'm sure there are good samples out there, but 2 I got from Amazon both had faulty keys. On the first one, several keys simply didn't work. On the replacement they all worked but required multiple presses sometimes with a lot of force to get them to register. Amazon declined to send me another replacement (and I can't say I blame them) so I don't know if this was just a bad batch they had or if this product has taken a turn for the worse. Buyer beware: good idea, poor execution."
4,Hubbie's present my favorite remote,I got this product for my husband but use it more myself...I wish I could tell you it was a snap to set up but I did need my 18-year old son to walk through all of the steps for each of the components being programmed. It was not as easy to go back and make changes once we'd realized we hadn't done things correctly the first time through. Really think about what you need the functionality to be...or your hubbies favorite sports shows won't be programmed (still hearing about the lost games that weren't recorded).Once we worked through these details the remote could not be easier to use. I love the simplicity of the screen and how it course corrects itself when a given component has not turned on correctly. I also like the fact that we always know where it is...since it sits in it's own charging base. Great product. I wish I had one for my other TVs.
5,Logitech Harmony 880 Universal Remote Works Great,Purchased a refurbished Logitech Harmony 880 Universal remote and the only indication it wasn't new was no protective cover over the LCD. I had to have customer service help me get the unit to turn on and off my Sony CD/DVD player as it took a double pulse to work! They took care of the problem and were professional to work with. The remote does what I need and it's simple to use! It has certainly taken the hassle out of using four different remotes any time you want to watch a DVD.H.K.
5,Incredible Remote !,"I received my Harmony 880 yesterday, and all I can say is WOW!! It took me about 15 minutes to set it up, and everything worked perfectly the very first time. This remote runs my Pioneer AV Receiver better than the orig. remote. I plugged it back inot my PC this morning to make a few minor tweeks, like changing the ""Watch PVR"" to ""Watch TV"". Very, very easy. I have checked, and re-checked all of the buttons for each of my components, and every one of them function perfectly. BUY THIS REMOTE, YOU WILL LOVE IT !!"
5,This thing is great!!!,"I love this thing, the activities and help button make it so I can talk my 8 year old niece into setting up a movie so she can watch it...it is pricy but well worth it, I am going to get another one for my room!!!"
1,"Total junk, Avoid at all costs!","I tried 4 different computers under both Mac OS X and WIndows XP and never could get this piece of junk to program. Logitech tech support is non-existent.(and yes the other buyer's note about being put on hold for 10 minutes telling you that the next available rep blah blah blah and then hanging up on you is absoultely true, but heh, that is OK because they don't answer their emails either! Not only am I returning this junk, I will think two ( or three or ten) times before I ever buy another logitech thing again."
4,Great Customer Service,"I have had this product for a couple of months now. And have read some of the comments on customer service that I felt were unjust, so I wanted to share my experience. First of all, the bad, if you want to communicate with Logitech...pick up the phone. I have yet to have them answer an email. However, I have had some unique programming challenges and these folks will stay the course until the problem is resolved. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes on hold.On the remote itself, I have found it to do everything it advertises. The downside is that it could of been better designed ergonomically."
2,Buttons will stop working at about the 2 year mark,"The conceptual design of the remote is excellent 5 stars. However, the charging contacts issue (others have alluded to) and high use buttons (ch +/- and vol +/-) will stop working after about 2 years. Numerous accounts of this on the logitech forum site. The buttons are plastic-ky and feel very flimsy. For the amount you're paying for this remote, the value in return is not there. You'd expect this investment to work more than 5 years. I can understand if the screen goes but the simple, most fundamental aspect of a remote (the buttons) have to be designed and tested for longer use than 2 years. That is the only reason why I cannot give this remote more than 2 stars."
2,Frustrating...,"I got hooked into all of the positive reviews in all the magazines and web sites, but I have been very disappointed with the actual use of the remote. I have had it for about a year now, and it certainly has a lot of flexibility in what you can program it to do, and that is very nice. However, it is the day-to-day use of the volume control and changing channels that make me want to chuck the whole thing through my 62"" HDTV. The switching to DVD or PS2 and back to the Satellite is always an adventure too.When it works, it's nice, but there are just enough glitches that make it frustrating to use every day. It could be that I am trying to do too much (DirecTV/Tivo, Yamaha receiver, Phillips TV), but for the money, I expect it to work better. I never had this many problems with my wonderful MX 500. My advice, stay away until the price comes down or the remote is more solid in another year or two."
2,Average Remote,"This is not performing as I expected. This remote in an average remote and for the price doesn't live up to expectations. Although this remote does provide a way to control numerous components, it does create some issues that are not efficient. I find I have to circumvent its own procedure and operate my components individually to operate correctly. I have tried to reprogram it numerous times, but to no avail. At least I now have a single remote, but I could do this with a cheaper remote. Average is what I think. Not too impressive. Buy a cheaper version - you'll be happier. Sorry."
4,Too bad they're not making this model any more,"There's not much point in repeating opinions already posted. This is still a good useful product because, fortunately, Logitech still supports it with new device definitions, and it's one of the few available now that allows the user to define sequences. That was the reason I grabbed one while it's still available. I hope I can get enough time out of this until some future remote also has this feature.The reason for four stars instead of five is Logitech's horrible software interface. Programming is needlessly clumsy and tedious. Naturally, there will be no updates to the programming environment, so this is one of the things you have to live with.BTW, if you have one of these and are trying to program a Roku, it's a DVD. I have no idea why, but that's where they put it."
3,"Could be great, but not quite","Have owned this remote for almost 3 years and have loved it, excecpt for one thing. I don't know why I bought remote that did not use regular batteries. The rechargable battery and charging stand are great, for about a year. Started to have problems with the battery not holding a charge, so I bought a new one on here for a good price. Put it in the remote and could not get it to charge. So I then found a decent price for a battery and quick charger. So now I have a great remote with a battery that I have to take out to charge. Not ideal. Love the Harmony remotes and the ease at which you can dig into the devices and activities. I finally got sick of the battery problem and replaced the remote this week. This remote is so close to being great, that its a shame they did not put in regular batteries."
2,"Remote ok, but failed after 3 years",It's like Logitech built in a design flaw so that the remote would break forcing you to buy a new one. After three years of using this remote the copper contacts on the back of the remote wore out and the battery also started to have poor contact with the internal connectors. Because of this the remote stopped charging on the cradle and with no other way to charge the battery it's as good as dead. But because it was out of warranty customer service could only offer me a discount for 50% off a new remote. I say if you want something longer lasting look to another model.
4,You really need this remote,"Like so many others with multiple remotes, I view this unit as a very attractive alternative to a sixpack of remotes. A single button turns on (in sequence) my Sony HDTV, Yamaha receiver, and FIOS DVR/receiver. Or, alternatively, the Sony, receiver, and Sony DVD - depending on the selection. It even switches the input on the receiver appropriately. A single button turns off whatever units are ""on"". And one of the best features is the ability to re-program the remote via the Logitech website if/when something is upgraded or replaced.The only downside is that (obviously) a ""universal"" remote can't select EVERY option that may be available with the manufacturer's OEM unit. But those options tend to be little used ones. Another peeve is that sometimes I must shake the unit to get the display to light up. Otherwise, I don't see how most folks can get along without one. I really like mine."
3,Save your money and get a less expensive model,"Bought this and over the next few day began to wish I had not. It's OK when it works but a pain when it doesn't, which is usually. I have to constantly hit the help button and answer question to say which device didn't turn on when I hit the original function button. For $150 it should work more consistently. I'm sure the lower model with the text screen would work just as well. Good thing the battery is rechargeable since at anything more than one day off the cradle the battery is immediately down to half power. I like the fact that when I switch to DVD it can turn on the TV, change the TV input to the DVD input, and turn on my receiver by pressing one button (when it works). Overall this does what it's supposed to do but one of the lower models or even a non Logitech remote would have worked just as well."
4,A little quirky but excellent,This product is wonderful! The only catch is you must make sure everything is off before using it. This can be problematic with people who turn off the TV manually before leaving the house but not the DVR.
3,Tried it and decided against it.,Purchased the remote after hearing from multiple friends it was a great device overall. A few indicated it took a while (roughly an hour) to get set-up so I went in with that expectation.Pros: Nice feel. Set-up software was fairly intuitive. The lit buttons were nice in the dark.Cons: Small buttons in somecases...soft buttons at the top sometimes don't mimic the OEM remote precisely.I tried for over 2 hours to get the remote to interact correctly with my equipment. I am fairly tech saavy but I was at a loss in getting it to program itself correctly. It never managed to operate everything correctly so I returned it. Amazon gets kudos for a worry free return.
4,My wife can operate the HT set-up now!,"I have used many supposed ""universal remotes"" only to have several key functions unavailable. For example, my Yamaha receiver has a separate button for power on and power off. None of the remotes I have had was able to handle this in any kind of macro. The Harmony handled it without a problem. But the real proof that this is a great remote...My wife can now use the HT system without calling me to ask what buttons she needs to push to put The Little Mermaid on for my kids..."
3,DAVE ALEXANDER,"Nice compact design,maybe a little too compact.Buttons are very small.But it does control all units that are programed very nicely.Wish theyincluded a complete paper instruction manual that you can study it at yourleisure.Only problem so far is the remote screen will go blank and the only way to get it going again is to remove and reinstall the battery.Other than that it's a great little unit."
5,The last remote you'll ever need,"Not only do I own and use this little jewel, I have had several of my friends buy this item and they all like it. Easy to use, easy to program, there is nothing that this remote cannot do to replace the original equipment remote. The ""activities"" feature performs all the functions to turn on the appropriate equipment for a task, change all the settings to the proper inputs, etc. Best toy I ever bought!!"
4,Very Nice,"The remote was very easy to set up. It knew all the button I needed, only had to set up one custom one for my Marantz receiver. Everything was perfect on my COX HD DVR and Panasonic Blu-Ray.Only negative is the DVR button layout. Play, FF, RR, pause should be higher on the remote for ease of use."
3,perfect software - imperfect hardware,"the software is really really good. six stars if i could. the hardware is not quality. buttons stop working and the charger has issues. i would buy the ""one"" instead."
4,Another fine remote,"this is my 3rd harmony remote. They seem to only last me about 2-3 years before they break on me. i know that should not be the case for such an expensive remote BUT, the week or two when i was without it sucked. i had to use the remote which came with my cable box, and it was much less usable then my 880. you have to actually aim the remote right at the cable box. with my 880, i can aim strait up in the air and it works. best feature in my opinion."
4,Needs Rebooting often,About once a week it locks up & I have to Re-Download the settins fron the web.Some of the buttons are too close together & you hit two at once..causing lockups.Other than that it is 'as advertised'.
4,Aub's review,"Remote is very easy to use, especially when you have multiple electronic components besides your TV. The software that comes with the remote is very user friendly. It is easier to setup than a regular universal remote!"
3,Works as advertised,"Works as advertised. Has many features, but you can expect to do some work to setup and take advantage of all the functions. Probably best for someone with an aptitude for working with computer stuff.Note the IR signals work, but this is not a super powerful all-directional emitter. Other advanced Harmony models should be considered if you need extended range or more reliable signaling.Button lettering can be hard to read even with backlighting if you are farsighted, and do not use bifocals. I mostly select buttons from memory using touch.It would be nice if the ""macro"" sequences were not limited to 4 command steps... not quite enough for controlling many functions on my Verizon DVR."
2,Should last longer than 3 years,Buttons have become less responsive over time and now I cannot ever lower the volume which is a constant aggravation-- will have to replace.
1,Butti=on failures,"Like many have stated, the remote has setup issues and longevity problems. Buttons begin to break or not respond after 2 years. For an expensive product, not well designed. An old remote that came with my AV Receiver works nearly as well and has lasted through 2 Harmony remotes. Never again will I waste my money on an additional remote. (Only bought it since my wife was confused by the jungle of remotes)"
1,Harminy 880 - disappointment,"I used the Harmony 880 for the past two years.very easy to setup but qaulity of the device is low, very low.within a year the volume buttons and some of the numeric keys stopped working. I have to press the keys very strong in order for them to respond.the remote was not used by children, and neither was in a humid area that can lead to this kind of mulfunction."
1,GREAT REMOTE/POOR CONSTRUCTION,"The only thing worse than the construction on this unit is customer support. I purchased my first remote, loved using it. The remote is easy to set up and easy to use. I recommend it to everyone. Then the volume button stops working.Out of warranty, and in love with the product, I purchased a second identical Harmony 880 remote. This time, after the warranty out the E button fell off.The I called product service at the company... and the best they can offer is 50% off a replacement product. I told them I am into this product for almost $500 and I am not spending anymore and there is no follow through.I own 2 Harmony 880 remotes that have button FAIL issues."
2,Flimsy,The Harmony 880 is a well designed remote that solved many of the issues I've had with other universal remotes. It worked well with DISH Network equipment and my SONY components.So what's my complaint? My son knocked it off a coffee table onto a carpeted floor. About a 2 or 3 ft drop and the screen cracked. I think for the money a fall onto a carpeted floor should be anticipated and designed in.I am very disappointed in this aspect of the Harmony
3,"Easy setup, hard to use","Setup was easy. All my devices were found and configured very quickly. I love the ability to program entire setups and not just individual devices.Although I like the remote, the buttons got progressively harder and harder to press the longer I had this remote. I eventually gave up and upgraded to the Harmony One and so far have no complaints."
1,"Doesn't pass the ""wife"" test. Common failure on volume control.","I own dozen or more logitech components. Generally good quality.I bought this to simplify my life. My wife still cannot figure out how to watch a DVD. (Ummm... push the button that says ""Watch DVD."")It's pretty complicated to setup and not the easiest thing to use. However, at least I don't have 6 remotes sitting on the table.WARNING: There is a very common problem with a mechanical failure of the volume control. The Volume ""+"" button stops working. It because of a poor design. If you do some searching on the web, you'll find that this is common with several of their models.I am hoping that the newer models don't have this issue and... pass the ""wife"" test."
3,"Great product, except for an important flaw","I bought this remote partly to get down to one remote, but mainly for the lady. It has just about any feature one could ask for in a remote, except for an important design flaw. In some units, over time, a gap appears between the pins inside the remote to the battery terminals. I believe the pins on the remote are spring loaded, and the spring force gets weaker over time, which creates the gap to the battery. Here I am, 2 years after buying what I thought was a great product, that won't recharge.[...]"
1,Beware of non-charging and lame tech support,"We had the remote for about a year before it would no longer take a charge. Searching the boards, this seems to be a common problem. Logitech support was no help (and rude on top of everything else) and would not replace the unit as the warranty had expired."
4,good device but................,"Love this device. Only 1 issue; it takes 5-10 seconds for the remote to complete communication with the marco, so you have to wait until the Harmony is talking with all the devices.Over-all; I think its great."
3,Review of Harmony 880,This remote is pretty intuitive. Buttons are layed out nicely. My only real complaint is that the buttons seem a bit touchy. You have to press them really fast or else you'll get repeated actions. I found this especially annoying when trying to navigate my DirecTV DVR. There might be a way to change the sensitivity of the buttons but I haven't found one yet. Nice remote otherwise.
1,Big Headache!,"The remote doesn't switch between inputs properly and won't work without always using the help menu. It was faster to use my old 4 remotes. I probably spent 90 minutes with the help desk on 3 separate calls. While they tried to be helpful, the remote still doesn't work."
5,Great!,"Only problem I have is the family sometimes doesn't aim the remote at the media center the whole time. The 890 was recently on sale, and if it were on sale, I'd recommend that whole heartedly. It can speak RF to a device inside the cabinet. Even if you have one with glass on it, I'd still get the 890. The RF extender wont miss. With this remote, I could simply aim at the TV only, which is the one thing that is hard to miss, and never miss a control code to the AV equipment."
5,Finally something that is truly 1 button operation!!!,"I love this remote. I hate having 5 or 6 remotes just so I can switch what i want to watch on my home theater. With the Harmony remote I can store all of them and get it all done with a push of a button. This remote is so easy my wife can do it and my mother can handle it when she comes to visit. The programing is just as easy on the computer and then you upload it to the remote. It is a ""gotta have"" for anyone with 2 or more things to turn on to watch TV. Also logitic is the best! I had another 880 that I had a small problem with the charging cradle after 11 months and when i contacted them to help fix it (after a couple of questions) they sent me a replacement Harmony one remote to replace the defective one with no hassle."
3,the jury is still out,"This product work great the first time I program it, but will not take device update with out locking up my system, will try to update the firmware and see it this correct the problem. Still very hopeful."
4,Harmony 880 Pretty Nice Remote but..,This remote is pretty awesome. i will say that i love it.... but im not in love with it! it has so many features and controls soooo many devices. i love the screen and the all options it controls for all your devices.the only problem i had with this remote is the button size and the button layout. i am one of those people who always has ther hand on the remote. since i have a dvr with stop and pause and rewind etc and since i use it often i have a problem with the fact that most of the button i need are at the lower end of the remote. making it uncomfortable to hold. the remote favors you holding it in the middle. also some of the buttons you need are pretty small with no distinguishable bumps etc for you to use without looking at them.if you use the remote sparingly and have numerous devices to control (including stereo etc) this is pretty cool and simple to set up. it also trouble shoots step by step if you have a problem. the feature is great.
5,What a remote !,"I purchased this remote 3 weeks ago and I must say I am totally impressed. The website used to download codes is so easy to use.Eight remotes are now put away,what more to say.The activities buttons [8] are priceless. Imagine hitting one button,and having all the right equipment,and all the right settings come on automatically.My 8 year old daughter uses this remote with ease.In closing if you are looking for a remote to control a lot of devices or want to simplify a complex system,and make it very wife friendly,this is the remote for you!There is a$50 mail in rebate on this item that runs until 4/25."
5,Handy remote that does everything,"I had seen reviews from others on this remote and had been wanting to try it for myself. Most other high-tech universal remotes were too bulky and I wanted something that could easily fit in one hand. The ergonomics on this is perfect and can easily reach the common buttons using your thumb. It's also pretty easy to setup, took a little time to do some real complicated things, but I figured it out eventually. I love that it has a rechargeable battery and it seems to last about a week before it runs down. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Paper Weight,I've spent all Christmas morning trying to setup the remote by connecting to their website. I can not create a new user account and tech support twice says its a problem with my internet provider! I don't buy that!(though I was gullible enough to buy the 880 Harmony!)I'm returning this very expensive paper weight!
2,Skip this one,"Set up was a breeze no questions about it.But when it came time to use it, it's just not well design. Waste of money I say."
1,Does not live up to the claims,"A bad purchase and money down the drain. The remote is now in a box and not used.I purchased with high expectations of getting my (2) Bose radios, (2) TiVo's, DVD player and TV to all play together under one remote.I was able to get my TV to function but the rest was a mess. I am confident that with enough time I could get things to work, but after one hour I gave up. Next day tried again and after 2 hours said enough is enough.Sorry to say this product does not live up to the claims."
1,Absolutely worthless,"This device simply fails to deliver on the promise of universal remote for those with more elaborate setups. The clunky setup interface lacks much-needed abilities to add specific commands in a startup sequence, and the need to log in to Logitech's online system to change commands is absurd.DO NOT buy this remote, period."
2,BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PAY!,Only a few weeks ago from today 02-07-09 I paid $118.68 for this Remote which the price immediately after dropped over fluctating over...and now the price is only $131.32.Be certain you know that this Remote needs to stay on a Charger....AND BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU PAY...ESPECIALLY IF YOU ASK FOR HELP FROM THE AMAZON HDTV STORE!.
2,remote,great if you can figure out how to program it correctly which I still have not been able to do. Phone assistance is quick and helpful.
1,Nightmare Remote,"DANGER! DANGER! DO NOT BUY THE LOGITECH HARMONY REMOTE!!If I could give it a negative 10 stars, I would. I spent about 8 hours over three days trying to get the Logitech Harmony 880 remote to work properly. A good part of that time was spent on the telephone with Logitech technical support. It seemed to be starting to work initially. That was what kept me on the hook long enough to waste so much of my time. Although even then it never operated my home theater devices properly. Also, the website setup process is complicated and confusing. The remote eventually just stopped responding to the Logitech website. Their technical support finally gave up and told me the thing was probably defective. All in all, a very bad product."
1,I HATE THIS REMOTE!!!,I spent a fortune on this remote and the damn thing never works.I cant get the things to upload...I cant get the website to work...If I do... the stupid REMOTE doesnt work.(and no its not just me- the TV setup guy couldnt get it to work either. DONT BUY IT!)
3,VERY FRUSTRATING,"I found this remote so difficult to program that 1 year after purchase, I still don't use it. If you are techie type, you would probably have no problems. I am not. I did a lot of research before purchasing this and was pretty soundly the best on the market. That is why I chose it. Some day I will sell it on the internet. It will be like new."
3,Harmony 880 Remote falls short,"I was excited to receive this expensive remote, that was supposed to control all my equipment. I have Dish satelitte. I was disappointed to find it wouldn't control my satelitte dish. I called Dish Network and was told there was no solution. It works well enough with most of my other components, but, for the price, falls short. This was my second remote, as the seller sent the wrong, less expensive model first. I had to send the other back and wait a few days for the correct one to arrive."
5,Great Product,"Love this remote. Most of the people now a days have many electronic equipments and this remote makes it really easy to control all the equipments through a single device. Although many controllers which come with tv, DVD players and cable claim to be universal, they can only perform very basic functions.This learning remote takes the 'Universal' part to a whole different level. All you need to know is the model number of your product to download all the controls to your Harmony Remote. You can even create custom buttons on the screen. I was able to even configure my projector screen controls through the remote's learning function.Lastly, it has been fun to show-off the one touch home theater function to all my friends. It dims the room lights, brings the projector screen down, turns my projector, receiver and DVD player on with corrects input settings. All I need to figure out it how to hide it from my one year old."
4,"Good function, fit and feel expected to be better.","Very nice set up through the computer, and functions well. Feel and quality of buttons not the best. Wife cannot see the screen or button labels well enough."
2,Cheap feel. Terrible buttons.,"While the Harmony 880 looks elegant, in the hand it feels like a cheap 99 cent toy as soon as you start pressing buttons. The silver buttons on the perimeter are the worst. They are tiny, with sharp edges, and difficult to discern without looking. The UP-CHANNEL button stopped working after 1 year. After much disgust, threw it out and replaced with Harmony One which has much better button layout and feel.I give it 2 stars only for ability to manage many devices, allowing to start any activity with one click.Replacing the remote was easy. All existing functionality transferred to the new remote in a few minutes via USB and a PC."
2,Is third time a charm?,"Bought one ... died approx 1 year later, got another one and .... it died approx 1 year later. Same reason as most others, it stops charging in the cradle - won't make contact. Loved it's functionality while it worked, thus 2 stars....but if I could give it a zero for durability/quality I would."
2,"Easy Setup, But Lousy Execution","I've had this remote for about two years. I love the web-based setup for the remote.The problems, though, far outweigh the good features:1) As many other reviews have stated, the charger base is junk. The connection is too finicky and/or the remote is too light to really make a solid connection. The remote just rests on the charging contacts, it doesn't snap in to help hold a connection.2) I've found the IR receiver doesn't always accept (or quickly accept) the signals from the remote.I haven't given up on Harmony/Logitech, but I've given up on this particular model."
3,same problem as the remote it replaced,"I ordered this to replace an identical remote, 2 years old. The last remote, the entire left side started shorting (?) so the volume down didn't work, and you had to press really hard to get the buttons on the left to work. The new replacement is starting to have the same problems with volume, a few months in. Clearly, a new generation remote is a better deal assuming they've fixed the problem. And of course, the buttons on this remote are pretty small, which make it awkward to use. However, the universal remote itself is just wonderful in terms of replacing all of your remotes, and the programing is simple."
4,Logitech Harmony 880,I am finally free with all the remotes lying all over the place and especially my 2 year old son is going crazy where did all those toys gone now...Logitech 880 works the way I wanted ( few software glitches)now and then..But I am very satisfied with this product..I really recommend this one.
3,Harmony Rechargeable TV Remote,"The remote is very nice. I like the rechargeable battery feature. I also own the Harmony 660 model of remote that uses replacement batteries. The rechargeable model beats the heck out of the older version, however, the buttons controlling the various features of the 880 remote are not as vivid or prominent making this model a little more difficult to use. I would prefer the 660 buttons on the 880 model. The remote does provide a good deal of control over the various components which avoids the hassle of having to deal with multiple remotes. Change the feature buttons on the 880 and it would indeed improve the utility of the remote."
5,Logitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote Control,"My wife absolutely LOVES this wonderful device. She can now operate our home theater system flawlessly with just the touch of a button. And I found it very easy to program. I did have problems getting the software to run on my 7 year old PC with 512mb RAM running Windows XP, but it worked perfectly on my relatively new Laptop with 1024mb RAM also running Windows XP. BOTTOM LINE this product is worth the price, even if you have to pay full retail. MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS REMOTE IS GETTING IT OUT OF MY WIFES HANDS."
4,Programming software is clunky and limiting,"The remote itself is very sleek and convenient, but the software to program it is very clunky and limiting. When I set up the stock 'Watch TV' activity, I found that it would set my TV to channel 3 every time, which causes a black flash. Since I never change the TV channel, I wanted to remove this step. Then I discovered that it is impossible to modify the steps performed by the stock activities. I found other similar minor annoyances. The UI for configuring the buttons is just a bunch of dropdowns, so it can be a bit difficult matching up the buttons on the remote with the dropdown entries. A graphic display of the remote would have been more helpful."
3,Remote is Beautiful but Awkward!,"Logitech Remote Control looks Awesome and works perfectly! However, the only con is that it's uncomfortable when changing channels with one hand. Specifically, the rewind,fast forward, play, and skip buttons should be more centrally located on the remote. They are currently located at the bottom of the remote and these are the buttons I use the most. I find it awkward to hold the remote with one hand and press these buttons at the same time. Otherwise this remote is tops!!"
3,Not that simple!,"As with most things sold, the instructions the company states as being simple to program simply aren't. After 3 weeks, I still can't get my components all to work with my remote."
4,Very user friendly!,This remote is so easy to use! If something does happen to go wrong it asks you questions and fixes the problem itself. I have low vision and have no problem using this remote. The bright display and colorful icons are easy to identify. It has hit the hard wood floors many times and still works great. When we first got it (about a year ago) I remember my husband spending about 2 hours programing in all of the devices. That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. We have had no problems since then.
1,"Lots of nice features, dies fast, no customer support","This remote is feature packed and easy to use, sort of what you'd expect if you're gonna blow $200 bucks on a remote control. In no time, I had it controlling all of my components and was using it with my Tivo great. The charger pretty much sucked from day one, but we eventually learned that we could put a heavy object on the remote to get it to stay charging, so that was workable. Within a year the remote was ""rebooting"" itself multiple times a day and freezing often. Logitech never returned any of my support emails. This is my second Logitech remote and both lasted under a year. I love how they work when they're working, but this is just not worth it."
4,highly recommended,"It takes a little while to setup, and you must be familiar with all of your equipment. The only thing that I would change about it is the placement of the numbers (they are at the bottom). You have to re-adjust your hand on the remote to reach the numbers. Other than that I love the remote and recommend it to all."
5,Worth EVERY penney !!,"This is really a lovely remote, and once you set it up and try using it a bit, you will fall in love with it."
4,remote,"Generally very nice remote, but here is some minuses:Shape is not comfortable to use, small buttons next to the screen are very difficult to use, You have to change hand to push this button. Next things: you have to turn off all devices before you choose new activities, otherwise per e. tv will be on wrong channel or some devices off and another not will on. And PRICE... Of course you can compare with another similar remote and price of this is not so high, but i thing, that all this staff should be much cheaper. its only REMOTE....."
2,Outdated - design flaws,I have owned this for 2 years. The first year there was a recharging issue and logitech redesigned the cradle and sent out new ones. It helped but did not completely fix the issue. Now they are not repairing these and are offering discounts on the new models. Get the Harmony One which has a better design.
2,Buggy software and a terrible battery,"I was excited when I first got this remote. It looked good and had all the features I needed to do away with all my other remote controls. The charging cradle was a real seller for me too. It had a few minor problems from the get go, such as awkward placement of a few of the buttons. The software was always a little buggy too. It would constantly ask me something like the following, ""Is your system set up correctly? Hit this button if it is -->"". No matter how many times I said yes it would ask me again the next time I powered up my components. The final straw however, was one month after the warranty expired (which is only 1 year) the battery no longer retains its charge and so the device has become virtually useless. For a device costing as much as this does, I expected a whole lot more."
5,great,bought this for my hubby for xmas. He is the techy guy works great i use the old school 3 remotes to switch to dvd player and volume buttons the screen is wonderful on the new remote easy to program and use great buy for someone aka me who is always losing the remotes. this controls our tv dvd player the surround sound and the satellite. love it.
1,Don't buy,I have a logitech remote-the setup support was great to start-however the buttons to change the channel up and down and the vol no longer work-I am back to my 3.99 Universal remote-Buy the extended plan-- the warranty is too short.
1,Don't waste your time and money,"This purchase was a huge let down. Definitely not worth the time or the money. I spent four hours trying to get this set up with a pretty simple system (two hours with a technical rep from Harmony). In the end, he couldn't help me and said he would have a level two rep call me. That didn't happen so I packaged it up and sent it back. This was not worth the money or the wasted time."
4,Nice remote,"I have had this remote for a couple years now and have enjoyed it. It took alittle bit to figure out how to program the activities, but it is nice that it can change all the settings on the different components of the entertainment system. The only downfall is that it is not bluetooth capable, therefore I still have to use a second remote when using the PS3."
2,Not impressed,"I was not happy with this remote. The buttons (especially the activity) were too small, and the remote just seemed fragile. The graphics on the color display looked goofy. The remote did operate all my components as advertised. Many people complained of the charging station and how hard it was to get the contacts to line up. I had no problem with this and everything worked fine with the charging station so maybe that complaint has been addressed. I really like my Tivo remote and just wasn't happy with the quality and layout of this remote. All in all I'm waiting for the Harmony One to drop in price a bit."
3,Slow Reaction... about 1/2 a second.,"Its a good remote, but there are some short comings with this remote:1) buttons have to be pressed hard, if not you may think its not working2) there is a delay after the press of the button. About 1/2 seconds in delay and then what you want will happen.Other than that, its pretty good.1) easy set up via web to get the codes.2) easy to customized the buttons and groupings.3) battery last about a week with normal use, about 2-3 hours of TV watching from monday to friday. About 5 hours during the weekend.4) charger blue light stays on even when not charging..GL."
4,"Great, but you need to be a geek to set it up","Once you spend a few days fiddling with the settings to get it to work exactly like you want, it's great. Really great. Even my wife can use the multi-component home theater now. But it took at least a half-dozen times of fiddling around with the settings in the software, and then re-syncing the remote to get it the way I wanted. No way someone is going to enjoy doing that unless they 1) understand how to install software and plug USB devices in to a computer, and 2) totally and completely understands every interface, input and setting on every component they want to control with the harmony.I would have given it five stars if I thought the average consumer could set it up!"
2,difficult to program,"We purchased this remote because we are not good at technical stuff and this looked like just the thing for us. We could not figure out how to set it up ourselves and so asked the professional who wired our home for surround sound to do it for us. He has done Harmony remotes before, but the ones a step down from this remote. It has taken him over 8 hours -- plus reading the manuals for our devices (all new, so that wasn't the problem)to figure out how the silly thing should be set up. We are not talking lots of complicated or extra things we are asking it to do -- just your basic commands. It is now working, except that to go from any activity to watching TV, we need to use a second remote to help it out. It ended up being way expensive and we are sorry we bought it."
1,"Bought 2, BOTH lasted less than 3 months","These remotes looked so great I bought 2 of them. The one in the family room was dead (black screen) within 2 months. I didn't do anything odd with the remote and didn't even use it very often. The one in my bedroom lasted 3 months and died with the same black screen. Again, nothing weird - just normal use.One would think a $250 remote control would last a little longer."
3,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control,"It does what it says it will very well. However, the buttons for volume and channel up/down are too small and thin and are not in an easy loccation to reach when it is in your hand."
3,Good Remote,"The best thing about this remote is that it's very easy to program. It's a lot easier than my old Phillips Pronto. However, I did not like the small buttons by the LCD. You would have to really look at the remote to press the correct button. Also, the buttons could use some improvements. Sometimes you would have to press little harder on the buttons for it to work. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
1,NEW HARMONY POLICY,"60 days for tech help starting Dec 1. If you change devices or have problems beyond that you will get zero support. When I called in because I was having technical problems the rep said ""I shouldn't even be talking to you, I should just be referring you to the internet"". This was on my first day I used my 880. Wow, I really regret giving a company that treats customers like that my money."
2,i used to love this remote,i'm so disappointed in this remote! it was great in the beginning. works with all of our appliances including our window A/C unit. after about 8 months though some of the buttons stopped working. the volume + hardly ever works as do the top screen buttons. i also think that it's poorly designed. the number buttons near the bottom of the remote are hard to get to with your thumb while holding the remote. they are also easily bumped against and pressed which is VERY aggravating. i'm always accidentally changing the station while watching something and then losing my buffer on the DVR. ugh.i'm thinking about getting a different harmony remote. will they all be like this?
5,Great Remote,"Easy to program, easy to change setup, worked with all my electronics... even an older surround sound system. My wife even liked it once I showed her how easy it was to turn everything ON or OFF using only one remote. Program it once and you are done.... unless you want to change something or add pics or background pics."
3,"great idea, too complex","Bought this for my wife, thought it would be a great idea to program her a universal remote - loved the idea of a ""help"" button. And that function worked well. But with two of us using the system at the same time (I still used my own remote) and small children doing their thing pushing buttons, the remote lost track of the system ""state"" (e.g. what was on, what was off, etc.). And the online set up was not perfect - I have a mainstream receiver (Pioneer) yet the online set up didn't have some of the input labels programmed (DVR/VCR, for example).(~$20 Sony universal took 30 minutes to program, and delighted my wife.)Pros:button layout, ""help"" button, ""automagic"" screen lighting /coming on when picked up, the promise of online/computerized set upCons:complexity of online set up and some missing selections, loss of ""state"" if other users touch the system, cost"
2,"Great software, but small unreadable buttons",The Logitech Harmony 880Logitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote Control (Black)has great software that controls all aspects of my entertainment system. But the buttons are small and frequently located around the edges putting the remote out of balance to operate with one hand. My wife can't read the small print and my daughter is ready to go back to the old multiple remote system.
4,Logitech 880 user review,"I've owned one other Harmony Remote - still use it, but it's so old, and I got the 880 for $80, thought I'd give it a try. I find it easy to use, program, and similar to my other one. Logitech software works great, I transferred my old setting into the 880 and it worked fine. I really like the tilt sensor, so the display lights up when you pick it up. Also the Favorite channels is cool - have this set up to display a series of channels in the Guide menu - so I push SHOWTIME, and it goes to the 1st Showtime channel, then shows me all other Showtime channels in the guide so I can choose which Showtime channel I want to watch. I've tried other remotes in the past, for my money, Logitech / Harmony get my vote.Scott"
4,Logitech Harmony 880,"The product is very user friendly once it is programed. The programming took a bit longer than I would have thought. But am not a techy. Just remember to keep the front of the remote pointed at the TV/receiver,cable box for a couple seconds so all the components receive the signals. (My son has the the Radio Frequency model 890 and it is a bit quicker and doesn't need to be pointed at the components. It also costs more.) The help button walks you through any problems and makes corrections if something gets out of wack. Nice product."
3,Generally pleased,"Logitech Harmony 880 Advanced Universal Remote Control (Black)We wanted one remote for our TV, satellite receiver and DVD/VCR player. This remote works for the TV and receiver as advertised, and I like its features, but I'm going to need customer service to get it to operate the DVD/VCR player, and to put in favorites on the remote screen.What I don't like about it is that I have to point the remote directly at the screen to get the channels to change, and it often backs up to the previous channel when I am inputting the new channel."
2,"Remote great, Support horrible",When I 1st setup the 880 it kept rebooting when you tried to use it. Spent hours in the technical support merry go round without resolution. Finally figured it out on my own that the battery compartment was larger than the battery. Sliver of cardboard fixed it. Recently changed a device and received connectivty errors when trying to update. Spent 3 days calling different tech departments and finally found out that Logitech locked my control by locking out updates in the warranty department. Still waiting for the promised unlock. Wish there were another comparable product other than Logitech. When it works its great.
4,"Great remote, bad charger","The remote is excellent, much better than I thought any remote control could ever perform. However, getting the remote to sit on the charger the correct way is like torture. I almost find myself not using it sometimes because I hate wrestling with the charger to make a solid connection. It would be a solid 5/5, but the charger is a total pain."
1,Two remotes two bad buttons,"Well first remote had button up bad second had fwd button bad. You had to push real hard as compared to rest of the buttons to make it work. That alone was unbearable for use with DVRs we have. Seems 880 has flimsy design of the button pad. On top of it, this remote buttons are so plentiful and small that all advantage of having one remote is gone. By the time you figure out what to press you better of having multiple remotes with better ergonomics. I'm just returning the second remote for refund now. Also there is quite a lag in button response, but I did not investigate closer, there might be an option to set the delay for each device or button in the setup. Only good experience was programming the remote via USB. 550 might be a better way to go, might give 550 a try."
4,fantastic customer service,"i love this remote but have had problems setting it up correctly. the customer service at logitech is fantastic. they respond to e-mails within hours and because of the interface of this remote, they were even able to program it remotely for me and fix whatever problems i had. i cannot praise logitech's customer service anymore highly. and once the remote is properly programmed, it works wonderfully. goodbye 7 remotes - hello 1!!"
4,Money well spent,"I use this remote to control a Samsung 650 series 52"" LCD TV, Cable box, Samsung Bly-Ray and a Yamaha Sound Projector. I was a little concerned that the YSP might not work with this remote but it did. Set up was simple all you need is the brand name and model of your devices. I accidently inverted one of the numbers of the model number for the TV and the software corrected it for me. Install the software and input that info into it and it does the rest. Tip: Do not unplug the remote from the USB connection until all of the info has been sent to it. I was instructed to remove it to early, but I was able to plug it back in and it finished installing without having to re-enter info. I like the fact that it has a re-chargeable base and the back lite keys. I had to adjust the touch screen as it was to sensitive to my touch. It's much easier now with one remote rather than four. Even my tech challenged wife can use it."
4,"works fine, but a little slow","I like the ability to program ANY button. However, sometimes it is a little slow when sending commands to my TIVO."
2,Good idea bad quality,"I had a Logitech 880 remote and was happy with it at first with the exception of the remote not fitting properly in the charger. It would only charge if you fiddled with it quite a bit. Extremely frustrating. A rechargable remote seemed like a good idea at first but turned out to be more of a problem. Then the ""0"" key stopped working. And the reboot problem would happen occasionally. The remote didn't last very long.I liked the remote but it didn't seem very well built or designed. I've since replaced it with a much cheaper Logitech 550 remote and am much happier. It doesn't have a recharger (uses 4 AAA batteries), all the buttons are working and it has never rebooted. It also uses the same setup program.I don't recommend the 880 but do recommend the less expensive 550 remote."
2,Disappointed...,"I know everyone loves these remotes but have to say we will not be buying it again. Again you say??? Yes, after spending $250 plus, we're throwing it out. The buttons have, one-by-one, stopped working and the thing is now useless to us. Granted we've had it for 2 years, but heck, at this price, it should last a lot longer than that."
4,Works great - now,"Instructions very vague. If only it was as easy as putting in the model numbers and away we go. Model of my cable box was not recognized so ""we"" had to do some fancy maneuvering. ""Exit"" and ""Guide"" along with a few other buttons were not working. Also in the DVD it would not recognize the ""fast forward"" and ""rewind"" although it was input correctly. For a while I was disappointed going back and forth from cable and dvd remotes. My friend (who has this remote) talked me through (on the phone) how to use the ""learn command"" for the dvd buttons and we re-programmed the cable box remote using another model number. Now everything is perfect (including lights) and all other remotes are put away."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!,I purchased three of these remote from Amazon - two new and one refurbished unit.The two new units have both essentially died at about one year use.One of the units the buttons are failing and the other unit constantly resets.I recently purchased the Harmony One and have been happy with it (so far).
2,great remote but buttons no longer work,"I've been a big harmony supporter for serveral years. I love the concept but these remotes have flaws. My first harmony ate through batteries. As a birthday gift I received an 880 and thought it solve all my problems. But now that I've owned it for 1.5 years the buttons have stopped functioning properly. All the important ones (activities, channel up/down, volume, help) require multiple key presses. It's extremely annoying that this remote has such a short lifespan. I'm not sure what my next univeral remote will be, but I'm having second thoughts about a new harmony."
3,Disposable,"It's a very good product for the first year. However, after the first year the buttons will begin to degrade fast. Anything that cost more than $100 usd you'd expect to last at least 4 years. This is my second remote 880 'cuz ALL my house systems are already automatized with it, but in no way I'd buy the more expensive versions.So functionality is very good, quality quite poor."
3,Great concept and software ruined by cheap hardware,"For remotes that cost around $100, the Harmony series has always had incredibly flaky hardware, but the 880 sets a new low bar. I'm on my third 880 through warranty swaps, but you only have to hold one to know how cheap the hardware is. I've had buttons fall completely off, and some of them you can hardly tell if you've pushed them they have so little action. The Harmony software and concept is still excellent, the charger is great (as opposed to swapping out AAAs), but the remote itself is not worth your money.I'd recommend either saving some money and getting something in the 5xx or 6xx series, or if you really want the color screen, pony up a little more for the Harmony One. The 880 just isn't worth the money.It's also worth noting that the remote I bought from Warehouse Deals, Inc through Amazon was marked as new, but what I got was clearly not a new product and was, in fact, broken (Logitech replaced it)."
4,Great but sad it died...,"This remote is awesome! I got it for my husband last Christmas and he was in love. It made it so he could add component after component to our TV system and I would not hate him for making it too complicated to watch TV that I would just give up. This made it so I didn't have a thousand remotes sitting around the living room. But then, one sad day, the remote died. The screen looked like it stabbed and was hemorrhaging. When we contacted customer service they said it was not covered under warranty and offered no help for repairs. So, sadly, this family that is down one income to being laid off really misses having the super remote but probably wouldn't recommend it to a house with kids unless they aren't allowed to touch it! :)"
5,Harmony 880,I love this remote so far. It took a few programing trips on the computer to get the settings the way I want but that's the best thing about it. It's programing and features let you do just about anything. If you have more then one remote to run all of your HT gear do yourself a favor and get one of these. As long as you know how to turn a computer on you can program this remote. Yes it's that easy.
3,Great remote but not sure how long buttons will continue to work...,"I am happy with this remote. It works great. Problem I am seeing after one year of use is, the Channel Up button is not working as expected. I have to press it really hard before I can actually change the channel. And I am sure it is going to happen with all similar buttons such as Ch-, Vol+, Vol-, Prev, Mute."
2,was great until...,I loved this remote until a recent software update caused the media function to no longer work. I bought this to control a 400 dvd player and that function is now inoperable. Logitech has said they would restore this in the next software update but it has been 4 months so far without an update. Disappointed.
1,After 1 yr. buttons are a dud!,"Started out loving this remote - great color display, seemed to work fine. Only one year into using this remote the volume (up and down) buttons stopped working. About the same time, the number buttons began sticking and posting multiple presses. ( ie: entering 55 instead of 5) Lastly, the charger deck NEVER worked properly. You constantly have to tap it and tap it and wait to see if it'll engage for recharging. I can see why the initial users give this item good reviews. But, for a longtime owner... it becomes a big waste of money. If you want a disposable remote that lasts for about 1 year - this is your remote."
3,Logitech Harmony 880,"When it updates, is not consistant on how the some functions will work. Proably a fix, but haven't found it yet. Overall, I'm pleased with the way it works."
3,Not Senior Citizen Friendly,"This product does all it purports to do, however, if your eyesight isn't what it used to be, you might have some problems reading the message window or the one touch buttons. Many gadgets today are miniturized to the point of being difficult for older folks to handle easily. Such is the case here."
1,Remote Battery Has Died,The remote battery died within two weeks. Unfortunately I didn't read all the reviews to realize that this is a big problem for this remote. I am sending it back.
2,For the first month it worked great! Now it won't even turn on.,"For the first month it worked great! Now it won't even turn on. I have not yet attempted to return, if this works out without any hassles, I will change this review. However, at this very moment, I am very disappointed!"
1,Flimsy,The quality is poor. From the very beginning the contacts of many buttons started to fail and I had to reprogram the thing to circumvent that. The battery life became shorter and shorter until I was unable to charge the remote. Don't buy this remote control. I suggest the simpler - and cheaper - model 650 from Harmony
3,Great concept but . . .,"Mine had a software glitch so it was returned. The charging base does not perfectly conform to the remote's underside or securely hold the remote in place to allow consistent charging. Although only used for a very short time, the device is extremely versatile and not too difficult to program."
1,Bad Charging System,"I have owned this remote for a year and a half. It worked fine the first few months and then it became hard to charge. I cleaned the contacts and that would help for a few weeks. It then started resetting whenever I would pick it up too fast or bump it. I continued to have problems with it not charging and resetting. Now it doesn't work at all. I can't get it to charge at all.I would just like to warn people that as others have said in their reviews, this unit has real problems with charging. I think you would be better off buying a unit that uses rechargeable double or triple A's. I also have the Logitech 659 and so far haven't had any troubles with it. Too bad about the 880."
3,Pretty Decent remote for the money,"I bought this product for $100 on sale. Pretty good, I love the activity function because it turns all the components on the right input and such. I like how the settings are online and you can update the remote from pretty much and computer. I do feel though that the buttons are a little awkward and some of them too small. It is a nice compact size, but I guess I still have to get used to it. It was definitely worth the price of $100 though. Not worth the full retail price"
1,does not work,will not operate all of my components as advertized. still have to switch input on tv manually.
4,It works,"I have a Sony LCD, a Tivo/DireTV box, a Mac Mini and a Kenwood receiver. Getting it all working properly took some work but I'm officially down to one remote- AV nirvana. My wife is thrilled.I only wish the set up applicaiton was a little better. It's a web app, which makes it a little clunky. I also think some of the questions can be out of context or not offer an option that I'm looking for. They are so close to making this a slam dunk.That said I can now switch between TV and the Mac with one button and control everything within those environments with this remote.I called tech support on a Saturday morning and got help without a wait.So far so good on this one."
4,"Great Product, with just one small flaw","Very easy to configure, and when it doesn't work right the first time, easy to fix.I love the macros. Pressing one button to go from watching TV to watching a DVD not only turns on the DVD player, but also the surround sound receiver, and switches the TV input to DVD. When done, pressing ""watch TV"" shuts off the DVD player and the receiver and switches the input to HDMI. Now, if only it would eject and put away the DVD. Maybe in future versions. :-)One flaw, which has been mentioned here before, is that the buttons are small and too close together. I wouldn't say I have fat fingers, but I have managaged to fast forward my Tivo many, many times, when all I wanted to do was pause. However, it's a small flaw, and it might be a little annoying, but given that I no longer have 7 remotes all over the place, it doesn't bother me too much.All in all, really worth the money."
1,"Junk remote, poor quality","Buttons stopped working after less than a month, some only worked intermittently when new, (automated) product support not helpful at all, all they did was provide instructions on how to program the keys. Stay away from this or just dump the $150 in the trash can and save time."
1,Remote never worked,"Went through the setup without too much difficulty. Annoying at many points, but not awful. However, the remote was never able to send a signal to any device. Tried setup again a couple times and tried using it on multiple different devices. I have to believe the IR transmitter on the remote just didn't work at all. A big disappointment. To make it worse, tech support has horrible hours and I was never able to get ahold of them before I just gave up and returned it. Amazon was wonderful about the return, though. Fast, full refund including the 2 day shipping cost. Considering the buttons and screen were extremely small and it uses a rechargeable battery with a bulky cradle, I think I'll look around for a different product."
2,logitech 880,The only thing that would work is the volumn on the plasma TV. I removed the program from the computer and will download it all over again.Maybe it might work this time.
2,Logitech 880 vs DishNetwork remote,"880 pros: rechargeable battery; activity window; fast help response.cons: 1. buttons small, recessed, as opposed to DNW protruding controls.2. Remote ""fixes"" recording light after each session by asking, ""Is it off now?"" On DNW remote, each activity can be controlled separately.3. Even with technicians help, lengthy installation of remote info.4. Double the cost of a replacement DWN remoteVerdict: DishNetWork users should NEVER switch to Logitech 880"
2,hard to set up,I got it and had a sony blue-ray and and sony lcd plus a comcast cable box. The tv kept on being turn off when switching from box to dvd player. To many button to chage settings. Could be simpler. Be aware....poor support
2,"Sucked, returned","Wanted a remote that would work well with my Vip622 DVR from dish network. Transport controls are poorly placed, and should be raised so that you fingers can easily find them without looking. Also, unit was partially defective. Didn't program completely."
4,Remote is pretty good,I bought this remote a few weeks ago. It was easy to program and has worked well. No complaints.
2,trouble with PVR,"when first purchased I was very pleased with this remote. I felt that although programming took a few tries due to unique settings on some of my components as well us understanding the lingo of the various selections, once programmed it worked very well.It can get confused if any components are turned on or off manually, the Remote has no way of knowing what the actual status of the components is and you may have to manually reset all components prior to using the remote.However, the remote has started to have major issues with my Dishnetwork DVR, the DVR is not responding correctly (works fine with the DVR remote), does not respond at all or requires double presses of buttons for response. The most frustrating issue is the lack of support from Logitech. Very little personalized customer support. The CS is all done through email and they keep telling me it is fixed when it is not.I would not purchase again."
4,Harmony 880,"Remote was purchased to control an Onkyo TX-SR606 receiver, Hughes satellite tv box, Panasonic; DMP-BD35, DMR-EA18, 50"" plasma. The software to program is easy to use and the remote worked as advertised. The only problem was the two Panasonic DVD players use the same IR codes, so when the remote would try to control one of the players, both would respond. A call to the Logitech Support Center resulted in the level 2 technician determining that the only solution was to purchase either the Harmony 890 or Harmony 1000 models. Since these transmit via RF, it would be possible to diffrentiate between the two. I sold the 880 to a freind and purchased the 890. I set up the 890 and it's working fine."
2,Does NOT control all devices--only 3 out of 5 devices worked with the Harmony,"I was optimistic about the Harmony Remote because I took Logitech's ""Remote Test Drive"". During the ""Test Drive"", all of my components were listed and would appear to work with the Harmony. Unfortunately, after I bought the remote and found the devices not working, Logitech said they do not have the codes for these particular devices. One device was an iPod with the IR dock and the other was an older AV Receiver. Additionally, the software was cumbersome and the ergonomics of the remote are fair at best--the channel and volume buttons are small and curved which makes them uncomfortable to use. If you have the original remotes for ALL of your devices, the Harmony can learn from them. Overall, I am disappointed in Logitech's Harmony remote. I would not recommend this remote!"
2,Don't waste you time with this one,"Bought the Harmony 880 on the recommendation of an acquaintance. Maybe it works well for him, but I've tried everything possible to get this remote to work correctly with my system, but it refuses to do so.Tried contacting Logitech support via email and NEVER received a response, troubleshooting in the remote and bundled software didn't help at all. Tried training it with the 4 remotes it takes to run everything in my system and had only limited success. I can turn the Tivo on and access the menus, but could not get pause, stop, and FF functions to work on the 880!If you have a Samsung TV, keep looking, the Harmony 880 is not capable of correctly changing inputs for various functions. No matter what I did, I had to fall back to changing inputs with the TV remote, and the whole purpose of the exercise was to be able to use just a single remote to control all the components in the system. Not going to happen with this one..."
2,The button layout is awful,"This remote is fantastic in the way it operates your equipment, but the button layout is all wrong. Especially if you're using a TiVo, I do not recommend this remote. The fast forward and rewind buttons are in the wrong places and are VERY difficult to operate with one hand. I bought this remote and have returned it, in favor of the Harmony 550. That remote doesn't have a color screen or rechargeable batteries, which sucks, but the layout of the buttons is much better."
4,I love this remote,I see on these boards that some people have had problems with this remote. I have not. I love this thing. I've put all my other romotes away. I do feel that the buttons are not ideally placed and therefor gave it four instead of five stars.
3,Logitech Harmony 880,"In general, I found the remote easy to program. The remote works almost flawlessly when it comes to setting up predetermined activities. That is a big plus for convenience and other family members. The problem I am experiencing is dealing with specifics, ie., it lacks some functionality with the DVR box, and is inconsistant about including full functionality of some components - can't do anything with the A/V Receiver except the pre-programmed settings, for instance, you can't switch inputs. Also, even though it recognized my DVD Recorder/Player, it doesn't include recording functionality in the remote, it just wants to give you a ""Watch DVD"" activity. The programing site doesn't seem to have much to say. The bottom line is, for the most common activities, it works. You will still need to keep your specific remotes at hand or do the manual setups. I'm glad I didn't pay anywhere near the list price, because it is still way overpriced at $142.-"
3,Does what it says it does,"Overall, a very functional universal remote. Love the activity based buttons. Setup was actually pretty easy, unlike what some others have written. Recognized my Samsung TV, Motorola DVR, Toshiba DVD, and Onkyo A/V Receiver right away. Could execute all the functions as well. Some specific actions, like ""Watch DVR"", ""On Demand"" etc can be very easily configured to show up on the LCD screen. The docking station to recharge the battery is pretty cool too.However, at times, the remote doesn't turn on all the devices. When you press, ""Watch TV"" for example, it might turn on the TV and A/V Receiver, and not the DVR. Then you'll have to go thru the ""Help"" menu to fix it. Also, the battery life could have been a little longer, and the button placements a little more intuitive.Overall, a decent remote for the money."
3,Buttons don't work well,"This remote suceeded in reducing the number of remotes we have laying around, but overall we are disappointed with the purchase. We have been terribly frustrated with the responsiveness of the buttons, and the ergonomics of button placement. We still use our original TiVo remote for TiVo controls because it is so much easier to press FF, REW, & PLAY buttons and Tivo responds better.I don't think this is worth the money."
2,"Poor button layout, horrible customer service","The remote I received had a defect with the charging station. Not all of the pins were the same height so contact wasn't being made with the remote and therefore it wouldn't charge. I have had 3 phone calls with logitech and now 3 weeks have gone by and I still do not have a replacement remote.Second, this remote claims to help with complicated DVR setups, but the buttons for play, pause, and fastforward are just mixed in with the others and difficult to find if not looking at the remote. I wish that the buttons were laid out more like the TiVo remote."
5,It does what I meant for it to do,"Before I got this device, I referred to my stack of remotes as my ""own personal, private hell."" Getting Harmony 880 was a great move. I followed the instructions for identifying all the devices I use (Cox DVR, a DVD player, audio sysetm, VHS) and within minutes it was performing almost perfectly. The ""almost"" part was shored up in the next round of fine-tuning, making certain that the commands I most use were easily at hand.But the real test came last night, when I handed it over to Susan. She looked at it, clicked the button for watching cable, and did fine. She's not a techie, but she does after all deserve to be able to watch TV or DVDs without a major brain freeze, or hunting up a handful of different remotes.The only device that wasn't on the pre-defined list was my Squeezebox 3. I could, I suppose, manually program it, but instead I think I'll drop a line to Logitech support and hope they'll add it!"
4,"Good Product, but...","The product works as advertised, but the set-up software needs to have more options supporting detailed settings. Basic set-up is simple but, in my case anyway, was insufficient to do what I wanted. Getting to the tools I needed is somewhat counter intuitive. You can get there, but it takes some exploring. My remote had a problem learning commands from my Dish network remote but not other remotes. That kind of problem may inevitable.Best universal remote around, but not perfect."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this item on amazon because of price. It arrived very quickly and I was very excited. Well, me and my husband opened it and started programing the item via internet. Everything was fine until we put it on the charger..My item would not hold a charge... It would say it is fully charged but soon as you take it off the charger NO BARS!!!!! Maybe we just had a bad product but I was not happy and refused to get another!!!!!!!!!"
4,High praise for Logitech Harmony 880,"This is an absolutely an unbelievably great device. I was doubtful but ordered it anyway because of the difficulty of having to deal with 4 remotes. It works as good as advertised, with a few small glitches. I can't get all of the remotes to be reproduced EXACTLY, but that is relatively minor. Each ""activity"" works flawlessly, e.g., watch TV, watch DVD, etc. All of the correct devices are properly activated. Even XM radio which didn't even come with a remote! I recommend this device highly."
4,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control,"Great product! I only give it 4 stars instead of 5, because I feel the software could be a little more user friendly."
1,DON'T BUY IT !,"I have bought now two of those. it looks perfect on the first months but it have a big design problem. The battery charger stop to work !!!! i have 2 of those now, once the first get the problem i tought it was a isolated problem, on the next i got the exact same problem.. google it and you will see . big problem and you will have to loose all the work you done to configure it and also the remote !."
4,Good Product,"This is my first universal remote and I was presently surprised that it does everything it says it will. I especially like the rechargeable base. The only negative is that I cannot get it to operate the Sony Blu Ray disc player that I bought at [...]. I think this is a special model that is only sold at [...] and I couldn't find it on the website to download. A pain, but not that big of one. Overall, I am satisfied."
2,Piss Poor,This was a great remote except for all the problems I had with it.. I had such high expectations. I had patience wiht it when it would not listen to my commands. It woudld just stop responding sometimes with the only fix action beign to remove the battery and start all over again. Maybe this is just a falty unit. When it does work it is golden. Turns all 5 devices on when it shoudl and turns all others off when it should.. When it doesnt make sure you have your old remotes on stand by..
5,Fantastic Device!,"This is truly an amazing product. I have no idea why some have given it unfavorable reviews. Simply put, it eliminated ALL of my remotes! Every function of each of my home-entertainment gadgets was loaded in to the Harmony via their internet-based software. It took about 15 minutes to enter my information and it worked perfectly the first time I tested it. I use a DirecTV DVR and was concerned that this remote might not have all the functions I enjoy with the DVR remote. I was pleased to be wrong about that. It did every single function of the remote. I went back to make some minor tweaks after giving the remote a full test drive. Tweaking was simple and took a mere minutes through the software. The shortcut macros you can create are highly customizable and simple to setup. If you have multiple remotes, this little wonder will improve you life."
4,Very Pleased,I am very happy with this product. It works very well. It is complicated to set up. But that is because it must work with so many different devices and there are a multitude of options that must be accomodated. The only improvement I would like is for it to automatically come back to the main menu after it has turned on appliances.
4,Harmony 880,"It works great most of the time , sometimes it gets confused and turns on or off the wrong equiptment"
4,Easy to use Harmony 880,The Harmony 880 works well. I have 6 devices to manage and it works pretty well. It took me a little time to configure the remote but it was not impossible. I love the feature that the backlit comes on when the remote control is moved.
4,Excellent Product,"This remote is a must for people with complex home theater setups. I have a Samsung Plasma TV, a Samsung Home Theater system, a Panasonic Blu Ray Player, a Comcast Set top Box and an Apple TV. It is seriously so easy to set this remote up. It guides you through a list of questions and drills down to your exact product. Be sure to have exact model numbers on hand.Also, I was able to customize the exact wording of each ""Activity"".Another feature that is great is if you use the remote to say ""Watch a DVD"" and something goes wrong, all you do press ""help"" and it will ask you questions until everything works. My parnter who is as computer illiterate as they come can even get the system working."
4,You and Your family will love this remote,"This is the best remote brand in the industry, I like this remote because it comes with the charger. I own the 890 that works through walls, but I also own this one down stairs. There is a help buttin if something is not working right, I even have had house guest be able to run my system without any instruction from me. I LOVE THESE REMOTES!"
4,Great Product,"I have worked in Home Automation and let me tell you, the Harmony can be a blessing or a curse. There are other companies out there that will give you remotes that do similar things for less, but none are as easy to set up. If you have a simple system and a computer, this remote will knock your socks off. All you have to do is tell it what components you have and it does almost everything else. If you have anything complicated that requires something the software doesn't expect, you are going to bang your head against the wall for hours. I bought this for my brother-in-law who has one of those DVD/Surround sound in a box things. Well, for some reason during activity changes, it would turn off the Surround Sound. This caused quite a headache and they stopped using it all together. Guess when he springs for real AV equipment I'll reprogram it. Until then, my sister can't watch TV without calling him."
5,Hands down best remote!,"I liked mine so much, I got one for my son-in-law. I bought mine a while ago at Best Buy and paid $225!! I have had other universal remotes but with my setup I still had to have a couple of the original remotes on the table to control everything. Plus, my wife couldn't do anything but turn the TV on. After the simple set up, it controled every function of every component and I was able to put all my other remotes away in the cupboard. In fact, all the normal day-to-day functions, like watching satellite through the TV and watching a DVD with the sound being controled by my audio/video receiver, are only a single push of a button. Now my wife can listen to her favorite CD without asking me for help!"
3,Overkill yet lacking,"I replaced my logitech 550 with this remote and found it lacking what I really like about my 550. First the backlight on the buttons is a joke. I can hardly even see what's lit up. Second the buttons feel cheap, hard plastic, I prefer the 550's rubber buttons that become completely lit. Third the 880 also has no rubber backing, which I also liked on the 550. The lcd on the remote is nice but its grainy and I feel, not needed. It might add to the cool factor for some and was part of what made me buy it, that and I caught it on sale for 79.99. I am now sending this remote back and sticking with the 550. It does everything I need."
3,"My 3rd Harmony 880 With ""Issues""","First of all, from functionality POV, this has been the best remote I've ever had. It's highly programmable and flexible. Although I love it, Harmony has TERRIBLE build and design problems in the 880.Logitech has replaced the unit three times under warranty, each time due to key failure. Also, be aware as well that the cradle connection is VERY flaky. Expect continuing annoyances on that front.Since I'm out of warranty, Logitech offered me a 50% discount on a replacement unit. A lot better than nothing but I paid a hefty price when I originally bought it and it's a shame to have to spend more money on a solution I already had in my hand.I would strongly suggest that those considering the Harmony 880 or 890 look towards something else. I'm going to order a Harmony One."
5,Better than asprin to take care of a headache.,"This remote is well worth the money. I have a large screen tv, cable box w/dvr, dvd surround sound, and my xbox all working perfectly with this remote. I also set it to control my fan. It is so easy to use, the ""help"" function right on the remote can fix almost any issue you encounter. I do believe this could save a marriage also, my wife can push 1 button to watch a DVD and then just push another when she changes here mind ands wants to watch the regular cable. There is no need for multiple remotes and she isn't intimidated by all the electronics I MUST have."
4,My husband loves it,My husband loves this man toy. A great gift for any guy with a complex stero system. I like it because I don't have to press a zillion buttons to just watch a DVD.
4,"A good remote, but far from perfect.","I don't ask for much. I don't need all the fancy little proprietary buttons for each of my five remotes to work. I just need the basics. For the most part, the Harmony delivers. Every now and then though, the Harmony faulters and I have to take it back to the computer and mess around with it. It was working properly before, but for some reason, which I still cannot pinpoint, it will regress to some non- functioning state."
4,Cool idea. Good service from Amazon,"Easy to use software to program the remote, although programing the buttons exactly the way you may want them is tedious. The remote was new, but had a defective button. Amazon shipped a new one immediately before I returned the defective one using Amazon's prepaid UPS return label. Great service from Amazon, and the cheapest price I could find on the net."
5,Great Remote,"The remote is really easy to use, works great, and is attractive. I can't comment on programming it--someone else did that for me."
3,"Save up for the ""Harmony One"" Instead","I've had the Harmony 880 for almost a year. It does what it's supposed to do... it replaced a total of six branded remotes in my home system. That's the good news. Unfortunately, after awhile, you'll discover the most-used buttons, like the volume up-down or the channel up-down, are small, thin, and have strong back-springs which make it difficult to press the button(s). When I first read about the new Harmony One, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. Everything that was good about the Harmony 880 was also built into the Harmony One, its shape seems to fit better into either left or right hand, and the new version has larger everyday buttons in a more logical arrangement. A huge improvement. But the current clearance price for the 880 is a good deal, too."
2,"good product, but.........","This remote works reasonably well, however, when placed in it's cradle, which is also it's charger the slightest of movement will set it a beeping, constantly.....Annoying is not the word for this irritating quirk, indeed I have slammed it many times in the cradle to stop it from beeping.It is so sensitive that walking across the room will induce a symphony of beeps, you have been warned !"
1,Poor Design and Quality,"I bought the 880 to replace my 659. The 880 is a very poor quality and was only designed for looks and not function. The only good thing is the color display. The buttons are too close together, have a cheap feel and lack tactile feedback. Sometimes the numbers work sometimes not. I reloaded the software but no effect. I now know why there was a rebate. Unfortunately I can't get a refund because I sent the UPC for the rebate. Buy the 659 it is by far a better design. The buttons are better spaced and provide tactile feedback."
4,Debs review,"I was apprehensive at first, because the reviews on this product were mixed. I like this remote, It is time consuming to program, but it works well and the on-line download was a big help. Thanks"
2,No humans used in the deveopment of this product,"This device lacks any sort of design for the human hand. Certain buttons are just not reachable without dropping the device or using both hands. The power charger is designed to NOT charge your device unless you use a rubber band and strap it around the base station and the clicker. Let's face it, there are only 3 real options of programming, SAT, CABLE, and Broadcast. Why can't these devices be take that into consideration? Button controls should be simple as in the case of a SAT controller, but no. They design the system to be a programmers play thing. I already have a play thing...kids...which cannot use this device because the buttons ar put together in a fashion that you have to be exactly in the right position to push the button. Designers of this device failed, but ""guts"" are great."
5,The Best,"The Harmony 880 is one of the best remotes I have ever used. It is simple to operate and easy to install all your devices that require a remote , including the ceiling fan."
4,Harmony 880,The 880 is very easy to setup and program. I have several devices and multiple activities and so far the remote controls everything to my satisfaction. I should note that I'm currently using a replacement due to a malfunction with my original. I called customer service at Logitech and after some troubleshooting they shipped a new remote within about a week.
5,Bought as Present for Parents,"I bought this as a present for my parents. When my mom had little trouble setting up and operating the remote (she is an average computer user), I knew this was a quality product designed to work with anyone. Great job!"
4,Mother of all remotes?,"Not without some quirks, but it has pretty well replaced all other remotes that I use. Buttons are small and not easy to access in the dark. Interface with internet is very handy and works fairly well...allows for ""tweeking"". Recharging is a great feature! Overall, I am satisfied with this remote and I would recommend it."
3,Buttons stick,"I've had this remote for 2 years and use it everyday. It works and does it's job but after a few minutes the buttons became harder and harder to push down. They still work but sometimes stick. The remote is also not the most durable remote in the world. It fell off the couch onto our tile floor and the usb port busted off so I can not reprogram it again. Its my fault for knocking it off the couch, but it broke way too easily."
2,Great potential.... if it worked,"I've had the remote for a couple of years. About a year ago, it simply ""forgot"" certain commands like ""volume up"" and ""stop"" on the DVD player. I connected it to the PC again to update firmware and recheck the settings but to no avail. Now I have to keep my audio receiver remote nearby for anytime I want to turn up the volume. I guess 2 remotes is better than 4 but it's LAME and not why I bought this thing. Really disappointing!!!"
3,Good but doesn't last long,"Great features on the remote - the whole ""activities"" thing is something that Logitech absolutely gets right.However, like all Logitech remotes, this only has a lifetime of under two years before breaking. I bought this in December 2009 and in September 2011 two of the buttons stopped working. It was the second Logitech remote that I had bought - the earlier one had similar issues. Worked great and then broke. Logitech is good enough that I bought another one to replace this, but this time theLogitech Harmony 700 Rechargeable Remote with Color Screenbecause if they have such a short lifetime, I don't want to spend so much."
4,"Great Remote, but beware of the geek factor","This is a super multi-function remote. I find the buttons a little hard to read, but overall, ONCE I got it set up it has been a solid performer.However, setting it up can be a chore if you have a complex TV / Theater set up. There is a nice PC interface, but it took me hours of tweaking to get it right. The interface stores your settings on line and offers software updates. The logic behind the PC interface is sometimes convoluted, but it can b understood with some patience.Overall, if you can tolerate the learning curve to get the set up going, then buy this remote. It works very well."
1,REALLY not worth it!,"If you just dropped some major cash on a new home theater system and are thinking (like I did) that $180 on a sweet looking remote to rule them all would be worth it, trust me it's not. This thing will fall apart, or stop charging just like it did on mine and two of my friends who bought the same one.I have to clean the leads off with an alcohol q-tip every week for it to charge. pain in the....You would think for $180, logitech would have a better warranty policy. Nope. It's one year. Just enough time for it to fall apart.good luck in your search."
3,Nice remote but doesn't last,"Well I am finally done with this remote. It works great, but the build quality is very low.My second remote died today (this is my 3rd Logitech remote to die) and I refuse to purchase another.The programability is great an if spending this kind of money every year on a replacement remote is okay with you then go for it. However I am not.I also second that the charging base for this is stupid. It is a real pain to get the remote to sit in the cradle properly to charge."
4,pretty good,"I like it. It does everything that I expected it to do and even a little more. It's sometimes just a little slow (and yes, I adjusted the reaction times) but I am not worried about that because the benefits totally outweigh that."
3,"A good remote, needing some work.","Fairly easy to setup -still not as automatic as you would think with so many of these devices out there and with it all being web enabled. Not as ergonomic as the Home Theater Master remotes, but those are much more difficult to setup (MX-500 is still a beautiful design). One handed use is a little difficult as the remote slides around in your hands and the number buttons are awkwardly placed on the bottom. IR emitters are also not as strong as the Home Theater Master remotes. I look forward to a time when Logitech allows you to save multiple profiles and provides more ""pre-setup"" layouts that similiar users can share (it is all web based so that should be an option soon)."
5,Love my new Logitech Harmony 880,"Ease of set up was most impressive. Clear, rational, straight-forward. Learning curve for the wife and adolescents was short."
5,Overall a great remote,"I qualify everything I say with the fact that I am not a videophile or tech junkie. I have 5 compnents hooked up to the remote. It took awhile to get them all to work properly. It was frustrating at first because the buttons would not do what they were suppose to. It took some trial and error. Some of it was my fault some was Logitech's fault. When I went to program one of the buttons for the T.V., the drop down menu Logitech provided did not have the button name I needed. That is where the trial and error came in. I just had to try different things until I found one that matched. Eventually, a couple of hours later, I got the remote to work just fine with everything. It is awesome now that I have the bugs worked out of it. So nice to have just one remote. I was given this as a gift so I did not look into any other remotes. My wife did all the research. I wish the buttons were a little bigger and easier to read. I think you will be happy with this remote. I know I am."
3,Worked on 5/6 of my components,"Pros--Looks great, the LCD screen is pretty slick.--Works pretty well for the most part, worked on 5/6 of my components.--The software was maybe a 7-8 on a scale of 0-10 in regards to simplicity/setup. I guess the loading/syncing portion of setup annoyed me, took a bit longer than I expected.Cons--Pretty complicated for someone who doesn't deal with electronics, A/V stuff.--I ended up giving this to my brother because I couldn't get it to work with my Mitsubishi 65"" HDTV. It wouldn't change to the right A/V Source.--Only IR, my setup is in the corner, and I'm on the opposite side of the room, so it was a hassle to get the sensors to line up.--Buttons felt cheapConclusionI probably wouldn't buy this again since I now know it doesn't work well with my tv, it was an impulse buy and I would definitely need a remote that used RF or BT.Before you buy this, think long and hard if you really NEED to spent $100+ on a remote."
5,great buy,"Great purchase. The delay of the signal was a little aggrivating until I found that you can change the time between the pushing the commands to the time it sent them to the receivers. After fixing that, AWESOME product. Even my fiance likes the remote and is easy to use for her too. And she's not tech savy at all. All in all, it is a must buy for a home theater system."
4,Keeps going in Testing Mode once in a while!. Otherwise Still works.,"I love it!. Very Easy to set-up. Updating it once every 2-3 weeks does seem to help resolve issues. Set-up is done by going to Logitech site and creating a profile under your user-name. From ther-on it installs the Client Software on your machine and updates the remote when you need. Also,Logitech just changed its Setup Web Site with a new front-end interface with Colorful Buttons that invoke different Actions which is far better than 1 month ago. The old set-up screens were very confusing. Overall, I still love it!."
1,Not for xbox or PS3,It wasn't intuitive and it doesn't work with PS3 and you need to get a firmware update for xbox. The layout is ok but not as good as my dish controller. The setup for my receiver seemed to be hard at best.
1,Harmony 880 Remote Control,"My son-in-law recommended it based on one that he owned and used. I just wanted to consolidate the operation of 2 remotes for an Akai 32"" LCD TV/DVD combo and a Scientific Atlanta HD/DVR box from my cable provider. I spent about three hours fooling with it and trying to set it up then packed it up and returned it. I could not get it to handle the most basic functions from the two remotes (like turning the TV on and off). Although my son-in-law likes his and I spent about half of what he did for mine, I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Low on frustration? Then buy this!,"Great looking product, nice packaging, great idea of setting up your equipment and task list on the internet. Too bad it doesn't actually work. Too bad it isn't supported.I will continue trying to get this blasted piece or art to talk with my computer but I only have so long before I have to decide to return it as defective junk. I'll post another review if I ever manage to get it to work and what the magic was."
3,Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control,"This is a good product, it does help[ out with the remote control mania. However, to get the full use of the product, full knowledge of your system components and programing the remote control are necessary to fully utilize the remote. I have not been able to get to that point yet. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to get to this level of usage?"
2,pretty disappointed,"Until now, everything I ever bought from Logitech had delighted me. This one did at first but after a little bit of use, I think this will sit around and collect dust until I throw it away.A remote needs to be able to let you FF/REW in a responsive way. This thing is slow and the buttons are darned hard to find without looking. I need to keep my eyes on the TV, not to be staring at the remote to find the right button.The button feel sucks.Device support isn't nearly as good as I had expected.What a disappointment."
1,"Don't bother with this remote, it is a waste of time.","Others rave about the 880. They must not have complicated AV systems. The first fault is that in comes with version software 4.4 when 7.2 is the latest. The remote is programed on line and Logitech's site is slow. I have a 7 input HD tv and 7 input stereo with many sound options, a media center, DVD, VHS and CD jukebox. Today I spent 6 hours trying to program it and only got it to partially work. So it's on it's way back to Amazon. In summation: don't buy this remote. I'm staying with the excellent TVIO remote and the Sony AV remote."
1,Google: logitech 880 charging problems before you buy!!!,I have had this remote for about 4 years now and have not been able to ditch my factory remote because the Logitech 880 doesn't set in the charger right and you think you have it on and it's charging but when you want to use it it's dead. The problem is the charging contacts on the remote don't make good contact with the contacts on the charger. Logitech is well aware of this problem and offers no help with a fix! That's why I will not buy another product from them. Dont just take my word on it.... Google it and you'll see.
2,Nice - but not great,"This remote fits in my hand very well. It was easy to set up. I really like the activities - one button to turn on and source all components. Good news all those little ""seldom used"" buttons on other remotes are all programmed in. One can also reassign the locations of the individual buttons. I would rate high marks in all of these regards. Especially since I did away with 6 other separate remotes.The downside is two fold: (1) the charging cradle is a very poor design. I need to put a book on top of the remote to hold it down in the cradle. (2) The buttons on the remote are very poor. They do not hold up. About 6 months into the remote the volume buttons stopped working. Every month since, another and then another button stopped working. Even trying to only use a very light touch does not seem to prevent the button from breaking."
2,Work great for a while,"Easy to set up. Works great for a while. After a few months I had the same issue getting it to sit in the charging cradle properly as everyone else seems to have. Also after a while, some of the button stopped working. For the money, it should be built better. I would recommend looking for a different model remote. You'll be happy as first, but long term it will disappoint."
2,"Good for some, but not for me.","The construction on this was not so hot. The contacts between the charger and the unit failed to connect after a couple of weeks, making it super-difficult to charge the remote.More than that, though: this isn't a remote for use in a house with little kids. It's just too complicated to learn, especially if folks forget to use the shortcut butons.Luckily, the Tivo Series 3 obviated the need for the 880, since we didn't need to switch between SD and HD sources anymore."
5,A MUST HAVE,"this is a must have for those of you with dvr, a hdtv, dvd, reciever, vcr and everything else you may have in the house. say goodbye to the basket of remote controls sitting on the table. easy to use easy to program never gets lost, really makes tv viewing easier by making the buttons most commonly used accessible to you without changing remotes."
5,Awesome...must have,It worked with all my audio/video equipment including my Bose Lifestyle Audio system. Setting it up was a breeze. The new software makes it really simple. I was going to get the 890 instead of the 880 because I thought I needed an RF remote to work with my BOSE. It walked me through setting up my bose to work with it and now all my components interact with it perfectlt. Great job Logitech!!!!!!
1,Life Span is about one year.,"I now join DOZENS of other users (read the Forums)whose Harmony 880 cradle just stops charging the unit after a year or so. When that happens, you are basically up the creek without a paddle. Replacement batteries are not to be found, cleaning the contacts doesn't help, wedging little pieces of paper in the battery compartment to improve the contact pressure deosn't work. It was nice while it lasted...but I would NEVER buy another one and caution anyone AGAINST purchasing this unit. CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!"
4,Cool Remote!,"I like this remote. I was skeptical but it does what it's suppose to do. My wife even likes it because it's user friendly. The setup isn't that bad. A couple of questions I didn't know the answer to at first but all in all it was setup up in no time. It works and If I had to mention anything that I'm not crazy about it would be the feel of the buttons. A little small and slippery. A little awkward to handle with 1 hand. I see my wife uses two hands. Get it, you'll like it! Peace!"
4,Good Stuff!!,"This remote is really easy to program. It works great and I will never have to buy batteries again thanks to the docking cradle and rechargable batteries. The only thing that I wish was better on the remote is button placement. The mute button and previous button are the tiny sliver of a button above the volume and the channel changing buttons. The arrows surrounding the OK button are also hard to push correctly. Let me explain, when I try pressing the left arrow the up or down arrow sometimes registers and visa versa due to the button being one connected circular ring surrounding the OK button."
1,Not acurately decribed,"This is not a 3-in/3-out fused terminal block.Think of it as a GIANT 1-in and 3 out and now you are dealing with reality. Say about the size of the end of a 2 x 4.I bought 2, thinking they were about the standard AGC size. BUT, input is really 1 common lug.At the price they are offered, I bought 2, and I'm glad that I did, because I was able to cannibalize one unit to mnake a true 3-3 fused connection.Not worth going ballistic over, but even the shrink-wrap packaging described this wrong."
4,Enligtening,"I am writing on a paper on satanism in Norway(therefore badly written english). This essyes from good old Mirca, is a good phenomenological point of wiew. I think he sets things into context, but for my case it is a bit old. If you want a general introduction from the phenomenlogical school in the occult tradiction you migth as well staert with this book."
5,Comprehensive and very useful,This book is a must if you are making a trip to any North Carolina Waterfall. It gives very detailed information on how to navigate your way and how to photograph these wonderful images of nature. I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Adams at one of his signings and was able to witness his passion for the outdoors in person. Great resource for everything that is NC Waterfalls.
4,GREAT GIFT,"I gave this as a gift to my boyfriend who is a ""waterfall buff"" and hiker. The book gives info on where these falls are located and how to get to them. The book was a hit and I think anyone who is a hiker and loves waterfalls would love this guide.."
5,waterfalls,Wonderful book by the author of a companion book on Waterfalls of Virginia and West Virginia. Waterfall ratings very helpful to find just the best or see them all. Especially good for photographers.
2,I'm very disappointed,I have had many hiking books and all have been better than this. Very poorly written and poorly organized. After you waste time reading about several waterfalls the author tells you they are on private land and you cannot see them-what a waste!Skip the book and go straight to the ranger station
4,Episode Titles for Jimmy in Jeopardy,"The video comes in a box like case, copyright 1995 from Columbia House and is a Warner Home Video.I have not watched the video since I bought it for someone else but I always loved to watch the TV show when it originally aired and when our local TV stations would show marathons.The episode titles are: The Haunted Lighthouse, Semi-Private Eye (with Elisha Cook Jr.), and King for a Day."
2,Trying Too Hard,"Parts of this book are very well written, indeed! Some of the author's descriptions of the Provencal countryside make you want to be there -- right now!! On the other hand, I felt as though there was more book than we got. Ms. Huntley's focus on her emotional state of mind and her interpersonal relationships struck me as unnecessary and, forgive me, boring. I still can't figure out why she didn't just bonk the guide to begin with, concentrate on her travelogue and leave the reader out of her emotional teeth-gnashing. Her writing is at its best when telling us of her daily trips into the countryside of Provence. I must admit that Provence tends to draw out the romanticist in most of us and, in many ways, I am sympathetic to her state of mind. She should spend more than eight days there and then write more about it."
3,Take a hike,"Good book but language a little flowery. Emerging love story intimate and I felt a little creepy, like a voyeur. Did make me want to go on this trip and take in all the scenes and food/wines. Read Peter Mayle and Frances Mayes instead. (Also see Under a Tuscan Sky to get visuals tho different from the book. Yum!)"
5,a classic,"At 30 minutes, the soundtrack is too short, but it's a hugely entertaining listen. ""Hymn to Red October"" is a very rousing and nationalistic anthem. ""Nuclear Scam"" is my favorite track, however. In this track, as in other parts of the score, I love the way Basil brings together an orchestra, synths, and choir to create an awesome, bold, broad, sweeping thrill ride of music. The score is full of action, tension, and quiet moments that are thoughtful but never boring.It's definitely worth it to track down the complete version of the score. Many years after buying the OST, I acquired the ""promo"" of the complete version and I must say it is pretty awesome. Lots of great unreleased music."
2,Good fit...not much else great,"The product fits a Treo 650 perfectly, and the buttons work well through the silicon, however I have a few complaints:(1) There aren't any labels on the buttons that are covered by the silicon, so you need to memorize the functions.(2) The belt clip is white and very flimsy. I bought this case over others because it has a belt clip, and it turns out that the clip is barely usable."
2,"Nice fit, but it's a dust and lint magnet.","This is a very nice fit for the treo 650, and it looks good on the phone, but it is a big time dust magnet. Any piece of clothing that touches it will leave a lot of lint on it. I also didn't care for the flimsy white belt clip that came with it. Maybe a white or grey case instead of the black one would look best to help hide all of the lint this thing collects. I've basically stopped using it and went with one of the hard holsters instead. I found a nice leather wrapped one at CompUSA."
4,Naughty Cd,This is a classic cd from the 80's Chaka's early work I loved it then and I love it now. I am a old sckool guy so any time i can ad to my collection I will and amazon gives me that chance. and the price! the best in the business keep up the good work.Mr. Wilbert Brimm Jr.
5,I have been looking all over for this!!!,"This album was Chaka at her best!! Ashford and Simpson on the production (which was really tight) along with Hiram Bullock and other talented musicians and vocalists made this album unforgettable. And every cut was the JAM!! Clouds, All Night, Get Ready, Move Me no Mountain, Papillion, Nothing's Gonna Take You... okay, you get the picture.If you love Chaka, you already have this in your collection or you are replacing it (as in my case). If you don't have it, do yourself a favor and take a listen. I'm sure it will grace your collection soon after!"
3,Directions hard,The directions were very difficult to follow for the set up. The directions for the television remote were the most difficult
3,Not one of Linda's best,"I couldn't wait for Linda Ronstadt's newest album to come out. She can sing it all-country,folk,rock,standards,etc. but this time I was disappointed with this lackluster effort. It'd be great it she would release a compilation of all the cover songs she has done over the years (Rescue Me,Tell Him,Hurt So Bad,etc.)"
2,"LR, I'm disappointed...","This is the same woman who did Gilbert & Sullivan so well she got me interested in light opera?? This is the same woman who tried Puccini and La Boheme? And those wonderful Mexican canciones and three full albums of standards with Nelson Riddle?There is no energy on this CD at all.I've been a long-time fan of LR's and eagerly awaited this latest effort, but I'm sorry to report that most of the selections are sung as though LR is marching slowly...or even sleep-walking...through them."
2,I was extremely disappointed with this album,"We Ran was a major disappointment. I have admired Ronstadt for years and believe her to be an exceptional talent, but this latest offering was lackluster and boring. I was dismayed by the lack of creativity and choice of selections."
2,Lacks her usual energy and punch,"Linda Ronstadt sounds like she is finally tired of making records, which is too bad. This effort lacks the power and passion of her earlier works. The songs don't seem to make the best use of her voice, which is unusual for someone who has consistently chosen material to showcase her pipes. Go back and listen to her earlier works - specifically Heart Like a Wheel, Hasten Down the Wind, and Cry Like a Rainstorm - to hear what this album COULD have been."
4,"Linda is on the right track, but needs higher octane.","Ronstadt is in fine form on We Ran; her wonderful vocal nuance is a highlight. We Ran runs out of gas though, not due to her vocal quality or musical interpretation, but by being piece-meal. It is a hearty attempt and one that is headed in the right direction, but I was disappointed because it does not cause me to want to play it again and again like I do Feels Like Home or Cry Like a Rainstorm. However, Linda has some winners on this one that true fans will not want to miss: Springstein's ""If I Should Fall Behind"" and Dylan's ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues"". Her most romantic ballad is ""Dreams of San Joaquin"""
3,Going through the Motions Ronstadt,"I'm a great fan of Linda's, but was pretty disappointed in this album. My hopes were raised by the fact that she had returned to straightforward rock and roll, but I agree with other reviewers that there's a curiously lackluster feel to the album. Her heart just doesn't seem to be in it. The song selection is so-so: ""Give Me A Reason"" is embarassing, while others are just plain boring. The only one that sounds like classic Ronstadt to my ears is ""Cry 'Til My Tears Run Dry"", which is a sublime Doc Pomus song that has almost a Burt Bacharach feel here, and which Ronstadt delivers gorgeously. Wish they were all up to that level, and I also wish Linda would hook up with Peter Asher again to make more great albums! I know she's still capable of it."
2,Not as good as the first,"If you liked Adassa's previous release you may be disappointed with this one. She becomes too mainstream, or rather a bit of cliche. The grittyness in her voice is gone and you will listen to a higher pitched ""beyoncesque"" voice rather than the deeper Regaetton voice of her previous release. That being said, her voice seems to show promise if she can just chose a sound to pursue for it.Other than ""La manera"" (which you would not recognize as Adassa from just listening to it), the CD is mostly forgettable. It is not bad, just nothing to get excited about."
4,Viking 1GB CF Card in EOS-10D,Got my card here in July at a terrific price. Works great in my 10D. Took 3 months for Viking rebate but finally got that too.
1,Viking drops the ball,"I don't know if they wanted to be one of the first to put an affordable 1 GB CompactFlash card out or what. They seemed to have skimped on the quality. I just received an Olympus C-5050 and the Viking 1GB card yesterday and formatted the card in it last night. Today the card is un-readable, un-formattable and unusuable. I tried recyclying power, different batteries, etc. I just got email back from Viking tech support and all they said was to return it...I also read another review on one of these things [not working]. I'm not risking losing hundreds of pictures. I'm going with another brand."
1,Poor Quality,"I purchased the Viking 1GB CompactFlash card when I purchased the Canon 20D. I had only taken around 100 pictures when I began to get the ""Data corrupt"" error. My mistake was that I gave it several more chances. I formatted it several times and I continue to get the same error, not to mention I lost some pictures I had taken earlier which cannot be replicated. It's not worth the money nor the headache. It's better to spend an extra $30 on a better quality CompactFlash card than to have wonder whether you'll lose the pictures you just took."
4,Very fast but getting errors with minolta 7I,"I am amazed at how fast this card saves a photo. Half meg photos take about 1/8 to 1/4 second. The only problem is I keep getting an error saying the card is not accessible after the camera has been turned off and on. I guess I will get to review their product support now. This would be 5 stars if it where not for the errors I'm getting. It could still be a problem with the camera, however the 16mb card that came with the camera doesn't seem to have any problems (except being to small to be practical.)"
4,Useful 1GB Compact Flash card,"After upgrading from a 3.2 megapixel digital camera (canon S20) to the 4.0 megapixel (canon s400), it was time to eliminate the somewhat useless 16 MB, 32 MB, and 64 MB Compact Flash cards from my arsenal of digital photography gear.I have kept 128 MB, 256 MB, and 512 MB compact flash cards, but have found the Viking 1 GB compact flash to write and read quickly (in part on canon's new image processing and buffering in the S400 powershot camera).Although I debated using a multispeed USB enhanced ""digital film"" product, for the price this Viking CF card is the best value currently (12 June 2003) available given the rebate and free ground shipping at Amazon.com.I would recommend this product to other digital photographers, especially with the latest 4 and 5 megapixel cameras."
5,Great storage,"I bought the Viking 1 GB compact flash card to use in my Canon EOS 10D Digital Camera and I have not been disappointed. The Canon 10D shoots up to 3fps and the Viking flash card is fast. When both writing and on readback, the compact flash is quick and the camera never has to wait for the reading/writing. In addition, the Viking card provides a true 1GB of storage. I'm very pleased with the flash card and probably will buy a another one."
1,"Card Errors, Service disapointment","The first time I used this card, it had card errors. 1 or 2 missing pictures. I reformatted it and kept using it without additional issues, but eventually it lost all my pictures on one shoot. I contacted Viking's 24/7 technical support, but they were closed, and I sent in the card for 24 hour replacement and received a replacement four business days later.Though I am in the market for another 1 gigabyte card, and the Viking is presently the best price. I will not buy it."
2,Card died after 1 week,"I used this card for about a week. I used it to store and listen to mp3 music. After about a week the card just died on me. I could not read from it or write to it. Could not format it with either my pocket pc or a usb card reader. I had to send it back for a refund. If you get a good one I suppose this would be a great value, but I'm hesitant getting another."
1,Returned - 'Card Error' with Minolta Dimage 7Hi,"Works fine, until you get about 200 or so pix on the card (this number varies), then the camera says 'card error' after having written one or two zero-byte files. All photos were recoverable, but the card was no longer usable until re-formatted. Result - I didn't think I needed to pack another card, so was unable to continue taking pictures on a trip with the family.Also, with my Canon Powershot S110- a more devastating error, in which the entire card became inaccessible, again after about 200 pictures. Had to purchase PhotoRescue to get the pix back (told it to ignore the FAT table during recovery). This also 'fixed' the card, but the process about 4 hours to complete.This is just a bit too much of a hassle for normal use."
2,Some Merit,"This set is a bit haphazard but there are some rare live tracks within that are not found elsewhere. The Woodstock cuts (""Sparks,"" ""Pinball Wizard"" & ""See Me Feel Me / Listening to You"") are interesting but, like all the material contained here, deserve a CD to themselves. This CD seems a bit irrelevant now that the film itsef is history. Perhaps a live 2CD best of would be better. I would recommend LIVE AT LEEDS or ISLE OF WIGHT instead."
3,"Not great, but pretty damn good all the same...","My instinct was to give this a four. I've deducted one because, in its vinyl form, it was my introduction to the band back in 1979, and I don't trust my sentimentality. It's good. Not great, but still a fine work. The best tracks are the live ones (and I'm normally highly dubious about live recordings): the Tommy numbers 'Sparks', Pinball Wizard' and 'See Me Feel me' from Woodstock; the best version I've heard of 'a Quick One', and 1960s concert renditions of 'Happy Jack' and 'I Can't Explain'. The versions of 'Baba O'Riley' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again' are the last time the band played with Keith Moon, and although Moon is past his best, they're still pretty damn good. If you're into the Who, get it."
4,Some of The Who's best,"This cd may as well be a greatest hits collection for The Who. Most of their popular songs are on here. However, most of the songss are from studio recordings, failing to capture the thing that made The Who so great: The energy and emotion of their live performances."
4,A Good Modern Recording,"This is the first decent modern recording of a Furtwangler symphony and easily outclasses the competition from everyone but Furtwangler himself. But this is not to say it the definitive modern recording; there's room for improvement, especially in orchestral playing, and the last movement lags a bit. Furtwangler's own recording (with the Vienna Philharmonic on Orfeo, not the DGG studio recording) is, in my opinion, preferable except for sound quality (which is quite servicable). But this dark, moody, deeply felt, if not quite inspired, symphony deserves more performances and more recordings. If you like this, try Furtwangler's recording of the 3rd symphony (also on Orfeo), but avoid the dreadful 1st."
4,good,"every thing as expected. However, since you can't try on apparel over the net the crown of the hat was a little smaller than I expected. But thats the nature of net.---construction and quality is excellent."
2,No support and little movement,"i just bought the link a doo swong, since my sons swing broke last night, I thought it would be a very sturdy swing. That it was, but the speed was slow and my son could not sit up in it.I also was scared that he would fall through the sides. I took it bacjk right away and bought another swing.It scared me to think that FP didn't think of childrens safety first.The toys were great for my son to look at, but if he was able to grab them he could have flipped forward."
1,unsafe swing,"We bought this swing for my daughter to use at her grandparents house. She is 4 months old, and she was swinging in it and we looked over at her, and her head was caught between the two side bars on the swing. Poor baby! We contacted fisher price who will be checking the swing over. We have the aquirum swing and have never had this problem."
5,Pleased,"We received this swing as a hand-me-down, and our baby loves it! She is 2 months old and is entertained very well in it, and falls asleep better in it than just laying on a blanket. It is a lot more cost-effective than a full-sized swing, and still makes her happy. The only downside for me is that it is battery-powered, and that can get expensive especially if your baby is in it a lot. We are looking at buying Graco's full-size swing that can be plugged into an outlet."
2,Disappointed Mother,"I purchased this swing for my third child, who is 1 month old. I liked the design and toys of the swing. The different speeds and music is what made me decide to buy this swing. It was very easy to put together and to fold up. The bad thing about this swing is that there is no back or head support. My baby's head goes to side and seems to be uncomfortable. I'm actually going to return it for a full size swing."
4,"Very nice swing, but...","I bought this swing for my son since we were traveling a bit and visiting family and friends. The size is great, and it travels well. My son really enjoys the linkadoos toys and it entertains him nicely. The only problem I have with this swing is the back support on the seat. As others have mentioned it's not really a supportive seat - for head or back. Although he hasn't fussed or ""complained"" he just doesn't look comfortable in the seat. His body sags into the seat. But I really liked the swing and the option of adding toys to it so I tough of a quick fix. We just put a piece of very thin board (like a really strong/stiff cardboard) in the back of the seat under the cushion. Now his back is straight and we just put one of those head support cushions in it for him. I really like the feature of adding the linkadoos toys and all in all it is a very nice swing for the price. I'm glad we bought it."
2,"Attractive travel swing, but quickly outgrown....","My sister received this swing as a shower gift. Her 5 week old daughter LOVES it. My sister likes it because it doesn't take up much room in the car and is easy to pack, plus she likes the Garden pattern. While I was visiting her the other day, I put my 4 month old son in it. Boy, am I glad that I didn't run out the next day to purchase one. My son weighs 14 lbs and is 23 inches long. He is almost too big for the swing. His feet just about dangled and it leaned so far back that his head was only a couple inches from touching the floor. The legs of the swing needs to be longer. I think a child would outgrow it after 3 months, so you wouldn't get much use of it."
5,very happy,"I have really loved this swing - my daughter is 3 months old - I have been able to take it with me easily, as it folds up nicely & isn't too heavy. Our swings motor has been fine, I actually don't even put it on the fast speed, as it is really fast. I have no complaints about this product & highly recommend it."
1,Wish I spent my money on something else,"This swing was just a waste of money. The seat is very uncomfortable - it's shaped odd, and it's too soft and doesn't provide enough support. The baby never wants to spend more than a couple of minutes in it. The swinging speed of the lowest setting is way too fast, and the seat doesn't lock in place in case you want to use it as a seat, not as a swing. The toy rings are on the sides of the swing, so it's hard for the baby to play with them. We also have a regular-sized swing and a bouncing seat, and we DO use them a lot."
3,No Support,"I just bought this swing today and have to say that I agree with many of the other reviewers, this swing provides ""NO SUPPORT"". My 1 month old sags in the swing and I have added his head supporter. I bought this swing primarily so we could take it to grandmas when we visit. I also like Link-A-Doos and and the mirror so I thought it would be a great toy as well. However, he does not like the swing and cries non stop when we put him in. I will give it a week to see if he gets more accustomed to it. If not, I will definitely go for the full size swing."
2,Use with CAUTION!,"We bought this swing for our 3-month old son so we could easily transport it to grandma's house. While it is convenient, it is NOT SAFE at all!!! My son enjoys playing with the linkadoos toys but when he tugs on them, he tips over to the sides of the seat and hangs between the leg bars. I was horrified to see that the seatbelt did not help. In order for a child to remain safely upright, the seat would require shoulder straps (just like the ones found in carseats). Also, the seat is not sturdy and causes him to slouch. I had to put burp clothes under his back to straighten out his posture. I recommend this product only for younger babies as they are not able to grasp the hanging toys and fall over."
1,POTENTIAL DANGER/GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE,"We purchased the safari print - but it's the same frame - so I'd like to share my review:We purchased this swing for use at Grandma's house about 2 months ago (when my child was 2 months old). Now that she is 4 months (25 in, 16 lbs) we've discovered that she can move her legs around enough to potentially get caught in between the front base legs and the actual swing arm. Thankfully, my mother was on the floor making faces at the baby and was able to stop the swing before my child did actually get her leg caught. I called Fisher Price this morning. Their customer service was absolutely amazing. We enjoy a lot of their other products, but thought it was important for other parents to know of this potential danger."
2,Does not swing my 6 month old anymore,We bought this swing to soothe our daughter when she got her first ear infection at 5 months. We wish we had kept the box and the receipt b/c she doesn't much care for it. There's not a lot of support and it's barely strong enough to swing her and she's only 17lbs. She now sticks her leg out to stop the swing while it's in motion which is very dangerous. I wouldn't recommend this swing. It's sitting in her nursery collecting dust.
2,Don't care for this and neither does my son,"My son screamed whenever we put him in the swing from birth to 2-3 months. Now at 4 months, he will tolerate it, but only for short periods of time. Some friends lent us their full size Graco swing and he loves that one!My biggest complaint is that the seat isn't supportive and too reclined. My son is much happier in the molded plastic seat with padding so he can sit up straight and see what's going on. Also, the mechanism that makes it swing gets knocked off easily when the swing is moved from place to place and it will just stop swinging.We're all much happier with the full size swing."
1,Linkadoos Take Along Swing,"We take our 4 month old daughter to work with us, and thought that this swing would be an asset...then we got it home...we noticed while my husband was putting it together that it didn't seem very stable. After we put our daughter in it, she seemed to like the idea of the toys, but was not comfortable with the motion, which seemed more like a rocker that a swing...and did not want to be in the swing for any length of time...we ended up taking it back, and purchased a Graco, Hide a Way swing...it has offered us the convienice of being portable, for work, and seems like a much better fit for our daughter."
3,Serves its purpose,"Our 7 week old son loves his big swing, so we bought the Link-a-Doos travel swing for trips. I experienced the same problem with the seat as stated in other reviews--Our son's whole body seemed to slowly slouch over. However, we discovered that if you tilt the seat prior to putting your child in it (to where it sort of cradles them), then the slouching problem is solved. At only 7 weeks, our son can still enjoy this swing despite the lack of support in the seat. One other issue we seem to have though is the arm with the toys. It does not stay positioned very well and tends to swing into my son's face. We tend not to use it--which is okay for my son b/c he simply likes to swing--But for those of you looking to entertain your children with this, you may want to check out the store model before purchasing."
1,never again,"I would never buy this swing, it is unsafe. My daughters head falls through the sides and it gets stuck while the swing continues to try to swing. Her head jams in between the sides and the legs.Then when she is in it, it hardly moves. Very weak in swinging and the mobile sits right in front of her face. Unsatisfied!"
4,Great for on the go,So far so good. My son is three months and he loves his home swing so muich we got one to take along with us. So far he loves it. I do think the speed is slow though but for the price it's a good deal.
2,Not for Newborns!,"I bought this swing for the purpose of moving it from room to room in my house. But only ended up using it in one room. It definitely did not have the necessary back and neck support for newborns, even though the box says from birth and up. I even put a carseat head support on the seat, but that didn't work, and ended up propping my son's head up with burp cloths. A couple of times, he slumped over so badly he almost fell out of the seat! That's when I had enough and returned the swing to the store. I just bought the larger Link a Doos swing, hopefully that will work out better for him.The travel swing is definitely cute and probably a good idea for traveling, we even got used to the songs. But the box should state that it is for 3+ months."
1,Hazardious item,"Please do not buy this product if your child is able to move. I found my son's head stock in between the two legs of the swing. My son is 19 pounds and he is able to lift him self up a bit, and since there is no shoulder strap on this swing, his head felt side ways and was trapped in between the legs and the swing had kept on going. When I called fisher price, they just didnt seem to care."
5,SON AND DAUGTHER INLAW LOVE IT.,"WHEN MY DAUGTHER INLAW AND SON ASKED FOR THIS FOR THE BABY I WENT RIGHT ONLINE TO AMAZON AND KNEW I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THIS WITH OUT ANY TRAVLING, I WAS RIGHT, THE KIDS LOVE IT AND SO DOES THE BABY, THEY BRING IT TO MY HOUSE WITH THE BABY AND SHE LOVES TO SWING. THANK YOU AMAZON"
1,PLEASE BE CAREFUL - CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS!!!,"When I first purchased this swing for my second baby, I loved it. However, when he was first able to start grabbing the side bars and pull himself up I noticed that it looked as if his whole body might fall forward because of the design of the seat and the lack of shoulder straps. Since then he has actually fallen to the side twice - once facing down and once facing up - with his head hanging over the side and under the bars. I have never left him unattended in this swing so it wasn't a life-threatening problem because I was able to get him out immediately. We will never use this swing again. IT IS TOO DANGEROUS! I will be writing to Fisher Price to inform them of the potential danger this swing has. There needs to be some sort of side protection on the seat, or a shoulder strap. PLEASE THINK LONG AND HARD BEFORE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT FOR YOUR PRICELESS BUNDLE OF JOY."
4,Just Okay,"My baby is almost 3 months old now, and we bought this swing when she was about 3 weeks old. I like that it's small and doesn't take up much room in our small apartment.But my baby has never been that impressed with it. She doesn't seem interested in the toys or the music, so when we put her in it awake, she will usually cry to get back out within 10 minutes. She has recently started checking herself out in the mirror, though, so maybe she'll learn to like it still.However, I still love it for napping. She sleeps in it quite comfortably for her morning nap every day."
2,Wish I hadn't bought it,"If you read my other reviews, you will see that I love all the other Fisher Price (mostly Ocean Wonders) products that I have bought. I needed a travel swing to have at my parents' house, and decided on this one because of price, and because I have too many Ocean Wonders items. Well, I wish I had gotten the Ocean Wonders travel swing. The Linkadoos swing has my son practically laying down with his feet in the air while in it, and I must say it was put together by someone with a physics PhD, so we know it was done right. He outgrew this so fast because after a while his weight (at 20 lbs) wouldn't allow the swing to ever get going. He would also start sticking his feet out and making the swing stop. The upside of this swing was the actual linkadoos toys. He really enjoyed playing with them, and they were easy to attach to other things: a stroller, shopping cart, carrier, etc. Please thoroughly consider your other possibilities before buying this swing."
3,Not very safe,The strap on this swing is very unsafe. it really needs a 5 point harness. My daughter will slump over. She even slumped over to the side and got her head caught between the bars when she was about 3 months old. Great swing but needs a different strap.
1,Unsafe and uncomfortable,"I researched all of the other equipment that I asked for on my registry except for this product, I thought it was cute. I absolutely hate it. My son is now 4 months old, and sits up pretty well, but I still have to put a towel roll behind his shoulders because the swing is so unsupportive, it actually causes him to slump over. The speeds are either very slow or too fast. I used to put a neck support around him while he was in the swing, when he was 1 month old, but then I saw him lean forward and fall over to the side, with his head between the bars, even though he was securely fastened in. You can't walk out of the room and trust that your child will be safe. I recommend a swing with a more supportive back."
1,opposite problem,"The other reviews have the opposite problem that I have with this swing. When I put my baby in it, he lays waaaay too far back, his little feet are far above his head. He hates it! It doesn't make a far enough arc to keep him happy, where a full size swing does. Be very careful with purchasing this product, it's a great concept with too many bugs. This was the third return on the same swing for us. Not worth the money!"
3,"Good to play in, but not to sleep.","I liked this swing for my 2 month old to play with, but he wanted to sleep in it. I did not find that he could sleep in it cause it does not recline back enough. He kept slumping from one side to the other. If your child likes to sleep in a swing, like my son with colic does, I would NOT recomend this."
4,Like it - don't love it,I wanted a swing with a hood - and for some reason it has started squeaking after only a few months - but I do like the small size and that it is low to the ground. I took all of the toys off.
1,Please dont buy this item!,"I bought this swing because my 3 month old son is in love with the Ocean Aquarium Cradle Swing, which he sleeps in for 4-6 hours at a time. So, I thought I should get a portable swing to take along with me to grandmas house. Well, as soon as I put him in there, the seat tipped all the way back and he nearly slid out head first. The belt is too loose and the speed of the swing drove him nuts. It was shaking him, not swinging him. The music is obnoxious and stringy, not soothing. I havent had any problems with any other products except this one. I was hesitating to rate this, but it was that bad. Im going to exchange it for the Aquarium take along swing and see if it is as wonderful as the larger cradle swing."
2,Not what I had hoped,"I registered for this item and have tried it several times with my 4 month old daughter. She does like it for a while, but I think the music is too loud, the lowest swing setting is actually pretty fast if you have a lightweight baby, and the back is not inclinded quite right. She always looks so uncomfortable. The best thing I like is the harness. It is much better than the Linkadoos Bouncer, it comes up much higher and is not as tight around her middle."
2,Cute but not comfy,I recieved this as a gift and my daughter has never been very fond of the swing. The seat doesn't recline back enough for her to be comfortable. She just slumps from side to side and has never slept in it. She had like other swings alot but not this one. I would not recommend this swing.
3,Not for newborns!!,"We received this swing off of our baby registry. This swing is definately not for newborns. There is no support for a newborn, and my daughter ends up slumped over with her head at a terrible angle. I'm sure once she's a little bigger the swing will be fine. I agree with another reviewer about the speed issue....you have to get the swing started, but once you do, it holds that speed and the controls will make it faster or slower. The music is pretty much the same nursery rhyme mix that you hear in every single baby toy. Another thing i'm not thrilled about is that on the demo of the toy online, it says that the mirrior/sun on top and the toys it comes with can also be linked as a mobile. It really doesn't and looks silly if you try to setup like that."
5,swings,"I love this product!! It's very easy to pack up and ""Take Along"". It doesn't take up too much room in our house. My son is a little colicky and this works most of the time. The fabric is easy to clean and really cute."
3,Not a great swing,"This swing isn't very powerful. Even on the highest setting, the performance is poor compared to a full size swing. Also, the flowery toy connected to the swing is a pain and gets in the way. The worst thing about this swing is the lack of back support. My baby looks like she is being folded in half, which can't be good for posture. She always looks slumped and uncomfortable.However, the swing is really cute and the rings on the sides make it easy to link on toys. My daughter does likes the music it plays. Also, the way it folds up is nice and does not take up too much space. We do use the swing from time to time, but I wish I had made a different choice."
1,what a mistake,"i ask for this product in my registry and got it. what a mistake, my 5 mo. old barely used it.. she looked & was so uncomfortable in it. i should have considered the reviews. her head would tilt too forward and downward..which is not a safe thing for infants. now its just there collecting dust."
1,Do Not Purchase,"I thought this swing was going to be great, it wasn't. First of all there is no back support and my baby's head would flop to the one side and she would have difficulties trying to look around. I was able to fix it by placing a burp cloth behind my daughter's shoulders. The other issue is that the motor isn't strong enough to swing my 13lb baby very much. If she kicks or moves it disrupts the motor and it stops swinging. Lastly and most importantly is that I was on the phone in the next room and I heard my daughter screaming, I came running in and found that she had slipped out of the swing and was hanging upside down between the support legs! I was FURRIOUS. Do yourself a favor and skip this and buy the Oceanwonders bouncy seat."
4,Great swing,"I love this swing! My daughter is now 5 months old and still loves it. She uses it almost every day. She likes the music and loves being able to see herself in the mirror. I like that I can easily move her from room to room while cleaning. Sometimes it is hard to get it started. I usually have to give it a small push (before she goes in it) and it is fine. Other than that, we love it."
2,didnt work for me,"Ive heard many good things about this swing along with the Aquarium Take Along Swing With Handle as well.I got this swing because it does not have the bar across the top like the Aquarium Take Along Swing With Handle. It may have worked for many of you. But my 6 week old son hates being in that swing. There is no support for his head either, he keeps on flopping over to one side. Also the way the seat on this swing is made is more for babies who are sitting up right.so I am returning this swing in exchange for a bouncer and may think of getting a swing later on."
1,Not good,"I bought this swing for my 4 month old daughter. It looked good. but then when i put her in it for the second time, she grabbed hold of the adjoining roda and pulled herself up. If my husband wouldnt have been standing right next to her, would have fallen of it.I would advise against buying this"
1,NOT sturdy at all,"I have the Aquarium Take Along Swing and I received the Linkadoos too as a shower gift. I thought I would keep one in the car as we traveled to houses for convenience. Once I put the Linkadoos swing together, I thought it was poorly designed, especially compared to the Aquarium one. It seems like it will just fall apart. I am still attempting to put it back in the box and take it back. My recommendation, is to spend a little more and get the Aquarium model."
1,Dangerous to baby/Returned mine/Babies almost injured,"We purchased 2 of these in January 2005 for our newborn twins. We had problems immediately- eventually we returned ours to Fisher Price and got a full refund. Their customer service was helpful.So what's the safety problem? The strap is inadequate to keep babies from tipping over to the side. Several times we found our girls tipped over, virtually laying across the street, with their heads hanging ov the side between the bars. I can so easily see a newborn, slumped too far forward who's breathing access could be cut off.I made the appropriate reports- please- while there's alot about these swings that look cute and the size is nice- it needs some tweaking to be SAFE and safety is what counts."
1,do not get!!!,This swing is good only because it is portable. My daughter has had her head fall out the side of the swing twice. Her head gets stuck between the bars. I do not think the side of the seats are high enough. I think these shoud be taken off the market till the seats are fixed.!!!!!
2,Good idea but some bad design flaws,"I agree that this swing just doesn't have the necessary back support. By the time my son will be strong enough to sit comfortably in it, the motor probably won't be strong enough to swing him. It is lightweight and it does fold up nicely, but I can't believe that Fisher Price would neglect something as important as infant support. Bummer."
1,Dangerous - do not buy.,"I've never written a review before, but felt I had to with this product. I bought this swing when my baby was just born - right away his little head would fall out over the side of the swing when it was in motion. I bought a car seat insert to combat this, but even that was not a great solution - as there was nowhere to secure the insert to the swing. I put the swing away until my son was a little older and could control his own head. Even now at 6 mos old, his head will fall out over the side when the swing is in motion and he does not have the strength to pull himself back into an upright position. I honestly feel that there should be a safety recall on this item and swings like it where there is not much support for the childs head. My other two children had a swing with a bucket style seat and they could swing in that safely. I wish I still had that old thing!"
5,Great travel swing,"My son loves this travel swing. It's easy to fold and take along in the car. I take it to my mothers house and my mother-in-laws house whenever they are going to babysit my son. It's easy to use, and the music and automatic swinging action work great. It works so well, that my nieces (7 & 9) both wished they could sit in it and swing away. I love link-a-doos stuff because all the toys are interchangeable and this eliminates the boredom factor. I also always keep the travel swing in my minivan, just so I'm sure to have it wherever I go."
1,Returned this swing to Babies R Us,"I was very unhappy with this swing. It has no head support. My baby hated it. It is not cozy at all. The seat does not recline. I had to put blankets around her when she was in it to make it comfortable, and even that didn't help. I went ahead and returned it and purchased a cradle swing."
4,It can work for you!,"I use a headrest for my daughter when she was 2 months, i still use it and she is now growing out of it. By then her neck will be strong enough that her head will not roll off or something like that. the best feature of this product is how portable it is, you can move it around the house.I'm happy with the speed and with the toys"
3,Great Idea...needs more work.,"This swing is great for infants. It has speed adjustments to make it slow enough for the youngest babies. It was good until my baby reached 15lbs. It now uses batteries faster than I can replace them and forget about the cute music option if you want it to swing because the music slows the motion. It's nice to bring the Grandma's, but it may be better to buy a full size one for 2 houses than to compromise functionality.Linkadoos are a great idea overall, but need some work. The links on this toy as well as on other Linkadoo items slowly stretch out and the opening in the link is too large for it to stay linked on the other rings.If you don't mind changing (and buying) batteries this may be a good choice, if not go for the larger swings.If you want your 6 month old to be able to swing...don't even think about this one. It only works while they are little babies."
4,great travel swing!,"My husband and I bought this swing for traveling. Our 3 month old loves it, it has non stop music and he loves the linkadoos attached. The toys come off so we can put them on his car seat or use tham as rattles. It does have the baby sitting at an awkward position, but he still enjoys his swing awake and asleep."
2,"slow motor, no support","I thought that this would be a good swing to take on our trips or to grandma's house, but I was wrong. The seat does not offer my daughter any support for her back or neck, which makes it seem like she can't breathe. The motor is also VERY SLOW, even on the highest speed. My daughter is only 2 months old, and the average size so in my opinion the swing should go a little faster. The good thing about about the swing is that the toys are interchangable, and the fabric is somewhat intertaining. I think that one should really spend the money on a full size swing."
2,stiff neck,"We bought this swing on our trip because my daughter is Miss High Maintenance and requires a swing for her naps. This one looked good and we figured that we would ship it back at the end of the trip. We ended up returning it instead. The switch for the swing needed to be switched up and down a few times to get the motor to start (must have been a bad connection somewhere) The poor baby also woke up crying because her head was stuck in a most uncomfortable looking position. We like the idea of a portable swing for trips, but we will look for another on our next one."
3,"Overall, good, but.....","I registered for two of these swings for my twins. Like other reviewers have experienced, I left the room while one of my babies was asleep in the swing, and heard her crying. Upon my return, I was shocked to find her head hanging off the side and almost striking the legs of the swing! I have only had one of these experiences, and I now make sure that the baby is snugly strapped in every time, and I don't wander too far off. The other problem is one of the swings seems to have a problem with the motor, as it will swing for a while, then get out of sequence and stop altogether. Have had them for six months. They do fold up well for travel to grandma's, or to get them out of the way in the house. Also, they are very quiet. So, they work, but I don't know if I'd recommend them to someone else because of the safety issue, plus the kids' heads do tend to fall forward excessively when they're younger."
2,Not for my child.,My daughter does not enjoy this swing. I thought maybe she just didn't care for the motion but we used a friend's swing and she liked that one so it has to be something to do with this one. The lowest speed seems pretty fast to me and there doesn't seem to be much variation in the different speed settings.I am not a fan of this one.
2,Not for our little one,"Our daughter, now 7 weeks old, has yet to warm up to this swing. There isn't anything fundamentally wrong with the swing; it is what it is. Our daughter just doesn't like it. The motor isn't particularly powerful, the music isn't very soothing, and I don't think she feels secure being so close to the floor."
1,LinkaDoos Swing,"The item was delivered damaged and was sent back to UPS salvage, I have yet to receive any type of reembursement. I have contacted Amazon via the web several times with no answers."
3,I'm Not in the Army,"I bought these as a good utilitarian option to my normal boxers. I purchased the size I normally wear. They were too small by two inches. I contacted the vendor and was told that underwear was not returnable. A further exchange revealed that this policy extended to product that had not been opened. They're perfectly good in terms of quality, just be aware that the size you buy routinely and these are at variance. I thought about ordering the larger size but was sufficiently annoyed at their policy to resist. Somewhere their ""non-return"" should have been clearly noted. This isn't to say it wasn't, but in checking, I cannot find it."
2,sizing not right,I think the quality of this product is nice. But the sizing is way off. I normally buy a medium even though I could technically wear a small. I did order medium boxer and I can just barely get into them. Order a size larger than you normally would.
4,Biography of Admiral Strauss' Profesional Life,"This biography of Admiral Lewis L. Strauss recalls the professional life of the man who ""dominated U.S. atomic policy more than any other man in the formative years of the Atomic age, 1946-58"" (preface). In his depiction of this apolitical figure, the author focuses on his hard-nosed professional life, therefore excluding his familial and personal relationships. The book tells of his rejection by the senate, the effects of atom bombs on the Japanese, his decision to excommunicate Robert Oppenheimer from decision making, his part in nuclear weapons testing, and his relationship with president Eisenhower. During the course of the work, the author makes it clear that Strauss labored diligently to save the world from nuclear catastrophe; he even opposed the atomic attack on Nagasaki."
5,Suprisingly spectacular,"A great surprise from 2008 that I certainly didn't see coming. Jean-Claudde gives one of the best performances of the year in a heart-felt drama, not the action film you'd expect. This is the type of movie that I'll be taking out the DVD to show friends and family and blow them away."
5,heart-felt Van Damme,"Rivetting movie, heart-felt story and happy to have bought it. I hope to see Van Damme do more of these types of movies and he deserves to receive great praises!"
2,Not so great,While there were moments of very good acting this was not a typical JCVD movie buy a long shot. That is to say that there was hardly any action. Someone refered to it as an art house film and if subtitles and art house films is your thing then it is probably a very good movie for you. But if you are looking for a good action movie this is not it.
4,Shockingly good!,"If you had told me that I would ever appreciate a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie this much, I would have laughed in your face. But this funny and quixotic little farce is really one of the best movies of the year, sure to make my top 10! Our hero basically plays himself, who gets caught up in a post office robbery where the police think he is the perpetrator. Utterly hilarious and surreal - especially where JCVD ascends to the ""heavens"" for a 10-minute soliloquy, where he even cries on cue! Who knew that his guy ever had it in him?? Not me!"
5,Heartfelt performance by Van Damme,JCVD is a suspense drama. Jean-Claude gives a highly emotional performance with very little martial arts!This is a five star product-Some of his upcoming products include:2009 The Eagle Path2009 Universal Soldiers: The Next Generation2010 The Pit Bull
1,rememeber those who love this movie are those who hate his others,"If you really want to see Jean-Claude Van Damme whine for an hour and a half about how much it sucks to be him, then this is your movie. Because that is about all that there is to this movie. It starts off reasonably well with a humorous mock filming of a low budget action movie scene. Then we get what looks like a possibly funny quirky crime comedy as Van Damme is mistaken for robbing a bank in his hometown in the country of Brussells. But then he gets all whinny, and never stops until the movie dose. At least I did learn a new term, everytime a celebrity complains about how bad it is to be them and how unfair fame is, I'm gonna say that they caught a bad case of JCVD."
5,JCVD,very deep and self exploring movie for Jean Claude. Had he been this humble years before his career wouldn't probably be in the crapper.
4,Fantastic film,"What a great movie, and really defies all of your expectations. My only complaints are that I didn't need quite so much re-hashing of the story at the beginning of the second and third ""acts"", and that by the end of this movie i just felt sorry for Jean-Claude--and I don't think that this is the intended emotional response. but who knows, maybe it is? I think this is a movie that tries to illustrate the existential problems posed by being a celebrity--the movie itself and the main star being both real and yet fictional at the same time.anyways, this is a great film, not like anything i've seen before. give it a chance, you won't be sorry. Unless you don't like reading subtitles--most of the movie is in French."
5,A Surprisingly Great Movie!,"This movie has it all. There's action, comedy, wit and wisdom. If you know Jean-Claude's history you will get a lot of who the characters are in the movie. However, if you don't know his history you will still love the movie. You must check this one out. Ciao."
4,solid drama with sporadic action,"There are a few 1 star reviews lurking about for this film. Please be aware that the vast majority of them revolve around the fact that JCVD is 'not in English'. That is to say that the people delivering those reviews A: Can't read fast enough to deal with subtitles, B: Can't read at all or they'd know it was a foreign film before they started watching and C: Don't know what language this film is actually in (it's french) and thusly use the phrase 'not in English' to describe it.I give JCVD 4/5 on Amazon because it's certainly worth the rental to see Van Damme bust out some actual acting chops. The direction was solid, the dialogue was well written in both languages (yes, it has some english in it) and the film was entertaining. My IMDB score put it at a 7/10 which is .2 below it's current average on that site.Bottom line, don't come looking for Bloodsport and you won't be disappointed. This is a self deprecating comedic drama and it's an above average one at that."
1,JCVD,"Was not the movie that you would expect however he should have an oscar for this one, my friend that i got the movie for would rather see balls to the walls JCVD"
2,No idea what was going on there.,"That movie just didn't make any sense.I'm guessing if you're a 'JCVD' fan, it might make sense. But yeah, I was just clueless."
4,A good window into JCVD,"Even though this is not a documentary, you feel like you get to know a bit of the real person behind the actor. Very entertaining and made me feel very sympathetic toward an actor who is a man who has gone through a lot."
5,Incredible!,"I'm a WWII airplanes enthsiast, and this book has filled all my expectations. The text, the scaled drawings, the fold-out panels, everithing is exceptional in this complete guide of WWII airplanes. The drawings of this book are incredibly detailed, and if you're meticulous, you'll never find a book like this. My grandfather was a WWII pilot and became nostalgic when he saw the plane he had flown."
4,Good for beginning tagalog speakers,"Good , easy book for beginning tagalog speakers and readers.it helped me a lot.."
1,"too small, not enough words","There are so many mistakes in the grammar section and not enough words. I bought this for my friend who was going to the Philippines but had I known how incomplete it was, I would have just given him a real dictionary instead."
4,"Very good quick reference, but don't expect depth","This little book has enough phrases to enable an absolute beginner to get around. There is a truly basics-only grammar section and many categories of phrases that are really quite useful, and it is very compact, so it is easy to carry around, and thus likely to actually be used.However, its conciseness is also its greatest limitation. The ""dictionaries"" (glossaries) are much too small to be of practical use. The ""basic grammar"" sections, likewise, are so abbreviated that they leave more questions than they answer. Nevertheless, you can get the gist of how the language is constructed.This is definitely NOT a Tagalog textbook; to try to use it as such would be very frustrating. But it is a fine on-the-street, quick reference for the novice traveler, restaurant goer, shopper, or lover, etc.; just enough for the quick, basic phrases needed to get along, but not so much as to overwhelm or weigh you down."
5,First Rate Novel Set in Thailand,Spiritland is one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. I couldn't put it down. It's the story of an American woman who ditches her life in America and goes traveling in Thailand. Maddy's dangerous and riveting adventure is beautifully described in a way that makes you feel the humidity and wonder what could possibly happen next. I highly recommend this captivating novel!
3,An engineer's bedtime reading,"""Virtual LM"" provides a detailed pictorial explanation of the Apollo Lunar Module and its ""baggage"" - the ALSEP packages and Lunar Rover. Carefully drawn color-coded diagrams explain the structure and systems of the Lunar Module, showing detail from several different angles. If you have an engineering bent, and love (or need) to know how things work, this is the book for you. If you want an overview of the Lunar Module - this book gives you more detail than you will ever need to know."
1,Spend your money on a professional swing analysis instead,"I've been using this product for about a month. It claims to measure swing speed, distance and direction. It does not do so within any reasonable limits. The instructions claims it is designed to be at least 80% accurate about 80% of the time. Its no where near that from what I've seen. For instance, it indicates that my average 3 iron shot goes about 140 yards with a swing speed in the 60s. My true swing speed in in the mid to upper 80s and my 3-iron easliy goes 200 yards. Trust me, I'm using this thing correctly, it's just not accurate. I think it is, however, accurate in the direction indicator, but that's hardly worth $150. Spend your money on a swing analysis at your local pro shop instead."
2,100% Australian maybe...,"For starters, the first ingredient listed on the side of the jar is Petrolatum, followed by Select Australian Beeswax, and finally Fragrance... so this product is 100% pure Australian... and it also contains wax. Getting over that nonsense, it is a smooth wax with a nice smell. I used this product as a supplement for my mustache wax and found it lacking. It was too soft, lost its hold almost immediately, and seemed to rub off onto my face almost immediately. Gross."
3,Scent is too strong for me,This product seems to be as described but the scent is just too strong for me. Also just doesn't do the job I need on my mustache. I would use it as lip balm but can't stand the smell.
5,Forget chap stick,"I originally bought this item to preserve over 70 year old knife handles (leather), then found out it makes an amazing lip balm. It is absolutely amazing on dry hands and dry lips. Instead of buying giant packs of chap stick one jar of this can literally last 4-5 months with constant use. For such a simple product is has so many uses."
4,Buyer Beware!,"Amazon Marketplace Booksellers are abusing their privilege to sell this good book, charging ridiculous auction prices. The book sells from the US Holocaust Memorial Museum for $15.95, brand new!! [....] This is an excellent book, but should not cost you more than $20."
5,New information,"Having been to Romania several times and traveled the country, I have a much better understanding of its history, after reading this work."
1,hack job,"As an insurance sales professional, I looked forward to reading this book. I am always looking for new ideas to help me sell more. Unfortunately, this book breaks no new ground.Salespeople in many fields are sometimes look down upon. Those that follow the advice in this book are likely to receive the same treatment. It essentially proposes a mechanical, technique filled approach to manipulate the customer. These techniques may be fine for print media and cheap products, but they fail miserably in the world of professional sales."
1,A walk down memory lane!,"What a Snoozer! If anyone looking to improve their own sales practice depends upon this book you'll starve. Although some of the advice offered here, in fairness to Sugarman, may be applied, this disappointing tome was NOT AT ALL what the ads and reviews made it out to be. If the author wrote the ad-copy, I guess in one respect he was successful......he got me to buy the book. Look me up on e-bay next week."
3,"""Advertising Secrets Of Written Word"" is much more powerful","I purchased both ""Advertising Secrets of The Written Word"" and ""Triggers"" at the same time. Unfortunately I read ""Advertising Secrets"" first and was very satisfied with it.Once I started reading ""Triggers"" it was like reading it all over again, word for word. Sugarman has taken entire chapters from the first book and inserted them into ""Triggers"".""Advertising Secrets of the Written Word"" covers all of these triggers and a whole lot more, therefore it is a much better book. I love Joe Sugarman's work and enjoy reading his books, but I believe you'll be much more satisfied with the first one.Hope this helps!"
4,Triggers,"I have read Mr. Sugarman's book and found it to be both helpful and insightful. Once I started reading it, I found it hard to put down. My company operates in the high tech arena and after reading ""Scotts (no E-mail)"" comments I couldn't disagree more. Mr. Sugarman, one of the nation's most respected authors in sales and advertising, offers no trickery but powerful techniques. My company has effectively used Mr. Sugarman's teachings from his other books, and speaking for myself I think this one is the best."
5,Triggers never fail!,This is another amazing book by Joe Sugarman. Ihave followed him for a while and this is one ofmy most favorite books by him. I use it to getsome good ideas when I write emails to send tomy list. I highly recommend this one.Matt BacakAuthor of Secrets of the Internet Millionaire Mindand The Ultimate Lead Generation Plan
2,Marketers are not sales people,"Although Mr. Sugarman can be funny at times in his writing his blatant self marketing overshadows the humor. Also as a sales person who has done a lot of marketing, I can say that marketers are not sales people. In fact this book encourages the mistakes made by many young companies of buying into a marketer's hype and believing that they can increase sales. This is only true on simple products like sunglasses. If you sell high tech or solutions pass on this book. It is all about how to trick the customer which is not how deals are closed."
4,a great book for the beginning salesperson,"While someone with lots of selling experience would find this pretty old stuff, someone just starting out in sales or still learning, would find this a very good addition to his or her sales library.Triggers touches most all of the basic selling triggers and does so in a fairly modern way that would appeal to younger people. It is, however, taken from the old standbys that we learned over thirty years ago and were probably available before that.But then, nothing is really new is it?If you're new to sales or still learning, this is an excellent little book to read. If you're a pro already, you should look elsewhere.Susanna K. HutchesonExecutive Copy Director & OwnerPowerwriting.com LLC"
4,Not lynch's,This album was not directly from the RIPP GUTT himself. I think he put alot of work in C.O.S's and Cans hands. But I bought it cuzz it was a lynch album. I like #4
2,Not the Lynch I know,"I'm a hardcore Lynch fan and find this album a big dissapointment. I like his older season of da sicc style nott this new stuff. In one song they're talking about louie vitton, thats not the lynch i know"
4,Does what it say's,"Holds my Sig 2022 close to the body somewhat easier to conceal than my Blackhawk paddle holster. Still prefer the paddle holster over this but, it's a good holster none the less."
1,Buyer Beware... Stay Away,"This Game worked one time, that's it.. It started giving me a error code, so I tried to downloaded it again, but it will not download. Fun game, but this software is flawed. I didn't return because the item is so cheap and not worth my time to return."
4,Rise of Nations,Great game and easy to use/play. Bought the game to keep my mind active and challenged and it does that. Have not done the expansion pack yet.
2,crap,"I Love This Game! But There Are 5 version of Rise of Nations and its Expansion on this one disk. It takes forever for my PC to open the contents on the disk. Part of my disk was unreadable... so the expansion did not get installed... great game, bad job by ubisoft on the remake."
1,Wrong Product Key's,"I got this game specifically to get the product key for the copy I bought several years ago.Unfortunately, when I got it, It came with a product key for an entirely different game!With what they gave me, the game was unplayable.Would not buy from this company again; and I would certainly not recommend it to others."
3,on sale,"Got Rise of Nations on sale for $20, wouldn't pay more than that...tip: turn game speed down; took 40 minutes game time to conquer world.Not worth playing second time round, have un-installed."
5,I Have No Life But ITS THE BEST GAME EVER!!,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER! IVE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS STRAIGHT! THIS GAME IS THE BEST EVER THE GRAPHICS ARE OK BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS AN AWSOME GAME!

4,Buffy/Angel/Commando crossover in the middle of Arizona.,"In this Buffy/Angel/Commando crossover, don't expect to see any of the Scooby Gang or LA crew. This is a novel that is based purely on the foursome, Buffy, Angel, Riley and Sam. There's not much to the plot or the significance of the crows. The main highlights are the interactions between the foursome. This writer is one that well understands the complexity of B/A and B/R. For most of the novel, Buffy and Riley play sidekicks, with Angel and Sam going undercover and getting most of the action and heat. One wonders how Angel could survive out there. Anyway, besides the past relationships, there's also Sam's crush on Angel, surprises along the way, B/A teary moments and the Sam and Buffy rivalry. Overall a book that takes place out of Sunnydale, out of LA and out of the Buffy and Angel verse. It takes the relationships of that genre and throws it out in the middle of Arizona and Mexico for some good roasting."
3,A published fanfic,Let me start by saying something none of the reviews have said which would be helpful to a reader going in. This book takes place in a alternate season 7. This fact was fine for me as i got the book from the library but I felt the need to state this fact much of the book as reviews have stated is about Riley and Sam who find out for no real reason during the novel there gonna have a kid. Angel is used very little in the book buffy even less. Dawn and Fred make cameos in this book as well. if you like Riley get this book if not get it from the library
3,Not Blood Crazy but close,"I am really into End of the World novels, and Stranger didn't let me down. I liked the storyline, and the pace of the book. I liked the characters, and the storyline most of all.It isn't as good as Bloodcrazy though. It has some similar features that Blood Crazy had, but I felt that Stranger had some loose ends in it. You never fully understand the hives, and what man was evolving into, or at least I didn't.That aside though I liked Stranger, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good End of the World book."
2,Doesn't Go Anywhere,"Despite the easy writing sytle this writer employs, this book never really goes anywhere in regards to plot. Many interesting plot potentials are brought up but never explored. Perhaps he wrote it this way for a sequel? If not, save your time."
3,Not even close to Blood Crazy,"I agree with the Publisher's Weekly review of the book. I enjoyed reading Stranger, but felt that it fell short, especially compared to Blood Crazy. Clark didn't really cover a whole lot of new ground, and his reason for the apocolypse seemed a little weak to me. Also, Clark's Americans seemed more British than anything, and I can't for the life of me remember a 19 year-old using phrases like ""Boy, that sure was a close one."" The whole deal with the hives and what they were, I felt, was unresolved. Regardless, there was plenty of action, suspense, and gory violence, which would entertain just about any horror fan."
2,Second-rate Clark,"Although I've been a major fan of Simon Clark's since first reading KING BLOOD years ago, STRANGER sadly feels more like a retread than anything else. While it does have its moments, they are few and far between amongst a rather uninvolving and confusing tale of zombies that aren't quite zombies. Clark never fully explains exactly what's going on in the story as a strange plague in South America begins killing people, driving the starving survivors northwards. Exactly when the plague shifts to making people insane with rage, or why some of the supposedly infected act perfectly normal while the hero of the story, Greg Valdiva, hacks them to pieces with an ax, is beyond me. The twist revelation at the end is merely confusing (at least to me). If end-of-the-world tales are you kind of thing, Clark has done two others that are much much stronger. King Blood and Blood Crazy. I suggest you check them out instead."
3,standard adapter,"This Casio ADK64AC adapter is a standard adapter, nothing special. It would have been improved if it was half the size. It is rather large bulky and an outlet hog."
4,Excellect and Convenient pod brewer,"I bought this machine in September at a retail store and I think it is one of the best designed pod brewer around, and I have done my research. I love the stainless steel and shape of the machine. You can use various brands of pods which is great. I drink only one cup of coffee before I leave for work and this makes it fast. So for anyone on the go this works good.This is my fourth pod brewer because the last three were defective but simplehuman customer service was great for the exchange of the machine for a new. I didn't have to paid a dime, Warranties do work!"
3,Won't Do Decaff Pods consistently,"This machine makes great regular coffee with pods and have never had any issues with regular pods of any brand. However, for some reason, this machine hates decaff pods of any brand also. We have been able to get it to work with decaff pods about 10 percent of the time. We called Simple Human and they blame it on the pods, (not flat enough, quality control, etc. But it's with ALL brands of decaff, and NO Problems with regular pods, who can figure? It makes about 2 ounces of decaff and then it acts like it's plugged and builds up pressure and we have to manually push it up to unlock and water sprays everywhere. Simple Human Customer service was useless and we are keeping it for use with Regular Coffee Pods (All brands) only. Too bad because we like decaff in the evening after dinner sometimes.We would give it a 5 star rating except for the decaff pod issue."
4,Good pod coffee maker for the price,"I have had a Senseo and 2 Gevalia pod coffee makers. Senseo made weak, tepid coffee no matter what I did and the Gevalia coffee maker leaked water so you ended up with what looked like really weak tea most of the time.The simplehuman coffee maker makes a good cup of coffee every time. I am the only coffee drinker in the house and I only drink 1 to 2 cups at a time. So it really does work well for me.It is not convenient if you have more than 1 or 2 coffee drinkers who drink multiple cups of coffee in a short period of time. My parents came to visit for 4 days and we went through 2 1/2 boxes of pods during that time."
1,Lasted 8 Months,My unit purchased from SimpleHuman worked great for 8 months then just quit. On 5/12/08 They authorized credit back to my credit card. Indicated that the product is discontinued and they are re-engineering a model for 2009.
1,DO NOT BUY,Best $130 water maker you can buy. Makes horrible coffee. Do not buy this or any pod coffee maker until they make one that taste like coffee. And this one you can not return. So DON't BUY !!!!
2,Spend a little more it will be worth your while,"Terrible picture quality when compared to the Q-See QSC48030 High Resolution Weatherproof CCD Camera w/100ft of Night Vision (Color). The one I received is on it way back for a refund, the QSC48030 has verygood night and day time picture quality and is worth the extra $$$'s."
4,Satisfied,"This camera has lasted well through a very snowy winter and a very rainy spring and 1/2 of an also rainy summer so far. Zero maintenance. The picture is clear - the night vision is adequate. Ours is mounted outside a third floor window pointing down into the front yard. You won't make out faces, but there's enough detail to get a decent description."
4,"A wee bit small, but generally fabulous!","This product is comparable to the Targus product PAUM01U. Both are about half the dimensions of a conventional mouse. The optical input means no more cleaning a track ball, making it ideal for travel and spontaneous use on any encountered surface. The retractable cable is a move of genius, long overdue, and works like a charm. And the USB connection is a snap, with no software needed.Only two cons: The carrying bag is functionally protective, though could perhaps be a bit more padded. And, to put the mouse into that bag, the wire has to bend just between the retracting device and the mouse itself; over time, that seems to risk breakage.But on balance? Fantastic. And for the price? Bravo!"
2,Brittle,"I've bought and used two of these devices now. They are superior to the in-built pointing devices on my notebook, but only initially. Within about a year, their tracking functionality begins to deteriorate: You can't left-click and hold and get the mouse to define a correct area, of text, of images, of whatever. My notebook is my main PC and this mouse gets very little travel abuse. Still it stops working, so be warned. It's as if ZIP-LINQ expects the consumer to be subscribing to their mouse instead of buying a quality product that lasts - NOT. I'd be open to other reviewer suggestions for a better more durable mini mouse; please reply to this review."
3,Carolyn's review--A.D.,"This was such a wonderful mini-series, but having 3 hrs. chopped off spoiled the whole thing--hope the original full lenghth will soon be available,"
1,Disappointed,"I was so disappointed in the movie ""A.D."" It is NOT at all the quality of acting or the accuracy of the movie ""Jesus of Nazareth"". They leave out so much of the Book of Acts. They do not even have St Paul meeting St Peter, and if you do not know the story already of St Paul's conversion, you would not know what even happened to him it is done so poorly. They have a lot of extra side stories that are not in the Bible. The acting is very poor. I do not recommend this movie at all."
2,Too much of the original movie left out!,I love this movie it is one of my favorites. Since I had the pleasure of seeing the original one I can't really enjoy it because too much of the original scenes have been cut out of this 6 hour edited edition. I'm waiting til the original 9 hour series becomes available on DVD and I'll purchase it then!
1,Who wants 2/3rd's of anything?,"I found a bootleg version of the full 9hr series at another web site for $50. I paid it because I wanted so badly. The source was the VHS version made into DVD-r's. Still very watchable. I've been copying it to anyone who'll pay for the time and cost to make it. Around $20(It takes 5 DVD's and I make a nice case to hold them in). As much as they have made off of Jesus of Nazareth you would think the sequel would have gotten more respect. Maybe that will change with blu ray, I hope so. My e-mail address is [..]"
2,Disappointment,"My wife and I purchased the VHS version of A. D. years ago and were sorely disappointed at the amount of footage that was left out of this DVD version. Why someone thought it necessary to reduce the length of this series is bewildering. In addition, the editing is poor so that even those who never saw the original may find the presentation uneven. Hopefully, those who produced the DVD will create one that is closer to the original VHS set."
2,Only Half the Story,"The original miniseries tells the story of how the Gospel spread beyond the people of the ""First Covenant,"" the Jews (Hebrews 8:7)into the pagan Roman world. The narrative device the miniseries uses for this purpose is to follow the struggles of a Jewish man and a Jewish girl as they travel into the heart of the arch-enemies of Israel, the city of Rome itself. Their quest is complemented by the search for meaning of a Roman man and a Roman girl. The reactions of the four people to the Gospel mirror in microcosm the various responses of Jewish and Gentile audiences to the Christian message. These accounts are shaped by the larger events of history and the political realities of the times. Unfortunately,this edited cut of the original guts most of the Roman background and thereby omits virtually half the story, resulting in a plot that is not connected as a dramatic cause-effect sequence. This truncated version is neither logically nor emotionally satisfying."
3,A.D.,"I would consider the film as informative to the new believer, but they did take liberties. It was more movie and did not follow scripture completely, but the basic idea was there. Seeing the old stars was entertaining, albiet distracting at times."
4,"Fourplay is ""Still the One""","Fourplay continues to play good jazz music. One noticable difference from this album is the extended vocal talent on some of the tracks. The bass lines are a little better than before, but still not as developed as they could be. However, if you're into upbeat jazz that keeps moving, you may want to experiment with some older Fourplay albums because this one has that slow ""Playboy"" sound to it on most of the tracks."
4,Smooth Jazz @ Four Play...,Thier name says it all... This album was created to set the mood right where you wantu be... Relaxed after long day on a Sunday afternoon with your Loved once... Am in Love with this one...Mokgabudi J
3,My other son took my first pair,My youngest son took my first pair so I bought a pair for myself. They really don't fit my head very good but the sound is good.
4,From a long time PC user.........,"I have to say after three months with this baby, I'm pretty satisfied. OS X is easy and manageable, and has never, ever crashed on me; applications have though. Yet, the keyboard does push into the screen slightly when closed, so you will see little keyboard marks on the screen when turned off. A few other problems are that the notebook can get very hot if a CPU intesive app is used and the 802.11b Wi-Fi looses some of it's range (about 150 ft) because the titanium is blocking signals."
5,"The Best Portable, Ever","This is my third Powerbook. Although not as sturdy as the Powerbook G3 500MHZ (Pismo) it is MUCH faster. And the screen is near perfect. It could still stand to be a higher resolution, but is perfect for DVD's."
4,This CD is great!,"I bought this CD for One Week, but I think that the other songs on this disc are even better than that one! BNL is a lot of fun! Their lyrics are good and their songs over all are great! They are even better in concert! But since I got hooked on BNL, I tried out their older stuff which is just as good, if not better. I encouraged you all to hear some of it too!"
4,Bears Listening To,"The timber of their voices is enough...the lyrics make you smile, the rhythyms, though familiar, are innovative and delicious"
4,The breakthrough fans have been waiting for,"Those crazy Canadian lads are back with their 4th studio album and it's pretty much business as usual. Fortunately for us, business as usual is pretty darn unusual. The songs run the gamut from pure nonsense to moving tenderness. These guys have the ability to by utterly ludicrous as on the surprise hit ""One Week"" and then give you an offbeat, charming song like ""Light Up My Room"" in the space of five minutes. Musically they are always pinpoint sharp. The melodies and arrangements continue to be fresh and new as the lyrics are clever, witty, and often touching. The Barenaked Ladies story goes like this; a bunch of geeks learned to play, they made great, intelligent, fun pop albums and nobody noticed. Then one day they had a hit... I hope it doesn't change them."
5,BNL RULE!!!,"I have every C.D. and ""Stunt"" has done it again. The only problem I have is that the radio play has burned out ""One week"". Not to worry, just plug in any other BNL C.D. and the same excitement will return. I have purchased several copys of their past work and given them to friends, and no one has ever been disapointed. Give up buying your next 12 pack, buy this C.D., and enjoy the ""alcohol"" off ""Stunt"", cuz it will last longer and leave you feeling great in the morning. After you hear ""Stunt"" and you need a little ""Hair of the dog"", try ""Rock Spectacle"" or ""Gordon"". They will set you free."
1,I HATE THIS C.D.,THIS C.D IS SUCH A WASTE OF TIME WHY IT WAS MADE I HAVE NO IDEA. AT ONE TIME IT WAS GREAT NOW THEY DO NOT EVEN PLAY IT ON THE RADIO.
1,This C.D. is not a buyer,I bought this C.D. about five months ago and loved it now I almost hate it. The music video could use some work to. The only good song is one week and that song gets old fast. The rest of the songs suck.
1,trash,this cd is absolute trash. it is especially disapointing considering some of the great stuff that bnl released earlier (gordon!). don't bother buying this one. btw - i only gave it one star because zero wasn't an option.
1,"Oh man, lemme just say ""Yuck""","Am I the only person on the face of the earth that hated this??? This latest attempt of the Barenaked ladies is nothing more than cheezy pop. One Week is probably the most pretentious song I've ever heard!!!! They are only adding to the degradation of rock music. Unless you really, really LIKE poppy, peppy, senseless rock music, don't buy this one. Save the music!!!!"
3,"Some songs amazingly wonderful, yet others dull!","I got this CD just to listen to ""One Week"". It is the most awesome, new, upbeat, fun song ever. It is definitly getting play on my CD player. I was left dissapointed however, with the rest of the CD. While ""Never Is Enough"" and ""Some Fantastic"" were pretty good, they lacked the upbeat fun nature I was hoping for. If their tone is what you are looking for, they are definitly excellent songs. The other great song on this CD is ""Who Needs Sleep"". I recommend this CD, but check it out first somewhere you can listen to the whole thing, cause the whole CD is not one feeling to me. E-mail me with what you think."
2,Mediocre & Depressing.,"As a longtime BNL fan, I rabidly awaited their next instudio album. The wait was for naught. Whereas this may be a nice album for those who have never heard the genius of Gordon, or Maybe You Should Drive, this will do. Anyone who considers themselves an old school BNLs fan *will* be disappointed, as commercialism has apprently taken over creativity in this effort."
1,Pop-crap at its crappiest.,"I just recently bought this cd, thinking that it would be as cool as the gordon, but guess what? It isn't. I ESPECAILLY HATE One week. What the hell were these guys thinking when they made such stupid and meaningless lyrics, that sound like they were made for a 4 year old girl. ""Watch me now, and wow a hoodwink, i make you stop think, think i'm lookin' at aquaman""? What the HELL? there are no meanings in these long lines of stuff you'd hear at 7 in the morning on a kids cartoon show. Dont buy this cd."
2,God save us from this album,"When I first heard the song One Week,I wanted to get something of Barenaked Ladies,so I got there live cd.After realizing the song wasn't on there,I bought Stunt.Believe me,the Barenaked Ladies have gone down in this cd.The live album(comprised of older songs,obviously) is an excellent cd.Their new stuff just reminds me too much of the sixties especially with tracks like,""It's All Been Done"".A horrible cd and I don't recommend it to anyone except for teeny-boppers"
5,Barenaked as they wanna be,"Although many new listeners have just heard of the Ladies being born and raised near their hometown I grew up listening to these guys. We came to know them for Enid and Yoko Ono. These songs however are a bit different. The ladies it seems have changed from their comedic two bit jokes to real musicians what they wanted to be all of their lives. From A to Z there is not a bad song on the lot except possibly some flaws in Leave. Great album, my favourite cut would have to be Light Up my Room where Ed sings. If you want to know more about the old stuff from the ladies listen to Some Fantastic. You Canucks will know what I mean."
4,It's good.,"This CD has some great songs like One Week, It's all Been Done, and Call and Answer, and some not so good ones like lchohol and who needs slepp. When I first heard of them I thought they were just another ""scream-as-loud-as-you-can-into-the -microphone"" kind of band. But when I listened to them, I relized that they're not, and that they're actually very good."
3,One-Hit Wonder,"I agree with everyone that says One Week is a great song. But there aren't that many other good songs on this album. Plus, the songs get old after awhile. Finally, ifyou buy the CD (get it only if it's on sale), pass up the last song ""When you Dream"". It is too slow and makes you wanna fall asleep."
2,Jumping off as the bandwagon begins: this album a letdown,"After three outstanding albums and countless up-close and personal shows, it is time to sell the CDs and jump off the wagon. They have joined the rest of pop America for the $, and don't blame them, but this album stinks. My one request is that they change their name because this is not the same band. Cramming in with 20,000 people at a show is not the BNL. How I long for the Riv in Chicago or the show at EMU!"
5,"An incredible CD, BNL's best","I'm not very good at describing music. but I do know what I like, and I think that this is one incredible CD.I think another reviewer hit it on the mark perfectly explaining that the songs on this CD combine beautiful sounding melodies and lyrics, but when you actually listen to the words you find they are often dark and disturbing, and they question conventional attitudes and social mores.It's intellectual music, and I love it.The only downside to this CD is that it doesn't get this good again. I bought Maroon and Maybe You Should Drive, and sadly discovered that BNL's other CDs just don't reach this level of accomplishment."
3,The whole is less than the sum of its parts.,"This CD is full of good songs, but nothing great. A great CD should have some variety or a few awesome songs. While individually each song here is a 4 star song, when you put them together you get a rather forgetful album. There are better places to put your money, but it's an easy listen. I'd probably give this an extra half star if that were an option, but it's not and It's not going to effect me enough to make it a 4 star album."
4,"Overall its good, but a few flaws","I bought this cd because of ONE WEEK and ITS ALL BEEN DONE. If you're thinking about this for those two, you may want to reconsider. Most of the rest are light pop, and then it gets to the horribly boring WHEN YOU DREAM. ONE WEEK is an outstanding song, but it's very much different from all the others."
5,A great band finally gets it's due,"This is a fantastic album by a band that has been making great music for 10 years. If you bought BNL for ""One Week"" then I highly recommend you check out their other albums. They are all of equal or better quality."
5,Great pop hooks that reel you in; Fun energetic music!,"The Ladies have a strong groove, due to endless live touring experience. When they lock in, they hit the ground running, man! This cd is full of fun music to listen to! I love these guys! The hooky choruses grab you right of the bat. I think every song is great. This is one of those bands that sounds better with every album, and this is their best yet."
4,a great CD,"I'm looking at all these reviews and it seems like half the population bought Stunt JUST for the song One Week! Geez. If you buy a CD JUST for one song, prepare to be disappointed.Anyway, I absolutely adore this CD and I think I've listened to it approximately 6 billion times. I really enjoy most of the songs, though I do tend to skip ""Leave"" and ""When you Dream."" The lyrics are wonderfully bizarre. It's such a refreshing change from all the angst-filled, scream at the sky, OD on drugs punks yelling into a mike and calling it ""music.""I only give this 4 stars because it does tend to get just a little old after awhile. I used to listen to it all the time, but now I find that I only spin it in my player every once in awhile. But don't hesitate! If you don't have it, get it!"
3,Is it worth it for only a few good songs?,"This CD has a couple really good songs, a few marginal ones, and few that outright suck. The problem with the good songs is that they've been played on the radio so much that even if you did like them once, you're probably sick of them by now. So what it comes down to is this: are you willing to shell out your cash for those few good songs? Because quite frankly, the rest of the CD is pretty weak in comparison to the first 2 songs."
2,Mediocre & Depressing.,"As a longtime BNL fan, I rabidly awaited their next instudio album. The wait was for naught. Whereas this may be a nice album for those who have never heard the genius of Gordon, or Maybe You Should Drive, this will do. Anyone who considers themselves a BNL fan *will* be disappointed."
3,OK,"I thought Stunt as a whole was not that great. I skip every track execp for One Week, It's All Been Done, and Alchohol. The cd is worth the money for those 3 tracks alone though. Buy it if you want, or you can get the singles for those three songs. I don't know if Alchohol has one but I've seen the videos for One Week and It's All Been Done and heard them on the radio."
1,"A ""stunt"" gone bad","One indication you know a CD S**KS is when you see it appear 500 million times in the used CD bin at CD warehouses. Look, just because this is the latest stuff coming out over the radio doesn't mean you have to listen to it. Out of reflex, my hand immediately punches the station button on my radio anytime I hear the sorry, lame ""One Week"". And to anyone who asserts this is the ""best CD of the 90's"" - what? Give me a break. Go listen to any Nirvana , Liz Phair, Bjork, PJ Harvey, Elastica, Foo Fighters or Portisehead CD before you come back and make that claim."
4,It's NOT all been done before...,"BNL has created a new ""old"" album that I listen to time after time. My 60's band covers ""It's All Been Done"" and it fits nicely into our old format. I can't wait to hear future recordings - and definitely catch them in person next month!"
5,A true stunt indeed!,"How do they do it? Once again the Barenaked Ladies deliver a wonderful album that is guaranteed to deliver a smile. This album is spectacular, its upbeat and amusing lyrics never cease to disappoint, as well in this album we see a more serious side to The Bare Naked ladies, a side that yearns to be explored! Imagine, their soft and more serious side being as cool and individual as their party hat side! ""Alcohol"" is by far the greatest song they have ever produced; this song is a pure hit at parties! The Bare Naked Ladies are truly wonderful artists, and well, if their half as crazy in real life and they are with their songs, be sure to sign me up!"
4,David Duchovny sold me this CD,"I enjoyed Barenaked Ladies, and I enjoyed the song ""One Week,"" however, seeing David Duchovny from my favorite show ""The X-Files"" have a blast playing with the band on the Leno show recently is what actually got me to buy this CD. I wish the band would do a video featuring David for the song ""It's All Been Done."""
2,"PRETTY UNMEMORABLE EXCEPT FOR ""ONE WEEK""","Like some other reviewers, I bought this CD for ""One Week"". It remains a great song, but the rest of this album kind of disappointed me. They all sound pretty much the same and they're just not that great. I like some of the other lyrics though, 'cause its all tongue-and-cheek, they're funny, whatever. Overall, I could have found a better use of my money."
1,It is a terrible cd.,"If u get this cd, I guarante u will hate it. It has two good songs and the rest are slow and boring. Don't buy it, get Cake instead."
1,Late 90's Rock.............God help us!!!,"Just like Matchbox 20, and a group of other ""original"" musicians, Barenaked Ladies seems to be making music that they want everyone to like. Some of their older stuff is actually good, but they have now walked into the pitfall of the post-grunge era, which is boring, third rate music that means zero creativity and 100% sales. It's a sad thing to see, but with every changing decade there is a musical revolution. Real music fans, not to worry, these 90's pop groups will be forgotten in years to come."
3,"Lyrics are original, music needs help.","I recently was given this CD, and after hearing ""One Week"" I looked forward to hearing what else this group had recorded. I was somewhat disappointed. The songs never seem to get on track; the tempos don't seem to fit. A good CD, but not a great one."
4,Check the hidden tracks!,"Finally, new stuff from the Ladies. ""Never is Enough"" has such a catchy tune and insightful lyrics. Why travel to Europe just to sit in a pub and drink with foreigners? AmenBe sure to catch the first hidden track. Don't know the name, but any guy doin' the nasty at the wrong time of the month will be grinning from ear-to-ear when he hears this one. Buy this now and buy it often!"
5,BNL is ALOT better than the Crapstreet Boys and N' Stink!,"The first time I saw ""One Week"" on MTV, I really wanted the CD. After hearing it like 40 times, I finally saved enough money to buy it. ""It's All Been Done"" is my favorite song, and the video is good too. ""Light up my Room"" is okay, and so are 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11. I'm probably gonna let my mom listen to Leave because she loves country. ""Call and Answer"" is also great, one of my favorites. I listen to ""Who Needs Sleep"" when I try to go to sleep...amazingly, it HELPS me! ""Some Fantastic"" is really good. Now, ""When You Dream"" is a pretty bad song-probably because I don't like serious things. Did anyone hear about the ""It's All Been Done"" single coming out on the 9th?"
3,"""Now my fans are crying sellout...""","It's odd how prophetic that song is. I used to be a fan, but, well, there are three good songs on Stunt: ""Never is Enough,"" ""Who Needs Sleep,"" and the bonus ""Long Way Back Home."" (Hence the three stars.) BNL really did sell out with this one. It's nothing compared to Gordon or MYSD. Their concerts are getting progressively more disappointing. Moxy Fruvous does everything BNL does and more, only they do it better. I may still buy BNL albums, (and even go to a few more shows) but Stunt managed to destroy my BNL obsession."
3,At least they have a cool name!,"At first when I got this album, I loved it. It was great. I listened to it virtually nonstop for 3 months. But then I got tired of it, and the songs just got old. They were all now overplayed on the radio, and one week was the only cool song. I recommend you NOT buy it."
1,one hit and that's it 2nd rate R.E.M,after hearing one week i thought this disc might be interesting? wrong it was boring.it sounded like watered down R.E.M.who is flat nowadays themselves.
2,hmmm......,this cd was a huge dissapointment. some of their songs made absolutely no sense and there was only about one song i actually liked.
4,Very Very Good...,"The ladies have done it again. Catchy tunes and goofy lyrics that somehow have a deeper meaning that anyone can relate to... And ""One Week"" compacts the most lyrics into a song under three minutes that you care to count. Just try to memorize them!"
2,Just for One week.,"I asked for this CD simply for one week(the song). But I found that there are no songs on it except one week that are good. They aren't bad, and with a faster beat like one weak I would defintly like this CD more. But it was worth it for one week."
5,The Ladies' Best Work To Date,"I've been a die-hard fan from the beginning, and they just keep getting better and better. Unlike most people, I don't think ""One Week"" is the best song. In fact, I usually skip over it, and listen to the rest of the album.EVERY song is good, several are great. My personal favorites are ""Alcohol,"" ""In the Car,"" and ""Who Needs Sleep?"""
5,Great CD,"A whimsical, musical CD. One of my sisters lives next door to big electrical thingies, so ""Light Up My Room"" applies to her. I like the lulluby at the end ""When You Dream."""
3,Surely not the best!!!,Surely not the best!!!! BNL's other cds blow this one away. 'Gordon' and 'Rock Spectacle' are much better than 'Stunt'.
3,"If you are trying BNL for the first time, don't buy this CD.","I was so disappointed when I bought Stunt. After hearing ""One Week"" on the radio, I figured Stunt would be filled with the nifty plays on words and unmatched wit in the lyrics of songs on past albums, Gordon in particular. What I found was a bunch of simple songs with repetitive melodies and lyrics that don't seem to be much better than the average pop rock band. This CD is better than Maybe You Should Drive, but doesn't come close to Gordon or Born On a Pirate Ship, both of which showed that these guys have extaordinary talents. Barenaked Ladies are still better than any other pop rock bands out there, but the material in this CD doesn't live up to this BNL fan's expectations."
3,"This new cd is pretty good, but way too trendy.","Try some of BNL's older stuff before buying this one. I'm not saying ""Stunt"" isn't a good cd, but I think their old cds are more Barenaked Ladies quality."
3,STUNT,"I gave this CD 3 stars because in the song ""one week"" they had taken out part of the lyrics. ""Like Luke Skywalker gotta big hunch/Hey that's my lunch/Yoda's a really really old guy."" That just is NOT fair!"
1,what happened?,"it's really a shame that after the band's clever and funny debut album, gordon, they've taken such a nosedive. the lyrics to the abysmal rap on 'one week' are torturous. it's another example of a band becoming wildly popular after their best work is behind them."
2,disappointing,"My college roomate introduced me to this band, but aer hearing this album I almost wished that he hadn't. It is an album of sappy music which lacks thought and direcion. With the exception of ""One Week,"" which after a few listens becomes extreamly annoying, this is a truly bland record."
4,"good music, bad visuals","I like this group, but I find it disappointing that they feature no nude women on their cover art. Their name is very deceptive. The should really be called fully clothed Canadian dorks."
3,"Good CD, but surely not BNL's best!!!","I've been a BNL fan for seven years and I would have to say that this is by far not the best CD that they have put out. I enjoy listening to it throughly, but ""Gordon"" and ""Maybe You Should Drive"" are way better. I own six of their CDs and Stunt gets the least amount of playtime in my CD player. ""Gordon"" is more fun and ""Maybe"" is musically more accurate. I do love ""Alcohol"" and ""She's on Time"" though. Thanks for all of the great music BNL!!!"
1,canada must be invaded,"Why do I say that? To stop Canadian bands like BNL from polluting our airwaves here in the States. And it ain't like this is something new. We've already had to deal with Lover Boy, Rough Trade, Harlequin and Crash Test Dummies. And no, Neil Young doesn't make up for all of that bilge. Canada should stick to producing hockey players and bland television anchors and never, ever try to rock."
1,Barenaked Ladies fans shouldn't breed,"BNL are unspeakably godawful. I'd prefer to have a pickaxe driven through my spinal column than ever hear ""One Week"" ever again. Pure evil."
1,Barenaked ladies stunt,"This CD was ok,""One week"",and'its all been done"" were ok,until i fell asleep.Dont waste your money."
5,"""Their best yet""","This recordings funny lyrics catchy tune makes it there best one. ""One Week"" is a great song with famous names in it(the Ladies like famous names) like Leann Rimes, Sting, Harrison Ford, Snickers. It just makes it hilarious. Lines like ""Ok I don't make mad films but if I did I'd have a samaraii leave you laughing the rest of the day. It's easy to sing along."
5,Great CD,One Week- Awesome my favorite song on this CD ***** It's All been done- good **** Light up my room ***and a half I'll be that girl **** Leave *** Alcohol **** Call and Answer *** In the car ** Never is enough **** Who needs sleep? **** and a half told you so *** Some fantastic **** When you dream ***
4,"Great album, but where r the extra tracks??","Great album, but I can't find the extra tracks. (I know they're not listed as tracks, I realize that), but they should b at the end of the album and they're not. Oh, well, I'm happy with it otherwise!"
4,BNL Goes Mainstream,"This is the first of the megahit rap tunes BNL has done, that being One Week. This also sparks the band's emergence onto the mainstream rock circle, and a departure from the Alternative. The use of grunge guitars is prevalent, and I would begrudge the band for departing from their earlier style, which I fell in love with in Gordon, but they do this style so competently, that the album is darned near perfect. The only slow spot on this disc is the ending with When You Dream, which is the only reason this disc doesn't get 5 stars. Aside from that, the pop stylings are fun to listen to, and the writing is consistently clever. If you like the stuff that's been playing on the radio, it all started here, and approach the old stuff with caution."
4,Great but not nearly as good as the Early stuff,"Ok, I love this CD, and yes go out and buy it but if this the CD that got you into BNL, as it did with me =), you really need to get Gordon, Rock Spectacle, MYSD, BOAPS, they are even better. oh and my personal favorite song on this CD is When You Dream."
5,a different kind of album,"This is one of my favorite cds. The BareNaked Ladies' songs are so different, and unlike some other bands, they're all orginal and none sound alike. The songs are all great, some fun, some that make you think, a couple relaxed. This album rocks."
5,Insightful and acurate translation into conversational prose,"I have many I-Ching books, and I find this one the best for natural clear prose, to communicate to other people in conversational language, the key threads in the Hexagrams. The other books are poetic, and need for me to do more translation to convey how each hexagram may apply to a situation. I highly recommend this book for experienced as well as newbies to the I-Ching. Note that the I-Ching says about itself that it is for not only scholars but for the common folk as well. This book is for the Rest of Us, and also for scholars will find it highly accurate."
2,"O.K., but...","The easy-to-use guide and coins are a nice feature to this book, but in the edition I got, the Casting of the Coins section contradicts itself. Makes it rather confusing for someone who is a beginner."
4,What's the Point?,"Considering that the point of a chicken plucker is to pluck chickens, you'd think there would be at least one chapter on building them.Instead, the author wants me to buy his second book for instructions to make the chickens and I have a hunk-of-a-useless-apparatus taking up half of my garage that took me a week to build. And nothing to pluck."

5,Great Quality,"If you love the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. Its high quality recordings at its fine-est. Order your copy today!"
2,Liked the cast recording much better!,"Well, as much as I hate to supply the only negative review, I liked the Cast recording so much better that I could do without the movie soundtrack. Now I LOVED the movie and I love all the music. But this recording sounds really sketchy to me, almost more like a rehearsal than the real thing. The first time I heard it I was literally shocked. I could hardly believe this was the newest version of the soundtrack. Maybe I'm crazy, but I played the Original cast recording for my brother the day after he bought this one, to see what he thought, and he said he'd have taken the movie soundtrack back if it hadn't been a gift. I swear, I've listened to the whole thing twice and I can't stand it. I tried, believe me I really want to like it, but I cant! My advice is buy the Original Cast recording, or at least buy both and see what you think. But if you only buy this CD you're missing out on alot of the energy and attitude that made this such a powerful production."
5,heaven knows,there's this annual movie festival in rio...there's always one movie that strikes you down in a way...the music...hedwig
3,Love the score-not the soundtrack,"I absolutely love this show!! I'm going to see it's running in Washington for 7th time. On this soundtrack it seems the only people who realize that this music is ""rock"" are the musicians. John Cameron Mitchel has a beautiful voice but.....he lacks the energy I think follow with the part of Miss Hedwig Robinson. My favorite performance of this part is by Aaron Berk. He is fabulous! He follows the music as it goes from rock to heavy metal to ballads to almost-country. See his fansite for more info."
5,HEDWIG rocks the big screen!,"I've been a huge fan of HEDWIG AND THE ANGRY INCH for a couple of years, and I'm thrilled to see that it's making such a brilliant transition to the screen. Stephen Trask's score is dynamite rock theatre at its beast, and as for the cast, John Cameron Mitchell IS Hedwig. Period, end of story. No one can play her like him. Miriam Shor is fab as Yitzhak.In comparison to the earthshattering Original Cast Recording, this HEDWIG might not sound as polished, but the earthier tone suits the realism of the film perfectly. You simply can't go wrong with Trask's score and Mitchell's ""Hedwig."""
3,Not as good w/o the movie,Some of the songs don't have the same punch without the brilliant visuals from the movie. I could be wrong but some seem like different versions. Still worth having if you love the movie as much as I did.
5,Amazing,"This is one of the best musicals out there and the soundtrack is most representive of that. It's in an odd order, but all the music that you loved from the movie (and I am presuming the show) is there, waiting to be enjoyed. Listen and fall in love!!"
3,good but inferior to the original stage version,"I disagree with the editorial review and think that the original cast recording is much superior to the film soundtrack. This feels just too studied and polished. Hedwigs anger in the harder numbers seems muted here and the slower numbers are a lot less affecting. Worst of all is the new version of Origin Of Love, which leaves me pretty much cold here, while the original recording turnes it into one of the most heartbreaking love songs I ever heard.The numbers are still great, but much of their power has been drained by the slick production and John Cameron Mitchell never comes fully alive here."
5,Loving Hedwig!,"Fans of the movie ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" will obviously love this soundtrack. However, the stirring music and powerful lyrics provide a wonderful listening experience for any audience. I highly recommend this soundtrack because of the range of emotions that place you down in the lowest depths with Hedwig at her worst and lift you high with hopeful romanticism as she finds herself. Give it a try!!!"
5,my lord and personal savior,As soon as I got out of the theatre I drove around trying to pick up this soundtrack! So great. The music is just plain amazing. Even my parents liked it and they're tough.
2,low budget but funny,this movie is low budget but actually had me laughing at the realities of the subjects....its a really crazy movie with alot of urban humor...
3,Nikon WT-1a,"I had it connected to my D2x. To set it up working, the WT-1a requires a lot of technical knowhow. If you are the average (or even pro photog)whose computer tech skills are limited, you will hardly get it done. Even if you were successful linking the WT-1A to your computer, maintaining that link in the long run is an irritant because of some glitches that happen from time to time. Transmission time is not that fast as I had anticipated. It takes time for the WT-1a to link-up and ""find"" your laptop. I have not used it yet with a desktop (could be faster). I had no problems transmitting JPEGs. I tried RAW files and it takes ages waiting for completion of transmission. For the $106 I paid Cameta, it was worth the try. I just wonder why other stores are selling it for over $300."
1,Not hoover brand,"Just recieved these bags and they are not Hoover brand. They are envirocare brand, this is false adverstising since the brand and picture are hoover. The seller should update this listing so it is not misleading for other customers."
4,Hoover bags,Good price for a basic micro filitration vac bag. It works well in my vac. Woudl buy again. Thank you
1,Hurl Tour,"Maybe it's my fault for not doing a little more research on this, but I thought it was an RPG. But then I found out - after playing - that it was a skateboarding game. It's no Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, but I shouldn't be comparing it to anything. The first level is scary, and not the kind you'd want in a videogame. I didn't know what to do! And then there was a guy to fight. Get this, he throws pumpkins at you. But who puts bosses in a skateboarding game? Too much man. I'll tell you what was wrong with this game, they spread it out too much with too many elements. They should've stuck to the skateboarding thing, maybe with collecting six skulls or whatever, but keep the bosses out. And for some reason, this is in the ""Adventure Section,"" but if you're like me and were hunting for an RPG, check the Role-Playing section. There should be some good ones in there."
3,Not his first album,"Despite the editorial review, this is not Randy Scruggs first album. He and his brother, Gary, released two albums in the 70's, as the Sruggs Brothers. The first (which is the best and as good as Crown) ia apparently unavailable. The second is available on Amazon. Search ""scruggs"""
4,ONE OF A KIND,"VERY ,VERY GOOD CD, NOT ALL SONGS MAKE YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU WANT BUT TAKE ONE LISTEN TO THIS CD AND I THINK YOU WILL BE PUT WHERE YOU WANT TO BE! THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR LOVERS OF MUSIC"
4,Following Claire on Another Great Mystery,"What fun this book was to read! I love Claire Gulliver. She pays attention to her feelings and acts upon them--thank goodness! Once I got into this book, I realized I'd read the first one and felt like I was visiting an old friend--one who has great adventures. What I like best about Claire is she isn't a super sleuth but an ordinary person who finds herself in extraordinary circumstances. Highly recommended.Marilyn Meredith, the author of the Deputy Tempe Crabtree mystery series."
5,Washington Weirdos - Another 5 star book from Gayle Wigglesworth!,"This is the second novel in the Claire Gulliver Series and as the title suggests, its setting is Washington D.C. Clair is a San Francisco bookstore owner who specializes in travel books and who is invited to D.C. to attend a gala given in her honor. Once again, Claire is thrown into a situation fraught with danger. Mrs. Wigglesworth, herself a world traveler, fills her books with details and information that only an experienced traveler would discern. Her characters are richly developed and the plot is intricately woven. Unlike Dame Agatha, Mrs. Wigglesworth plays fair with the clues so at the end of the novel the reader experiences an ""aha"" moment.A terrific read! I can't wait for her next novel. Keep them coming!Diana L. Driver"
4,The excitement starts on page one,"This is the second book in the Claire Gulliver series by Gayle Wigglesworth who writes wonderful light mysteries with no graphic sex and violence to get in the way of the plot. Her books cannot really be called Who-done-its because fairly early it is apparent, however that doesn't spoil the story in the least.Her characters (the good guys, that is) fill my requirement that they be the kind of people I would like to hang out with. Her main character, Claire Gulliver, is easy to identify with as she is a working self-sufficient woman facing new experiences.Her descriptions of places, ships and food bring a satisfying depth to the story. The touch of romance is just right and doesn't overshadow the mystery.I am looking forward to the next Claire Gulliver Mystery."
3,best of sports athems from se12,"it seems this is a mix of new songs, rerecorded songs and previously recorded tunes. not a bad cd. and if you have all their other albums, theres only a song or 2 on here youve not heard. so unless you find it dirty cheap it may not be worth buying"
3,Fun & Borring,the game is pretty fun in mutiplayer but it stinks in single player. i beat campain mode in 2 days easy game but it has extra's bonus objectives which unlocks vidio's multipler maps and a Star Wars song player and a part where you can look at the characters. Multiplyer is great in one level you can be in the geneous battle arena where you are on a team in the catory of acadmy with one other ship one but is a secret level the rest is in ships my fovorite is a thing called conquest where you build bases. then there is control zone basicly king of the hill.and of course there's a dual option
4,fell short of a perfect clone in many areas,first off its short. next its easy and the ai is [garbage]. but the atxt and the republic gunship are awsomeYODA IS AVAILABLE NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE TELLS U IF THEY SAY HE ISN'T TELL THEM TO BEAT EVERY BONUS CHALLENGE and the mulit player lacks ai its not that its bad but there isnt any but if u have a frend or sibling who loves starwars as much as u then buy this and enjoy it... THE GUNSHIP IS UNDER USED THE TANK IS OVER USED AND THE ATXT IS BORING IN SINGLE PLAYER DUE TO ITS SLOWNESS. IN CONCLUSION THE ROUGE LEADER OF GROUND COMBAT
4,Pretty good,"This game is really fun! The first couple of levels on geonosis are defintetly the best. This game isnt for everyone though, it can get pretty dry and repetive. My suggestion is DO NOT BUY, RENT! then decide if you like it. If you want a good starwars game get this game, rogue leader, or bounty hunter."
3,Star b+,"This game is good but its a little boring and hard:tank:fast,weak,rapid.Ther all like the tank.But in multiplayer you get a laser gun or a light sabor.I recomend this!"
3,Good game but not so great gameplay,I brought this game only a few days after it came out. It was really fun but the game sometimes can seen too straightforward. I mean there is a giant arrow the tells you which way you have to go in order to beat the mission. There is no oppertunity to explore and discover the level. In some levels you end up following a laid out path just shooting and shooting. Now this game is lots of fun if you're just into action and great graphics but first think about what you want in the game. It's a smart idea to rent the game first.
5,Great,"Ill make this small this could be the breakthroughfor gamcube to show how good it is actualy is.This game will definitly be better than the first starwars game for gamcube rouge squadron.I give this game 5 stars becuase it has good graphics,multiplayer play,and playing the missions will be a hella fun.The thing it like the most is to be in a republic gunship touring over the battle launching missles bellow and ahead.I am realy looking forward for this game.BUY IT IT'S GREAT"
2,Rent It,This game was way to easy to beat. I thought it would be so cool to fly around in a Gunship or an AT-TE and blow stuff up but it was a total bore. You don't even get to control an At-te (which is just one of the coolest vechiles. The only fun level was Geonosis and the ones where you are Jedi it is to hard to control your character. But if you have the time rent it because you will beat it in 1 or 2 days. Even hardcore fans (which I am) will find it a total disgrace to the Star Wars Universe. Go for Bounty Hunter
4,Lucas Arts has created a great game!,"Now first off, I'm a huge Star Wars fan, so ofcourse when I heard Lucas Arts was creating a game based on the Clone Wars, I couldn't wait to get it! Now that I have it, I'm pleased to say its a great game with only a few problems. The only major lacking problem really is the framerate. At times it often slows down or stops for a few seconds but this doesn't happen too often. For the most part it rides smooth as silk. The graphics and sound are great as well as the replay value and its just packed with codes and extra goodies! And finally decent multiplayer in a Star Wars game, yay! Overall, this is definately up there for best SW game with Rogue Leader, in my opinion."
4,its awsome.,"my brother bought this item. i gave it 4 stars total because you can lightsaber duel, fly in ships, and lots of other cool stuff. my brother and i won the whole game!!!!!! all of this stuff i talked about = AWSOME!!!"
4,It's an ok game,This I admit is actually an ok game it is just it doesn't have a certain sparkle to it but hey thats just me. This game is mostly based you as Mace Windu but who does'nt like Mace. This game is almost always based in a vehicle. Sometimes it lets you out of the vehicle to hack away at Droids.ProsPlay as jediGreat multiplayer modeConsBad voice oversnot all that great graphics
5,Great game,"Campaign-mode gameplay moves between Rogue Leader / Battle of Naboo style vehicle action and Obi-Wan style Jedi action. But the multi-player modes are the most fun - from the head-to-head vehicle Demolition-like duels to ""capture-the-flag"" (i.e., base) and more. Overall, the graphics are well done and the sound is superb. Highly recommended for the Star Wars fan."
4,F is fires that burn down the city,"The graphics are really outdated and the views are terrible, the voice overs sounds half dead and the text is filled with errors. There aren't really words to describe why this in an actual good game. You just have to play it. If you can overlook all the issues its very fun and very addicting. You start out trying to get rescued from an island that is sinking after a large earthquake and end up sneaking around a solving the mystery of why this happened. You never know exactly what is going to happen. Instead of fighting zombies and bad guys you are fighting mother nature. building are collapsing on you, floors are caving, fires, flooding, and whirlpools. The story twists and there are puzzles to solve and choices to make that decide how the game will end. You can be the good guy or a complete jerk. The game in all is pretty short and some of the endings make it shorter. All in all its a very fun and addicting game that I would recommend to anybody."
3,Surprisingly addictive,"Love this game. The only thing I hate is the pan/camera function is ackward and minimally responsive. Other than that, love it!!"
3,"Unique role-playing fun...if you like earthquakes, that is...","This is a good game with a great concept. The sound effects and scale really bring you into the experience in ways the graphics fail to do. If you place more emphasis on gameplay, you'll find this to be a rewarding, unique game.My biggest issue is not with the game, but the delivery from Target and the way it's represented on Amazon. The game was shipped by USPS even though Amazon said it was via UPS. Since UPS doesn't ship to PO Boxes, Amazon said I had to have this sent to my home address. This caused me to run a series of errands to pick up my package since my home mailbox is too small to fit a game into. If I knew it was going to be shipped via USPS, I would have had it sent to my PO Box along with the rest of the stuff on my order."
2,Did not work out for me,"This has the consistency of vegetable shortening. It goes on in clumps of white mess and does not lather very well. When I'm done, I have to wipe down the tub from all the white clumps which stick to the walls of the tub. I was unable to squeeze the contents into my shower soap dispenser, resorting to a cutting the bottle open with a knife and scooping the contents out with a spoon. Other than that, it felt good on my skin.I found a better product, which has less chemicals, lathers better, feels better on my skin, and behaves more like a liquid than a solid. Check outMethod Pure Naked Moisturizing Body Wash - Olive Leaf with Aloe Vera -- 18 fl oz"
1,poorly made,"this was useless. it was a mess of paper punch-outs and a flimsy fabric pocket system. (amazon wants me to write more, i don't know what else to say other than this was crap.)"
3,Alright Game,"This is a game that I would pay to rent it, but i would NEVER buy it. First what is a MIB game without the Noisy Cricket.There is no two player. I mean there is two agents in the game so there should be a 2 player. And I don't think that the graphics pushed the limit on the PS2. What I mean is that it has ok graphics, but the could have been better. And then the sound was alright, but also they could have been better. But the gameplay is great. The fun factor would be a 10. This game was very fun.I always wanted to play it. So over all this game is one to rent first and then decide if you are going to get it or not."
2,dont buy it!,"this game isnt what you would think it was.Shure its fun at first,until you find out that you can't save games,you only get 3 lives and are outnumbered 1 billion to 1.you should only get this game if you have a game shark because this game is so new that there arent any codes for it.SAVE YOURSELF 30 BUCKS....DONT BUY OR RENT IT!"
3,OK game,"I tried this game in a curcit city first and liked it. When i brought it home i tried it and it was really hard. you have to beat a whole level before you can save and the levels are long. They lock up the training missione from the start and you have to beat levels to open them. If you like a really good challenge you should get it, but rent it first."
2,please RENT IT,"OK... MIB is a very good concept for movies and games, but this title isn't the best ...but isn't the worst... an for my point of view this is the Pros and ConsPros1-Real Challenging game... when you sit in front your TV... ...move fast ant try to end the level... 'cause theres no way that you can save your progress during the level.2- Graphics... could be better.3-... I already finished 4 levels and the bosses are not so difficult... but reach them is [a] pain ...Cons...1- The music... ouch!, some times you will think on turn off the volume.2- The caracters... where is Tommy Lee and Will Smith...3- The Voices...same thing4- Keep the upgrades on your weapons... is real difficult... when you reach their maximun power is very easy to kill a dozen of aliens... but each time that you get shoot, you loose your upgrades...5- The SAVE thing... why you cant save your progress during the level?..."
3,Really difficult.,This the the hardest game I have ever played. I couldn't beat the first leval I played it a hundred times. I kept getting farther and farther but the levels was long and extremly difficult with hundreds of aliens poping up out of everything. Man it is so hard it is impossible. If anybody beat it tell me.
1,bad game,"the only thing you do in this game is shoot aliens that never seem to stop regenerating. It gets real boring, real fast. My advice, dont rent or buy this game. there are some cheats, but that still doesnt add fun. Hope this review is some use to you."
1,This game [is bad]wholly and truely,This game [is bad]. It is the worst game I have ever played. the point of the game is to shoot the choppy aliens with your green glowing balls before they shoot you with their red glowing balls of DEATH! Its a game that people should be executed over making. (or selling? :) ) So please for your sake DON'T BUY THIS GAME IT [IS BAD]!!!! Rent it first so you can agree with me.
3,Rent it before you buy it.,"... You've got 3 lives butyou have to against millions Alien, with all you coolweapons but can't kill them all. It's a fun shooting gameif you just want to shoot a round. Also, this game takes along time to load. Or is it just my PSII have this problem?My suggestion is rent it first."
5,I love her the best.,"This was my first album of Dalton's and the right words fail to describe the impact it has. The best female vocalist I've heard in a long time. Or, ever. There are moments on this album where, if you're not careful, you may faint from how beautiful she sounds. Her voice, in all it's raspy glory, will leave you drenched to the bone."
3,to complete the picture,"We know that this time,early '60s in NY was very productive,that everyone got their start there,some survived,some became famous,some comitted suicide etc etc. Karen Dalton was out there early and listening to her as she has songs speak through her you can hear the plaintive uncertainty of her life as it was unfolding....there she is on the back of the cd singing and playing with bob dylanand fred neil and then she fades from the radar while bob becomes bob and fred goes on.Her versions of fred neil and tim hardin songs sure take to a different place than the versions by the writers...much sadder,theres no joy here.I am glad that i bought this cd cuz it fills in some gaps in the history of that melting pot in ny.You cant help but feel sad for karen tho'"
1,OKAY FOR YESTERDAY,MOSTLY YESTERDAY'S NEWS AND OUT OF DATE. IT DOES HAVE PHOTOS OF PAST CHAMPS WHICH IS COOL. OKAY FOR A SELF APPOINTED HISTORY GOOF.
3,"looking for the timer funtion, but...","I found that the countdown timer only does certain preset times - 1,3,5,10,15,20,30 minutes. I needed a 14 and a 25 minute timer, neither of which are options. The watch was a nice size (I'm trying to replace a big clunky sports watch), but the timer function was not what I needed it to be."
2,Perhaps mine is just messed up...,"This watch works fine most of the time but if it gets even slightly moist, despite its label of ""WATER RESIST,"" it stops working. The screen blanks for up to a week before it begins to work again (and naturally I have to reset the time)."
5,Reliable,I have been purchasing Casio watches for many years. It is sometimes very difficult to find the older models. This was a great deal and my purchase arrived in good condition and on time. Would definitely purchase from this vendor again if the need arises.
4,Good watches. Love digitals!!!,"I have been using Casio Digitals since about 1990. I have 2 lithiums that Casio does not make anymore so wound up getting this one. The battery life is shorter on this watch since the battery is only 1.5 volts where lithium are 3 volts.Still I am so glad to be able to find a small, digital watch to use. Rarely use either alarm or timer so they are not that important to me.I have replaced the battery on my watch about 3 times and it is still working. The more dressy model does not work right after I changed the battery last time. It is a chance I take to do it myself.I did get inexpensive metal expansion bands for all my digital watches. The band will move to the new watch I order to replace the broken one so it is worth getting them.Don't rely on it being that waterproof so I am careful and have had no problems. I did get in a swimming pool with it on one time. I don't remember if it stopped or not. A few days of drying out and I am still using that watch."
4,Great watch,"This watch is great because the countdown is so easy to use. Whenever I need to remember to check the dryer or the stove, all I have to do is push one button to the number of minutes I want to wait. Its the only watch I wear and I never take it off. I even swim with it on. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is so plain. I wish Casio would make it in a pretty color."
4,It is What It Is,"The title says it all - it's a simple, black, rubber watch. No frills. It works. I like it."
5,Valuable for students & Delightful to read for anyone...,"This collection is valuable to the teachers in humanities classes, because it opens up their students' minds (hopefully) to the new and often previously completely unknown world of different cultures. Many best authors are chosen from each culture. All stories, without exception will bring something new to you as a reader, and the reading itself will be nothing but a sheer delight!!!! All stories will also make you think about your own culture and its values. Some stories will make you laugh, yet others will make you cry..."
2,GREAT GAME (NOT!),I guess this is a good game. Where you get to play bang bang with terminators but lets face it none of us can see in the dark and that's what the whole game isDARK DARK DARKIs it just me or is Infrogrames abssesed with the word Dark?Fun 3/10 I give it a three only because you get to kill Terminators.Graphics 4/10 Okay but I've seen some N64 games with betterEnemy AI 5/10 It's not that bad but they seem to think that just because they're picture's on the front cover they can walk into blaster fire and not die!lighting 0/10 the lighting is terrible and I'm not exagerating they don't even give ya a flashlight.As a summary I'd just like to say don't go buy this game unless you can see in the dark!
3,the camera holds this game back,"The game is really good and has a interesting story it fits perfectly to the original movie. The game play is mostly shooting with melee thrown in and feels like the resident evil games without the puzzles. The only problem with this game is the camera its terrible it does not fit well with the action heavy nature of this game, the camera gets annoying when your getting shot at in different direction and you have to adjust to the camera it can get fustrating especially in the last three or four levels. Its a good game pick this one up if you like the terminator movies just be ready to deal with the bad camera."
2,Worst game i've ever played,"This is the worst game i've ever played. First of all, the camera angles are distracting and annoying. They move every 5 seconds and makes the game harder to play. 2: Controls are confusing. X is shoot and you can't even move in first-person. and 3: Plot was quite boring. I can not say this is a fact because i only played it for 5 min and got annoyed by the game. If you can get past these flaws, this might be the game for you."
1,Incompatible,"My poor rating is for the following reason which has nothing to do with the quality of the program.I have been a big fan of K-9 since I first saw him in the Tom Baker era of Doctor Who. I was excited about buying this new series.However, the product description did not clearly state that it was not compatible with the North American format. It would not play on my Blu-Ray or DVD player and I had to return it for a refund. The refund was promptly made and if it is ever available in a format I can watch I would promptly buy it.Exterminate! Exterminate! :)"
2,"Good for Elderly, Bad for Everyone Else","This alarm clock seems to have been designed for elderly people who have difficulty seeing and hearing. First, the the clock is very large. I mean, it's greater than a foot long; you will have no trouble seeing what time it is from the other room (note to insomniacs: glow from eerie green numbers = more time staring at ceiling). Second, there are only two options for a wake up call: (1) the loudest buzzer ever constructed by humans; or (2) a radio that, admittedly, I have not tried (who uses that option anyway?). This clock is a real find for people losing their senses of sight and hearing, but for those of you with undiminished eyes and ears, you might want another clock in the interest of staying that way."
5,Great alarm clock,"I got this clock for my 7 year old son. It's was a good price, it's easy for him to use and works great!"
1,Don't buy this!!!,"I bought the clock and when it arrived the numbers would not light up, so I returned it for a new one. A few days later the new clock arrived and I could set the time or turn the radio off. I suggest you go with a brand name."
5,6 years later and still going strong,"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews this thing got. I purchased mine in late 2005 and it's still fully functional. You can adjust the volume of the radio alarm. I like that the numbers are large enough to read across the room without glasses. The analogue radio dial isn't particularly convenient, but since I wanted a clock, not a radio, it doesn't really matter."
5,flippin' awesome!!!,"Paul Alan is one of those few Christian artists who really gets what a walk with God is all about. His songs aren't these sugar coated ditties that talk about how wonderful your life will be if you walk with God. Instead he talks about lonliness, hopelessness, the pang of not knowing the one who you will spend the rest of your life with...but he does also speak of hope...so don't think it's a downer. He hits issues on the head with thoughtful, inspiring and creative lyrics. You're not going to hear lyrics that you can pour out of a can. No, he goes beyond conventional song writing. He's an amazing artist and it makes me so sad that more people do not know about this man. His songs will touch you in a way that other artists just never know how to do so. It's real, it's raw...it's wonderful. Just buy this cd...you'll be pleased beyond belief."
5,an outstanding artist!,Paul Alan is one of the most gifted christian artist that i have ever listened to.His songs rock and his voice is easy to listen to.
4,The Best Book to Get You Started With AdSense,"The first and only book I've ever bought about Adsense, Joel leaps right in from the first page to get your ad placement up and optimized with the minimum of fuss. He then goes on to explore all the tools related to AdSense and how to use them.I thought this book would be a difficult, page yawning slog but Joel manages to turn a potentially technical subject into easily comprehensible chapters with no padding. It's as straight to the point as it could possibly be. The concepts I learnt are still in the back of my mind every time I'm placing Adsense blocks on my website.I'm not sure how this book has dated since I bought it but I imagine all the chapters on Ad placement and design are still just as relevant as when the book was first published. Highly recommended."
5,BEST ADSENSE BOOK EVER!,I have read tons of books on online markting. Joel Comm has done an EXCELLENT job at putting together a real clear and well written guide on how to leverage AdSense.
5,Really good guide--easy to understand,I am not very computer savvy and this book is so well written and easy to understand. I appreciate learning what took him several years to learn. Excellent resource
2,Too much self-promotion,"I wrote a detailed criticism/ critique of this book, but it didn't get published...??? So here's my concise re-review: The authour spends far too much time plugging his own web sites and software than giving deep suggestions and information. This book may be ok for novices w/ AdSense: a few good tidbits here and there, but frankly, you can get far better, far more reliable and far more UNBIASED information from Google's AdSense homepage and the myriad blogs etc. on AdSense. I'm very suprised that the overall feedback for this book was as high as it is! Save yourself the money, go to the source at Google directly."
3,One Thumb Up,"This text was good in providing elementary facts of adsense. Most of the content is filler, though. It's published on cheap, thick paper. I implemented several things, though."
4,Great Title,"I had high hopes for this book and it did deliver some gems. But it was NOT enough inside info, especially for a book called the ""Adsense Code"".It is a pity because Joel is clearly a smart guy who knows the subject he is talking about nevertheless he shares just the tip of the iceberg with the reader."
4,got me started making money online,"This book got me started making money online. I had a small, hobby site and was looking for ways to make a few extra dollars with it. A friend gave me this book and it helped me do just that.Adsense has not made me rich, but it was a nice introduction to a new way of making money and, if nothing else, showed me that even I could do it too. From there, thanks to books likeQuit Your Job (and Never Go Back) - How to Create, Start, & Market an Online Business for Under $500 in 30 Days or Less, I have been able to expand on things and make more money. I am now reading more advanced material, not available, hoping to make even more money.If you are like me and already have a site, this book will help you make more money with it by posting Adsense ads. You may get rich or may not, but it's a start and you can expand to bigger and better things once you get it going."
3,Good One,"I think this is a good book for a beginner with adsense, or someone who has started with adsense and hasn't been getting good results.For an expert in adsense, you probably already know all the tricks the book will explain.My only complaint is that I think he needs to tone down the self promotion of his other books and products - which he does a lot in this book. It leaves you feeling cheated...kind of like when you go to a movie theater and watch ads before the previews of a movie."
4,"Lyrically deep, musically confusing","At first, it seemed a brilliant move to team the folk introspection of David Wilcox with the alt-rock attitude of Ric Hordinski (formerly of Over the Rhine). Unfortunately, Wilcox never completely sells on the rock numbers (stop holding back, man!), and Hordinski stumbles ever so slightly in his production of the slower acoustic numbers.Skipping the rock-experiment duds, the ballads on this album match or surpass anything else Wilcox has done. The pairing of ""Secret Church"" and ""Turning Point"" at the end of the album is breathtakingly beautiful.I would agree with some that this is not the best place to start for an intruduction to the artist, but neither do I think this album should be passed over because it experiments with non-traditional folk-rock production. You could do worse these days."
2,A disappointing departure for this serious Dave fan.,"I have all of Dave's stuff and have seen him many times live. This was a serious disappointment. His voice is much more suited to an acoustic treatment -- this electric guitar and harsh arrangements of this album overpower him. One of my very favorite songs, Your Kindness, is a particular letdown. Live, it is warm, intimate and special. Here, the poor quality of the recording distracts from the beauty of the song. Sorry, Dave. There are some high points (Waffle House, for example), but overall this album is not memorable. I still look forward to his next one though. Dave is one of the best singer/songwriters around."
2,Overproduced,"There are some decent songs here if you can make them out from under the overproduced mess that overshawdows the whole album. If you are looking for an introduction to Wilcox, stick with ""How Did You Find Me HEre"" or ""Home Again."""
1,Total Disappointment,"I purchased this book as research for a paper on genocide in the Congo, and quickly discovered there was hardly any information whatsoever - instead, each page is a photograph with one or two sentences underneath. What facts were given were strewn amongst run-on sentences, spelling errors, and horrific grammar.This book is filled with photographs of corpses, dismembered arms and legs, and so on. While this is a legitimate aspect of the mass murders that took place in the Congo, it would have been most helpful if the book had provided the information the title promised - the links between the genocide and President Clinton, the Paris Club, etc.I had no intention of purchasing a picture book - I could have read Time Magazine to obtain photographs and propaganda if I was after such drivel. The only reason I gave this book one star is no stars was not an option."
3,Still not there yet for engineers,I bought this book for one of my project and read most of its chapters. I feel that this book may be good for student in engineering major but sure not good enough for engineers.
5,Absolutely brilliant,"Yes, it's hard to believe that these 2 fellas can make such great music and sound so full in the process (they have some added horns on a few cuts, but more for atmospheric background than the usual dominant swells). I was immediately reminded of the Jam's best material when I first heard this album. Rod's voice and bass playing show a mastery of the art - great melodies and a nice pop/punk lilt. Out of their 3 releases, I think this one is by far the best. Now if we can just get them to tour the US!!"
5,WONDERFUL,"I've tried other ""biodegradable"" laundry detergents with mixed results. This cleans as well as Tide & is environmentally friendly... Our clothes always smell fresh.Also great for people with sensitive skin. We switched to the ""cheaper stuff"" for a few loads...my 5 y/o daughter broke out in hives and was frantically itching...I hope this stays on the market for a long time... I love the smaller bottle... my laundry room is small & this doesn't take up a lot of space, yet does a lot of loads... Great product!"
1,Horrible,"This product actually makes my laundry stink, like if it was sitting around wet for days!! It's horrible, and when I contacted the customer department they could do nothing for me. Now I use ECOVER Laundry, and I love it!!!"
4,If you're a Foo Fighters fan check out Gloritone !,"This cd hits the ground running with the catchy track ""Halfway"" with edgy vocals that echo the intensity of Dave Grohl. The pace of the cd doesn't let up much so if you prefer the lighter side of alterna-rock you should skip ahead to the ""Never Not"" track it's more of a lazy day at the beach kind of a song or ""She Was A Good Thing"". This cd has a little bit of something for everyone.It's great for driving in the car, running in the park and when you have to do chores it makes them a bit more fun.Check it out for yourself!"
3,Good Altern-Rock,"The problem with any music trend is that there tends to be too much product - bad stuff gets popular whereas better stuff gets ignored. Gloritone won't win any originality awards with this album, but it's quite well done. Tim sings with conviction about...well, whatever it is he's singing about. Fave track - ""Last Rites From the Coffee Table"". See them at a 800-seat venue near you."
4,A different perspective on APT,"As a collie lover and owner, and one who grew up with the memorable books by APT, I couldn't wait to read this biography. It shows the flaws as well as the good points of the man, how he acquired Sunnybank, how he became the writer we know."
3,Disappointing,"I was horribly disappointed in this book, as I expected photos of all the collies and The Place as well as of APT and the Mistress. What very few photos there were, were horrible reproductions that could not have been worse if I had done them at home on an 80 year old copier. If you want to see what the place and the dogs looked like, skip spending the money on this book. From a purely biographical point of view, the book is OK."
1,Expected something else...,"Very disappointing. I expected background character music for Sesshomaru from the series, but this was something different and far inferior..."
4,Nice game,The purchase was great the vendor sold item as displayed very happy with purchase will buy other items from this vendor in the future.
4,I use its countdown alarm nearly every day,"I've had a succession of these watches for over 25 years and use the countdown alarm all the time - especially at work. With a few button pushes I can set an alarm for 1-3-5-10-15-20 or 30 minutes. As a nurse multitasking in a hospital, I set the alarm to remind me to pick up on a task I've set aside while I work on something else.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's designed for use, not aesthetics. A coworker recently said, ""The 80s called and want their watch back."" However, when this one wears out, I'll be getting another one nonetheless. Also, Casio, if you're listening, add an illuminator function to this watch! Then it would be near perfect."
4,Only one of its kind,"Why is it that no one except Casio makes digital watches for women? This is the only watch that I wear. It has a timer and an alarm - everything I need. It is affordable and reliable, but I end up buying a new one about every 5 years."
5,Looks nice and so much functionality!,"I love this watch. It provides a timer, alarm, and an easy to read digital display, and is nice enough to wear to work. I don't know of any other women's watch that provides this functionality but looks nice. I have one in gold and one in silver."
5,Terrific buy!,Previously owned this model watch - was very glad to find it again. Excellent quality and battery life.
4,pleased with watch,"My daughter is a ""digital"" person and had some trouble finding a nice looking watch. Most are plastic sports watches. This is attractive."
3,"good watch, lousy band","The watch is fine, or, rather, the watch WAS fine. The band opened up once too many times, and I lost the watch. Next time I'll buy the watch and replace the band with an expansion band."
3,Falls a Little Short,"I have bought the Casio sports watch (the original black one with the black plastic band) for years and years. It is a work horse and the band falls apart way before the watch does. I love that watch! I use the alarm constantly. So when I saw this silver one with a better band, I thought great, and I gave it a try. Although it has all the same functions, I was very disappointed because I can't hear the sounds. The main reason I loved this style watch was because I use the one to thirty minute time clock on a regular basis. But on this new watch I can't hear the alarm. It is so soft. And I have good hearing. So basically the reason I love this style watch is useless with this one because I can't use the alarm. Unless I have a reject and don't know it, I wouldn't buy this if you are counting on the alarm part. The band is OK. And it's nice to have a different look from the black one, but it's back to the old for me. Too bad too."
3,not so good,it doesn't look so great...only good part is the alarm...It is very useful for me...that is the only reason I opted for it
5,Great ladies digital watch,This digital watch is a nice ladies' size and comes with an alarm. It is easy to set. The band can be adjusted easily. I would recommend this watch to others.
4,Really good read considering it's a textbook,"This was assigned in my film history class; but I plan to read the whole thing again later, because it is not only informative but it's also a very good read. It's well organized and puts together a cohesive look at how films go together. I don't give it full marks because it does have the usual murky areas and overly textbook-ish spots. It's also way overpriced for something that isn't available new and yet is not a 'vintage' book."
2,"Boring, long winded, not worth the money","I am very sorry I bought this book. I was looking for ""an introduction"" as this book states it is. Instead, I got a film textbook that is very boring. I couldn't get through the first chapter without getting glazed over. I should mention that I am not a serious film student, just someone interested in film and the history of cinema and film making. This book has done nothing but collect dust on my bookshelf."
3,"a little motivation, a little density, a little blah","I picked this book up to try to remotivate me for a summer ride - I figured I'd read it in a few quick sittings.Two months later, I'm still ambling through it. I enjoy Moore's clever turns of phrase enough to stare at the page and parse each sentence, but I'm not engrossed enough in any one chapter to hurry to finish it that night.I wouldn't hurry to pick up his next book, but if you're a touring cyclist, it's not so bad. I'll just use images of Lance at Luz-Ardiden to motivate instead."
2,A waste,"I want my time AND money back. Too late, I know, but that's just how I felt after looking through it."
2,"Promising prologue, peleton failed.","Just like the author I have always wanted to ride the tour de france route (and ideally away from the eyes of others) so this book really appealed to me. The first part of the book was excellent - funny and engaging. Unfortunately as the journey began and the days passed the storyline really dragged and became very boring. Maybe is just isn't a great storyline afterall. Too bad, I thought I could live my fantasy through this book."
2,Whining one's way through the Tour de France,"While a light and overall enjoyable read, there's rather too much of the age-old English ambivalence, if not outright antipathy, towards everything French. It's amusing at first, but a little goes a long way -- in this case all the way to the end of the book. One begins to wonder if the author really enjoyed this epic ride, or if it wasn't overshadowed by an endless parade of disagreeable people and situations encountered at every stage. A bit more elation, a bit less suffering, would have made for a better read."
1,Whinging Pom,"What a miserable read - all the author did was whinge and moan about the french, the countryside, cycling and the food. I know Bill Bryson can offer his share of complaints in his travel books but at least his are tinged with humor.Tim Moore is just miserable throughout.He gets disgusted when a french town is not pretty and then disgusted when it is. He hates cycling the mountains but gets bored on the flat stretches. He gets drunk at lunchtime and drunk again in the evenings. What a bore.The only redeeming feature was the bits of history about the Tour that are interspersed throughout.I don't think I'll even finish it."
1,Fair Warning,"Okay, okay, how do I say this nicely? This book is all but unreadable. Period. But not for the reason(s) you might think. The author is British. I am a not, and frankly, half the time while toiling through this book, I didn't have a clue as to what this writer was talking about. You see, that's because the book is written a la ""British humor"". British humor combined with late 20th century British slang terms, references, in-country gossip, yada, yada,yada. It's a book written by a Y2K Brit for fellow Y2K Brits. While his stories of previous Tour races are interesting and well written, so much of the rest of the book, like I said before, had me more than once thinking, ""What is this guy talking about??""All you Anglophiles can turn up your noses if you wish, but I personally would not recommend this book. I am sorry I bought it; even used, it was not worth it."
2,Entertaining but with caution,"Tim Moore writes an good commentary of touring France on his trusty bicyclette. His descriptions are witty and humourous, he makes light of what could have been a pretty tiresome experience. Moore's insights in to Tour de France history are well researched. A good book for anyone interested in knowing the ""true"" no-glamour France. One word of caution - it is disappointing for a writer who is focusing on somewhat of a fun event in his life, riding a bike around france - that Moore uses so many out of context explatives and blasphemies. After all this is not a story about pedalling drugs in the criminal underworld. For a writer who musters up good descriptive imagery, to at times drop in the ""F-bomb"" and Blasphemies shows how hard Moore must have been flipping through a Theasurus to look impressive as a writer. Swear words do not sell more books, they do not add value to the reading experience, they infact cheapen it."
3,velo fellow,"The book's an enjoyable read, if a bit implausible at first, when the author claims such total ignorance of everything cycling, yet plans a 2000 mile trip. The style reminded me of Bill Bryson, though not reported with Bryson's ultra-sharp eye. I thought it was a fair mix of reportage and humor and once the narrative got past the 'I'm such an ill-prepared novice' confessional was an engaging read with some good historical research. By the way, Tim, the English champion was Percy Stallard, not Stannard."
4,A Funny Story of a Tough Ride,"Tim Moore has decided to ride the route of the Tour de France. The only problem is he isn't ready to do it. Not even close -- by his own admission.Hoping that he'll ride himself into shape, the story that follows is the funny (because it's true) tale of an average guy taking on one of sport's toughest challenges. In his travels, Moore is ridiculed by club riders, freezes in the rain on France's giant cols, and is walked in on, half naked, by the woman who runs an inn where he's staying, among many other misadventures.This book is very funny, probably funnier than I think it is because it's written in the Queen's English -- which is sometimes harder to decipher than French -- instead of American English."
4,Engaging travelogue-torture test,"I think Tim Moore is a very funny writer, and this book is quite engaging, and thoroughly enjoyable. Mr. Moore takes it upon himself to follow the exact 2000 Tour de France route. Much hilarity ensues. As a fellow cyclist, I'm deeply impressed by his ability to climb the fearsome cols of Galibier and Ventoux; I suspect he wasn't as ill-trained as he claims. That aside, the history of the Tour de France is covered quite well here, along with rotten hotel rooms, excruciating pain, abdominal mishaps, and frank surprise at his ability to finish the route. I give this four stars only because I think his ""Travels with a Donkey"" is superior. This is a fun read for anyone with a passing interest in cycling, road racing, and France."
5,"Moving and powerful, a true work of art!!!",A fantastic read! I couldn't put it down. House has really broken ground with this dark comedy. Little Danny Burke has captured my heart as did his band of misfit school mates. I haven't seen a more colorful cast of children since the Peanuts gang. Liz Kaigh and Carol Burke are laugh out loud perfect. I will be looking for Tom House's next work. What a great movie this would Be. Bravo to House!
5,"Great Book! Intelligent, insightful and fun to read!",This book provides wonderful insight into the dynamics of male/female relationships.
1,Sorry Rick...,"This game sucks. Also, if you haven't seen the movie ""Rise of the Machines"", it sucks, too. Well...maybe not to Rick from Indiana who, incidentally, doesn't get out too much."
5,Cool but in my opinion its a bit hard,"It has a great storyline,awesome weapons,but its a bit hard for me,i havent played it though but theyre saying it is challenging and i cant beat not one challenging game without invincibility which this game doesnt have. But the rest is great great great."
2,VERY ANNOYING GAME!!!!,"I bought this stupid game because I liked the Terminator a lot. When I was playing this game, I noticed two things wrong with it....... CAMERA VIEW & GRAPHICS!!!!!! Every time you go to a different area in the game, the camera view changes!!!!!! It is soooooooooo annoying!!! Also, this makes it very hard to find out where you are going. The graphics in the game are teeeerible!!!! They look like playstation 1 graphics! Right now, I'm on the last level (which isn't very hard to get to because there's only 10 levels) and I can't beat it because my objectives won't tell me what to do!! Now I'll probably NEVER beat this stupid game!!!!! The only thing good about this is the 8th level because tou actually battle a terminator. Other than that, this game is a complete waste of time."
4,Gotta waste the fakies...,"I think this game has probably one of the best storylines of any game i have played so far...Also one of the most seemlessly knit games i ever came across, an enthralling, thoroughly engrossing game with tons of action and with more twists and curves to keep any game fan GLUED to the television for hours at a time.Absolutely the best game I have played so far (if not THE best)"
3,A Little Better Than OK.,"This wasn't a bad game. It was pretty hard in some spots, but generally only took about an hour or less per mission. Hard part is unlocking the cheats and extras, which I wasn't able to do. Earning medals is pretty tough unless your playing through the mission for the tenth time."
1,Incredibly Disappointing,"I can't believe I just blew [alot of money]on this. Terrible game. Like so many games with big movie titles, they just use the title to sell the game.They put no effort into making a good game....Very disorienting,..."
2,Where Was(Not Was)?,"Excellent movie, but this soundtrack falls short without the superb ""Hello Dad...I'm In Jail""!"
1,Missing a song.,"Okay it's not really missing the song, but it not the right version of the song... I ordered this cd for the ""Kick out the jams"" and ""Everybody Knows"" songs from the movie. However the version of Everybody Knows on this CD isn't the one from the movie, it's a bad cover of it by some other band."
2,Missing tracks,"As others have already commented on, a lot of music is missing from this sound track. Major disappointment to find Leonard Cohen omitted. Here are some tracks you can hunt for...Decendants - Wienerschnitzel, from the album: SomeryLeonard Cohen - Everybody Knows, from the album: I'm The ManLeonard Cohen - If it be your will, from the album: Various Positions"
4,"Loads of energy, near miss","Ok, first, the chorus. Leonard Cohen had two freakin great songs in the movie, and all the soundtrack has is a weak commercialzed cover of one. The whole tone of the movie was set by the original ""Everybody Knows"" and the soundtrack has the cover version that played during the car chase. Did the person who selected the songs for the soundtrack even watch the movie?That aside. Part of the movie was alternative music, and not alternative like we mean it now, which is to say, pop. Alternative in those days meant ""no airplay, no album sales"". The movie dug into that genre of music and found stuff we all know about now, and stuff that wanted to be that stuff. Some of the bands became big on their own terms eventually, and some of them became nothing, but at least they weren't the plastic studio manufactured crap that passes for ""alternative"" music now."
5,James Davis Sr,"Listening to Pump up the volume, reminds me of watching the movie. It has brought back plenty of memories of my high school years, I love it. thank you."
2,You don't have to pump this one too loud,"Mediocre 90's collection tries to be all things to all people but fails being much to anyone simply because most of the material has worn away or the songwriting wasn't there to begin with. A few exceptions to this rule hardly justify a purchase, I'm sure these tracks can be found elsewhere."
4,Great Compilation Can Be Made Better,"First off, this soundtrack compilation is worth owning. Chagall Guevera's Tale O' The Twister, for example, is difficult to come by. The rest of the songs are excellent alternative music and represent the spirit of the film well. But as everyone has pointed out, there are some crucial omissions.To fix the problems with it will require mixing additional tracks on your CD burner. I added ""Everybody Knows"" and ""If It Be Your Will"" by Leonard Cohen, ""Love Comes In Spurts"" by Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and ""Hello Dad.., I'm in Jail"" by Was (Not Was) and now have a five star collection. Leagal downloads should run about $4 or so. You'll be much happier afterwards, I promise."
2,no leonard cohen,"Forgettable soundtrack, with the exception of Concrete Blonde's cover of ""Everybody Knows"" [which is for some reason included here, even though Cohen's version was the only one used in the movie, as far as i can remember], and a different mix of the Pixies' ""Wave of Mutilation""."
5,"2,000 years in the making, and it was groovy!",This book tells you many things about the greeks! Now i relly want to buy the other books in the seris.......... The Angry Aztecs The Awesome Egypitains THe Blitzed Brits The cut-thoat Celts The First World War The Gorgeous Geogians The Rotten Romans The Savage Stone Age The Slimy Stuarts The Smashing Saxons The Terrible Tuders Even MORE Terrible Tuders The Vicous Vikings The Vile Victoriens The Woefull Second World WarI hope all of these are as good as these books! It makes historey fun( History was always my favorite subject)!
3,windsor Jr High - Nat,This was a good book. I realy liked the part where the lady was writing in her journal. I also liked the facts about the greeks and other places around it. Some of the things I didnt like where when it would tell in depth how to do things. Over all it was a good book.
5,wish all my history lessons were as funny,"the absolutely hysterical illustrations caught my eye at first(martin brown- I'm a huge fan now!) . then I started reading it and I was hooked by the great style in which it introduces the basic history. humorless people that expect a serious historical textbook need not bother- this hilarious series just gives you an outline of the period. I also recommend the ""terrible tudors"". I loved it!"
4,groovical!,"This book was so good. All the other history books I've read are really boring, and usually I'm not interested in the Ancient Greeks. I've got this book and my favourite part was the seige of Troy! Terry Deary is one of my favourite authors and he and Martin Brown make the best history books ever! It's really funny and easy to understand. The Ancient Gods of Greece were really ""gruesome gods""! This book made me want to learn more about the Groovy Greeks. So I was very happy when we were learning about it at school. I was pleased to say that I knew lots of this stuff because I had read it all in the Groovy Greeks. I lent my book to My teacher and she really liked it too. I don't know who wouldn't! Well, I would recommend it to anyone! I want to read more Horrible Histories now!"
2,"Templates, Templates, Templates!","My neighbor had purchased the first book in the series called, Once Around the Block, so I thought I would get the second book. I had read a review stating that the third book would not be for beginners, since I am a fairly new quilter, I thought the second book would be okay. However, I missed the fact that the majority of the blocks require templates! I hate templates. They are so time consuming compared to just rotary cutting everything. The templates I have used aren't even standard measurements on a quilter's ruler either so strip cutting doesn't work--less than a eighth inch increments.The blocks are more unique than in the first book but I would not make a large quilt using these blocks!"
1,"Templates, Yuck!","I own all three of these books in the series but I never, never use this one. It requires that you use templates for almost ALL patterns. I surely would not have bought this book if I had known."
4,excellent for a variety of sizes,"my quilt group chose an unusual size for a block exchange andJudy's book helped me make these squares. Yes, she is using templatesbut when enlarging or reducing pattern sizes, it is going to enable oneto make the desired block without drafting it yourself. while not abook for an absolute beginner, it has many different traditional blocksand the variety of sizes are the real draw."
4,Here is the man that sings storys of the old west,Marty Robbins is on of my favorite singers.You can see the songs telling the story of the old west as you listen.Great songs from a Great Singer of Ballads and trail Music.Shopping from home does not get any better than this.Thanks Amazon PrimeM.A.FLICK
3,Getting old...is obvious,"I bought this DVD because of the positive reviews; I am not as happy with it as the others. It is clear that all them show signs of aging and a loss in their talent; however, considering they have been at the top of the musician's world, a loss in them still leaves them with plenty of musicianship to be admired. Greg Lake's voice is still admirable, though his highest range is gone; Keith Emerson's precision and mastership is not as crisp, though his flare, theatrically (and perhaps narcissism) still shines; Karl Palmer still displays the strength, power and coordination to put on a drum solo which many twenty somethings could envy. Watching this DVD is more a satisfaction of nostalgia than a true enjoyment and experience of awe they provided years past. If we can all age this gracefully then, bring it on!!"
5,Emerson Lake & Palmer - 40th Anniversary Reunion Concert (BD),"I very like the Band since I was 14... now I'm 51. I will not comment about the show.I had the pleasure to see them at concert in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 1993.The picture of this BD was excellent, but I can't say the same about the sound.It was so poor. I believe that the 40th anniversary should be commemoratewith all the best that one BD technology could give to us, their eternal fans."
1,The worst Blu-ray Dvd,The worst blu-ray DVD in my collection.I loved those guys from their very first album and watched them at concert many years ago.This show is pathetic and audio sounds like crap.I wish I could send it back to the Amazon store.
1,Blu-ray Review,"Really NOT sure what concert those that rave about this one are watching/hearing. First of all, I only listen to the 5.1 versions; would NOT own any concerts if I listened to stereo only. The picture quality is not too bad, BUT it's the audio I have problems with. First, why not use Dolby TrueHD? A band such as ELP should have demanded it! In a way, not using the BEST quality audio was a blessing! The CROWD NOISE RUINED this show!!!!! These guys were meant to be enjoyed with NO outside noise. It's the WORSE BD I own; I would have given it zero stars if possible! I'll give it away to someone and even then I would feel as though I'm screwing them! SAVE your money for something good; there are many others out there that are good. And YES, I'm one that has been spoiled by the excellence of Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson; FIRST CLASS!"
1,Old Fat and Crap,"Terrible - hideous - worst BluRay I own - they are milking the last few bucks out of our fond memories of what greatness WAS.Vocals - like listening to Whitney Houston 2110 - musicianship GONE.Take everything you were afraid it might be and triple it.Do you really want to be a ""LUCKY MAN""?Do NOT buy this - now you are LUCKYFor those that asked - YES the picture and sound quality are very good - you can see and hear everything which makes it even WORSE"
1,Terrible Performance,"The quality of the video and sound on this is EXCELLENT, unfortunatley the performance was an absolute disaster. They were not tight at all - as if they hadn't even prepared for the show. Emerson's playing was especially sloppy and off time often. Palmer's playing was decent, and his usual flamboyant solo was up to par, but missing ques in the compositions due to the sloppiness of Emerson. Lake wasn't even trying to hit notes higher than middle C. I was very disappointed with this DVD, but now that I've seen it I don't feel so bad about my decision not to travel to the UK to see this show at the time which I had been tempted to do."
4,I wish I had been there!,"For those dyed-in-the-wool ELP fans like me, this is one for the collection. Having seen them many many times throughout their incredible career, in their many incarnations ( e.g. ELPowell,3,Emerson-Lake 2 months prior to this show),I wish I had been there to see this one; for I believe this one-off reunion concert is also their SWAN SONG. Having only a couple of weeks to rehearse and get back in the groove again painfully shows here. There are missteps, missing notes,equipment malfunctions and a classic that's played an octave lower than it should have been. Having said that, the concert overall is worthy of a place in any ELP fans' collection. Just don't play ""Isle of Wight"", ""Cal Jam"" or ""Live in Montreaux '98"", then this one.If you do, have tissues handy...."
2,Going Through The Motions,"I agree with Bernardo's review with every point that is made. I love these guys. I was always in awe of their musicianship and ""tightness"". This concert is almost like they are just going through the motions. The miscues and lack of cohesion is disappointing. Granted...these songs are not a piece of cake and demand great musical strength and dexterity. Carl really needs to keep his shirt on at this stage (reminded me very much of Paulie ""Walnuts"" Gualtieri from the Sopranos)....Greg's vocal and intonation sounds fine......Keith is the master but sometimes I feel he is overplaying the set and struggles to get all the notes in. I thought the sound and video on the Blu-Ray were great! The performance is another story. Simply put, this is not the best representation of ELP. Better off going with The Royal Albert Hall show."
5,A MUST FOR ELP FANS,they probably played for the last time together in this show.. the only disapointment is that it's only about an hour.
1,Bad Performance,"I'm a huge ELP and Progressive Rock fan, but how anyone who views this video can claim it's anything but utter garbage, I don't understand. I bought this blu-ray DVD at Best Buy, very excited to view it. To my dismay, I couldn't even get through the first song. Keith Emerson CANNOT PLAY anymore. He was awful. Carl Palmer was OK but Greg Lake (he looks as big as a lake, lake Michigan) wasn't as bad as Keith, but that's not saying much. If you love this band DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. It will only diminish your memory of this once great band."
2,Review of Budget BuckyTM Skeleton (4th Quality),"Although I expected the product, being 4th quality, to have minor defects, there were numerous defects, including a defective fitting of a thigh bone into the pelvic bone. It was an effort simply to position the skeleton in a sitting position on a bench."
4,Bucky Review,"4th quality Bucky's are just that - 4th quality.Broken ribs, in pieces, etc.So, a little pricey - but acceptable for my Halloween purposes.....dancing skeleton ghosts!"
4,Appear to be fine.,I have only started using the first bag in this set. They seem to be as advertised. They feel pretty much like the Hoover replacement bags I buy at the hardware store. The price was excellent for these. I am not seeing any leaks or issues with them.
4,Type Y Vacuum Bags,"Bags fit fine, no problem. Vacuum seemed to have extra vacuum power with these bags. Felt a little more resistance to forward motion, which I am guessing is the extra vacuum suction. Possible cleaning carpets better. Since the operation seemed a little different, only gave them a four star rating."
3,Much thinner then the original,These bags seem to work fine. Since they are so much thinner then the others I would guess they don't filter as much as the other bag.
5,The vacuum sucks,"And appropriately, these are dirt bags. But these are what I needed, and these were a great price and OEM quality."
3,Not like original bag,"I have not used this bag yet, but I can tell you it looks NOTHING like the original bag that comes with the Hoover vacuum. It is paper versus what appears to be cloth. It is much smaller. It may still be a good deal, given the price difference, but it is not ""comparable"" in my mind. It would be nice if Amazon paired up the vacuums with the bags for easy selection, too. I found that very confusing when ordering as all sorts of different bags and other accessories came up when searching."
3,Great price!,"I love the price on these. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is supposed to be 18 bags, 2 bags of 9. I only received 1 bag of 9. Amazon was great on fixing the problem though. I was given the option of either half of my money back or to return the 9 bags at Amazon's expense and have a new set sent out.As I needed the bag soon, I opted for my money back but will be ordering again.The price can't be beat! I paid around $8 for 3 bags at Best Buy when I purchased my vacuum."
5,lots of the money,compared prices & this was alot of bags for the money-would recommend buying from Amazon!
1,Not like the original Hoover bag that came with my vacuum,"These bags are not the same as the original bag that came in my new Hoover vacuum.I received my Hoover vacuum yesterday and if you look inside and see the bag, it is quite nice, and these bags are clearly not the same.I want to find the exact same hoover bag that came with my vacuum.It says part # 902419001 but nowhere on amazon do I see this part number.These bags are paper and the original bag that comes with the vacuum have more of a cloth feel. They are available on the hoover website.As for the shipping, my item was delivered from Ontrac which I have not had good luck with. It was a day late and they misdelivered a package in dec."
4,quick delivery,I haven't had to use a new bag yet but it came right away! 4 stars for the shipment... I can't say 5stars yet since I haven't tried the actual product.
3,ok for the money,"These bags are OK for the money. They are not the same quality as OEM bags, but work just fine at less than half the price. I will probably buy them again."
5,Great,Was and am pleasantly happy with a vacuum that requires bags.I have a small townhouse and these bags are easy to apply and strong.
4,"Light, easy to use, good carpet cleaning","Light, easy to use, good carpet cleaning, very good value for moneyDoes spread and throw around dust, on hard woodFor us, its OK as house is mainly carpeted. So highly recommneded for carpetted home."
5,Great bags,Been using them for years in my Hoover. Great price for the amount of bags. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
5,Good bags,Bags arrived on time and fit in my vacuum. I would recommend getting these instead of other bags if you have the need for them.
5,Thwy work fine,They fit my type Y vac and work just fine.I received the bags pictured so no issues there.The seller also sent me an email a couple weeks after I got them to make sure I was happy with my purchase.
5,good product,"This vacuum is excellent in every way. It is very effective, reasonably quiet and easy to manipulate. I like the signal light, clearly visible, that lets you detect areas where there is a good deal of embedded dirt. The light goes red and only returns to green when the area is clean. Useful data."
2,Not What I Expected!,The bags were very thin and more like paper rather than a filter-type bag. It may be alright for those who are not particular on how well made a vacuum bag should be but I firmly believe unless the quality is there then it will not properly filter out dust-mites at 98%. I sent them back and ordered from Hoover and the bags were much heavier and more like a cloth.
4,Hoover WindTunnel Vacuum Bags Review,"These bags are awesome. They are very durable and stretchy. Because they are stretchy, they do not explode as quick. It is fairly big so it can hold particles for a longer time. I bought 3 packs of this since it is very good. I would recommend this product to others who are looking for a strong and durable vacuum bag."
4,Hoover Widepath Vacuum,"Like it--suction great. Convenient features like ability to turn off brush would be nice, but low price is nicer"
3,Poor service,Quite satisfied with the product. These were extra bags for the Hoover Vacuum cleaner. I did not have an immediate use for them. It took a LONG time to receive them. I give four star for the item but the service could hardly get two star. I settle with an overall three star.
3,Bags are okay,Have not been able to use the product yet. The vacuum cleaner I bought from Amazon had problems. The bags look alright though.
1,Caution: E-mail vendor FIRST before buying,"I just received these bags, but the brand was NOT Envirocare as advertised -- it was Crucial Vacuum, a cheap Chinese knock-off (of a generic!). I've been having this problem with vacuum parts through Amazon where vendors ship out much cheaper, inferior parts than what's pictured and hope that most people don't complain. Amazon is not doing an adequate job of keeping tabs on these vendors, and they are making a mint off of these cheap, inferior bags.I e-mailed the vendor to complain and they are sending out the correct brand, but really, why should I have to do that? If this happens to you, please complain to Amazon as well -- it's their responsibility to screen out vendors, especially when they rotate vendors through as the primary supplier (so feedback left for one may be attributed to another)."
