3,Terrific lens,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this little lens? Works great for the money. The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that the I'm on my second one because after a year and a half the first one started to give me read errors with my Canon 40D. Because I had it for over a year (1 1/2 years), Canon told me I was on my own and would not repair it for free. Tamron, on the other hand gives you a 6 year warranty! But besides that, it really does take great photos, sharp and crisp and great bokah at 1.8. Thats why I bought a second copy of it. Hopefully I'll get a little more time out of this one."
5,Great lens for the price!,"Every now and again you see people complain about the lens feeling cheap and being afraid it will break. I have had two of these lenses (the first one was stolen) and unless i suddenly have hundreds of dollars lying around i will always buy the canon 1.8 II. It has worked very well for me for the past few yeas. If you are on a budget but want a lens that will shoot good portraits in most lighting situations get this lens.One CON would be the auto focus isnt perfect, it occasionally wont focus right or takes a little longer than i like. But like i said, you can buy a lens for 3-4x its price, or put up with occasionally annoyance of non-focus."
4,Very pleasantly surprised,"The bad stuff first, it's made of plastic and I can believe everything the other reviewers say about it's fragility. Definitely handle with care. But wow, who would have known so little money could get you such a quality lens. It's really a specialty lens for close ups and portraits, not what I would consider a walk around lens. I am amazed at the sharpness and detail this little lens puts out. At 1.8f it creates some awesome clarity, bokeh, refined detail. Perfect for intimate shots but also can be handy for wide angle use too, just not very versatile and certainly not my first choice. Unfortunately it has no image stabilization so a tripod is a must to get the most out of it. Auto focus is loud but reasonably fast. A great value, fantastic pictures, and a must for any photographer's lens collection."
5,"Sharp and fast, and Cheap!","So cheap it's insane. Build is lame but light so it makes you feel like you are not carrying a lens at all. In fact, on a smaller bodied SLR it makes for a very nice little combination. This lens is a must have ion your quiver, especially if you let anyone else use your camera. If you can afford to buy the 1.4 go for it, but then get one of these too as it is pretty much a disposable and incredibly fast, clear, and precise lens. I love it in low light applications."
4,Amazing Lens for the Price Point,This should be every beginner photographer's first lens purchase. It works well as a portrait lens and for taking candid shots of your family and friends.Do note that the exterior of the lens is plastic. Canon had to cut a few corners to get this lens down to this price. It feels and looks a bit cheap but the glass is what counts. The AF servo is also slow and really loud. I was surprised at how loud it was the first time I used it. I tend to use the manual focus a bit more than I would with other lens due to this.If you have the money I'd recommend buying the EF 50mm f/1.4 II for the better build quality. [Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras]
5,Just what I was looking for!,"For a little over $100 the 50 1.8 is a steal of a deal. Good images, good color and only $100! I definitely recommend it for anybody who is just starting out and is not sure where to start when it comes from lenses."
4,"Great lens, very reasonably priced","I've taken some great pictures with this lens. But the most attractive attribute is its low price. The quality of the materials in this lens are on the cheap side, but as long as the lens functions well, it doesn't bother me!"
4,Great Lens For The Price,"I purchased this lens for low light shooting and shallow DOF. The lens works great for these types of pictures. It has a less than ideal AF, but once you shoot with it a bit you will love the lens."
5,Must have lens!,"This Canon lens is a must have for any beginning or more serious amateur photographer. While not quite as fast as the 50mm F 1.4 or the incredible 50mm F 1.2L, it is a fast lens for less than $100. This will allow you to shoot in low light conditions without flash and get great results. Being less than $100 and being an EF lens means that you can buy it and use it forever, even if you move up to a full frame camera like the 5D. I would highly recommend this lens."
5,Love it,"I love this lens, it does great for portraits and I use it when my kids are playing around in the yard too. Its super fast and sharp. Produces nice bokeh if wanted!!"
5,A Great Little Lens,"I love this lens! I purchased it even with mixed reviews on many different sites! I think it's a great beginner lens. I don't feel as if it is too cheaply made, but you do have to be careful of it. I have seen a difference in the photos I have taken with this lens and my lenses that were purchased with my canon 30mm slr."
5,Awesome lens. Can't go wrong with this nice piece of glass.,"Great lens and for under $100 you can't go wrong. Obviously it's not ""L"" glass but this thing takes some sharp, well exposed images. Get one for your camera now."
4,Happy So Far,"Lightweight, good clarity and color. Price was right, too. Not happy with how Amazon shipped it though. It was in its own little flimsy box inside a bigger box with a deflated plastic pillow so had no cushioning at all. Fortunately, wasn't damaged. Read another review of a camera that was sent the same way. So keep this in mind if you're ordering anything delicate from Amazon."
3,"Cant beat the price, you get what you pay for though.","Nice cheap lens, but as every other review has mentioned, its loud as crap and very very cheaply made. The glass is good and it takes some very nice portraits, but dont be upset if it falls apart after a few months of normal use."
5,Awesome,"Service was great, lens came as described and before scheduled date. I tested it and worked perfectly.Worth the price."
1,NOISY. Slow.,"Pros: CHEAP... f/1.8 is great for bokeh/depth of field effects.Cons: Don't expect to shoot anything quietly, or quickly with this lens. The autofocus is nearly useless. It is so slow, noisy, and at times inaccurate that you're better off keeping it on manual. Also, 50mm on a cropped sensor is really an 85mm lens, putting you uncomfortably close to friends and other subjects.Personally, I think this is a waste of money. I purchased the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 EX DC HSM Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras for $450 or so and it has been worth every penny. It provides a wide enough angle, with a super-wide aperture, and a fast focusing motor."
4,good price for a decent quality lens,"seems to be too light and cheap looking , but quality is great for a f1.8 lens. The only disturbing is that the lens makes disturbing noise as the AF fails to focus"
5,Canon Lens,"This lens if perfect for taking details picture without the huge cost. Though it does have a cheap feel to it, the lens get the job done, I have used this lens for a wedding;taking detail pics up close of flowers, food, and jewelery and the picture came out pretty good. For this price, you can't find another lens that does the job of this lens!1"
4,What? It's $40 more than when I originally bought it 3 years ago!!!,"So I have had a ball with this lens. I just love taking portraits of kids, family, friends, etc. I love the low light capabilities. Unfortunately, 3 years later, the lens just snaps into two pieces. I suppose that's what I get for a $76.00 plastic lens. SO I said no biggie, I'll go buy a new one on amazon. I was shocked to see that the price has been raised over $40. I know it's not just amazon either. Doing it all over again, I don't think I can rightfully purchase this lens again from Canon. Just to let you all know that they raised the price on the 1.4 from $314 three years ago to $399!"
5,love it!!!,"This is a must have lens in ur camera bag. As soon as I took the first picture, I was very impressed.The photos are sharp and very detailed. The built quality is not that great, but just watch out for the ""drunk marmots"" so you don't have any problems. ;)I would advice anyone buying this lens to buy it at your local store. I bought mine from Bestbuy and I had to go there twice to exchange the lens, because the autofocus motor wasn't working. I exchanged it twice and both lens has problems. So, keep it simple and fast, get it from the local store."
4,Take into consideration the crop factor,"This is actually my first prime lens. Yes, it is cheaply built but I'm fine with that because they can keep cost down on this lens. In addition unless you plan on throwing this lens around like a football, then I'd imagine that this lens could last a while. I've taken some outdoor portraits with this lens and they came out great. For candids however I'd probably recommend something within the 28-35mm range. Due to the crop sensor on most entry level DSLR's (of which I own) it makes the focal lenght more then I would desire. Other then that it's a sharp 1.8 and you really can't beat it for the price. I'd highly recommend this lens."
2,Would not autofocus,The lens would not switch from auto to manual focus at all. The switch was stuck in the autofocus setting like it was superglued there. I took a couple of test shots and the lens would not focus at all. Everything was blurry even with one subject at five feet. Lens was sent to Canon for repair the same day I received it.
2,Perfect Lens for not a lot of time,I bought this lens to shoot newborn photos. It was a great depth of field and the images turned out clear and crisp. I loved all the photos I took with it. Note: you will need a lot of room when shooting with this lens. I loved it mostly for how little light you could shoot with this. I gave this lens 2 stars because It didn't even last a year before it broke on me. I'm not entirely sure when it even happened. I was in the middle of a newborn shoot when it stopped focusing and manual focus wouldn't even cut it. So if you buy this lens know that it's a great lens but it will only work for a short period of time.
4,"great glass, cheap construction.","great glass, cheap construction. all plastic except for the lens elements. produces great images, just don't drop it. at this price, maybe buy a backup ;)"
5,Great lens!,"This is a great lens for any photographer. It is dedicated for portrait photography giving you a beautiful bokeh effect.I really recommend it. If you want to see a video about it, go to: [...](The video is in Spanish)"
5,"Can't beat it pound for pound, dollar for dollar","Light, compact, fast, cheap. I have had mine a few months not with moderate use and have had no issues. Manual focus ring is small, but usable. I love this lens, and will not buy the more expensive F/1.4 untill i break this, If i ever do! The Immage sharpness i found to be incredible when stopped down to F/2.8 to F/5.6 and expert lens reviews confirm this. This lens actually is sharper at most F-stops than the 1.4 according to lens reviews. for the 100ish bucks this thing costs you cannot beat it!"
5,Works as a Great Macro Lens using a Macro Extender Tube,"This is a great, sharp lens. It is made of plastic and feels flimsy and its auto focus hunts a bit, but the images and colors are amazing. This was my first lens when I started on SLR photography nine years ago, and still use it today.A HUGE bonus for this lens that I discovered recently is how well it works as a macro lens using a cheap fifteen dollar Macro Extender Tube. I have uploaded several pictures taken with this lens and a macro extender tube. So if you are looking to take macro pictures, this lens can also serve that purpose."
5,Dollar for Dollar a great lens!,"Dollar for Dollar this is a must-have lens. Many have replaced their kit lens with this and I see why. Although you may not want to ditch the kit lens yet, the aperture range of this lens makes portrait shots as well as tight landscapes gorgeous! Good job!"
5,Skip the kit lens,If you want a decent lens to start with skip the kit lens. This one takes crisp pictures and with a 1.8 aperture you can get some nice depth of field isolation and shooting indoors without a flash is possible. You may miss the zoom at first but you will get used to walking.
4,small lens and small price,"Can't ask for too much more than what this lens has to offer. For the price, this lens delivers everything it promises."
4,great lens for shallow DOF,"the f1.8 does a great job in creating bokeh and shallow DOFwhen we have the correct focus, it is razor sharp.When light level falls , this lens completely gives up focusing. That's too bad because sometime I think that's the f1.8 and the ability to work in lowlight condition is the reason for buying this lensanyway, it's still a prime lens and optic quality is good enough to keep it with me after a first few shot here :[...]"
5,Unbelievable Value,"This lens is so light there's no reason not to carry it with you everywhere you go. For < $100, it is super sharp in the center, even wide open at 1.8. It produces a nice bokeh IMHO and, with the addition of an extension tube (I use a 13mm or 21mm), becomes a fantastic macro lens."
5,"For the price, this can't be beat","Using this with my 5DMkII, and it is spectacular for a lens under $100. Using MF with video mode on the 5DMkII is pretty easy, and although the AF is slower and noisier than the L-lenses, I'm not complaining at this price. Some day I'll upgrade to the 50 f/1.2 L, but for now I'm saving my $1,400 and enjoying what this lens has to offer."
4,Good Lens for Amature Photographers,"I bought this lens because I need a fast lens (wide aperture) for night/indoor photography and it's been a great addition to my camera equipment.When it arrived it was nicely packed in the box and had the warranty card so you can register it at Canon. I was a little disappointed that Canon only offers a 1 year warranty on it's products, but what can you do?I will admit the lens itself does look kinda ""cheap"" since it's made out of two or three different plastics, but the pictures look GREAT! If you have another $200 to spend I would get the EF 50mm f/1.4 since it has a USM motor if it's AF, but if your on a budget this lens will work great for you."
3,50mm,"50mm is a must have portrait lens.I got this as my first Canon prime lens due to other reviews and of course the price, it indeed gets fantastic shots. It's comfortable to compose with and lightweight.However, I recommend saving a little more and getting the 50mm 1.4 usm af with full time manual focussing. The 1.8 either needs to be in auto focus or manual focus, and the focus ring is a bit uncomfortable- it's rather thin and at the very front of the lens.Like I said though, it does perform very well."
5,Great,This lens is a lot of fun to use for not a lot of money. It's small and light so it ends up spending a lot of time on my camera and I like to take it with me even if it isn't always the most ideal focal length for the situations I'm in.
3,gr8 standard lens for the price !,"nice lens, expecially for the price. very sharp pictures with great depth of field. much more pleasing results that from the 50mm settting of either my 18-55mm zoom or my 28-135mm zooms."
3,Good Cheap Plastic & Glass,"Canon - Lens - 50 mm - f/1.8 II - Canon EFWhat do you get when you pay a little over $100.00?Well you get this ! A lens that's better then most kit lenses. It produces nice crisp images and the color is correct. Although not a Zoom, and made out of plastic you get a fairly quick, low light lens that matches close to what the eye sees. The AF is kind of junky and loud. If that's a nuisance then you could always switch it to manual. It seems for every camera I've ever owned, I've always had a fixed 50mm. And I could honestly say that this has been one of the better image producing lenses. But, If you're the type that likes to crow about your stuff then there's always the f/1.2 ""L"" for just a couple more bucks He. . . He. . ."
4,Great bang for the buck,What can I say? Is the focus loud? Yep. Is the focus ring a joke? yep. Can you get more bang for the buck? Nope. Unbelievable sharpness for $89.00.
3,Get more than what you pay for(-:,"OK, so this is not a $1200 lens, so don't expect the quality of that! This is a very cheaply made lens, hence the price....but wow...it takes great pictures for the price! The first one of these I had and dropped and it immediately broke to pieces, so I bought another. Yep, its worth dropping another $100 than $1200!"
3,"Ok for $100, but I should have waited and gotten the F1.4","This lens is OK, considering the price. The main problem I have with it is the focus. Sometimes it doesn't focus on the point that its supposed to. It also seems like it needs a lot of light to actually focus. Also it looks cheap, but then again it was only $100. If I were to do it again, I'd wait/save a little more and get the Canon 50mm F1.4 instead. It has a bigger aperture, and the USM so I'm assuming the focus would be MUCH better."
4,light sponge,Super cheap and sucks up so much light probably more than my 50mm 1.4 images are sharp but bokeh leaves more to be desired. great introduction to prime lenses
5,Great value,"I originally thought I needed a f/1.4 lens to get the effect I was looking for. However, I wasn't willing to pay more than three times the price (vs. the f/1.8). This f/1.8 worked out perfectly. Beautiful portraits, great price. I haven't used it enough to really comment on the long-term construction. At this point, I am quite pleased with my purchase."
5,500mm lens,Only wish that I had known that I also needed to order additional lens hood as lens does not accept standard 50mm hood
1,Poor quality lense. Image quality is OK but the body is low quality and it'll break easily.,I used it twice and the front part of the lense separeted from the body. It was built under very low quality standards. It looks cheap and plastic.
4,great lens for its' price!,"Using this lens with my Canon 7D is very great! I am able to film with great field of depth. If you're good cheap lens, you come to the right product. This lens is able to be on auto or manual. You are able to focus and blur the background. This lens is very good for it's price."
4,Great lens,"I bought this lens because of the reviews I read and the years of experience Canon has had to perfect this lens. I do not regret buying this lens at all, as a matter of fact I use it all the time when shooting people. Love the clarity and how easy it is to use it, but most I like the 1.8 Fstop, you get some great shots with almost no light.I would buy this lens over and over."
5,nothing you haven't read about yet...,"well just as everybody has said, i too love this lens! takes awesome pictures. you can't beat it for the price. i've never seen anything this good for such a cheap price. yes, the body and mount are plastic, but that's not a big deal to me. it works and works very well!just buy one to play with and you'll love it!i got it for $99.95 (not the cheapest price but better than other sellers) from amazon about a month ago, and haven't seen it for that price since. so grab it when you can. always sells out fast!"
5,Good lens but too close for digital,"They improve pretty well the lighting, they are much faster than my 28-105mm 3.5-4.6 so I use them on dark environments. The only bad thing for me is that they have a large focal length so not much gets in the picture if you use a digital SLR such as the Rebel XTi. If you dont care about that its a great price for lens like this."
1,Worst purchase I've ever had on amazon,"I was super excited to finally purchase this product for the price I was looking for. I have been researching this lens for a while and finally decided to pull the trigger and get it for a fun trip was taking to CA. Not only did it take 3 weeks to get to me and never got tracking on it. But when I finally got home to find the box after my trip. The lens was placed in a box without protective paper, nothing just sitting in the box. Lens are very fragile so I refused the package because of the large possibility of it being broken. So disappointed."
1,Defective unit?,"Immediately out of the box the lens was making grinding noises, It had terrible auto focus, and one month after purchase the lens housing actually FELL OUT while on a shoot. Embarrassing, Ridiculous, Unacceptable. Piece of junk..I feel like I would have gotten better quality out of a Tamron..."
1,Spend the extra $275 for the better 50mm,"This lens is cheap, focus quality is awful. I shoot with a 7D, when I switched to the 50mm 1.4f for $375 the image quality rose tremendously. The 50mm 1.8f only has 5 blades and is made out of cheap plastic, you get what you paid for. The 50mm 1.4f is much better and has a better focus area than the 50mm 1.8f."
4,Good cheap lens,"Pros: Cheap. Light.Cons: No full-time manual focus. Build quality.Apparently Canon is working on a Mark III version of this lens but who knows when it will come out.If you're short on funds this is a great lens to start out with. The build quality isn't quite there so don't be surprised when it eventually falls apart.I didn't like the very tiny switch to go from autofocus to manual focus. Also, autofocus is a bit slow on this.Other 50mm lenses to consider after you've outgrown this:~3x the cost:Canon EF 50mm f1.4 USM Standard & Medium Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras(A new version for this is also in the works according to canonrumors.)~5x the cost:Sigma 50mm f/1.4 EX DG HSM Lens for Canon Digital SLR CamerasI won't go into the 1.2 or the manual focus Zeiss 50mm lenses."
4,"YEAH! Takes pictures like a $10,000 lense","As I become a better photographer on a budget. I realize that is NOT only the camera (not everyone can afford a 5D Markiii) is about the lens, the experience and originality of the photographer. Having said that... this lens is amazing for close-up, shooting small products portraits etc. It gives you AMAZING background blur and you can't find a lens this fast (f/1.8) for the price! I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, it does feel a little cheap and it's not USM (so it doesn't AF fast)... However, for the price and what is does... it does it beautifully. The colors are almost ""TOO REAL"" - but you can always play in Adobe Lightroom and get soooo much more out of it!I LOVE IT! Until I can afford the super fast lenses... this is just fine!"
5,My best investment in photography so far.,"I read a lot of good reviews about this lens and finally bought it. Now, most of the time I have this lens attached to my camera body. I think, My best investment in photography so far. I made one of my friend buying this lens."
4,Good portait lens,I bought this lens to have a good indoor portrait lens. There is no zoom but with it's wide aperture it takes great indoor pictures with minimal light. A good lens for the price
4,Nifty Fifty,"What a wonderful Lens!!!! I got my Canon 550d about 2 years ago and was using he kit lens(EF-S 18-55) as well as a free lens off an old canon film camera (EF 35-80) but I really wanted a good lens. After doing some research i found that this was the best lens to buy in my budget. Its a prime lens so the depth of field is amazing, its a crazy fast lens so its wonderful when shooting with available light(low light), and best of all, its cheap!Pros- Fast Lens, Small/light, Awesome depth of field, Good for portraits, Fast lens, Wonderful for video, fast focus, CHEAP!Cons- Built cheap(explains the $100), Takes a bit to get use to the focus"
4,Best lens for potrait in my collection,I loved this lens and all portraits taken with this have come so amazing. This works like a charm even in low light.
1,Hoped for the best but alas...,"After getting my new Rebel as a graduation gift, I wanted to quickly to add some better lenses at affordable prices. The reviews here were helpful. This 50 mm was a good starter it seemed, but sadly after only 3 months approximately, it ceased to autofocus-- in the middle of my child's birthday party. I enjoyed it while it worked, but can't recommend any product that breaks so quickly."
2,Doesn't Last,"Tuesday afternoon, I got my 50mm lens. I took some wonderful portrait pictures with it. I loved it. I preferred it over my other 55-250mm and 18-55 mm lenses. But, my happiness didn't last for long. By Thursday night, something went wrong with the lens. It was strangely acting. It was making noise when it was attached to my T3i camera. The shutter inside the lens kept on opening and closing. I had to return this lens. But, I will order another."
4,Amateur photog loves it!,"I bought this for my wife as she is just getting started in her new photography hobby. She has noted that this lens is a great addition to her limited arsenal. It does exactly what she expected it to, and has given her a new dimension to her hobby."
3,"Nice, but not that well made.","I expected a little more from a canon lens. I've had it about a month now and already the autofocus is out (not that big of a deal because I usually use manual anyway). Also, the back housing comes out really easily and it actually messed up my camera by breaking one of the lens sensors, and I had to send away my camera to get it fixed.It'd be worth it to save up for the pricier f1.4. In fact, I'd actually recommend trying to get a fixed 35mm because you'll get more versatility out of it.Or, you know, get both of them."
5,Great little lens for the price,"I've been using this lens for about a year now on my Rebel. It is a fantastic lens for the price. Belongs in every Cannon kit. Pros are that it is fast and cheap. Under the right conditions it produces really clear shots. Cons are the AF is slow and often useless in low light. While the lens is fast enough for many low light shots--the AF and manual through the view finder can be next to impossible.I've had lots of fun with this lens playing with depth of field in soft evening lighting conditions. Also great for indoor shots of the kids where you can use a bounce flash.Considering the price, you can't go wrong with this lens. Don't waste your time with other kit lens. Spend a few hundred on a good zoom, and this lens too."
4,A must have...,"Pro's:This is a great lens for the amateur photographer who is just starting out, especially since the cost is so low. It really shows what you can do with bokeh in your photography much better than the standard kit lenses you get standard with most dslr cameras. I also like the fact that this is a prime lens which makes you ""zoom with your feet"".Con's:I think the only con I could name about this lens is that the focus ring is really small which makes it slightly more difficult to manually focus for your close-up photography.Tip: Definitely think about getting a lens hood when you buy this lens"
3,Not the best,"This lens is noisy, does not zoom (of course), but takes sharp 50mm shots. I would be better off saving up for the 1.4."
3,Not impressed so far.,I just got this and haven't had a lot of time to play with it but its definitely slow to focus and quite noisy. I know you can't expect a lot for a $110 but I guess I was expecting more. I knew the build was cheaper and read reviews but heard the shots were crisp and clear. I mainly wanted this for inside shots of the kids and dog and by the time it focuses I've lost it..time will tell. It could be the user.
4,Soft at wide open aperture,"Very good value for the money. Avoid using it wide open aperture (1.8) and this lens has sweetspot at around 2.8 or higher. Tried this at low light/no-flash/theater events and results are good. Could not get crisp focus when using at 1.8 eventhough it says focus achieved under certain conditions using center focussing point. Otherwise, this stuff is great."
4,like,"I like so far - getting used to no zoom, since i am an amateur.Looking forward to figure out how to use light, etc."
4,Affordable option.,"This lens gives me the sharpness and shallow depth of field missing with my zoom lenses without feeling like an ""investment"" lens. Perfect for portraits.If you change lenses frequently on your camera body, you should consider a more sturdy model. The lightweight plastic casing feels fragile even by Canon standards."
4,Thrifty 50,"People who buy this lens refer to it as the ""thrifty 50"" because of its low price. It has remarkably good optics (better than the kit lens) for its price, and is a good lens for newbies to learn with. Many experienced photographers continue to use this lens (or its faster successors) in dim-light situations."
5,a must for Canon SLR owners,"This is a fantastic portrait lens! (for the money) After taking a few shots with my Digital Rebel, my opinion about my camera rose dramatically (I was using the kit lens up to now). I was told many times that with the SLR, the lens determines the quality of your pictures, and after using this one I can attest to the validity of this point. You can probably get a better USM f/1.4 version but it will be much more expensive. At this price, you can't pass this by."
5,Most Excellent!,"This lens takes amazing photos. This is my first view beyond the kit-lens, and was very happy to see that my XTi can take these photos (I was worried, luckily it was just the kit lens holding it back). My take was to save the $ on the more expensive f/1.4 lens and grab this one...use it and enjoy it. If you decide you want the more expensive one, or another one...you're only out $70.00. But my guess is you'll stick with this one and spend your money on a lens from a different category. This lens is fun...a lot of fun and a purchase that comes with little to no guit."
4,maybe good but..,"I guess it's a good pair of lenses. But be aware: if you don't use a full frame, it's not so handy.I tried to use them while travelling, but every time I tried, I felt I needed to go back to the 28-55 (to use the wider angle).With a full frame, from what I heard, you don't feel this problem because the image is not cropped as it happens with other cameras.The image quality looks good, but I almost never use it.."
4,This is good choice lens,"I bought this lens first because its a good deal for the price and the results you get very good, so if you like a good bokeh shot get it !"
5,Great Pictures with this lens!!,"I ordered this lens during the Christmas and New Year holiday so i expected delays in shipping but....It arrived a day early!! Very happy with the service and the lens! I love this little lens, it takes very sharp images and they turn out very professional looking. I don't think it feels that cheap as far as construction goes...honestly about the same as the kit lens that came with the camera. I fits tightly on the mount. If I had to think of something that could be improved it would be the auto-focus motor... it's a little loud but, I'm not trying to sneak up on animals or anything so it doesn't bother me."
5,Value for price,"Amazing - Amazon and vendor are doing well to deliver this product on time in a good condition.I do not have any other prime lens of this category so can not compare. But the lens is very good, gives good bokeh, crisp and clear, ideal for portraits, also, good for landscape photography.I think it has a little bit of focusing problem but can be corrected manually.Very good canon lens at this price(I am surely surprized).Thank you canon for this product."
3,Good for the price,"The lens does great in low light situations, as far as light is concerned. But it can be very difficult to focus. The depth of feild is so short at 1.8 you need to be pretty on target on your focusing."
4,"I'm embarassed to admit I own this lens, but I like it and use it often","Review Update #1 11/23/2010This cheap lens is still working fine with no issues. I wouldn't use it for your top quality art shots, but if you're in low light, it works great.Original ReviewIt is cheap, ""disposable"", sharp, fast, accurate, and light weight. I use it for low light conditions. I did some research before buying it and found most people gave it a buy rating. It is not built to last, so don't drop it. But for the money, if you need a fast, cheap lens, this is a solution. If you have the extra money, I highly recommend the 1.4; is a much better lens with very deep saturation. But, I have taken some really cool shots with this humble 50 1.8"
4,Just Got Mine...,"Cheap as hell to the feel. But the pic quality is awesome! I just hope it lasts a year or two, because it feels really, really fragile. I believe the reviews that state something about dropping it from a foot or two up, and it breaking. i think the pic quality is worth the price and risk though."
3,Sharp but fragile,"This lens worked great for about a year until breaking. To be fair I didn't treat it like a really delicate item, but I wasn't hard on it. I would carry it with my camera in my backpack wrapped in a shirt while travelling.What happened is the inner focusing mechanism just fell out of the camera. It is all plastic except for the lens, so even moderate lateral pressure on the focusing mechanism over time will result in stress fractures in the plastic.This is a great value lens with superb picture quality, but if I had it to do over again I would have bought the more expensive EF 50mm f/1.4."
3,Good Glass Good Price Poor Build,"This lens is hard to beat for the price. The glass is good the build quality is not but then you don't have to do much to it but put it on the camera body and leave it alone. It is what it is.It's just a fast fixed 50mm lens that can give you some nice shots and isn't going to hit your pocket hard.It could almost be viewed as a ""throw away"" for the price.Not a lot else to say about it."
4,"Meh, shouldn't have traded from the 1.4","I sold my 50 1.4 to purchase some flash equipment, but after purchasing this lens I wish I would have kept the 1.4. I read that this is plastic construction, but it just feels cheap (at $100) I guess it is."
1,very bad AF,"great in total, but very bad auto focus, as much as i spend my time to tell you abut how much am disappointed about focusing in low light situation, keep searching for the focus point till you turn it to manual and show it to her..... ;0)but still great lens in that value of money( sharp, light like plastic toy, fast )"
1,poorly constructed lens,"I bought an exact same lens in December of last year from AMAZON.com (I never got asked to review that lens) while purchasing a Canon DSLR(from DELL). While I was on a field trip,the lens fell apart physically in to two segments. I had to replace it right away and I rushed to buy another of the same kind as I felt it could have been a freak problem with one lens.Apart from its being a cheap and lite it was an okay lens.I wonder if I would get it repaired if it falls physically apart again, as Canon seemed to disown any responsibility for its doing so spontaneously!As an experienced photographer for over 45 years, I have never seen a lens that came apart when used in an acceptable manner and I've my doubts as to physical stability of Canon lenses."
3,get what u pay for,"After reading many reviews on this lens,I thought it would be just what I needed for my first prime lens. I am an amateur new to the SLR world and was going for the 1.8 FStop for indoors and try to save money till I learn the ropes. This lens is truly worth every penny,but even to my untrained eyes,it is lacking even compared with the 28-135 that came with my 40D. It does feel like it might have came from Wal-Mart,I like Wal-Mart,and I think it's worth having one in your bag if you are a beginner like me or on a tight budget."
5,Amazing little lens,"I love this lens. Its so cheap yet it offers breathtaking photos with y 40D.I'm not even sure I will ever use my kit lens, 28-135mm IS. It also is a great lens but the 50 is so light and compact."
5,A must-have lens,"Really terrific lens for the money. Fast (1.8), less than $100, great for portraits. No brainer."
4,"Sharp, beautiful photographs","I picked this up a couple of years ago for Rebel when I wanted to try fixed lenses. I still pull it out from time to time. I am not a professional by any stretch, but I really do like this lens. It's great for when you want to get a crisp, clear photograph and have time to set up the shot without using zoom.I still grab my standard zoom lens more often, but this makes a great hobby lens for taking portrait types of shots."
5,Great Value,Great Product. Great Price. A little cheap on the materials. But all in all the best lens for the dollar.
2,Lens hood is a must for this cheap quality lens,"Please do not ignore the reviews on this lens when it comes to the build quality. I had always associated Canon with quality but this seems to be the one exception I've run across. I literally dropped it one foot, and it broke in two pieces on my first shoot. The glass is good, but the rest is bad, so if you must, make sure you pick up a lens hood to help prevent the same happening to you."
1,terrible quality and no options,I have had this for almost three months and only used it once just to test it out. The other day I was pulling it out of my camera bag and the lens had just fallen out of it. I couldn't even get it back in.
2,Spend the money on the 1.4 or 1.2,"This lens is made of cheap plastic and when it tries to focus it is super loud! No matter what the photos aren't crisp enough for me (a professional photographer). It is a waste of time and money. HOpe this steers someone the direction of the 1.4, a much better lens :)"
5,"sharp images, fast lens, good quality, great price","I bought this lens on a whim for my 5DM2 and was very pleased at the sharp images this thing can take with superb bokeh. For the price, it's tremendous. Sure, if you drop it on a concrete sidewalk, it's history. But I've never dropped any equipment on a concrete sidewalk. If it get's wet, it's gone. I don't take photos in the rain. So if you don't use your lens for a hockey puck and run around in the rain, buy this lens--the build quality is just fine. Why does Canon make a lens like this? Probably to let financially strapped photo students buy a decent lens. Good for you Canon."
5,DSLR N00-Bee - Canon T2i,"I use a Canon T2i and this is the only lens I use now. I absolutely love these lens! They can capture clear pictures in very little light! Just as a reminder, though, these are fixed lens...so, no zoom...you have to adjust pictures with your own body."
1,Too Fragile!!!,"I love the photos that I took with this lens. I had the lens for about 11 months and it was one of my favorites. I was very gentle with the lens and it was never dropped. Around 11 months of having the lens, the glass lens and ring fell out of the barrel as I was taking off the lens cap. The camera had not been dropped, damaged or bumped. It is a poorly constructed lens and is made of cheap plasics parts on the barrel of the lens. If you want to buy a cheap lens and are okay with replacing it every 6 to 12 months, then get this one. If you want to make a lasting purchase, then go with the 50mm 1.4."
3,Great for the $$$,This is an outstanding lens for the money. Very clear pictures! Just remember to use a tripod and keep in mind that the body is fragile.
3,Great....At A (BIG) Price,"I owned this lens for a few years, and yes, it took excellent pictures for this price point and expectations. HOWEVER, it is of such horrible build that having it on your camera may be fatal.The plastic construction fell apart on the inside and made it absolutely impossible to remove from the lens mount. Tried everything, brought to camera stores, everything...the only solution, twist plastic really hard and hope it doesn't damage the metal lens mount on the body. Sadly, I now have a Canon camera body that is useless as the AF doesn't work and it turns off at certain apertures.So...if you are very careful with this lens, don't keep it on the body and need to save money, do it. Otherwise, pay more for the more solid construction...it may end up saving you money."
4,a good lens for all occasions,Pulled it out of the box as soon as i received the package... shot some portraits at home and later over the weekend at a party... it is awesome for the price... need to experiment more
5,amatuer,this lens is great it takes great photo loved it right away its a nice bench mark for any other len I added I just got the T2i love the cam...
4,Great lens for the money ! sharp and fast and very small,"There is a allot of hype regarding lens i.m.h.o. some of my best pictures, I have taken with this lens and with digital conversion 1.6 on xt rebel OR 20D it's around 80mm great for portraits, very light and sharp, I also bought a canon rebel film camera $100 with this lens for $70 you are off to taking great pictures for very little money !The EF 50mm F/1.4 is nicer optically, well built, with nicer bokeh but It costs almost four times more though. If money is no object than by all means go for that."
4,Superb for the money,"This lens is superb for the money - nothing cheaper - not even 3rd party. Nevertheless there are some problems - focus isn't always great/fast, and manual focus ring is ackward. Build quality isnt that great and it is a little ""loose"" but it doesn't bother me much. Great back up lens."
4,"Great value, poor build quality.","People have complained about the build quality, and indeed, its sub-par. Mine got a tiny bit of sand in the focusing mechanism one day and literally fell apart...But you know what? The thing is so inexpensive that I just can't bring myself to care. No other lens is this sharp at anywhere near this price. I only wish they made a ~30mm at this price and quality, because 50mm is a bit long for general use on a 1.6x camera. Oh well."
1,Broke after 1 year,"Granted this takes outstanding pictures for not much money. But if it breaks into 2 pieces after a year of gentle use, it is garbage in my opinion. I should have bitten the bullet and got the better built f/1.4You get what you pay for ...See my pic of the broken lens - tiny plastic tabs hold the two main parts together. When (not if) the tabs break, the lens is toast."
5,Can't believe I didn't buy this earlier,"After I bought my Canon Rebel T3 I was glad with the image quality of my kit lens (18-55 mm), but always wanted to achieve that pro-looking photos you always see on the web. So recently, after a year with my kit lens, I bought the 50 mm (along with the 55-250 mm IS) and couldn't believe the time and occasions I had wasted for not buying this lens earlier.Taking pro-looking photos?, low light conditions and no flash?. All of this is possible with the 50 mm. You can take a photo at a random dog and it seems it can be used in publicity. You get so much more than you spend, so don't doubt it and buy it!!.Yes, it's plastic. Yes, autofocus isn't that good. And yet, I can't imagine better spent ninety bucks in my whole life. Maybe pot. No, the nifty fifty is BETTER."
4,Nearly everyone was right about this lens (except the 1 stars).,"This lens sounds like grinding gears when it's auto-focusing. It feels a little cheap and actually rattles when shook. So why did I give it 4 stars?!It is very sharp! And with the f/1.8, I am getting incredible depth! I know there are f/1.4 and even f/1.2 lenses out there but I don't need anything faster than this. Would I love Image Stabilization or a USM motor? ABSOLUTELY! But for 1/4 or 1/8 the price of those other lenses, it CAN NOT be beat!"
2,"Great photos, lousy build quality!",Photos are great even in low light. I had mine about a year before the auto focus stopped working. Even when it did work it was really sloooow. This lens is plastic and cheap.I'm now springing for the 1.4 (metal) version.
3,It was my favorite lens until it broke...,"I've had this lens for three months and I LOVED it. I bought it knowing that there were many reviewers who had problems with it breaking easily. But I didn't have $350-$400 to spend so I bought the cheaper option. Is the price to good to be true?? In this case I really think it is. The construction is just so cheap. A slight bump while still in the padded camera bag was all it took to break some little plastic piece inside and the whole front of the lens fell off. So if you buy this lens, just know that it is EXTREMELY fragile.As for me, I'll just wait until I can afford to replace it with the pricier f/1.4. I want a lens that is going to last."
4,"Very Sharp, Cheap Build","What a great little piece of plastic. It is small and light but like everyone says, it feels like a toy. The focusing ring is very small and not smooth. People don't buy this lens for the build quality. It's the sharpness. I love using it on my 40D. At an equivalent 85mm on a crop camera, it is the perfect portrait lens. Sharp results wide open and a nice out of focus background. The bokeh is not the greatest but if you an amateur it doesn't really matter. For the price it is probably the best deal you will ever get on a lens. If you have the money, definitely go for the 50mm 1.4 but if you're on a budget this is still a great lens. If all you own is the kit lens you will be amazed at the sharpness and what 1.8 looks like."
5,wow,"i bought this to add to my collection of lenses....i did quite a bit of research before buying it and couldn't imagine such an inexpensive lens being as good as the reviews.....to my surprise....IT IS! great lens and great price!!! until this lens came in the mail....i haven't changed the lens on my camera in almost 6 yrs....mainly because it's a great lens...perfect portrait lens....but after one shoot with the ""nifty fifty""...i can easily see this will be my new fav!!! it may well be another 6 yrs before i take it off my 1D ;)"
4,Amazing pictures. Poor build quality. Worth the buy though!,"I bought this lens a few years back, but only recently got into things in depth enough to really give it a lot of use.Most people have echo'd the same things, but I wanted to put my agreements.The picture quality is solid, sharp, and amazing. The lens is second to none for the price, and highly worth every penny. You get some amazing pictures from it as long as you have a steady hand (or tripod/fixed surface). You can't beat what you get for your 100 bucks.The only reason it didn't get five stars, and the same reason people have mentioned. The build quality leaves a lot to be desired. The plastic casing is pretty fragile feeling, but you know this is a case of ""quality for low cost"" design, and you're hopefully aware of that going in. Just baby the lens, and you'll be fine.I highly recommend it to any photographer from beginning to advanced as a nice low cost piece to your photographic arsenal."
4,nice lens,"great lens! using it on my canon t2i and love it. excellent value for the price. wish canon had more value lenses like this for amateur photogs like me who don't really need the high end, high priced lenses."
5,GREAT!!!,"Very nice lens for all kinds of work! I used for everything you can possibly imagine, flowers, birds, portrait, and it worked great!!! If you do macro work this will be perfect. I also got the Lens Hood that Amazon recommends and it gave a nice look to the lens and camera, plus good protection from direct sunlight."
4,Great shots but feels flimsy,This is a great lens for all around use and pretty much is needed 90% of the time. Its produces clear shots. I just wish it would have a depth of field meter and be made of stronger materials.
5,little pocket of Canon perfection,"A great little lens to have in your bag when you need to make those special ""phisticated"" shots.sturdy, well built/machined, tight but smooth moving rotations.Optics clear as expected from Canon."
2,"made in malaysia, not japan","I purchased this product based on the info that amazon is an authorized dealer for canon products in USA. I called canon first to learn whether USA authorized dealers are selling products that are made in different countries than Japan. They said all US canon products are made in Japan. Then, based on this info, I purchased this lens, however the one amazon sent me is made in Malaysia. Also, box was not sealed and there was no us warranty card, that means this product was a grey market product which you can buy from other dealers for a lower price. I return it and will buy from other dealers."
3,The Learner's Lens,"-Plastic-Super sharp after f4.0, attempt f1.8 at YOUR OWN RISK-Small/stubby-Too long on crop body (unfortunately 99.999% of people who bought this lens probably don't own full frame body)-Cheap-Fun to play for a short time-Not that expensive even after you're bored with its initial awesomeness"
1,Lens stuck,"This lens got stuck to my camera body. The pictures were nice, but not worth a broken camera. UGH. UGH. wow. .asdfglskjbf;l"
2,Not pleased,"I finally bought this due to the rave reviews and price. Out of the box I noticed dust on inside of lens and a possible scratch. I still tried to use the lens since I had read reviews about the lens taking on dust and usually its not a big deal unless its at the center. One day of shooting and the sharpness I had been reading about just wasn't there. Packed it up and returned it. Love Amazon.Disappointed, was really looking forward to a sharp lens. Possibly got a bad copy? Don't know."
1,Canon lens,Canon 50mm lensI should have paid more close attention when ordering since this lens is so limited as to be rather useless. I can take closeups of flowers but little else.
4,Great lens for shallow depth of field- slow to focus.,"Great lens for shallow deapth of field- slow to focus. really enjoy playing with this one, just wish it was a little quicker to focus."
5,Very sharp images,"With this 50mm f/1.8II and Canon 7D you can obtain really sharp images, even stoped down to 1.8, the lens itself is quite compact, plastic construccion, but the optics are great, a really basic lens, but that is precisely what it is meant to be. It allows you to take pictures on low light situations, keeping fast shutter speed, for portraits or other kind of images where you want everything blurred in the background"
5,Great lens for an awesome price!,"The price of this lens just can't be beat! yes, it is a barebones basic basic lens, but that is precisely what it is meant to be. It doesn't have any fancy zoom features like the expensive lenses do. And don't be fooled by the price, the quality of pictures this lens takes are top notch."
4,Great lens for the money,"I heard this lens called ""Plastic Fantasic"" somewhere. The description fits. It is light and a bit flimsy feeling and I wouldn't bang it around but then I don't do that to my expensive lenses either. The image quality from this is, in a word, ... ""Fantastic"". I don't need the faster version myself and could purchase many of these for that price. If you need the speed, spend the money on the better ones. If you want a great prime lens for portrait and other work for a little money, Get this one."
5,Great so far,"I've had this lens since October 2007, with no problems so far. It's lightweight plastic, but it still works great. It's the lens I usually keep on my camera, and I don't exactly coddle it.If you have a Digital Rebel of some sort, this is without a doubt the cheapest lens you can find that will actually give you fully sharp pictures consistently at full resolution. It's a whole different world from the kit lens in terms of image quality and versatility; you can get great pictures with this lens in low-light situations where a kit lens produces nothing but crap, and you can get shallow depth-of-field portraits that are way beyond what a kit lens can deliver."
5,Great leans at a great price,"Quick, light, and takes great photos. Glad to have this lens in my pack at any given time. Not a pro photographer so this lens was a good buy for me - inexpensive but gets the job done."
5,Great Portrait Lens,"I am a novice photographer who loves to capture portraits of people and landscape (up close). So far, this lens has exceeded my expectations! Great lens for the price. Makes me want to venture out into getting other lenses!"
3,You get what you pay for,"I am no expert on lenses, but I bought this lens to keep on my camera body for standard shooting. For the price, i suppose it is pretty good. Fast lens, good optics. Cheap build. It lasted about a year until the front optical element just randomly popped out.So not bad, if you don't mind periodically replacing the lens. Certainly not a long term investment."
4,Great first prime lens,"I've had this lens since last fall and can say it is a great starter lens. Much sharper and versatile @50mm then my XSi kit lens. With the wider aperture you can play with a shorter depth of field. Before myCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Camerasit was the sharpest lens I had.As others have said, the build quality is it's weak point. It's all plastic body makes it feel very cheap. Also the auto focus can be very noisy and can hunt a bit in low light. The manual focus ring could stand to have a little more tension.I would still recommend this lens for someone who wants to start working with prime lenses. It's great price easily trumps any build issues."
3,Snaps easily,"This lens takes great photos, but recently when the lens, in a protective case was dropped from about 2 ft. off the ground, it snapped in half. I have had the lens for about 1 year. I have read that there are ways to snap the lens back together, but it is difficult. For the price, though, the quality is about what I'd expect."
4,Great Lens for the money,"Nice little lens for the money. Am able to take great portrait shots that I wasn't able to get with the kit lens. For the money, you would be hard pressed to find a better lens."
5,"Great, low price, high speed lens for digital low light photos!!",I found this lens with it's f 2 opening to be of great use in low light digital photography.
5,"Good, fast, and cheap","With its large aperture, the lens is great for low to moderate lit, indoor shots of my kids. And being small and light, I can fit it and the 40D in a compact bag which previously housed my G3 and lens adapter.While I occasionally shoot at 1.8, f/2.5 gives good results when it comes to subject sharpness and blurred backgrounds. At under $80, this is a great buy."
4,Very good for the price,"As a novice, I've taken some really nice shots at a wedding with this. Performed well in low light. Sharpness was good.If definitely has a 'cheaper' feel to it, but it did a great job with my Digital Rebel XTi. And I'm sure it will perform even better as I figure out how to really use the features of my camera and get farther from my poin-and-shoot roots."
4,Sharper shots with Cannon EF 50,"I purchased the EF 50 f/1.8II because I was so unhappy with the level of focus I was getting with Cannon's kit lens. I asked around and received a lot of input on this prime lens before I purchased it. I'm very pleased with the sharp shots I'm getting now. However, this lens does not have a long focal length, so be aware that this is primarily for close-in shots and portraits. You can see some of my shots at [...]"
5,Absolutely Love it!,I bought this lens to attempt my friends wedding pictures. And I LOVE this lens. The price for the lens is awesome! Clarity is great...a little hurdle getting used to the fixed lens. Instead of zooming in and out you have to continually move in and out... good workout :-). Would definitely recommend the lens. I'm so happy with this purchase!
3,An OK lens,"A few months ago, I was looking to expand my lens collection. I chose this lens based upon the price and good reviews. First the price is hard to beat at under $100. The pictures taken with this lens are soft wide open, but stop it down a little and they sharpen right up. The same thing can be said about lenses costing many times more.That said, I'm not a fan of this lens. The with only 5 aperture blades, boken lights are a weird shape, not that nice round shape I've been looking for. The autofocus is loud and sounds like it's full of sand.If you're an amateur on a limited budget just starting out, then this is a fine lens. It's sharp and fast. For the more advanced amateur I'd consider savings for the 1.4. And if you have any ""L"" series glass, I'd stay away. You're going to be disappointed. For me, I just picked up a Canon 24-70L, so I'll be selling my nifty fifty."
3,at first it rocks... then it breaks.,"I waited FIVE years for a DSLR, got the one I wanted... and this lens. and... guess what. Less than a week later the lens is in 2 parts!! That's right people. One minor mishap and I can't use it. SO, IMPO save up and get the 1.4!!I am going to try to find random things around the house to sell to save up for the metal body.Off to cry into my coffee."
4,Worth It While It Lasts,"I do not regret buying this lens. I got a good year and a half out of it. I produced beautiful images and received many compliments, everyone always wanting to know what lens I used.With the 1.8, you get great versatility. The only time I had legitimate problems was in really, really bright sunlight.I'm going to be quite honest. While the quality of this lens's pictures does degrade significantly after the first few months you have it, with good upkeep, you can keep it awhile. Mine never really ""broke"" - I never had the front half fall off like what happens to most people with this lens - numerous bumps and falls and sand from the beach eventually took their toll."
5,I love this lens!,"I've had my Canon EOS rebel XSi for one year now and I upgraded from the kit lens to a Sigma 18-200mm. I decided I wanted to get a fixed focus lens when I played around with my brother's f1.4 50mm lens. After a lot of research I was set on the 50mm f1.8 because it was within my budget and I read great reviews about it. For the price that it is, it takes great pictures. The bokeh is very nice and the images are very sharp. The auto focus is sort of loud, but I don't mind because I prefer manual focus. It is completely made of plastic, almost like a toy, so I suggest just being extra careful with it and you'll be all set! For starting photographers with a budget, this is a perfect lens for you!"
2,Very loud focus,"I would have gotten the 40mm, or the 50mm f1.4 if I knew how slow and LOUD this lense is; it also feels very cheap. And on my basic Rebel XS, the image is magnified so it's really like having a 80mm lense on. It takes great photos in low light settings."
1,Aweful quality,I would like to return this product and get the f/1.4 however I lost the receipt. Do NOT waste your time with this lens.
1,Disappointed!,I was disappointed that the lens did not work on my son's camera even though it cas a canon camera. It connected for just a few minutes and then would not work so we had to return it.
4,"Great optics, but cheap construction","This was my first canon lens. For the price, the images are unbeatable. The lens makes great stars when the aperture is cranked down to f16 or so. Also has really good bokeh and depth of field. My major gripe though, is that the lens is very cheap. I dropped it once and now have something stuck in-between the elements which is not normally noticed except in low-light, where it really flares bad now. Luckily its such a cheap (price-wise) lens that its not as bad."
5,"The ""Go To"" lens",This lens should be in every photogs bag. It's my Go To lens and works for portraits and low light. Not too big of an investment for a great product.
2,Lens Fell Apart,"I purchased this lens because of all of the outstanding reviews it had received. I was thrilled to have a lightweight lens for my Canon 7D as the other lenses I have are quite heavy. Although it had a plastic casing, so many reviewers felt it produced excellent images. I was sold and agreed this was good purchase and, indeed, I liked the images produced with this lens.However, now I have a different perspective about the lens. In the middle of taking a photo about a month after purchase, the front of the lens literally fell to the ground. I could not believe it came apart. This also damaged my Tiffen UV Protector filter. I have contacted the seller and will await the response before commenting about customer service. Perhaps I just received a defective lens and all will be remedied with a replacement. None the less, I wanted to post this review as a indication that perhaps you get what you pay for!"
2,Confused,"I read all the great reviews and I was sold. This is the lens for the price. I guess it sure is because one day I was trying to shoot with it and it was making funny sounds so I switch from AF to MF and then the glass falls on the carpet and front of me and all I can think is ""uh oh."" Apparently to repair this puppy it costs about $30 more than buying a new one, that's pretty standard for the throw-away society we live in today."
3,Great lens but the 1.4 is really a better choice if you're into the detail,"Yes its a great deal, but if you're investing in this because you're into the details of the hobby, you'll quickly see why the 50mm 1.4 is better in every way. Like most lenses, both 50mm's are not at full sharpness wide open and the 1.4 just gets sharper faster at any aperture. And if you're buying this for speed (and pretty much most are) then you're looking to dabble in the art of depth of field. The 1.4 again, simply does this much better with smoother bokah (blur) in the out of focus areas. It took me a while to realize that all those little pentagons in the 1.8's bokah where due to the bargain 5 blade aperture and made me realize why I needed to belly up for the 1.4. Of course all those things are even better with the 1.2 but for my money, the 1.4 is really the sweet spot of price/performance in the lineup. Your mileage may vary."
5,"Great, Great lens","This lens is really a keeper and Awesome. I purchased this for night time videography and it has exceeded my expectations. I not only use it for night time but i use it for most of my photography because of the great depth of field and it takes really nice portraits. It is made of light weight plastic which does feel cheap, but who cares when you see the quality you put out. just dont drop the thing. Another thing you must really watch your depth of field so you wont have blurred shots. Totally worth more then twice the asking price."
5,Nice!,"Build quality - just OKManual focus switch - very stiffAutofocus speed - just OKLens flare - some night shots with bright lights will require more hardware and/or editing laterLens getting stuck on body - no problems with Rebel or 40DBokeh - pretty much awesome all the time, web reviews can fill you in on the minor shortcomingsIf you don't have a lens that already does what this does, then either get the 1.4 version or this one. Either way, you will grow as a photographer!"
5,Awesome for its price,"The Canon EF 50mm f1.8 lens its awesome considering the price. It produces great quality pictures, bokeh is cool at f1.8. Also, is bit slowly and noisy when focusing; it feels like a toy due to its plastic contruction, but it's not a major problem...My opinion... The canon ef 50mm f1.8 is GREAT!"
5,This should be your first and probably most used lens,I'll keep it short.If you have children and pets and you're tired of losing a shot because of poor light or too much motion you need this lens. This is fast glass and a bargain basement price and you shouldn't be without it.
5,"Way better than your standard, a must have for the xsi camera or any canon camera!",wow! no need to use the Flash with this lens! The difference is amazing from the standard f4.5 lens 15-55 to this f1.8 50mm lens. It's a must have and at this price it's worth all the wonderful pictures you will get from it. Don't wait to buy it!
4,Great Deal,I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses.
3,Good photo quailty but not for SLRs with high corping factor,"As a price and quality is very good, excellent!This lens is not good for SLRs with high cropping factor like mine Canon EOS 350D or (Digital Rebel XT) which is 1.6. The photo looks zoomed and if you want to capture something with wider angle is a problem.But if you want to shoot portraits, good choice!"
1,Broken on first try,i bought this lens and it came in while i was on vacation and was waiting for me. i was excited because everyone told me this was a great lens and very sharp. Now that may be a fact but i will never know because once i attached the lens to my camera it made a grinding noise as i tried to focus. when i detached the lens the front element glass fell from the body of the the lens housing. This will most likely be my first and last canon lens if the seller doesn't replace.
3,"Lens maybe OK, Price different, & Packaging Attrocious!",I purchased a lens and filter. They charged me for the filter that was supposed to be a gift and the packaging consisted of two of the air filled bags in a box that should have had 4 at a minimum to keep things from bouncing around. The air bags arent shaped to stop things from flopping around. Where's the peanuts? Frankly I'm amazed it even works at all. When you get a box with a lens in it it doesn't make you happy to hear things rattling around in it. I'll have to try it now a week to make sure all the features work. But I'll never know if the life has been shortened or when it stops a 3 months later if packaging was the problem and I'll have to pay for the return. I will never order something fragile again from these people.
3,"Good lens for the price, but otherwise not so good","I am an amateur photographer that interns with a professional photographer. Because of this, I am spoiled with using nice lenses, especially the Canon L-series.I bought a Canon 40D along with this lens and the 28-135mm kit lens. At first, I was in love with this lens. It is nice for close ups, as the bokeh is beautiful. Once I started taking more pictures though, I was displeased with how blurry the pictures were. They were just not sharp and clear like I wanted!If you are an amateur portrait photographer who doesn't have much cash like I did, this is the lens for you. It is very good for close ups, but otherwise, it is lacking in its sharpness."
5,A Must Have,"After buying nothing but L lenses, i thought I would give this another shot! Originally bought it when photography was fairly new to me and didn't really like it. Now that I know more on what I'm doing, def. a must have in my collection. Very clear pics and super-fast as well. Does look quite cheesy compared to my 70-200 2.8 IS but who cares. And on top of all that,[...] I'd give a lot more than that for it. One more thing, build qual. is very cheap but who cares, I'll be buying another one when this breaks"
4,"Good aperture, very fast","This lens is a very good purchase. very cheap. I think that the material and quality arent so good. I miss the USM motor!! its very noisy!!BUT, i can take great photos under very low light condition. I can get an area of my pic very sharp and not the rest!Excellent to take portraits.I did not quilify this item with 5 starts becuase of the noisy and not so good construction.But I recomend this for the low price, you must have it ;)"
5,5 stars for the price and speed,"This lens is great because it's both cheap and fast. Sure, it's plastic but the glass is good. Don't expect to take it mountain climbing. I'm on my second one because my son pulled the camera off a table (a height of about 3 feet) and the lens came apart. Autofocus is slow, but most of the time you'll need to focus manually anyway. In the low light that this lens exceeds, the autofocus is useless. Just an aside about the wide aperture, it's very tough to focus on a close subject in low light. The depth of field is so narrow and detail is difficult to make out. I usually end up ""bracketing"" my focus. Anyway, buy it...what the heck!"
5,"Wonderful lens, great price","This is my first non-kit SLR lens that I've owned and very happy with the performance thus far. The fast f/1.8 aperture is wonderful to use in low-light conditions, especially indoors. On top of it, the narrow depth-of-field at that aperture blurs the background nicely for wonderful portraits. I've heard the lens is rather fragile and the plastic construction is not durable, but keep in mind you are getting a fast SLR lens for close to a bill. I have only had it a month but believe it will hold up well if you take care of it. If you wanted something more professional or sturdy, you could spend triple the price and get the upgraded f/1.4 lens, the choice is yours..."
5,The famous 'Nifty-Fifty',"At the price for thislens everyone who shoots a Canon DSLR should have at least the f1.8. Very light and easy to use. Of course there is the arguement about it being all plastik but hey, what do you want for the money?? Besides I baby all my gear so that is not a consideration for me vs the performance of the lens. It's tack sharp and a fun little lens."
4,Great!,Even though it's cheap my new lens is very fast and accurate. The focus is not so bad. I like it. I recommend that lens!
4,Not ugly and a great bargain,"I don't understand why one reviewer called this ugly. My lens has a smooth black matte finish and the plastic casing has a sturdy feel. It's lightweight so my hands don't tire quickly when taking lots of pictures with my Canon 30D. The sharpness of my pictures is much more than I expected for such an inexpensive lens. It's not good for close-up work and I had to play with all the settings to see which would yield the best photos. Overall, it's a great bargain for hobbyists and amateurs."
4,super fragile great lens,Like others I had one split open while in my camera bag (no bouncing). Other than that it's great. So be extra extra careful and enjoy this cheap lens.
3,"good, not great","for amateurs, this is a very nice lens to have. it's cheap and very sharp stopped down below f/2. If you can afford it, though, get the 50mm f/1.4. the images from the 1.4 are slightly better, but the thing that really sets it apart is the focusing. the 1.4 has USM focusing while this one does not. this lens takes forever to focus in low light and intense light. sometimes I can't get it to lock on at all and I have to manual focus. even then some times I can't get it to confirm that I'm in focus."
4,Good lens.,When in focus and f>2.8 the images are great.Sometimes my 350 XT is having problems with the auto focus. I can take 10 pictures in a raw and half will be out of focus. I don't have such problems with Canon 85mm USM lens.But for the money it's unbeatable. If you have some extra cash - buy 50mm 1.4 USM
4,Very good for the price,"My own opinions on this lens are very similar to what I have read elsewhere, viz., that it is a very good lens for the price. Testing showed the first lens I got to be pretty soft, especially around the edges and especially at f/1.8 and f/2. I returned it and Amazon very graciously sent me another which was better. In summary I would say that at f/4 and above it is really quite sharp, and you have the higher speed if you need it. Stick to the center of the lens (at the higher apertures) if you can. Not the best lens in the bag, but not too shabby either.rps"
5,Can't beat this lens for the money!,"This is just simply the best lens that you can get for the money for a canon camera. The 1.8 means you can capture images in almost any light without the use of flash. It is true that it made pretty cheap, and I had one completely fall apart on me with normal use (mainly used indoors for family photos)... but I liked it so much I bough another instantly. I can replace it another couple of times before it comes near the cost of it's nearest competitor, but I guess it shouldn't be your only lens .. just in case it falls apart. Buy it, you won't regret it."
4,A great lens with its low price,"Pros:Low price; excellent picture, very sharp; llight weightCons:No USM, sometimes focus hard in low light condition."
4,Really good lens,"I have used this lens for 3 months and find out this is really useful, espacially for taking close-up facepictures. And one more good thing is that it is bright so I can take a picture in rooms and night."
3,Good for price but depends on your needs,Good lens considering the sub $100 price. Image quality was good and the f/1.8 was nice in low light situations. The one major drawback for me was the slow auto focus. Since I wanted this lens for indoor high school sports like volleyball and basketball that was a deal-breaker. I tried it out for a couple of games and it just could not keep up with a moving player. I returned it in favor of the pricier F/1.4 USM which will hopefully do better.
4,"Fantastic, plastic","As everyone says, this lens is impossible to beat for the money. Better than the kit lens wide open, my copy gets crazy-sharp stepped down.I recently used this lens for some walk-around architectural shots and was amazed when I opened up the images on my computer. For most, no sharpening in Photoshop was warranted.Great for portraits, but a little narrow on a crop-sensor camera."
4,Solid Lens,"The price is fairly cheap for a nice lens. Yes, you have to use your feet to get closer but the lens does take great pictures. It doesn't focus as fast as the 85mm for sports but it is a good lens at a bargain price. If you can use this length of lens, you won't be disappointed with the results."
5,Awesome,Just 1 word.. Awesome.. excellent and beautiful color quality. I am not a professional. But whatever pictures where clicked turned out to be superb and appreciated by everybody too.. Thumbs up.. Highly recommended
4,Like alot,"This lense takes great close up pictures, I use it alot to take pics of my grandbabies. I want to get the 50mm 1.4f , I think thepics are more sharper with that lense"
4,Nifty 50,I had no Idea how much fun I would have with this lens! Besides the cheapo construction it is a great lens. I love the low light capabilities and playing with the DOF.This lens is a must for anyone starting out in photography
5,Amazing lens for a bargin price,"This lens is a great portrait lens.Opens wide for low light, pin sharp and very compact.OK it could be built a little better and maybe focus a little quicker/quieter but for under $100 it cannot be beaten"
3,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens,"Great lens for the money. If money is not the issue, get the 50mm f1.4. The f1.8 is a good lens, but if you're really serious, get something a little better constructed with a better bokeh."
1,faulty for the second time,"faulty. focus ring stuck. a lens should last years!! not months!! This is the second one that has failed, and I have only used it once. I would not recommend this lens, because it is apparently too fragile or has a manufacturer flaw."
5,Pretty good for low light pictures!,"Tried this lens, and all I have to say is amazing for low light/night time scenarios! The wide aperture helps in capturing dimly lit images with such a ease that one can do away with the use of tripod! The image quality is pretty good, especially, the shallow DOF pics come out amazing!The only thing I did not like in the lens is the amount of time it sometimes takes for auto focusing; it would make clinging noise when trying to auto focus, but once you have the focus, it will do its job!Again, good value for the money!"
5,Great lens for the price!!!! buenisimo!!!!,"Better than expected for the price. highly recommended. you will be happily surprised!Buen lente a bajo precio, altamente recomendado. no creo que encuentren algo así por el mismo precio. funciona de maravilla."
5,Best value for the price,"I just ordered one of these upon seeing what my friends have been doing with this particular lens.If you're just starting out with photography, or are on a budget this lens is definitely worth the price. At $75-$100 USD, you literally will not get anything better without paying around 4x the price. Images are a little soft when wide open (but still very nice) and sharpest at f/8 (beats out some very expensive lenses at that point). The only problem you might have is with the plastic build of the lens, but at $100 or so, you'll probably get your moneys worth out of it."
4,excellent lens,"Wow...good lens...works good, excellent for portrait. Good clarity,perfect with kit lens. I highly recommend this lens to anyone. Superb product from canon."
4,Awesome lens,"Very good lens, takes sharp pictures at f2.8. Images may be a little soft at f1.8. Build quality is not terrible for this price. With no image stabilization you will see some blurry images but most of my snaps turned out to be keepers."
2,Not quite so,"This lens is nice outdoors, but sucks in low light indoor photography! Cheaply made so the one time i dropped it ON CARPET, it broke after two months. The focus is loose (hit or miss), but nice bokeh effect in background. Good For a beginners lens for the price."
5,Very happy,"5 star product. Best value in photography! If you don't have one already, get one!! I highly recommend this lens to everybody for excellent image quality."
4,Canon EF 50MM f/1.8 II Lens,What an absolute surprise! This inexpensive lens has performed extremely well and has never failed to focus fast and accurately. Excellent picture quality!
5,Amazing !!,"Delivery was very prompt. Got the necessary depth of field for portrait pictures. Being a novice in the field of DSLR it took me a while to get used to the low F number, but the quality of pictures were amazing !! Highly recommend for someone who's starting out with a Canon DSLR."
5,"Better ""portrait"" pictures","This review based on 2 weeks of usage:ConsBuild quality is very cheap as you might expect. It utilizes plastic construction right down to the lens mount except for the lenses of course which are made of glass :)This is one of loudest lenses I have!!! Since I don't use it as my wildlife lens, the noise won't bother me!!!.Autofocus is driven by a micro motor. Focus speed is not stellar, but fine in good light with subjects that are not moving too quickly.This lens ships with no lens pouch/case. You have to hunt for a pouch that fits right!!!ProsDon't be fooled by above comments, this Lens delivers very sharp images as inexpensively as Canon lenses can get!!!This lens is a very good low-light indoor photography lens for the price tag!!!Bottom lineLove it for the price and sharp pictures, Canon should release more lenses like this!!!"
5,Great lens,"I bought this lens for portrait photgraphy, mainly. It works great for that purpose with my Canon T3i, considering the price. See an example of a picture taken with it: goo.gl/HQPbq"
3,Ok for the price,"Build quality for this lens is exactly as many people have noted. It is very light and simple with no real features except the lens itself. On manual focus I have taken some very impressive shots with this lens and I have to say I really like it. but. I suspected something was up when I wasn't getting nearly the same image quality on autofocus. Finally, the autofocus started truely acting up and either giving me out of focus images or failing to focus at all and error-ing out. Sent it in on warranty and repairs were very speedy (Canon had held up to its name on that bit at least). Keep track of the warranty if you buy this one. You may need it."
5,"Great for beginners, like myself","I bought this lens for my used Canon A2E slr, and it works wonders. It has become my most used lens. It is a plastic lens, its obviously not the best-made lens out there. It does exactly what I need it to do."
3,"Cheap, great image, but HORRIBLE auto focus","It's a 50mm prime. A lens that probably everyone with an SLR should have. It's crisp, and it's cheap. It's really a great buy. Just know that the auto focus on this is unusable, and you will resort to leaving it on manual focus after about 5 minutes. Manual focusing isn't a bad option, it's just something to be aware of."
4,Nice inexpensive lens,"This is a nice lens for the very inexpensive cost. I personally prefer a zoom lens for versatility and it is missing Image Stabilizer, but is still very good quality for the money. If you have a steady hand you will appreciate this lens."
4,Bad Copy?,"I am on my third copy of this lens. The first was not sharp. Sent it back. The second was all everyone promises. Sadly, I threw that lens in with a camera sale because now, on my third copy, I am back to wishing I had the second one back. I will probably sell this one and try to get another good copy. Moral of the story, I think the build is inconsistent."
2,"Great lens and all, but handle with care!","I agree with most comments here. It's a lot of bang for the buck. But this lens is not robust and should be handled with care. Because the mount is made of plastic instead of metal, frequent switching between lenses can cause damages and in worst case it won't come off anymore. My 50mm got completely stuck and I had to resort using brutal force to remove it from the body, destroying the lens in the end. Fortunately my body remained intact. My advice is to be careful and always take the lens off very gently and firmly push the unlock button. Although I loved the pictures I shot with this lens, the build quality just put me off. But in fairness what to expect for a 100 euros (130 dollars). So my next 50mm will be the 1.4.~ Jan Willem, Netherlands"
5,Go to lens,I'm now in love with photograph! This lens is amazing! This is coming from a person who used my iPhone to take photographs so don't go thinking I'm some professional. One day though!
2,Strong back focus,"I bought this lens as a gift for birthday. Item was delivered couple days before the scheduled arrival time and the packaging was just fine. But the lens happened to have a very noticeable back focus so camera didn't focus properly (especially on apertures 1.8 - 4.0) and most of pictures come out blurry. Too bad, going to return it and buy 50mm 1.4"
4,"It does what is intended, wider aperture.","Works as expected, great for lower lite photos and shallow depth of field. However, you get what you pay for. Very light plastic feeling, compared to my other lenses."
3,Low build quality,"Nice images, but it will literally fall apart if you so much as look at it wrong. Have gone through 2 of these now. Time for a real lens, very frustrating!"
1,maybe i got a lemon,"this lens is FANTASTIC...except i had to buy it from a store instead of amazon. the one i bought on amazon must have been defective, because it only worked once and then the next time i turned my camera on i got lens errors. returned promptly."
5,its the bomb,its badass. 1.8 kills it in a good way. great for a portrait semi close lens. cant beat the price.
2,"Had it two days, then it FELL APART!","I was excited to see the rather excellent picture quality of the lens. But after two days of very gentle shooting the lens simply fell out of its barrel. I'm not kidding. I'm very disappointed in this because I'm used to much better quality from Canon.Great price, great picture for the money but boy is it a piece of junk in terms of construction!"
4,Great value for a good all around lens,This lens is more compact than I had even hoped. It makes my Rebel XTi more travel friendly. Once in awhile I wish that I had a zoom on there but mostly its the right lens for most everything I need my camera for. I personally think this lens is an essential lens. I wish other lens' I have bought in the past were so satisfying.
4,Just what I was looking for.,"So far this lens has been great for me, especially for the price. For someone who isn't a pro, this lens works really well and I didn't have to empty out my wallet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for a low budget 50mm lens."
5,Good Job,"It is a good product, the shipment was on time without problems the product was in good conditions. The lens is just like you can see on the web."
3,never got the lens...,"Well, I ordered express overnight shipping on this lens (ordered before 10 am on Wed) and never recieved it. I needed it by that weekend (hence the overnight delivery) , so I called Amazon on Friday and they basically told me that it was lost and were going to refund me the money I paid on it. Went out to our local camera store, bought the same lens for about $15 more. I really like the lens, its sharp and does great in low light (took it to a wedding on Sat. and it performed really well in the dark) but the shipping fiasco just infuriated me. Not sure where the fault lies--with amazon or this seller, but I was definitely not happy with this particular purchase via Amazon."
1,lens with waste !!!!,"I bought the lens and inside the lens is waste , I can not believe Amazon sells second selection things ..... WARNING !!!!!!"
2,Ahhh the nifty fifty,"You get what ya pay for! This is the much-talked about ""Nifty Fifty"". Out of the box it feels cheap and plastic, why because it is a cheap build and plastic!1) AF in low light... Not good it hunts2) Sharp Not at all3) Build well as stated, plastic build plastic lens had it for less than a year and it is CRAP4) Go to ebay and buy a Asahi Pentex 50mm and an adapter ring and learn to focus manually for half the price! Really I own 2 and they way out work this cheap Canon lens geared towards the hobbyist looking for a correct all ""I am a pro"" lens.5)"
2,spend the money on the 1.4,i own the 1.4 and this 1.8the difference is huge. the 1.4 is fast and quiet and SHARP. the 1.8 was terrible in comparasion. none of the photos looked all that in focus or sharp.PLEASE do not waste your money on this. pay the extra 200 for the 1.4
3,"Fantastic image quality, but frustrating.","This is a great little lens, with a tragic, ironic flaw. For all its wonderful image quality and ability to gobble up light, its almost completely worthless in even slightly dim lighting due to the TERRIBLE low light focus performance. I've come to think of it as a manual focus lens, its so bad. And without a flash, there is no focus assits lamp. Now I may be the problem here, perhaps there is a way to utilize the focus assist lamp without using the flash? If anyone can correct me on this, PLEASE DO SO!! I'd love to be proven wrong on this as I really love everything else about this lens."
3,you get what you pay for,"This is a mediocre lens at best. It is very soft wide open. The bokeh is terrible both wide open and stopped down a bit (5 blades). Color and contrast are mediocre as well. The worst part is the AF. It is very inconsistent even in good light.This lens is very popular among beginners, and there was time when it offered much better image quality compared to the old 18-55 kit lens for crop bodies. Not so much anymore because the 18-55 IS is so much better than the old kit. The 50/1.8 can still be useful stopped at least at f/2.8 and it takes super sharp pictures at f/4, when it focuses well (almost never). With a crop body, in a typical scene, f/4 has enough DOF to mask the poor AF. More experienced users will be frustrated however."
5,Wonderful lens for portraits!,"I purchased this lens by mistake. I just got a digital SLR and to say that I had no idea what I was doing would be quite an understatement. But after using this lens for a short time I was impressed. This lens is incredibly fast and takes wonderful portrait shots. The subject, whether it's a person or a salad really pops and the colors couldn't be more vibrant. I've had no problems with the overall quality or construction. I've used it for over 2 months now hauling it with me on vacations to Europe, to graduations and elsewhere and it has performed magnificently. I think that anyone who is interested in portrait photography should look into this lens. Oh, and I forgot to mention, as far as lenses go it's relatively inexpensive."
5,Great fixed lens,"This is the first lens I purchased as a replacement for my kit lens. I find it very useful when shooting portraits during family gatherings. I, and those who have viewed my pictures, really enjoy the depth of field that can be created through the use of the lens. This lens can seem difficult without a bit of training. If you're interested in photography and like to manipulate the settings on your camera, this lens is great for practicing and learning different photographic principles."
5,LOVE IT!!,"I have had my lens for about a month not to long but have taken lots of shots with it. I was never able to get a good shot in our gym and I got some great shots last week, not action shots like sports(I have not tried that it was a pie in the face.) They turned out way better than any other time I have tried to take shots of any thing in the gym. I love it for portraits as I am working on building a photography business and this lens is great indoors with my natural light!! No complaints for the price! Love how small it is also."
3,Overrated,"Yeah, it is sharp and cheap. But cheap plastic feel, lack of a good manual focus ring that can be easily grabbed and turned, no markings for focus distance, slow auto focus, and a basic ""Fast"" f-stop (been making it since the 60's) leave me disappointed. I can't believe the rating is so high for an obvious cheap, basic item for a reasonable price. Save the big stars for the actually good products and give this thing the mediocre rating it deserves."
5,L O V E,"I am a huge fan of researching lenses (or anything else I buy for that matter) to DEATH before committing. Even though this lens has a low price point I was nervous to buy it. My husband finally convinced me and I made the ""big"" purchase.Honestly, besides owning a sharp wide lens & macro lens (hopefully in my future), I don't see why I'd have to ever buy another lens.I have taken some killer portraits with this lens and the colors are great and it's super sharp with amazing bokeh.I don't know all of the fancy photog lingo but trust me, this lens is worth every penny."
4,Quality Images at the right price,"I've been on the hunt for a great portrait lens, and after speaking to a few different sales reps at camera stores I decided the 50mm was the one for me. I've heard quite a few complaints that the f/1.4 motor fails after a short amount of use, and feared spending 2x as much on a product I may have to quickly replace. While I've only had this lens for a short period of time, it does the job for me! I'm very amateur, but this lens has created great images with a sharp focus, and beautifully blurred background. I'll be sure to post some images soon! Some complain of the noisy motor, doesn't bother me! While the body is fairly light weight, I think if you handle it properly and don't toss it around, it should last the desired amount of time."
4,Super Duper!,"This is my lens of choice right now! It is very quick and reliable! I am a portrait/fashion/commercial photographer and I never go to a shoot without this lens in my arsenal! I am in love with teh DOF and speed of this piece!I have found that the focus can be slow and bunky in extremely low low light situations- but those are usually REALLY low light conditions!Here are a few samples of my work:all rights Reserved MichaelDonovan 2006MikeChicago, IL"
4,GREAT lens for the money,"I'll admit this was an impulse purchase. A friend of mine has a 50mm lens and took some great shots I couldn't get with my longer zoom. And I needed something shorter for my Canon 10D body.The lens is plenty sturdy, autofocuses great, and just takes nice photos."
5,price?,Just curious as to why the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II costs $25 more on Amazon than it does on the Canon website...only $99 if purchased directly from Canon USA.
4,Great lens for simple portrait shots,"This is the standard low cost lens for taking macro / portrait pictures. I like to take photos but I'm not an expert. It takes pretty good quality portraits under natural light. Since it's not a zoom lens, your feet will have to do the moving to frame the pictures. I only used it a few times, so I can't comment on the durability. But it looks decent solid enough."
4,Awesome value for your money...but a bit restricting on my crop sensor camera,"This was my first lens purchase for my Rebel xti. I was warned by a photographer friend that this 50mm may be a bit restricting on my crop sensor camera but I went ahead and purchased it anyways. Boy was he right! I can barely get about 2 faces in the frame before my back hits the wall in my living room. Although I'm probably going to need a 30mm or a zoom lens soon if I want to take pictures of more than one person at a time, this 50mm lens is DEFINITELY worth the money. $125 for a Canon Prime lens with max aperture....can't go wrong with that! :)"
3,Bang for the buck but be aware of bad copies from Canon USA!,"I have got a bad copy. It's a refurbished one from Canon USA as I planned to have 85mm 1.8. When it worked, it's easy to use and the quality of picture was satisfactory. 50mm and 60D would work together very well. It's more versatile than 85mm because of 1.6 crop factor. However, with this copy, after about 10 test shots, I got the error message. After it's taken off and put back, it worked again. Then, only after a few more shots, the problem came back again. This happened with my Canon 60D camera. So I had to return it within 3 days, but it's a little pain to deal with Canon USA, and I had to pay 2 shipments (both delivery and return) even for this defective lens. This bad experience has cost me $25+, that's a lot of money for a cheap lens like this. Because of 50mm's versatility for crop bodies, later I will not get 85mm 1.8 but 50mm 1.4 which has better construction quality and USM, and I'll stick with Amazon from now on."
5,Awesome lens,"It is best economical Canon lens, produce the best results. perhaps the best solution for portraits For 100 bucks, every EOS owner should have one."
5,"Sharp & clear, great bang for buck.",For what you pay the 50mm 1.8 is pretty hard to beat for solid portrait and low light work.
4,"Fun, inexpensive lens.","I enjoy this lens. It takes great pictures and the advantage of having the f/1.8 is a great addition to my lenses. I mainly use the L series Canon lenses which out preforms this lens. I needed something good...yet NOT 1,000$ for close up/portraits with something better than the kit lens for my camera. This was a good choice and its certainly been a lot of fun using this lens. Recommended."
5,A must!,You must get this lens since it's very affordable. You get great pictures at low light conditions. Most of my best pictures so far came from this lens.
5,Great Lens,Cheap. Sharp. Fast. Awesome pictures. Go buy this lens and your friends will love you for it.
3,Good for price,"I bought this b/c a friend suggested it. I was taking a beginner photo class and needed something that would yield decent results but at the same time wouldn't break the bank.This lens has been the only one I've used for the past couple months. And I like the images that I've taken with it. My only gripe is the autofocus; not only is it incredibly loud, it doesn't work too well in low light conditions."
3,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens review,Good optics. Plastic is too delicate. Worried it may collapse at any moment in my camera bag. Expect good pictures till it lasts. Sharp focus and reasonably good resolution even at high ASA.
5,Little Gem,"This is a little power house of a lens.Should carry the 'L' badge.Simply can't go wrong at this price.., go out and get one!"
5,Best lense you can buy for that kind of money,"Canon designed this lens to be their high performance, low cost option. Yeah, it's a prime lens, it has a plastic mount, there's no distance scale, and the focus ring is small, but for the price and optical quality, who cares. If I ever do break off the mount, I can buy another one and still have paid less than it would have cost for a used mark-1. You can always get more lenses, but you will still use this one even if you are a pro. Basically, if you care about optical performance and you're not loaded, buy this lens."
4,I love it!,"I'm thoroughly enjoying this lens. At the moment, I'm using it more than my other lenses. Shoots in extremely low light. Great for portraits. Very light, so it is an easy lens to carry around on your camera."
5,Great Starter Portrait Lens,"Amazing! Even though I am still a novice and learning more and more in the photog world everyday, I really love this lens. That being said, beyond the real technical comments, seeing the results from this lens vs. the stock lens that came with my XTi, have made me a true believer in the 50-fixed with wider aperture. I have been looking for a great starter lens as I start up my own in-home photography business, but haven't wanted to spend a lot of money. I would recommend this to anyone in the ""start-up"" world of professional photography. Not only that, but I don't believe you can really focus on all the other aspects of taking pictures (i.e. lighting, posing, composing the shot, etc.) until you have a lens that really enables you get good exposure even in lower light situations. No real complaints here, just looking forward to purchasing an L series next!"
5,50mm canon lens,My first single focal length lens. I'm still trying to adjust it...but its getting better. Very light.
4,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Lens,For the money you can't go wrong. It is light and feels cheap but it takes great photos. I am able to take some great shots in very low light without flash using this lens. It gives me a lot of versatility in low light situations. You can't go wrong buying this lens.
3,Not a very good lens.,"I am going to be frank. the AF misses most of the time, and produces soft photographs. Sometimes the lens quite Autofocusing for some reason. When you press the button half way it makes a little noise, nudges a little, and stops. The lens is pretty soft wide-open, closing down to f/2.8 makes the images much sharper. It's not extremely soft, but it's not the sharpest. A plastic mount/body is not very desirable in the world of SLR photography, but for $90, you are definitely compromising key features. For the price, it's a great lens. However, in general it's not a great lens. If you are on a tight budget, and do not have semi-professional expectations, this would be a great lens for you. You get a lot more back for your buck with the f/1.4 version. A USM motor, faster in low light ( and sharper ), and better build are the main advantages with the f/1.4. For the money it's not bad."
4,Bang for the buck,"Feels light and cheap but takes some wonderful shots. A must have for parents! Takes clear, quality shots. I love to leave this lens attached for the quick ""run grab the camera"" shots!"
5,excellent,it works well in low light conditions.i got great results with this lens even though i am just an amateur. definitely a good buy.
5,LOVE IT,Just as described love it love the quality of the item as well. The pictures are so clear and the AF button really helps with my shaky hands. Received mine really fast.
2,I was disappointed...,"I received my lens quickly in the mail and of course immediately started playing with it as soon as I got it. First off, the motor is INCREDIBLY loud. Secondly, it wouldn't focus in auto mode and continued to distort the colors. I don't know if this is just me or this is true for everyone. It was usable on manual focus and I had to keep playing with the exposure settings and white balance for it to expose correctly and be true to color. Keep in mind this was with the same environment. The pictures I got after all these adjustments were nice but I'd sooner save the 100 bucks and put it towards upgrading to the USM motor. Unfortunately, mine is going back immediately."
5,Excellent product,"The best lens for this price... in really love this lens, the pictures taken with this lens are awesome, is the lens you need to buy after the kit lens of your camera"
4,Great value,"I think the other reviews pretty much cover it: this is a great lens at a great price. It does feel a little less than solid but I don't want to shell out 4 times as much for the F1.4 version. Lets see how long it lasts - I think with care it might go a long way. As far as the quality of the glass, its great. My other lens is a f3.6 and its amazing how much 3 f-stops can do to your indoor photography."
3,good glass... lots of plastic,"so I pick this lens because it was much more easier on my pocket book then the 50 f1.4.... I kinda wish I would have ponyed up the cash and bought that one... but I bought this one... the pics are good... great glass, fast, and great depth of field... but I just cannot get over the plastic... feels like an egg in my hand... I'm afraid I'm going to break it... however for the price it is a fantastic lens... a great buy... just treat it carefuly... also the auto focus seems to hunt around for a bit and is pretty loud... it is an old style motor so what could you expect... all and all it ia an ok lens and lives on my camera most of the time... but when it breaks I'll get the 50 f 1.4... but for the price I could not say no :)"
4,"Good lens, once a good one is recieved.","This is a great lens for the price. Clear optics, fast speed, and light. Unfortunately the lens is not packed typical of all Canon lenses, with styrofoam, etc. Only a little bit of bubble wrap. Amazon has the habit of Not really packing lenses sufficiently. Long story short, I had to return the first two lenses, one due to shipping damage, another because of a factory defect. Other than these concerns, excellent lens for the money, and is making this photographer get addicted to prime lenses."
2,This is a fixed lense,I was disappointed that I could not use to take more close up shots. I need to reorder another lense from 18-55.
5,great starter lens,"The outside of the lens is plastic but for the price I'm alright with it. I haven't has the chance to try it out yet as the camera I ordered has not yet arrived, but from the footage I've seen I am very excited to use it."
2,Buyer Beware - GRAY MARKET ITEM,Buyers beware this product is GRAY MARKET and does not ship with warranty card! This lens is a Gray Market item should cost much less than listed. Look elsewhwere for USA warranty.
4,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for and you don't pay much for this lens, however, what you get for the price is surprising. If you can get past the cheap build quality you'll be pleased to find that this lens takes excellent quality photos. Shooting wide open (at f/1.8) gives you a wonderful blurred background and it's easy to achieve your depth of field goals with this little beauty. That said, I do find the auto focus to be a bit temperamental at times and do sometimes miss a shot having to refocus the lens. This wouldn't have been enough to deter me from the purchase though. For just under a hundred bucks it really is worth any little quirks and it lets you try out the feel of a prime lens without having to fork out the nearly five hundred dollars for the 50mm 1.4.Overall, very pleased and I think this lens is a steal."
5,As sharp as it gets,"Make no mistake, just because this lens is cheap doesnt mean it's not sharp. It's extremely sharp edge to edge on my 5D Mark II.The contrast is very high (perhaps a little less a full aperture) and it's unbotrusive, meaning you can take pictures with this and people don't feel""intruded upon"" as much.It's lightweight and will fit into your pocket.One of these fell out of my bag from a foot above the ground because someone was talking to me so much I didnt notice I had not closed the zip. Well in this caseit fell apart. So I've got proof it's not terrible solid. In fact the plastic is glued together. But the purchase of a new one did not set me back very muchand I was back in business.The alternatives are the wider aperture lenses which cost considerably more and are more solid. You can choose from Sigma and Canon, both are good, but do you really need that little extra light?"
2,Notice the common thread?,"Listen. I am likely to buy another one of these lenses, because they take EXCELLENT pictures. But when people talk about how flimsy the lens is, they aren't whistling dixie. I broke one of these lenses accidentally in a fluke accident that would not have damaged ANY of my other lenses. It's a problem because I'd gotten so used to using this lens it became my default. If you do happen to purchase this lens either be prepared to buy another one--and given that it is comparatively inexpensive this may not be a problem--or be prepared to really really care for it."
2,"Great glass, junk construction",I use mostly canon L-series glass. I was thrilled with the performance of this lens-- super sharp-- but dismayed when the lens rolled off my pelican case and fell 7 inches *onto carpet* and broke clean in two. Ridiculous. I've handled a earlier version (with a metal) mount that felt far more robust.
5,Best for the Money,"Images with this lens are RAZOR sharp, cant ask for more out of a lens. Would like it to have a metal mount, but for the money you cant complain... would have paid twice this if need be. Actually... I bought two. One for my father because he was so impressed with the lens: and he was a pro for 20 years shooting with only AT-X glass."
5,Canon 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lens Review,"This lens cannot be beat for the price. Everyone with a D-SLR should have this lens. Some complain about its build quality but it is the image quality I'm after. It is small enough to fit in any camera bag easily. Images are a bit soft at f/1.8, but are very sharp at f/2.8. It make a great portrait lens and it is also very good for BW photos with my 20D."
4,Good lens for the price,"Very good for portait, even in indoor dim light condition. Focusing will make a little noise though. But how can you blame it considering the price?"
4,Great Addition,"I'm so glad I got this lens. I feel inspired to try a variety of techniques with the great range of bokeh this lens provides. I'm a beginner ""photo hobbyist"" and I've only taken a couple hundred shots with this lens. Without a doubt this lens has made my hobby that much more fun. Had the lens for about a week now and I can only hope and knock on wood that all the negative reviews don't prove to be true for me, but I will certainly be back to give my 2cents if anything does go wrong. Great starter lens for low budgets. I can't give more than 4 stars simply because its not the f/1.2 lens, but great bang for the buck."
4,well worth the money!!!,"I was a little apprehensive when I bought this lens because it was so cheap, but after reading the product reviews which were almost all positive, I decided to give it a try! It is definitely well worth the money. Takes great portrait shots with or without playing around too much with camera settings. I am very pleased with this product!! The only thing that took some getting used to, is that you have to be a considerable distance away from your subject to avoid cutting parts of them out of the picture. GREAT LENS!!!"
5,"Great product, Great Seller",For the price this camera lense is worth it. Made of plastic not metal like the 1.4 but for the non insane photographer your not going to notice much difference.Seller got this product to me ridiculously fast.
5,Incredible product for this price,The difference between this and my regular Sigma 18-200 is incredible. This is a Must Have and the price is perfect. I love it more and more after 200 shots.
5,BUY AND HAVE FUN. PERIOD,"The reviews speak for themselves.Of course it's cheaply made. But the shots you get with this are WAY MORE WORTH than the 125 bucks you drop for this little miracle. Must have for kit-lens owners or low budget shooters and even pros.. why not?! There is NO reason NOT to buy this Lens.Buy it. End of discussion. You'll get hooked on this lens, promise!"
4,great lens,"I started out with the bog standard 18-55 canon lens that shipped with my EOS 1000D. I began getting frustrated that the quality of my photos were not as I wished them to be in terms of clarity and colour, espeially for food photography, even though I was sure I was working the camera properly. After purchasing this lens, my photos are a lot better immediately. and its great value for money."
4,Excellent lens. Do not use for video without a tripod.,"This is a great lens for stills. The only prime I would recommend over this as a first lens might be the 30mm.For video it is great, so long as you use a tripod. It has no image stabilization so handheld shots are unusable unless you are an unusually steady hand. I have not tried it with a rig yet, but its possible you can get suitable footage that was as well.The image quality is amazing at this price point. I couldn't find a cheaper lens to get started with that had the same quality image."
5,Good buy,"I bought my first DSLR (Canon Rebel T2i) in November 2010. This is the first lens (outside of the kit lenses) I've purchased for my camera and I'm pleased.It took me a while to get used to the fixed focal length - you have to move your body because the lens won't move. I find that I need to stand further away from people than normal to compose a portrait, but the image quality is worth it.I mainly purchased this lens for food photography and I'm very happy with the results. It performs well in natural light and low light, so it's great for food on my table at home or in a restaurant. It also creates that ""out of focus backround"" (bokeh) very well.I'm still learning about DSLR photography, but between reading books and purchasing this lens, my photos are much improved. You can't beat the price. I recommend this lens if you're just starting out and you want to have some versatility in your camera bag."
2,Cheaply made,"Okay. So I ordered this lens two weeks ago and I'm pretty sure I wore it out. It's plastic and very cheaply made. The lens literally fell apart. I would reccommend spending around $200 more and getting the 1.6 because it is made from metal and not plastic.I must praise the picture quality, though. I was very pleased with the detail that it picked up when the f-stop was low. The pictures were so clear and crisp. I really couldn't believe I got that quality from a $100 lens.In conclusion, this lens is cheap and will fall apart if you're a photographer that uses your camera everyday. But you do get what you pay for, image quality wise. Just note that it's extremely fragile and will break without you dropping, slamming, throwing, etc. I never even bumped mine on anything and it still fell apart."
4,sweet,"for 100 bucks it sure turns my canon vixia hf11 into a different machine. with the aid of an adapter i can now get that depth of field look i need. Be careful, its very easily breakable. broke mine first day, first hour. i read reviews on canon website that say the same. it has something to do with the way it is built were the focus ring is in an awkward position. after i reverse engineered it, the thing still works perfectly. I would recommend this to everyone in need of a good cheap pro lens, but please keep it in bubble wrap all the time."
4,"Great cost performance, but definitely cheap built quality","This was my second lens after the kit lens to my XTi. It is a fast lens and its cost performance is unbeatable. It definitely introduces new ways photos can be taken for beginners. f1.8 is awesome in low light situations.Pros:Great cost performance.Fast lens for the priceLight weightCons:Noisy and slow focusFocus ring is too slim and has no weight which makes it little more difficult to focus manuallyNot full time manual focusCheap built quality. After a while of use, I saw some dust inside the lens.Bokeh is not beautiful compared to more expensive Canon EF 50mm f1.4Overall, this lens is a great lens for beginners and its cost performance cannot be beaten. However, I have purchased EF 50mm f1.4 while after as not having full time manual focus was definitely not working very well for the way I take photos. Though f1.4 costs 3+ times f1.8, if you can afford it, I would recommend going for f1.4."
2,"Optically Fine, Poor Build Quality","I bought this lens for my daughter's Canon Rebel camera. Although I read the reviews and understood that the lens had questionable build quality, I concluded that for the price and given the Canon name, it would be ok for a teenager. Sadly, when I received it I was surprised to find it was almost entirely plastic... almost toy-like. After about 90 days, the lens became jammed on the camera and could not be removed. I have owned 4 Canon DSLR's and 10 EOS lenses and none have ever jammed in the camera mount like this. Ultimately, the plastic casing around the lens fell apart while we attempted to remove the lens. Very disappointing. I am sending it back, but I really don't want it replaced because the way it is built it will not hold up under any sort of field use. A minor bump will damage the casing around the lens."
4,Love this lens,"I bought this lens to use on my Rebel T3i and so far it works great. The portraits look great and I also like the bokeh produced. I have had no problems removing this lens as others have. My only complaint is that it does take awhile to focus sometimes and hunts around but for the price, it wont be a real loud complaint."
4,"Good, fast lens","Really impressed with the quality of the glass; always solid results.Pros: fast, affordable, good glass, good colorCons: plastic construction, feels a bit lightweightI've been using it regularly since August '11 without issue."
4,"Fast and light lens, great for the price","Well, for the money I spent this lens is wonderful. A little flimsy, as other reviewers have noted but almost heroic in its capacity for good pictures. I wouldn't take it on safari, but with the pop-up flash on my 40D this thing will take a passing portrait in a nearly dark room. The kit lens does not compare, speedwise. A drawback might be that when you really need the USM autofocus other lenses offer, this lens stutters a bit.All in all, a great value for the price and a handy one to have for low light photography. Be gentle, though! I don't think it would survive even a minor impact."
5,Love this lens,I absolutely love this lens. For $90 you can't go wrong and the pictures are just what I wanted. Nice and clear with the required depth of field and nice blurring in the background.
5,Outstanding!,"This lens is worth every cent and MORE! Super super sharp shots, great depth of field...good for a lot of different styles."
5,Great Buy!,"First,this is not a L series telephoto lens, but it is a fantastic prime lens for about $100!!! The construction is not real sturdy, and has a lot of plastic but for the money it is insanely great. Pictures are CRYSTAL clear and sharp. This is a great way to learn the lower f/ stops which is what I totally expected. The f/1.8 is more than enough to give you a ton of experience on what to be watching for. I missed focus on some secondary items in the picture due to setting the f/ stop too low, but that is my point, we need to learn by using a low f/ stop lens and this is a great way to learn. I also found that I will be looking much harder at prime lenses instead of zooms in the future. Without all of the compromises that zooms require, primes can get incredible sharpness! I have a lot of money in lenses, but this is the best bargain in my kit. And Amazon gave its usual great service on this purchase."
5,Fantasic lens for the money!,"This really is a fantastic lens for the money. I enjoy photography, but am not a professional by an means. This lens was a great purchase! It does not zoom, but since I usually am using the lens for a specific purpose that doesn't matter too much. The zoom would be nice, but for that feature you will pay a lot more. I highly recommend this lens!!"
4,Great Lens for my daughter to capture sweet smiles!,I bought this lens for my daughter to take close ups of the grands. She has a Cannon SLR EOS Rebel and she is satisfied. Good quality for the money. I get more face shots...quirky smiles and lots of grins. Good lens for an amateur just wanting pics for photo sharing scrap booking. Pictures are good for framing too. Compliments her other Canon lens.
4,great f/1.8 lens for the price,"this lens works great in low light situations, although [depending on your camera] photos look much grainier when set at 800+ ISO. but, since most f/1.8 lenses are several hundreds of dollars, this lens is great in it's simplicity and effectiveness."
4,Canon EF 50mm f/1.8,This is a good lens it is good for what it would be used for. For the price you can not get any better.
4,great inexpensive lens,"I'm just starting out in photography, so i'm not the source you should trust for expert reviews by any means, but this lens has been great for me to learn on.i didn't necessarily need a fixed lens, but i did want a low f-stop lens that i could play around with and practice on. this does exactly that.i think it produces pretty good pics, but again, i'm judging this on only a years worth of on and off photography w/ my T3ilike all the other kit lenses that i own, this one is very plasticy and light. this comes across as cheap....but then again, it's meant to be an inexpensive starter lens."
4,50mm f/1.8,I've only had the lens about a month. Seems like a good lens. One will need to brush up on their camera skills to use this lens properly. Pictures seem to be clear and with good color.
4,Worth the money,"Quality and construction are as expected for a lens of this price. The ability to take photos in low light and with shallow DOF are great attributes and add another facet to my photography.Without doubt it will not last forever and I will eventually upgrade to a more expensive 50mm lens(F/1.2 or F/1.4). For now, I am very pleased with this purchase and the opportunity to experiment and learn."
5,So Fresh So Clean So Cheap So Great,"Wow!!! For only $100, if you're really into portrait and blurry background, the 50 lens is what you need! NOWWW!!!"
4,"Good for the money, obviously not the quality of a f/1.4","The lens is really pretty cool, I use it with a digital Canon Rebel (10 megapixel) and can get some pretty neat shots with it. Some times in bright light or very low light it freaks out and won't get you a good picture, but that could be operator error too... I bought it to be able to obviously blur out backgrounds and it does that and for a cheap price, so its a good buy."
5,Awesome lens and works great with BULB feature!,"I think this lens is awesome and I wish I had purchased it sooner! I just received it today (ordered it 2 days ago) and was thrilled to test it out. I went ahead and bought the hood for the lens and a UV protector, so the whole setup cost about $105. I'm looking forward to using this lens by taking pictures of the stars (in the sky). Other reviews are right on about the build being a bit cheap, but so far I haven't had any issues and the hood was easy to attach to the lens/uv filter. $80 for a great lens = worth it! :)"
2,Low Quality,"This lens should only be purchased if your in a pinch. It is made mostly plastic, and has some focusing issues do to the poor quality. Don't get me wrong, it can definitely get the job done, but is best used as a back-up only. Spend the money, and get the f1.4 50mm."
3,Great product.. but....,"The lens works fine, is outstanding for low light conditions, the bokeh is stunning!Great for portrait.. it's as many of photographer say: a lens that everybody has to own""but..I can not understand how an expensive mark as Canon has a deficient Quality team.Did not realize that lens came with a rubber drop inside.. I guess the Quality team in Canon is blind( i realized of that drop, yesterday that took pictures at the airport,and there's a lot of lights comingso pics were kind of weird with strange flares)Checked the lens and realized of that drop, now? I will have to shoot only during days, becauseI won't send back a lens from COsta Rica to US..nothing to do..performance/quiality : 5 starsCanon : 3 stars ( deserves a 1 )"
5,great pictures!,I love this lens so much. very cheap and nice. but it is very fragile so dont drop it or it will most likely brake. :)
2,Fairly good lens but broke in less than a month,"I ordered this lens a few weeks ago and my 9 yr old camera took its first fall ever. It was probably at a height of 2.5 - 3.0 feet. The lens had a plastic lens hood on but even with this, the front part of the lens broke right off the rest of the enclosure. Lens hood was still intact, go figure.Good lens but easily breakable."
5,Heck of a buy!!!,"I've been pretty anxious for a camera upgrade (from my EOS Rebel XT), but I'm not yet financially capable of doing so. So I was looking for a lens that could enhance and improve image quality in the meantime. This lens did just that; it made a dramatic difference. The price made me doubt it's capabilities, but my expectations have been exceeded by far. The Canon EF 50mm lens is one heck of a buy!!!"
5,Love it!,"Great DOF, fast focus, very sharp, and best value for the price. I'm an amateur photographer and can't afford the expensive stuff quite yet. This lens is a must have for all photographers on a budget."
4,"Fast, Lightweight, Sharp, and EASY ON THE BANK ACCOUNT","The Canon 50mm f/1.8 is a lens that everyone should have! Works well with my Rebel XT. The build quality is fair at best, but it is excellent in low light situations. Sharp images, decent colors and focusing. With the price of this item being as it is, there is no reason not to have one in your bag! Great for portraits. THE BEST prime starter lens! Start with this one, then you can decide for yourself! You can't go wrong with purchasing this lens. FANTASTIC in low light! FANTASTIC on the bank account!"
5,LOVE this lens!,"I bought this lens in march to take on vacation and though it is a bit too close on my camera (Rebel series so it is more like an 85mm than a 50mm) for vacation photos, I LOVE it!It is a GREAT lens for portraits-fast and with good bokeh!it does sometimes have to hunt for focus (which is kind of a big deal at f1.8 and limited depth of field) but I usually solve that problem by setting my camera's focus to the specific spot I want it focusing on.I have never had problems with it getting stuck on any of my cameras (2 digital, one film) like other users have.I try to use this lens (vs my other lens-a sigma zoom) as often as possible because it is lightweight and takes great looking photos. the only problem (really the only CON this lens has for me) is that it is too narrow angle (at equivalent to 85mm) for some things. I am looking not getting a wide angle adapter for it but do not want to lose light so we'll see!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was a bit apprehensive given the quality remarks, but with all the glowing reviews I bought. I took the lens along on a recent vacation and found that I was using it for most of my shots based on the great results. I keep it protected when not in use, no big deal. The camera feels kinda of weird with such a short lens but the shots speak for themselves."
4,Great value,"Great value for this lens, I'd recommend the 50mm 1.4 for anyone shooting sports or action since it will focus faster using USM."
4,"By far, the best ""bang for your buck""","Because of price, I ordered this lens instead of the EF 50mm f/1.4 USM because that one was 3x the price of this one. While I still wish I had the more expensive lens, this f/1.8 50mm lens captures some amazing photos for me and I couldn't be more pleased. It works great on my Digital Rebel XTi.If all you have is the kit lens that came with your camera body, you owe it to yourself and your camera to spend the $70 to get this lens. You will be amazed...your pictures will finally come to life. It does take some getting used to not being able to zoom in/out, but the low fixed aperture ability that this lens has is what gets you the sweet shots."
5,Great lens & great price!,"This lens maybe plastic and all, but it takes great pictures. I hardly have to edit my photos now. The color are vibrant, images are clear and sharp, and does a great bokeh. Just what I was looking for! Keep in mind, try not to change lens so much. Overall, I love this lens and the price!"
3,"Not bad, Front Focusing Issue","There's alot of hype over this lens based on it's cost to performance ratio. For such a cheap price, it really does well. My copy however had front focusing issues. At lower f-stops, which front focusing is not as much an issue, the images were still somewhat soft for my taste. With studio lighting it does very will, and is very sharp. I would recommend this lens to anyone starting out. It's a great lens to practice with. Just check and make sure that it doesn't have any focusing issues. I sent mine back because of it."
4,Decent lens,"I bought this lens with my new Canon Rebel XT. It was recommended by one of my friends and I thank him very much for letting me know this beauty. It works very well for indoor portrait shooting and I got quite some nice photos for my baby.Only one thing worries me a bit. It doesn't look like it is going to hold on for a long time. But with $70 something as the price, I know I should't expect too much."
4,Canon EF 50 mm f/1.8 II Lens,"Cheap build it has; but it does do a great job as a normal lens. Images are excellent. (Amazon had a good price too.) I probably should have purchased this lens with the Rebel XTi rather than opt for the kit lens; and later put that money into a great lens like perhaps the 70-200 f/4 L, or a wide angle. The only reason I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 is the narrow manual focus ring; just a a little bit awkward to handle located at the end of the lens."
4,"For this price, you can't go wrong.","Not much to say about this lens. It's clear and light. It really can't be beat for the price. The focus is a little slow but for $70 I can't complain. If I had money to blow, I'd probably go with the 50mm f/1.4 for the better focusing."
4,Canon Lens review,"I bought this lens for my husband for his birthday and he loves it! It came on time and in perfect condition. I don't know much about these lenses or anything, but he is very happy with it."
5,Thrifty 50!!,"Excellent for the price, excellent optics with a decent but poor build quality which was done for a reason to make this lens so affordable. If your on a budget thanthis is a great add on to your kit. Everyone should own own!"
5,Canon 50mm 1.8,"The lens is the truth !!! As I was making plans to purchase my Canon 50D, my fellow Canon enthusiast highly suggested the Canon 50mm(Nifty-Fifty)as a prime lens. I took some test shots in low lighting and boy did this lens come through. It has great sharpness and color, and I would recommend it to anyone, and not mention, the price was right."
4,very good lens for its price,"If you are looking for a portrait lens, with reasonable price. This is the one for you.Gives decent quality pictures, for a beginner it makes the perfect choice for portraits"
4,Good for the price.,"I've been very happy with the quality of picture that I am obtaining with this lens. Excellent depth. I still need to play around with using it with a flash, though, my pictures often end up washed out.It's been well worth it.Only complaint (minimal) is that it often refocuses onto something besides my primary object/person. If my child moves a hand, it'll bring the hand into focus and blur my child in the background."
3,works nice,"ok, I got this lens because of all the great reviews. I worked good, it didn't seem as sturdy as the original Canon lens. I also know you get what you pay for so besides that it did work well. It took crisp, clean shots. It is a good lens for the price but it was to close to the lens I had already so I did send it back. It isn't that great for super close up work. When you got to close it couldn't focus & it sounded very loud when it was trying to. I would recommend this lens if you were just looking for a general lens not for getting to close to the subject."
5,Best $100 you'll spend on your EOS camera.,"For $100 this glass is probably the best deal Canon has to offer. It's sharp as a tack and excellent in low light. Keep in mind this is no USM lens and it's fairly noisy. With a DSLR 1.6x crop this becomes 80mm and is the perfect candid lens: There is no need for flash as it's very bright, it's also very discreet on a camera, making you look less like you're trying to zoom up some poor victim's nostrils. I think anyone with an EF mount should own this lens regardless of what you're shooting."
4,Great lens,"This a really nice lens. It works amazingly with sunsets and the sun spots and glares look truly spectacular with it. The only reason I could not give it a five star rating is because there is no zoom for this lens, which means a LOT of walking in and out and still not being able to get as close to the subject as you would like to. I also find that it is extremely hard to focus on the face of your subject. It does not work well with multiple subjects because it doesn't focus well on all of the subjects. However, all in all it is a pretty great lens once you get used to using it. You should definitely have one of these in your camera bag. Very reasonable price."
2,Help me anybody,i ve just set it on my canon 550 D and autofocus doesnot work ! what the hell is going on
5,What to say,"I needed a fixed 50mm and this thing does the job VERY WELL, it is true what they all say about it, its a champ and a GREAT price for it too!"
5,Great inexpensive lens,I got a new Canon 40d and wanted to get a couple of extra lens with out breaking the bank. I wanted a better low light lens then I had.I lessoned to reviews from some well known Photography Professionals and all said that a 50mm f/1.8 lens is one of the lenses to pick up.I did and I'm totally happy with it. Great low light photos and ever so light on the camera.I think any body would be totally happy with this lens as well.It is plastic lens with great glass which shoots great photos. That's what we are all looking for. Try it you will be happy with it.!
5,Love this little lens!,This lens is an excellent little one! Pictures have beautiful bokeh! I would buy again if I had too! The lens has held up so far so good and I've had it a few years!
4,Good Things In Small Packages,"I was advised about this lens by the local newspaper photo chief. He said that with all of his lenses, this was the one that he continued to use for pictures where you want a balance between the context and the subject. I have lenses of every size and shape. Recent trip to Glacier NP convinced me that this is the base lens to use. It gives you a basic picture and works well for landscapes, group pictures, and pictures. The plastic is a little cheap (Come on, Canon, spring for the metal!!) and I still use the plastic and bubble wrap for transport in my backpack. For your basic lens with a wide angle, this is the answer."
5,nice lense,I got this lense because I thouth It would help with low light enviroments and it does.though you will definitly need a tripod for realy low light shooting in order to increase the aperture time.I don't really care much about bokhee but it's nice.the only problem I find is that the 50mm focal distance on a croped sensor camera like the T3i is really an 80mm. if you are looking for a more true to life image area on a croped sensor it would be something arround 30mm and that as far as I know costs 3 times more so it's up to you.
2,Broke 1 Month After Warranty Expired!,"I bought the lens last April and it sat in my camera bag until last weekend. After a year, I decided to finally use it and just a week of use the auto-focus no longer works!! I will say, the pictures it can produce are great, but if you like auto-focus look elsewhere!"
5,Cannot buy a sharper lens for the money!,"Don't be fooled by the price of this lens. This is one of the few lenses that is ""cheap"" and tack sharp. It is all plastic but what do you want for under $100. It makes a great portrait lens and I love the shallow depth of field at f/1.8. I'm sure Canon's 50mm f/1.4 is great but if you don't have $250 to drop on it you'll be very happy with the 1.8. And if it breaks just buy a new one, it is a third of the price of the 1.4."
1,Hanson is DEFINITELY COPYING The Moffatts!,"Hanson is copying The Moffatts. ""This Time Around"" sounds like Misery. They should just stay with their love songs. The Moffatts decided to do a more rock edge than pop was to have more fans. Hanson has enough fans. They should stick to what their good at."
5,"Coming back stronger, this time around","I loved the single ""This time around"" the first time I heard Hanson perform it live on @mtv week, and also the song ""If Only."" Both were great and I am so happy to see that they have improved both vocally and instrumentally. ""Love song"" is amazing, my brother who doesn't usually like Hanson walked into my room wondering who it was and when I told him it was Hanson he was amazed. It is rare to hear Isaac sing a solo, and I am so glad he did because he has a great, sensual voice. The enhanced part of the album is cool too, you get to see part of the ""If only"" video and some interviews. I look forward to their new album, and if it sounds anything like these songs, then it will be a must buy!"
5,This Time Around...,"If you don't like Hanson, and perhaps you are still dreading another 'Mmmbop', fear not. These guys are back, and in a time were the BSB and NSync reign, these guys are ready to show them whose boss. With a guitar charged chorus, smooth piano intro, and out-standing and profound lyrics ""This Time Around"" should be come one of the defining songs for Hanson's career. You can tell by listening to ""This Time Around"" the boys have taken their long break, and learned all they could. ""Love Song"", also on the new album due out May 9th, is sweet and solid with luring instrumentation that wraps you up and floats you away. I predict a long and steady future for these three multi-talented guys. :o)"
1,STOP KILLING HIP-HOP!!!!!!!!,"With Graduation by Kanye West, Curtis by 50 Cent and American Gangster by Jay-Z the nails in the coffin of Hip-Hop are being firmly hammered down.The fact the people can find any redeeming features in any of the tracks contained on these appalling Albums is beyond me. All I can do is list some real Hip-Hop Albums that prove that quality lives on and mediocrity simply falls away into obscurity.TUFF CREW -BACK TO WRECK SHOPN.W.A - 'Efil4Zaggin'HEAVY D - BLUE FUNKMAIN SOURCE - BREAKING ATOMSSON OF BAZERK - Bazerk, Bazerk, Bazerk"
5,His songs make me happy.,"Even if all the songs don't have the deepest lyrics, they work. I just love him. This is a really upbeat CD and it's definitely great for driving, playing video games, hanging out, anything. It puts me in a great mood."
1,I'm tired of hearing this album already,"What can I say about this album. I will never understand what the hype is about Kanye. I get tired of hearing how great his album is because he sampled some obscure band from the 80s. Lets talk about Kanye's rapping talent. The rhymes on Can't Tell Me Nothing remind me of some white kids ""rapping"" in their cafeteria. ""I feel pressure, under more scrutiny, And I do, What act more stupidly?"" Under more scrutiny, Kanye should work harder not to make whack rhymes. For an artist that's fan base talks about his humility and internal strife, Kanye does nothing but declare himself God and announce his greatness on the ""hit"" Stronger. I hope this is the last of the trilogy. Maybe now that Kanye is graduated his next contribution will be ""Getting a Real Job."""
1,Is there any excuse for more tired music like this?,Another example of hype creating a space around this album like it is the best thing since sliced bread. It could have come out ten years ago and it would still have been tired. Lame.
3,over rated,i think rap music is so trash the first decent rapper to hit the scence{which is not kanye} there gonna go crazy. people are so use to 1 and 2 hit wonder albums if you give them 4 songs that are good on an album there bite. so even though theres 14 songs on an album they can listen to 4 over and over again thats good.
3,awful! - ETA - I retact my awful and will say it doesn't suck.,"I really like Kanye, and I thought Late Registration and College Dropout were 2 of the best hip-hop CD's I've heard in a long time.But this???? Terrible. I can't find one good thing to say about it.ETA: Ok, I listened to it again and there at least 3 good songs on here. So I did find one good thing to say. Still not nearly as good as his first 2, but not terrible."
1,not good,I purchase this cd because i was told it was good. it was no song i could really dance too all the beats on the cd was slow and made me sleepy..
3,Ehh.....,"sick beats, as expected.weak lyrics, as expected.I never knew Kanye was a ""genius"" nowadays, and was in the ""top 5 of all time."" I'm not a big fan of the arrogance, especially when it's not backed up...Kanye reminds me of a big chunk of fool's gold."
1,LAME,This album was wack i copped that Curtis it was on Fire a couple club bangers and girly songs but that sells to the females go get Curtis it has way sicker flows then Kon G ay fest could come up with it definitly a bootlegger hahaha
4,Surprising good,"Great cd i have 2 admit i never been much of a Kanye West fan at all but if it wasn't for my boy telling i should pick this album up i never would have but im glad that i did because this album was a big surprise to me. The tracks the i like the best are ""Everything I Am"" & ""The Glory"" nice beats and nice flow. I have 2 admit i really like this album and i recommended it to all my boys and they all went and got it and not one of them were dissappointed. The album is a must in any cd collection"
2,Eh,"When Kanye West first started out, I thought he had a lot of potential to be a decent and credible artist. He was new and fresh, plus I thought he had quite a few catchy songs. Nevertheless, I don't feel that way anymore. Kanye West just seems like an a s s hole, plain and simple. He's extremely arrogant and think's he's the best rapper who's ever gotten signed. Bottom line, is that he let the fame and money get to his already enormous head. In my opinion, the singles he's put out on ""Graduation"" aren't very unique or different from anything else that's out there right now. Granted, I have not purchased the album nor have I ever attempted to listen to it. But why would I? If the best songs that are on the album are the ones that are playing on the radio right now, then I'm not going to waste my time or money to hear the rest of it."
1,boo,"i was really excited to get this album, but after first listen through, i'm really disappointed. the only decent song on there is ""stronger"".sure, there might be some decent lyrics/messages on other tracks, but they're not fun to listen to and they're certainly nothing to rock out to, like much of kanye's other two albums.i'm sorry i bought this album."
2,Dissapointing....,"I bought this because I bought 808's and heartbreak and loved it!but was extremely dissapointed when i bought thisHis flow and lyrics are just garbage for the most partthere are a few good songsHomecoming- a flawless songGood Life- wouldve been good but got outplayed on the radioDrunk and hot girls- love the hook but then it gets boringBarry Bonds- decent...Stronger- i guess...and thats about it, i cant even remember any more songs off that albumI suggest you buy 808's and heartbreak"
2,very disappointed,"this album is by far kanyes worst. yes, the beats are amazing as usually but kanyes flow and lyrics are absolute garbage. stronger is a good song but is ruined by the fact that he is rapping about klondikes. there are very few good songs on this album and none of them are even close to being college dropout material. once again, i cannot emphasize enough how bad the lyrics are. kanye should stick to producing."
2,"Pfffft, whatever get some real hiphop instead","Its aight, some of it is really lame and pop techno BS, some of it is tight, all of it is ""not that great"" It is a shame that he is selling so many albums while so many real hip hop artists with more talent don't sell anywhere near this; go out and buy the new Pharoahe Monch album!"
3,Don't Believe The Hype,"When I watch Kanye perform its like he's performing a different song in his head than the one I'm hearing and watching. He's jumping around like he's elevating our minds with lyrics similar to ""Get Up Stand Up"" but I'm watching a hyper-active kid running back and forth across the stage chanting ""Ole McDonald"" to a decent musical arrangement, with back-up singers who are clearly related to someone in his entourage, and all arranged like it was a first time impromptu performance. ""Ee Aye Ya'll. Ee Aye! Ain't nobody puttin lyrics down like this! Ya'll don't even recognize the significance of what ya'll are hearin' right now!""""You can live through anything if Magic made it!""This is one of the many examples of why it is a mistake to listen to hip hop for anything more than ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY!To be fair he deserves respect for his determination in pursuing his goal of being a successful rapper/producer because he did achieve it."
5,Damn!!! Kanye did it again.,This is his best work! Kanye is the best out right now! I love this album. Kanye puts his heart and soul into his stuff! I love it.
3,Stronger,"First single is amazing. I just wish the rest of the album was a little bit ""Stronger."" Kanye is amazing. I feel like his music is really about something...not the frivolous nursery rhyme/gimmick crap. But I have to admit I skipped through alot of this album on the first listen. Maybe I have ADHD, but if you don't catch me in the first 30 seconds then I'm movin' on."
4,cool album,"It's your boy J-RE! (artist). This album is cool man, real cool. I like the transition of this album. The previous albums were great, the only thing i didn't like about those albums were the 50 million skits. With this album, there's no skits, just pure raw heat. The beats are tight and Kanye's flow is tight. I really can't say anything negative about this album. Kanye is a different type of artist with a different type of flow. You really can't compare him to other artists, cause he'e different. And that's why I like him because he is an artist, and that's what art is about. He clearly expressed his art on this album and I look forward to hearing his transition in the future. Cool album! Albums like this, keep Hip Hop Alive. It's your boy J-RE!"
4,Awesome,"I love underground Hip Hop...None of that garbage on Mtv or The Radio and I never really gave Kanye a chance..I figured he was just another bogus mainstream rapper but wow I gave this a listen and I'm really impressed...Good uplifting lyrics, great style, alot of good simple beats too, none of that overly poppy club garbage...Kanye is Real. College Dropout is a great LP also..."
2,"POP is now ""rap""??!!","I'll agree on some of the production, but even that's as edgy as Britney Spears.They way this album was hyped, I expected so much more. eh *shrug*"
4,Consistently releasing good material,"Once i knew Kanye was set to drop on the same day as fiddy, i knew there was no way in hell i was purchasing 50's cd... the only thing left was to see if one of my favorite rapper/producers would finally fall victim to lack of ideas... i'm glad to say he didn't disappoint!! While it's not his best work (College Dropout), i still found this to be a good listen. My Criteria is simple... your cd needs to be good for a complete listen through, meaning no skipped songs... the more songs i skip, the worse the cd is!My favorite song is no doubt ""Stronger""... i'm also feeling ""Barry Bonds""... although that took a while to grow on me... and i can't forget the heart felt tribute to Jayz, ""Big Brother""!All in all, worth buying!"
4,Crazy Album!!!,"This album is pretty dope...its mos def the winner of the ""50 vs kayne"" I only heard one track that wasnt any good...the rest were either decent or Great!!!! Pick this one up...way better then the 50 CD."
1,Incredible talent!,This guy is amazing. He actually steals other people's music and puts it over a repetitive beat and passes it off as his own! WOW! GENIUS!!
3,Keepin it fresh!!!,"No doubt a polished album, the production is on point and the beats are dope. Kanye continues to run the line between street cred and the mass appeal.Kanyes personality shines through on this one -he sticks to his style, and hasn't tried to take on a different persona which several rappers tend to do-- quite honestly he doesnt need too, the man is larger than life. The overall feel is an upbeat positive one which is consistent with the graduation theme.Lyrically I was a little disappointed after his previous efforts.It just seems like Kanye ain't trying that much on this one. Not as clever as his previous works but all in all Kanye is still keeping it fresh, and this album is worthy to add to your collection.'Graduation' will outsell 50's 'Curtis'!My Top Five:Everything I Am (classic!)ChampionGood LifeBarry BondsFlashing Lights"
5,Graduation- best album yet!!,"Graduation is an amazing cd!Kanye West is one of the best (the best id say) artists out there right now, and his first two albums i thought were great, but this one knocks even his previous ones out of the box. With each new cd he matures and refines his music. Every song has something that i love in it. 50's cd Curtis.....i believe people bought it because of the hype, and when i listened to a friends cd, i wasnt surprised that i was only okay.Even my boyfriend who LOVES 50 said he was really dissapointed, and his other cds were much better. My favorite songs on Graduation right now excluding his singles are: flashing lights (soon to be another single i hope), i wonder, and the glory. ""Top 5 mc's u aint gotta remind me, top 5 mc's u gotta rewind me, im high up on the line u can get behind me, but my heads so big u cant sit behind me"""
2,I don't get what the big deal is,"The stuff on this album is ok, but it doesn't seem to be anything all that different or that much better than the hip hop or rap from the past. I guess he should get extra points for not promoting the thug life like many artists in his genre do. This sounds like compentent stuff, but I just don't hear anything that's blowing my mind here. Kinda makes me yawn when compared to the old school stuff. I mean, great for him that he's selling tons of records, etc. But so did Britney Spears, so obviously that's not a sure sign of artistic merit on its own.I can only assume that those who continually use the word ""genius"" when talking about West are simply buying into his press hyperbole as much as he is himself."
4,A must buy,"I see all of the negative reviews and I wonder what kind of music are they listening to. To be quite honest, there is not a lot of good hip hop out there. By far I believe that he is creating original concepts with his music.There are 2 songs that I am not really feeling, but who cares? They arent wack, they just arent for me. Get the album and see for yourself. It is worth the money."
2,Will someone please give this so-called genius a hand,"And the winner between 50 cent & Kanye is neither: Both albums suck! Kanye's album is slightly better than 50 cent but that aint saying much. Well its now official, all the good hip hop is coming from the underground. The tagline for Graduation Day album should read: ""An album so weak it needs help off of the turntable""BTW: You know what this album needed? More cowbell"
4,Thnx Fr Th Mmrs,"26th October 2007, Dubai Media City! Try imagine The Beatles' concert in the 60s, Bob Marley's in the 70s or Michael Jackson's in the 80s. I never had an NBA ticket for a Chicago game in the mid 90s... but this time, the dream came true! I bowed in the presence of Greatness; Kanye West! Well, lost my assets there but the tragic accident could not prevent me from spitting ""Jesus Walks"". I felt like Zachary up in that tree, above the agitated crowd eager to attend his graduation...Graduation - Top credits1. Everything I Am2. Can't Tell Me Nothing3. Flashing Lights4. Big Brother5. Champion/The Glory"
5,still hot...,"he has proved himself to be even better than before, i like this one...fly muzik, vibe and everything in between..."
3,Typical Kanye,"I have never bought a Kanye West CD before; or many at all, for that matter. Usually I just download music on my computer, but thought this CD would be worth my while. Mr. West is definitely one of my favorite rappers. With that said, I was quite disappointed with the songs on this album; that I have not yet heard on the radio... He actually tries to sing on certain tracks. To put it nicely, he really must stick to rapping. The album art, I think once again by Murakami, is wonderful. I gave this CD review 3 stars because I do love love love his craft, but would suggest listening to the songs before you choose to buy. Whenever I listen to the CD, I fast forward through half of his tracks."
1,"If you can, bootleg it so you won't waste your money","Well I was looking for something spectacular like Late Registration and you know what? This cd was so far from it. I think I must have skipped the first three cuts and then a couple more until I got to a song that was even decent. Mind you there's only 13 tracks so not much of a cd. I don't see how anyone can hype this up. Fifty's cd is a lot better. And to think that I bought this cd. Fifty's cd isn't like the first one he dropped no or the Massacre but it still tops this cd hands down. No doubt the guy has talent improving beats, but only with samples of other peoples stuff. Anyone that is over 30 would know this. I thought I was a kid again in the 80's because of all the samples he had on here. And as far as his lyrics!! Well I have heard better on the street corner. Much better. In my opinion this cd should be called, freshman because he should have made this cd before the others. Maybe it would appear like he progressed."
1,an insult to real hip-hoppers,"Kanye West is an insult to real hip-hoppers everywhere. What he does best is buy a track from an established artist like Steely Dan or Daft Punk and then lamely rap over it. Or get the guy from Coldplay to sing along. The result is a CD that reaches the crossover market of people who can't wrap their minds around the the true creative artists in the form. What they get is soothing and familiar Rap Pop. Kanye is the James Blunt of rap. Expand your horizons, people. Browse the hip-hop section and thrill to something fresh and new."
5,Love KanYe!,"We ordered the CD because my husband had to have the artwork. We love the music and the art! Don't really like the eco-friendly paper cover though, they never last. But what's inside is pure magic!"
4,"As usual, great beats, bleh lyrics","As usual the beats are top of the line. But, like many reviewers have said, his lyrics are lacking inspiration on this album, its all style with his delivery but the actual words are terrible.Anyway, by beats alone, except for two songs I think every song could be a single on this album.Pros: Of course, excellent beats, great art work, Kanye's style, a lot of great songsCons: Except for ""Big Brother,"" Kanye's lyrics are technically subpar and lacking in inspiration. Also, the album is pretty short, it left me wanting more."
4,Does anybody make real ish anymore?,"Kanye does. If you know someone who loves music, but doesn't love Graduation, their issue is with the artist, not the art. The art cannot be denied. Kanye flat out makes great music. It's been a lot of years since I heard a hip hop song and went searching all over to find the original song that was sampled. This CD has several songs like that. Take a welcome break from tough guy posturing and drug sales and just enjoy music for a while. You won't be disappointed."
3,Kanye is a better producer then he is a lyricist.,"After two amazing solid hip hop albums just recently released this year, Common's Finding Forever and Talib Kweli's Eardrum, (both in which had an appearance with Kanye) one could only look foward to the next big album. This album was Kanye's Graduation. Unfortunately, this album was a mixed bag for me. As a producer, Kanye is one of the greats and he undeniably will be one of the best for some time to come. As a lyricist, I was definitely disappointed. Kanye is still better then most, but for this album I felt he didn't bring his A game. After hearing Common's and Talib Kweli's albums, this one seem very lackluster in the lyrical department. Either way, this is easily one of the best hip hop albums this year surpassing 50's Curtis."
2,I'm not cool enough for Kanye,"If you want an average CD, with minimal character in the lyrics, and some alright beats, you've found it. This album proves to me that it's time for Kanye to get back behind the tables and let the MCs do their thing and let him do his thing, which is produce. We will have to wait for Murs and Moka Only and Atmosphere to break onto radio before Hip-Pop can be a legitimate art form again and draw some market share back from country music."
3,Ego maniac,"I gave it 3 stars since some of the song's have good musical arrangments that West should only stick to since his rap skills are somewhat... I dunno, not too good. This album and 50 Cent's are nothing spectacular, atleast this is somewhat creative compared to this whole ""gangsta"" ""thug"" image mainstream rap music pocesses. Brainwashing this generation into a bunch of materalistic, consuming drones, which is sad. Soulja boy? T-Pain? Lil Boosie? Mainstream rap/hip hop music is in a state of denial."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS YOU'VE HEARD,"I believe that this album is a little over-hyped. In the late 90's people jumped all over Puff Daddy for sampling and not being original and rhyming very weak. Now in 2007, we have a new Puff Daddy. Seriously, on every song he samples another song, and then raps weakely on it. What's the difference? On this new album there are some songs that are darn right laughable. I will also admit that there are some good songs on this album as well, but this time around, the bad outweigh the good. I consider this a very average album."
3,3.5 stars all day long,"Kanye is back at it with his third effort. Creative rhymes and dope beats are what kanye has cooked up for the world to listen for his third attempt. Stand out songs like ""everything I am"", ""good life"", and ""barry bonds"" help to make this album a easy favorite in my cd changer. I give this album 3.5 stars due to the fact there are a few weak songs that I skip routinely. Like for instance ""Drunk and hot girls and I wonder"" are terrible songs to me. I don't like the energy nor the delivery of the rhymes on these songs. While this isn't a perfect album.....After listening to 50's album, Graduation comes off as a masterpiece."
2,marginal album,"i just don't feel this album at all. Kayne West is a Marginal Rapper and his beats and overall Grooves feel like alot of the Production and tracks that are getting played today which have a 80's feel. that works some times and other times it feels cold and leaves alot of soul out of the sound. Kayne Lyrically is a Pop reference style of rapper. he is catchy at times,but more often than not he just doesn't hold my attention for more than a few tracks. there isn't really a standout track to me,but more of a few catchy tracks than a actual song that knocks me out. this album feels in alot of ways as another part of the previous two for better or for worse."
2,Disappointing,"I will always enjoy Kanye for his artistry, but unfortunately this album just falls short. The songs have no replay value and his beats & lyricism are becoming predictable. Hopefully his fourth release will be much more enjoyable."
4,Amazing what a little Originality can do!,"While hip hop may not be my favorite style of music. Kanye has always seemed to be exceptional to my ears. His appreciation of pop music andfearless use of various genre's for his dubs alone makes him memorable.Minimalist production but killer beats rule and while I prefer 'Late Registration' I hesitate to say which is better. This guy is still evolving and Im diggin the ride. Solid four star effort. Jay-Z mustbe proud. As for Curtis, no suprise there as his stylistic limitationsare obvious. Word.hcw"
3,Dope diploma,"3 1/2Some of West's most compelling, albeit highly synthesized samples to date are enough to keep things fresh, though the constant self-absorption via weak delivery can grow tiresome."
4,My son likes the CD,"I purchased the CD for my son and he likes it. Although I would not have purchased the CD if it had been after the awards when Kanye West humiliated Taylor Swift when she was given her award. Besides that, we like the CD just fine."
1,Absolute slap in the face!!!,"If you like any of the true artists on this album or love any of the songs listed, you will be in disgust when you listen to this album. While listening to this album I am reminded of bar bands doing covers of other bands with little or no practice. The result is this album. An album of complete covers that sound nothing like the true, perfectly perfomed, songs of the true perfomers. I really didn't expect much but I EXPECTED MORE THAN THIS. My suggestion is to stay away from this album. The Beastie Boys would be so disappointed."
2,Defective at 14 months,"I was attracted to the many cool features of this product, and it worked well until 2 months after it's warranty expired. Then suddenly the audio signal went to one-channel only, with lots of distortion and intermittent total interruptions, i.e. it is unlistenable. I paid >$100 for this thing. It was not worth it. Unacceptable product life."
3,Died after 16 months of use.,"I have used my F790 almost daily, mainly for listening to FM, but occastionaly listening to files and using the voice recording. Everything worked flawlessly for 14 months, then the mode button stopped working, so I was stuck in FM only. Then a month later I would get intermittant drop outs of the sound for a few seconds every hour or so. A month after that it one day would not power on."
4,Great new idea for chick lit - a hair salon!,"I love chick lit and this was such a refreshing change from the usual ... this is chick lit in a hair salon! I like that the author is also a star colorist married to an acclaimed stylist. Makes everything more real. She ""knows"" all the ins and outs of hair salons. I gave it 4 stars because at first it read more like a teen book, but then it kind of came around to me and I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I will definitley read this author again. I recommend this book to all chick lit lovers!"
4,a surprisingly good read,"This is a charming book, with elements of Trigiani. I would recommend, particularly if you've spent any time in New York City."
2,I've read better.,"I actually couldn't bring myself to finish this. The issue wasn't the plot or dislikeable characters, I just found the writing to be redundant. It really made the hair world seem boring. If she was trying to disect the upper class of American society, like Julien Fellowes did in ""Snobs"" for Britain, ""Beyond the Blond"" lacked depth. I guess that even though the author was trying to convey the ugly side of beauty, its deeper meaning fell short and it remained ambivalent, gossipy and superficial in its tone.Also, I had a hard time with the time line. During ""Farah Fawcett"" hair and Studio 54 days, the main character was 16 and about 6 or seven years later, people had cell phones and were getting botox. This really didn't make any sense to me.Overall, if you are looking for a book with a bit of analytical gossip, I would recommend ""Snobs"" because this book did not live up to its title."
2,oscar's fire's luke warm,"Oscar Lopez's first cd was an incredible display of flamenco virtuosity. His sophomore effort displayed none of the fire of his initial effort but at least demonstrated his guitar skills. This, his third outing, continues a downward spiral. Not only is the guitar work uninspired, but, as if realizing his own lackadaisical input, the mix relegates Oscar to a sometimes barely audible, subservient position. There is very little heat and no fire in this cd."
1,not plus size,i am a about a 2/3x and i always order a size up in tights. the crotch didnt even go past my knees :(
2,RUN VERY SHORT...NOT FOR TALL LADIES,"These tights are NOT for tall people! They reached my knees & I'm 5'10""! I gave them to a friend of my 14 year old daughter & ended up wearing a pair of solid black tights. I don't see how these would EVER fit a plus 3x/4x...there's just NO WAY"
2,Plus size?,"No way are these 3/4x. Maybe a skinny person's idea of what 3/4x might be. Aside from being small, they were really cute. Gave them to my size 10 friend, who is getting a lot of use out of them."
3,Not For Tall People,"I was happy with the general fit of the tights, however I was very disappointed as to how short they were. They worked for what I needed them for but a combination of the short rise and the loose waist (they are not control top) left me yanking them up more frequently than I would have liked. I am 5'11"" and if these tights were just a few inches longer they would have earned 5 stars from me."
1,Ugh!,This is the worst college textbook I have ever read. It is dry and difficult to read. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. The frustrating part is that the subject matter is actually quite interesting but the way the book is written would make anyone want to RUN from all topics addressed here. For the writers: Even college intellects want to read interesting subject matter written in an applicable style that helps the reader process what's written. Geez.
4,"Great if you have arthritis, not as classy looking as I hoped","This is excellent as far as ease of use. It opens and closes with very little effort which is important to me as I have arthritis. In the pictures, the ""leather grain vinyl"" looks classier and I thought it was a lower gloss. I had dreamed of a binder like this that also looked classy and upscale, but it this is a bit more of a conventional shiny binder."
3,One of the two I received is broken,"Not bad. But I suggest next time you order from Amazon, you remind them to check before delivery."
5,it looked cool,"after buying many jfk books from amazon, it appeared under items i might like. i figured what the heck.i had it within 3 days...awesome service.my wife even let me hang it in the kitchen (and she's a republican)."
4,Ranch Womens Manuel,"This is an excellent ""tongue-in-cheek"" factual account of ranch life, told in the style of Erma Bombeck. Ms. Petersens versions of events and the trials and tribulations of the American Ranch Wife are hysterically funny and guarenteed to cast a new light on the Farmers of America! Great gift or just a light, enjoyable read!"
5,Great performance,"I use the BP-945 in my Canon XH-A1. It provides much better life than the stock battery, and charges on the same charger.Not much more to say - it's a great buy, and it will get you from point A to point B without having to worry about running out of battery life. A great buy!"
4,Great Product,"The Canon BP-945 works great, No complain. It is always best to buy a genuine batterie, plus it last almost twice longer than the BP-930."
5,Bought used : Works like new,"I've had experience with this type of battery before, but never owned one until now. I bought used on Amazon to save a little money. The battery charges and works just like I would expect it to"
5,Got rid of the cord,This battery has allowed me to do some filming without the need to plug the camcorder in all the time. I can go for hours between charges.
5,"Great batteries,",Purchased from camera_world for $49.These were authentic Canon batteries in original packaging. They work great and I have put them through many cycles. They hold up terrificly.
3,"good for graduate level, but otherwise...","This is not a book for beginners. While the subject is covered thouroughly, there are virtually no examples on the usage of the equations and formulas. Perhaps I simply had a poor teacher but I feel that this book was written with the intention of being used as a reference book for graduate level students. I would recommend any undergrad assigned this book for class try to find a supplementary book from which examples and problems may be worked."
2,Just OK book,"This book is very wordy. Often, there are only 1 or 2 at the most examples per chapter, but most of it narrative. Additional books are requred in order to solve numerical problems."
2,the weakest Morse of all....where Lewis?,"instead of sergeant lewis helping an ill Morse solve a case that is 140 years old, there is a new copper name kershaw. i forgot the name of the actor who played kershaw yet i don't care because he is so bloody awful. once kershaw enters the picture, THE WENCH IS DEAD goes downhill. as always, john thaw is fine as morse. hey, sgt lewis is in the novel. he is mentioned once in the tv movie but nowhere to be seen. perhaps kevin whately (as lewis) was too busy making another popular UK tv series ""Peak Practice"" where he plays a doctor. thankfully whately and john thaw reunite for the final Morse film THE REMORSEFUL DAY. see it instead and forget THE WENCH IS DEAD."
1,Bought for Mother In Law,"I have no clue how good or bad this item is. I bought it for my Mother In Law who loves Waylon Jennings. Personally, I don't like any country music."
2,A must have.,"Love love love having this item. I live out in town in Misawa Japan, not on the base so my voltage is Japanese. I bought a slow cooker on base and went to try it out one weekend. I made a chicken and veggie thing. After cooking it for 10 hours on low, I thought the chicken was cooked, yeah no. That was with me plugging the slow cooker right into the wall. Not a good experience.Now I plug all my American appliances (George Foreman Grill, crock pot, etc) into the converter. I know everything will be cooked and will heat to temp. I can't believe I went over a year before buying one. If you live in Japan with American appliances, you NEED one of these.****UPDATE******4/13/12The silly thing up and died on me. I didn't use it often, it just stopped working one day. Since I now have to replace it, maybe I should try a different brand. Boo!"
2,Book needs better editing,"This book needs better formatting/editing. It often works through examples that are referenced in a chart/diagram on another page.I am a Junior Mechanical Engineering student, and the book tone seems a little ""dumbed down"" for an academic science class, this book works well for those in tech programs that only need to touch on electronics."
2,Not for engineers,I bought this book to place in my personal library as a reference book. I was very disappointed as this book deals with electronics at high school level and is not in depth in any of the topics .Will have to donate it to a secondary school or vocational school .
2,introduction into electronics,"The book is alright but the cd that came with it doesn't work properly! There is a error ""invalid character was found in context Line 1 , postion 37, msn electronic workbench .xml. I would like a replacement copy I tried too contact the publisher but they said I had to talk to you about it. please let me know what can be done as soon as possible I need it for my class that I am currently enrolled in . Thank you call me if you can @ 209 277 1593.."
3,introduction to electronics,"This is a good bllk but in my opinion it is most oriented to like a check book, no like for learning purpose."
5,A book of great poems of lessons for children,"This is an excellent book. It is small and pocket-sized so my children can handle it very easily. This book is advertized as being a hardcover when it actually is not. It is still worth it to get it, though."
3,A (small) classic,"I'm a huge Belloc fan and bought this as a gift for a friend who just had a child. It is a classic, something every child should own. My only caution against this edition is that it is very, very small. If you need a travel edition of Belloc, then this is for you. Otherwise I'd recommend a lager version.So, content gets 5 stars, but this particular edition is a little lacking."
5,Nice touchy book,"All three of my kids have loved these touch and feel books. The different textures will occupy my one year old for 15 minutes! What parent doesn't need that! Even better, they're using fine motor skills AND learning about the sense of touch at the same time."
2,An okay book about a gay FBI agent,".... Much of this book focuses on J. Edgar Hoover, a man many, especially homophobes, assume to be gay...What I liked about this book is how he mention his Italian-American heritage and thus blends issues of sexual orientation with ethnicity. One reviewer said he wished the book had photos, my copy of the book did. Perhaps individuals who have jobs where they can't come out will appreciate this book a lot. It was just okay; I wasn't blown away."
5,Great Service,My book was in great condition as stated and was shipped on time. I had no problem at all.
4,There's no place like home,We all wonder if there is more for our lives. But yu don's have to look any farther than your own back yard. Family is where your heart is.
1,Shopworn Story,"I like Lea Thompson, but there was no acting in this movie, just alot of sighing. It was really awful."
3,It's a wonderful life just one more time,"Yes, there are probably dozens of Christmas movies out there ripping off the ""IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"" theme, but really, does anyone watch these things to see great film making. You know how it's going to end before it even starts. You know the main character is shallow in the beginning and sees the error of his/her ways by the end and you know that the Angel or whatever will make it right in the end. Come on, these movies are just supposed to make you feel good. This wasn't the best of those theme movies but it's not the worst. I say, watch it and then when it's over just say: ""Aww, wasn't that cute."""
2,Eh.,"This movie is a rehash of every other tacky Christmas movie that you've ever seen, cranked out in time for holiday audiences to spend money on. See it on cable if you must, but save your money for the tons of wonderful, uplifting and entertaining films with decent acting.If you like this theme of holiday dreams coming true with valuable lessons learned, I'd highly recommend Holiday Switch, also available on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Holiday-Switch-Bret-Anthony/dp/B003X2P98K/ref=cm_pdp_rev_itm_title_2"
2,Cliche theme and lousy acting,"I hate to pile on, butThe Christmas Clausecertainly was a disappointment. The whole ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is just boring and cliche. It's become the theme of hundreds of other Christmas movies. Frankly, I think audiences are becoming sick of it. It's fine to preach that people should appreciate their lives, but adult life is more complex than shown in these films.The Christmas Clausetries too hard to preach the virtues of family life, but instead comes across as unoriginal. Part of the problem is that the acting is lousy. Lea Thompson sounds like she's repeating her lines rather than engaged in emotional dialogue. I just couldn't get excited about it or the story - especially when there are so many other great Christmas movies to watch, likeIt's a Wonderful Life."
5,HEAVY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HEAVY! Probably the most heavy Pentagram album in existence - hey, maybe one of the heaviest albums of all time. And it manages very well without having to resort to Cookie Monster lead vocals, he's more like a versatile Ozzy. 90% new material, I'm pretty sure only Mad Dog is from the 1970s. 1970s you say? Yeah, he's old as my dad, but jeez, can he put out some bludgeoning doom. Doom? Heavy Metal? Sludge? Call it what you want. Turn it up. Enjoy. (...)."
1,"defective book, basically unreadable","I bought this book from Amazon. The book condition is good. But the quality of the book is really bad and the book is unreadable. Most of the figures are missing lines (either horizontal or vertical). Most of the equations are also missing lines and symbols. Has the publisher really done some edit work on it or just my bad luck? I don't know. Be careful when you order this book.Since ""analog circuit design"" is a series, the book I mentioned is the 2002 version with ISBN:1-4020-7213 or 9781402072161"
1,DOES NOT WORK MORE THAN ONE TIME.,"VERY disappointing. This product worked one time, and after that, after doing as the hotspot website instructed to re-use them by microwaving in water for one minute increments, they looked like clear liquid again, but after sitting for a bit, they turned hard as a rock and are not useable anymore. I wasted my money on these. Too bad they don't work."
3,"Well-researched, Well-written","This book defininitely opened my eyes to the ""Slaughterhouse"" of the Balkans. The book was definitely well-researched and well-written, but it definitely dragged on at times. Rieff seemed to be repeating himself throughout the whole book, but his points were obviously well-taken. It also described various detailed, graphic accounts of some of the hardships that many people had to live with. It portrayed all sides of the whole Bosnia/Serbia/Croatia genocide and compared it to the Holocaust. Rieff also berates the rest of the world for not coming to the aid of the thousands of victims of this war. A good overview of the entire Balkan conflict."
2,Limp,"David Rieff's book is one of many I have read on the Balkan conflict in the 1990s and I must say I was pretty disappointed with it. The book reads like an extended news report -- dry, factual and extremely boring. There wasn't much personal interpretation of the events, or sadly, anything new to say. The worst thing about Rieff's book I can think of is that it does nothing for one who knows zero about the war. A background of the conflict was not given, and he just went straight into talking about the war itself and the crimes on all sides. Mind-boggling and unfriendly."
2,interesting story but infuriating writing style,"I have been interested in reading about the history of the Bosnian war as my father was in the US army stationed there for a time during my youth and I am now married to a refugee from that war. This book has a very interesting story but I was thrown off from becoming lost in the book due to the writer's aggravating writing. The run-on sentences and rambling made me feel like he was just writing down his thoughts of his experience and its too distracting. In addition the lack of organization of the chapters, topics, the book period makes it even more frustrating. Just not my style"
2,Disappointed,"rec'd my order today just as promised, Bought this item because STANLEY always had a great history of being built tough,rugged..BUT TO MY SURPRISE, (IT'S MADE IN CHINA) VERY disappointed, if i'd known this, I never would have purchased it... time will tell"
4,Great bottle - Lousy handle,"I've had one of these for several years. It keeps my tea hot until I'm ready to refill my mug (around 5-6 hours into my shift). Often, I don't get a chance to drink my tea during the shift, so I wait until the morning after work to drink it. The tea is still steaming after 9+ hours. The one weak point is the cheap spot-welded handle. The handle broke off at the weld about 2 months after I got it. Outside of the cheap handle construction, the bottle is virtually bulletproof, keeps your drinks hot, and is an excellent value. I gave it 4 stars. If not for the handle problem, I'd have given it 5 stars."
5,Hot or Cold All Day!,"The Stanley Food Jar works great! It keeps liquids, stews, etc. hot all day. The insulated lid also doubles as a bowl. I bring this to work frequently with my lunch or dinner. It is leak-proof so I don't have to worry about it spilling during my commute. Holds up well and still looks like new. Also, the wide mouth allows you to clean it easily. Normally, this items sells for almost $40, so finding it under $30 is a good deal!For Best ResultsPreheat or precool jar by filling it with boiling water or ice water.Let stand for five minutes.Empty jar and immediately fill with your favorite food."
1,Stanley San Easy Dribble Stopper.,"I bought a ""Stanley"" thermos and found it to be made in china not the USA. I tried it any way and they no longer have the pour through stopper and the replacements will not fit the new chinese bottles. They call the new stoppers you have to half unscrew, to pour, an Easy Pour but it should be called easy dribble. It dribbles when you pour and it leaks when it's tight and it doesn't keep coffee hot more than a couple hours.No thanks on the replacement. I got my money back on a return and purchased TWO, GOOD, real Stanely thermos on the used market for the cost of the junk new chinese one."
3,MADE IN CHINA!,"UNBELIEVABLE! MADE IN CHINA!The stopper feels very light--there's not much weight to it. The seal looks decent, though.Food says hot on the coldest days (Central Pennsylvania) at least until lunchtime. I've never tested it to a really long period of time, though."
1,Does not keep food warm,I bought two of these food jars and the first one kept the food hot for a about a month but then the food was cold after a few hours. The second one kept the food only warm to start out with and later on did not keep the temperature at all. I rinse the thermos with boiling water first and the food is boiling when I pour it into the thermos but it did not keep the temperature.
2,"Doesn't maintain temp, handle falls off","I own two, and have had problems with both. Even when pre-heated, coffee/ tea is luke warm 3 hours later. Sturdy product--should be for it is pretty heavy5/4/07 update-- I think it is important to mention that shortly after the original review was posted, Stanley contacted me to offer a replacement. I thought this was pretty cool. I would add another star if Amazon would let me"
1,handle dfo`d,i had this thermos for a couple weeks then noticed the spot welds on the handle support were broken. no longer carry it.is a dissapointment when you hear about stanley`s quality
3,They don't make 'em like they used to =(,"We not only have bought a few Stanley Thermos' over the years, we have also recommended them to family and friends. They are durable and keep things hot. I recently decided to buy another one because the lid was broke on the old one and we can always use another one. When the new one came, I immediately could tell the difference.(and my 13 year old son too). This new one is very light and the inside looks like it could shatter very easily. We have dropped the old ones quite a few times and only the lid was damaged.It keeps food hot enough, it just feels really thin, light, and cheap. If Stanley wants to go with cheaper materials, they could at least drop the price. =("
3,Not as heavy as the older ones,"I purchased this to replace an identical one that I had which would no longer keep liquids hot. At the time, I didn't realize that my original was under warranty (lifetime) and I've subsequently arranged a replacement for it.Regarding THIS item... Although it's identical in appearance to my original, I did notice that it is much lighter and cheaper-feeling than my original which was purchased new only 4 years ago. If a solid-feeling product is any indication of quality and performance, I would likely have been disappointed with this vacuum bottle IF I had not returned it."
3,Effective Time for Keeping Food Hot,Stanley claims that this food jar will keep the contents hot for 15 hours. My experience is that it keeps food hot about 1/2 that time; about 7 or 8 hours for chili.
1,Made in CHINA,"From the Amazon Description:The distinctive Stanley bottle is an American Icon that still works as hard today as it did nearly 100 years ago. Stanley... Built for Life.This AMERICAN Icon is manufacted in CHINA.I purchased mine based on a review that this was made in the USA posted in December. Mine arrived today and MADE in CHINA is stamped in the metal.It would be so helpful if AMAZON would include the Country of Manufacture in the Features of the product rather than allow the abovewhich certainly implied (along with another reviewer's positive statement) that the product was made in the USA.I will gladly pay more for products that are manufactured in a country that believes in Human Rights and is not a tremendous polluter of our Earth.Please Amazon, give us a bit more information."
1,Does not keep food warm.,"After a few months of use, it quit keeping food or liquid warm. Not the same quality as the ones made years ago."
3,sturdy but limited insulation ability,"A Thermos, or more properly called a ""Dewar flask"" or vacuum insulated container (Thermos is a brand), uses a vacuum as an insulator as a vacuum conducts no heat. All heat loses are via the material where the inner container is connected to the outer container. A good test of a Dewar flask would be if it can keep water boiling hot overnight while stored in your freezer, and glass-lined flasks can do this, but they are fragile and would not withstand dropping. This container's metal construction makes this container extremely resilient to drops and other abuse, however metal is a conductor of heat and consequently this container does not keep the contents cold/hot for any significant amount of time. If you put in boiling hot soup before you go to work, it will be pleasantly warm at lunch time. Based upon your requirements, this container may or may not fulfill your needs."
5,Does the job.,Soup to an isolated place in the country. My soup was hot and tasty. Thank you Stanley. I would get this for anyone.
3,good for those not in the know,"This work speaks about the first emperor, a slave who would have been forced to make his mausoleum, the mausoleum, the walls built around China, the terracotta soldiers, etc. Basically, this may feel like ""too many cooks"" for some. This work won't help you pass a test in Chinses history. But if you wanted some quick knowledge about a longstanding civilization, then this was a good starting point.This work showed an assassin failing to kill the emperor who was a few feet away. It showed how many writing styles were unified into one legal style. In short, this brings up a lot that was mentioned in Jet Li's ""Hero,"" so viewers might want to see this documentary if they loved that film.This work says the emperor feared death. He built a huge afterworld. It took thousands of people to create it. It included many of the creature comforts of the contemporary living world. In short, it sure sounded like the pharaohs in Ancient Egypt, but that group is not mentioned here."
2,A Little Disappointing,"Ever since she published Prince Charming, Garwood hasn't been up to snuff. I am a big fan of her other books, The Gift, The Bride, and The Prize to name but a few. Lately, though, it seems and if she is selling out and not putting as much effort into the characters and stories. I felt like I was back in middle school reading a harlequin romance (yuk!) I hope that she will write better in the future."
2,disappointing,I usually really like Garwood but this book which is three stories in one book is very disapointing. The first and the last brothers' stories seemed forced.
5,A great book,"This has to be the best of the Clayborne series. I loved it. It was the first book I read by Julie Garwood and while I liked one red rose and one white rose, one pink rose was the best. I love Travis and Emily's story."
1,disappointment,"I love most of ms Garwood's BOOKS THIS WAS A REAL LET DOWN NOT HER USUAL STUFF VERY RUSHED QUITE JUVENILE NO EXPANDING NO SENSUALITY ,MORE OF A SHORT STORY VERSION OF A CHEAP WESTERN WHAT A SHAME!!!!"
1,Utterly Disappointed!,"Julie Garwood is my favorite author. Every time I see a new book, I get very excited and want to purchase it immediately. I was extremely disappointed when I read this series. I enjoyed the series of Rebellious Desire, The Bride, etc. and was hoping that this series would be just as good but its not!"
1,Ms. Garwood what were you thinking?,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books. My favorites are The Gift, The Secret, and The Prize. I was expecting wonders when I heard The Clayborne Brides is going to be a mini series on TV so I bought the book. Oh My God I was disappointed, all three stories were just terrible. I hope Ms. Garwood will write better than this in the future."
4,good,"i've read many books of Ms. Garwood's. i LOVED for the roses and thought i'd like the Clayborne Brides. I DID like them, they were good however i thought they were a bit rushed. :)"
5,"A Great Following For ""For The Roses""","As soon as I read For The Roses, I wanted to read these novellas. They were masterpeices in their own ways, and I loved them all. Travis and Emily's story was simple but sweet. It seemed Ms. Garwood was just getting her juices flowing with this one. In Douglass and Isabell's story, she seems to pick up speed. The characters become more developed and they plot more intense. Adam and Geneveive's story top it off. They are what save the novellas from becoming washed up. The characters are, again, more developed and three dimensional. The story is also more intruiging. But, they are all extremely well written, and I think much more praise then they have gotten. As usual, the romances are unique and touching. Ms. Garwood makes a genuine attempt to help you get to know the brothers better. In short, if you've read For The Roses, these novellas are for you."
5,One of the best series out there!,"Julie Garwood is new to me but I was not disappointed! Her chaqracters are witty, charming, and very funny! Keep it up Julie!"
2,"Read Her Other Books, They're Better","Overall I love Julie Garwood's historical romances - I haven't read her contemporary ones yet... However this historical one just doesn't cut it. The collection of short stories, has thin character development and weak plots. The stories are simply too simplistic and you never develop a connection to the characters."
3,"Too little, too fast","Three of the Clayborne brothers' unusual courtships are described in this book. The storylines include a woman being escorted to meet her mail-order husband, a pregnant widow in need of protection, and a gospel singer on the run after a thief tries to steal the church money.I can't believe these books were once published on their own. All of the plots were rushed and thinly developed. The characters were barely distinguishable from each other. There was scarcely any romantic interaction between couples, much less passion. The only decent book of the three was One White Rose, which told of the woman who is in labor when her Clayborne man arrives. At least that one is funny. Garwood's signature humor is not present in the other two books, and I didn't feel I had read anything substantial after I completed this trilogy."
4,Not a huge fan,"Personally, I like Garwood's Highland novels the best. This American trilogy seemed weak and lacking in basic emotion. On red rose was the best out of the three, it's the only one where the hero has even a chance to love anything about the heroine but her appearance. Unrealistic though...do you expect me to believe that an African American was treated equally in the Wild West? Nice Utopia dream world Garwood has going there, something I'd be proud to have in the history books, but it's just not believable! The Clayborne guys are sweet though, and worth reading about if you have the time."
4,A Sniper's Handbook.,"I agree with the sniper instructor. This book is excellent. It has many pictures and diagrams to show and explain the topics discussed in this book. Some topics include weapons, concealment, training, and scopes. The book gets down to the point with no BS and is easy to understand. Mark V. Lonsdale in my opinion is a great aurthor and his other books are just as good as this one. I would highly recommend this book to snipers and anyone interested in the art of sniper/counter sniper."
1,Shallow - why buy this book at all?,"There are quite a few other books on sniping that you need to buy before this one. I do not know about the background of the other reviewers but to call this a good book on sniping is BS. A very, very light introduction, maybe, but the book does not cover ANYTHING in detail. It is at best useful for a wanna-be sniper and maybe not even so: If you include so little details, but still manage to explain where to shoot a man in the head it is at best missguiding.I am sure that mr. Lonesdale knows his stuff, but this book is lightweight."
4,Worth reading,"Personally I am more interested in military sniping, but still Sniper/Counter Sniper gave a lot of good tips on the subject of long range shooting and especially in how to train yourself in the art of becoming a competent sniper."
5,The best!,"I used Gorilla Glue to try and glue a tail onto a stone animal figurine, and it did not work. Then I used Elmer's Super Glue, and it worked great! I would definitely recommend it!"
5,Fast and safe,"I spent a lot of time looking at all the electric kettles and reading reviews. I picked this one and I'm glad I did. I love having water indicator levels on both sides. It's also easy to fill. The spout is large enough to hold it under the faucet, although the water can't be turned on full force because the filter is there (most or all have a filter) or the lid can be tipped up to hold under the faucet. The base remains cool as does the bottom of the kettle so it can be placed on a table. The outside gets very warm but not hot enough to burn if you touch it. There is a small circular metal part on the bottom which is recessed and fits into a circular part in the base, which is the path to heat the water. I love having an electric kettle because it turns off when the water is hot. I didn't like my tea kettle because the whistle was loud and shrill and I had to stay nearby to get it immediately. It pours well. I got the black one and think it looks attactive on the counter."
2,doesn't last,"We bought this kettle in Jan. 08 and it is now December. We use it to heat water for tea 4-6 times/day. The kettle was great, but seems to have shorted out. It worked sporadically for about 3 days and now no longer works at all."
4,"So Far, So Good!","I've only had the kettle a few weeks, but so far it works great. I am cautiously optimistic as SO MANY things these days seem to have built-in obsolescence and only last a year or less.... The Braun WK200B is VERY handsome!"
1,it leaks,"I bought this as a replacement for an electric kettle that I had for about 7 years which had one day stopped working.And now after 6 months this one has sprung a leak, do I bother to look for the warranty? Doubt it.I'll just go down to my local big box retailer and get a cheap replacement and hope it lasts longer then 6 months."
2,7 cups is too little,7cups is too little...I don't realize how many is 7cups but when I got to boil with it the first time....7 cups seems so little water you can get for one boil.
1,Beware of Braun's Despicable Customer Service,"My problem was identical to the other complaint. My kettle's light would toggle on/off and would not operate after a few months of use. I was told by Braun to send in my defective kettle at my own cost. After 2 MONTHS of calling Braun and listening to their lame excuses, I have not received a replacement. I am simply disgusted by my experience with Braun and want others to know about Braun's despicable customer service. If anyone else has a similar Braun experience, I urge you to write about it to warn others NOT to buy Braun products."
5,"Great in college, great now...","I love this water kettle because it works so well and has the automatic shut-off feature, so you do not need to worry about forgetting to switch it off.It's fast, has a filter for coarser residue, and heats water quickly. It pours nicely and, unless you go entirely overboard due to a lack of patience, never drips. I had this thing in college for teas, soups, and cooking... and it worked then as well as it does now for broth, teas dog food, and pasta... not that you put the pasta into the kettle but it speeds up the cooking of the water. ;)I can recommend this item, although it has gotten fairly costly... the price is double what I paid for on amazon.com for a J&R; version. It looks stylish but is all plastic, which surprised me, since the image hinted at some chrome parts. This does not take from the overall appeal this utensil sports."
5,Best ever water kettle!,"This kettle (no longer available in the US) is far better than the many other kettles I tested. The exterior stays cool, it has been reliable for years, and the ergonomics of refilling (without needing to ever lift the lid) as well as lifting the kettle with one hand and pouring are excellent. I wish Braun would bring this 120Volt model back into production so I could give it as gifts!"
5,Great product!,"We've had this for almost 3 years and it is still working great. We use it daily. Usually 2 to 3 times per day. We got it mainly to replace theHot Shotthat we had, but never lasted long and had to be replaced often. We immediately noticed that the Braun heated the water to boiling, where as the Hot Shot got hot, but never reaching boiling. Also, the larger capacity made this a much more practical product, so it wasn't just for making tea anymore, I started using it a lot when cooking."
3,ok for year-and-a-half,"This water kettle did AMAZING the first year-and-a-half. Then, mysteriously started to leak water...but not all the time, just occasionally. We could never figure it out. We gave it to my sister and as far as I know, just followed our guideline to not fill it past a certain point and uses it still.Electric water kettles rock."
2,Ok but not for daily use,I've had 2 of these kettles in the past year and both have died. We probably use it 10 times a day. I bought it based on the great reviews but it's not that great when you go through 2 per year.It cost me $40 so I'm surprized that it is so expensive now. This is definitely not worth $150
5,This machine works great!,"A friend recommended this Braun water kettle and it's wonderful! It heats up water in 70 seconds- saves energy and time. I use it for making tea, boullion, and hot water for my dish water. I highly recommend this item!"
5,Unbeatable German Efficiency,"My wife and I are frequent tea drinkers, so we like having hot water on-hand all the time. We initially bought an Asian electric boiler with auto-reboil, but it ended up costing us an arm and a leg in electricity bills due to its poor insulation and constant re-boiling.Recently we found the Braun AquaExpress and haven't looked back since. It's extremely fast and eliminates the need to boil water ahead of time. It also looks great on our kitchen counter, and the construction seems very sturdy and reliable. Highly recommended!"
5,Can't have a morning without it!,"I first learned about an electric kettle when living in Germany. Everyone there uses it for tea. We use it for tea, instant coffee, instant grits, instant oatmeal and for making tea by the gallon. My husband and I use it for coffee every morning. He is doing PT at 3:30am and I get up at 5:30. Coffee sitting in a pot would be cold and old with the time difference. We just make a single cup when we want one. The kettle heats the water faster than the microwave."
4,Braun Kettle,This Kettle is fast when it comes to heating water. One problem is that it draws a lot of electricity in the process.We can not have our 2 coffee makers on while it is heating the water or it will trip a fuse.Other then that I love it.
2,Nice product but died too early.,I have enjoyed using this kettle for a 14 month period.Last week it started leaking water all of a sudden. At first we did not understand what it was happening. It was leaking from bottom of the kettle. I had to discard it otherwise we could have electrocuted.
1,Leakage,The kettle itself is pretty and worked well in the beginning. Unfortunately it started leaking pretty badly after just about five months of use. Couldn't determine what the problem was.
4,Fast and Quite but no notification.,"The Kettle works very well. I replaced a Phillips one I had for years which broke. I guess the only thing I would like to see on this one is some notification that the water is done. The Phillips would auto shot off and when it did, it would ring this little bell inside. The new kettle just turns of, it's quiet and you forget about it, then you have to reheat... a little 'ding' would help."
2,A champ. Maybe not so much.,"Purchased this kettle three weeks ago and so far it works superbly, boiling water in no time. So much faster than the stovetop! UPDATE: Sadly, I discovered this kettle sitting in a pool of water one morning when I came downstairs. It had seeped from the bottom of the kettle during the night. It was a great kettle while it lasted, but I replaced it with a Breville and have been quite happy with my new kettle, purchased three years ago now."
2,A Misleading Title and a Disappointing Work,"For those interested in a comprehensive introduction to the history of Christianity, 1001 Surprising Things You Should Know About Christianity will prove terribly disappointing. As mentioned in another review, many of the 1001 items listed are certainly not surprising to most students of Christian history, and there are numerous inaccuracies and errors in the book. In addition, the book is organized somewhat haphazardly, which only lessens its usefulness ..."
3,Quirky-charactered strange stories,"Jigs and Reels starts out strong, with five, five-star reads out of the first ten stories: a high school reunion...of witches, endearing elderly escapees, Cinderella's sister side of the story, a fearsome free spirit and a wrongly accused man. But the rest rang from science fiction to weird to somewhere in between: number mania, an obsessed gamer, disabled swimmers, ""Every Tuesday's Freak Day at the Body in Question;"" and a writer encounters the castoffs characters of his never finished stories. Those who like the unusual, will probably love this collection. Best feature: the author provides a brief intro to each story telling how, when, where, or why the idea for it came about. Mainstream readers may prefer: New Sudden Fiction edited by Robert Shapard and James Thomas or Runaway by Alice Munro. Strange short story fans might also like: Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami."
4,Jigs and Reels,"The first story in the book was excellent, a touching, funny look at old age. I wanted it to go on into a full length novel. Some of the other stories were dark. I enjoyed the ones with a science fiction flavor less than the others, but was amazed at the range of styles Ms. Harris covered. The whole book was extremely well written, drawing the reader on to the next tale. I am looking forward to future books by Joanne Harris."
4,pretty good,"i got this yesterday, and the only real problem i found was the fact that it had no built in light for night shootingi got a mini led mag light thoughworks just as well"
5,This little camera fit the bill,"I was looking for a little starter camera and this one is really working out for me. I let my kids use it (ages 10 - 15) and it is holding up great. It takes excellent, clear pictures and nice little film clips at a reasonable price. I am not shooting for an Oscar yet, so until that time comes this little camera is just great. I have had no problems, and I mean NO problems. I would recommend the product, especially for the money."
4,theres a better book read below,"i want to say that while this book is a very good book and certainly you will get your moneys worth and good value and it does provide lots of information..there is a much better book..the book i recommend is""Boiler Operator's Workbook"" by R. Dean Wilson, Fourth Edition..that book can be found here on Amazon.. it contains more detailed information and is very well written and is easily understood by every level of mechanic..i own both books.. and i recommend the Boiler Operators Workbook.. it's better a few dollars cheaper and lots more for your money.. i got the book from a boiler training seminar and so since i didn't buy it here i cant review it on that page.. so i wanted to be sure i said something in here..make sure you get the exact book i listed.. it's ISBN 978-0-8269-4497-9..it is sold here in Amazon.. where i buy pretty much everything.."
1,Better text books for a High Pressure Boiler`s license,"This book is actually worse than the authors' Low Pressure Boilers text. I recommend buying the Boiler Operator's Workbook by Wilson to actually give you more accurate information about high pressure boilers.I could go on about the misleading information in Steingress, Frost, and Walker's High Pressure Boilers text, but you can do your own research.It seems as though the authors mentioned above need to do their homework and correct their mistakes before they publish another text. For example, no one has ever heard of a supper-jet safety valve. So anyone reading this should know that this safety valve never existed."
1,Not Of Technical Value for Serious Engineers-,"This book was a great disappointment in that it had virtuallyno formulas, stress analysis for the serious mechanical engineer.The multitude of questions and answeres may help someone understand the parameters of boiler operation, it will not be of help to the designer of boilers. In the latter case a book of ASME codes, stress analysis, theory of heat transfer would be of much greater value. High Pressure Boilers provides little if none of this. On the other hand the book ""ASME Code Simplified""shipped with this book is of considerable value."
2,Less then satified,High Pressure BoilersThe product was a very old version of the book - The picture was not the same as the product. I kept the book to avoid the return process. NOT 100% satified.
3,Review of Bennet Books,"I ordered a used edition of this book which was in exellent condition, but I realized that it wasn't the book I could use. So, I sent it back to Bennet Books. I give Bennet high grades for quickly reacting to my request and return of the book. Of course, I got a restocking fee, but it went well. Thanks"
3,not quite factory,"if it wasnt for the $30 amazon card discount i wouldnt keep these mats for the price. they are thin, not shaped as shown in picture nor exactly factory fit. they should show a photo of the custom fit mats you are ordering. but color match to original grey interior is very good. be careful tho as they offer many greys."
5,Soilwork will break your face!,"this is an awesome metal cd. one of the best ever, maybe. it's heavy and fast and the vocals are cool. the vocalist's name is SPEED, which is cool. and by cool, I mean totally sweet. the best song is 'grand failure anthem' which is So fast and heavy with a good chorus. some peple said SPEED's vocals on the album arnt' as good as on Chainheart machine. i LIke chainheart machine you think not good on A Predator portrait??? both are very good musical cds. but sorry my english is not effective. i hope you like my review."
4,Expirementation brings a less focussed album,"This album doesn't come across with quite the intensity of ""the Chainheart Machine."" The vocals go from the black metal growl of the previous album to an almost ""Paradise Lost"" feel. They had a very melodic yet brutal approach with the duelling guitars on the last album. While it's still a big part of the sound, they don't seem to be relying on it as much. Perhaps they're trying to expand their sound instead of repeating the last album but it's not quite as cohesive."
4,"Very good, but lacking in qualities","Soilwork is a very talented band, but they just have not reached their peak yet. Plus, when you base a song around the ""Mega Man"" theme (""Needlefeast""), it seems off."
5,Always wanted this one.,"A friend had given me a few songs off this album, but I wanted the whole thing on hardcopy. So glad I got it, it's great! Came in good condition."
4,Surprising story that parallels todays news,I bought this book to kill time during a vacation and was pleasantly surprised with the storyline and action. The theme and sub-themes are particularly relevant today and offered more surprises than my latest Clancy read.
4,Very Good Military Thriller!,"This book deals with topics I've always been extremely interested in: the inner workings of the military, and the way in which it relates to undisputed civilian authority. If you liked ""Seven Days in May"", you'll certainly like this novel. The characters are very well defined, and the issue of the way in which our military is suffering from reduced budgets and narrow-minded policies for its use is very discreetly addressed, but firmly at the same time. There is an unmistakable sense of currency to this book; the events it narrates could very well be happening right now! As a prospective military person, I have to congratulate Captain Galdorisi on a job well done; Thank You, Sir!! If there is only want thing I could say I found lacking was the ending; I would've loved to learn more about the process against Generals Campbell and Walters. Maybe in the next book, right, Captain? :-)"
4,Preschoolers love this silly story,"I don't know why there are so many stories about farm animals, and apparently a whole subgenre devoted to farm animals who make the wrong sounds for whatever reason, but this one really is funny. I teach preschoolers and they think it's hilarious when the rooster makes all the wrong animal sounds, and they love to make the noises too. They also love the funny illustrations."
1,Stupid!,We borrowed this from the library for my 2 yr old because of all the positive reviews. We were extremely disappointed. This book has no depth or educational value. A rooster making different animal noises did not provide lasting entertainment in our house.
3,not perfect???,"hi i bought this item to put it in my car and put the ipod in it but it turns out that it's a little big and the worst thing in it that you cant control the ipod from the front screen so you need to turn it around and choose from the ipod and by the way it can only play video in the screen i'm not saying this to make you change your mind i'm just saying ""it's not perfect""..but there is some good stuff in itit can play DVD and MP3 cd's and there is 2 holes for the headphones and you can connect it to the TV(...)"
3,battery,"Pruduct is good except for the battery, it dies (for ever .... dead) after couple of months of use. Since it has a 110 VAC and a 12 VDC connector, to me it has not been a major problem."
5,He's the next James Horner,"This album is so captivating!!! He can truly paint a picture with his music!! If there was a sequel to Titanic, (I don't think there will be) I'm sure, he'd be the next composer for the soundtrack..."
5,Sexy and smart,What a fun book! You get a heaping helping of history--Pedersen has really done her research--as well as gorgeous art. This would make a great gift for the fashionista in your life
5,"Bra: A Thousand Years Of Style, Support & Seduction","Very helpful, and has alot of wonderful information."
5,A Magnificent Work!,I applaud the author for this work. It is evocative and exciting. Robbins is writing some of the best WW II fiction in the business. He is a master.
5,Last Citadel,"This book is well charactered in its historical fiction. The depth of characters makes the reader desire to see the plot unfold. A super WWII novel which I have read before, but descovered I didn't have in my library. A worthy read for any student of WWII, or any person who enjoys adventure."
5,A Military Classic,"The Last Citadel is fast-paced military fiction with its soul in the stars. The author gets the details right, but does not obsess over the grade of lead in the bullets, or the chemical composition of the propellants. Instead, he takes the swirling Battle of Kursk, millions of men and thousands of machines, and pulls it into focus as the ancient tale of a single man facing an immortal monster.Leathery old Dimitri is armored with little more than his Kazak honor, and his T-34 seems like cardboard against Hitler's latest superweapon, the massive Tiger tank. This is classic stuff disguised as hot-running fiction. Author David L. Robbins is not out to take Tom Clancy's lunch, he's trying to catch Hemingway and Steinbeck. The Battle of Hill 260.8 will make you stand up and cheer, and the Award of the Order of Buttons is a most perfect recognition of battle honors. These two scenes combine into one of the most powerful passages ever written, in any language."
3,korg tuner,"The tuner works well, but has a poorly constructed back battery cover. The first one I received broke when I tried to put it back on after inserting the battery. I was more careful with the replacement, but I can tell it might break easily as well. Music Bay's customer service was very responsive, and responded quickly to my email asking about returning the broken tuner and getting a replacement, and they mailed me a replacement in a timely manner. I would recommend Music Bay as a vendor."
3,Not a big fan...,"It's very convenient... when it works...I own a half a dozen guitars, both acoustic and electric, and have a terrible time getting the thing to sense the note being played on about half of them. I've tried a new battery, and changing the location, to no avail...As has been mentioned, it's got dark grey LCD text on an unlit orange background, and it's very difficult to read unless you are in an extremely well lit area."
4,clip on tuner,"great tuner that actually picks up the instrument without having to beat the strings off it. the reason is that this tuner picks up via of the clipon itself so it is picking up the vibrations without going all the way through the tuner. downside is that it doesn't have a light for dark stages, maybe they will change this later on, i hope so!!!"
3,Good for general use,"I'm a bassist and this device doesn't pick up the vibrations as accurately as I had hoped, but it does the job when you want to check pitch quickly on stage before a concert. I prefer to use my older Korg tuner for practicing and really fine tuning since this device can be fussy with the low tones. Backlighting would be ideal."
1,Tuner Review,"It works just as advertised. It is easy to use and read, and even for a borderline technophobe like me, not the least bit intimidating."
3,"Cheapie cable, but it works. Can't beat the $.","It works. This isn't really high-end cable (go figure by the price), but you don't need to buy Monster cable to run a security camera. Just don't yank on the cable when fishing it into an attic space or the wall. You'll tear a cable."
3,disappointing,I bought this because it was the uncut version. There is a lot of nudity in this movie. There is one explicit scene where a nun carves a stick into a dildo then masturbates with it. Another scene that should have been explicit was too dark to see the penetration or the actual pounding of her private parts. It is too dark to make out clear detail in the nude scenes except for the short masturbation scene. Do not buy this movie for a plot because it has a very weak one that has an unrealistic ending but that is not why you would buy this one anyway.
2,Marginal At Best,"Maybe I just don't understand. Good movie, but not one that I will watch twice. History was good. Again, good for the history lesson but not a re-watcher."
5,"Great documentary, OK movie","The movie is a valiant effort but everything is so negative its hard to have any compassion for anybody. There is an incredible documentary ""Lives In Hazard"" in the bonus section that tells the story of the making of the movie. They interview real-life gang members and convicts in Folsom. The technical advisor for this movie (a former gang member) was murdered in her own driveway after the movie was made."
1,american me dvd,Cd just read disc error...dvd did not work in any of my video systems. DISAPPOINTED :( Hard to find this dvd!!!!
2,Haven't Recieved It Yet !,I Haven't recieved it yet and honestly forgot that I even ordered it ! When I recieve my DVD I'll be more than happy to review it !Gregg A. Schafer
3,American Me...and glorifying the Mexican Mafia,"This is the second time I have purchased this film. My first copy was found to be missing during a move.""American Me"" is filled with inaccurate information about the Mexican Mafia, and according to ""Boxer"", a dropped out member of this organized crime prison institution, three people were ""wacked"" by EME because of insulting and embellished story telling on the part of Edward James Olmos.I highly recommend any student of law enforcement, in particular, Corrections Officer candidates, to purchase this film as well as read the book ""The Black Hand"", a prose written about the impact of the Mexican Mafia in this generation.It's unfortunate tha these three deaths occured due to ""story"" telling, but most likely these individuals would have died by the sword anyway due to the fact they were still active gang members.I most likely will have this film around for a short period of time, as I see it as a good yardsale filler."
4,American Me,"Although it is somewhat outdated now, it still is a powerful portrayal of gangs and the EME. Worth watching for sure."
1,waste of time,"This was a horrible movie and complete waste of time. The acting was terrible, it was like they were reading a script. I don't get what the other review was talking about when they said they had nightmares for weeks, there was nothing that graphic in here. I had to force myself to finish watching it, hoping it would get better, but it didn't."
1,DON;T WASTE YOUR TIME,"This film is a weak attempt at portraying ""prison life"". It may have had its place and time but overall the film is lacking. Check out ""Blood In-Blood Out"" and ""Weeds"". Bad Boys with Sean Penn is another good ""prison movie""."
5,Great album,"If you haven't heard of Halfbreed before, you definetly need to do yourself a favor and check them out. Unfortunately the group is no longer together anymore, R.O.C. is kicking it with Twiztid again and Skrapz has a solo career, but this cd will always be remembered as one of the best the underground has to offer. R.O.C.'s beats are simply outstanding and both members, but Skrapz in particular, rips great flows. I have this cd and I can honestly say you will be able to listen to the entire thing the whole way through without having to skip a track, which is rare to find. While all the songs are great, my personal favorites are ""Don't Get Caught Up"" and ""Plead."" Spread the virus!"
3,Some good principles if you're new to the bible,"If you're not new to the bible and already understand the basics of Christian living, this book may not do much for you. There are a number of good pearls that made it worth the purchase but overall, I didn't get much in the way of concrete recommendations on how to manage behavioral problems. It's more of a general overview of how to be a Christian parent."
4,Good book,I like the Biblical standpoint and simple message of this little book. My husband and I are reading it together as a devotion.
1,"Wanted the DVD, not a download","Thought I was ordering the DVD, instead it downloaded to my computer ... no use for computer version. Will have to reorder."
5,the best fiddler,This movie is the best of the fiddler on the roof movies - with Topol starring in it - who has performed on stage with this production over many years and in many countries. I saw this film on T.V. and have seen the stage production. It is timeless and any generation should love it. You can also just put it on and listen to the songs whilst doing your housework. But I can watch this film over and over again. And amazingly it is now on blu ray. If u are a fan of the musical then this is a must have for your collection.
4,Fiddler on the Roof,Great as always. the digital version had only one issue where it paused for a second and then skipped ahead by a frame or so. This was not due to streaming because I downloaded the movie before watching it.
5,Great movie!,This movie is a classic. The music and story are very engaging. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals.
5,A classic,"One of many enjoyable musicals. For those of us without access to live theater, this is great. Memorable music, sweet or poignant characterizations."
3,"Great movie,great visuals but audio syncing problems are disturbing",I am trying to watch all the classics my Mother tried to get me watch when i was a youngster...this was one of them..although not a big fan of musicals this movie was great..the visuals for a film made quite a while ago were fantastic like it was made a few years ago...so bravothe problem is that despite the great restoration work the studio did for this release as far as the video portion of it they insulted the hard work of those who worked on it by doing a HORRIBLE job on the Audio!1..first part of the movie I didnt even notice but by the later part of the middle of the movie words are completely spoken before hearing the beginning of the word..its so out of sync that its almost unwatchable ..how can you restore a classic and drop the ball on the audio?
1,Don't buy this Blu-ray,"Just recently bought 2 blu-ray movies, ten commandment and Fiddler on the roof- the contrast is like day and night, with ten commandment being absolutely amazing and jaw-dropping and fiddler on the roof being an absolute disappointment. This movie has the exact Sound and picture quality of its DVD version -really folks , there is nothing BLUE about it and is a very cheap remastering(if anything????)Don't waste your $ on it, or you'll be truely frustrated."
1,lips and sound not in synch.. unwatchable.,dont buy it. I want my money back. whoever remastered this Blu-Ray should be fired. The audio is very much out of synch with the video. Are they kidding? Travesty! Also the video is NO better than the old dvd is. Huh?
5,Excellent,I have realy enjoyed the movie and will repeatedly watch it. Thank you.I invited a wheelchair bound neighbor to share the viewing and had pizza while watching.
5,"""Fiddler on the Roof"" is an essential for any home library!","""Fiddler on the Roof"" is an essential for any home library! Pardon me, but this is truly a no-brainer. Aside from being a valuable historical record for Jewish families, this Classic will provide a mesmerizing look into a lifestyle in the ""Pale"" of Pre-Soviet Russia. It is at once comic and tragic throughout, and it continues to move all who see it. Not to be missed!"
1,I dont remember this order,"I don't remember this order, I think it was cancelled but I am really not sure to be honest with you."
4,Fiddler on the Roof,music was excellent and costuming as well however I thought the plot could have been developed more in the area of sibling interface
2,Fiddler on the Roof DVD (used),Great price on the movie and have been completely satisfied with the quality and condition of this used DVD. I will continue to use Amazon.
2,"okay, but not the version I ordered.","I ordered the special edition. I got a regular edition. Unfortunately, I already had it out of the package before I realized it."
4,Fiddler On The Roof,"Fiddler On The Roof is one of the best musicals ever made. On my top ten of all time. Great story and locations,"
4,"good movie, but could have been shorter","i like musicals and i like lengthy movies but i just don't like the two of them combined. i love grease because it is only 1 hour 52 minutes. Fiddler on the Roof is a good movie but heck it's 3 hours! I watched this movie in drama class because we are doing the play in spring so my teacher wanted us to see what we were doing. don't get me wrong, i like this movie, it has a great story, great characters, everything, they just could have cut 1 hour out of it and made it about 2, 2 1/2 hours the most. But still I need to get the DVD and watch it like that because we watched it on video and the image wasn't that great. but check this movie out, if you can sit down long enough"
3,In the same tradition of other movies,"I'm asking myself why there are so many movies about good jewish people and their traditions. I can recall now Schindlers list, the pianist, Munich, Life is Beautiful, Holocaust, Diary of Anne Frank, and a lot moe. Another movies are about heroic jewish people of other that have suffered the holocaust or terrible atrocities. I think this too much propaganda. We, the rest of the world, need musical, drama, war, and etc movies in the same nubers as ""jewish about"" movies where the heroes and the suffering ones are from the rest of the world. The fiddler in the roof is not an exception."
5,Review of Fiddler on the Roof,"This is a wonderful motion picture. The music is supurb!! Topol was a wonderful pick for the part of Topol. His voice is wonderful. The story is great, too. I recommend it for every family. I don't mind watching it again and again with different members of my family, especially my grandchildren. (11)."
5,Fiddler on the Roof,It is a great movie and it is historical...these things really happened...my family had a similar experience during the war there. .
5,Excellent Movie!,Great story with wonderful songs! This version of the film is the better of the two available. Topov makes this story come alive!
4,Great Quality DVD,This DVD came with a different cover than the one in the picture. The one I received is the 40th anniversary cover which is great. DVD in perfect condition. Would purchase from this company again.
4,A wonderful Movie!,"I have always loved this movie. I loved it when it was on VHS, but now on DVD it is Awesome.Only one problem, which I need to run the DVD on my computer DVD player . THE movie during the wedding scene froze thengot stuck. I hope the DVD is not the problem but my DVD player. Other than that, the picture is clear as a bellthe audio is awesome!"
3,The story of course is as good as ever,This restoration is not as good as other classic films I recently purchased. The Sound of Music for instance.This restoration was the same one I saw when I bought it on Laserdisc back in the 90's. It was not restored for the 1080P format and it shows. The quality is low and the images are grainy compared to Sound of Music. I hope they do a proper restoration again in the 1080p format from a 70MM print.
4,Fine musical,Topal shines as Tevya the father of 5 daughters...3 of whom are of marriageable age..they also have minds of their own when it comes to the groom
5,Awesome Movie,"I love Fiddler on the Roof. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and I have seen the play two or three times with different actors playing the part of Tevya. Topol is still by far the best in my opinion. It's a wonderful story filled with joy, laughter, pain, struggle, and acceptence."
4,"Great movie, music, picture and sound!","Fiddler on the Roof looks terrific on blu-ray! Is anyone else having trouble viewing all the special features? Most of them won't play. My player goes to ""stop"" after I select them. I've never had this happen before."
1,GREAT MUSICAL,"TODAYS MUSICALS, SOMEHOW, AREN'T EQUAL TO THOSE OF YEARS GONE BY. A GOOD STORY TO GO WITH THE MUSIC."
5,The best of all musicals.,"I agree with HeadbangerDuh in every sense. This is the best of musicals. While some other musicals amy be corny, boring, and downright dumb, Fiddler shows humor, interest, and is educational. Although part one is funnier, part two I feel is richer, and more full, not as goofy. This is probably the best film of the century."
2,Skinny Letterbox,"""Fiddler"" is a great movie, but the presentation on this DVD is a letterbox so narrow it makes viewing uncomfortable even on my 32"" SONY. This is the kind of widescreen you're better off not buying unless you have 16:9 screen ratio. I won't be buying one for a couple of years so this purchase was a waste. I love this move, however. Happily, I have it in full-screen VHS. Had they only used a wider letterbox, I could have stood it, but the screen is mostly black. Be forewarned."
5,My Wife's Favorite,"My wife is extremely pleased with this gift. It's her favorite musical, and you can't beat that as a gift."
5,Fiddler a hit on X-Mas!,"Great to be able to watch this classic any time we want to at home. And who could ask for a better treat than to watch it on X-Mas! Unless, of course, you add Chinese Food take-out!"
5,Something for everyone,"Fiddler is a show that is great for everyone in the family in part because it is about everyone in the family - the father, the mother, the sons, and the daughters, all of whom have their rights and responsibilities in the family. Humor, drama, great songs, and a wonderful story about life and social evolution. The importance of traditions in an every changing society are emphasized. It also is a film you can just watch and enjoy."
3,No tiene adecuada traducción al español,"Este clásico del cine, a pesar de la calidad de esta versión, adolece de un grave defecto: no tiene traducción en español de las canciones. Es increíble que los responsables cometan este error, ya que la película se puede interpretar fundamentalmente en base a la letra de su música.Esto me hace pensar en algún déficit mental de los mismos. ¿Cómo es posible que el diálogo tenga subtitulo y que en cada canción el mismo se interrumpa?Espero una pronta corrección de esto."
5,Fiddler on the Roof DVD,"A classic digitally restored. Who doesn't love Topol? Best of all...you don't have to be a ""wealthy man"" to enjoy it!"
3,Bad Bass Sound!,"Here is another ""Heads up"" warning for bad sound.I HAVE THE LASER DISK AND THE DVD AND BOTH HAVE GREAT BASS. The Blu Ray has the bass way low.The best bass comparison is in the song tradition. I even turned UP the bass all the way to see if it was on my end - still low quality bass. What crap.I think most people critique the VISUAL quality over the SOUND quality and that may be. People like Scott Bosco (See The Ten Commandments) and others who really KNOW and remember sound effects need to be thanked. he is 100% correct.mike"
4,Tradition!,"Good music, humor, tradition, history, dancing, adaptability, love, hate -- this film has it all. Wonderful performances (especially by Topol) make this a must-see."
5,Collection peace,I feel this movie is a turning point in the history of cinama in the portral of jews. The we vs they senerio was used up until this movie.
2,Scratched,"I love this movie. But when we were watching it for the first time (supposedly new), half of it didn't work because it was scratched. Bummer. But the movie itself is awesome nonetheless."
4,Fiddler on the Roof,I purchase this dvd because I knew I would get it on time for Christmas and my daughter love it.
4,A classic musical,"Our family loves to watch this movie. The style is a bit dated, which is why I gave 4 stars, but I would say 5 for its time."
5,Truth in History,My favorite part of the movie is the music. I just love the Eastern Europen Jewish music and think it is important to preserve it for future generations.
5,a great story about the Jews in Russia,"This is another great classic, and very well done by all the actors. The DVD was is good shape. We have the VHS, but thought it would be good to also own the dvd."
2,"Not great picture, incredible sound","The HD picture is not up to the standard I was expecting. High contrast, poor skin tones. The remastered sound is absolutely incredible. They should remaster the picture to bring is up to par with other HD DVDs out there. For example, Sound of Music HD has amazing picture and sound."
4,"Old Fav, news format","If you are looking for a good movie, here it is. An old classic brought to you in a new format. The bonus cd is not a soundtrack from the movie, but songs from the 70's, not particularly pleasing to me."
5,Witty and delightful,"This is Topol being so brilliant that he really becomes a Jew in Czarist Russia. His voice and his diction are excellent, and the supporting caste are all good. It is very funny at times, and the songs are great. It shows a way of life, long lost, and with the pograms, how it was lost. This story goes from joy to misery, but ends with hope for the future. Most enjoyable!"
3,JOHN DESALVO'S COVER WAS THE BEST PART....,"I can only hope Ms Ashe improves greatly with her next effort. I gave this a 3* rating because I was too embarrassed to rate it as low as I felt it deserved. His ONLY thoughts were of bedding her, she could only think of what it would be like bedding him and HATING him at the same time. Even the horse ""raped"" her mare or one can assume he was DUMB enough to let her ride a mare in heat next to his monster destrier. Where was the story??all I read was the need for sex. I gave up fighting my way to page 150 and started another, much better book. ""Mayhap"" there was a story somewhere before the last page??? Oh well, at least I can use it for an exchange at my local used book store. Save your money, if you are curious, try to borrow it."
4,Conway Twitty's 1982 TV Special,"This DVD is of Conway's 1982 Mississippi river boat tv special. The sound quality is very nice, though parts of the 90 minute special were edited out like, Conway playing baseball with Barbara Mandrell, in fact her name is mentioned on the box, and Conway singing his latest hit at the time ""We Did But Now You Don't"" and there were some more songs sung, I remember, by Jerry Lee Lewis and Charlie Pride but this is a very nice DVD to have in any fan's collection."
3,Very Nice.....but,"Maybe I expect too much of a live concert, but I sure would appreciate excellent sound and color in this age of DVD technology. As a diehard Country music fan who has seen many many live concerts and has travelled the circuit a few times, I am at a loss why in this year of 2006 why we cant have available live concerts with these artists with digital picture and video quality. This formerly televised piece was produced in the 1980's. The DVD has excellent content with much dialogue with Conway and his distinguished guests. It shows Loretta and Tammy and Charlie Pride when they were in their mid career's. The audio quality is terrible with the ever present hiss of the 8-track tape technology. Although disappointed I will keep this piece for its nostalgiac look at a few of my favourite artists while in their prime."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"Very disappointed!! Not worth watching!!! Can't ""Q"" the songs!! Sings with Tammy with just a guitar backing them up while sitting at a table. One ""short"" black and white clip from Bandstand singing ""It's Only Make Believe""!!Save your money!!!Bob"
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered the replacement shoulder strap based on the description as using metal hardware. When I received the shipment, the strap length adjusting buckles were plastic. Also, the item is named Roadwired on the website, but that name was not on the package, which was Skooba. I do not intend to use Adorama in the future."
4,"G R E A T...B O O K....,,,,,,.P L E A S E....U P D A T E !","I bought this book some time back -- but it was mistakenly thrown out, so now I'm buying another copy. It's a great book, not only for informationm, but for dreaming about going to casinos outside your local area...(WAY outside your local area!)The info COULD be a bit more complete, (how many roulette tables ARE there in EVERY casino?)....but it's a lot better than nothing! There is a page inviting readers to send in extra info....but as this excellent guide is no longer being published, (at least at this date), it seems pointless for readers of the book to send in the info....unless, of course, it is included with a letter asking that this guide be republished and updated!A book for info, a book for dreaming....and why not?Please update this EXCELLENT guide!!!!!"
5,Very Impressed with this book,"If you are a ""do it your selfer"" you need this book. In my opinion, the title is no accurate. This book contains much more than just info on how to build small buildings. It includes how to build a good fence, how to build a smoke house, how to wire a two way switch, ect. It contains everything that is not common knowledge to the common man, and it has lots of pictures. If you live on the farm and do most things yourself, this book is a required tool."
5,Great Building Information,This is one of the best books I have seen for information of how to build for any DIYer. The pictures are clear and very well labeled. I wish I had bought this book before I started building my house and barns. I would have done a lot of things differently. Buy informational books before you build anything! Learn from other people's mistakes.
2,small barns,I was under the impression that it had COMPLETE plans It shows you bits and pieces of the constrution .The book itself (for being used was in ex condition almost new condition).all in all it was worth the 8.00 bucks
2,Not what I thought it would be and probably my fault.,"I was looking for a book that would give me IDEAS for small buildings, but this book was more instruction for builders than for ideas. I was disappointed in it, but if you are looking for a how-to for DIY, it could be for you."
2,Recorded From the Wind Chest?,"I work in Philadelphia and have heard the Wanamaker organ many times. It is truly a majestic sounding instrument. But the unusually high noise floor in this recording is distracting (except in limited passages where Mr. Conte plays at greater volumes) and, for me, compromises the musical experience."
3,Not a fancy napkin,I found this book while taking care of other details at work and found myself highly amused and extremely fascinated by the details that went into this particular art.One has to have a bit of a sense of humour regarding a few of the things created in this book and some patience when attempting to make them.I found that the directions were not that clear nor concise but the photographs/pictures were helpful when trying to figure out what the next step might be.Also make sure to use a piece of paper that has some weight to it; even if you do not have any origami paper when you attempt some of the projects.A hilarious book and project to bring out at parties!
2,really hard... twss!,i wouldn't recomend this other than a gag gift. the instructions are really difficult and hard to follow. otherwise its funny.
5,Very cute book,"I have not MADE any of these - but the book is very interesting to look at. It really is not ""porn"" My daughter accidentally saw the cover and did not even know what it was!!Great adult conversation book!! Would make a great party game also."
2,Great concept - not such a great book,"This book is a novelty and the concept is funny. However, I'm not impressed with the models.The diagrams are pictures of somebody showing the folds - so the book does not use the ""normal"" symbols.I think a beginner folder would have some problems with this book."
2,Dissapointed,"I really wish this seller would have described more in depth the condition of the book. I received the book and it came in a 3-ring binder notebook...Seriously? I needed the book for a class so I did not return it but If I would have known what I was buying, I would have bought from someone else."
1,Where is my book????????,The only thing I can say is that I have not gotten y book yet!!!!!!!!!!!!! THAT IS JUST NOT RIGHTIt has been a month and I don't know who I need to contact about the situation.Avigai a very unsatisfied customer
3,Chet Atkins plus,"Was a little disappointed in this DVD because it didn't have much on it with Chet Atkins. It was good, but mostly other folks and just a little of Chet."
3,A Tribute - Not a Performance by Chet,"There's no bigger Chet Atkins fan than yours truly, and I am more than happy to see him paid tribute all the live long day. Just be aware, though, that this DVD has very little biographical data, and very little of Chet performing. When he does perform, it's with a muzzle, not with fangs bared. So to speak, of course. It was enjoyable to see a cast of characters I haven't seen in a long time, i.e. those paying tribute, so it is a nice trip down memory lane in that respect. No technical discussions about his playing or his guitars, though. What it is, or was, was a single TV special with a bunch of Chet's friends coming on stage to chat and perform. If you are a Chet fan I recommend you get it, but only with the right expectations - it's a terrible feeling to be disappointed in anything associated with mein lieber Chet."
2,Not his best,"This is not one of his best shows. A little draggy (excuse that), unfocused, and just really not as good as some of theothers. I wanted to get the DVD, and we got half way to 3/4 of the way through it and went and did other things. If you're an Eddie Izzard fan, it's a must have. If this is you're first time, do ""Dressed to Kill""."
4,Very good show,"I own the UK version of this DVD and can highly recommend it. Although not as good as 'Dress to Kill', Eddie still gives a strong performance with plenty of humour and laughter. The extra of him and his Dad touring his Father and Grand-Fathers old houses is very interesting and quite charming. A very good buy in my oponion."
3,Izzard Sexie,"I think I have all of Eddie's work in one form or another; he's my favorite transvestite comedian. However, this is not Eddie's best work. The DVD would be better...there's too much ""visual"" comedy on this CD; you can only guess at his sound effects."
5,a must for curls/waves,"Great for curly or wavy hair--keeps the waves, not the poof. Love it, even works in Florida and anyone who's ever been here knows how humid it is here most of the year!"
3,Heavy rocker takes on the blues. No one wins.,"Well, I don't doubt that Gary Moore means well, and on the back of the late eighties blues revival this crossover effort certainly sold well, but, for all Moore's respectful hat tipping to his elders and betters, 'Still Got The Blues' sounds like an old seventies rocker who sure wishes he had the blues, but hasn't. ... But while Moore is a great guitar player, being a great blues musician is a whole lot more than that, and you can't just switch to it overnight. This is most obvious when he really cuts loose: you know you're listening to a top-flight, but unreconstructed, heavy rocker: large Marshall set to eleven - the blues it ain't. This isn't to say Moore can't be devastatingly soulful, but nothing here comes close to his beautiful single from the 1970s 'Parisienne Walkways'."
2,Will disappoint blues fans,"This album features some real nice guitar work. However this is album is more pop than the blues. I personally am not much into pop music - as a result this album left me disappointed.This album can appear bland and almost synthetic. If Electric blues artists like Micheal Bloomfield, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Buddy Guy or Eric Clapton interest you - you probably want to give this album a pass."
2,Made it about 12 seconds in,"I just popped this CD in and popped it out about as quickly. I gave track one about 12 seconds and track 2 about 4 seconds before I heard all I needed to hear. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad CD, but calling it ""blues"" is a bit of a stretch. He may be playing some blues standards but the sound is very much hard guitar rock."
1,Still got the blues,"My Uncle recently loaned this CD to me. All I can say is it is obvious Gary Moore ate too many lead paint chips as a child and has no concept of real blues music. The reason for this harsh review is that my uncle was a member of a harshly reviewed band by Gary Moore himself and my uncle before the review considered Mr. Moore a wonderful and talented artist. BUT, after reading his review of Frost music, one of Detroit's premier groups of the late sixties and seventies, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. Moore has obviously lost more brain cells than we had originally anticipated. Either that or his near fatal accident affected his ability to review music competently!!! Thankyou"
5,Gary's Still Got It!,"Oh, this is a nice one! Gary's guitar playing and singing are like velvet - crushed velvet."
3,Good,"This first effort by Gary totally into blues is a good one, with Gary's astonishing voice as powerful as ever. But, I prefer his rock days."
4,"Better than Kitchen Confidential, not as good as Medium Raw","Very enjoyable read for any foodie or fan of Anthony Bourdain. You can really see his continuing growth as a writer. What a great voice on the page, easy to recommend!"
5,Gonzo-gastronomic Writing at it's best,"It's never quite clear whether Bourdain is really after the 'perfect meal' or just expanding his repertoir of local libations. Either way, he sounds like he's having a heck of time eating, drinking, and razing the Food Network crew trailing him. Not every chapter is stellar, nor is there a particularly coherent thread, but the good chapters are bitingly hilarious and will make you want to eat things you didn't know were edible!Two dictums attributed to the father of gonzo fit best: ""Never let the facts get in the way of reporting the truth;"" and ""when the going turns weird, the weird turn pro."" Bourdain embodies both as the delinquent chef-turned-author who manages to capture a piece of the soul of eating (and drinking) around the world."
5,A Salute to the Inedible,"Mr. Bourdain takes a tour through different parts of the world, mostly Asia, and lives on food most Westerners wouldn't want to look at. Yet many of the dishes and condiments he describes in loving and precise detail do make sense. Others he swallowed, I am sure, more or less on a dare. He gives us excellent chapters on the places he visits. But mainly it is the food, the hero of this book, that you can almost smell and taste. Some of the well-reasoned asides hit hard on vegetarians, on all the places where you can no longer smoke, and today's pasteurized, sanitized and emasculated mass food production.If you are curious about unusual food, then this low-calory, high-intensity book is for you. Bon appetit."
5,tony bourdain is a smart-ass (emphasis on SMART),"tony bourdain's stories of extreme cuisine are alternately harrowing and transcendent, visceral and poetic. he travels the world in search of the ""perfect"" meal - way, WAY off the beaten path. I'm happy to read about his experiences because I certainly don't want to share them. an amazing book."
1,Oh dear,"As bad a book as Kitchen Confidential is good. It reads - and to some extent he confesses this in the text - as though it was written in a hurry as a bolt-on to the television series and has been rushed out for Christmas.What made Kitchen Confidential so great a read was that it was clearly written from a position of expertise and contained a lot of truth. A Cook's Tour seems to have been written because he was looking for another project after finishing the endless publicity rounds for his great success. This new book has no depth of information, frequently resorts to cliche and the obvious (eating deep fried Mars Bars in Glasgow, scoffing haggis which has been introduced into the room by a bagpiper) and certainly does little to convey a love of food.Personally I find his expletive scattered writing style a little grating out of the kitchen...this book has a lot more Fu**s than any of his previous works and with far fewer reasons to include them.Altogether, a huge disappointment."
4,Global Gourmet!,"this was a fun, enteraining read. if you enjoy Tony's show on Food TV, then this is added excitement. After seeing a few episodes, I had to get the book. Tony's writing is as colorful as the locations.read about the Pho soup experience in Vietnam. Picture him choking down that snake's heart and blood. and finish it off with some canivore dishes in England.YUM! (I won't be having any of this on my next vacation overseas.)"
2,No flavor,"After loving ""Kitchen Confidential"" I was so disappointed in this! The descriptions are shallow and tossed off -- even of the food (we're told again and again ""this was great,"" but never WHAT IT TASTES LIKE!!) and the adventures all sound the same (all variations on ""I wanted the childhood adventure story dream but this wasn't it"" OR ""and this was it but it really scared me and wasn't fun like I expected""). Bourdain is trading on his admittedly abundant personality, but he should have taken a little time to let us in on the jokes/joy/adventure."
1,ANOTHER BOURDAIN GEM,"A CULINARY TRIP AROUND THE WORLD WITHOUT HAVING TO GET ROT GUT YOURSELF, OR ANY OTHER DYSENTERIC ILLNESS. THAT'S WHERE ANTHONY COMES IN. HE DOES THE TRAVELING AND TASTING FOR YOU. IT'S ALL WRITTEN IN HIS SPECIAL, WITTY STYLE."
5,The Glory of Vietnamese Food,"Many readers complained of the Vietnam trip being added throughout the book. Having just finished the book, it's clear that the eats in Vietnam, and the people, stood out for him. There's really something special about his writing of Japan too. This book is a riot and I am pleased that he doesn't ""dumb down"" his biting humor for the reader. Questions to him would be, 1/ Why no pictures? 2/ Why not India? Lastly, very refreshing to hear a chef give the respect to the Hispanic folks that have been cooking beautifully for years."
4,For those who can't get enough of No Reservations,"A Cook's Tour is likely my favorite book of Tony's. It does a great job showing the genesis of not only No Reservations, but of Bourdain's transition from downtrodden chef to cable TV sensation (how else can you describe him?). Frankly, I wish Tony would dedicate a book w/ a similar theme to his No Reservations trips."
5,What a Trip!,"This is a closer, behind the scenes look at Tony's experiences getting the series going and illuminating his perceptions. I read his first book and have enjoyed the episodes in the TV series. This book filled in some of the pieces for me in a personal way as Tony wrote about why he did some things, shared his reactions to people, places, food and explained the sometimes complex realities of hosting a food/travel program. As a foodie, I enjoyed the read and even more, appreciated the multi layered personality that emerged from these pages. I have not only recommended the book, but I bought it as a gift so someone else could enjoy it."
3,Inconsistent,"The thing about Portugal--the fattening and killing of the pig to using its bladder as a soccer ball--was wonderfully described. It's almost as if he brought us with him on the trip. But after that nothing really stood out for me, except his bashing (rightfully so, in my opinion) of Jamie Oliver and his memorable iguana eating experience, a hotel mascot no less, in Mexico. One can say, practically, these could have been found as chapters he discarded when he wrote Kitchen Confidential.Do read the book; it's still a good read."
3,Doesn't hold up,"Oh please - this doesn't even compare to ""Kitchen Confidential"". Sorry Tony, but you were trying too hard. The only time I even glimpsed the Tony of ""Kitchen Confidential"" was when you were skewering the Food Network. I know you sold out - but jeesh, were you writing a travel book, a cook book, or a political statement? You lost your focus! Gimme the underbelly! Come and cook in my kitchen and then we'll talk."
5,Unbelievable!!!!,"The best way for me to describe Chef Bourdain's antics is unreal and incredible. I must admit to an overwhelming twinge of jealousy that a feat like this was accomplished and recorded first hand, and that I wasn't there to behold its magnitude and non stop insanity.His writing style, unpolished, vivid and direct, at times moved me from tears of hysterical laughter to deep contemplation, like an out of control pendulum.A published record of adventure beyond imagination in this day of globalism and CNN; that delves below the layer of politics and shows us the people living under said layer is rare indeed.But to eat your way around the world, what a gluttonous pleasure to indulge in.Thank you Chef Bourdain for sharing this adventure with us, even if you did sell your soul to the devil. It was, after all, for a good cause."
2,More a bemused travelogue,"This book doesn't evoke hunger, or foodie delight. It's a semi-abashed (because he's traveling with a camera crew, and has to cooperate) account of him going around the world seeking food without often finding it.This is not a terrible book. It just doesn't measure up to the standards set by any other foodie book I've ever encountered.Pick another at random and you'll have a more enjoyable and more educational read. If you already have this book, read it once and then (you will anyway) give it away and move on to a different author."
5,so jealous!,"What a rollicking good adventure, and I appreciated his upfront admission that this trip was possible due to the wild success of Kitchen Confidential which he calls 'obnoxious' (in the best possible way, say I) and the fact that the Food Network was footing the bills and greasing the wheels. Wow, whose lamp do you have to rub to get that kind of sweet deal? He's such an endearing personna on the page that I can't begrudge him landing my dream ... I just wish it came with a tasting sampler.I loved this book, even when he's busting on my vegetarian kind - I appreciated his description of the Portugese pig slaughter too - honest and complex and I knew that the tofu alternative I'd be stuck eating wouldn't taste nearly as good as the rustic whole hog feast he partakes of a few pages later.Write us another one, Tony!"
4,An Enjoyable Look into Cooks and Foreign Locales,"This book is a journal of Anthony Bourdain's travels across to try new foods. He travels a varied and sizable portion of the world, with each chapter describing a new location and new foods to eat. It is worth noting that this book was written during, and is the perfect complement to the show ""Cook's Tour"" on Food Network.This book is quick, fluid, and enjoyable. He delves into details that are fascinating, such as the history of a certain city, the rise of Mexican chefs, his French summer home, the dangers of Cambodia, and so much more.All in all, it's a great little read that mixes a little bit of history, cooking, multi-culturalism, and Bordain's opinionated sayings. Nothing spectacular, but a good fun book."
4,Calf Cheeks and Iguana Kabobs,"Although not as engaging as ""Kitchen Confidential"" ""A Cook's Tour"" is a fun jaunt around the gourmet globe. Traveling near (San Francisco) and Far (Cambodia) Bourdain chrinicles his tasting of local food and sipping of local drink.If you are a ""foodie"" or restaurant junkie, you may be put off by this book as it will not tell you the best restuarants to visit or the best chefs to look up. This book is all about the FOOD.And, although I would not eat half the things Mr. Bourdain put in his mouth, reading about it something I savor."
3,"Some good stuff in there, but overall just average book. And animal lovers beware","I am a big Anthony Bourdain fan. I couldn't wait to get this book. I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of it, although some of the slaughter descriptions were a bit disturbing (I love animals). There were some truly moving chapters in there and some very interesting stuff. However, it really started to slow down after a while. Each chapter seemed pretty much like the chapter before. I guess that is to be expected, but it really got less interesting. And the descriptions of animals being slaughtered started to get to me after a while. I have maybe 1/4 of the book left and I'm not inclinded to pick it up anymore. Felt like he was just trying to fill pages for some of the chapters."
2,NOT KC2 AND TOO MUCH POLITICS!,"While ""A Cook's Tour"" includes descriptions of interesting places, people and some bizarre meals, it simply doesn't hold up to the raw impact of ""Kitchen Confidential."" I enjoyed Anthony's passionate writing about his experiences in Vietnam, but I didn't like his extremely liberal slant on the Vietnamese maimed and injured during the war. Anthony, we lost 50,000 young men trying to provide freedom for the Vietnamese people and the leaders of the old VC that you so enjoyed eating with were responsible for the murders of thousands of their own people after the war was over...."
2,"""Culinary Holy Grail !' ... I don't think so !","A globial adventure in extreme cuisines...INDEED! Asking the question, ""What would be the perfect meal?"" Bourdain ""Kitchen Confidential,"" newest book, ""A Cooks Tour,"" is a joke at best. Going from one EXTREME to another made little or no sense at all to me. From Asia to Europe, Africa, and, parts of the U.S.A and god forbide I forget to mention Harry Kissinger and Bourdain's comparison of Cambodia to Vietnam all in the name of CULINARY JOURNALISM ! HELLO, Mr. Doofis, I thought I was going to get a few interesting ideas on ""WHAT THE PERFECT MEAL WOULD BE,"" not an adventure in ""AS YOUR STOMACH TURNS !"""
1,It's a hangover,When I buy a cook's book it's to learn about exquisite cuisine food of different places culture and not to learn about different hangovers of the writer
5,Sehr gut!,"Legionaere is a very good cd considering how long ago it came out and that it is all in German.Anyone fimiliar with Enigma, should not buy this with hopes that this is another Enigma cd. It is nowhere near Enigma.It is your typical 80 rock cd, but in German.Songs such as Spiel auf Zeit, Total Normal, and Der Planet Der Verlorenen Zeit are excellent.The only drawback is that you can't really sing along to it..."
3,Cretu's first solo project,"This is Michel Cretu's first solo project, pre-Enigma where all the lyrics are in German and it is sung in German which is a bit of a drawback for me as I don't understand German. However the sound and style of the music is beautiful. This album was originally released in 1983 and this style of music back in that time fit well in the Euro-pop/rock scene.The song's 'Total Normal' & 'Data-Alpha4' are the highlights of this interesting Cretu produced album."
3,Winters Bane - Girth,"Girth is the follow up of Heart of a Killer, but without Tim Owens ( now frontman of Judas Priest ). Musically the Album rocks, but the vocals lack the power and tecnique of Owens. I believe the guitarrist is singing; he sings well but after someone like Owens I feel they sould have gotten another gifted singer. I read that at this time they are looking for a new singer in the vein of Tim Owens, so their next CD sould once again deliver the goods."
5,great Megadeth akbum!,"as a previous reviewer said, this album is awesome and Megadeth should have released it, this is kinda true toe vox are Mustaine all over lol. Winters bane is an awesome band and the newer album is the best yet!!"
1,Horrible product will never buy memorex again!,"I had a bunch of video's(avi's mpegs) in my comp that I wanted to back up, so I decided I would use some of these dvd-rw's to back them up. BIG MISTAKE! So far 2 dvd-rw's out of the 6 I have recorded have stopped functioning. My dvd-rw won't read them due to a ""corruption"" error, and I haven't even reused this disc!!!! Incredible that after one burn it's already giving out!!! I'm soo mad...I will never trust memorex ever again! Horrible product! Don't bother using this for storage, because they WILL stop functioning...trust me."
4,THE ONLY DVD-RW BRAND I USE.,"FOR SOME REASON, MEMOREX BRAND I FIND ARE THE BEST. I HAVE USED THE DVD-RW'S OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH VERY LITTLE PROBLEMS. OF COURSE, WHEN YOU RECORD THEM TOO MUCH PICTURE QUALITY STARTS TO BECOME NOTICABLE. IT'S A SHAME, I CAN ONLY FIND THEM ONLINE. RADIOSHACK DOES NOT EVEN CARRY THEM ANYMORE. BE AWARE, JUST BECAUSE IT SAYS DVD-RW, THEY ARE NOT ALL THE SAME. MAKE SURE THE 2X 4.7 IS LISTED ON THE LABEL. SOME SAY, 4X ON THE LABEL, THEY DO NOT WORK ON MY DVD RECORDER. THIS WAS MY FAULT, I DID NOT READ IT CLEARLY. THEY ARE DURABLE AND LAST A LONG TIME. MAKE SURE TO PUT THEM BACK IN THE JEWEL CASE, THEY SCRATCH EASILY. I ONLY GIVE IT A 4, CAUSE IT DOES NOT COME WITH A BOX, LIKE THE OLDER VERSION WHICH AMAZON DOES CARRY. THANK YOU"
1,Not universally compatable !!,I have used this _RW with my Sanyo DVD recorder. The result is that I cound not play the recording. It wil freeze up. and some times they can not be formatted. They will not function well if they are used for the VR mode. I have used other brands such as TDK or Fuji. they are OK.
5,Memorex DVD-RW Media Review,"I am very enthused about being able to purchase your product via the Internet and at a very reasonable price. It's very hard to find the correct media for my recorder at local stores, i.e. Walmart, etc.. Even Best Buy & Circuit City(Memphis, TN) don't seem to carry them. Keep up the good work. I applaud you.J. Rudd"
1,Memorex (Forget it) Dysfunctional Software,"Reads as Audio file (from a fresh disk.)Windows Media Pops up when disk is first inserted. Huh?Mis reads memory (states disk has 1.99 GB's without even being used yet.) What?Does not function for Backup source (Windows Me) Why Me?Does not format ...What?No matter which Memorex you use none of them work. I tried 3 versions of DVD+RWDisk played DVD R's from Verbatim but spit Memorex out like tobacco.This company never ceases to amaze me with the mistakes in their products from CD's to DVD's . You want to know the most popular brand on the shelf? Start by seeing the brand that's missing the most. If the shelf is over-stocked with Memorex, then it's pretty obvious people aren't buying them for a reason. Say your prayers, or buy a tent and camp outside of the store. Waste of money."
4,Very Good dvd-rw media.,I've bought these five Memorex dvd-rw on Amazon. All five of them are very good so far. To write and rewrite and rewrite on 3 disks and they are all good. I've used them with new Sharp 300U Dvd-recorder with 80GB HDD.
5,"great, simple midi solution",this thing is simple and does what it does without any drama. wish that were more common. i love this company's gear. problem solvers that don't create other problems.highly recommend...
5,Works flawlessly,"I have owned and used this product for over 6 years, and it has worked flawlessly for me. It does what it claims to do, is extremely reliable, and requires almost no setup. If something were to happen to it, I would buy a new one immediately."
1,No need to read beyond the title,very short book... not even funny author rants about getting back at people who wrong you but without any substance or story.. he siply places the how to in the chapter line and then talks about how they will squirm from your revenge... This is a pointless book like a joke without a punch line don't waste your money and disregard the pre-canned reviews above.
1,bad for christie,i have read 20 books of christie and i did not this book . this book is very humdrum.
2,Weakest So Far,"Of the thirty-two Christie novels I've read, this one is the weakest. I couldn't even bring myself to finish the last chapter. It is definitely an attempt to create a drawing-room flapper novel. It is even a little hard to keep some of the characters straight. Not that there weren't possibilities, but this production was too long for what little plot was really there."
3,One of her older books and a bit dated now,"Agatha is Agatha but this is a weak effort from today's perspective. It has the feeling of a gone by age of fops, lie abouts with good hearts, dashing young aristocrats with no money, etc. and so on. Suspect Brits would find it better--doesn't translate as well overseas."
4,Another volume for casual X-Files fans,"The second volume in the X-Files Mythology series focuses on the Black Oil aspect of the series. Compiling 15 episodes from seasons 3 to 5, this volume is mainly features episodes about the parasitic, black colored oil like alien substance that can infect humans. The episodes included here: Nisei, 731, Piper Maru, Apocrypha, Talitha Cumi, Herrenvolk, Tunguska, Terma, Memento Mori, Tempus Fugit, Max, Zero-Sum, Gethsemane, Redux, and Redux II, are all excellent and just about classic X-Files episodes that are compiled here for a cheap price, which is what makes the X-Files Mythology series worth owning for casual X-Files fans who don't want to shell out the money for complete season sets. If you are a die hard X-phille, you're better off with the season sets which include all the great stand alone episodes (where as the Mythology sets revolve around the series' single storyarc), but other than that, this is a solid deal for casual X-fans."
4,The Meat and Potatoes Of The Series,It's been interesting reading the reviews of the X-Files Mythology series. The die hard fans love it all. THe purists find fault in episodes not included. I was out of the country during the X-years and appreciate this whole set of 4 topic driven collections. I can watch the sets one at a time and get a good overview of the threads of the series. I think it's a good idea and will use this same review for each. bg
4,still deciding,This is a good night cream and is not greasy or heavy at all. Would like to use more of it before deciding if it's making any difference. However I do like it and will continue to use it. I have used the Robanda products before and like the ingredients that they contain. Good so far and will need more time to evaluate any difference in skin.
5,Lightweight and good on your hands,I bought 2 of these blow dryers and I use them in my salon and they work excellent. Its very light so it does'nt exhaust my arms. Would recommend to buy again.
2,Not as great as everyone says,"I bought this hair dryer having read the wonderful reviews. It took forever to come and then didn't live up to expectation. I was hoping to solve my frizz problem and speed up the drying time, but I didn't think this hair dryer did either. I sent it back and was pretty annoyed that they only refunded me $64 of the $88 I spent on it. They charged me a ""restocking fee"" and a ""shipping fee"" when I already paid $11 to send it back myself. All in all, a lousy deal."
4,Thunderthief is not Zooma part II,"After thoroughly enjoying Zooma and seeing JPJ live three times, I waited for this album with great anticipation. JPJ did not disappoint! This is a much more nuanced and eclectic album than Zooma, not relying so much on skullcrushing bass as JPJ plays more guitars and mandolin. Overall, the album is quite a bit more mellow with tracks like Freedom Song, Ice Fishing at Night and Down to the River to Pray. That being said, tracks like Leafy Meadows, the Thunderthief and Shibuya Bop will remind fans why JPJ was an essential component of Led Zeppelin's sound. Jonesy actually sings on a few tracks and his voice isn't too bad. Another great outing by one of the most talented musicians around."
1,Disappointing,"I began to watch this film because of my interest in bio-fuels. It promised bio-fuel and delivered politics. This film could have done much to put forward viable alternative fuels, and for a few minutes it did. Shortly after the start of the film it seemed to have stopped talking about alternative energy all together and began to babble about the politics of oil.I expected more science, more talk about FUEL, and less politics. That wouldn't be a problem because politics have large role in the viability of almost anything, but at this point, you can alienate 50% of people. This film, in my opinion, has a liberal bias, which can put off conservative viewers from being open to viable bio-fuels.Talking about the politics of the past is not helpful in promoting the fuels of the future.Instead of this, watch ""King Corn"" or some other similar documentaries."
3,worth watching,"Worth a watch,but nothing really new here.The biggest change that has to happen is our mindset to energy.How come when they talk of 150mpg hybrids they never seem to take into account the electricity they use? Do they get their power for free? Biodiesel is over rated,very little if any is made without fossil derived methanol,so its at least 20% fossil fuel.Virtually nothing on ethanol,except that making it from a huge monoculture crop ie corn isn't a very good idea.There are many more better ways to make ethanol,which ultimately will become our future fuel."
5,A Must See Film...,"This film is a must see for any American that cares about the future of this country. It's amazing how much the political power and back door dealings of a few wealthy corporations can shape our country's history for an entire century. I was completely shocked and dismayed by the deception and greed that got us in this mess and then pleasantly surprised by the optimism and determination of everyday Americans to change all that. Ignorance may be bliss, but knowledge is power. So if you have children, as I do, and care at all about their future, you cannot afford to miss this film."
4,Good,"It's not often that I watch documentaries but this one stuck out so I decided to give it a go. It's well done, and the creator is obviously passionate. What I appreciate about this documentary is that he does not just complain about the dependency on oil but gives suggestions such as bio diesel, solar power, etc as an alternative and gives an in depth explanation of how to use it and why.Just keep in mind that, like other documentaries, it presents one side. I suggest doing your research before signing up on a crazy green campaign."
5,Great servive and great value,I bought this for my son who worked as a journalist intern this summer for a small town newspaper. He was taking a lot of his own photos and needed a camera bag that was something he could use for his slr camera but also like a briefcase. This bag was perfect. Most camera bags are either for the professional and over kill or too smallHe loves this and it was a fantastic value!Shipping cam quick too.
1,Just not convenient,"I accidentally bought this bag instead of the Sling Shot, which has great reviews. Unfortunately I live in Korea and bought the bag at Namdaemun market and it can't be returned...one of the problems of Korea. I assure you it is genuine, in case you wonder (it's always a good question for Asia!)My problems are:My Canon Kiss X (Rebel XT) BARELY fits in the bag with a 4"" lens on it and it's incredibly difficult to remove it through the ""easy access"" zipper on the top of the bag.It's not comfortable to wear, and the slider which goes through the shoulder strap doesn't move easily.My first time out shooting with it was just annoying and I think I'll end up using it just as a storage case and for travel.I really want to like this bag, but it doesn't perform well for me!"
4,TRACK LISTING (with 3 MIXES of When I Think Of You):,"Janet's 1995 single from her album Design of a Decade: 1986 - 1996. This cd single's main star, however are the remixes for Jackson's 1986 hit When I Think Of You.Track listing:1. Runaway2. When I Think Of You (David Morales House Mix ' 95 UK 7"" Edit) - wow, that's a mouthful!3. When I Think Of You (David Morales Classic Club Mix)4. When I Think Of You (David Morales Jazzy Mix UK Edit) Don't let the word ""Edit"" dissuade you. This mix is over 10 minutes long!!!!"
1,BEWARE OF RUSSIAN OVERDUBS,There was no indication on the Amazon page that this is a Russian overdub of an Italian comedy classic.Hence a birthday present to my Auntie turned out to be an unexpected dissapointment.Correspondence with the (seller) was also one of the most dismal experiences in my ten years of purchasinggreat products through Amazon.
4,REALLY DOES END PAIN!,I first started using for fibromyalgia symptoms & lower back pain. My mother in the meantime is using for arthritis pain. We have both experienced reduced pain while using this product. I highly recommend checking out the product line of Enzymatic Therapy.
2,End Pain,"I took this for about a month but did not see any difference from it. I was so hopeing that it would help, I would not waste your money on it."
5,Wonderful Natural Pain Relief,I saw this product on the Ricky Lake show and gave it a try after having knee surgery. It does help with the pain and allowed me to sleep at night without the pain I had been experiencing.
1,disappointed,"I've suffered from chronic pain for almost 20 years from a serious injury, it gets worse when the weather is colder, so I was very hopeful this product would be helpful. I hate taking prescription painkillers because of the side effects, but will keep looking for natural alternatives, this product didn't make any difference in my pain level."
2,"Love the book, but this product was not effective","The Fatigued to Fantastic book was very interesting and had some great advice. I had high hopes for this product, but sadly did not feel any pain relief even when using it exactly as directed in the book."
2,Has this author heard of examples?,"This book is for someone who has never written a paper and has the time to complete the book as a workbook. Unfortunately, this did not apply to me. I have written many papers but have always used MLA style. I know how to write a paper and only wanted help with the format. What I really needed to see was examples of how to cite a journal, a book, a newspaper article, ect. and this author only gives a description."
1,Not what I wanted,This book is not very thorough in providing information for APA. I had to purchase a different book that included step by step information about citations. I need examples and this book did not do the trick.
5,Heartwarming!,One of my favorite Christmas specials; it actually makes me cry if I haven't seen it in awhile!
4,Good book for Spring!,"This is a really cute book. A little girl finds a seed, plants it, and then cares for the sunflower that grows. At the end of the summer, she gets the seeds from the sunflower and later shares them with her class so that they can grow more sunflowers the next year. It's a simple story but one that is perfect for this time of year and would be a great starter if you are going to garden with your child."
4,Very refreshing,"Charles and Francis Hunter are very credible Christians, what they write, you can believe happened. This book gives very exciting and encouraging testimonies of what the Hunters have encountered. Especially Good book for non-angel believers."
4,"Angels, unaware?",I enjoyed this book and now have a better understanding of the spiritual realm. It has helped me to pray with more understanding.
3,Nowhere Else on Earth,"In somewhat of an anomaly for Humphreys, this work of historical fiction is set in North Carolina in 1864, where the Lumbee Indians (descendants perhaps of Raleigh's ""Lost Colony"") are being harassed by Southerners to help build Fort Fisher. A local band known as the Lowrie Gang rebels; in addition, there's a love interest between Lowrie and Rhoda Strong, an Indian, who foresakes Lowrie for her people. I felt Humphreys's strenghths as a writer, especially her strong characterizations, were weakly displayed here; historical fiction does not seem to be her forte. Much better are her contemporary novels."
2,Down and Out in Robeson County,"I read this book from first page to last, never able to quite put my finger on its pulse. In 1864 the Civil War raged in its 4th year and the ""macks"" were separatists with zero tolerance for their neighbors in Scuffletown, who hid their eligible young men in the swamp. The macks (Mac this and Mc That), the Scots planters who were original settlers of the North Carolina land, were in constant opposition with the indiginous people of the land. The landscape of Scuffletown changes like shape-shifters, as these proud Indian descendants move from place to place.Rhoda Strong, daughter of Cee, tells this rambling tale of good vs. evil. We follow as she makes life-choices and committments that seem irreversible. Basing her decisions on the attitudes of this poverty-riddled family, she seems proud of two questionable virtues: stubborness and ignorance."
2,A falling off,"I adored ""Dreams of Sleep"" and was, frankly, indignant when I read Gail Caldwell's review in the Boston Globe that called this ""paint-by-numbers fiction."" Having read the book, however, I'm inclined to think Caldwell got it right-- a 10 for historical research; for imagination, fictional accomplishment, a 5, at best."
2,A disappointment,"Josephine Humphreys, a shrewd observer of the contemporary psyche, apparently wanted to push her talents in a new direction with this historical novel. While it is admirable she ventured into new territory, the result of her risk-taking is disappointing -- and nearly non-literary. At times ""Nowhere Else on Earth"" reads like a romance novel. You've met all these characters before, from the Plucky-Independent-Heroine-Who-Is-Ahead-Of-Her-Time to the Handsome-But-Dangerous-Antihero. The historical details are interesting and the book is rich in atmosphere and emotion, but the characters are straight out of Creative Writing 101. Too much of this will destroy brain cells. My advice: Read ""Fireman's Fair"" or one of Humphreys earlier, better works and wait for her next book. And cross your fingers she's gotten this period novel thing out of her system."
4,"Good writing, good read","If you love a beautifully written story with a strong central character and plenty of fascinating historic detail, you will enjoy this book. Rhoda's observations about the world around her are sheer poetry and immerse the reader in a remote and unusual community worth knowing about. The other characters are, unfortunately, too numerous and too hastily drawn for the reader to become fully invested in their fates. But if you are a writer, or just love good writing, you will not regret the time you spend in Rhoda's world."
2,More flute please...,"This cd is very ""loud"" chinese music. I prefer soft background flute and whispy melodies. This cd is sometimes too metalic."
5,A good anthology of the Chinese folk music...,"I have been interested in ""World Music"" before there was such a title. My record collection of years ago (LPs) included any albums I could find of ""folk music"" from all parts of the world. I became especially interested in the soothing sounds from China and Peru.This collection is a good anthology of the Chinese folk music with liner notes that provide us ""Occidentals"" with some understanding of the context. Especially after traveling to China, my fascination with the ""Middle Kingdom"" has continued to grow.See also: Melody of China"
2,Misled,"I had thought this product was a full sized notebook, I guess it's my own fault for not looking at the dimensions. It's quite pretty though!"
3,decorative notebook,"needed to add about .50 cents to order to get free shipping, the product is cheap enough, smaller than expected but served the intended purpose."
3,Too small,"I bought a few of these notebooks when I was shopping for school supplies, so I thought it would be a standard 8.5x11 size. In reality, it's only 4x6. Too small for a journal. I was surprised, and probably would not have purchased it, had I known. If you don't mind the size, it's a cute notebook."
4,Good-quality ring at a fair price,"I bought this ring for my girlfriend. She's been wearing it for about nine months now without any problems. The ring is attractive, and she's received some compliments on it. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase, and my girlfriend seems to like it, as well."
3,OK,"A BIT SLOW BUT NICE. SOMETIMES HE CRYS LIKE A BABY. OVERALL I LIKE TEDDY. THE BEST SONG IS ""LOVE HER FOR THAT"""
3,A few exceptional songs,"I bought this CD on the strength of ""Wake Up"" which I thought was just a fantastic piece of song writing. The rest of the disk was a little underwhelming in the knock my socks off sense. But as with many albums repeated listening brings forth a few gems that I really, really like. ""All we Said"" and ""So Easy"" are very nice songs and have made it to my iTunes/iPod rotation. It's also a thrill to hear Richard Thompson's guitar work on several tracks. 3 stars is not a knock against this CD - I rarely ever give 5 stars to anything unless it is absolutely stellar."
3,Undecided on product,"I got this product for my three wolf hybrids. It seems to have helped my oldest male but not the female and the pup is undecided. I have given them three pills a day in a can of dog food for about two weeks now. So I am still undecided, I have a full bottle yet to give them to see if it helps the female. She might have gotten to bad off before I saw the advertisement for Cosequin."
5,Great Product,"Excellent product with an excellent price. Fash shipment, thank you very much. Will purchase from you again when these are gone."
5,"Same thing our vet prescribed, but much less money","One of our dogs has a pre-artritic condition. Our vet suggested this product and we bought the first dosages from our vet's office. Near the end of the bottle we looked and found it via Amazon at a much more economical price.The product itself is easy. Open a capsule and dump it on their food(dry in our case). Both of our dogs have not changed their eating habits since we started using it so it appears not to affect the taste. Our male Border College scarfs his food so the change is not a good test, but our female Australian Shepherd is a picky eater and she eats the same amount before and after.The only change we noticed is their stool is much firmer. Both had well-formed fesces before hand, but now it is even firmer. Picking up poo is no fun, but when it is not runny it is much easier."
5,Good product,"I have 2 American bulldogs. 1has knee problems. The vet recommended cosequin. I Was skeptical at first but desperate, so I bought it. I now give it to both my dogs. I noticed an improvement about 3/4 of the way through the 1st bottle. A severe limp to very slight. Now after a few bottles no limp. A good product."
5,does help with arthric pain,"I do highly recommend this product for dogs with any arthric pain,I do the method of 3 caspules a day for a 55 pound dog,I will stay on this does till I see physical changes in a dog,less limping/easier getting up persay,at this point when I do see less limping/easier getting up up to 75% at least I then will lower dosage to 2 capsules a day,when and if I see even better results I then will go to a steady dosage of 1 capsule a day,,,,though if limping/difficulty getting up increases,I will jump back up to 2 capsules a day,the dosage will always depend on how well the dog is doing,when their are NO benefits with this product it is absolutely a trip to the vets for further testing,,you can always go up to 4 capsules a day also and then start lowering dosage till your dog is 100% where they are happy/less pain,,,but needless to say if your dog is not getting better please seek the advice of your Veterinarian,best of luck."
5,Great product for my dogs,"Thanks for making it so easy for me to give my german shepherds these great supplements. They enjoy them everyday as a treat, no trouble having them take their daily dosage with this chewable tablet"
5,Miracle Drug,"My dog has been on this stuff for about a year. Prior to starting Cosequin he was clearly having hip joint issues. After a walk he'd have a hard time getting up after laying down, but after only 3 weeks on this he's been basically cured. It was an incredible change! Not just an improvement, but a cure as far as I'm concerned."
5,Cosequin DS,I have a 8 year old Lab that has arthritis. This product helped herto walk and play. She was down for about 2 weeks and then I startedthe Cosequin DS. It took about week before she started getting up and around. This product worked so well on my dog that highlyrecommend it.
5,Joint medicine,Have been getting Cosequin for Roxie (Rotti Shepherd mix) for many years. Began after she had surgery on both her hind legs (knees). Found it is an effective joint lubricant and is helping to prevent arthritis in the joints.
4,Seems to be helping...,"It took over a month to build up, but has certainly helped my dog with his hips. He's only 5 so I was surprised and concerned when he was having issues. But.. he's a Shepherd who are notorious for having bad hips. He's just about back to normal, but I think I need a bit more time to fully ascertain his progress. Either way, I recommend this product if your dog is having hip issues."
2,Ordered the Wrong Stuff!,"I usually buy the Cosequin DS that you can just put in the dog food. I didn't look at this close enough when I ordered it (totally my fault), but this product you have to break open the pills and sprinkle the Cosquin over it. Which is not a big deal in itself, but just adds more more time to the mixing and stirring and pouring that we already do with the dog food. That being said, I have no problem with the product itself - it works well. I just prefer the other ones."
1,Dissapointed,"While I have no one to blame except myself, I didn't realize that these are capsules (as opposed to tablets). I've been giving my dog the tablets for 4 years now and they do work, but trying to give him a capsule(like they give to humans) my dog says 'NO WAY JOSE"" Why would they even make these as capsules is beyond me............And because I opened the container.....I'm stuck."
5,Great developer.,I have used this developer for many years now. It provides a good level of lightening for very blonde shades. The shade I was aiming for seemed to be achieved with less time and greater result using this level. I would recommend this if you are looking to lighten your hair by two or more levels.
1,hated,Didn't do the job I wanted it to do. I have blonde hair and this didn't even lift. I am extremely agitated by this.
2,L'Oreal still tests their beauty products on animals,"I've started forcing myself to look at the companies that make the beauty products I'm considering purchasing. L'Oreal has funded great research into developing an alternative to animal testing. But it hasn't actually stopped animal testing, yet. It's close. I'm only writing this review to save someone else time in researching this. I hate having to research cruelty-free hair products."
3,this book was ok,The book seemed to be more specific towards the Eastern United States building codes. Lots of algebraic errors but there are many good examples in the book which can be followed.
1,Time to Move on!,"This album is only good if you are still living in the late 80's. They are supposedly progressive metal, but progression involves movement forward, not backward. Unless you think Helstar is the hottest ""new"" band out, try something more modern."
2,6 songs good to great; the rest just grate.,"man i don't know what he was thinking when he recorded some of these songs. the musicianship is, of course, outstanding and his voice is perfect for covering lightning hopkins, furry lewis, son house (shaker lp) but who wants to hear repeated renditions of my old dog blue? i agree with other reviewers who laud ""james alley blues"" ""richland woman"" the 2 l.hopkins songs ""katie mae"" and ""darling, do you remember me"" muddy waters' ""little geneva"" and sonny boy williamson's "" don't start me to talking."" the other songs do not merit a second listening for anything other than historical interest. the ""shaker"" cd is even worse. son house's ""death letter"" is above average, maybe even great. the rest is barely listenable. if you love the blues, particularly folk blues you will be infinitely happier with any l. hopkins cd."
2,Mick Jagger and the Planet of the Ape Men,"DJ's looking a little rough on the cover, via go to my title of the review. This picture is an accurate catalyst for the performance w/in. The dobro's and Mando's are weak substitute for raging wreckless electrix. Not much more I can say other than I fell a sleep reading lit on the floor...not to memorable...or is it...?"
5,Saw Buster at Newport Folk Festival a few weeks ago,"and he was the best thing there. Harry Smiths are perfect and Buster just lifted people out of their seats. So then I bought the CD, on Amazon of course. This is a perfect CD with not a bad song on it and well engineered to boot. I probably own just about every blues CD manufactured and this goes to the top of the pile."
5,"uniquely beautiful, nostalgic and philosophical","I have been a fan of Yuri Norshtein's work since I first saw his animation film ""The tale of tales"" at 14 years old many years ago. These animation films are very poetic, nostalgic and beautiful. They're also made using a custom-made technique that re-creates fog, perspective and facial mimics - back in the 1970s! The films are slow paced, which is rare now. I have shown and given this as a present to my friends in Spain, Denmark and USA, and they all loved it. This is the best of the best of Russian animation."
4,Slot Machines,"I actually won on slot machines, for the first time! I had my trip paid for when I flew to Vegas. The book provided a simple plan to make all the different types of slot machines easier, and this easy plan helped me when the money that I normally just donate to whatever casino I visit. It is very helpfuly knowing that your odds are pretty good--that you have a better chance to win money than all the people sitting around you. This book changed me from a table player who sometimes wins, to a slot player who always wins."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,This book (book ? more like a pamphlet) is worthless. Nothing and I mean nothing of use here. I read both pamphlets All Slots Made Easier and All Slots Made Easier 2 and they both stink.
4,Cheldorado,"Hard to find Elton John songs, worth checking out.Soundtrack fro the movie ""Road to El Dorado"""
5,Fun Read,"When Madison Finn decides to volunteer at the Far Hills Animal Shelter she has tons of fun, but her own dog Phin is nothing but upset. Then she has to deal with the fact that her friend Egg won't help on their extra credit project, and her parents fighting over who she spends the holiday with. Soon Madison is so overloaded she can't even think. Can she calm down and enjoy her holiday before it's too late?"
5,"Tracy's review of ""Thanks for Nothing""","I had really enjoyed this book. I had read some of the other books of Madison Finn, but this is nessisarily one of my favorites so far. I would recomend this book for 4th to 5th graders"
3,Thanks For Nothing!,"This is the 5th book in the series of Madison Finn. It takes place around Thanksgiving, which is Madison's first Thanksgiving without her dad.( Her parents are divorced) If you are a dog lover you'll like reading this book because Madison signs up to volunteer at the local animal clinic! This book was cool I thought."
3,jesi's thoughts,"I would totally hate having to choose between my mom and dad on Thanksgiving. Oh wait, I already do! I do think that volunteering at the animal shelter did help matters. Except I don't know how you can relieve stress when picking up dog poop! The problem is that next year, she'll have to do it all over again!"
3,"Average book, hard to find","Photo quality is average (not the best at times), basic info for a general fan, nothing too deep. Good intro to Buddy in general & short in length for those with an average interest."
5,HILARIOUS,"This game is really funny, even just with 2 players.You go around the board and stop at various ""stages"", similar to regular Life. However, you end up with jobs like a gas station manager or Mullet Barber. Along the way to the end of the game you get married, get divorced and get married yet again - and roll to see how many step children you get. There are also ""Go Redneckin"" cards that can either help or hinder your progress. The player with the most teeth at the end of the game wins.I've played this with 2-6 players and every time it's hilarious! It's a great time and demanded every game night."
3,"Ok, gets dull","This game seemed like it would be the most fun game I'd ever played. I went into it with high expectations as I played with my very-goofy boyfriend. Unfortunately, the game got dull and repetitive as you went along. It's a bit like the movie that was made too long for the subject, and would be better at half-length. A fun game in the beginning, but dull later on.The concept is hilarious, though! Some rule adjustments might save this game."
5,A fun game to play with adults!,"A great game for those who have a sense of humor! If you have had a car like the ones in the game, does that mean you are a redneck in real life? hehehe..."
5,Redneck 4 Life,"This game is so good, it'll knock yer' teeth out! Our son is a part-time Yooper college student. He and his friends could not stop laughing throughout the game. Great for family get togethers; especially, since my brother has a place in the Upper Peninsula."
4,Funny!,Once we got into the game we had a great time. This is going to be a great game at the family reunion!
5,A super fun night!,"This game is so much fun to play. I am not much of a boardgame play but this one is so fun. I laughed so much just watching my teenage daughter and friends playing it that I had to buy it and then play it for myself. I have recommended ""RedNeck Life"" to all my friends and serveral have bought it and really enjoyed it as well. so, so much fun."
3,The Game of Redneck Life,"I was disappointed when we opened the box and found out that this game isn't the same design as the regular Game of Life. No spinner, cars or little ""people"". It's a flat board with dice to roll. Other than that is was a fun alternative to the regular game."
1,waste of time,A waste of time and money.Lost interest trying to get the game goingTry the Jeff Foxworthy game. :)
5,ROTFL Fun,"After playing this game at my brothers house, I just had to own it. It is politically incorrect but if you like redneck jokes this is the game for you. It is ""laughing so hard you wet yourself"" funny. Especially when you start doing your worst redneck accent... Thanks Gutbusting games."
2,One time fun. If that,"Game play is super simple, which makes it easy for anyone to understand, but how many times can you perform the 3 steps (roll dice, read card, do what it says) before your forehead bangs into the table? There is absolutely NO thinking or significant player decisions in this ""game"". It's strictly a scripted tour through a series of jokes, and how many trips could anyone stand?One way to lessen the pain is to roll 3 dice for movement (so you move 50% faster), but better would be 4 dice, or 5 dice, or really honor your intelligence by skipping this extended bad joke entirely."
5,Outragously funny!,"Hands down, this is absolutely the best and funniest board game I have ever played! You will not regret the purchase of this if you are looking for a great time!"
2,not so funny,i bought this game based on the reviews about how FUNNY it was to play. it's ok. not worth the money
3,amusing... but LONG!!!,"It's a fun game. Well, at least the first time around. There's an amusement/novelty factor for sure. But omg, you better have a lot of time on your hands. Especially if you have a lot of people playing. We had 6 people, and only made it through 3 sides of the board before everyone was ready to kill themselves. It was just taking too long - and that was using 2 dice!!! I can't imagine trying to play with only 1."
5,Review of Redneck Life,We have never laughed so hard playing a board game! We had so much fun I ordered two more games so we would hall have one! It is the funniest! Some parts might be rated PG13.
1,Let The Music Play Single,Totally disappointed! These mixes all have the same too fast beat. Every track sounds like repeticious robot music. The original songs were totally destroyed!!!!! What a waste. Buy the original LP on CD instead. Be wary of re-recordings done by the artist years after the original masterpieces.
3,Disappointed,Not as good as I thought it would be. A couple of the songs are ok but nothing beats the original version of Let The Music Play.
2,outdated,I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture. This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure. If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it.
3,Bad copy,"Several classmates also ordered this book online, but they chose a different, better version. This one is filled with formatting and spelling errors as if someone used a scanner with word recognition software to make this copy. My recommendation if you need this book for class: keep looking"
1,Savarona,"I agree with this guys ex-wife. He can't do anything right.Hope he wasn't as bad a diplomat as he is an author. Maybe he should go back to bartending. The old adage that ""If you don't know a subject teach a course about, if you still don't know write a book about it"" totally failed here! It was a total waste of time and money."
2,disappointed,"The handle was uncomfortable to hold while punching papers, and after a little over a month of moderate use in my classroom (by myself only - students did not touch it) the handle bent and eventually broke off! Now it's essentially useless because the broken metal handle is uncomfortable to hold onto. I contacted the manufacturer a few days ago and have not heard back. Since it's past Amazon's month-long return window, it was a waste of $25."
2,Handle bent and broke after 3 months,"I've only owned the product for 3 months; and the handle bent and then broke. As a teacher, I used this whole punch almost daily, 30 sheets at a time. If you need a large capacity and quality punch, look someplace else."
2,made in china junk,"Yes, it can punch 32 sheets, but I had a hard time keeping the paper guide in place at 11 inches. As a result, my punched holes were routinely misaligned. If you are a stickler for quality and perfection, this is not the hole punch for you. Hole punch also includes free oil residue, metal shavings, and fingerprints fresh out of the box."
2,Listing to port...,"Pros: Okay print, no dings on the frameCons: Print was placed askew in the frame and not centered, definitely over priced, and what's with the uneven white space around the picture?"
2,"Interesting read, but grossly misleading","While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with ""questionable"" character traits. Howard Zinn's book ""A People's History of the United States : 1492-Present"" gives a much more truthful account of the Spanish invasion of the Americas. While Columbus did achieve many things for Europe, should he be villianized, idolized, or both? Joseph Stalin did a great many things for the Soviet Union. He industrialized Russia, improved the economy, unified the nation-states of Eastern Europe, and mobilized & strengthened the Soviet Army. He also slaughtered 3 million civilians. You be the judge..."
3,A couple songs are a definite ***** (5 stars!),"I'm hardly Jewish, but ""Ride Em Jewboy"" and a couple others make this record well worth the buy. ""Ride Em Jewboy"" is one of the prettiest songs in the world. I think I like Kinky Friedman. He's not PC (a plus) and he's not afraid of his own testosterone (a definite plus). At the same time, his songs reveal a sensitive soul, a real gentleman."
5,I love the Kinkster,"In this day and age, when gross-out jokes pass for comedy, it's a pleasure to come across an artist who is able to mix satire with sincere feeling. He's funny and his social commentary is unbeatable. I especially love ""They ain't makin' Jews like Jesus anymore,"" and ""Highway Cafe."""
4,surprisingly excellent,"Tried reading one of Kinky's books and hated it, but enjoy him on Imus so thought I'd try the CD. Many good performances, but Dwight Yoakam and Lee Roy Parnell top my list. Not quite a five-star because of ""Ol Ben Lucas"" and this version of ""They Ain't Making Jews..."" (And what's with ""You're Welcome Kinky? "")"
4,Unbelievable!,"I came to be a fan of Kinky's songs through Don Imus's radio show. I bought this CD because of that, and expected your run of the mill, cookie cutter tribute album, but WOW!Superb album! All of the songs are treated with respect by the singers. This covers some of Kinky's more serious material. Best cuts are ""Autograph"" by Delbert McClinton, ""Nashville Casualty & Life"" by Lee Roy Parnell, ""Wild Man from Borneo"" by Guy Clark , ""When the Lord Closes the Door"" by Billy Swan, and ""Lady Yesterday"" by Marty Stuart.Don't miss this album!"
2,"sluggish, meandering, and unlistenable","Carlo Van Neste, he of the right on-drop dead gorgeous-P.Garnerius violin tone, plays the Vieuxtemps at a disturbingly sluggish tempo. Listen to Misha Keylin play this one on Naxos instead. The meandering, mindless, post-Romantic Ysaye Poeme elegiaque presages decades more of this music so violently rebellious of the Romantic era. Chevreuille takes this even farther, to the point of making his Concerto No. 2 unlistenable to me."
3,BIZZY,"this is a good collectors item at a small price (i paid 3$) the songs are ok and Bizzy is a little out there, but when isnt he? Bone for life!"
3,"Great Book, Horrible Editing","I love the author's approach to homeschooling, I will use a lot of her ideas. I would give this book 5 stars if every other page didn't have typos on it. I had a very hard time reading it with so many mistakes. I wondered how I could really trust something that was so poorly edited. Most of the problems were misspellings and wrong words used, but some parts were actually historically inaccurate."
1,Paper cutter - quality limited,"We have had this paper cutter in our department for awhile now. We avoid it like the plaque. It doesn't cut accurately, dots and line are uneven and not properly setup and the actual cut itself it jagged. It's a shame we didn't take this back when we should of."
3,Orphan tracks,"""Hamas Arc"" is one of the weaker Muslimgauze albums. It's still good stuff if you like Muslimgauze, but it lacks the vibe and the passion of classic MG releases, such as ""Zul'm"" and ""Veiled Sisters."" Five of the seven tracks ""Hamas Arc"" are remixed material from a canceled album called ""Shekel of Israeli Occupation."" Two others, ""Farsi"" and ""Zindabad"" are from ""Vote Hezbollah,"" which is one of the best in the entire MG catalog; these anchor the flotsam from ""Shekel."" Why was ""Shekel"" canceled? I guess Bryn Jones wasn't pleased with it and quashed it forever. He was a laconic man, not given to explanations."
3,INTERESTING,"To say the least this album is very interesting, some songs extremely relaxing others, disturbing in a Hakim Bey-ish kind of sense. Nice use of samples blend with sporadic beats and absence of melodies."
3,Helpful and informative,"Intellectual Property Infringement Damages : A Litigation Support Handbook, by Russell L. Parr, is a helpful tool for economic, accounting and law professionals. As a lawyer and certified public accountant testifying as an expert witness in an area of valuation and valuation of intellectual property and infringement damages, I found the book very helpful. After reading this book I was able to improve my presentation and testimony in the courtroom. Moreover, the book was helpful to me to better quantify my calculations on the witness stand. I find the book an essential tool for the professionals working in area of litigation support and damages."
5,Great Boot...,"I bought this boot about 3 years ago, and I absolutely love them. I have been contemplating getting another pair or having mine re-soled. I receive complements on them wherever I go, and they are the perfect height for my jeans. I would highly recommend these to anyone looking for a versatile boot. Mine are so broken in now, that I can wear them without socks and not get a blister."
3,Unrelentlessly heartbreaking and hopeless,"I'm am NOT the type of person who constantly wants escapist films with happy endings, nor do I flinch from depictions of poverty and hardship.But -- at the risk of sounding typically ""American"" and shallow (although the two are not necessarily synonymous)-- for me this movie didn't have much substance or purpose other than showing how hard life is for the Kurds in Iran. As a glimpse into another culture, it was interesting. As a dramatic film, it was dismal and empty and almost too manipulatively pathetic.Naturally, I applaud the director's first effort at raising awareness of his people, but I look forward to his maturing as a film maker."
1,1-star Cliff Notes for a 5-star novel,"The Cliff Notes guide to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is a superficial, error-riddled guide to a superb yarn of Machiavellian revenge gone astray. Although Dantés first embarks on complete revenge against his enemies, he ultimately realizes that course would also punish the ones he loves, so he leaves revenge in God's hands. That point is utterly ignored by the Cliff Notes.It is also not clear which version the Cliff Notes reviews. I am familiar with Grosset & Dunlap's 1,365-page edition, copyright 1946 by McGraw-Hill Book Company. This edition has 118 chapters, ranging from ""1. Marseilles-- The Arrival"" through ""118. The Fifth of October"". The Cliff Notes only mentions 73 chapters. If they are reviewing an abridged version, they should say so.The Cliff Notes also has many lesser mistakes, including misspelling ""Maximillian Morrel"" and ""Coclès"". If they are that careless with simple things, think what they do with complex issues!"
1,Not What I Anticipated!,"I know I should have known better when i was ordering something that was published by cliff notes, but yeah, definitely not the unabridged version like it claims. I mean the CDs are only 3 hours long. Seriously? I can't even get pass 20 chapters in 3 hours and there are like 114 chapters. I am very disappointed in this item, and to be clear, I am not disappointed in amazon, just this item. Don't get this, unless you are lazy, or you just don't like reading, cause it leaves out a lot of the storyline, kinda of like the movie. I only wanted the unabridged version, but instead got something not even close, therefore I have to award this item only one star, sorry."
5,excellent book,"The Count of Monte Cristo is a good book about romance,revenge,and cruelty!Great book for teenagers and up!Read it today!"
4,The Folly of Revenge,"Although Edmond Dantes was wrongfully accused and imprisoned this book is more a story about how hope is better than hatred. Through Edmond's life you will see how jealousy and revenge can ruin a life, even if it is what one thought they wanted."
5,Never So Few,This is my Favorite Book of Fiction OF All Times. need paperbacks to read so I don't damage my First Editions for USA and Great Britian. Thanks for the Great Read.
2,Disappointing,"I have read many,many war novels over the last 40+ years so when one reader said in an Amazon discussion forum that this was the best war novel he had ever read I had to try it. Very disappointing. It is a well written story but the jungle war in North Burma is just a backdrop to the character development of a number of men and women. Very little action here. When I read a war novel I like to go from one graphic firefight to another. This is definitely not that kind of book. The writer is very talented but this book is not my cup of tea because of the scarcity of combat scenes. Not worth it in my opinion. Definitely not the best war novel."
1,Not From Here to Eternity,"As an account of what was apparently the author's experience in Burma in World War II this book has some interest. But as a novel I thought it had little merit. I found myself being dismayed at how thick the book was and when would it end? The accounts of the romance between Con and Carla added nothing to the book, so far as I could see. The battle scenes were well-written but if they were factual, I would rather know it--namely a non-fiction account would have enabled me to know what was true and what was made up. The incident of the Chinese killing Americans, of which the author says he had first-hand knowledge--really second-hand, though--added an attention-holding portion to the novel, but that incident occupies only a small portion of the story. Frankly, I was glad when I got to the last page of this book. If you liked From Here to Eternity, I think you will be disappointed by the plotlessness of this pale imitation thereof."
4,"Good book, Needed for School, but be ready for a headache.","This book is full of great authors and amazing works of poetry. I had to purchase it for class, and the only real complaint I have is a MAJOR one (Academically). The index at the front of the book does not seem to be in any real chronological or alphabetical order. When my teacher would tell me to read Rita Dove's poem, it would literally take me ten minutes to find where she was in the massive index of poets.Other than that, great book, worth the money (for school, for recreational use: there is probably better)"
4,great introductory poetry book,This book goes through the different eras of poetry and covers how to write and analyze poetry. It is a good book for learning about poetry.
3,It doesn't compare to her previous two albums,"It doesn't have as much soul as the other two albums but at least it doesn't have too many drum machine parts either. Her voice is still great and it doesn't go for the high notes as much. The disc contains nine songs: 6 salsa songs, 2 remakes of popular songs by Cuban singer La Lupe(which are the two best songs on the disc), and a ballad version of the title track. The salsa songs (arrangements) sound weak and watered down, even the background vocals get annoying; Johnny Rivera, Huey Dunbar, and George Lamond were three of the backgound vocalists in the other albums and that formula shouldn't of changed. But she is still the best female salsa singer to date."
5,Viva La India!,"The ""Princess of Salsa"" returns with her best work to date. All songs on the album were wonderful, but I was very happy to hear her cover two classics La Lupe, the legendary Cuban chanteuse that captivated Latin music in the 1950's and 1960s. Thos two songs, ""Que Te Pedi,"" and ""Si Vuelves Tu,"" are excellent covers and India does justice in honoring Lupe's vocal style. The title track ""Sola,"" has already become a popular club track in New York and Miami, and the salsa and ballad versions are wonderful to hear. Truly India is a diva! With the recent rise of Latin music in the United States, India (who has done songs in English, especially a song for the ""Last Days of Disco"" soundtrack) will become a star in her own manner. Buy this awesome album!"
5,Simply The Best,"India's Sola CD is her best work yet! India is truly the Queen of Salsa. India rocks any song with her beautiful, strong voice. I truly love her, and I am glad that she has chosen to share her talents with the world. Keep up the good work India!"
4,Nice disc,I like this one. It is not as elementary as Dicen que yo soy. I like it a lot. It has some nice songs on it. I would recommend it. Me gusta este. No es tan basico ni sencillo como el viejo. Tiene unas canciones buenas. Se lo recomiendo.
2,"Great voice, terrible songs","I am familiar with a wide range of salsa and other Latin music, but new to India. She is without question a magnificent singer, and when given good material, she is amazing.I found Dicen Que Soy to be quite beguiling, with 3 songs that are spectacular. But the music on this album does absolutely nothing for me.Some albums take several listenings to reveal their secrets, but I like this album less each time I play it, and three has been enough.I hope this is not indicative of the albums of hers I have not heard.I guess I am alone in this opinion, but it is mine, sorry!"
1,A BEAUTIFUL VOICE...BEAUTIFUL SONGS,"SI VUELVAS TU...THE BEST....BOTH SOLAs, TOO....THE OTHERS ARE FUN AND SHOW THE RANGE OF INDIA'S VOCAL ABILITY...A WINNER!"
5,Scotch 2x3 velcro fasteners,"Used these fasteners to install an SSD drive in a computer case that does not have a convenient mounting point left for installation. The drive is light (about 4 oz.) and the velco fasteners held it securely. After 24 hours there was a firm bond, and the drive could be removed and reattached with no problems. An excellent product!"
1,Horrible,This is a horrible dvd. It looks like a home video. It is just a bunch of kids dancing cheesy scripted steps. there is no narration. The dance descriptions are just the same kids dancing with text underneath. I'm glad we borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it.
2,disappointed,"I have used other products by John Ortberg in the past and have been very impressed with the delivery and the level of teaching. The DVD for this series disappointed me. It does not contain any footage by John Ortberg. In addition to that, it seems to have a difficult time defining its audience. It goes from a video montage that seems like something I would receive as a chain email to a lecture type tensional and finally a segment that would hold the attention of Middle Schoolers. I did not feel that the video added the content I felt was needed to enhance the book study."
4,Spenser does it again!,Good book! I loved this book. Spenser & Hawk at it again! The story here was good and went back to a murder on a college campus with the black/white issue making it a real issue. I think Robert B. Parker handled a sensitive issue into a well written story.
2,Good book,very good I like Parker books never tears bad one. Hawk wasvery present in this book and I like that.
5,One of Parker's Best!,"Parker once again shines on this Spenser gem. Parker breaks his own formula when our hero is gunned down and must fight the biggest fight of his life. Spenser battles racial profiling, paralysis, and the Gray man in this excellent addition to the Spenser series."
4,An Enjoyable Experience,"Robert Parker is so dependable. I can't remember ever being disappointed in one of his Spenser novels. This was an especially good one. It's all here. The humor, clever dialog, and the characters that seem more like old friends with each book. Makes reading an enjoyable experience."
4,I enjoyed it,"I really enjoyed this book. The storyline kept moving and it wasn't completely predictable like so many whodunits. That said, it got four stars from me rather than five because of a number of cliches throughout the novel. The book is fairly short, simple, yet well-written and engaging like so many Robert Parker books. I never read the Spenser novels but really found Parker's work to be fun reads from the Appaloosa westerns. When Parker died after the fourth of that series I started backtracking to the Spenser novels to keep my relationship with his work alive. Nice read."
3,"A ""good"" Spenser is better than no Spenser at all.","A nice read, as are all the Spenser novels. They are my favorites. As such a I would recommend the book. I do not think it is the best Spenser. The older books had a harder edge, and you were not always sure how the book would end. Here I was sure, as I have been for a while with the series. I still enjoy reading them and will continue."
5,Impressive,"I am always open to new industrial bands, most of them aren't putting there all into there music but this one has so many influences and it's really obvious they enjoy what there doing. If I had to compare the sounds etc, I would have to say there a mix of X marks the pedwalk, Leaether strip, project pitchfork,and VAC. There awesome sounds and vocals are laid out really well, this whole entire album is pretty fast paced as is most industrial but more along the lines of hardcore, I was really impressed, I also got a copy of a cover they did ""little 15"" from Depeche mode, they completely made me love that song even more then I already had.This is a good buy for good music!Enjoy!"
1,Funker Vogt wannabe,"If you want to listen to Funker Vogt, then buy Funker Vogt and avoid this sad excuse of a clone. Unmelodic vocals whispered through tons of distortion & 10 songs that all sound exactly the same sums up this release. Two words: skip it."
5,Nice,"Book has great info about ancient mexican civilizations, It mentions life before the conquest and after as depicted by ancient poets that wrote what they were living at the time. Very interesting."
2,Chance: A Guide To...,"Somewhat disappointing, didn't really learn anything new. Very easy and quick read, though not that all entertaining. Was expecting more."
2,Mediocrity,Chance is unfortunately so shallow in its examination of the subject that it glances over its various topics. That would be OK if it was giving interesting anecdotes for the layman but it fails at both angles.
4,Ignorance in understanding Chance - a costly error for humanity...,"Every day, in every walk of life we have to deal with chance. One of the biggest mistakes we humans make is assigning a cause to what really happened by chance. This puts us in a vortex of ignorance, that is hard to come out of.Read this book - it will open your eyes to what all can happen due to chance. You will discover several blind spots along the way - especially with regard to trusting the outcomes of certain tests - such as one for cancer or aids.Great primer on Probability, written in an easy to understand style. It left me yearning for more, that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars."
4,Thought-provoking and Insightful,"I first heard of this little gem of a book on NPR's Fresh Air, where the author was being interviewed about it.I wrote down the author and located a copy at the local library. After renewing it several times to the limit, I realized I had to have my own copy.For those who'd like to see statistics and probability applied to real-life problems, this will prove an entertaining book.The math is not difficult, and the author explains it quite well, including why sometimes, your ""common sense"" can lead you astray.Like all good math books, this one has problems for you to work (with answers) to increase your knowledge. It also has an Appendix with references for further reading.This book was the door that led me to renew my appreciation of the value of math in our everyday lives."
2,Book needs editing.,"The basic ideas are clearly and cleverly presented. However, it is little more than a very short text with a few examples. It is distracting to find the equations clumsily presented, and there are errors of content in addition to typos. It needed a knowledgable and diligent editor."
4,"Book looks informative, but book quality was poor","The book iteslf on a quick glance looks like it would be a good reference for everything I need to know about tending to my 5 rose bushes and picking out future rose bushes, such as identifying diseases and pests.My only complaint was the actual physical quality of the book, the cover was dirty and there was green marker along the side of the binding and it looked like it had been used or in a dirty storeroom for a long time prior to shipping."
4,Wonderfully fun!,"Flaco Jimenez and friends have offered the world a very lively CD! Although I love the remake of the Beatles' ""Love Me Do,"" and the honky-tonk fun of ""A Little Drink, A Little Dance,"" I think that Flaco Jimenez's talents shine brightest on ""Desiree"" and ""Amor."""
1,Head For The Border,"This seems to be more about Dwight and Buck than Flaco. For most of the cuts, Mr. Jimenez (surely one of the most sensitive, electrifying performers in the Tex/Mex genre) appears only to be serving as a back-up musician for Yoakum, Owens, and a number of other not-very-interesting talents. This one fails on a number of levels - there is no cohesive musical theme, the songs and arrangements are lackluster, and there is not one rousing or compelling number on the whole disc.Flaco's skills are drastically under-utilized here. Que lastima (what a shame) indeed."
1,Halloween outfit,The product was poor quality. It looked cheap(NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE AT ALL). It was missing pieces of the custume. EX. HAT.
4,For pros and foodies,"Great reference books, lots of misspelling for italian words/recipes. Good to have if you're a pro or a food fanatic."
3,Larousse gastronomique,"Rated the full encyclopedia incorrectly--we bought this one for home use,but it's not as complete as we thought it would be"
2,"this is an encyclopedia on cooking, not a cookbook","for an encyclopedia on cooking this book is great, there are only a few recipes, but is loaded with terms and techniques"
4,Encyclopedic work of Gastronomy,"This book covers literally everything from A-Z in theknown Gastronomic universe, and it's strength is in itscoverage of European cuisine (esp Frech-centric foods andfood custome). I prefer the out-of-print classic editionsthat stuck more to the original scope: French-centric cuisine.The only problem with the current edition is that ittries to be all encompassing. This is a mistake, becauseit can never have the same near-flawless coverage of, forexample, Aussie cuisine that it had for French cuisine.Even with its very minor shortcomings, the LG is well worth the price."
5,This book is not for the Hamberger Helper types.......,"but if the amateur chef wants to be enlightened and take his or her skills to the next level one notch at a time, this is the book. There are techniques, recipes, definitions, in-depth instructions - just about anything the culinary enthusiast wants or needs to know, and it's all in alphabetical order. This book has been updated several times in the last 75 or so years so this is certainly not an evening's read - it is 1300 or so pages. The only thing I did not like about this book is that it was printed in China and the ink used in the printing is awful - it smells like a roof that is being tarred. I put the book outside to air out and it sure helped. For a book as sophisticated as this, I wish it would have been printed using a quality food-friendly ink."
5,The only food encyclopedia you will ever need!,"Larousse is the most thorough food encyclopedia I've seen. Some may complain that it is too Franco-centric, but all fine food has evolved from the French, so why shouldn't it be written that way? If you actually have to look up meatloaf, you probably don't belong in the kitchen. So be warned....this book IS only for truly serious cooks. But for those who take their food seriously and are willing to experience new things and expand their culinary boundaries, this book will prove indispensable."
5,The chef's bible,"This book is definitly the Chef's bible. If you're studing in a culinary school this book is a must! It's so complete, remember being chef isn't just cook nice, being a chef means have knowledge, knowing why food has reactions, why we have to cook in certain ways, etc... this book will help you to get that!"
4,Great cookbook!,"This cookbook is great - it has quite a bit of information about doing many things with food, as well as recipes. This is not a book for beginners, however. It is definitely for people who are experienced, and enjoy fine dining. Totally recommend it..."
5,Indispensable,"Larousee gastronomique is indispensable for anyone who cares about food: it is an encyclopedia of recipes, techniques and facts without which your cooking and eating will be poorer."
4,"More bulk, less beauty than the 1988 edition","I've owned the 1988 edition of this masterpiece for several years. As a combination go-to resource, inspiration, and backgrounder on all things culinary, it is unsurpassed. The typeface, layout, and abundance of perfectly placed color photographs and illustrations make it a warm volume, despite its weight.However, I recently purchased this new edition as a gift. The recipient is happy, but I'm a bit disapointed. Though the new scheme makes distinguishing recipies a snap (red titles), the typeface is steril and the number and interest of photographs has declined substantially, largely consisting of full-page stock photo stuff.Nevertheless, a great book, but one that has lost some of its beauty. I'm happy to own the 1988 edition!"
3,Not as good as the 1988 edition,After comparing this newest edition to my 1988 edition I sent it back. I think attention to detailed information and instruction has been compromised in order to encompass too much in general and to make it look more like a coffee table book.
5,"The ""Bible"" in any kitchen","This is the most imformative book you could own. If you must buy a book for reference this is it. Almost any question you could ask can be answered. No kitchen should be without one. Very very in depth about everything from wine to choux. My chef has one in his office and I finally got one for myself to keep at home for reference and to LEARN. Some people think they know alot. Read this book and you will be EDUCATED in all things culinary. Great traditional french recipes, amd amazing pictures. A MUST"
2,Not Too Useful,"It seems like this is mostly a dictionary of dish titles with descriptions of what they consist of. It is neither an encyclopedic reference to ingredients, techniques, or styles nor a catalog of recipes. Much of the cuisine is impractical for the home, and most of the rest is too old fashioned for professionals that work in a competitive and trendy environment. I use Joy of Cooking extensively at home and was looking for more base knowledge like that found in the introduction to sections and the know your ingredients parts. Larousse is very encompassing but appears also to be very cursory. It makes a great source for obscure trivia."
1,Poor quality from outside vendor.,"This was the third one I ordered. The first was perfect, the second one never arrived, and I did not get a refund. The third had poor quality printing which was a very tiny font, and thin paper, dirty on edges, corners bent. Sent from India, took over a month to receive it. Will never order something this expensive from outside vendor. I would order directly from Amazon."
2,Nice fit - good protection but a few problems,"I thought I liked this case at first, then I realized (afte 6 months) it's just not worth the hassle. It's very difficult to open at times, and the hinge is very weak. I also don't think the covered screen is worth the protection. On must open the case to see who's calling them, and that's NOT a one-hand operation with this case."
1,crappy,"video quality for its price is crappy, animation is not great. in times of ice age, finding nemo etc. this animation is crappy with voice and video synchronization issues. Also, the product description says hindi, but its english.net-net: low quality animation, over priced for its worth. not recommended"
2,Bad,"Bad Build Quality. I used one of the wrenches on a rusty bike pedal, not only I couldn't open the pedal (well not specifically the wrench's problem, maybe it was too rusted) but it broke! some of them are quite thin."
1,Poor Quality,"I needed a set of tools and wasn't expecting much. I just needed to do a few simple things around the house and this seemed like a good set for that and I could purchase higher quality tools when needed. The tools are all really flimsy, but the worst part was that the hammer head just came right off when I was using it. I would recommend looking elsewhere."
1,Junk,This item is terrible. The quality is so bad that Amazon should be ashamed for selling it. Cheap tools. They basically are not useable. I have never left a negative review but this item is just so bad.
3,Lukewarm,"The tools are decent enough. I like the screwdriver combo. However, the case is unsatisfactory. Tools keep coming out of their placeholders. I'd look for something a little more solid but don't know how you would tell ahead of time."
4,Tool Kit,This tool kit is a very good overall assortment of tools for small around the house jobs. The only tool not included is a pair of regular pliers.
1,not even worth the low price,"I just received this set and am returning it immediately. For the price I wasn't expecting very high quality tools, but I thought that coming from Amazon there would be a minimum standard -- not the case. The quality of all of the pieces is very low, the metal has been very crudely cut, the grips are thin and poorly placed on, the exacto knife and tape measure are flimsy, and the adjustable wrench that I received doesn't work at all (the cogs on the handle and on the movable piece don't meet up)."
3,Utilitarian,"160 piece is a hype. 160 pieces include 2 dozen nails and sundry. The pieces feel flimsy (Sure enough...made in china) but are just about functional. The hammer works great, though. Good for spot repairs, but you don't want to take your bike apart with this."
1,Rusty at delivery,"Yes, rusty at delivery. I don't mind buying something cheap and receiving something really cheap. No complain, you get what you paid for. However,receiving brand new tools, celled in box, and having the surprise to see they'are already rusty, that's... too much for me."
2,Poor quality on some of the pieces,This is not a good value as some of the pieces were real junk and could not be used.
1,"Cheaply Made, Promptly Returned","This set of tools are very cheaply made.For example, the wrenches' edges were not flat & straight, which made loosening or tightening bolts very difficult, if not strip them completely.Also, don't be fooled by ""160 pieces"" claim, 104 of them are small nails, screws and picture hanging fasteners.I would not recommend this tool set at all. Matter of fact, I have already returned mine to Amazon.com for full refund."
2,Too long mnemonic usage,I don't think this way of usage of mnemonics will be helpful a lot. Some easy words are hard to memorize using too complex mnemonics.
3,NO Table of CONTENTS??????????????,"This is a great book. But the navigation part ruins the whole experience.Dear publisher, Please add TABLE OF CONTENT."
4,My Vocabulary,"It really helps on my Vocabulary, i appreciate this book, it would be more better if this book contain easy example using original wordBuild Your Vocabulary Skills! A Quick and Easy Method"
4,Not bad,"The quality is much better than I could find on torrent websites and such. It's obviously not an official print of the film, but considering the rarity of the film it will have to do. If you are searching for a NTSC DVD of the film, this is the one you want to pick up."
2,color is not what it says it is,It says Ivory - but I actually have yellowish not ivory or shade of being an ivory
5,Perfect!,These were perfect for my stairs. The didn't stick on their own so I bought some doublesided tape and they don't move an inch. Definitely am going to buy another set.
1,Exploitive and Misleading,"Don't go slumming in this woman's autobiography and her accidental encounter with John Denver and a one night stand. It certainly isn't a balanced perspective of anyone. All of us have challenges and if you are a fan of John Denver, you are aware of his. Out of respect for his family, his children and Annie, it's not necessary to give voice to every indiscretion. Rather, let's realize that none of us look well under a microscope and focus on the good his work is accomplishing and the joy and insight his music brought us all. ""Take Me Home,""John's own autobiography, is a good place to start. If I could rate this woman's book any lower I would."
1,This book is pure garbage.,"This is a ridiculous book where the author recounts how she became an airline stewardess, met lots of celebrities, and had a one night stand with John Denver. Anyone who respects John, as she claims to, would never had written such a thing. I am sure it would not have been written if he were still alive. I am sure he would not be happy to know that this is out there available for anyone to read. It would have been better left unsaid. A one night stand with a celebrity is not love. It comes off sounding like something written by some giddy school girl, not by a grown woman at least in her 40's. This is a warning to any true John Denver fan. Do not buy this book. Donate the money to some worthy cause instead."
1,John Denver and Me,"This book was apsolute trash. Don't buy it. It's hardly about John Denver. It's mostly about ""ME""."
1,"I' m still waiting for the ""John Denver"" part in the book--","John Denver fans, PLEASE, PLEASE, take the money you would have spent on this book and donate it to one of John's many foundations. This book is total exploitation at it's best with no regard to John's fans or family. Outside of the brief encounters she had (?) with John, the rest of the book is about herself and John Denver facts that can be easily obtained in any bibliography. Absolutely disrespectful. If you had negative stars, I'd go all the way to the bottom...."
2,Please don't buy this book.. its not worth it!,"Before I purchased this book, I read some of the other reviews, however I just did not believe that the book could possibly be as bad as all that so I had to see for myself.Well, i learned a lesson, this book is not bad it stinks and i mean more than a skunk.The woman who wrote it is named Jean St. Marie. It is obvious that she wanted to use John to try and give herself a career. To this day, i have never heard of this woman and I probably never will. Most of the book is about St. Marie herself. There is only around one chapter that focuses on John at all.If it were me, and i had ""relations"" with a star I would be quite embarrased and I certainly would not want the world to know about it.So, if you want to read about a flight attendent who worked on airlines back in the 1970's this book is for you!but, if you want to read about John Denver... This is not for you!!"
5,"Entertaining, Respectful and Fun","After I saw John Denver perform live in 1970, I became a huge fan. He had enormous talent and charisma. ""John Denver and Me"" captures all of it. It's a well written book that COULD have been a trashy ""tell all"" but clearly this author had enormous respect for the man and his talent and went to the trouble to painstakingly research his life. The story is every fan's dream with a metaphysical flair and wonderful insights. The author had the rare opportunity to know John when he was at the height of his career, and shares the events leading up to their spiritual encounter. I truly enjoyed the book. It's classy."
5,Excellent,"Sensational read. Great style. A great story about a real life fan who met Denver - and, ehem, even had more than one special night with him. Extensive background info on Denver and stuff you may not find online about him - and stuff you can."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"As a former editor of a newsletter for John Denver, his privacy and his personal life were given the utmost respect ... his professional career was the only thing focused on in those publications. If in fact what the author says is true, it should remain as her memory ... not for public consumption. It's a travesty to the memory of John Denver to see that the only motive to some people is how much money can I make ... hopefully with the complete text of the book online, no one will waste their money on this dribble."
1,john denver and me,"Absolutely, the worst piece of garbage I've ever read.A one night fling with John Denver, and she calls him tall, about 6'1'' Anybody who knows John Denver, knows he's not near it. To painful to write more."
1,John Denver and Me,"It was a terrible book,about some airline flight attendant, claiming to be an actress that had a one night stand with a famous celebrity John Denver. I would not recommend this book to any one , specialty a John Denver fan.A real piece of trash."
1,BORING & EGOTISTIC,"If you want to read ALL about a self-aborbed woman with a HUGE ego who just happened to warm Johns bed one night - then by all means read this ""vanity print"" piece of trash. She obviously cared nothing for John or she wouldn't have written what she did. John was a human being with faults - he was single & lonely, she was waiving it in his face...so he did what any red-blooded unattached male would do. She, on the other hand, was classless enough to write about the encounter. This woman deserves your scorn, NOT your money. DON'T REWARD HER EGO BY BUYING THIS TRASH ! ! !"
1,It Stinks!!!!!!,Why is Amazon selling this garbage? I wouldn't give it the least bit of consideration much less buy it!
5,Wonderful Insight into the private John Denver,"The author shares the private moments she had with John Denver and explains the positive impact that he had on her life. A treat for all John Denver fans who have wondered what it would be like to be alone with John. Also, for all the flight attendants who have played the ""what if my favorite celebrity walked on my plane and asked me for a date?"" game. Ms. St. Claire has an easy, interesting style of writing. She shares many of her personal experiences that will ring true to the members of the Baby Boomer generation. Also, her book includes links to great websites about JD."
4,A Fan's Perspective,"John Denver and Me is an interesting viewpoint from a ""fan's"" perspective on how this artist's music touched her life. The book is a recall on her own personal life adventures from her college days to starring in such series as One Life to Live. The story is interesting, and her events of meeting her ""idol"" was intriquing and heartwarming. She backs up her book with musical background of the artist and a short bio on the man.She does a bit of jumping around with dates throughout her chapters which makes the reading sometimes a bit hard to read, but otherwise it is an easy and simple read that is entertaining. With more editing, the author could make this a longer and more fullfilling novel, but for now, I was content with what I have read."
4,A reverent tale,"This book is a tribute to John Denver, not a dis-service to fans, as previously ""reviewed"" here. Everything great about John Denver is chronicled in this book. In fact, it goes overboard at times as it extolls how extraordinary the man was. Great background details on JD's life and music."
1,The life and accomplishments of Jeannie St. Marie,"Jeannie St. Marie worked hard to accomplish many of her goals. This book is about her lifetime experiences. She explains in detail many of them. One of the dreams she had was to meet her favorite singer, John Denver. Much to her surprise she met him on a flight that she attended to. She tell us about the few days that she spent with him."
4,"Say, Who Do You Love?","A while back when Bo Diddley died I mentioned in a review of his work that many latter musicians, particularly white musicians were influenced by his songs, and covered them like crazy. That is the case with George Thorogood, with or without his Destroyers. Although he is probably best known for his bad boy anthem, ""Bad To The Bone"" Thorogood cut his teeth on doing covers of Bo, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and the other greats of the blues and early rock and roll. That is how we should measure his work, as an exponent of a certain kind or of rock and R&B. This album delivers some of that although his best work is in other albums. The stick outs here are: ""Nine Lives,"" and ""Rockin' The Walk""."
3,"Classic George, but is George Classic","Yes of course he is, this album brings out the best of George, the mixing on this album was equal to hearing these tracts as if they were being released for the first time.I recently seen GT&D at a MusicFest in Northern Minnesota, the whole gang was awesome. George put on a show as always. He really did about every song listed on the Anthology Album, it was awesome.George, keep on Rockin til you die, if someones gotta die for Rock 'n Roll, might as well be you!"
1,Your Town (Big or Small) has a better Bar Band....,"....it amazes me that Thorogood gets on the radio at all....why are you people here considering buying 'his' music....buy the original recordings by the original artists. KFOX in San Jose, CA is a classic rock station, and on Tuesdays it's - Two for Tuesdays, and throughout the weekend it's ""Triple Shot of:(artist/group)"" ....I can't get to my volumn control fast enough when they play one of 'his' songs, let alone 2 or 3. Worst music ever....and they only play, ""Bad to the Bone; One Burbon, One Something, One Beer; Who Do You Love; and Move It On Over""....what a 2nd rate collection of OTHERS PEOPLES SONGS.....don't waste your money. And you don't want to know what I think about Janis Joplin and Santana?"
2,gps,I bought this for geo-caching. I actually decided to go Lowrance because I have another that I use for the car and liked that one. I hate this iFinder GPS. It is so hard to use and the directions are completely confusing.I did look into Tom Tom and theirs can used for driving directions as well as for entering the latitudes and longitudes...
4,useful and economical,Not bad for the price. This unit works as advertised and is a very useful tool. The main drawback for me is the size of the display but that would be the same for any hand held model. It would also be nice if the 12 volt power cord was included instead of having to be purchased separately.
5,Really Great Selection of 10 Jazzy Numbers !!,"Randy Villars excellence shines through on his new CD. The numbers selected provide the listener with a sound you'll never get enough of. The smooooth, toe tapping jazz is a treat for any occasion- just relaxing, working, or what suits your fancy. The fantastic sound of Randy's sax, along with expert guitar, keyboards, bass, drums and percussion offers many hours of pleasure, no matter what style of music you enjoy. Give yourself a treat. Try it. You'll like it !!"
3,Only nice...,"There aren't words to describe the 5 songs I love...they're just that great! However, the remaining CD is boring. I was very disappointed not having a full CD to enjoy."
1,It's a piece of junk!,I bought this for my son's 9th birthday. The light stopped working seconds after putting in the battery. The entire Magniscope literally fell apart within five minutes. Don't waste your money!
1,Travesty,"Someone gave this to my son for his birthday and he was excited while opening it. Then we realized the bulb was not working, which made the entire microscope unusable. I wrote to the company and a customer rep promised to mail us a bulb. That was 4 months ago. We are stilll waiting. Clearly they do not make good on their products. This one should have been taken off the market."
3,not realistic,"I got these cups simply because they matched the plates that I was using. The plates are beautiful, but i think the cups are ugly."
3,"Nice, but not as nice looking as the plates",The cups serve the purpose but they do not have the same elegance as the plates. The handles make the cups look cheap.
1,Review,"I've tried this product as directed and I did not noticed or experienced any difference, so I stoped using this product. I'm 29 years old and I don't have any problems in that department, but desided to try this anyway. No results. Sorry."
4,"Met, not exceeded, my expectations","I purchased these poles hoping to get the most out of my early morning power walk. I have 4 small children, and I get up before dawn to get in some exercise. I like the poles, but they do slow me down. I don't use them every day, I just can't go as fast. I can feel the difference in my abdomen and in the backs of my arms, though! They are super light and easy to store."
3,Hype or Hope?,"I am not yet convinced that this product provides any significant benefits over unassisted walking. There is a small degree of stress reduction when going uphill and having the arms participate more in the walking activity surely must be beneficial. It may just take longer to assess the overall benefits. I have only been using the poles for a month as I write this. I do believe that someone is making a whole pile of money on this item though, as the materials used in the poles cannot be worth more than $5-10."
4,Psychological Mystery,"ORLAC is a gem from the early days of German expressionist filmmaking, with the underrated Conrad Veidt playing a concert pianist who loses his hands in a train accident and has the hands of a murderer implanted in their place. But the story takes second place to the cinematography, with wonderful set-pieces such as the mansion of Orlac's father, the train wreck, and Orlac's piano room. Fans of NOSFERATU will definitely want to take a look here."
2,I've seen better Veidt silents,"Couldn't wait to watch ""The Hands of Orlac"" since I already new the gist of the story anyway and have seen many Veidt movies (both silent and talkies). However...after sitting thru the first 30 minuets (waiting for it to get better) I couldn't wait to turn it off. Maybe I shouldn't comment on this silent as I haven't really watched it in total. I have a vast silent movie collection but I don't know if I even want to give it shelf room. And the soundtrack!!! KINO! What were you thinking!!! It sounds like a 6 year old at his first violin lesson! After watching this with my wife and looking at each other from time to time and probably having the same agonizing look on my face as hers...we just couldn't take it any longer. If you want to see Conrad Veidt at his ""silent best"" watch ""The Man Who Laughs"" instead! And if you want to see the same story/plot in an early talkie, watch ""Mad Love"" with Peter Lorre. (P.S. I know where you can get a copy of ""Orlac"" CHEAP!)"
3,not the best cat trap,"I have had two cats who went inside and ate all the food without triggering the trap, because the panel where the cat was supposed to step on was pulled up so high when it was set that some cats that were more cautious avoided stepping on it when they ate. However, I was lucky enough to trapped two other feral cats, but at some places the wire were not welded smoothly so when they banged their heads and faces against the trap trying to get out they ended up hurting themselves; I had to clean the blood from the inside afterward, which was a pain. The only good thing about the trap was its two doors, which made it easier to care for the feral cats before and after the vet trip."
2,Ultimate is not the correct word for it,"Nicely bound with excellent photography of representative trucks, this book is nowhere near a ""complete"" compilation of pickup types or years of manufacture. Errors abound in both text and captions; many model-years are skipped completely. Not worth the money."
3,Ricky didn't turn my crank on this one,"Ricky Peterson is one of the great genius's in the ""get down, funk, jazz, tighten your stomach muscles"", music scene. I have never been disappointed. On a desert island give me Ricky, Flim and BB's Grusins NY/LA Dream Band and I'll be OK. However, this albus is a little sappy and musically uninspiring. But it is still worth having especially if you are trying to thaw out a girl friend or you have a $2000 stereo system.If in St. Paul don't miss Ricky's club the ""Artist Quarter""But, I have to admit this is one of those albums which I'll put away and pick it up a year or two from now and play it and say, ""wow what was I thinking""."
1,Music without feeling...,"Neither rock, nor blues, not contemporary jazz. This is a kind of sticky-sweet music that leaves no impression. The recording is neither aggressive nor clam. This is no feeling music.Quality of recording is good, but the music itself is not appealing."
5,Best Book for Dads,"It has humor and really great information. If your Guy won't read any other book, at the very least get him this one. I have bought it for 3 of my buddies, and they have all loved it.Cheers,Computer Dude."
5,So much fun,"Probably the only baby books that daddy will read with enjoyment. Written with humor, it gives valid advices for taking care of baby from 0 to 12 months. I recommend this book to all parents with a sense of humor (and believe me, you need one to survive the first months of parenthood)."
4,mom 2 b,I bought this book for my husband since he has never been around babies before. I wanted him to gain some knowledge of the whole process since we are expecting our first little on in the spring. This book is both packed with well needed information and a little bit of entertainment. It is not as dry as most books and offers a bit of humor in an otherwise stressful time. I even read of few chapters and it made me chuckle. I would definitely recommend this for new daddies to be.
4,gift,browsed through it and liked what i read about the advice to a new father.. who knows not much about birthing . Practical and down to earth explanations about real issues.
5,Be Prepared,This was a great book and resource for my husband. It was the only parenting book he would read.
5,better than a DVD for the dad with no time (or will) to read,"A family member sent this when my firstborn arrived, and I enjoyed the book's humor and valuable content so much I gifted it to my brother-in-law when his first child was born. Just like the healthy food for kids that tastes good (they'll never know they're eating healthy!), this book delivers a wealth of invaluable tips, timing of events, how-to's, Dont's and straight up information via humorous drawings and diagrams, wit, catchy phrases and laugh out loud style.I often read the book in bed at night and would share passage after passage with my wife - the new mom - who would chuckle along with me (quietly, so as not to wake the baby). To confirm it's your flavor of book, check out the sample above: ""What Your Baby Won't Look Like"" and the back cover's list of topics, including ""How to stay awake (or at least upright) at work."" Well worth it!"
5,Totally Recommend This Excellent Book,"Gary Greenberg and Jeannie Hayden have written a parenting book that is both highly informative and really funny. As a father-to-be (5 months and counting), ""Be Prepared"" has become my constant companion. Three words for anyone in need of solid parenting advice: Buy This Book."
5,A must for new dads,"This book is hysterical. Think Boy Scout handbook meets parenting advice. My husband would read this book and chuckle (see ""Evolution of the Boppy""). It's the only parenting book that he has read from cover to cover. The book has great, practical suggestions, but presents it in a fun, unassuming way. We've purchased a copy for all of our friends that are expecting their first child."
3,OK,Dad's to Be - it's a better read than sticking your head in the sand I suppose! Not a bad read - some cute tips in there but I tend to think a little time on Google you could find many of the same tips and experiences for free. I wouldn't not recommend it but I feel the need to learn a lot more after having finished this one.
5,New dads need this,A friend loaned this book to my daughter and son-in-law. It's simply written and very humorous. It answers a lot of questions for first-time dads and has a lot of great hints and insights. I referred to it the first time I gave my grandson a bath. I bought us a copy when we had to give the first copy back to its original owner.
5,my hubby loves it!,"When my husband and I found out we were pregnant I got this book for him. He really likes it and actually reads it!! It's written in ""guy language"" with funny comparisons and great ideas. It reminds me of a Maxim magazine for new dads. Enjoy!"
5,"Great advice, fantastic illustrations","I received this book as a gift, and it's my favorite ""how-to"" book for new dads. Not only is the advice rock solid, but the drawings are wonderfully funny. (I especially enjoyed the good-bye salute to the breasts.) The only thing I would change is the section about the rectal themometers--the forehead scanners are the new go-to for temp taking. Buy this book for yourself or a new dad in your life, you will be happy you did!"
5,funny and helpful!,"i was curious as to what all the chuckling was about, so i read it after my hubby was done. this book is great! there is very practical info, but it's so funny to read! it helped keep him hooked into reading the whole thing. i would reccomed highly for any new dad, dad to be"
4,"A great book, but getting dated","Some of the content is getting a bit old on this book, so it may not be perfect for a new gift to dads anymore, but it was a funny and quite helpful read. I enjoyed it!"
3,Worth the buy and here's why...,It's very funny. But it also carries serious messages and activities about what to expect with your new baby. It provides creative solutions to every day situations and and has plenty of safety information for the home.
2,Meh- not for me.,"I returned this book. Maybe it's just me, but I found the writing and artwork to be mediocre. The artwork is supposed to be a throw-back to 50's 60's book, but doesn't pull it off and ends up looking crappy. The writing is kinda jokey and the tips are worthless- (really!? I need to know how to make an impromptu diaper form duct tape and rags? maybe cause I'm not a dad, but whatever.) I would prefer more facts and real info."
5,"LOVE this, better than expected.","I was expecting a good book with some helpful, fun tips. My expectations were exceeded greatly. This book is perfect for any new Dad. My baby is due in Summer 2013 and I will read this several times over before he/she gets here. It is a fun book to read and is full of pictures, good for guys and is very funny while being helpful. I have recommended it to several new dads already. Buy it new dads!"
3,Good as a gag gift,"For a gag gift only. I agree with comment that said ""funny, but not helpful"". My husband hated it."
1,Bad attitude,"While this book contains some useful information, much of it is outdated. Further, I was saddened to see how self-absorbed and negative it was. Much of the book seems to indicate the author feels fatherhood is a life sentence of drudgery. Considerable mention is made of the death of one's former freedom-loving existence, and how a baby will inconvenience one's life. I purchased this book based on the number of glowing reviews and was disappointed with the book's negative additude toward fatherhood."
2,funny but not helpful,"Definitely funny. But not helpful at all. My husband got it as a gift. He read it initially just because it's his best friend that gave it to him, and had a few laughs but didn't help at all in the caring for the newborn. He relied more on the ones written by doctors and pediatricians."
2,"its funny, but just ok","based on the reviews that I read, I thought that this would be a great book for my husband since we are expecting our first baby. In reality, it offers some practical information that everyone's book seems to have, only put into a more humerus light. My husband enjoyed the first read, but I doubt he will pick it up again, so not sure how much longevity it will have."
2,not sure what i was expecting,"I bought this book based on reviews, but I am not quite sure why it had such good reviews. The book is OK, but really kinda lame. Honestly, the graphics make the book look like it was made in 1940 and some of them are down-right weird. There are a few good, humorous points in the book. I have not finished it. Not sure I would recommend. Hopefully I'll pick it up again and it'll turn out to be a great book."
2,Average at best,"I received four fatherhood books over the holidays and this was one of them. The illustrations are mildly humorous, but the content fell short. Not really a bad book, but definitely not great. If you want funny, there are better choices."
2,must have,my son-in-law is loving this book.... as a result so is my daughter! Great practical and thoughtful ways to understand the emotional and physical changes of becoming a dad and family
1,Offensive and sometimes inaccurate,"The authors seem to attempt a boy scout type of handbook for dads. Their attempts at humor are lame and offensive. Some of the information is inaccurate or inappropriate. Some of the advice is flat out bizzare. It seems to have been written by a guy with a 1950s mindset - outdated. It's not all bad, but enough of it is, that I would not recommend it to any Dad."
5,Great Book,"If you're looking for a simple how-to, with very little frills, this is your ""new dad"" book. It's got amusing pictures throughout for entertainment value, and the information is concise and accurate on most fronts.If you're looking for a scholarly work, you'd do best to look elsewhere. For those who want a quick low-down on any number of parenting issues, this book fits the bill quite nicely."
4,Humorous and helpful,"Quick read. I laughed some, which was nice. And it is broken down into very short chapters, which makes it great for reference. I expect I'll open this book back up as the child grows in age to refresh myself on some of the helpful tips."
5,Great book for new parents,"I am writing this review for my husband, who absolutely loved this book. He said that the easy-read and humorous nature of the book combined with the actual hints and instructions for how to deal with both me, and our new baby was great. He loved to read this book, he'd laugh and read me parts of it as well. I think if you're looking for a book for men to read about new babies, this is it!He likes it because it covers not only what to expect from the birth itself (what the baby will look like, act like, etc) but the different phases as they get older. How to deal with feedings, sickness, sleep patterns, etc."
5,By far the best beginner's SPSS reference,"If you are as clueless about SPSS as I am, you must buy this book. It has clear, concise instructions in language a layman can understand. If you want a more advanced manual because you already know the basics, you may want to look elsewhere (Tabachnik & Fidel's book would be the next step up from this one). This would be a great textbook for a Statistics course at either the undergrad or graduate levels. It also explains each type of statistic clearly with great examples. It covers t tests, ANOVAs, regression, and much more. It was great for me to be able to review the statistic I was going to use to ensure that I understood it."
3,Pictures are good,This is not a book a botantist would buy but if you are a hiker or visitor to Arches it is an excellent way to introduce yourself to some of the plants you will see. It tells you a little about how the Native Americans used the plants and some ecological information. The photographs are excellent and worth the price of the book
3,"A decent film, but not very memorable","Chain of Fools, brings to the screen the story of a barber who finds himself involved in the theft of rare Chinese coins.Overall, the acting is very good (Jeff Goldblum, Steve Zahn, Salma Hayek and the rest of the cast do a good job), but it's Tom Wilkinson that really steals the show for me.As for the plot, it is interesting, though it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it."
2,Walking thru molasses,"It's really,REALLY unusual for me to rate anything below 3 stars & I was looking forward to watching this on the basis of the other reviews. But I bailed after 30 min. After a couple of weeks I thought to myself ""It can't have been that bad, can it?"" & sat down with it again, starting where I left off. I managed another 20 mins & gave up. I am a fan of several members of the supporting cast & can't fault their performances. I thought the script was pretty decent & the oddball collection of characters interesting, if mostly stupid &/or unlikeable. But the pacing was absolutely dreadful. Maybe I'm spoiled by heist films like ""Snatch"", but in between brief bouts of slapstick violence the main character seemed to move in slow motion. I found I just couldn't be bothered to care about what happened to him to the extent of wasting my time watching the rest of the film!"
3,Silly comedy with all star cast,This movie is the basic looser makes good comedy.It is very unlikely that a barber would have both Lara Flynn Boyle and Salma Hayek as wife and girl friendlet alone have three coins worth several millions of dollars?So on this unrealistic plot twistthe movie pretty much fails with an all star castwho mostly went on to bigger and better things?It might of worked with Jeff Goldblum as the barber?
5,awesome,"these are awesome for writing on darker materials or for more contrast, where needed. The ink is more permanent than other metallic markers (i use them on arrow fletchings and the only way it comes off is if plastic beneath it does."
1,Dried Out Markers,"The markers were dry. I tried all four markers. I just continued to use the one I already had, which fortunately has not run out. I was able to complete my project."
5,Smooth Writer,"These markers don't need to be shaken up and don't need time for the paint to soak into the point. Out of the box it makes a nice sharp line with even flow. It can be used to write on white, black, and translucent objects."
4,Sort of metallic,"Very good quality. I expected the mark to be just a little more ""metallic"" than it is but, am still pleased."
5,Great for marking dark color items,Sharpie has a great product here. It stands out on dark color items and even works to mark clothes (kids stuff for camp). Lasts a long time if you keep the cap on. Highly recommended.
4,ROSWELL last capter,"We see a lot of sacrifices in this the last season. Katherine Heigl takes center stage, without taking our eyes from our fav Alien/Human couple!"
2,Season 3 dissapoints,"After watching the first 2 seasons, i was expecting much more action and a more detailed ending. The point where Liz starts getting alien powers is absolutely ridiculous. All i can say is they were desperate to end this story because they had no ideas on how to carry it."
4,3rd Season of Rosell is 2nd best of the series,1st season is the best; 3rd season is 2nd best. I loved seasons 1 and 3 but not 2.
1,missing Disc 3,"Got the box set and it is missing Disc 3 (has two copies of Disc 4).I sent Fox an email and now they want me to send them the complete box set. It looks like I have to pay for return postage.And I will probably get another faulty box set.Shame on FOX.Hello,We do not replace individual disc you would have to return the complete box set to us for replacement. Please make sure to include your full name, physical address, phone number and reason for return. Make note that our turn around time is of 4-6 weeks.Fox Consumer Attn: Erica20102 S Vermont AveTorrance CA 90502"
2,Blech,"I LOVE the Roswell series, but season 3 felt so out of place. You can sense that the big wigs wanted more brainless action scenes or something. There are major holes in the plot, and characters' illogical actions don't match up with their personalities. It was a frustrating experience watching it, especially up to the ending with no closure, but I was still entertained somewhat."
4,"REGARDNG NEW DVD SET OF SEASONS 1, 2, 3, OF ROSWELL",I like this series and this new packaging does not change a thing accept it cheaper. I paid 19.99 per set when it was first released compared to the original at thirty something dollars per set. Who cares what is on the outside of the box when everything else is the same. Great show I hope you enjoy it as much as me.
3,"OK, but not as good as first two seasons!","A must have if you are a fan, but the third season just does not stack up to the first two."
3,It's an ending at least,"While I'm a big fan of the series, I have to admit that after the first season, things started going down hill. In this 3rd and final season they do manage to come back to more of the human side of the alien's story, which is what interested me in the first place. I also appreciate having closure, with their wrap up of where everyone ends up, and that was probably the highlight of this season to me. So, take it for what it is- Fun, a little bit of silliness, and well, that might be about it."
5,EXCELLENT ENDING,The entire short season was excellent...acting and effects were as good as any on the major networks.
4,A good way to end a great show.,"The show in its third season continues to be great, there were some really good episodes towards the end. But the final episode wasn't great, the only positive thing about it: TESS was already dead!!!!! (If you watched the show you know why I hated her so much, jaja!)"
3,3rd Season- Different from the others,"I am not saying it is bad or good, just different. There is less Sci-Fi and more of a ""Dawson's Creek"" aspect than the first 2 seasons.The 3rd season jumps into a storyline so different from the season 2 cliffhanger. Liz and Max are criminals..Isabel is already dating a man for a couple months when her boyfriend has just died..Then it continues from that point on.I am not a sci-fi fan, but I do miss the excitement the first 2 seasons had with many episodes that left me on the edge of my seat. I didn't get that feeling from this season."
3,Season 3 not so hot,"I loved the roswell series, but truthfully by season 3 it got pretty pathetic. Seriously one drama after another, and it got way out there."
3,not good,"i was sad to see what a bad plot had been written for this season of Roswell. I was expecting some more alien drama, which i got. but the thing is that pretty much all the drama was about isabel. Her past life is all that they talk about. The first season provided to mystery to draw viewers in. The second season provided clues to fill in some blanks. Finally we get the last season and it seems they ran out of ideas. what do they do? pick the hot chick and conjure up a stories about her for the rest of the season.To the writer: Quit fussing about the past and give us something new!"
5,A good ending...,I hated seeing Roswell cancelled but at least they tied it up well and left a good taste in your mouth.
5,Well worth the money!,"I became addicted to Roswell the winter of 2003 when Sci-fi first started to air the show. Season 3 became my favorite season and like all of the other Roswell addicts out there we wish there was more. There is a major campaign going on right now, we are trying to convince TPTB to give us a Roswell movie to complete their story. As a staff member of RoswellMovie.net I'd like to invite all of the Roswell fans to join us at http://roswellmovie.net and help us bring Roswell back to life, if even for only one last visit!"
4,great product,seller did a great job getting item here even though it took a little longer thatn expexted. really enjoyed the show. Thanks
5,fantastic!!!,"My daughter and i are currently watching the first disc and are thoroughly enjoying the adventure of Max, Liz, Isobel,Michael and Maria... we are experiencing the more adult side to the characters as they embark on more adult related adventures, away from high school. Isobel's romance and impending marriage, which of course is followed by her wedding day there after. Shows a more human side to Isobel as she struggles with her alien side and a commitment to her human husband. Max and Liz unite as a team which utimately ends in trouble with both parties of parents. Thoroughly enjoyable and looking forward to the other five discs.My daughter and i thoroughly enjoyed seasons one and two so.. three will be no different judging by the current episodes we are viewing.If you love science fiction, romance, adventure and entrigue this is it!!!"
4,Awesome ending,I thought this was a good way to end the show especially on short notice. A lot of things did evolve so fast but was nice to see a different change in the show and the problems that arose for the characters. Too bad the show had to end. Really enjoyable and look foward to seeing the stars of Roswell in other shows. Hopefully they will have better luck in the lasting of their shows than this one.
3,LOVE THE COLOR!,"I love the color of these shoes and the perforations add an extra bit of detail. They are very comfortable, however, I bought these in size 6 since that was the smallest size they had and I am really a 5 1/2 and unfortunately for me these shoes do run true to size and they are big on me. I managed to add some inserts so that they would fit, but I really would prefer to have a 5 1/2."
2,Too narrow,"The shoe was too long and narrow for my foot. However, it was well designed. I had to send these back."
2,This was the wrong one to start with.,"I started and stopped the Renshai series with this novel. Too many references to characters I didn't know,and to characters I thought I did know from Norse mythology, but didn't expect to act the way they did in this novel. Maybe I've been brainwashed by the Wagnerian version of 'Twilight of the Gods', but I was expecting something a bit nobler and more awesome than showed up in 'Beyond Ragnarok'. The elves seemed to be particularly clueless."
4,!!!!!!,"This book was great! But i was a little disapointed when Mitrian of Mar Lon (or the ""old"" characters) weren't in this book. But i realize it's necessary. It bothers me that they didn't tell about what happened to them in this book. I like the new charecters though. And the elves are funny! But another thing that REALLY annoyed me was that Reichert repeats herself over and over again. Like how every time Baltriane passes the paintings on the walls she always mentions that he takes no notice of the beautiful paintings or that it ceases to amaze him."
3,not mickeys usuall quality,"the begining of the book is very confusing and it dosent seem to ""connect""with the last trilogy but over all it is a good book and i'm glad i read it. i hope micky keeps cranking em out!!!!"
4,Good but not as good as first trilogy,"Is the author not a woman? I'm male, and not one of these picky feminists, but give Mickey her dues, she is female. The book itself is OK, I;m looking forward to the next one to see if it reaches the same quality of character and plot as the original three."
3,Peters out,"Starting strong, *Beyond Ragnarok* holds great promise at the beginning, the seeds of an epic tale sown in the excitement and terror in the prologue. However, the work continues on to become a sloppy mess, brightened only by the powerful images of the characters and the cool concept of Law vs. Chaos. The pace is definitely too slow, and the language has a flowery, showy feel, as if Reichert is trying to impress her readers. Well, it doesn't work, because the formality of the words adds to the tedium of the plot, which splits off in a dozen directions and meanders away to pointless storytelling."
2,i regreted starting,I found myself reading this book and wondering what is going on. I think Mickey hardley scratched the surface of the characters personalities and it seemed like they were just going through the movements.
1,Really bad video quality,"Another reviewer has also said it, the video quality is truly bad, and makes the DVD nearly unwatchable. If you have not seen the film before, you will miss a great deal simply because of the poor video, the story will be very hard to follow."
5,Well done,"The movie was delivered in a timely manner, and was exactly what I expected. I look forward to dealing with you in the future. Thank You!"
4,Well written practical book on IT strategy,"I was looking for a comprehensive book on IT strategy. As a CIO and a consultant I have performed strategy development engagements. But I wanted to make sure I was indeed covering all the right areas. This book contains a number of examples, sample questions and surveys which are very helpful in conducting a strategy engagement. Although, some are too detailed for an experienced person, they are still useful from completeness point of view.I would have liked some of these to be available in an electronic form to be able to be customized.I recommend this book to strategy novices as well as practitioners."
4,Easy Reading,"I have not worked completely through this book, but have found it to be very readible with sound information. Everything does not apply to my situation (very small organization), but the concepts are clear."
3,decent guide,This is a fairly decent compendium and useful .. just a bit dated and lacking in real depth in some areas
3,Interesting but ...,"Finding the style the book is written a bit hard to engage. The methodology is great, but it bogs down at times comapared to others. Some of my favourite titles of late have been from Harvard Business School and these seem easier to digest in quick spurts (time to read is limited). Otherwise a very detailed process with sound princples"
1,Disappointed in the dark.,"I own more Gerber tools, knives, and flashlights than all the other brands in my collection. This is the first time I have been disappointed by any of their products. After two weeks, I now have the good fortune to have a knurled key ring with an attached Gerber Flashlight Cap!"
3,looking for replacement,"I'm ready for the third one (over 10ish years) and I'm having trouble finding another. One of my cats plays with this each morning. The door part is in great condition, but the bird will be off soon. I would love to be able to just replace the bird and have thought about tying something else on the bottom of the bungee string. I may have to try the one that hangs on the door. Does anyone have any suggestions?"
2,Great Toy that Breaks Fast,"My two kittens loved this toy, and played with it constantly for about two weeks. Then the plastic piece that attaches to the door connector snapped. No way to repair it, sadly. If only someone would make a cat bungee with some staying power!"
4,Awesome toy!,"One of my cats ignores this toy, the other plays with it all the time - especially when we're trying to sleep. Grr.Very easy to install, and if your cats like this type of toy - they will love it. I've had to replace the mouse a couple of time (not because they're poorly made, but because my cats have sharp teeth and strong jaws).A great source of entertaining for cats and people alike."
2,Lacks real emotion and heart,"I expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability."
5,Abraham,"Well acted and well produced movie. Richard Harris was the perfect choice for the ageing Abraham.Chosen Ones (Aedyn Chronicles, The)One Night with the King"
5,The Bible Comes to Life,"The DVD Abraham and other stories in ""The Bible Collection"" are wonderfully done and are scriptually based. The movie script was true to chapter and verses in the Bible that made it easy to follow along and compare one to the other. The selection of the actors for each role was very good as well that getting caught up in the story was inevitable. A nice family Bible study time; although the kids may become a ""little"" bored and antsy because it is long...but good!"
4,Enlightening presentation of a familiar Bible story.,"I enjoyed this presentation. I am familiar with the account in the Bible and this was a good visualization of it. Some things were left out, and some things were poetically enhanced, but overall it was accurate and well acted."
4,Enjoyed Abraham,I have seen this movie many times and wanted to have a copy in my personal library so that I may watch it whenever I'd like. It is a very good movie.
4,Good movie,I enjoyed this movie. I especially enjoyed their take on Abraham's relationship with Isaac. And the scene of his willingness to sacrifice Isaac.
5,great movie,"i cant say enough about this movie and all that are alike,this is the special time of yr to remember the bible days"
3,Good Film,"For those viewers who are mainly seeking entertainment, I can see where this film would appear a little dragged out. The entire series of the Bible Collection has Biblical issues, but this film is more accurate then most. I was caught off guard when the film suggested that as a mature married man Abraham knew nothing our true God, and the next scene showed him telling the children the oral history of God from the beginning to his present time. The movie does have a few things out of order, but it is a very well made movie, considering it came out of Hollywood. I would, and have shown this movie to all of my 11 grandchildren, regardless of age. I believe it is important to tell your children everything about our lord, so they will not relate him to secular, fun loving characters they are bombarded with, like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny."
4,Finally the Bible gets good treatment on the secular screen.,"Since John Huston's ""The Bible"" no one in the secular movie world really attempted to film this magnificent story from the greatest bestseller of all times, and this movie does a masterful job of it, much better than its predecessor. It was interesting to note that there were scenes cut from the American version that were shown in the European version and vice versa. Aside from that, this makes an excellent Bible Study tool, as, poetic license aside, you see visually what you have read so often and learn to think over your biblical text more. The key is to remember that this movie isn't authoritative, but the Bible is. Enjoy!"
1,Blah,"This is not that great and over time it stinks. Does not have staying power. Hurry up and use it. Many colognes you buy can last for years, not this."
4,"Still-relevant, thoughtful book and arms control","Physicist Freeman Dyson's first job was working as a staff scientist for a RAF strategic bombing wing during WWII. What he learned there, his experiences studying under Manhattan Project scientists at Cornell, and work on arms control treaties in the early 60s, informs this thoughtful, humble and painstaking examination of arms control and cold war diplomacy.While not as urgent a read as it might have been ten years ago, Weapons and Hope is still worth reading. We still live in a world with nuclear weapons, and Dyson's thoughts on anti-missile defenses are quite relevant.--Stefan Jones"
3,"Nice toy, not super durable","The screen is nice on this, erases well. But the magnets fell apart. Other than the magnets, this has held up nicely to three children."
1,Surprisingly disappointing! Doesn't retain heat!,"I ordered this thermos because I liked the size and the fun, pink color and style. I also thought a specific Thermos company would have thebest quality product. It is a little heavier than most thermos this size, but I thought it would be better.However, when I add my morning coffee to it, the coffee is cold by the time I open the thermos just about 2 hours later.I tried heating the thermos first by adding hot water to warm it beforethe coffee. It will retain heat a little longer, but it quickly cools even when firmly sealed.My last, grocery-store, on-sale thermos was much better(and less expensive)and would retain the heat throughout the day, but it's too big to cart around. What went wrong with this product?A real disappointment!"
2,Early Arab and Israelites Relations,"(From another review): ""The Relations Between Arabs and Israelites Prior to the Rise of Islam."" By D. S. Margoliouth. Published by the British Academy, first edition 1921. Book consists of the three scholarly lectures which the author delivered at the British Academy. The lectures (and chapters in the book) are: The Pre-Biblical Period, The Biblical Period, The Early Christian Centuries. Hardcover book measures 6 1/2 x 10 inches and is 86 pages. Detailed scholarly text on cultural, political, and social influence / interactions and relations based on oral, written, scriptural, linguistic and archeological evidence of Arabs and Jews. A scarce and important antique vintage text for the Judaic or Islamic scholar."
5,Toast like it should be,"We had become quite disenchanted with bread toasted on one side only so I investigated to find a reliable replacement toaster. The Kitchenaid KMTT20008 was highly rated. Owning another Kitchenaid product that we are very happy with supported our choice for purchase. We have not been disappointed. The performance is what we asked for, even browning of any bread every time, both sides. My wife finds it excellent for her bagels. I highly reccomend this toaster."
4,Toasterama,"We have gone through numerous toasters over the years. I keep looking for one that doesn't take a week to make a piece of toast and actually browns it on BOTH sides. This Kitchen Aid is a keeper. It's simple, yet sturdy. My only complaint is it doesn't come with a lift for the hot toast. Burns the ole fingers. But will keep it for now."
4,Good Toaster,I looked at a few toasters before settling on this one to replace our old one that died. The toaster functions the way you want and the feature that allows toasting on one side of the bread is nice. The size of the toaster seems a little big but this does not bother me since we have ample countertop space. I like the appearance of the toaster and it's relatively easy to clean.
3,Toaster doesn't...not well anyway,Kitchenaid sometimes isn't what we expect. This toaster (returned) had two fatal flaws in our opinion: it toasted quite unevenly and the slots were not long enough for larger bakery bread slices. We are on a never-ending quest for a toaster that does toast the entire slice evenly. This must be a challenge to designers; this one failed the challenge.
3,What's missing?,"The toaster works well enough, consistent with other reviews that influenced my purchase. Shortcomings? An ""ejection"" button, which on my old Cuisinart allowed me to pop my toast manually, and the ""lift high"" feature that raised small pieces of toast -- my husband liked this feature on the old Cuisinart. I like my toast very dry. On the Kitchen Aid, I toast twice, the setting dependent on the freshness (i.e., moisture) of the bread. With the Cuisinart ejection button feature, I conveniently popped the toast at will. My husband likes to toast last night's biscuits. On the Kitchen Aid, he has to 1) reach into the toaster or 2) use a fork, to extract the biscuit."
1,DISAPPOINTED!,"I ordered and received this item only to find it dented in multiple locations. The process to return was very efficient, but unfortunately the second item was also damaged. I communicated with Amazon.com and it was apparent that it was a manufacturer packaging or a handling problem. I chose not to reorder but to purchase in store so I can see what I am buying."
4,toaster review,"Is very sturdy and holds up well, although is a bit large and takes up a good bit of counter space for a toaster."
1,worst durability than $15..,"KitchenAid KMTT200OB 2-Slice Metal Toaster, Onyx Black and Stainless SteelExpensive, but only last for a while. The level does not stay down after several months. It is zero star."
4,Good product,"Bought this over 6 months ago, and it works great. The slots could be a little longer, sometimes the bread slices are being squeezed a bit. The only other issue I have, is that it does not have a release button, to make it a bit easier to stop the toasting process. Otherwise, very pleased."
2,It's a Toaster.,"As the title says, it's a toaster. Two stars because of the price and also because, as other unsatisfied reviewers describe, quality of the unit varies greatly. If yours doesn't toast well, return as soon as possible for refund or replacement. I have had mine for over a year.1. It looks nice.2. Easy to remove crumb tray.3. It has a bagel setting.4. Easy to cancel toasting.5. But does it toast? Yep. It toasts. But so does a $20 model.I thought I was purchasing the best toaster in the world- one that would make the best toast ever. However, I should have returned this product after finding that the unit I have does not toast evenly. Viewing through the toast holes one can see that the heating coils inside the unit do not become evenly bright- thus not toasting evenly. I suppose I expected more from the KitchenAid brand. Be skeptical."
4,KitchenAid Toaster,This toaster performs about average; i.e what is expected of a toaster. The settings have to occasionally get re-set to get the same degree of toast.
2,Lasted 2 years,"I liked the style of this toaster. There were problems with it toasting unevenly, andit was not hot enough. It frequently took two rounds to toast some breads.Furthermore, it lasted only two years.Advice:Buy another brand"
3,"A short , happy life...","I too bought my KitchenAid toaster a little over a year ago, and was thrilled by the performance..great toast, great bagels, and a warming feature which I liked. HOWEVER, this morning I was not able to make the lever stay down in the ""toasting"" position. I tried gently; I tried a bit more firmly; and finally I gave up and let my husband have a go at it....NOTHING. The thing is dead, and of course, it's out of warranty....grrrrr. I had such hopes for a long relationship, since I have a number of other KitchenAid products which are super.What happened?"
2,STUPID TOASTER,"It makes good toast (minimum requirement for a toaster), but we've just cracked another of the black plastic levers that you use to operate it. We replaced the first one; I've put tape on this one. Seems that if you buy this toaster, you'd better plan to spend as much money in replacement levers as you do on the toaster itself. We don't even make that much toast!"
5,A toaster that toasts!,"This is great at making toast - what a concept! The toaster is a bit larger than most two slice toasters, but it is a clean and handsome design. The controls are straightforward, effective, and intuitive, with a solid feel to them. The results are very consistent. The bagel setting lets you tap a button right after pressing down the bread lever and it reduces the power to the outer toasting elements and lights up an indicator lamp. The inside of the bagel, English muffin, or whatever is then toasted to perfection without scorching the outer crust."
4,Very nice toaster...,"This is a good-looking, easy to clean toaster that gets the job done. Nothing very fancy, but who needs fancy? I just want toast. It misses the five-star rating because even at the highest setting, it takes two cycles to completely toast my husband's thick english muffins. The slots do self-adjust to accomodate really thick breads, though, so that is a plus. The bagel and warming features are handy extras, and the crumb tray is easily removed and cleaned. Overall, I recommend this product."
1,Lasted 15 months,"For a toaster this expensive, one might think it would last a few years. NOT! While it was working, it worked very well. Just after the warranty expired, the lever that you press to make it toast decided it would no longer stay down. The toaster still works, but you have to now stand there and hold it the entire time you are toasting something.I am going back to a less-expensive Black & Decker model. This was not a good experience at all."
5,Great budget replacement keyboard,"I bought this keyboard six months ago to replace the original that came with my Dell desktop seven years ago, which had been finally beaten to death. The key feel is excellent. Moreover, I have had no problems with it. I find the mute button especially useful. Note that this keyboard has the old style multipin keyboard connector, not a USB connector. Assuming your computer has the appropriate socket, this arrangement frees up a USB port.I found it remaindered at the local Office Depot for $13.00, but it's still a bargain at $19.99.Not having had any experience with more expensive or specialty keyboards, I can't compare the Logitech Elite to any of them, but I'm happy with it."
5,Babytales...What a book!,I couldn't put it down. I read cover to cover in one sitting. and touched on every emotion that I am capable of. What an achievement.
5,One of the best pregnancy books on the market,This was a great book. I found it difficult to put down. Any parent or parent to be will love this book
5,A very uplifting book!,"I found this book to be very uplifting, as well asentertaining. I enjoyed the different stories and experiences. unlike most tech books, this book doesnt preach...It describes and portrays pregnancy as it really is. I applaud M.S. Woodson for getting it right."
5,Take a stroll down the road of pregnancy with Babytales...,"Babytales: A Pregnancy Companion is the kind of book that you cuddle up into a comfortable chair, pour yourself a glass of no caffiene tea. and escape into the words. This book was all the things I look for in a book...and it's not just for pregnant woman. Its for all woman. If you are pregnant then you must purchase this book. You'll really enjoy it."
1,A collosal disappointment,"I have been listening to David Arkenstone's music since ""Valley in the Clouds"" was released, and I have to say that the last couple of albums have shown a sharp downturn in the creativity and originality which once hallmarked David's music. ""Caravan of Light"" is the worst sort of ""new age"" music; the musical structure is trite and the borrowings from the musics of other cultures is, at best, pretentious. Gone is the sense of openness and wonder which characterised ""Valley in the Clouds"" and ""Another Star in the Sky"" and adventurousness of ""In the Wake of the Wind"" and ""Quest of the Dream Warrior.""There is one small, beautiful gem, however. Track 3, ""The Jade Mountain,"" is an understated and lovely performance. It gives one a glimpse of David's true creative depths, which are otherwise sublimated by the bland, generic offerings of ""Caravan of Light."" For an introduction to the REAL David Arkenstone, I recommend the other albums noted in this review."
2,Some helpful ideas,"This book had some helpful ideas, but is really for a beginning choir director, as it really deals with basic techniques. However, these techniques are sound and reliable."
5,Suspend Reality,"Okay, so the movie version of Kirkwood's cult classic has some problems (see reviews below). It's still a great good time. Just follow the old ""suspend reality"" rule and don't look for flaws. If you really loved the book and play, the movie's worth seeing. Enough said."
1,P.S. Your Movie Stinks!,"Just saw a pre-release copy of this last night. It was all the six of us who watched it could do to see the whole thing. Some problems:1. Jimmy's apartment is described as being in need of cleaning up and also called a dump. What you see on screen is an immaculate apartment that most would love to have. At least have your production designer read the script to see what the apartment is supposed to look like.2. Technical problems include shoddy blocking, continuity problems during cuts, crossing the imaginery 180 line, and amateurish camera work.3. Ok, the first two were picky things, but the biggest problem is this movie falls flat on it's face. Attempts at humor fail, characters are not believable, the story is not engaging.I never saw the stage production but my hunch is it MUST have been better than this movie. I suspect much was lost in the adaptation. This one is not even worth renting."
2,A marginal film version of a great book,"Jimmy Zoole is having a bad streak of luck. He's been robbed twice in the past three months, his best friend died, his girlfriend broke up with him on New Year's Eve, and his cat is dead. Things are about to change when the burglar breaks into his apartment again and gets caught by Jimmy.Steve Guttenberg's directing debut is a margianl film at best. The action takes place so fast that there doesn't seem to be enought time to get to know the characters. Shirley Knight does a good job as Jimmy's Aunt Claire, and Lombardo Boyar plays Eddie Tesoro, the burglar, very well. But, anyone who has read the book or viewed the play will be disappointed with some of the character and scene changes. The humor of the book is missing, as well.The DVD does contain an okay commentary, some behind-the-scenes footage and an alternate ending."
1,The Movie Sucks! Save yourself and READ THE BOOK!,"Steve Guttenberg is such a whiney mess in this movie. It has absolutely none of the charm of the original book. James Kirkwood would turn over in his grave if he knew what Guttenberg did to his play/book!The book is one of the funniest things ever written. The movie is painful to watch and destroys the book. If you must watch the movie, make sure that you read the book first! The movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities."
1,"Oy, What a Disappointment","It's been years since I read the book, but this film brought back none of the good feelings I remember from that experience. The usually charming Steve Guttenberg is annoying beyond belief. Sadly, his directing debut is even worse. Pacing is agonizingly slow, editing is all wrong. The apartment, which is described in the film's own dialogue as a dump, is gorgeous. The whole thing makes no sense. Only my fond memories of the book kept me watching to the end, hoping against hope it would get better. It never did. The best thing in the movie is A. J. Benza as the would-be rapist Carmine. During his two brief scenes the screen pulses with energy. You know you're in trouble when the best thing in the movie is the rapist."
3,Joe Nichols,"This is the new Joe Nichols. He started his revalation with the video ""if nobody belived in you"". It was a good video but a little chezzy. Joe is a very good singer and he is one of my favorates."
3,Good Wax but hard to take off.,"Pros:I used several polish products for my car. I have open air parking at my work so during summer months I noticed some of polishes attract dust when they get hot. This is great for that reason and keeps car shining for months.CONS:Don't even think about applying in sunlight.Hard to remove from the surface.If you think you can apply it at large area and remove it later. If you want to remove it by hand , Good luck with that. Use polisher if you want to use this polish or apply to small area .When it dries, turns to hard white deposit. Hard to remove from hard to reach area because when you spray , usually you can't control where it goes. So you will have to clean it after polishing or you will end up having white spots in deep areas which are very visible if you have dark color car."
5,spray wax,"Ive tried alot of diffent spray waxes and this one is the best I""ve come across so far. I use it on the front end of my SUV after just a few apps the bugs seem to come off alot easier with alot less effort. I have showed this wax to a couple of my freinds and they were impressed with this product."
2,Very Little Strain,"If you're looking for hot footage of Julie Strain, you are better off with ""Delta Delta Die""."
3,Not bad but not good,"This was an ok movie. Very didvided on it. I can find as much good as i can bad, but i feel it's worth a view"
5,The Essence of a Genius,I had to have this set.Gil Scott-Heron is a true Genius.His words are timeless the Music&arrangements he does with Brian Jackson are classic.all of his most important songs are here.WHITEY ON THE MOON puts alot of Problems past&present on the table.same goes for THE REVOLUTION WILL NOT BE TELEVISED.nothing in Rap or any form of music Today packs as much punch as this.a Must HAVE&Listen.
3,"Awesome stuff, but not complete","Cannot give this collection 5 stars because it lacks his two most important cuts: 'The Bottle' and ""Johannesburg.'I'm sure there are limitations because he changed labels. If you want the best of his earliest work, this is it. But you should know you have to get those other cuts too."
5,Before Michael Moore there was Gil Scott-Heron,"Before the ultra popular retoric of Michael Moore there was the lone black voice of Gil. Literaly every one of the socio-political issues that Moore tackles through his books and films on the subject of America have been covered by GSH on this collection and his back catalogue. Of course GSH could not have reached as large an audience as Mr. Moore but none the less Gil's flag was flown there first!....His revolution was not Televised! Word to Brian Jackson on the keys and arrangments, brother Ron Carter(the most recorded Bassist in music History 500 Sessions +)and the underatted Pretty Purdie on drums and the eloquent Hubert Laws on Flute/Ts.Get this first as an introduction and then try ""Winter in America"".FMCD"
5,memories,brings back memories felt like 1972 all over again forgot what all the buttons on the steering wheel were for
4,A Guide For Color Photographers,"Henry Horenstein, author of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY: A BASIC MANUAL, a book often used as a photography text book, has a similar book on color photography. COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY: A WORKING MANUAL offers the same excellent how-to information provide in the black and white counterpart. The book contains many of Horenstein's excellent photographs and offers information regarding filters and developing color prints. While it contains some information on color transparencies (slides), it is somewhat scant and may in the long run be more helpful for printmakers. At a time when digital photography is all the rage, this book is not obsolete since Horenstein's expertise will help ant photographer, no matter what the medium."
3,The joys of photograyphy,"I found the book to be very helpful undersanding color theory, how to shoot and make prints, and many other elements of photography of which I was previously unaware."
3,a very basic introduction,"this is an extremely introduction to color photography. If you have any experience with color photography, I don't recommend this book. Although I can't say much because I somehow managed to buy this book twice, funny how that works? You could learn from this book, but there's other books with more information and more helpful out there."
1,Runs small,"I ordered the large, I am a 10 and 5'7. Way too small. The front skirt bottom does not gather up as in photo either. Returning."
2,poorly edited and poorly paced indie thriller,in a sense since this was a straight to video production as far as visual wise it was surprisingly solid. But the intrigue ends there since the movie feels like it was left on the drawing board. The movie wallows in headachey camera edits and chrachters that are never draw out. The plot line feels familiar and rehashed. the shear confusion of the storyline and awkward charachters difuse any sort of interest in whats going on.The performaces are patciualrly poor by Chris Odonnell in faux cool mode and acting as hollow as ever. Jeremy Davies adds a slight bit of unabashed levity and understated acting though and Bill Pullman acts cracked out. But ultimately the experience is forgettable.
5,Action Packed,I bought this movie because Litefoot and Russell Means are in it. Their performances were exceptional. Lots of action and suspense.
3,O'Donnell and Davies are excellent,"great movie about an undercover cop who is being chased down by the mob because he has the guys bag of money. Chris O'Donnell and Jeremy Davies give forceful performances, a good story but brims to a hault somewhere in the middle and then picks up with its finale. other actors like Racheal Leigh Cook, Joe Polito and Litefoot(also a rapper) contribute supporting roles"
2,Some Worthwhile Character Performances,"The storyline was old and tired to me. I did like the fact that it was filmed in 29 Palms, which is close by to where I live. I liked that it used a take on the Indian Casinos, which are all the rage here. I like Jeremy Davis and he has a cool subtleness in the way he performs, very sensitive and creating a depth to his character. I liked O'Donnell who plays against his cast type and does a good job, he really looks the part. My favorite was Bill Pullman, that guy can really act tripped out. I think he acts really freaky in this film and I liked that. I wish he had more scenes. Rappaport who is also good is in the film. I like him, its seems like he can play a cop good in any film. The other characters were over the top and I couldn't get into them, except Cook who plays her character pretty straight. I loved the ending, that was funny. The rest of the film was too predictable and I got bored with it. Anyways, for me it was probably 2 stars.Lisa Nary"
3,Wilkes County Marriages Review,"Brent Holcomb is an accomplished genealogist in South Carolina, however he seems to be a little out of his element in Wilkes Co., North Carolina. Some of the names are badly mangled/misinterpreted. Arranged alphabetically by groom, there is not a cross listing by bride. Brides and bondsmen are included in the index, making a search for females cumbersome. A better source is the WPA abstract of marriage bonds, but lacking that, this is a good book to add to your collection, provided you are as creative with spelling last names as the author was."
4,I heard these guys in concert and they're amazing!!,"I haven't heard the entire CD yet, but if it is as good as they are in concert then it is a must buy."
1,Going Fast Forward causes skipping,"I expect that in a business world that values speed over most things, Richardson & Murray's book would strike a sympathetic chord. Nonetheless, beyond the existence of a popular belief that the quicker the better is how business should be run, I know of no research which would substantiate the claims to this effect. Are the stories that are provided by the authors sufficient to confirm their statements? I think not. Business is always looking for the next fad, something that will make all the difference in as short a time as possible. Management authors and practitioners who collude in this misguided search for the Holy Grail do more harm than good. Organizations are successful in the long term if they engage employees' hearts, not if they focus on things and logic. This engagement and involvement, the establishment of a democratic community, are not attainable in 100 days - maybe multiples of a 100 days."
4,simple Classic---BUT missing....,"...U.K. artist Dido, known for her hits: ""Stan wit EmInEm,"" ""Thany You,"" and ""Hunter"", wrote this ballad with Max Martin and I think Rami. This song has such little lyrics, but with such great meaning-- a Grammy nomination--worthy-of. But there is only one thing missing: she didn't write it. This song fit Britney perfectly, no one else could sing it, but her."
1,Very Bland and Self-Absorbed,"Britney could be the most self-absorbed woman (girl?) in pop right now. It's all about her desire to be independent, the pressures of her fame, and Justin this and Justin that. This mushy ballad is simply painful to listen to, despite a songwriting credit from Dido. Do you honestly believe Britney will want to even think of performing this song onstage twenty years from now? No doubt, she's released some half-decent singles, but this one falls flat on its face."
4,Christmas Gift,I would recommend this product to any older brother or male that likes robot chicken! I would also recommend it to college students who procrastinate to no end. Great show!
4,imaturity for fun and entertainment,the show is awesome for all of us that grew up starting in the late 70's through the 80's 90's and today. the writers keep creative with a lot of classic characters
4,funny...for true fans of show,very funny...if your a fan of this show then you will love this...the extra features are fun also
4,So Much Insight,"If you love (or are interested in) Manhattan, this well-researched and lovingly stated history of the island is a must-read. Hammill's conversational style combined with his insightful research make for a delightful read."
4,Still reading this,Pete Hammil has realy researched the history and geography of New York. Very intersting. I think I read some of this history in Forever.
3,A history lesson and memoir that don't quite mesh.,"Hamill's love for Downtown Manhattan is obvious. He speaks lovingly of ""a city of daily irritations, occasional horrors, hourly tests of will and even courage, and huge dollops of pure beauty. He fills the book with tales of Peter Stuyvesant and John Jacob Astor, CBGB's and Delmonico's, but in the midst of this history, personal reminiscences are tossed in carelessly and this technique creates a schism in the narrative. It breaks the natural flow of his writing, which when on target create wonderful pictures of the Downtown that was. It's almost as if Hamill couldn't decide whether he was writing; history or memoir. I'm sure with careful consideration of approach this could have worked, but here style seems to be an afterthought, surprising for a newspaperman. Worth reading for his portraits of Old New York, but skip over the words when Hamill injects himself into the mix."
4,More than just nostalgia,"My initial reaction to starting this book (it was a gift from a relative who misses living in Manhattan) was that it would be heavy in the nostalgia that my aunt felt. And it was initially. However, Hamill creates an amazing tale of the incredible, and often little known, people that made downtown the place that it is today. He weaves his own life into a brilliant story that is supplemented by the history of a city that is as rich as any others. I read 'Downtown' immediately following 'The Island at the Center of the World: A History of Dutch Colonial Manhattan' by Russell Shorto, and the two books helped to paint a beautiful picture of the greatest city in the world."
5,12 Again-The Best Book Ever!!!!!!!!,kid's reviewI love this book. It's manly about a mom turning back into a 12 yr. old again. It gets more and more hilarious the more you read it. I could never put that book down. I recommended to all of my friends and they even wrote their own reviews somewhere. They all gave it a 5. It is the best book for kids to read. I really recommend it. Watch you can't even put in down later.
5,Christina at Richview Middle School,This book is great its about a 40 year old women who magically turn 12 one night. Its about how she really wants to stay with her mom cause she died and how she diecides it would be better to go back to her family. Its funny hearing about a parent who turns to a kid cause at some point grown ups forget how it feels to be a kid and how she says shes going to be nicer to her kids and under stands again how it feels to be a kid. Also how she deals with being a kid again after so many years and patrick being very worryed.
3,We were operators and young.,"Every operator I mean the eighties generation, will realise that this book is a window to the past, where we started many years ago, how we built our own ranges, the tire house, close quarter rooms where we spent thousands of pistol and sub rounds,where we hesitated before shooting a target next to our closest buddy playing hostage, where our snipers rounds buzzed while we rappelled through windows, and the cool beers at the end of each tiring day after day hard work, a reference to keep in your library for new and experienced operators."
4,Photo lovers enjoy,"If digital doesn't cut it for you, and displaying actual photo prints is your thing, this is a fun frame to do it in. The frame itself is a little cheap feeling, but the photos are displayed beautifully and once framed and displayed you'd never notice the frame was anything other than a nice black offset to the pictures. The text is fun, without being too intrusive. I have it set against a cream colored wall and the photos float beautifully."
3,Dark September Rain Is Like A Mighty Flood: Overwhelming,"At 133 minutes, Dark September Rain is too overwhelming for most viewers. It would be much more acessible to the average viewer if it were divided into chapters by topic, so it could be savored and digested a little at a time. This approach worked well for Akira Kurosawa's ""Dreams"" and it could work here too. The writings and the performances are too though-provoking to be fully appreciated at a non-stop pace."
1,an anti-semetic text,"This sad book deosn't have any literary qualities whatsoever. This is pure Anti-semetic drivel full of ultra christian rhetoric from the extreme right. Marx was a philosopher and an idealist, this book doesnt examine him in anyway whatseoever it just descends into religious rants."
4,Good textbook for a Great Class,"I took a class called ""Reviewing the Arts"" and this was our textbook, heavily supplemented by actual reviews from major newspapers. The book covers art, theater, music and the like. It's very readable and I only noticed one error in the name of the Martha Graham dance company, and apparently it's an error that has been there through several editions.Overall, this would be a good read for a student or someone who is interested in writing reviews as a freelancer or for a hobby."
4,How can you go wrong?,"I'm pretty sure it's not an officially licensed body cap, it has different mass to the one that came with my T2i. However, I'm also pretty sure that it was less than two dollars and does the job just as well, so don't take that as a complaint."
5,Purchased as a replacement for my Rebel Xsi,I lost my canon's body cap on a trip and needed a replacement. This one is the same that originally came with the camera. Very strong and a must have to protect your camera.
5,Standard Body Cap,This is the standard body cap for Canon EOS 58mm cameras. Necessary to keep your camera clean and definitely worth having a few extra on hand incase one gets misplaced.
1,What cover?,"Ha, so poorly packed, it arrived with no lens. Too much trouble to deal with so I never reported it. Piss poor packing."
4,Solid Home WAP,"I've used the FWAG114 for about 2 years now, and it has performed solidly for me with XP and 95 clients, unlike the linksys WAP that it replaced. As with any wireless access point, some tuning is required to help ensure a clear signal in our increasingly congested wireless world. The FWAG114 provides an easy to use web interface for configuration, and the default settings will work well for many applications. I have a fairly large space to cover, and use 2 114's configured to allow roaming within the space.The 114 includes VPN tunnel support, which may be unnecessary for many home users."
1,Simply does not work,"I have owned Netgear FWAG114 for over one year and have had repeated problems with random drop outs of service. Like a previous reviewer, I have had to reset the AP at least once a day for it to resume to work. At first, I thought it was my cable service; however, when I switched to a different router, I have absolutely no problems. I have updated the AP with the most recent Firmwire and have purchased several to test them. Unfortunately, they are all lemons and the problem lies within the AP itself."
4,Owned since June 2004 and not one major problem or issue,"For me this has been a sound electronic device running constant for nearly four years now. Solid firewall capabilities, never a reboot other than firmware upgrades, and plenty of configuration options to enable/disable or jackup various features.No product will ever be perfect and in fairness I have to add my gripes about this one: wireless signal strength varies and at times drops off when I'm outside (router is in a basement) which pisses me off but generally has not problems inside home, management interface is bland and cluttered, a bit expensive but you get what you pay for.If I could give it 4 and a half stars, I would. It loses one star because connectivity outside and only 75-80 direct feet away should work without 50/50 chances. Again, the FWAG is in a basement so going up one flight and out the front door (or through the concrete and earth) is probably tough for such a little signal wave. Nonetheless, I've been very happy with it!"
4,excellent all round product,"I have only just started into this book, but find it an excellent and informative product, by following every instruction step by step and constant practice, you can easily achieve the next playing level you desire, a good layout and quality product"
2,Not worth the price,"I play in a 60s/70s cover band that also plays a few blues standards and am always looking for new ideas. This book feels like a bunch of 3x5 cards grouped into chapters, a confusing arrangement. Richards doesn't address many basic blues piano techniques and never discusses soloing. The last part of the book wanders into jazz territory. I would recommend the book to jazz students, but not blues or rock fans.The ""lessons"" are a piece of sheet music (played on the CD) followed by bulleted points on parts of the piece and assignments for working on the piece. Frequently, the key and corresponding scale are reviewed before the piece, which seemed silly to me.I got so frustrated by the irrational organzation, I finally just put on the CD and listened for any phrase or riff that caught my ear, and referred to the book to find out how it is played. The CD is only piano, no band."
2,The worst picture quality,"When I put the disc into the player I thought I was watching a series from the early 1930s based on the decrepid deteriorating film quality. How can a TV show from the 1950s be this bad of shape? But it is. Hence the price.What's really odd is that they throw in ONE of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock films into the mix...what's he got to do with any of this? Was it done to mislead buyers so Basil's face can appear on the cover instead of Ronald Howard's? Makes no sense, the set contains 39 of R. Howards Sherlock series, 3 movies from the 1930s and just one of Basil's.What I do like is that they imprinted the episode # and title on the discs so when you are looking for a certain episode you can quickly find it by reading the label on the disc. 39 episodes are split among 3 discs. The 4th disc contains the 4 movies."
3,Was disappointed but......,"I bought this DVD believing Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce would star in the majority of the movies. Nope, only one -- The Woman In Green. But I found Ronald Howard and Howard Marion-Crawford and those two as Holmes and Watson were terrific.Their episodes are on three discs and I hated to see them end. This duo were great. There were several episodes that were top notch. The last disc had four full length movies, all but Woman In Green were a waste of time and disc space. Three stars because I was disappointed that Rathbone and Bruce were not featured more than once."
2,Don't waste words...,"""With just slightly less vigor than that of the Moors when they took Spain, the chironomid-pupa fly fished deep on a floating line took western lakes.""This is just a sample of the hair-pulling sentences that the reader must endure. While I give the book two stars for providing some useful content and a few inspiring photos, the nuggets of information are buried too deep in the poorly written chapters, superfluous paragraphs, wide text columns and amateur drawings. I have just one question: Where's the editor? I doubt that I'll purchase another book by Frank Amato Publications. It's just too frustrating a read."

3,Railguy612,Its ok up close but if I had to do it over again I would buy a more powerful light. When you get up close you sometimes blind your subjects.
1,No Deal,Unfortunately I'm unable to tell you anything about this device only to say that it didn't fit on MY Sony Digital 8 camera. So I returned it.
5,Helps tremendously with video and digital pictures,The light works well with my Sony HDR-CX700V video camera. It has an auto feature that allows the light to come on automatically when it senses that the surrounding is dark. There's also a manual feature that allows the light to be turned on or off whenever needed.
2,Shame on Sony,Bought this because the Sony website said it fit my camcorder (HDR-CX260V). It DOES NOT. This light only works on camcorders that have a proprietary 'active interface' shoe. Had to return it. (Thks Amazon for making it easy to return.)Shame on Sony for several additional reasons besides not having the 'active interface' shoe on more models:1. For claiming that its camcorders can record in low light situations - they don't2. Not having a built in light on most of its camcorders - like many other manufacturers3. Not making available Nightshot (see-in-the-dark infrared) like it had on older modelsNow I have to carry my own flashlight to illuminate low light situations. Shame. Shame.
3,mini light,"Ok, maybe it's me but in the picture , this looked big. ( I didn't bother to check the dimensions when I bought it..my bad). So when I got it, I was surprised to see a baby light in the box. ( the actual light is a little over an inch!)It's good enough for me cause my sony camcorder does not have any light at all. This light is good for short distance lighting only. It does eat up battery life so be ready to buy an extra battery for your camcorder."
