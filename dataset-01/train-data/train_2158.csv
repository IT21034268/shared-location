5,Great headphones with ipod remote,"I've been using these headphones regularly for a year now... in the gym, on the train, and everywhere else in between. The sound quality isn't perfect but the solid, deep bass makes it all worth it. The ""ear plug"" design blocks as much outside noise as most noise-cancelling headphones on the market. Also, these headphones are very comfortable and I'm able to wear them for long periods of time. I've been using them with an ipod remote, and whereas the ipod remote is showing significant wear and tear, my headphones are still in the condition they were in when i bought them.My only complaint is that ""around-the-neck"" style cord can be a little distracting and if you use these headphones with the extension cord and without a clip-on remote, the weight of the cord will pull on the left earbud where the cord connects. I'm hoping to buy an ipod shuffle because i know that this headphone cord would be perfect for connecting to an mp3 player on the arm or around the neck."
1,Not well designed,"Noise cancelling only good feature. The shortened Left side cord and then silver ball that divides right side and left weights down the cord and makes it impossible for earphone to stay in your ear with any activity like working out. Length of regular cord far too short, extended cord is way to much."
3,Great acoustics - flawed design,"I got these headphones because ipodLounge rated them as better than Apple's in-the-box ipod headphones. They fit better/more comfortably in my ear, and the acoustics are pretty good for the price. But the wiring design is just plain stupid. The left wire is considerably shorter than the right wire. So it means that I can't place the ipod anywhere distant from the left ear. To solve that design issue, Sony provides an extension cord. What a hack.I'll keep the headphones, but I'll upgrade to a better product as soon as I can.Save your money and keep shopping."
4,Not bad,I like these headphones but they tend to fall out of my ears sometimes. I have to push them in very far into my ear but they still work themselves out. Sound is excellent.
2,"Great sound, but very fragile","I love the Sony quality sound, but I've gone through about 4 pairs of these headphones in a year and stopped buying them. The spot where the two cords come together to become one is the weak spot, and anywhere from a few weeks to a few months you start noticing one side getting lower and lower til you can't hear it anymore. I think Sony has it right in the sound quality, but they need to rethink the construction so they don't break so easily."
3,Good product,"The purchase was successful, there was no problem, headphones are perfect and sounds good, so I use it, if you want more fidelity you must purchase another model, but again are perfect for my use."
1,"Great sound, poor quality, not what I expected.","Let me state first off, I absolutely love these headphones! The sound is great and they are quite comfortable. These particular headphones however, are not just headphones. Somewhere in the description I missed that they came with a microphone and a 2.5mm jack (with a 3.5mm adapter). The problem is, this adapter is just a short extension and the weight of the adapter pulls the cord where I plug it into my computer. So, over the past few weeks, the wires have been pulled out and I no longer have sound in the left earbud, and will soon loose sound in the right as well. If you want these great headphones, look for the true Sony Fantopia headphones, not some junk set that was built to use with a mobile phone."
5,How does Sony get that kind of sound from such small things?,"I am amazed at the clarity and great bass of these little marvels. It would seem that [$] is expensive for such little headphones, but in this case, they are more than worth it. Fidelity and volume of the songs out of my ipod almost doubled compared to the ipod's original earphones. With the MDREX71SL, I can lower the volume on the ipod about 30% from what I was used to with the same volume as before, a higher clarity and an increased battery life.If you have an ipod, do yourself a favor and buy this earphones. I used to be in doubt but now I am definitely a believer now."
2,Very bad wire insolation...,"I would give 5 stars for that product till last month... Very comfortable, great sound quality etc... But last month the insolation of the wire started to come off... Firts only a little bit of wire was sticking out but not so long time after the insolation came off and there is 3 inches of naked wire.The product would be great if not this really bad naked wire issue... I am affraid I have to find new headphones."
4,"good sound, good price","This is the second pair of these headphones that I've owned. I lost the first pair after using them for over a year. For some reason though, this pair sounds better than the first...much less hiss than the first pair, and I don't need to jam them into my ear as far in order to hear them clearly. I use them on the bus for the passive noise cancelation, and for that purpose they work great. With plain earbuds you need to crank up the volume to drown out the engine noise...over time I can only imagine what that does the eardrums.On the downside, I wish the cord had a volume control, and it seems a little long with the extension, and it's too short without. I didn't have any trouble with cord durability on my original pair like some previous reviewers have mentioned. But given the price, I don't think you can beat these."
2,Disappointing for Sony,"I read the reviews on his product and because of the price I thought it was worth a try to replace my IPOD earbuds. Unfortunately, it was a disappointing result. Not only were they uncomfortable, the sound was not that much better than the IPOD's and the long cord that you are forced to use, was perplexing and poorly designed. I have them in a draw somewhere and looking at maybe the Bose or higher end sound canceling headphones."
1,Shoddy quality,"Just like several other reviewers, I experienced a sudden loss of signal in one channel - in my case, it came after about 10 months of light use. Not recommended!"
3,"good sound, poor design","sitting in my apartment these headphones seemed great. they canceled out the noise fairly well, and the sound quality was superior to my ipod 'phones by far. but wearing them around nyc, i found that the little metal joiner clip (that says Sony) kept tugging the headphones out of my left ear, the short, standard cord was too short and the extension cord too long, leaving a foot of wire hanging out of my pocket, which left me wrapping cord around my ipod or stuffing it into my pocket in a ball. most annoying was that no matter what ear bud size i tried, they still fell out after minimal activity, such as going down the subway steps. 2 months into them i am now having a problem with the noise lower in one headphone than the other, and will try and return them. sony needs to work on it's design."
1,Sound great but flimsy. Will not last.,"I tried the cheaper in ear noise cancelling Sony earphones and they broke in a very short amount of time. I figured the more expensive version would be more durable. I WAS WRONG. These broke in an even shorter amount of time - 2 weeks. $50 is a lot to spend on disposable headphones. I guess Sony makes all of their products disposable; portable CD-players, stereos, etc. Sony customer service also sucks. Pray you'll never have to deal with them. Better yet, just don't buy Sony and go with Shure. It is more but worth it because it will last. Buy from a company that doesn't believe in disposable products."
3,Fantastic sound and comfort... at a price,"These are by far the most comfortable pair of earphones I've ever worn. I've never been able to wear anything for more than a couple of hours, but these, I could wear for four hours a day with zero problems.WARNING: Enclosed earphones like these, while blocking out external noise, don't let your ears ""air out"". A little bit of moisture sits on the ear drums, and like soaking your hands in water, this thin layer of skin wrinkles.I took too long to associate my ear pain with these phones, and while my hearing is still fine (for now), I have constant ear pain that the doctors haven't been able to get rid of yet (6 months later)It's now been 2 years and my ear pain, while less, is still with me."
2,Great Sound Quality - Poor volume and comfort,"I bought these headphones to replace the not so great ones that came with my iPod. The sound quality is great, which is expected form Sony. However, the volume needs to be considerably higher than with the standard headphones to get he same amount of sound. Considering battery life is already an issue with iPods, whis only makes it worse. Also, after only a short while, they begin to make my ears sore, even with the smallest bud on it."
2,Fooled again,"Once again I'm amazed at how the reviews were so highly in favor of this product. These are terribly uncomfortable (for my ears) and don't really provide that great of listening experience. The frequency response seems muted until you use the largest possible ""surrounds"", and then they become distractingly uncomfortable. But of course, this is just my experience, your mileage may vary, as they say. Personally, I found my Apple iPod 'phones to be better."
2,Don't waste your money,"Comfort is tops, but I think I would go so far as to say the specs for this headphone are a lie. On none of the several players I use is there any change whatsoever (contrary to other phones) in the sound with changes in EQ (likewise for Koss' similar pair, by the way)--that's telling me that bass and treble are beyond the scope of what these can reproduce, and that's what my ears are telling me,too. Transparency is lacking, as well.They're much cheaper, and I know they don't have the glamor, but Sony's MDR-W08L phones deliver more sound for the $$$, though not at the same comfort level. I keep looking for (and buying) sealed in-ear phones that promise deliver better sound than the MDR-W08L for anything like a reasonable price, and I haven't found them yet. Look, the MDR-W08L costs peanuts--Sears has them for seven bucks in their stores. Buy a set and use them for comparison--see if you don't agree that they're hard to beat. These aren't the ones."
3,Extended Frustration,"Sound quality is good but the connection for the extension cord has been bad on both sets (I returned one and the second has the same problem). If I hold it just right I get stereo but once I insert the plug to where it will stay in by itself, I only hear through one ear. If I don't use the extension, there's no problem...except that I need to have my head a few inches from my computer.I also think the design that gives you 4 times the amount of length on one side of your head than the other is bad....but that's a minor annoyance compared to the lack of stereo."
1,Do not expect tonal accuracy from this earphone,"I regretted that I bought this earphone. I have been using Sennheiser HD580, an audiophile grade headphone, and its PX250, a noice cancelling headphone, a Sony wireless headphone, a high grade earphone by Panasonic, a JVC headphone and many earphones that come with the gadgets including my ipod and a Sony net MD player. The sound quality of the Sony MDR-EX71SL is disappointing particularly at this price. It basically boosts up the bass that probably pleases some but I found it annoying when you really look for an accurate reproduction of the original recording. The exaggerated bass or one note bass, whatever you call it, is not what I would recommend. Now I might try to see if Shure E3C will do a better job."
1,iPod Users BEWARE! Includes All Other Users Too!,"I bought Sony earbud based on price, on CNet review, and on my previous investments from higher end Sony earphones.-The earbud is strange to use. It is kind of gross to push the earbud deep into the ear.-The extension code is simply too long and heavy, which will pull down on the left earbud. If you don't use the extension cord, it is simply too short.-These earbuds are simply horrible, awful, and even $7 Nintendo GameBoy Advance headphones are better than this Sony crap.*I was fooled by CNet's review, fooled by reviews from other Amazon users, and fooled by my previous experience with Sony earphones.**My recommendation is to use your original iPod earphone or try the upgrade iPod earphone.***There is simpily nothing positive to say about this earbud."
1,Poor sound,"I was conned by so many good reviews about this product and forked out SGD 80 for it. The sounds were really soft and at times very harsh. It is poorer than the SGD 20 oem earphones I bought, and much much poorer than my default earphones bundled with my NZ90 Clie PDA. Complete waste of $$$!!"
1,I hate it,"I hate this product. I'm used to regular Sony headphones that hang outside my ears. This goes into the ear, and in an effort to block out external noise gives TONS of internal feedback. So when I'm on the treadmill I hear every breath I take louder than the music I'm trying to listen to, and each time I cough or sneeze it's really horrible. I would return the product, but decided it's not worth the effort."
1,It has very good sound quality but I had the same problem...,"I bought Sony MDR-EX71SL. I used it for two months. One day, the left earbud no sound. I though maybe I had borken it when I put it in my pocket.Then, I bough my second earbud -- Sony MDR-EX51LP . It had the same problem when I used it after 2 weeks. Even worst, because I use the first one longer then the second one. What I said, sound quality is great, but the product quality isn't as good as you thing."
2,"OK, but...","Just received these phones, sound and fit is better than those that came with my iPod and the hard case is a nice touch.What I don't like is that the cord is too short, 24"" at best. I'm 5'11"" and it barely reaches my waist. If I turn my head, I'll rip out one of the earbuds. What was Sony thinking?? Sure, they added an extension, but that adds weight and an extra connection. Obviously an afterthought on Sony's part. What if you wanted to put your player on a nearby table? Not going to work unless you're right nest to it. Nearly every other manufacturer of in-ear phones has at least a 48"" cord.(...) For daily use they're useless. (...)"
4,Great for instrumental pieces; so-so for vocal or voice only,"Given the strong reviews and the recent price break, I decided to purchase a pair for travel use. On balance, I would still recommend them, especially if your playback device contains a tone adjustment.I don't believe other reviewers have mentioned the very noticeable sibilant sounds (s, sh, ch etc) that make listening to vocals or speech somewhat distracting and tiring. You may have a better sample or batch, but my headphones sounded that way from day one. If your device has it, adjusting the treble DOWN will make the sibilant sounds much less intrusive.In conclusion, the MDREX71SL will find its place in my carry-on. I'll have to wait to check how well these phones will seal out the aircraft noise."
2,I wish I didn't have to gamble,"With the recent purchase of the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia Headphones with Closed Type Design. I confirmed the fact I don't like a canal type of headphone. This paticular pair would not stay in your ear, decreasing the sound quality, and sometimes completely falling out. Although this product came with some replacment buds in different sizes it came with only one each, what good is that. Ear bud headphones are a gamble, it's like buying underwear. You never know how they will fit until you get home to try them on, and then no one else will want to try them on. I guess I'll have to stick with the reliable giant cans until some comes up with a comfortable, good sounding pair of ear buds."
3,decent but definitely overhyped,"I recently purchased the rio carbon (which died on me after only 3 weeks) and was compelled to replace the supplied headphones due to horrible sound quality and ill-confort. After reading a couple of online reviews, I decided to grab the sony fontopia. The sound quality is difinitely better than the headphones that came with my rio, but it was nothing to scream about. I don't think it supplied enough base. On the plus side, they fit comfortably in my ears and it does a good job blocking outside noises even though it's not a noise reduction headphone. For it's price I wouldn't recommend it but if money is not a major issue, why the hell not. If money is not an issue to you, you'd probably invest in a much better headphone anyway."
4,Sounds Great But the Cord is too short,"These earbuds sound great and are a great buy but what was Sony thinking when they designed the cord? The cord (without extension) is only about 18 inches long. Unless you have your device in your shirt pocket, the cord won't reach."
3,A little too supple,"I'm not a super freaky, audio geek. The phones work. They block a lot of the outside noise. I can work all day and not be bothered extraneous office distractions. They sound good too. The only problem is that the wires are very soft and supple, and they wear through very easily. I wore them all day working the yard and the wire leading to the left ear was rubbed and twisted. In the coming days the twist wore through the casing and now there is a tear in it exposing the wire inside. I'm not really sure if it is reparable. I don't think so. I really like these phones, but I may have to go with something more rugged."
2,Nice sounds poor durability,"Like many older reviews...these buds sound and fit great. But, the cord wears out quickly exposing the bare wire."
2,"Good sound and fit, terrible build quality","As far as I'm concerned Sony owes me a free pair of these. I originally bought the EX51s and they failed at about 6 months. I replaced them with EX71s and they failed in about 6 months. Both times on the left side. They just die. This is a VERY common complaint and Sony hasn't improved the durabilty. I'm tired of the Sony tax.I've noticed alot of people like me however who must be slow learners. The way they fit and isolate one from outside noise when out and about seduces one into buying another pair when they fail, only to have them fail again.Too bad Sony is so irresponsible as to (seemingly) ignore these design problems.Other comments:Annoying asymmetrical cord arrangment that (no doubt) contributes to the cord's failure.The EX71's have a too short cord and a too long extension for the cord. Neither seems a good length."
5,Great value when used correctly,"One word sums up these headphones: Wow.All of the problems being stated by other users is strictcly because of misuse, they need to be put ALL THE WAY IN in order to get bass. Also, they need to seal in your ears, they give multiple bud sizes, try another set of buds. Lastly, about the cord, it is designed to be worn around the back of your neck, so when you take out a side, it doesn't hang down below your belt.I feel that these headphones are better than over-ear headphones in the price range of 150 dollors. They are great for use with computers, and I have been using it with my iPod, and it sounds great. These headphones are by far the best in-ear headphones i've used, and are a great buy for the price."
3,Mine broke as well....,"Just like another reviewer below, mine worked great. Then the right one just stopped working. I noticed the rubber ring connected to the wire was lose. I pulled back on it and found this green gunk all the way around the plug. Aparently the copper wasn't sealed properly and corroded. There is no lose wire and it is impossible to take the bud apart to fix it. I did get a great 10 months out of them. Very high quality sound and they block out the screaming babies on planes very well. If only the design wasn't flawed...."
3,Languid,"I was sooo excited to get these head phones and they were awsome for about the first month. They are comfortable in my ear and i thought nothing was better. But then for some reason they broke. The whole left earbud wouldn't work but the right one was fine. I'm one of those people that when they read reviews and hear that the product breaks... i'm just like ""Well that won't happen to me"", but this product did break. These are awesome head phones until they break and if you buy them i wish you the best of luck that they don't break."
1,Avoid,"The audio quality was much better than my previous headphones. But after about four months of occasional use, the right headphone died.The warranty is 90 days. Judging from the other reviews, you're lucky if they last that long. Once the 90 days are up, Sony will exchange them for a refurbished pair for $28.64 (more than the cost of a new pair on Amazon). No thank you."
1,Perfect...Until they broke,"so i bought these for $50 bucks. i was amazed...good bass good highs but when there were too many sounds going on like in Halo...they got this cracked distorted sound. o by the way, the people complaining about the bass response clearly didn't read the instructions. they stated ""earphones must have right size and must fit snuggly in ear or bass response may be lost"" basicaly it means choose the right size or there will be no base at all. i got perfect base. one problem is the sound containment on the outside was horrible, i got continually nagged to turn it down to the point where i couldnt hear it. then not even 6 months later...they broke! the left earbud went dead for no reason at all. no earwax in the mesh or anything. im mad cuz i wasted $50 bucks for a broken product. BUY THIS PRODUCT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!! IM GOING BACK TO THE APPLE EARBUDS!"
5,Great headphones for the price,"This is the 3rd pair I've owned. The others broke because I was stupid (for example, I let them hang out of the cardoor as I drove off). They are great headphones. They stay in my ear without difficulty and having the short and long cords is great."
1,Beware Shocks,"First off, I am not a Sony hater. In fact, I would highly recommend the Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP in place of these earbuds. Although the sound quality is extremely good (same as the other earbuds I mentioned), the connector for the cord is terrible. Not only does it call weight issues when walking or jogging with the 2 pieces connected, but because the metal is exposed, the earbuds pick up static when it moves against cotton. Plus, it causes shocks. I have been shocked once on my arm where the connector touched me and 3 times in my ear. This is unacceptable. I'm throwing my pair out and buying the older model. Stay away from this model."
2,sound is very good but fit is awkward,"I bought these after reading the Amazon reviews. The sound through the headphones is good. However, the fit with any of the three different size rubber earbud covers is awkward and the earbuds fall out of my ears when running or biking or weightlifting. Of course, all ear shapes and sizes are different, but I would strongly recommend you attempt to try these for size elsewhere before ordering online."
4,Ideal for my commute,"I use these for my daily 45-minute commute on the bus. I had previously used the earbuds that came with my CD player, but I was turning up the volume so much to block out the noise of the talking and the bus engine that I thought I was going to lose my hearing.These are ideal for my commute because they block most but not all of the noise for my commute. So, I can still hear the bus start and stop, but it's muffled in the background and my music is in the foreground. I'm not so cut off from the world that I miss my stop, and I don't have to turn the volume up so loud that I'll be deaf before I'm 30."
3,Sounds to good to be true,"The sound quality is decent, the build is decent, but the design leaves a little to be desired.The package contains almost every accessory you could ever want. There is a general sense of attention to detail in each accessory, an attention to detail which seems to largely be lost on the speakers them selves.The speakers sound alright and produce especially (and unexpectedly) rich base notes while struggling a bit with mid-high's.The speaker wiring however is awkward to say the least. The usual Y like split between the left and right speaker occurs aprox. 3 inches from the left speaker. This makes for uneven weight distribution and a sour left ear.Buy the speakers for there sound qualiaty, throw them away from frustration and for the sake of your throbbing left ear."
4,Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia Headphones,These are decent headphones. I thought they were closed style. Good in silent atmosphere. The case containing headphones easily breaks. I had to use a rubberband to keep it closed.
3,Too expensive now,"I purchased these back in 2006 when it was 29.99 and I've gotten some for less before as well. The sound quality and comfort is great. However, the plastics started wearing out now.But now what the heck is up with the huge price increase now? $41+? No thanks. Note: Avoid he white one, the plastics are different from the black one and will wear out MUCH faster. I've owned 2 whites and 2 black ones before."
2,Not great sound,Fit well but did not sound great. Cheap/generic headphones sound better but if your looking for fit vs. sound quality - they were okay.Would not recommend these.
2,Great until they break,"I really like the sound that these inexpensive buds gave until one of them conked out. Thinking that perhaps this was just bad luck or a fluke I returned to Amazon to buy another pair but see that this problem has occurred with other customers so I'm going with a different make and model--Sennheiser CX 300 as they are similar in price, rated well, and no mention of any problems with them breaking."
4,"Great sound, better than Shure SE110","The sound coming out of these phones are excellent, good for electronic and rock music. Clear bass and mids. The unfortunate thing is that the rubber glued to the buds eventually lose their grip and begin peeling off after over a ear or 2's use. The sound quality is much better than Sure's SE110, and half the price. The rubber tips do a decent isolation job for the price. You will still hear subway noise, but it'll be 7-15% less bothersome compared to earphones that don't go in your ear."
5,Best pair of earbuds available!,"just bought my third pair! i am actually quite relieved to find that these are still available. bought my first pair in 2003, so they eventually wear out after about a year of CONSTANT use.the cord is a bit of an annoyance but you get used to it. just make sure you use that little clear plastic case (not the bigger silver one) to put the buds into or they'll tangle up for sure. i also clip that clear case around the cord when i'm using them. i find the silver case completely useless (except for something else lol).yeah you definitely have to snug the buds into your ear to get best sound but not too far or the bass is lost.i wish the entire cord was made with thicker material because they would last longer.as far as sound they're the best earbuds i've ever used (even the SHURE lower priced models! $[...]). never had any loss of sound or distortion or any malfuntion. can't say that for any other headphone i've bought."
2,Maybe it's just me . . .,"Maybe it's just me, but these haven't lived up to my expectations. The sound doesn't seem that much better than the ear buds that came with my MP3 player. On top of that, I can't get them to stay in my ears. I have really small ear canals, so again maybe it's my fault. Even when using the smallest set of ear plugs I can't get them in fair enough to block out ambient noise and they fall out every time I move my head. I would not recommend these headphones for people with small ear openings."
1,whats the point of an earbud without wires?,I bought these earbuds based on the decent reviews they got from most people. I saw the warnings about the wires fraying when you use these in intense situations like working out. I figured I only need them to listen to my computer while sitting at my desk so I wouldn't need to worry about the wires fraying on me. Wrong! I've used this headphones for maybe 6 weeks just sitting at my computer desk and I already have the insulation totally worn away on a section of wire and now its a matter of time for it to rip and become useless. Apparently the minor actions of just coiling and uncoiling these headphones for starage is enough to wear away the wires over a matter of just 6 weeks! This is in-excusable quality and I expected alot better from Sony.
1,Very disappointed,I bought this one in Jan. 2006. The sound quality was fine then. I only used it occasionally. In May 2006 I found out that the left earbud died. It only comes with a 90 days limited warranty. I thought Sony could do much better.
3,"Great sound, bothersome cord.","Pros: Great sound, even in high pressure environments like the subway. Good size selection on the earbuds.Cons: main cord was too short to be useful to me unless I kept my music device in a shirt pocket or inside jacket pocket. With the extension cord attached, I felt the cord ""weighing down"" on my ears and it ended up being too uncomfortable for me to wear every day.I ended up changing to the MDR-EX51LP which also has decent sound and no heavy extension cord, but persistent build quality problems (the cable wrap has disintegrated on two pair in the past year.)"
1,short life,"This is a nice headphone. I purchase it twice in my life, but will never buy it again. The first one stopped working after 2 months. It was still under the three months of warranty, and so I exhanged for a new one for free (except the shipping cost). The exchanged one last a little longer, almost half a year. Since I really like the headphone, I purchased a new one. This time, it stopped working one week after 3 months. The repair cost is $29, and therefore if I really want it, I'd better buy a new one instead of repair. I always take good care of the headphone, and I am not a heavy user. I really would not recommend it unless you are willing to spend $28 every 3 months."
4,"Good phone, but easily blocked by earwax","I have been using these headphones for 6 months now and I have been very happy with the sound quality, and I love the portability. I use them with my iPod remote and so the cord length has not been a real problem. I especially appreciate that they block out a lot of the ambient noise around me when I am on the bus or a plane.However, after a couple of months, the sound volume dropped to almost a whisper in one of the ears. A couple of weeks later, the same thing happened in the other ear. I discovered that what had happened was that ear wax had built up on the ear phone screen and in some of the grill openings. Once I removed the wax using a small tool (I used a mechanical pencil) the sound quality was restored to normal. Other than the problems with blockage due to ear wax, these have been the best pair of headphones I have owned."
3,"Very good sound, design glitches","The sounds and outside noise deadening featues of these buds are very good. However, some of the non-audio design decisions keep me from really liking this product - particularly when being used while exercising.The length of the cord is very short (~12 inches). This was seemingly intended for those who wear their player on their arm. An extension is included, but it is actaully too long. The combined length does not fit well into the included case.Worse, the plug is larger and heavier than a standard jack, so the weight of the plug causes it to bounce around very noticeably if you are using the buds while exercising.Finally, as others have mentioned, the cord on one side is longer then the other. I find this annoying, again because of the effect is one sided when being used while exercising.One added feature, the product indicates two sizes of ear adaptors; mine actually came with three."
2,Service problem,"While I enjoy the comfort and clean sound, the extension cord was defective from the package. The pigtail on the speakers is too short to use exclusively. All attempts to get a replacement without delivering the cord to an authorized repair facility failed. The closest facility is 3hrs. one way from me and mailing was not an option, nor is the extension available as an option. Sony's repair service policy is unacceptable!"
1,Awful,"This earphones are awful. It's like a frigging Lego- it has 3 pieces you have to connect one into another. The phones itself have a VERY short cord so you have to connect it to the extension that is SUPER long and has a mic with a button. Seriously, when was the last time anybody needed one on earphones? But that is not it just yet, it has another small cord( couple of inches long) that has to be connected to this whole structure to be able to plug it in the player. you cannot skip any of those part so the options are either use a very short cord or play Lego (earphones first, then extension cord with a mic, and then the small connector cord). When pulled on the cord even slightly, one of the connections would go weak, distorting the sound. I can see it breaking( or me breaking it lol) in a couple of months.Don't waste your money. I wasn't able to return it to Amazon."
2,"Decent Sounding, Horribly Made","I've had two pairs of these. The sound is decent, it's a little heavy on the bass, and the highs are pretty shrilly, but they are definitely a good pair for 10 bucks. The problem I have is that these are by far the worst headphones quality wise. I bought one which lasted for a couple of months, and the second died after four days."
1,purchase another,sounds ok for the money but the thing comes in several parts to short in some areas and to long in others i dont know what they were thinking when they came up with this
2,Small problem,"I got the headphones as i need a replacement for my old ones. these fit and sound the same but the cord on the headphones is very short. the extension that it comes with has a mic on it and when i plug it into my phone, it does not fit all the way and makes it so only one head phone works. i only wanted headphones with a decent length cord and this did not fit it for me"
1,Fantastic...before they break,"I've owned two pairs of these delightful little buds from Sony. I absolutely love them, until they break. A few months into using them, both sets have cut out on me. I'm not hanging from them, using them as a jump rope, or flossing with them; I'm just using them whilst at the gym and when riding the bus. They are super comfortable, have a surprising amount of bass, and have great sound quality, but they just don't seem to last. If you can baby them and treat them like a faberge egg, I'm sure you'll love them."
1,Junk,"Sound quality was great and a gret upgrade from the stock ipod earbuds, but these only lasted me a couple months. The wiring peeled off almost the entire length of the headphones. I tried using electrical tape, but it only got worse. If you like spending money on garbage then go ahead and buy these."
3,"Great, while it lasted","These headphones are great. They come with a hard case which protects them from when you're not using them. The sound quality is great and the bass is very deep. They would from time to time slip out of the ear when running, or doing something else that is very active. However it only gets a three because, although reasonably priced, they broke in a little less than three months. The warranty, which is 90 days should be covered but its confusing and hard to figure out how to send it back. So if you're willing to pay $30 for a product that last three months then get them, but if you need something that lasts longer looks somewhere else."
3,Good for some people,"I enjoyed these headphones until I lost all the little ear buds because they popped out when I was pulling my iPod in and out of my pants. Also, the extension cord in the one I got didn't work so I spent another $40 on the same exact headphones without the extension cord."
3,I didn't like them... you might...,"The sound was fine, but the ear fit was a real problem for me. I found a much less expensive set that were similarly designed at Radio Shack that fit me much better and had the same quality sound (to my admittedly dubious ear).When it comes to in ear headsets, I find that fit is the most important thing and that's just trial and error, so good luck and start with the less expensive ones so it doesn't hurt as much when it doesn't fit well <grin>..."
1,Horrible,"I purchased these for my iphone and quickly realized that they were garbage. I did homework and read reviews and these were supposedly better than a pair that I had heard (which I liked). Not even close. The volume level was low, static when connector moved around, and overall sound was just not good. I'm not sure if all of these are the same, but the pair I got was horrible."
2,"Good for music, bad for exercising","I was looking forward to a great pair of earphones that I could take to the gym...and while they're great on the subway, these STINK on the treadmill. A little bit of sweat is all you need for them to pop out of your ears, and once that happens, you're out of luck."
2,Amazing sound - terrible usability,"these headphones have the best sound i've ever had in a pair of headphones - i couldn't be any happier with them.although...1) the cords tangle easier than anything i've ever had and they're NOT easy to untagle,2) the carrying ""case"" is a joke,3) the cord length is way too short without the extension and way too long with it,4) there's nothing that enables the cord to be secured to jackets or shirts so the weight of the cord tends to pull the buds out of the ears, AND5) after six months of having them (white) the cord is starting to dissolve and expose the wires. yeah, it's actually disintegrating... nasty.as much as i love the sound on these babies, i really can't recommend them to anyone... fix the design sony and i'll sing your praises once again."
5,"Great sound, Great Bass, Great Price",I'm not much of a 'go out and buy and test everything' type of guy. I'm more of the 'read all of the reviews and select the best product for the best price' type. I did such with these headphones and it was well worth it. These are great for noise cancellation and awesome sound. I work as an engineer on my computer sitting on a factory floor and when I have these on I can't hear anything but great sounding music with incredibly perfect bass inside of my head. It's like I'm creating the music right inside of my head. I would recommend these to anyone who doesn't know a whole lot about the whole spectrum of inner-ear head phones and doesn't care to. If you don't want to spend hardly anything and get an amazing sound this is your stop.AND! as an added bonus they come with a great carrying case.
5,This is my second pair. They are great.,"Like I said above, I am on my second pair of these. The first pair made it over two years of daily 5 mile workouts on an eliptical crosstrainer. Believe me they held up well considring they got sweat soaked almost every day of their life. These phones really bring out the bass beat and are for the money some of the best sounding headphones on the market. When this pair wears out, I will get some more. They are light years ahead of the cheap foam covered earbuds in sound and comfort. You don't even realise you are wearing headphones with these on."
5,Excellent,Got these the other day from Amazon. Let me say they are very good for the price. I had the Shure E5's which are their top of the line inear monitor and they were incredible. Ended up selling them and looking for a cheaper replacement. Tried numerous earphones and they were all terrible just terrible nothing even close to the Shure's. Purchased these Sony's sort of on a long shot hoping they would be acceptable- they are fantastic not too far off from the sound I had grown accustomed to with the Shure's certainly acceptable listening. I highly recommend these Sony's for the price they are an incredible value really amazing.
4,Love these Headphones,"These headphones are a great bargain. Good sound quality and nice base. Plus they do a good job of blocking out other sounds. The only problem I have with them is over time the cable seems to deteriorate. But for the price you get a year out of them and then purchase another pair. I have three pairs of them. One I use for yard work, one when I exercise, and one for out and about. One item I really like is they have a shorter cord so if you use a arm band for your IPOD player or put the IPOD in your shirt pocket or chest pocket you have just the right length of cord. Though they give an extension section should you want a longer cord. They are in the ear design so if you don't like something pushed into your ear canal, you may not like these."
4,"Great through most frequencies, but...","I love all of my Sony earbud headphones for the sound. However, I only use them with my iPod and iRiver players, and once in a while my laptop. The Fontopia's have one peculiarity that affects the rating: the in-cord plug for extension is heavy and makes the headphones heavy. We're only talking an ounce or two, but it pulls on the earbuds or line to the earbuds with the slack below the connection. They should have put the connection further down the line although if you use an MP3 player in a breast pocket, these are fine.The behind-the-neck cord takes some getting used to. After three years, I still have a problem periodically with the line getting caught on collars and jacket zippers. And I've lost at least six of the earbud covers while walking the dog. The line gets caught, comes out of my ear, and the cover goes flying into the leaves or bushes or worse. Can't buy them individually either.Even so, I prefer them to those that hang from your ears."
3,"good sound, disappointing product longevity","I enjoyed these ear phones for about 11 months at which time the insulting coating on the wire which is worn nearest the body started to become soft and gooey, allowing the wires to break. I took good care of these ear phones and I feel they should have lasted longer, I fault the manufacturer for using poor quality materials."
3,"Longer cord, please","The earpieces are comfortable and stay put, and the audio fidelity is fine. My only issue with these headphones is the short cord. Yes, there is an extension cord, but that makes the cord as ridiculously long as the cords on all my other headphones. By contrast, this cord is too short to reach the audio outlet on many of the cardio machines in the gym I attend.If you stay close to your audio source, or don't care about this feature, they are excellent and a great value."
2,Good sound...when they work.,"I purchased my first pair and was happy with the sound on the headphones (particularly because it blocks out the noisy city so I can hear my music), until one earphone suddenly died and no sound would come out of it anymore. Of course, it was outside the 90-day warranty period, so Sony offered to replace it with a refurbished pair for almost the same cost that I paid for a NEW pair!! Well, being a loyal Sony customer, I chalked it up to being a defective pair and purchased another because I liked the headphones so much. Well, after 5 short months of normal (not heavy) use, the cord is frayed in two places and (not shocking) Sony said I'm out of warranty and offered to replace with a refurbished pair for over $30!! NOT happy with Sony or their customer service. Buyer beware of these earphones, or do yourself a favor -- buy the Amazon coverage for $6 and save yourself the hassle of dealing with Sony customer service!!"
3,Too short or Too long,"my biggest complaint is that cord is too short for anything, unless you have pocket on you arm or shoulder. It does come with extended cord but cumbersome, it's weighs down the whole cord due to it's connector weight, you constantly have be aware of where connector is located (on top of table, in your pocket....). Low bass, unless you stick it in to your ear with your hand hold, than bass is decent. other than that it's pretty decent. it blocks out all noises and other people can't hear what you are listening."
3,Awesome sound with a Closed-Crap Design,"The sound on these earphones is excellent. The closed design does actually cancel a lot of outside noise. The bass is pretty clear and deep, highs are crystal, but you have to get the headphones pretty far into your ear to get the full sound.HOWEVER...The design of the cord is wholly retarded. Who in their right mind would design the left cord so short? I can't explain how frustrating--and embarassing--it is to have a two-foot cord hanging from one side of my face, and a three-inch cord dangling with a silver plastic piece attached from the other side.In order to have a cord long enough to reach from my pocket or backpack, I have to use the extension, which is far too long. So rather than have a couple feet of cord divided evenly to each headphone, you get 80% of the cord's lenght going to one side, 20% to the other side, while the overall length is too short to put in my pocket.Awful, abhorrent design; great sound. Choose wisely."
2,NOT IF YOU HAVE AN IPOD AND LIKE TO EXERCISE!,"I think these were made for a walkman that sits at your waste or inside a bag. I CAN'T STAND the asymetrical wires. Why is one side longer than the other? Someone mentioned that they were that way so that people with remotes could use them. Why does the apple store even carry these things?? The sound is the only reedeming quality. The buds are comfy but the cord keeps whacking me in the face when I run. Bottom line: it shouldn't be that hard to wear, run, and store them (the storage box is too small). I'm taking these back to where they came from!"
3,Not worth the money.,"You'd be better off buying a basic set of headphones at a fraction of the price. Trust us. We can't evaluate every product, but we do research as many as we can. We've discovered that, although this product is one of the best, its not worth the money compared to others of similar quality."
2,Good sound but at the cost of inconvenience,"Well, I bought these headphones couple of days back mainly thinking of the noise cancelling aspect. They do average on that aspect but don't have high expectation about noise cancelling. It's been a month and I frequently watch DVDs on my laptop and after half an hour it starts giving pain in the ears. This closed type design is not at all comfortable. Many times you feel the that the earphone is coming out of your ear.Sound is as usual great, no doubt about that. I guess when you are going for Sony that's pretty much assured and that's what Sony is known for. But design aspect wise I'm planning to abandon them as the long hour listening is giving severe pain."
1,Simply horrible,"I recently bought these as an upgrade to the headphones that came with my Creative Vision:M. After trying out every set of headphones I could find around the house (including some from the Walkman era), these were simply the worst. The sound is absolutely terrible - no bass at all, and horrible distortion in the mids.Another thing: the cord length is just bizarre. To use the phones without the extension, you'd have to mount your player on your forehead. Put on the provided extension, and you can put the player in your shoe."
2,"Don't use in the Gym, or for running","The earphones sounded good in the ear, good bass/mid/treble, and they do block outside noise well. The weird thing those is that they create noise because now you can hear your breathing, heartbeat and while running this is VERY annoying. For light gym workouts they are ok, but not for heavy cardio. I also felt that I had a real hard time running any distance and would constantly sweat while I had them in. I talked to my running club about this, and they said it's probably because they are blocking your ear from regulating your internal body temp. So basically my ear thinks it's like 110 degrees out, and kicks my body temp up as well. All I know is that I could barly run a 10K with them in, and the next time I ran, I did the 10K training run, no problem at all.For me they were just too weird and I also didn't like how isolated they made you feel. I'm going back to my old favorite, a new pair of Koss Portapro's and for at home Grado Sr-80's(...)"
1,"Great Sounds, Horrible Quality","I got these headphones and thought they were great. They sounded like it was a minature subwoofer with crisp sound quality. I was happy with it and bragged about how great they were...until a month passed...After a month the right side of the ear buds completely died on me. Someone suggested to me that it might be ear wax -.-"" and after poking it with a pin it was perfectly clean. The ""solution"" didnt work at all and once again i was left in a stump.My one month warranty expired and it didn't make sense how they just stopped working when i just use it on daily basis for listening purposes with my mp3.Now i am left with my default headphones that came with my iriver and it really disappoints me that after going through many reviews i still ended up with a much disappointed headphone..."
1,Suxxxxxxx,"I've had these earphones for a couple of months now and they do suck. Let me reiterate. The sound is awesome. The design sucks big ones. First off the rubber around the wires deteriorated away and the wires are showing. Apparently the rubber is a new type of rubber that Sony uses that is susceptible to deteriorating from exposure to oxygen because all i did was wear them. I had to put electrical tape all around it to protect the wire. My headphone now look like i got them from a bondage club with all the tape I had to wrap around it. Sony should give me a refund for this monstrosity. I will never buy products from them again. Ok, just the Playstation but that is it. Maybe a receiver but i'm putting my foot down after that."
3,"Eh...,","This are my first good heaphones I have tried, my first impression was like wow!!! Unlike what has hapened to other people they look and feel very good, I bought two pairs, one for me and one for my syster, I paid $100 dollars for both at the local store.I was very satisfied with them until I found ""The Spark plug"", fromKOSS. They are way cheaper and the sound is just as good."
2,"Poor design, Good sound","I thought I purchased a defective pair and took it back to the store because the ends of the cords are UNEVEN. The right side is 1/4 shorter than the left. I put it on and the extra length is supposed to lie on the back of your shoulders. This is a little wierd for me because I am used to even cord lengths and my headphones forward.Otherwise the sound quality is very good, but the cord length is such a design flaw that I am already looking for another pair of headphones."
1,Major disappointment,"Great concept, but faulty beyond belief. The first day I tried them they were quite good. It took a little adjustment to get use to having this plugs in my ear (but more comfortable than the Koss ""Plug"" I used previously). Sound quality was quite good and a good amount of external sound (loud train noises, rude people talking at the top of their lungs on trains, idiots screaming into cell phones, etc) was blocked. But, by day two, I had to start turning the volume on my portable all the way up to get any appreciable sound (same problem occured on on PC).Also, the earbuds fall off much too easily (this should not happen in three days of use). I'm going back to KOSS."
2,OK for voice only,Very disppointing. No music sounds even close to as good as with the apple ear buds. They are ok for audiobooks and podcasts. Very confortable in the ears.
1,"Horrible, DO NOT buy...","Bought to replace my Dell DJ stock ear buds. After having these things for 3 months, I'm glad to say that I threw them in the creek during my run today. They never stayed in my ears during a run (trying all three size fittings). And yesterday the left bud started shorting out, It's just over the 90 day warranty, JUNK!!! My stock DJ buds stayed in better. The only good thing is they did sound good if you held them in your ears with both hands!!!!"
1,"For the price, I guess...??","1. The headphones produce a very tinny sound when listening to music or spoken word.2. The cable lengths between earbuds are uneven and will cause youo to constantly adjust your left earbud. It will fall out of your ear constantly.3. The headphone cable length from the earbuds to your MP3 player is too short. The extension cable is about 3 feet too long.I would not suggest purchasing these. Sorry Sony, you really should have tested these on real people before selling them."
1,Worst HeadPhones,"I bought these to replace the Radio Shack headphones I currently have, I was looking for something that was a bit longer so I could put the player in my pocket.The fit was nice, but that is the ONLY thing this product has going for it. The sound is atrocious, the sound level is so low I had to turn my player up 3/4 of the way to hear just anything.I would not recommend thse to ANYBODY even if they were being given away."
1,DO NOT BUY if you dont want grief!,"Only four months after buying these earphones and taking good care of them, the right earphone suddenly went dead for no apparent reason!! A friend of mine also experienced the same problem after two months of almost no use. The earphones also cant fit into their carrying case once you take them out. What is wrong with Sony?"
1,They were great while they lasted,"This were probably the best earphones I have ever got... for 2 months. After 2 months, the rubber cable deintegrated, because it cannot hold the heat of the cables (joule heat, for the engineers). I couldn't believe it when this little things were deintegrating on my own hands. Now I'm looking for a different brand, you should do the same thing."
2,What a shame!,"Great sound but the cord is a joke. Like others said with the original cord it won't reach your MP3 player on your belt or in your pocket. Isn't that where it usually is? So exactly what is the purpose of that cord. So now you hook it up to the extension cord & you have a bunch of extra wire to deal with. Like I said it's shame. They sound great & then they go & ruin it. Well back they go, I'm getting the Apple ones. Even if it's a drop off in sound it's better than getting annoyed everytime I use them."
1,Buyer Beware,I purchased these earphones 4 months ago. They were working well and I was happy. Then a couple of weeks ago I noticed the coating on the wires was disintegrating. My husband put electrical tape over the bare wires but the coating is continuing to disintegrate below the repair. The warranty from Sony is 90 days so I am out of luck. Don't purchase these earphones! Something is defective in the coating of the wires.
4,"Not so good, but fine","Good1. This is good when you use outdoor. This earphone intercept outdoor noise. Nomally in-the-ear earphone is very expensive. If you are lookinglow price in-the-ear earphone, this is best.BAD1. Sound is not good. It sound like that you turn on music in your room, and go out of the room and close the door, and listen out of the room. However, it is better than bundle earphone2. easy to broken, and I used both white and black. I can tell black is better than white. becuase white is easy fall of rubber. it's weak for water. Be careful raining day, and sweat.**If you use this earphone just outdoor, think of the EX51. Sound of Ex71 is better than EX51. But it just a little better. So You cannot notice sound different outside. and EX51 is cheaper than EX71."
3,Sony phones,"Short cord use for shirt pocket is nice. Weight of the connector on using the long cord is not good.Sound is better than ipod original, but could be better.External noise is blocked out well.Nice fit and adjustable sizes. Reasonable value for the money."
3,"Great sound, lousy design","Great having ear plugs that actually stay in my ears. I can finally hear the bass and other subtleties I was missing out on with my Ipod earplugs. However, I hate the design of the wire. One side is longer than the other. There's a little plastic connecter that hangs closer to one ear and when you move around it tugs the earplug out. Also the cord is very short so they give you an extender wire which is way too long (you have to take up the slack by wrapping it around a little case they provide--it's not very convenient). The jack from wire to wire creates added weight which also helps to pull the earphones out. I'd prefer the Sony ear plugs with the Ipod wires. The Ipod wires were easier to wrap around the Ipod when not in use, this is also due to the varying lengths of each ear plug wire. Don't understand the design at all. Can't see the benefit. Would rate a 3 and a half if I could."
5,Amazing!,"I was a little apprehensive about purchasing these from previous reviews I read. However, I did and I've had them for 2 months now. The sound is amazing and they fit very comfortably with two different sized buds, even for an extended time period. I haven't been that careful with them either and they are holding up very well. If I lose them, break them or give them away, I'll definitely purchase another pair!"
2,Great sound....poorly made,Had these for a couple of months and loved them...then it went bad. The sound is still great but the wires that go to the earpieces fell apart. I guess the wire covering is for comfort not for durability. The comfort factor goes out the window when there is no covering left. My headphones still work but most of the wire is covered in black electrical tape....Shame on you Sony!!!!
2,Great headphone while it lasted!!!,"Don't get me wrong this headphone was great and while I was traveling, it definitely drowned out all the engine noises. I never had such ""peaceful"" flights but just like everyone else, my cord ""dissolved"" within 6 months. I don't know what kind of material Sony uses but this is certainly one of the most inferior Sony products I ever used. Buyers beware!!!"
5,"Correction: THREE earbud sizes, and GREAT earphones!","These earphones come pre-fitted with (medium) earbuds but also provide two additional pairs - small & large.These earbuds are perfect if you'd be listening sitting (office, airplane, etc.). The earbuds greatly reduce outside noise and conversation, though, as some reviewers pointed out, they tend to function like a stethoscope. But the pros far outweigh the cons. If you're sitting, the stethoscope effect is minimal.Finally, as is usually the case, what separates Sony from other brands is not the specs, but the stuff that ISN'T in the specs, such as how light it feels, the stylish EXTRA carrying case (for the earphones, the extension cord, the additional earbuds, even the little detangler case, the whole package!), and the beauty!"
4,Good Value.,"These headphones do provide some noise isolation at a much cheaper price. I tried the Panasonic Noise Canceling ear buds and they were not good. I also tried the Koss QZPRO over the ear headphones and found them way too tight. However, the noise cancellation was good. These Sony headphones were a nice compromise. I just couldn't bring myself to spend the extra money on the Shure headphones."
3,Good sound. Bad cord design. No inline volume control,"These are the smallest headphones I've ever had and the sound that comes out is wonderful with pretty good bass. Also, the isolation is really good.But as a previous reviewer noted, the cord design is lacking. Without attaching the included extension cord, it reaches just below my shirt pocket... not useful for anything! With the included extension it's a bit too long (and heavy at the joint).Second thing I would like to have is an inline volume control for these, they don't have one."
2,Exaggerated and muddy bass,I liked EX51LP a lot but its cord was too long when used with an MP3 player with a neck strap. I ordered EX71SL mainly because it has a shorter cord. I read somewhere that both EX51LP and EX71SL share the same driver but I immediately noticed that they sound very different. EX71SL has too much bass that it drowns other frequencies. I'm going back to EX51LP.
4,very good but not excellent,Very good but not excellent because when I turned on the button on the back of the action figure he didn't talk and still doesn't!!!!
4,Heavy Machines + Kids = FUN!! Easy Setup!!,"Very Easy to Setup! The animation is crisp and seemless. The missions are very easy to start up and easy to play. The items are easy to move with your mouse, thus very fun and easy for kids. Many of the missions, all of which involve heavy powerful machinery, are easy to earn certificates for completion which is a great confidence booster! The software also comes with a mini-activity book for coloring. Overall it is a great game and a must buy for young children interested in adventures with the machines used by Police, Firefighters, Mountain Rescuers, etc."
3,so far so good but.....,I have a amd k6-2 400mhz computer w/vodoo banshee card(totally prehistoric sysem) running window 98se. It runs fine so far but occassionally the graphics freeze(possibly need to update drivers?) in certain tasks but eventually comes into sync and sometimes never. The audio continues fine but the mouse control is lost. The limited control of the vehicles is annoying (for adults) but my four year old son likes it.
3,Good beginner game.,Well this game is limited on play & it doesn't take too long to accomplish all the tasks. But on the other side it is a good game for a young child to learn how to use the mouse on.
1,disappointed,"it won't run, even with a brand new computer, little boy very disappointedwe have 2 new computers, won't run with either requires way too many downloads from the internet, takes up way too much space, then it still won't run"
1,DON'T buy this!,"I have a brand new computer with all the bells and whistles. I purchased Clifford's birthday party-great, Stuart Little Thinking and number adventures-great, and this Tonka search and rescue. My little boy was so excited as it loaded, then, we had to download x something or other to make it work, so I did, then it was something else, and something else. It never did play and now I had to undo everything. Piece of JUNK! In my opinion, DONT'T Buy This software. It also didn't install on my husband's computer."
4,i love swatch,"love the watch only the picture is a little misleading. The dial colour isn't as blue as the picture makes it out to be. It's actually a bit more greyish. Also, the band length is a tad bit too long (i have a 7"" wrist) so I'm going to have to take it in to get it adjusted.but other than that, i love it. very sleek"
4,All Around Inexpensive Toaster,Consumer reports recommended this model as a best buy. I like it and did have to learn how to early release items by moving lever sideways. Very light it seems durable but I would fear dropping it. A good cheap toaster.
1,Proctor Silex 22605 Toaster,Disappointing failure. This two-slice toaster broke after less than one month of use. Bread lifter would not stay down when pressed.
1,it is not working!,I bought this toaster and simple is not working!! it can't hold the bread slidesI don't think i will buy a toaster again from this brand
2,can't pop up toast before it's done,"Beware! Once you've selected the ""shade"" of how you want the toast, and depress the lever, the only way you can get it to stop earlier is to unplug it!! I hate that aspect. I keep my bread in the freezer, so it takes longer to toast. The first time I used it, I set it for too dark. The toast started burning. I tried pushing up on the lever like you would to most toasters, but nada! I had to unplug it to make it stop. Very poor design. Other than that, I like it. It's not only wide enough for bagels, but long enough for Branola or Orowheat bread, which not alltoasters are. I plug this into a surge surpressor now, so if it needs to come out early, I trip the surpressor, and the toast pops up."
1,"Avoid this Cool Wall model 22605, very uneven toasting.","Unlike the US-made toasters of bygone days that browned both sides equally, if this toaster is adjusted to do one side right it leaves the other side hardly toasted at all. If you set it for a longer time to get the light side done right then the other side gets burned. I don't see how it could do otherwise because if you look down into the slots at the heating elements, you can see that they are more numerous and closely spaced on the outside walls than on the inner. I don't understand how an old appliance company could do such bad engineering - I can only suppose that they don't use their own products now that they are made in China."
3,A bit slow .,Later I found the same toaster at a large retail store for 9$ (which was a sale price ) . It is a ok toaster I only have one problem with it. It replaced a extreamly old toster which toasted much quicker. Its slow . I think the reason is the toast holes are big so they can hold a bagel and I only toast sliced bead. So all the heat rushes out .
1,Piece of ****,"This toaster, given a ""Best Buy"" rating on Consumer Reports, was a piece of manure. It never toasted evenly, felt cheaply made, burned toast when set on low, and eventually, after only a few months, started sparking and then quit completely. It is currently in our garbage can. Avoid - cheap is NOT always good."
3,Picture is not correct toaster model,"I purchased this because the picture shows the toaster I have had for the last 4 years which worked really well. But the toaster I received is different. The actual 22605 toaster is shown on Amazon under the listing ""Proctor Silex Cool-Wall Toaster"". It has a rounded top and does not have the three wavy lines design next to the words Proctor Silex. The one pictured here is actually model 22205 and Amazon does not sell it anymore. I returned the 22605: it was flimsier than my old one, the electric heating wires were dented, and it was hard to push the toast up manually. Felt like it would have broken quickly. Gave it three stars cause it did toast the bread and what do you expect for $12."
3,slow....,Really slow toaster. Otherwise toasts evenly and nice. Is worth the low price if you are never in a hurry when toasting....I am not happy with it as I usually am in a hurry.
2,Chinzy,Cost is $20. Should be $10. Painted white metal sides are easily scratched or dented. Has a gap between sides and plastic ends. Toasted well though.
3,Basic & functional,Pretty much what you'd expect for a 20 buck toaster. I've only had it a few weeks put already the lever (the one you shove down when you want it to start toating) seems to be getting stuck.So maybe its not a very good buy.
2,Inadequate Browning,I bought this to replace my ancient toaster oven which no longer browns toast at all with a full cycle with the control turned to maximum dark. This brand new toaster is no better.
1,Garbage. look elsewhere,"We got this in the spring of last year, based on the strength of the reviews. It has already failed. Whatever mechanism is designed to hold the toast down no longer does so. We can merrily clamp it down manually, but that's not really too fun."
1,Low quality for a low price,"We wanted an inexpensive toaster that made evenly toasted toast.This toaster made reasonably even toast and had a great price, but shorted out recently and hasn't worked well since (the toasting lever doesn't work properly). Since that's after six months of slightly less than daily service, I couldn't possibly recommend this toaster to anyone."
4,nice for price,This is a nice little toaster for the price. It's a little flimsy and would not recommend if you want one that will last awhile.
1,junk,a piece of junk! you have to unplug the toaster to getthe toast to pop-up. certainly not a quality product
2,"Basic, crappy toaster",Flimsy plastic thing survived a little less than a year of typical undemanding toaster use. If you can find something cheaper you may as well buy it.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this toaster for $22 total in October 2009. It required flipping to toast evenly, and the cord was awkward, coming out of the front end, and short, and the sides got kinda hot, and... it broke! Until I get a replacement, I can only toast by holding the lever down manually. I got a little more than 2 1/2 years out of it. That's planned obsolescence for you."
1,Cord in Front,I wanted a cheap reliable toaster. This one has 2 major drawbacks: (1) The cord comes off the front left corner. Why would anyone want a toaster with a cord in the front instead of the back? (2) It doesn't toast evenly. For me those two thinks make it an unacceptable product.
2,Doesn't Pop up easily,The toaster's only down side is that if you want to stop it toasting you can't get the lever to come up. You have to unplug the toaster and than it pops up.
5,GREAT,"I bought this for my sister, and she LOVES it. Great price! Great quality! I would recommend this particular toaster to anyone."
1,Horrible!,"Barely worked, came damaged, broke easily, waste of money. And it's impossible to return for money back. pfft! peice of crap"
1,Todays concept seller,"I ordered this item on Jan 4 2011 and till date(Jan 18) they did not even start to ship my order after sendig a enquiry mail to the seller he responds saying "" your item is in backorder for another week time would you like to cancel the order?""..very dissapoited."
1,Worst toaster I've ever owned,"I cannot believe the folks who gave this a high rating. This is the worst toaster I've ever owned. The biggest complaint is that it toasts very unevenly. It tends to scorch the outside tops and leave the inside bottoms undone. You also have to decrease the setting for subsequent toast or you'll burn it. The down latch mechanism tends to no latch after getting jammed with crumbs, requiring you to clean out the toaster before you can use it again. Once the lever is pushed down it is impossible to raise up again; you have to wait for it to release by itself. The too-short power cord stupidly exits from the control side. The adjustment knob has little friction and is easy to knock to the maximum setting. The toaster housing gets REALLY hot.I'm disappointed with Proctor-Silex for marketing this piece of crap. I'll avoid the brand in the future. I'm extremely disappointed with Consumer Reports for giving this their Best Buy recommendation. I won't be renewing my subscription."
3,It works fine for me.,"I bought this one for my own use because I cannot share a toaster with other family members. I use it for toasting Gluten Free bread and it works fine for that. I do find that with Udi's bread, if it's dried out a bit I have to push the button down for a bit more browning and then have to unplug it mid-stream to keep the bread from getting too brown.I'm satisfied with it. And it's find for this price!"
3,Its hard to find a decent small toaster.,"Need a small, relatively durable toaster? Well they are hard to find. Supersized America has entered the kitchen.I have had this toaster for a number of years and it keeps on toasting. IT WAS A SUPER DEAL, UNDER TEN BUCKS AT WALGREENS. I understand the criticism regarding no button to pop toast early and honestly, had I known this, I might not have bought it. Easy solution: plug it into a switchable socket (or get a socket switch adapter for a couple of bucks). These counter appliances are usually positioned right next to the power source.I mean, lets face it, massive ""designer toasters"" were created for a consumer culture which had lost its sense of priorities many years ago."
1,Broke after using it twice,Slide wouldn't stay down. Proctor Silex's return policy is from the dark ages. Don't buy Proctor Silex.
1,Barely acceptable,"It toasts VERY slowly, and the results are slightly uneven and inconsistent. Dense bread that's stored in the fridge (like bagels) barely brown on the highest setting. I wish I had returned this before the 30 days expired."
5,"Excellent value, very happy with it.","Toasts quickly. It's a big time saver compared to my over-sized, clunky toaster oven I was using before. The slats in the toaster aren't really big enough for super-thick bagel-store bagels (the ones from NY area), but ok for thinner ones, like ones from the supermarket. Perfect for toast or english muffins. Cord is short, but they usually are on all these toasters. I recommend it!!"
5,Great Electro PowerPop,"Surprising debut of this band.Remastered por Simon Davey (Bjork, Depeche Mode...) , this CD invites you to a party where the B52s meet Basement Jaxx while the dancefloor goes to hell with a smile.Waiting to be discovered."
1,What a waste of money,"This item is described as being two pages, yet it is in fact less than 500 words long. None of the information is very useful or interesting."
4,Gems like this are what keeps a horror fan captivated...,"Best movie since Inside this year. I have to say I was thuroughly impressed with this beauty. Having some tremendous allusions to such films as The Shining, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This will surprise even the most critical horror officionados. Thank you, Lars E. Jacobson & Amardeep Kaleka, for a wonderful film."
4,Another Hard To Find Title,Tough one to find and it really is a shocking and interesting story. Watch this one with your friends and fam and watch them squirm...Really tense and if you can just look past the slightly lower quality to the film it really is one to add to the collection. A little far fetched of course but still based on a very real issue...
1,Andrea Yates Heads to the Country,"This psychological drama has a paper thin plot, one dimensional script, and has been falsely advertised as a horror movie. The excellent cinematography and strong performance from the young lead actor cannot save this snooze fest."
4,Completely disturbing....yet I can't stop watchin....,"This film was loosely based on the actual events revolving around Andrea Yates, who drowned her four children. I must warn that this film isn't for everyone, children are ruthlessy hunted down and murdered, thus for obvious reasons some viewers may wish to avoid watching this. Overall, this was a great horror/thriller film, it thoroughly disturbs. I must admit that even though I am a horror movie fanatic, I was even a bit squimish and disgusted by what I saw, but I was so fascinated and caught up in the film that I couldn't stop watching it. If you think you can handle watching a film of this nature, then I would reccomend it."
5,Baby Blues,One of the most original horror movies to come down the pike in a long time. Original and scary with lots of action and scares along the way. To watch this mom attack her children in such a brutal way is outrageous. I was shocked and glad at the same time. Not since the 80's have I seen a film with such a nasty and evil aura. To think a director would take on this subject matter and make it work as a film is amazing. This is a keeper for horror fans. I watched it 3 times now and can't believe what I am watching. I still can't get it out of my head. PostPartum depression Moms are real scary. Thank you for this film. Thanks for the originality and creepiness and downright disturbing material. This could be your neighbor. 4 STARS.
4,Disturbing!,"One reviewer stated that this isn't a horror film.. it has me wondering what could be more horrible than a mother stabbing and hacking up her children and farm animals? Anyway, I found the lead actress to be very convincing and even frightening. The oldest son was good as well. I like the country setting and scenery it really gives a sense of isolation. This straight to dvd ""horror"" film was so much better than the recent slate of theatrical horror films of the past few years. Parents of younger children may want to stay clear of this one due to the child abuse and child death content. Enjoy."
2,Baby Blues,"I really didn't care for this movie much. I like thrillers, and horror movies, but didn't like this one for some reason."
4,corded self feed screw shooter,"I read a bunch of review on the quick drive screw shooter and they seemed to be either a love or hate situation I opted to go with senco as their other tools perform well. We are currently building a 8500 sf custom home in conifer colorado. The wind is something terrible and caused delays by blowing braced walls out of plumb etc. The point is, this thing rocks. It put us back on schedule in 1/2 day of use. The only downside is that it seems to cook tips on the square drive screws... I can't comment on dry wall application yet. Well worth the money for any crew size from one to five on up i would suppose."
2,words but not the music,"I own just one hardback volume of this collection, so when I saw the complete collection in paperback, I ordered it. Anyone interested in folk music knows how important it is. But while the hardback copy has the music, the paperback does not. I would not have bought it,if I had known this. This is one of the perils of buying over the internet. So if you only want the words, by all means buy it. But if you want the music, and these are ballads after all, save up for the hardbacks."
3,Nice but bland.,"Not bad-tasting at all, but not a very defined taste, rather muted in fact. If you like sparkling drinks rather than true carbonation, this one's for you."
1,Disappointing,The product that is sent does not match the track listing as seen here. The CD I received only had four tracks. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
2,Too hard to read,"If small and portable is your only concern, then take a flashlight with you so you can read the LED in restaurant lighting. I fault myself for purchasing something way too small for my purpose. I'm weighing small food portions, not gold dust."
5,Perfect,"It works great. I carry it around with me and often forget that I have it, but when I do, I use it."
3,OK,Thought of returning it when I saw it...battery did not go in/stay in well...seems to be cheap quality. But I used it and it works for what I need it to do.
3,It's decent,"It's precise to within .1 grams, but it's certainly not that accurate. If you turn the scale off and back on, you're probably going to get a reading that's as much as half a gram different from the last. Why don't they make these things work off solar power? I hate dealing with batteries, and the little ones are the worst.Not a bad scale, but not a good scale either."
1,polder scale is awful in many ways,"Besides the aforementioned fact that POLDER WILL NOT HELP (after many emails I even sent one that just said ""WILL YOU AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE RECEIVING MY EMAILS???"" They did not) everything about this scale sucks. The craftsmanship is garbage, the little plastic things that make the tray sit evenly fell off in about 2 weeks, and the case doesn't fit that well on the scale. In addition, this thing drained FIVE sets of batteries in the span of 2 weeks. Now I have a scale that doesn't do anything but make me mad. When it (briefly) worked, it seemed to weigh fine. Everything else has been a major disappointment, and now i have to shop for a new scale. DONT BUY, UNFORTUNATELY I LISTENED TO THE POSITIVE REVIEWS, WHEN I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THAT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR."
2,power problem,"The scale itself is accurate, but it seems to drain the battery even when it's off. I keep having to take them out in order to save the battery life."
5,Meets expectations,Great product! Perfect size and very convenient to use. I would definitely recommend.
5,Love This Product,"I purchased the Polder Pocket Sized Digital Scale, because I was on a diet and needed to measure out my food. I was going on vacation and needed to have a scale. This scale is so convenient and it is small enough to pack in your purse or backpack. It is very accurate and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,Polder Pocket Size Digital Scale,"The scale itself is good - I've used one before, which is why I purchased it. However, the enclosed batteries were low/didn't work, on either of the two Polder scales that I purchased - not good."
4,When you need to weigh very small amounts (<1 lb.),"A nice little product, well designed. You can put a container on first, reset to zero, then add content to the container and get weight only for the contents and not the container. Cool. It's attractive, too, and I think it's fairly priced.*The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the little moon-shaped pads, in the lid that doubles as a tray for weighing, came off immediately because they were not securely glued on. I can re-glue them so it's not a big problem and certainly doesn't interfere with the functioning of the scale, but it demotes the product by one star. 8=)"
4,Works great but...,"Purchased this pocket scale to take to my boyfriend's house so we could measure out our food. We used it once, and went to use it again a few days later and it wouldn't turn on! It seems that if you leave the batteries in the scale, they drain rather quickly. We avoid this by taking one of the batteries out when we aren't using it, and we've been using the same ones for a couple months now. This is a great scale, though, with the option to weigh in grams or ounces with a tare feature. Takes care of all our weighing needs!"
4,The artist is...,"The artist for this album is Princes of Dahomey. I looked it up on www.gracenote.comGood album, great percussion and crossover of instrumentation and evolutionary styles."
4,NO FRILLS,"I AM A SPANISH STUDENT WHO FINDS THIS SERIES HELPFULL. I PUT IT ON WHEN I AM TIRED OR EATING MY LUNCH. I REVIEW VERBS AND VOCABULARY IN A RELAXING WAY. I STUDY FROM MY TEXTBOOK, WATCH SPANISH MOVIES, SPEAK WITH MY NEIGHBORS WHEN I CAN. VARIED INPUT WORKS BEST FOR ME. I FIND THIS SERIES USEFUL FOR REVIEW. IT WORKS BETTER THAN THE STANDARD DEVIANTS. HOW MANY TIMES CAN I REVIEW WITH THAT?"
2,consistantly taking them but have yet to feel any different,"i personally started taking them to boost energy as i found that's what this herb can do. i don't feel it working. from what i read about ginseng, you should start feeling something by 2nd week, its now 2nd month and nothing. it could just be me."
5,Perfect. Works great.,It is a perfect replacement part. It fits just right and does exactly what it is supposed to do. It will be important to find out how long it works.
5,cheap replacement easy install,"i ordered these to replace the worn out shocks in a tahoe in which the backdoor no longer stayed open on its own anymore, the install was very simple there are videos online that show in detail how to do it you only need a screw driver to replace them and these work the same as the factory ones, only time will tell if they will last longer than the oem ones"
1,Never buy a Mustek,"Please never buy a Mustek product. I bought one and I am still regretting till date why I did it. I couldn't even get to take one picture. The Camera keeps freezing, and I was not even able to get bright picture each time I used. Please get something else. A word to a wise is sufficient."
4,Quick Read,"THis book read surprisingly quickly. There were really no dull moments, except the chapters that dealt with specific football games. Thankfully, that was few. A lot of questions were left unanswered, but I especially enjoyed his take and opinion of other Cowboys."
4,Sexiest man on earth!,"As a fellow islander AND a fellow Arabesque romance writer, I have to say I was delighted by Marcia King-Gamble's depiction of the small Caribbean island where Under Your Spell is set. Although in her novel, the island is fictitious, it is based on an island that really exists. I recognised it at once for the beautiful sun-drenched island that it is... a place where I myself fell in love years ago.Her suspense-filled story of obeah in the islands was equally authentic, as were her rich and wonderful island characters.And as for Dane, her dreadlocked leading man, let me tell you something, girls...he is the sexiest man on earth!"
5,Kind of a Mystery,"This book was fast and easy reading, and very romantic. I loved the way Gamble mixed the history of the island culture and its people into a romance novel that was not too far from reality. Even though the end was predictable, the story leading up the ending was adventurous!"
4,"MYSTERIOUS, ROMANTIC","UNDER YOUR SPELL, the Island setting, the mystical powers surrounding Island, the intrigue of the male character, the romance, what more could a reader ask for, Ms. Gamble did an excellent job intermixing the mystic powers, mystery, and romance, giving you a triple dose of excitement. Best Wishes!Betty"
4,Stories Needing to be Told,"As a Southerner ""of a certain age"" whose family always had a ""retainer"" who functioned as a nanny and cook and laundress and therapist six days a week, devoting herself to our needs rather than her own, being paid inadequately without healthcare and a retirement plan, these retainers seldom being known by their last names, I celebrate Emily Wilson's giving these women a voice, for without them Southern families could not have functioned with grace. Thank you, Emily."
3,The Nitty Gritty,"I bought these because for some odd reason, Sugar free Orange in the two quart Mix is just about impossible to find, especially in local grocery stores. I've used about 10 of the two quart envelopes, and while they taste about like Crystal Light ---Here's the but --- EVERY mixed 2-quart portioseems to end with a powdery and gritty sediment at the bottom of the Pitcher. Doesn't matter how hard I mix it, it's still the same griitty residue at the last glass.I bought the 12 can pack, but after I drink down the last few cans, I hope I can find Crystal Light again or something BETTER.Theis stuff is definitly NOT good to the last cup"
4,Battery purchase,"The CR1/3N battery shipped quickly, no problems. But the postage was so expensive I did not save any money."
4,Collated framing nails,"For the DIY homeowner, who owns a power framing nailer , it's difficult to find compatable collated nails , in reasonable quantities , at local building suppy stores. Most stores only stock limited nail types, and usually in large quantities ( 10,000+ nail/ boxes ). Thru Amazon , I was able to purchase the relatively small quantity (500 ) of the specific type of nails I needed , at a reasonable price. The free shipping feature made the cost comparable to what I would have had to pay at the so called "" Discount Building Supply Chains ""-- and I didn't have to buy a lifetime supply size quanity. Amazon had a tremendous amount of ; sizes, types ,and quantities available--with excellent product descriptions."
2,Poor packaging,Shipped two boxes of nails in small box with little or no padding. Shipped them US parcel post. Most nails we broken. Better of buying them local at lowes
3,Disappointed,"While I can't disagree about the quality of these nails, I am disappointed in the cost, considering the small quantity. Locally, 2500 nails cost about $30.00 to $40.00; for less than $10.00, these would be worth trying. These would be better offered as a ""sample pack"" for a lower price.I had to add $14.00 for shipping, making the cost not worth it (I wish Amazon would offer more shipping options, beside UPS)."
3,Not for tea-cuop dog,Wanted a toy for my tea-cup yorkie and it's way too big. Suitable for 10+ lbs dog.
1,Totally unacceptable.,"In a period of less than 10 minutes following receipt of toy,our ten-pound Boston Terrier had torn cover on and was shreddingcenter ball such that item was no longer usable.An absolute waste!"
2,Fun but doesn't last long,"My dog really enjoyed this product, but she managed to remove the small tennis ball in the first couple hours of having the toy and proceeded to shred the small tennis ball to pieces. Now she's working on shredding the fabric, but at least she's enjoying it."
1,Dog VERY Sick from this toy!,"I gave this toy to my dog at noon today. When I came home at 5:30, he had eaten 2/3 of the ""tennis ball."" He has been throwing up pieces of rubber and is now becoming lethargic. I just came online to see if I could find out anything about the toxicity of this product. I am now taking him to the emergency vet clinic. My dog is small (a pekingese/pomeranian). He should not have been able to eat this toy in a matter of hours. YIKES!!! Don't buy!!!"
3,Sabbath's first mediocre album.,"Seventh Star is the first Sabbath album that is average. The album was originally planned as a solo album by guitarist Tony Iommi, but somehow, it was named a Sabbath album. Iommi is the only original member on this record. Glenn Hughes does vocals pretty good, but is no Dio or Osbourne. Some tracks are great like the opening ""In for the Kill"" and ""Turn to Stone"" while others like ""Heart Like a Wheel"" and the title track are rather bland. The whole album is power metal and is a far cry from their '70s period, but Seventh Star is simply mediocre."
3,Hit-or-Miss for Tony Iommi,"Long before I knew that ""Seventh Star"" was intended to be Tony Iommi solo record, the album cover said so.The billing is: ""Black Sabbath Featuring Tony Iommi."" The album's cover doesn't have the usual foreboding Black Sabbath art. Just a photo of Tony Iommi in the desert, looking like the classic loner.If you ask me, it certainly works as a Tony Iommi solo album, but not necessarily a Black Sabbath album.That's not to say it's a bad record. If you're a fan of Tony Iommi's riffs, soloing and technique you will like it. The musicians backing Iommi up are, of course, very good. The record definitely has some shining moments -- ""No Stranger to Love"", ""Danger Zone"" and ""Seventh Star"" are personal favorites.How often you're going to listen to ""Seventh Star"" is another story."
5,Excellent,"Glenn Hughes himself was not in a nice phase of his life during and after the recording of this album. However, the songs are great, Hughes sing like few others can do and Iommi shows his virtuosism trough his heavy riffs, supported by a nice band. A must have for hard rockers."
3,Forgettable,"Things had gotten pretty bad for Black Sabbath by this point. Of course, this isn't a Sabbath album; rather, it's an Iommi solo project that had ""Black Sabbath"" slapped on the cover to boost sales. Now, Tony is a metal god. No bad album can touch his status. But you've got to expect more from him than this. Seventh Star comes across as more reminiscent of Journey than of Sabbath. Oh, it has it's moments. Take it as something other than Sabbath, and you'll likely find it much more satisfactory than if you think of it as a part of the Sabbath catalog."
2,Is it even Sabbath?,"I give Iommi credit for sticking with it after everyone ditched, but considering everybody else on this album is Whitesnake alumni, it just doesn't have a sabbath sound to it. Not the writing, the tone or even the guitars. Very weak. It disappointed me when it came out and I still try to listen to it every few years and I can never get throught it without skipping.Iff you want some non-Ozzy Sabbath, get Born again, Mob Rules or Heaven and Hell...or even anything after Eternal Idol. This is the weakest Sabbath album ever, only barely worse than Eternal Idol. Just pretend it never happened."
2,More Like Iommi Solo,"I totally hated this album when it was first released, but have warmed up to some of it over the years. I think Tony Iommi wanted to bill this as a solo effort instead of a Sabbath release(he was all that was left of the band at this point)but Warner Brothers wouldn't go for it. A lot of it doesn't feel like a Sabbath album; it's an attempt to be way too commercial. Glenn Hughes is okay here;I really liked him as a member of Deep Purple. I will say that Seventh Star sounds a little more polished than the Born Again fiasco with Gillan."
4,This is a good album,"Seventh Star is in the category of 'forgotten' Sabbath albums that include 'Born Again' and 'Never Say Die'. This album features Glenn Hueghs on vocals, Eric Singer( later with KISS) on drums, Eddie'Spitz' on bass, and of course Toni Iommi on guitar. Geoff Nichols the fifth member of Sabbath rounds out this album with keyboards. You'll be hard pressed to find better musician ship from Toni. He gets away from his bar chord riffs like Iron Man and War Pigs and really lets loose. 'Turn to Stone' is a good example of this. The title track 'Seventh Star' takes you on a trip to God knows where. It's really out there. Glenn sounds good on the album, but unfortunatly, the lyrics are sometimes weak. I always liked the chorus for 'Angry Heart' though. I'll put this album against anything put out by the on again off again Tony Martin era."
2,"""I Got the Funk..........I Got the Funk.........la la...""","There's really only one way to desribe this album: funkalicious. With Hughes at the helm, the band finally sank into a blues-funk stupor, spawning uninspiring songs and unmemorable riffs. Hughes isn't a bad singer, but he has no business singing for Black Sabbath. This is probably the release with the heaviest ""huh?"" factor of all the Sab albums. Buy this one only if you love funk and you feel like making a mockery of the Sabbath name."
5,BLACK SABBATH AT THIER FINEST!!!,"THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SABBATH FAN.TONI IOMMI HAS A WAY OF MAKING MUSIC SOUND SO BEAUTIFUL,AND YET RIP YOUR GUTS OUT WITH HIS GUITAR RIFFS.WITH TONI ON GUITAR,AND GLENN HUGHES ON VOCALS,THEY CREATED A MASTERPIECE.DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND PICK THIS UP.YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!"
1,Glenn...please stop!,"I've been listening to Black Sabbath for well over 20 years; they are my all-time favorite band. I love all the eras, Ozzy, Dio, Tony Martin and the one album with Gillan. I tried so hard to like Seventh Star but I just cannot do it. Iommi sounds good but it's not his best work. And Glenn Hughes sounds just god awful on this record. I can't listen to it all the way through without cringing to his lame vocals. I don't think there is one song on here I enjoy listening to. This is not a Black Sabbath album and it was never intended to be one either. I cannot believe the record company talked Iommi into putting the Black Sabbath name on the cover...I don't get it. I just thank the lord things did not work out with Hughes and Iommi back in the 80's it could have been disastrous. The recent stuff like the Dep Sessions and Fused is not very good either. Again, Iommi is the man but I cannot listen to Glenn Hughes vocals over his riffs...it don't sound right."
4,All you ever wanted to know..,"About duplicate bridge. Absolutely everything, but with small type and some repteitions it is not so easy to flip through."
2,Poorly Written,"I sent the publisher a letter stating over 30 mispellings, and 15+ times in which this book conflicted itself seriously. Not a good book to use. Get Brady's Emergency Care - Much better."
5,Very good!,The show is insanely good and should be watched by any fan of anime. One of the better mech shows.
2,"Good songs poorly collated, audio indifferent","Hardly one of these songs is well recorded. Many have the ending sharply cut. As a matter of taste, the pairing with Sonny Terry is not a success."
5,Very Good,Excellent recording quality. I had this album as an old LP years ago and this CD brings back lots of good memories.
3,Pleasant European style,A selection of tangos played in a sugary European style - not your raw passionate Argentine stuff. Very pleasant for listening or dancing. Tracks 2 and 6 are not what they say on the sleeve but are both Albeniz' tango. Track 8 is La Paloma.
3,Looks Like Original,I bought this because a truck had side swiped my caravan so i needed a new mirror this is an exactly looking replica to the mirror i had on the minivan..the power movements work like a charm its the hinge on the mirror itself i dont like it is too flimsy.. the original mirror i could fold in with one finger this one i have to use 2 hands just so i can fold it in a straight as possible without distorting the hinge...
1,Not a woodworker's tool....,"I bought the Stanley SB2IN1 in early January because it could shoot both brads down to 5/8"" and staple, giving me more versatility in my shop. Hindsight being 20/20, I wish I would have spent the extra money up front for a good stapler and a good brad nailer. The cylinder wouldn't seal when you hooked it up to an air hose, and I would have to continually hook it up/disconnect it until it would finally seal. The other problem, and it might be related, is that even when I put the compressor at the max pressure (100psi) it wouldn't countersink staples even in 1/2"" plywood. The last problem is that if you could get it to countersink a brad, the footprint is the size of a staple. Leaving an ugly mark on your project. I returned the tool and am ordering a separate stapler and brad nailer."
2,badly executed design,"This is a lightweight nailer/stapler that can handle narrow staples and light gauge brads of up to 2 inches.I have not used this tool much but about a third of my time so far has been spent fixing jams and the loading assembly. The loading magazine spring popped out, the magazine does not secure positively and it jams from time to time.This is the worst Stanley branded tool I own. Looking for a replacement."
4,Light weight dual purpose,"I use this mostly for stapling up cedar shingles and the only problem I have with it is you have to pull the trigger every time. I understand this is considered a finish nailer but having an option would be nice, especially in a situation like mine where accurancy is much less important than speed.The plastic nose guard didn't last long on mine for siding work, but when I'm doing finish work I always get it out. The arrows are very accurate in helping show the nail/staple position.Bositch now makes an even lighter model but that one is for staples only. Having the ability to do staples and brads is why I keep getting this one. Plus the weight difference doesn't really matter to me because this on is already so light I don't notice the weight."
1,Not worth a dime!!,"I'm a woodworker ,I bought this tool thinking a dual use tool would be more practical. Was I wrong!I've had this tool about 2 months and used it to drive 3 18 gauge nails ,it promptly jambed up and wouldn't shoot another nail. It will shoot staples very well, but due to the sloppy slot the nails slide in, they become jambed right away.What lousey workmanship .I have a 16 Ga. Porter Cable nailer that is indestructable.I've had it 5 yrs.and use it constantly and have had no problems with it. This Bostitch tool is totally worthless . I would recomend it for the junk pile"
1,I won't buy another one,"This came with my compressor and I thought it was a good idea, two tools in one. I used it to finish a book case using the brads and it worked well. I later used the stapler with 3/4 inch staples and after using half the day it would not work. I would expect a tool to last much longer. Unfortunately I have had it beyond the warranty time and can't get it replaced."
2,Difficult puzzle for toddlers,"The concept of this puzzle is great. However, the puzzle itself is very difficult to put together. The drawings on each layer are intricate and very close in color. My husband and I and other family members have a tough time with it, never mind my toddler. May not be good for a child without a good attention span/patience."
4,Excellent learning tool,I am a Montessori teacher in a 3-6 year old classroom. We studied the life cycle of butterflies this spring. We just released the butterflies that the children watched morph from caterpillar to butterfly. This puzzle was an excellent companion activity. The children choose this work (still) over and over again.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"Bravo to Mrs. Chavez for writing this incredibly personal story.I feel like I know the characters, and my heart goes out to each one of them. The author's attempt at reaching her sister in the Concerned Christians cult through every possible medium (i.e. this book) is a true statement of her love and her dedication to her sister Jan and Jan's daughter (Nicolette) who was left behind by the cult to fend for herself.This book will tear at your heartstrings. It will make you smile. It will make you angry. It will make you cry. But most of all it will make you (as it made me) understand how easy it is to take precious memories and relationships for granted. The media coverage is gone, but the suffering of the families continues now, and will continue until the day their families are reunited. Now, they are only able to remember their past experiences, and I thank Mrs. Chavez for allowing me to share in those memories."
5,extraordinary touching and full of quiet wisdom,"This book is one of the most moving and brilliantly written memoirs I have read in several years. The story perspective and the passion the author's words are a testiment to her sisterly love and devotion. Having just lost my brother to cancer, I deeply feel Betty's emotional quest to reach her sister. I pray that Betty's search for her sister will have a happy ending. I wish her the very best. Losing someone you love is hard. God Bless"
5,A review from your niece,"I'm so glad that Betty wrote this book in memory of Grandma and Aunt Nancy. I know all of us hope to find Aunt Jan and Uncle John and reunite with them. Even to those who are not family will enjoy this book because it tells of the struggles and the simple clues of suspecting a cult. To Betty, I love you and miss you and hope to see you sometime soon.Love and best wishes,Kari Redman"
1,to someone out there,Well I just finished this book and I must say it was truly a eye opener. How sad that Betty could'nt just love Jan and John uncondtionally..... It seems that the book was written in a angry spirit. It was interesting to see how the lives of all these people can be so night and day.....Maybe Betty should have had more Grace on her sister then anger.. If she truly belived in the doctrine she preaches in the book then she would know that Loving her enemies and having Grace would have accomplished more good then bad. Sorry but this book does not speak truth regarding CC.
4,Good stuff,"Would give it 5 stars but not ALL of my fish love it. The ones that do go mad for it when they see it (a majority of the breeds I raise) some just take it like any other food, others just peck at it and some don't even pay attention to it(particularly my cory's and pleccos). I think this is advertised as ""semi-floating"" or something like that and it is. If the water surface is calm and still it will float longer, but if there's any motion or turbulance on the surface, it will pretty much sink immediately. I purchased this because of the varied blend of ingredients in it, gotta be good for the fishes diet right? Can't say it brought any kind of ""ah-ha"" change to life in my tanks, but most of my fishes were really healthy to begin with. I purchased this food quite some time ago and am surprised to see how a ""lil' goes a long way"" it's true, this food seems expensive, but it goes a long way compared to flake food. The tiny little pellets seem to be more filling for my fishes."
1,None review,"I did not buy really this book, so I can not make any review. I received a book in English when I wanted a book in Spanish."
2,playback--but not the one by Chandler,"In order to dream, only a little sleep is requiedd--in other words, a nap. And that is what ""Perchance to Dream"" most resembles. Too bad Parker decided not to do any more Marlowe. I have a great idea for him: how about ""The Lady in the California Aqueduct""?t Too obviously written while watching a ""Chinatown"" rerun. When you use another author's style, it's called homage, when you use another author's characters, it's called fanfiction (albeit authorized fanfiction), but when you borrow style, characters, and plot, it's called larceny. I expected better from Parker. He should be punished by making him watch Elliot Gould's version of ""The Long Goodbye""."
3,"Good, but not best, by Parker...","If you know have ever read a book by R.B. Parker you will find yourself in a familiar environment in this book. Parker sets himself a brave task in writing a sequel to Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"" and succeeds in pulling it off superbly. Parker is one of the rare modern writers who still believe that characters can have principles, and live by them even in extreme circumstances. Although this is not Parker's best work, I still recommend this book in which, in my opinion, Parker surpasses one of the legends of detective fition, Raymond Chandler."
2,Missing in Action,"How any book claiming to cover woodcut prints could fail to mention the works of Antonio Frasconi and Leonard Baskin, yet show half-baked attempts at wood engraving, or champion Barry Moser's soul-less technique as ""mastery"" is fundamentally lacking. While I thought the love of the medium did show through, and the coverage of the tools and techniques was sound, I think many lesser artists were mentioned, and without these two, it yields an anemic visual source for the interested artist."
5,Must Have,This book is fantastic. Anyone with any interest in learning to carve using wood block or eraser block or linoleum must study this book. Your level of talent is almost immaterial if you have the desire to carve and a copy of this book!!
4,Exactly what is should be...,"Thank you Mr. Walker.I'd have given 4-1/2 stars if possible. This book is exactly as advertised by it's title. Very readable and concise with clear illustrations. Understanding that this book is not a pretentious compendium of the entire history of woodcuts will increase your appreciation of what is presented. I have 30-years experience in printmaking, and found this book well worth the read."
4,Very detailed information,"I bought this book to expand my knowledge of woodcut relief printmaking. Although it is very informative in the processes and techniques its focus is heavy on wood engraving. I was not expecting that. It does differentiate in the various relief processes such as linoleum, (which is not wood as in the title) wood, and newer materials that supplement use of wood such as resingrave a plastic matrix for engraving.A very thorough explanation of method, process and tools. great for the individual that wants a know how of this medium with good illustrations and descriptions. Heavy on text, a good book to refer to for ""how to""Suitable for college students and adults interested in this medium."
3,Run-of-the-Mill Murder Mystery,"Ms. Truman has had a long run of Capital Crime Mysteries now and honestly, I can't really find anything ""wrong"" with this one. It just didn't seem to have the pizazz of others in the series, even though we see the same protagonist. Mystery lovers will enjoy this book even though it seemed like some plot elements were after-thoughts. A bit too predictable, also, as I had figured out the murderer about 1/3 of the way in to it. Better than having nothing to read though, I suppose."
2,Disappointed,I would not recommend these for anyone with AMD. They might be OK for someone with normal vision but not for use with peripheral vision.
5,Right on the money! This is worth your money if you want pass the CLEP for PSYCH,"I bought this book after I read the reviews on Amazon. I needed to take the Intro Psych CLEP a prerequisite. I spent 2 weeks reading the book on my way to work on the train, took the 2 practice tests and felt ready for the test. I registered for the test last tuesday (2-17-2009)to take the test on Saturday (2-21-2009). I scored 76 out of 80 on the test. Remember, you need 50 to pass.In short this book is awesome! I will recommend this book. If you're very new to psychology, I will recommend you get a copy of 'How to Prepare for the AP Psychology with CD-ROM (Barron's AP Psychology Exam (W/CD)) (Paperback)'. This is very elaborative and has about 400 practice questions.This will help cement a lot of Psychology concepts down and guarantee you a near perfect score.I love you all and wish great success on your exams. Good luck."
1,i WISH THEY DIDNT MAKE MY TIME WATING ON THE BOOK AND NEVER GOT IT!!!,"I READ MANY GREAT REVIEWS ABOUT THE BOOK BUT NEVER GOT FROM ""BETTERWORLDS...i AM SO DISSAPPOINTED AS THEY MADE ME WASTE MY TIME WATING FOR THE BOOK AND NOTHING."
4,Accurate representation of clep test,"The writers of this book have an uncanny knowledge of the test because they obviously trim out most of psychology (to fit it into 100 quick pages) yet they seemed to hit most of the topics actually tested.Having some experience in neuroscience and psychiatry, I studied about 4 hours and scored 76. All I did was read through once and take 1 practice test. For those not familiar with the clep scoring, it's 20-80, with 50 being a ""pass"" I believe."
2,Almost worth it for the price,"I'll be honest, the only we used out of this was the KY lub. and that was the main purpose of the purchase anyways. The cheapest we found the KY was around $16, so this $20 pack is practically worth it with the other items, even if the mini massager is just used on sore feet. However, with that in mind the KY, so far, has really been only better than regular lub. for her and it doesn't seem to keep the 'lub-ness' as long as regular lub. either. This would have got 3 stars if the lub. was better, but the rest of the pack is 'take it or leave it' sort of things, we simply never used them. If you're looking for something new, lub. or otherwise, this is a good little pack to check out and cheap enough to do so. However if you just want some new/different lub. find the KY elsewhere, cheaper."
3,Worthwhile addition to the health library,"Jethro Kloss, was a follower of Dr. Kellog (of Battle Creek Sanitarium) and also Ellen G. White, the Seventh Day Adventist's prophetess (who plagiarized most of her books). He cites them both in the book. The information is good, even though some of the herbs are becoming hard to come by these days."
4,Old Time Health Guru's,Can't be to hard on old time health gurus. We have yet to prove that we will live longer then our grand-parents did.When I read about them I find that most came to their new way of life because of some very serious health problem when they were young. Their new life style cured them of their illness but damage had been done. It is my belief that even though they may be doing well the disease my have cause their lives to be shorten non- the -less.Because they changed their life style they may live better and longer then if they hadn't change at all.I think if you look to their children and grandchildern you might get a better understanding of whether or not what they preached is in fact any good. This of course assumes their children bought into their ideas from the start.Here it seems as if Promise Kloss Moffett outlived her father by some 17 years living to be 100 years old.
5,perfect condition,"Thank you, it arrived in perfect condition before it was scheduled to, thank you! The book was in superb shape, brand new it even had that new book smell, thanks again!"
5,Healthy Living,This book is a great resource for a healthy lifestyle. It provides information for understanding the importance of eating right and provides guidance for herbal remedies for health issues. I highly recommend this book to those who are interested in vegetarian lifestyle.
1,Just plain nuts,"Jethro is really a hilarious guy. Too bad he is actually serious about all the advice he gives. While it is interesting to read his thought on herbs very few of his ""cures"", many of which are for diseases that don't exist should ever be attempted. He is big on enemas and warns repeatedly about foods ""fermenting"" in the stomach. Even when this book was written it was know fermentation was a process whereby yeast turned sugars into alcohol. He makes many wild unsubstantiated claims such as Saffron cures measles and scarlet fever. He talks a lot about purifying the blood and avoiding ""poisonous"" foods. In his mind that is nothing from cancer to insanity that cannot be cured with herbs and correct diet."
1,Nonsense,"This book is nonsense. It is full of ""cures"" for diseases by different kinds of tea and other foolishness. If you are really sick, stay away from this."
5,Excellent Book,"I remember when I first bought read this book about 20 years ago and was struck by the passion and dedication to healing by the author first, and his extensive knowledge of herbal healing second. The book provides just about every form of internal and external healing advice and includes a recipe section as well. I have used many of the remedies mentioned in the book and have kept many afflictions at bay by using them as preventative measures over the years. I attribute my good health at 60 to the extensive use of herbs and plant foods mentioned in this book. I can't recommend this book highly enough for anyone seeking true enlightenment of natures cures and the virtues of eating plant foods. Jethro Kloss is the father of Herbal medicine and has to be one of the greatest healers of all time. Kudos to you my brother. I only wish I had met you in my lifetime."
4,Great! A classic guide for anyone's health library.,"This is an excellent book, simply written in layman terms.It was originally published in 1939 by the Author. It hasan easy-to-use, alphabetical format listing herbs, uses,ailments, causes, treatments etc.--has a good index.Includes diets for specific ailments. Excellence at anaffordable price."
3,Back to Eden,Great Book to have around the house. It has great natural herbal remedies that you can use for just about anything.
1,If I could give zero stars...,I bought this book ages ago at a respected health store. It looked like it covered a wide range of topics and would be handy to have as a reference. I think I paid $7.99 for it. I could have paid a quarter at a yard sale and still felt like I was gyped. The author must have been one of those skeevy televangelists because the entire tone of his work is biased and holier-than-thou in the sense that not a single word he wrote is based on any kind of proven fact. Please don't spend money on this book. There are so many other books out there that cover these subjects. Even the ones with recycled facts are still better than made up ones.
3,Informative,"Good information but I find many of the treatments brief or outdated, I prefer The Little Herb Encyclopedia by Jack Ritchason. Together they make the perfect herbal library."
5,Awesome Resource,"I have used this book for reference for many, many years. I also have the Back to Eden Cookbook. I reference this material, which is easy to read, concise and most helpful. This book has information A to Z regarding herbs, natural remedies, nutrition and more.....Very well researched, tested and proven many times over. This book is timeless! A must for your book shelf if you are interested in seeking improved health and wellness. It includes many illustrations, photographs, charts, glossaries, etc. You won't be disappointed! I have bought extra copies for some of my friends and family!"
5,Such a fun read!,Loved the book. Don't normally read fantasy genre but really got into the characters. Have recommended it to many.
4,Easy to read answers for parents,"I have done a ton of reading on ASDs since my son was diagnosed 2 years ago. I wish I had read this book two years ago! It is full of hope and sound advice based on research. I definitely came away feeling like I could use everyday, no cost experiences to teach my son and enrich his quality of life (which is very different from a lot of books out there that suggest expensive therapies, diets, supplements, etc. are the only way to help your child). The authors mix research with personal accounts which is very helpful. I would strongly recommend this book for any parent, childcare giver or person who is interested in helping a child with an ASD reach their potential. There is HOPE! YOU can make a difference in the life of the child you cherish. The challenges you see today, will not be here forever if you are willing to put in the hard work, perserverance, and most importantly love, needed to help. I would strongly recommend it!"
2,Poor Quality Control,Many of the nails were bent. It took me an hour to get the bent ones out. Very poor quality nails. I gave it two stars because the remaining nails did work in the Hitachi NR83A without any trouble. What make this so annoying is the extremely high price. I just ordered 3000 Hitachi nails of the same kind for only a little more. If you buy B&C nails you will lose time doing their quality assurance and pay a premium for it!!
2,Did not work in my nailer,"These nails did not work well in my Bostich F21PL framing nailer, even though that nailer was listed on the side of the box in the ""designed to work with..."" list.The plastic of the collation was so soft that it did not snap off like other nails I have used in the nailer. Instead, the plastic stayed together, forming a ""snake"" of spent plastic that gummed up the works. I suppose I could have pulled out the nails after each shot, trimmed the plastic, and reloaded. Since my project was done out on our ranch, far from big-box hardware stores, this failure created a significant inconvenience.Perhaps this lot was not properly manufactured, so yours might turn out better.The nails, on the other hand, were fine, so I give a couple stars for that. Only the collating plastic was a problem."
3,Grouchy Neighbors Liked Clifford After All,"I'm five years old. This is a really good book. I liked it when Clifford saved the bird, and when he got a hug from the grouchy neighbors. In the beginning, the grouchy neighbors had a sign that said no dogs allowed. They didn't like Clifford. Sometimes Clifford's hair went into the backyard of the neighbors. Clifford sang too loud. They said, ""Clifford, don't block the sun."" Clifford wished that the grouchy neighbors liked him as much as they liked the birds. One day, Clifford saw some guys putting new pipes in. He saw the cat trying to get the bird. He took a deep breath and sucked up the cat with a pipe. Then the grouchy neighbors ended up liking him after all. I liked it because it was a really good story."
5,Fun for kids,"This book lets kids talk about being grouchy and explore feelings other than the stress of always being happy. Great read- we might have read it about 1,000 times by now... Poor Clifford in the parking lot of the grocery store..."
3,Darn poor packing!!,"Can't seem to find a way to file a complaint so I will do this instead.The package arrived in a reasonable amount of time, however it was damaged in shipment due to poor packing. Placing a box of nails for a nail gun inside another larger box without any cushioning of any kind will only result in a whole bunch of loose nails. If I wanted loose nails I would have ordered them, instead somewhere between 5% and 10% of the strips of nails are broken and unusable in a nail gun.Short of that the order was correct, but I want to know what to do with the damaged portion. I don't have time to play with returning the whole thing or I would, so I guess I will be driving a couple hundred nails with an old fashion hammer. Thanks a lot!!"
2,Beautiful book with lots of problems,"It is a very visually pleasing book. However, there are a number of problems with the book.""Little Cow"" is referred to as ""he."" Cows are female. Bulls and steers are male. If the main character were ""Little Calf,"" it would be fine for the character to be a ""boy.""The book repeats refrain ""Did you moo?"" ""I don't moo..."" which is grammatically awkward. Other ""Who Says Moo"" books use the refrain, ""Someone said moo, what it you?"" ""I don't moo..."" which is less awkward.Some of the characters say ""I do not moo"" and other characters say ""I don't moo."" The lack of consistency makes it a little tougher to read the book.Our kids (one year old twins) really like the book. I wish I didn't have to remember to substitute ""she"" for ""he"" as I read the book."
4,CD of Irish Dance,"This is a great CD if you like traditional Irish music. If you are an Irish dancer, it provides songs with tempos that will help you pick up your speed. There is wonderful harmony in the beat and every song is an instant foot-tapper. There are no words in the entire album, just great instrumentals!"
4,"Great for Dance, but not so great to just listen to...","I am an Irish Dancer, and it is hard to find irish music that is good to practice to. I too am a huge fan of Celtic music, and i wouldn't pick this CD to just listen to, but for me it is great to practice to."
4,excellent critical thinking,"I don't know what ever compelled me to buy this book, I try to avoid anything Trek-y. However I took away a great exercise in critical thinking. The author effectively deconstructs certain myths (and proves others could be true) using fairly solid energy-physics arguments. The same reasoning could be ported to the alternative energy market and other fields. I recommend this especially to astrophysicists and people who like to analyze technological claims."
4,BEYOND BEAM ME UP SCOTTY........,"Author Laurence Krauss is Chairman of the Department of Physics at Case Western Reserve. He is also the author of several other books including THE PHYSICS OF STAR TREK. This book explores such topics as alien invasions, time travel, quantum reality and more in movies like X-Files, Star Wars, Indepedence Days and in other aspects of popular culture and life today. Divided into 15 chapters at 190 pages (including index) it's a fairly easy read or maybe you'd like to listen on the audio version from Amazon.It would have been great to include a glossary since those of us that don't have a physics graduate degree might enjoy glancing at that prior to reading the text. As science fiction quickly becomes science fact, this book belongs on any techie's shelf."
3,Advertises more than it delivers.,"This is a book about physics, and as such it's certainly entertaining and informative, if at times hard to fathom for certain people (such as myself). But I didn't necessarily buy it for the physics; I bought it to see how physics relates to Star Trek, The X-Files, and other shows, and there was not, in my opinion, nearly enough of that in this book. It went on for entire pages without mentioning any media connection at all. There are plenty of books for which that would not be a problem; a book that specifically advertises itself as media-related is not one of them. Still, it was interesting."
5,Delphi FD0009 Electric Fuel Pump,"This was the best deal anywhere.. Amazon saved me $50 bucks from the local parts house and $20 from Ebay. Not only that it was FREE shipping, packaged very well. The original box looked like it was just off the press did not appear to be sitting on the shelf some place for an extended amount of time and of-coarse the pump works very well."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!!!,"This is my first Venom CD and man was I blown away. I had heard some of their songs before but once I put Disc 1 of this CD I was blown away. This was total thrash metal with AWESOME lyrics! Venom came out in 1979 before thrash, death, and black metal existed and I truly believe that Venom influenced all 3 genres. The person that called this ""a poor man's slayer"" truly doesn't know what he's talking about. This band came out before Slayer, influenced Slayer and Slayer knows and pays tribute to this band all the time. Now, this may not be the most talented band of all time but this is just one of those CDS that when you put it in you are in another world and everything in my life is good. Also, it is 2 discs for only 15 bucks so it is well worth it. Buy today, or continue posing."
4,Very Good!,"As a sophmore i really liked the book Annabel. To me it was very interesting since i grew up and still do live on a farm. My family farm used to have pigs on it too. The book is a great book for children, it explains that being big isnt everything in life. Childhood is fun also. So i highly suggest that you read the book! ITS GREAT!!"
1,Un Periodico de Ayer.....,"Después de releer lo ya leído... tantas veces contado y recontado ... volvemos a tenerlo para reelerlo.... Este es el caso de esta novela ESTRECHO DE TRAICION. Y esta vez la misma historia nos llega de forma tan melosa y empalagosa que uno termina empalagado de tración, de fotografías antiguas, de fiestas, del guapetón malvado posando con insistencia, robando siempre camara y páginas, mientras la víctima dramatiza su vil destino. y la escritora, siempre, dando manotazos de ahogado, como balsero en el estrecho de la Florida, para salvar la historia tan pasada y enterrada, a punta de una prosa antigua y arcaica como las mismas fotografías desteñidas. A la Sra escritora, hay que darle algunos puntos, por haber invertido su tiempo, creando una arquitectura literaria tan barroca, a la victima, otros cuantos puntos, por victimizarse todavía más... y al guapetón le dieron el honor de dedicarle el libro."
2,""" Un Periodico de Ayer""","Según Milan Kundera, gran novelista y ensayista, una novela, SOLO debería existir, si es que tiene algo que contar. Esta novela o relato o confesión,o como quieran llamarla los entendidos en la materia, Estrecho de Traición, no es más que- Un Periodico de Ayer... como dice la canción. La escritora, relata las desventuras de la victima, mujer inocente engañada, martir, o como ella quiera autodescribirse, con una prosa melosa, empalagosa, salpicada de metáforas incoherentes, que en algunos momentos, hacen un climax por lo mal llevada. La protagonista ha echado a volar su album fotografíco dentro de la traición, lo que muchas veces, por no decir en todo momento, nos aleja de la mal llevada historia. Creo, sin duda alguna, que, tanto la escritora como la pobre víctima, sólo han conseguido hacerle un gran tributo al traicionero guapetón con este escrito bañado en fotografías."
3,video in great condition,this video arrived in a well kept case with the video in great condition. I can't wait to see this with the residents of the home I work at. I have one certain lady who keeps asking for the Hardy movies.
1,A really really BAD movie!,"I <3 Chris Sarandon so much! This movie though, was aweful...it does not hold ones interest in the least and the romance between Sarandon and Tenant does not work at all! Also, not a good horror flick in any sense...it was torture sitting through this one....If you <3 horror and Chris as well, go with Fright Night (1985)...this man smokes the screen in this movie and takes the lead Way over the top...."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,"I bought this movie and it was a waste of money. I'm serious. If your a Dean Koontz fan, stick with the books. His books are great but I seen some of his movies and they aren't so...um good."
4,Sophia Gold is to blame for my messy house,"Very few things cause me to forget my 'to do' list -- but this book did. The leaves piled up, dust bunnies roamed and dinner waited until I could finish the book to find out whodunnit."
4,Mystery Novel Novice,"Not having much experience or interest in suspense books, I throughly enjoyed this one. It kept me gripped and guessing all the way to the end, as well as up WAY past my bed time (and I am the mother of a 10 month old baby and desperately need my sleep!). Looking forward to Sophia Gold's future adventures."
4,Gripping!,I just finished this book and it was a great read. I was totally immersed in the characters and setting within 20 pages and then just didn't want to put it down! I am already anxiously awaiting the next installment in the Sophia Gold series!
2,Disapointed,Exhaust arrived and when opened I discovered the exhasut system was missing parts and had been used!!!! Tried to call the company i purchased it thru and no one answered!!! Had to purchase my own clamps and gaskets. Exhaust works but the rest really sucked!!
5,good album,"I actually got it for my dad...he loves this type of music.But I copied it for myself...and really liked it. Its a great ""I need motivation to move around and clean my house"" kinda music. Good for a workout too."
5,A lovely Cran album at a bargain price,"I would buy this CD at ""normal"" CD prices; as it was I got one for the house and one for the car. As one reviewer observed you may not want to go by the track listing -- and this is not a compilation of scattered tunes as the title suggests. This is instead a very fine set of tunes by a very fine group of traditional/contemporary Celtic musicians. It is sad that Cran is not receiving any money from this, but hopefully it brings in some new fans."
1,Warning,"If you're looking at Amazon's track list for this CD and the first song is ""The Dusty Miller/Cucanandy,"" be aware that you will probably be sent a different ""Irish Jigs and Reels"" with the same cover/color scheme, but a different set of songs. I own the CD with ""The Dusty Miller/Cucanandy,"" which I ordered from Amazon a few months ago, and it is excellent. However, I recently ordered another copy as a gift and was surprised to see a new set of songs on an otherwise identical-looking CD. They sent a replacement and it was still the wrong one.I listened to the ""updated"" CD and it's not nearly as good as the previous one, but enjoyable nonetheless. It consists of 12 fast-paced reels/jigs and no singing. I gave the one-star rating so people can be aware of this discrepancy."
4,world in conflict,"Very interesting slant on imnportant factors during World War IIthat I had not heard of up till now. This is not an attempt to rewrite history, but does reveal that many important considerations were not appreciated at the time. For example, we were not outnumbered during the the early stages of the war, but out generaled. Then as now, the ""spin"" put on events became history. All in all a well written easy read for any history buff."
2,Well...,"A good cd for starting didjeridu-lovers, but if you learn more of the instrument and if you listen to various artists, such as David Blanasi, Alan Dargin, Adam Plack and Charlie McMahon, you'll leave this cd in it's case for a long time... However, it's a relaxing, meditational-like album for listening in the background. Especially the song 'awakenings' sounds really good early in the morning!"
3,It's hard to complain when it costs $6,"The production is bad, the didjeridoos sound muffled and muddy. Seems like a thrown-together, kind of half-assed recording. The liner notes are vague and full of misinformation. So there, I guess I did manage to complain after all. But.. yeah, for six dollars, I can't feel too ripped off. It's hard to find decent, authentic recordings of Australian aboriginal music (in my experience, anyway). And while this may not be a decent, authentic recording of Australian aboriginal music, I still get some enjoyment from listening to it. I have to take what I can get, I guess."
5,Brilliant adaptation of Lillian Hellman's play,"Although because of censorship problems, the screen adaptation of Hellman's play, couldn't be as faithful to the source, as the 1961 movie version, also directed by Wyler, anyhow this is an oustanding picture.This because all it's about is the effect of a malicious lie in a group of people's lives, and I must say that watching both versions the other day on TCM, this is superior to the 1961 remake.The children's performances are outstanding, especially brattish and malevollous Bonita Granville...the three leads (Hopkins, Oberon and McCrea) are excellent too....and so are Catherine Doucet, as the unbearable aunt Lily and Alma Kruger as Granville's grandmother.Once more we must thank producer Sam Goldwyn, for trying to raise the american cinema's level by producing such great and high quality pictures, like this one, ""Dodsworth"", ""Wuthering Heights"", et al.A truly powerful movie."
4,Child actress Bonita Granville,Bonita Granville did an absolutely excellent job playing the role of a 12 to 13 year old spoiled school girl who ruins the lives of three young adults by making up malicious lies about them.
1,NOT a happy customer,I bought this as a gift for my parents and just found out [Dec. 25th] they need to also purchase a transmitter to get the darn thing to even work. The picture shows the transmitter- there is NO mention of requiring this piece as well. This information is necessary in order for someone to make an educated decision on whether or not to buy. What a slippery marketing tactic.
2,Need Improvements,"I worked on the past with Arena and since 2005, I did not have more contact with this simulator, for this reason I took the decision to buy a book, just to refresh my knowledge.I would like to give 5 stars for this one, but even thinking about 3 stars, you have to be very generous.The content on the index gives the impression that the book will cover the main subjects. But when you start to do the examples, you have to decipher some steps that are not clear.I spent so much time just looking for the right information, mainly because the final reports do not match with the book examples.The exercises available do not have answers, so you will never know if you are on the right direction.I am very disappointed with this book, I took the decision to buy another one (Simulation with Arena by W. Kelton, R. Sadowski and N. Swets)"
4,Near perfect,"I got this pistol today and played with it. It is powerful and feels good in my hand. The high rate of fire makes it a perfect sidearm for any sniper. I gave it 4 stars because when i got it, charged it, and fired it it didnt. the slide was stuck i had to force it the first few times plus spare magazines are impossible to find. All and all i love it and am glad i bought it."
2,Functional but Unconfortable,"This is perhaps one of the most innovative (yet imcomplete) inventions since the watch (time piece). Incomplete in that, it is also the most unconfortable thing to where. Not to mention very bulky. A leather (or some kind of elastic) band would have solved all of that. I returned it in one week. ...did I mention it needed a leather band. Oh yeah, LEATHER BAND PLEASE."
3,The Sound Quality is Lacking!,"Don't get me wrong, I love John Denver's music, but the sound quality of this CD was disappointing after having recently heard the ""A Celebration of Life"" CD. That CD, played on the same player as this one, had a richer and fuller sound, almost like he was right there in the room singing. Almost all of the familiar titles are there, along with some not as familiar. However, I can't imagine why Take Me Home, County Roads wasn't included on an album entitled ""The Very Best of John Denver"". I guess you get what you pay for."
4,grape seed extract.,Seems to be quality. fill is consistent from capsule to capsule. Don't know yet about efficacy. Will update as necessary.
4,This is not a dry history.,"The tradition of naturopathic medicine has its roots in the European nature cure movement of the nineteenth century. This book elegantly captures the growth of this tradition into a dicipline through the stories of the great nature doctors. This is not a dry history. It is a telling of the principles and methods of naturopathic medicine through life stories of the men and women who developed it. What I appreciated most about the book were the quotes. These nature doctors were colorful characters who didn't mince words with the medical establishment--""the pill jesuits and poisoners""-of their time"
1,unfortunate,"There is some interesting history in medicine back in the 1800's and early 1900's, and some interesting issues to mull over. Unfortunately this book makes the history uninteresting, the characters two dimensional, and the issues are really not dealt with at all.You would be better off looking at the history through some other lens than this book."
1,unreadable and unworkable.,"This is the new ""less is more"" bible, taken to comic extremes. Worse, I found this book almost unreadable, mainly because Gardner is so full of himself. Witness his comparison of the wildly successful Suzuki approach with Spectrum schools that use his multiple intelligences ideas--a comparison surely used to imply that the Spectrum approach is similarly successful, without any evidence. Sadly, no matter how hard he tries--and he's trying hard--his multiple intelligences end up being used as excuses for failures more than guidelines for success in the real world.Most amusing to me is the notion that this plan is workable. Who does Gardner think can follow this plan? Those that emerge from schools of education have the MOST undisciplined minds--in his sense--produced in the universities: their time is dominated by methods classes, not training in the disciplines. A genius like Gardner, with a class of five, could make a go of it--in the real world, there is no chance."
3,So bad it's good,"This movie has become an in-joke with our crowd. How could it not? The cheesy lines, the barely-there plot and clothing, nudity at the drop of a hat (and if there's no reason for it, a dream sequence is in order!): It makes for bad movie gold. Great filmmaking it's not, but entertaining it is, unintentionally."
4,"Good product, but 8 oz is quite a lot of dried green onion","Product was received promptly. The onions taste fine. However, based on my previous rate of use, this bag was ~50 years of dried onion. I gave half the bag to a friend (nearly a gallon bag full). So maybe buy this to share."
3,There are some worthwhile tracks here,"There's a fairly decent variety on this CD. But there's so much more that until recently, Amazon didn't carry - if you want a rock beat, try artists like Oif Simchas or Piamenta. There's my personal favorite, Lipa Schmeltzer - check out ""The New Project X"" for a CD sure to get people on the dance floor. There are great wedding albums by Neginah, Neshama and a number of other popular wedding bands. And among the best is ""What A Wedding in Overtime"". Amazon now offers them from seller MostlyMusic so perhaps search by seller if you're not quite sure what you're looking for. You won't regret it when everyone at the wedding is dancing up a storm! I have no affiliation with this seller, I just love the music, and am glad this shidduch now exists."
1,sounds worse than the laptop speakers,"The builtin speakers in my laptop sounded better and louder than these speakers. The Sony's highs are muddy and the volume does not go very loud (yes my laptop volume was all the way up). If you want extra laptop speakers for your presentations with clients look elsewhere. All we wanted was a decent quality sound that was a little louder than our laptop speakers and these speakers definitely did not deliver and will be returned. If you need ultra portable sound and your laptop speakers are broken or sound much worse than average laptops (we have nothing special), then maybe this would work for you."
3,Unsure,"I bought this air purifer for my teenage daughter's room. She has severe allergies and we have done everything to help make her comfortable, mattress case, pillow case and allergy shots. But she still woke up with a stuffy nose in the morning. We have had the purifier for approximately one month-sometimes she wakes up clear and sometimes she wakes up stuffy, so I'm not sure if I'd buy this product again."
2,The cover is better than the book,"This story is told from the perspective of a 15-year-old Indian girl -- but it lacks the meaning and perspective a writer should bestow to make it a novel, not just a a series of events. Unlike the rich and colorful cover, the writing style is flat and trite, at times reading like the writer's journals and therapy notes, sometimes pedantic lecturing on Indian views. I didn't care about the characters, who remained flat and lifeless to me."
4,beautiful though not perfect,"While the book maybe slightly simplistic, it still had some wonderful moments that make it worthwhile. The main character, or at least some of her concerns and ideas, are well-developed and much of the text is beautiful. Other characters, mostly Jani and the mother, are presented as interesting frameworks but need to be expounded upon more. Overall its quite worth the read."
2,Inheritance,"The book, Inheritance by Indira Ganesan is a fiction novel. Sonil finds the perfect escape from her mother's lack of affection and passion, by involving herself in a scenario that is almost identical to her mother's ill-fated affair with her English father. Her affair provides Sonil with an opportunity for self-discovery and she is able to understand and eventually forgive her mother. The plot is predictable, much like a soap-opera. The author portrays India as a non-forgiving society. The impressions of India are much too negative, especially considering the author spent very little of her life there. The island, which is a haven for Sonil, provides a direct contrast to the harsh India. The title refers to her inheritance, which is actually the repetition of history throughout her life. The book is entertaining but without depth. I give it two stars."
3,Why is Ms. Ganesan so hell bent on destroying innocence?,"The book did not leave me asking for more. I was happy to put it down and not worry about it again. The book does not appear to be a commentary on life or society. The author's capacity to tell a story is nice and I found the book to be an easy read. I would have loved it, if the girl, Sonil, inspite of all her serious mistakes, turned out to be a wonderful Zoologist. If not any thing, that would have been a culmination of a wonderful dream of an innocent girl. Write so that I can dream about some thing wonderful. Don't tell me how screwed up we can make our lives. We have Jerry Springer for that."
1,Not that much good,I feel the author doesn't know what she is talking about.A fifteen year old girl will date an American and every afternoon she will hang out in the cafe..She will talk about the books and american culture..I don't know any girl in India will be like that...especially in island...Of all these she will drink wine and beer...common give me a break!
1,Disappointingly unrealistic!,"Forget the syntactical eccentricities that remain such even if the aim was to come over as original rather than merely ungrammatical. What is irritating to folks like me who actually grew up in India, is to know just how far removed this book is from any realistic evocation of the country. Why doesn't the author write of a place she has actually experienced, not wishes she had? I look forward to mature fiction written about what Ganesan really knows, not adolescent stuff about what she imagines she does. The book is disappointing for its outright mistakes too: For example, was Indonesia ever French? Or did she mean Indochina?"
1,Not worth the price,"There are some formulas, but no explanation how they are arrived at and how they can be applied in practice. I tried to get some sense of it from the VBA programs but the programs are password protected. If you want to learn how to apply the theory in real practice, the following are better alternatives: Advanced modelling by Jackson and Staunton; Implementing derivatives models by Clewlow and Strickland; Analysing & interpreting the yield curve by Choudhry."
3,Need better charging set up.,Easy to hook up to system but difficult to get them set back on the carrier and charge. You have to set these babies on just right and wiggle them a little to get them to hook up and charge. Sound is great. Quality great. Would still buy them again. Wish they would improve the charging system however.
4,Work just fine,I've used the headphones for a few months. A little static comes through at low volume but goes away at higher volumes. Not for high-end audio enjoyment. Range is 10ish feet from the base station. I would buy them again for my office.
3,headphone review,"The headphones work well, but the charging system connectivity is really bad. It is almost impossible to get the small probe on the charger to connect with the small probe on the headset when you set the headphones in the charging cradle...very frustrating and a very poor design by Sony!"
3,Not good for laptop users in bed,I bought this to listen to the tv while my fiance' sleeps but also often use the laptop while in bed and watching. The problem is that since this if IR based it needs a clear line of sight to the receiver and the lapscreen cause interference.Like other reviews I confirm it is a major pain trying to get the headphones on the charger just right to charge. Look for one that uses induction.
1,Rating of Sony Headphone,I was disappointed in the bulkiness of the headset and of the size of the controls. If you have the volume up for other people to listen while you use the headset the reception is poor. I have another Sony head set that came with another TV set that is superior in size and control. Disappointed.
1,Would never buy again!!,"poor quality, doesn't fit a tall person (6'6"") lose sound just moving away from transmitter. headset hard to replace on charger. wish I could get my money back on these. These are not a better idea from sony for sure!!I wouldn't give it 1 star except amazon requires you to rate it, how about allowing half a star?"
1,Wireless Headphone,Maybe I just don't understand this wireless system. My husband and I purchased these because he watches TV in bed. He is hard of hearing and turns the volume up to the point it keeps me awake.But with this wireless headset we thought you would not have to hear the volume on the TV at all. Well that's not true. It says turn the source of the volume up instead of the headset so there is no hissing. Well you can still hear the hissing and the TV volume is still turned up loud.We adjusted the base and he is not far from it. He still has to have the volume on the TV turned up. I thought it was just him so I tried them and I had the same problem. TV had to be turned up loud and static was unbearable for my ears.SO WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THE WIRELESS HEADSET IF I CAN STILL HEAR THE TV?
2,Sony MDR-IF540RK consumer review,"I returned the product to the retailer. There was excessive fuzz when turning the volume up. Example on a 1-10 volume scale, the fuzz noise was obvious at about 3-4 and got louder as the volume was turned up. The fuzz sound was excessive and distroyed the sound clairity. This is totally unaccetible for a $70 pair of headphones. I was about 2 feet away from the infrared transmitter with no obstructions so distance or user error was not an issue"
1,Bad Experience,"I purchased the Sony MDRRF960RF Wireless Headphones three weeks ago. After ten minutes of use, a loud popping occurs, as if a capaciter is shorting out. When I said loud popping, I mean loud popping. The power to the transmitter immediately goes out. Sony Service in Laredo, TX has had them for two weeks now and has done nothing to address my concerns. I'm sure I just got a ""bad"" set, but Sony Service could at least contact me and answer my questions as what they are going to do, and when."
1,NOT GOOD...NOT WORTH THE MONEY,Not a good product. Very short range...interference/static sound would never stop plus the sound was not the greatest either. For 20.00 more I purchased the ROCKETFISH RF-WHP02 and that for sure is an EXCELLENT product! Don't waist your money in the Sony.
4,Great Headphones,I just wish they were a little less bulky but other than that I am very satisfied with the headphones.
1,These are great if your intention is to keep your ears warm,"Sound is horrible and when they do decide to work don't move an inch, turn your head and your in static city."
1,Did not even work at all.,"Had to send these back to amazon, they never worked. Charged them all night and the next day, nothing. Did not purchase anymore. Sony has really gone down hill."
1,Loud hissing sound,I returned these headphones after one day. There was a loud hissing sound that was unbearable!
3,MDR-IF540RK,"I'll try not to repeat previous comments.Chunky, heavy headphone but comfortable for long-term use. I have two of this, on one unit the charge light stay on indicating the batteries not fully charged on either headset even when both units are fully charged. You could use two headsets at the same time with one transmitter but when one headset is charging the respective transmitter is disabled.Nice clean full body sound when within the range of the transmitter, as good as my electret headphone. My problem with the MDR-IF540RKs is when close to a computer, sitting on a massage chair or walking on a treadmill, the interference from other electrical or electronic systems is horrible. So the sound could be excellent to unrecognizable dependent of the headphone orientation and proximity to other electrical devices."
2,You get what you pay for,This is a terrible product. I sat right in front of the transmitter and the hissing noise was overwhelming. The build of both the headphones and docking station felt cheap. And placing the headphones on the dock was a challenge. I returned these immediately.
3,Not bad for price paid,"The headphones are adequate. I had done a lot of research, and discovered that a more expensive headset is not necessarily best. For watching TV - I'm satisfied.Pros: light headset, doesn't hurt to wear for an hour or so. The sound is really not that bad. Sometimes I get a hiss, but I've had worse.Con: I don't really like the design of the re-charge connection. It's clumsy and difficult to line up. A bit of a pain in the neck to set correctly. [at least the red light lets you know whether or not it's connected]"
1,Terrible. Not worth the purchase.,"I am a huge fan of Sony hardware, but these are awful. They are infrared only, which means line of site. If you move back more than about 10 feet or so, you will quickly lose reception. Additionally, these constantly emit a hissing noise. It has a vibration feature, which is kind of like a bass kick and rumble function, but it does not work very well. I have a pair of Sennheiser 130's which I like much better. The only thing that can be said about these Sony headphones is that they are cheap..."
4,Sony MDR IF540RK Wireless Headphone system,I'm over all pleased with the head phones. The sound quality is great and the use of the special effects vibration is also great with the game console.The one draw back I overlooked is that it's laser connected so you have to have line of site so I can't leave to room to go to the kitchen for instance if I'm watching TV.
3,Barely Adequate,"Easy to set up, sound quality is fair. Thin, uncomfortable foam ear cushions and cheap plastic headstrap. Simple exercise motions enough to dislodge it from your head. Recharging system tacky - tricky to make charger align with contacts. LED transmitting lights didn't work.To reduce hiss turn up source volume, turn headset volume down.Barely good enough for casual, stationary use for limited time. Since I bought this primarily to use while exercising, I'll search out a more comfortable, better engineered model."
4,peace at last,"Finally I can sleep in on the weekends when my husband is watching the 3 stooges at 7:00 a.m. I realized we needed a decent set of headphones and I poured over the reviews for hours. We are not into audio, or theater, so to spend hundreds of dollars did not seem reasonable considering our only use might be an hour or two a week. These sony headphones are very much worth the money. They were simple to hook up and actually the reviews indicated the only problem was the strange way you needed to put them back on the charger. It does take a moment and if you just try to drop them on the charger you might get frustrated. Take a moment to visualize the contact pins and you will quickly set them on correctly. Trying to do it blindly is a hit and miss.If you are an audio or theater enthusiast, you might want to upgrade from here, but I think for even family entertainment they are a good value. We are pleased with the purchase."
3,"Almost there, but not quite","Switch & dial on the headphone not very user friendly, difficult.Can't be sure when/if the headphones are seated properly for charging.Low level background/signal noise in the headphones."
2,sony wireless headphones,"ok i ordered the wrong one, i wanted wireless head phones but not this one,if u move around within 10 ft u lose sound,pluse u can't walk behine a wall stops working and it doesn't set well in its stand, not happy with it"
2,wrong idea,this product sounds like a great idea and for the money is still not a bad purchase. i believe my intentions were too much. i expected to have no static and have clear sound. due to the wireless feature there was noticeable static.
2,Sony wireless headset,"I was disappointed in this product. I chose this because of the Sony brand name. The headset is not as comfortable as others I have had, the charging cradle does not easily accept the set, and the sound is not a clear as others."
4,Sony MDR-If54rk Headphones,"Im a little hard of hearing, they work great for watching TV. Very comfortable. Connected to ATT u-verse box. Others can listen at volume they wish. No more complaints of tv being too loud."
4,Wireless headset,"I bought these as a gift for my husband. He is hard of hearing so we had to listen to the TV very loud. These definitely help him and us. He can hear the TV great with these and we are not deafened. Would recommend them. Although there is a lot of feedback, it's not enough to put you off."
1,Whats the BUZZ about t his product,"There are two flaws with this product.1) The cradle/charging system is very hard to properly engage although the charging light lets you know when your 5 minutes of struggle has finally succeeded.2) The sound quality (volume and clarity, lack of static) is poor unless you spend al ot of time getting it adjusted just right -- between the controls on my new Sony Bravia LCD TV and those on the headset.I bought this product because I thought the IR transmitter would be compatable with the IR transmitter in my Toyota Sienna entertainment system, and I could use the extra headsets from there as well.I was absolutely right and indeed, they work with the Sony IR transmitter --- and I would say they produce a lot better sound quality than the rechargeable headsets that came with this transmitter."
2,Ugh. Not the songs I remember...,"Ugh. Darn. Got me again. This is not a collection of the songs that were played on the radio. It is a collection of songs with the same title, but sung in a totally different way. The renditions are tired, strained, and seem to be missing the ""magic"" I remember and find on other CDs. BEWARE. BE DISAPPOINTED. NOT THE SONGS YOU ARE EXPECTING. JDMc"
3,"Great value, but failed after 50 cycles","It is mostly what it looks like. I am using it to lock the handles of a two door cabinet, and I wanted something that wouldn't mar the finish, and for that it is excellent. It wouldn't stop a determined attack, but it more than let's people know that honest people should stay out.Well, this lock has been in use for less than two months, opened and closed less than fifty times, and it is becoming very difficult to open. I have decided today to retire it as I fear it will leave me stranded if it fails to open. It may have been abused by someone trying to open it, and since I don't know that factor, I will only lower the score two stars. It has been used only indoors."
3,excellent content but hard to manipulate,"Touching, comprehensible, very helpful, but the lack of numbered sections means no way to stop and return to the place you'd left or to find something you'd like to review."
3,Not bad.,"This 3M Filter is useful and is not expensive. It can protect your eye from the radiation and it also can reduce the glare, but the point is that filter comes with only one year warranty(not like some others with life time warranty)...."
3,Good basic introduction to Spanish,"This program is a very good introduction to Spanish, especially if the student has had no prior experience."
3,The pictures are very interesting but...,"Have you ever woken up in the morning and found that you have nothing to wear? Well now, you can learn how to put together new outfits and make new clothes out of the same book! Make matches you would have never thought of and have fun doing it. It's all about clothes. Find the teen fashionista in yourself.This book has such great capacity to be good. The title is intriguing and interesting. However, I do not think that the book contains enough things that were promised. The book only contains a few tips on what you should wear and a lot of it is bulked out with pictures. Admittedly, the pictures are very interesting, but they do not teach us about what clothes we should wear. It is the start to a very interesting topic but I think that it needs more.Reviewed by a student reviewer for Flamingnet Book Reviewswww.flamingnet.comPreteen, teen, adn young adult book reviews and recommendations"
5,Younger Days.,Brought back many memories of my youth.When I would listen for these songs to be play on the radio and record them on my cassette player.
3,Heavy and feels like my head is in a vice,"The adjustable strap on top is comfortable.The ear pads fit comfortable over the ear(I'm 6'2"").The eight foot coiled cord is great!However, the spring that is on the back of the unit makes my head feel like it is in a vice. I wore these for 2 hours to test them, and while the may be good in outdoor applications (if you have a smaller head than I do), these were not comfortable for in-home listening. I actually had a headache after wearing these, so I promptly returned them."
3,"Really quiet, but not built to last","I bought this for work, since I work in a very noisy environment. The passive noise-cancelling is superb, no batteries required! They're pretty tight on your head and take a while to get used to, and will be uncomfortable the first few times wearing them. They stay snug on your head though. Sound quality was average, not particularly great for music, but good enough.I rate them only 3/5 stars because after a few months they wore out. The ear cushion is apparently filled with a liquid gel, and the cushion became brittle and tore, the oily gel leaked out. Koss's warranty makes you pay for shipping, and since I only paid $30 for them it wasn't worth it. These headphones may be fine for occasional use, but if you plan on using them every day like I did at a job, they won't last, and I would suggest getting something more durable."
2,Huge and heavy,"If there was a picture of these headphones, you'd see what I mean. These headphones work by ""passive"" noise reduction - the pieces that fit over the ear are made of layers and layers of sound absorbing material. These monstrous pieces cover your ears and are pushed hard against your head by an imposing thick behind-the-neck piece which sports the word ""KOSS"" in large letters across it, so you feel like a billboard. An adjustable velcro two-piece headstrap holds the contraption in place so that its massive weight rests squarely on top of your head. I tried these at work and was mistaken for an air traffic controller. They reduce noise, but after wearing them about 1/2 hour I developed a splitting tension headache -> my neck could not hold up all the weight, and I felt like a vise had been applied to my temples. These are not made for personal use, but rather for industrial high-noise situations. Returned the same day."
5,Outstanding bargain!,I bought these for use with my race scanner at the April NASCAR race in Texas and they worked perfectly. The noise reduction is great and the strap headband makes them comfortable to wear all afternoon in the Texas sun. I would cetainly recommend these to anyone looking to purchase.
1,not reliable or durable,Headphone wire from ear muff points up which leads to wearing down to a dodgy connection from the weight of the coil lead. Had to tape it in 'pointing up' position to get stereo sound within first week of use.Sound quality and noise reduction I was happy with.
5,"Great Product, Great for NASCAR","This headset is cheap, great quality and quick shipping. I was surprised by the really long cord and headphone jack adapter. I used it for a nascar race scanner and it has plenty of volume adjustment."
1,Koss,"over rated and over priced, I purchased a set for my metal detector and discovered how poorly they performed, If I could have listened to them before I purchased them I would not have bought a pair, also they are very heavy and uncomfotable to wear, my $10 pair of headphones sound and wear alot better than these koss units but they do not have a volume control, koss used to make some pretty good stuff but this unit needs to be redesigned.."
4,Great headphones,"I do maintenance for a little league complex and am on a noisy riding mower for approx 3 to 4 hours a day ... these headphones are just what the doctor ordered...very good noise cancelling, a little clunky with an extra long cord but overall excellent for what I do."
3,"Great sound, too tight",I had to return them. Bought for mowing but were too uncomfortable. My head is on the larger side. Maybe OK for the average melon.
2,Not what I expected,"These headphones were a disappointment. First of all the headphone use ""passive"" noise reduction. I should have studied this more carefully but Koss is clearly trying to blur the line here between these headphones and true noise cancellation headphones.Second, what is with the inflexible metal band?! This may be good is you are driving a race car but unless you have loads of room in your carry-on (who does?) then it makes it quite akward to travel with these on airplane flight."
3,Headphone Review,"I just used the headphones on two flights. The headphones do block out the noise from the plane very well. However, the only problem is that there is a metal band that goes around the back of the head. That is very uncomfortable when you rest your head on the seat. You actually get the vibrations of the plane in the headphones."
2,what a TERRIBLE buy!,"I purchased the Koss QZ-5 Headphones.THESE ARE NOT ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES!!!I was duped. I believed these were active noise cancelling headphones, but they reduce noise by adding a ton of padding. These headphones are HUGE. The picture displayed is very decieving, only showing you the profile of the headphones. If you wear it and look in a mirror, you will look like a geeky mickey mouse. They stick out of the sides of your head making you look like a weirdo.In addition to that, the sound quality is extremely poor. At the moment I am listening to the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack, and any bass makes the headphones crackle. Bass performance is absolutely poor. Do not get these headphones, they are a waste of money. Do not get these headphones!"
4,"Good for mowing the lawn, part duex","I will echo vander-reviewers comments about this headset. They don't cancel the roar of my Deere, but they attenuate it to a comfortable level making it possible to enjoy music while I mow. It takes some adjustment to get it to fit comfortably over a ball cap and sunglasses, if not you'll notice some discomfort after an hour or so. (Lucky vander-r, my lawn takes 4 hours on a good day.)"
5,Great!,"This ring wasn't quite as heavy as I expected but it actually works well for an index finger ring or even a thumb ring. The seller was fantastic...got it quickly. I ordered the wrong size, I sent it back for an exchange, got the ring back very quick and didn't even have to pay a shipping charge for them to ship it back to me. Very satisfied"
2,irish wedding ring,"I bought this ring to replace my wedding ring after I broke my ring finger and my old ring didn't fit. When I got it, the ring seemed like cheap aluminum. I guess you get what you pay for. My daughter wears it now and likes it. That is why I gave it 2 stars."
4,One Tough Skin!,This is a great product at a very reasonable price. It does a great job at protecting your Ipod from bumps and drops but I found it very difficult to put on and take off. The only reason I gave it four stars is because you have to remove the ToughSkin if you use a dock to link to your computer or stereo.
5,GOOD...BUT ALL THE CDS NEED REMASTERING,"This best of is just another example of the need of remastering the whole catalog. There are great songs lost as a result missing from Happy Families, Mange Tout, and Believe You Me. Waves, included here, has the possiblity of making one forget the troubles of the day and place one in the middle of a quick vacation of fun, clouds, and humor, what other bands can you say have done that?Do not overlook this band...they had more talent than Depeche Mode, and others, at this time, and one wishes that they should have persued making more music together.It's like a beautiful flower cut down...it makes one cry."
4,Usefull resources on a dry topic,The process of aquiring and implementing the requirements for any project can be difficult. To read a book on the subject can be worse. This title succeeds where others fail. It is full of usefull resources and practical examples.Project management and development is more an exercise is psychology than architecture. The Robertsons are aware of this and build their methods around human interaction.I'm glad I read it. I learned quite a bit. The other books reccomended throughout this title are a great find and the recipe for the perfect dry martini is in fact quite accurate.Jean-Charleswww.FlashCodersNY.org
4,"Good wheat, but lots of chaff","There is some great content in this book, and the writing style is fun and engaging. But at the same time the book often goes here and there with lots of extraneous information, which while interesting, is also distracting.The book covers conventional project management in a compelling and interesting way, and offers practical experienced based insights. Based on that I would give it five stars. The centering of the management process around requirements is a great idea. And the use of lo-fi prototypes is genius. So there is great content in here. But, unfortunately the distracting content and the sub-par quality of the illustrations leads me to give it a four out of five.Still, if you are looking for a way to break out of the mold of your current development process. And you are looking for something that could lead to a more compelling product design for your customer. You may find the answer you are looking for in this book."
3,A good overview book,"I think this is a book for persons wanting a subject overview. It contains a lot of discussions but, in my opinion, too few practical rules."
3,Sizing & Warmth,"It is a very nice product without a doubt. Just to let others know, I normally wear a medium no problem, I would need a small without a doubt. Tons of fabric hanging off of me. I suggest 1 size down.Also I knew prior to purchase it wasn't a softshell so wind might be an issue, even the slightest breeze on a mild day (55-60 Roughly) the wind cut right through it as if I didn't even have a sweat shirt on.It is a great product just not for late fall, spring would be best or a mild year round climate.Happy Hunting :)"
3,Great characters,"While it started slow, it really picked up steam toward the end. I want another. The characters were very rich, the action fast. My main nit pick was the point of view changes. It does indeed remind me of conan, for better or worse."
3,Great story that could ue some work,"I liked the world. I like the characters. The style was fresh, and different from msot fantasy books I've read recently. Hard to explain exatcly. It has swords, magic, all sort of creatures.. except hsoe typically found in fantasy. I don't recall one elf or dwarf mentioned. I was taken aback by the ending, but a great setup for the second one (if there is going to be a second on) I guess.Pros:Great characters. They start out one way and really develop throughout.Cool settings. You feel liek your're there.Interesting twist in the end.He's from MI.Cons:Worst copyediting ever. Every book has some mistakes, but I caught a few that hsould hve been obvious.Too short.The ending may turn some off."
4,I liked it,"Good, quick read. Loads of action. Liked the characters. What more can I say? I like action and this had it. Not sure I liked the ending, I would have doen it different that's for sure. Certainly took me by surprise, which I guess was it's intent. I especially liked Cizdan and sisbaen better than any of the heroes. Freaky twins."
1,"Well, ppl, where do I start? brb","This is truly an appalling piece of garbage. If you part with any of your hard earned on this then I certainly feel very sorry for you.Honestly, if you feel the need to read something written by a pre-schooler then go to your local creche."
3,Not bad.,"I've read better, I've read worse :) Adarm is one messed up dude, but I guess with those swords. Well, I won't give away any details. My main complaint was the copyediting I guess. I found a few mistakes here and there. But despite that, I found it to be a different and overall good read. Definitly gets better towards the end IMO and there are no elves in it!! wow.. bucks the trend I guess. I liked all the other, different creatures in it tho. It's packed with em."
3,Could be better,"Although equipped with some neat gadgets, this doll bears little resemblance to Luke Skywalker as depicted in the movies by Mark Hamill. I was reminded more of a wrestler! A bit overpriced too. THere are more realistic Luke dolls on the market."
2,The DVD from This publications,"We ordered all three of their publications. Unfortunatley, 65% or more of the items were repeated on all three DVD. There was very little new from one to other DVD. However, whatever was given was useful."
5,Works Great,"I bought this item from another website and paid 90 dollars for it. Fist off the price here is amazing, second this really works. After ther first two days of using it i was able to do more reps and gained a lot of energy. Also the soarness in my muscles were decreased even though i was lifting more and doing more reps."
4,Good product to get you back in the gym,"The reason why I purchased this product was because I was too lazy to motivate myself to go back to the gym. I thought to myself, if I spend $70, I can't waste it by not going.Anyways, I was on the stack for a full 15 days. I was able to do much more in the gym such as 5 set exercises instead of the normal 3 set exercises. I was able to lift much more too. There was also a shift in weight going from 155 to 162 over the 15 day period.After I got off the stack was where things changed. I wasn't able to do as many sets but I was able to do the same amount after I got off the stack and I didn't lose the weight or size."
3,Good for starters....,"You will not get serious results from just 15 days. I used this stack just to see how it made me feel, if the pills would make me sick or not. Once i finished the 15 days i felt good & ended up buying a 3 month supply of the Creakic Hardcore & the Leukic Hardcore. The Gakic Hardcore did give me the extra strenghth to do a few more reps. Over all i would recommend this stack to anyone looking for that extra edge, and see how it makes them feel. But it should say 15 day trial cycle...Not 15 day transformation cycle..."
4,Satisfied,"This product was very effective, and also helped me to keep a schedule and stick to it for working out. I am satisfied with the results."
5,transformation is for real,this product is great my strength has gone up so much and muscletone is being shown
2,"buy cheap stuff, get cheap quality","I purchased this product to install a stereo deck in my 1998 Mercury Sable.As soon as I opened the box I was unimpressed with the quality and style.The plastic is poor quality and did not fully fit flush in the dash,and I could not find a way to hook up the rear defroster with the wiring harness it came with.as well as the backlights for the a/c controls.THIS IS NOT AN EASY INSTALL.You have like 10 feet of wires to run from the dash to the trunk.I attempted to do this myself and ended up having to take my car to BestBuy to finish the install.& I am a pretty technically inclined person.over all this was a pain in my butt and I wish I had bout the more expensive kit."
3,Simplifying too much makes information useless,"This book is the course-book of course 308, ""Information Management"" at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE). The book is aimed at people who are, or want to be, CEOs or CIOs. It presents several models for strategic IS management."
2,Got 24 months out of it.,"First purchased this in Nov 2003 and I was somewhat disappointed in the bass and very little sound from rear speakers, but kept it anyway. Probably because I got it at Fry's for $199. I have it connected to the TV so it runs almost every day but it just died tonight with the 'F61' error (power supply). I can't even find the SC-HT650 model on the Panasonic web site, so I assume they are pretty much ashamed of it. Not buying Panasonic again. Sony has a new system that ships with wireless rear speakers and 1000 watts. It's the Wireless DVD Dream System DAV-FX100W and it's $900 retail. If you call the Sony business number and ask for the 'employee discount' I got a quote of $670. Our company buys product from Sony so I'm not sure if this is for any company or what. ?"
1,Stopped working after a year and a half,"After a year and a half of moderate use, this product just died with an ""F6"" error (power supply problem). Me being a knucklehead decided to order a $70 part to fix it which would take a pro to install; so I just decided to cut my losses and junk it. A true piece of junk. Meanwhile my first DVD player; a JVC which I sold to my friend for $50, is working great."
2,Disappointing,"Written in a chatty but unfocused and messy style, this book is 50% scholarly bistory and 50% gossip. There is nothing wrong in principle with this mix, which could make for a very entertaining story. Except that the scholarly stuff is poorly explained so that the nonspecialist has no idea what the words and concepts mean, while the gossip is mostly parochial and unilluminating. Reading this book is like being married to an ambitious linguist: through repetition you become familiar with the names but, at length, couldn't care less about this irrevelant war between tiny piranhas in an academic fishbowl. All in all confirms my general belief that, in the social sciences, eloquence, charisma and the ability to bully others into submission matter more than being right, assuming such a thing is even possible."
2,Arrived not working.,I ordered this to have it for a weekend framing project. It arrived in time. But when I plugged it into the compressor air came pouring out of the cap! I eventually called Bostich customer service. When I described the problem they immediately said they would be sending out a repair kit that would arrive in 7 to 10 buisness days. So much for having it for my project. But credit to customer service for the no-hassle and quick solution.I'll update this when I get the repair kit and get the tool working.
4,Have not used it yet.,"I discovered palm-nailers while watching TV. The electric thingamabop from Home Depot is crap, but I have not tried pneumatic yet. I bought it for gutter and joist hangers, and living in Maine, will probably not start using it until spring. Everything was in the box and very quickly delivered from Amazon, but not in time to finish the gutter work. Gave a four star rating for quick delivery, price and appearance. Cannot grade performance yet. The leather glove did not have instructions, but perserverence and muscle streched it on the nailer. Seems comfortable, but heavier than I anticipated."
5,I'll never use a hammer again.,"Title says it all. This is the best tool in the box. Not only does it make nailing effortless, it makes it enough fun to entice my teenage son to get involved in a small platform making project. Buy a quality nailer like this one and use it for the rest of your life."
2,Terrible User Manual for Bostitch Palm Nailer,"The user manual and accompanying information with the Bostitch palm nailer that I purchased has got to be the worst that I have ever gotten with a tool. It's so vague that using this tool without other instructions from another palm nailer manufacturer may actually be dangerous; had to download the Porter Cable user manual. In fact, if you need a good palm nailer I would suggest looking at the Porter Cable; at least their user manual tells you how to use the darned thing. The only good thing in buying this item was the great price and fast delivery by Amazon."
1,Unusable,The instructions were not only of no help they gave dangerously misleading information. The nail adapter supplied had an oval bored nail holder that didn't fit the nails I wanted to use. I was unable to remove it after applying considerable force. Not really sure how to either. No information on the company site or the 'net. There is a leather thingy that looks like a support garment for a miniature dairy cow no way it would fit. Returned it. Too bad as it looked like just what I need.
5,Holy Hammerhead,I just put the Bostich PN100K though a weekend of hard framing work and I can't say enough good things about it. After a couple of days of use I can't imagine life without this tool. By the end of the first day I was driving nails better than I could have swinging a hammer and in a second it was done. If it needed one more blow to set it that was a piece of cake. I could write paragraphs on it but suffice it to say that unless I only have one or two nails to drive I'm using this nailer.
5,Wow I love this Nailer.,"I love it. This is one tool that every DIYer needs. I first started using this tool to drive 18"" steel spikes in landscape timbers for raised beds. I've used it build raised beds and several other places where it wasn't possible to drive a fastener any other way. If you need to drive those long ""barn"" nails, you need this tool. As long as you have compressed air and enough air hose, you can use it almost anywhere."
5,Awesome tool,"This is perfect for nailing into tight places or when you simply have a lot of nails to drive. You do not need special nails for this. It would not take the place of a nail gun if I were a contractor but is much cheaper and meets my ""weekend warrior"" needs just fine at a fraction of the cost of a nail gun. All you simply do is push the nails into the wood. I have not had a problem yet."
4,Good But....,"For purposes used while palm nailing in crawl space under house, this tool worked extremely well.However, the kit clearly states that there are wrenches included to remove and reinstall the noses, there were no wrenches to be found.Point is, if it clearly states and one pays for what is clearly stated, it is obvious that quality control along the line, failed.Satisfied User of Palm Nailer for it did the job in extremely tight places"
4,Not as good as they used to be,"Stim-U-Dents used to be made in the USA of soft wood with no taste. They are now made in China of hard wood with a slight caustic taste. Still, there is no better alternative that I know of."
5,Good gums,We've used these for years. Our market stopped carrying them. They're an excellent way to keep gums healthy and free of periodontal disease.
2,Wrong guns listed for item.,"I purchaed these nails with the Porter Cable Coil250 nailer. It shows in the details that this gun will work with these nails, but it does not. The other guns are discontinued models or don't work with these nails except for the Hitatchi."
2,Maui - Mile by Mile: The Emperor Has No Clothes,"I love Maui. I have all the Maui guidebooks. I have property in Maui. So I had to get ""Maui - Mile by Mile, 2nd edition, fully illustrated with over 150 photographs,"" with a nice glossy color cover.Helllllo... Once you get past the cover, all the pictures are black and white. To be more accurate, the pictures look like they came off a basement laser printer that's low on toner - complete with vertical stripes. Do you know what pictures of rainforests look like in black and white? Gray doormats. Sunsets look like the Hiroshima blast. Self-publishing is great, but shouldn't there be a disclaimer or something? Get Maui Revealed instead - Twice the information with color pictures."
2,helpful but unnecessary,"Chances are this isn't your only Maui guidebook. If it is, you'll probably do fine with it. The book is small and light, which is a plus, but lacks color photos which are so often necessary in Maui. Honestly, we barely used it. Maui Revealed was much more useful and had all of the same info."
4,Beneficial to all Maui visitors,"You'd be hard pressed to find another book as advantageous as this one for Maui. Details are precise, photos are exceptional, ratings are accommodating and easy to use, and the style of writing is both endearing and classy. Many travel books to Hawaii sound generic, boring, and bland, but not Mile by Mile - the Aloha spirit is alive and well in this handbook. For the conventional Maui visitor of 5-12 days, this is the guide for you."
4,Single best road guide for Maui,This is the single best road guide for Maui. First heard of it on trip advisor - came highly recommended. Nothing compares to its coverage of the road to hana drive. The details available for each stop are great. There are also other interesting drives described inside detailing the eastern half of the island in full detail. The last chapter covers the rest.
5,Essential guide for the Road to Hana,We found this guidebook essential for the Road to Hana. The page by page mile marker sights were easy to follow along with while we were on the road. We didn't miss a thing!
3,Felt deceived,"Timely response and was kept informed as to the order status. I did, however, feel deceived since the picture on the item I ordered displayed a box of 8 coils and items received were boxes of 4 coils. I only received half of what I expected. I suggest that you either change the picture or ship what you display."
5,A Refreshing View,This is really a nice product. It examines the roll of the entrepreneur. They show just how important each is to the society around one. It gives hope that sound economical thinking is still here in America.
5,A MUST READ for all Dads: Old and New,"Downey's book is a must read for all dads, old and new to this game of parenting. I was the fortunate recipient of this book, and having read Downey's earlier book, ""So You're Gonna Be A Dad,"" I knew immediately that Downey would deliver with hilarious material that would make a difference in raising my two daughters. I have not been disappointed.One significant diifference between Downey's book and others is that his approach diminishes the anxiety that comes with being a dad. He lets you know that there's a lot of other guys going through the same things, and they're all doing just fine.Perfect holiday gift--better yet, the PERFECT gift to give Dad when his son or daughter turns two. I give Downey's book, ""Dads, Toddlers, and the Chicken Dance"" the highest rating possible: *****."
5,Laugh out loud funny and very helpful!,"A great book! Mr. Downey entertains while delivering important, every-day advice to new dads. Dad's will laugh out loud and feel re-assured that they're not total failures at fatherhood. With his unpretentious writing style and unique brand of wit, Mr. Downey covers everything from baby's first steps to ""permanent"" birth control options, and he never fails to entertain. Dad's can only hope that Mr. Downey continues to share his thoughts and experiences through his children's pre-pubescent and teen years."
3,A Lasting History,"Bryant, a historian of American business and University Dean, originally wrote this book in 1974 and it has been reprinted because of its timelessness. The book is a history text with limited illustrations. In very readable fashion, Bryant tells the story of the Santa Fe from Colonel Holliday's initial vision until 1971. No geographic region is singled out for special focus. This book has been the standard text on the history of the Santa Fe since its publication."
1,Never got it running,"Help!This game installs then plays the intro then the screen goes blank! When I emailed them they said it does not run on an Intel chipset. I thought almost everyone had an intel chipset.We are running Windows Xp, this is not an old computer!My sons were very upset ,,,we are hpoefully sending it back!"
1,NEW USER,"I also could not get the game to run. It would start and then give an error. Tried installing a couple times and still would not work. Looking at the other reviews, guess this is a common problem. It appears I have the minimum system requirements, but still doesn't work. I would not have purchased if I had known the problems."
2,Not credible,Rabbi Winter is supposed to be a wise narrator but [spoiler alert!]the plot of this book requires him to be totally clueless about the character of someone who is supposed to be a close friend. It is simply not believable given the portrait of Rabbi Winter as a man of deep insight and knowledge.A bridge too far for this reader....
5,Dull Topic Entertaining,"I could win awards for being a slow reader. Putting a book down is easy for me. By contrast, I was captivated by this one such that I had difficulty making myself stop reading to eat. While participating in the three-day Priority Project Management Breakthroughs training, our first night's homework assignment was to read the first 30 pages. Long before page 30 I was hooked. Mr. Kyle took an otherwise dull topic and brought it to life with such wit and wisdom that not only did I complete the book before the class ended (a personal record), but I understood Project Management so well that I felt like an expert upon its conclusion. This book makes the complicated art of project management a simple and humorous study in common sense and logic. It is so well written that I tend to think Mr. Kyle ought to quit his day-job and become a full-time author."
4,Wow a project managment book that does not put you to sleep,Making it Happen is a great book for people who have not performed much project management and a good read for those who have. The story takes a subject that is not very interesting and makes it an enjoyable read. I would not suggest this book as a complete guide to project management but it covers a lot of the hidden issues that can destroy a perfectly good project.
5,Great book,"100% agree with the other post. I would recommend this book to anyone who has the responsibility of managing projects. It is very easy and enjoyable reading. It's a great investment and reference book to keep around. Go ahead and buy it, you won't be sorryJames W."
3,Helpful,"The information is good, but it needs proof reading. I needed this for a class but I think I'll keep it."
5,Marvelous Mister,"My husband and i bought this martini mister for our friend for Christmas. He says it's a great gift, and because he drinks only martinis, is thrilled with it. A great gift for the martini drinker in your life."
5,Love It!,"This mister is the ideal device for getting just the right amount of vermouth into your martini. It holds a pretty decent amount of vermouth, so you don't have to refill it that often, but when you do, the little funnel that comes with it gets the job done. Highly recommended!"
3,Walk Series,"A great series for personal or family devotions, simple with neat tidbits of rabbinical information scattered throughout but not for one who wishes to study in depth. It's a walk in the park as opposed a hike in the wilderness."
5,Great DVD!!,"I bought a couple of the disks in this set for my wife. She needed a little training ;) She loved them and she definately learned a lot (I never knew I married such a hottie).Thanks,-Ryan"
5,Novel Fantasy,"I found this book in 1992 and loved it. I only managed to find the rest of the series on Amazon a year or so ago when they were republished, although I have been avidly searching for them ever since. That should tell you how much I enjoyed this one.The tale is interesting. It is firmly a fantasy, but manages to avoid so much that is sterotypical of the genre, instead creating a story of love and loss that is moving and powerful.My one criticism of the series is that it is perhaps too long drawn out. A trilogy would have sufficed, but that should not refelct badly on this book which is excellent as it stands."
2,Sloppy pitch correction on some pieces,"Terrific violinist, lots of great and not so well known interesting repertoire, but some music is a half step flat, (not that everyone will care), but to me, it does change the sound significantly."
4,A book with much to recommend it,"This is an interesting, articulate novel which just about fits into the space-opera subgenre, I think. It has a cast of dozens, if not hundreds, but the two main characters are compelling enough to make up for the (few, infrequent) points where my attention wandered. Shiny space-battles, with just enough tech description to be understandably believeable and not enough to bore. And it has politics. Complicated politics.Also, fascinating look at the social problems caused by a wealthy, immortal (undead) elite for their still-living compatriots.I enjoyed this book. It's space opera that assumes you do, actually, have a functioning brain."
3,Not without flaws,"I liked this book, though I'm not in a hurry to grab the next one. As much as I love Westerfeld's writing, being manipulated irritates me and the end of this book is a cliffhanger that neglects to answer basic questions posed in the book, questions that I felt really should have been answered."
1,Half a book,"Unless you're willing to buy at least another book don't bother buying this. It really does end in the middle of the story. Imagine the movie ""Independence Day""... Now imagine it ending right as Will Smith took off in the alien ship... That's this bookThe book was decent but not worth the $20 in order to get both books."
3,Half a story does not good value make.,"This book doesn't really stand out amongst it's peers, although it manages to hold its own up to a point. That point is in the middle of the story, which just happens to be the end of the book. This could not stand on its own under any circumstance. If it were 1500 pages, like Hamilton's Night's Dawn books, that might be excusable but as each of the first two books in this series are barely 300 pages, it seems that either the publisher and/or the author are taking advantage of the buying public. The most annoying aspect is that all the really good parts of this story are in the second book so my advice would be to skip this and go straight to KILLING OF WORLDS. It has enough of a brief in the prologue to get you up to speed."
4,Amazingly quick and easy read,"Space Opera, or sci-fi for that matter, is not my usual fare, but I wanted something different, and drawn by the books cool cover (yeah, silly I know), I picked this up. What a surprise! This book is a true page turner, with short, almost movie like scenes flipping from character to character and scene to scene. It was filled with tons of sci-fi techno jargon, BUT it didnt slow the story or make it hard to read (as I said, not my usual).The interesting, and yet, scary thing for me was how much of this technology is not only possible in the far future, but I can see much of this happening in the near future. Mr Westerfeld's ideas are not that outlandish or quasi-science. He clearly researched this book meticulously to ensure it held a realist feel, and that only adds to the books depth. I found myself wondering later if this was what the future holds for us.I highly recommend this book and it's sequel to anyone wanting an easy sci-fi read."
2,Half a book,"This might have been fun. Instead, it stands as an example of the worst kind of attempt to double sales by marketing half a book at a time.The elements of adventure and political intrigue are present. By the end of the book, however, only one lame subplot has been resolved. The end result is an entirely unsatisfying read and a sense that your time has been wasted by a marketing gimmick.I'm sure TOR expects us to come back, but it wasn't all that compelling in the first place. This consumer's dollars will go to a book that I can enjoy as a complete work. Maybe it's time for all sci-fi readers to demand at least that much consideration."
2,Decent half a book,"While I am rating this book as only 2 stars I firmly believe once the second is released and combined they will make a great four star book. That being said this is a book that only starts to get interesting only to abruptly end in the middle of a battle of all things.While I love serial books and have no objection to having to wait for a second to see how it turns out I didn't expect to be buying half a product at the price it is being sold at.That being said the story IS interesting in only seeing how death is perhaps the one thing that actually motivates us to ""making life just a little better"" and the end result of a system where death is no longer a concern. Would we stagnate? Would we become something else? Hard to say but the true level is probably yet to be revealed.To me it was less sci-fi and more opera which in this day and age isn't a bad thing at all but the jarring end still grates on you."
4,A Great Family History Novel,"I really enjoyed this book, and Arliss Ryan's writing is very good. This book spans one family's history over 150 years, as it relates to the house they lived in. As with any family there were eccentric people, lovable people, interesting people and funny people, as well as the ""family black sheep"". Ms Ryan develops her characters very well, and you can tell that she is writing about people she is familiar with. For anyone who likes to read about a specific family's life over the span of a century or more, please read this book."
4,Powerful enough but a little...,"This saw does the job for metal cutting but it is a little light in the base frame area and the rubber feet are rather light duty. Watch for them, they fall off fairly easy. I put some ""Goop"" on them to keep in place. Also arrived slightly damaged due to inadaquate packaging and the rough handling from UPS. This seems to be a popular theme with UPS as several other items they have delivered arrived damaged. It appears that perhaps they start throwing them out of the planes and/or trucks before they come to a complete halt??!! In all fairness , UPS is not the only one at fault. Companies [Hitachi, Jet, etc] need to wake up to the fact that you cannot send an item like a chop saw or a midi-lathe etc. in flimsy boxes with less than acceptable packing foam,and cardboard that is way too thin. Amazon should get on there case!"
4,Great Chop Saw,"Recipient is knowledgeable regarding tools, and he was thrilled with this gift! We were thrilled with the price and the quick delivery."
5,G.D.M.F.S.O.B.!!!!,"If you can find this you need this!!!!Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill The Peace Now!!! Do It Now!!They won't let me put 6 stars :("
5,THANK YOU!! =D,"thank you, you helped me so much. I really couldn't afford to spend a lot of money on it, and you really made my life a lot easier. Thank you so much!"
4,Good Condition,It was exactly as advertized and it was delivered in a timely manner. Overall a good expirence. Would order from the seller again.
3,Good despite a couple of flaws,"After finally getting this unit due to back-order problems this past summer it appears manufacturing is a bit rushed. The instructions for the drywall ceiling installation are incorrect in stating that a 3/8"" bit should be used for the pilot hole. As the bolts themselves are 3/8"" you'll have to be smarter than me or plan on a second set of holes. Also, the first bolt I screwed into the ceiling snapped while tightening -- and I'm no Joe Weider. Lastly, on one of the bolts, the machining was just off such that I couldn't get the socket over the head and had to use a wrench.After finally getting the hoist installed the hooks, straps, cable and pulleys all work very well. But I'd suggest getting better hardware and remember to check your pilot hole drill bit first against your bolt."
2,200 lb Garage Hoist System,"It was listed as a ""200 lb"" garage hoist system but the one I received stated on the box and instructions that it was actually a ""100 lb"" system."
4,Gear Up Hoist exaclly what I needed,"I needed to hang two kayaks in my garage. I previously used another brand hoist for my bikes, but it was too flimsy for the kayaks. The Gear Up Deluxe set (120 lb limit) was just right and a good price. I did substitute larger lag screws for the ones provided to secure the hoist brackets to the ceiling joists. For safety, I also installed a homemade backup rope attachment to secure the kayaks when they are suspended at the ceiling. I would do that with any hoist system. I would recommend this set."
3,n88rh framing nailer,"well thought out design with nice balance and a great depth of drive adjustment.plenty of power.to bad it jams so much using sheathing nails.I have owned the gun for over a year, sent it back to the manufacture because of jamming problems and they installed a new magazine. didn't help,recoil causes back nail strip to jam on front strip and won't let nails feed properly.some brands of nails work better than others, but still very frustrating."
4,Does exactly what it is supposed to...,"Let's face it, the Marware protection pack is the only way to go to protect your Mac. The ""bubbles"" other reviewers mention work out easily and I have had no problem with residue - but why would you want to take it off anyway? For the price, you just can beat this set; it looks great on my MBP and keeps the wrist area clean and free from scratches."
1,look at all the pretty bubbles...not.,"Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles. If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you. The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard. So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back. My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster."
4,Larger display of most items really helps.,"If you want a sleep vibration alarm that doesn't awaken your partner, this is an excellent product. It's an improvement over an earlier model that has a hard to read, tiny display. There's still an important shortcoming on the new ""large"" display. Considering that many people may use this with its multiple vibration alarms to alert them to take medications, many of them may be elderly. It's a shame that the AM/PM display is still tiny. What were the designers thinking?"
4,Primal Sabbath,"Sure, this CD is a little rough around the edges, but it offers a stunning ""official"" look into Sabbath live and at the prime of their career. I thought that many of the songs were outstanding compared to the studio tracks, such as ""Sweet Leaf"" and ""Killing Yourself to Live"". ""Killing Yourself to Live"" is much better here than on Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath. Also, the ""Wicked World"" jam is unbelievable, and Iommi just confirms his supernatural power over the guitar.As my title insinuates, the recording is not up to today's standards, but the whole feel of the CD just adds to the mystique and power. I have only one complaint, and perhaps question. On my Castle remastered CD, at about 2:09 minutes into ""Paranoid"" there is a noticable pop in the sound. I was just wondering if this is true for all or if mine just is sub-par. I would appreciate any responses."
4,Black Sabbath - 'Live At Last' (Enigma),"I remember when this first came out on lp.Every Sabbath fan that I knew ended up buying a copy of it.Within like two years,you could find it on the $1.99 rack.Now,it's been faithfully reissued on CD.Great!Now we don't have to worry about wearing down the vinyl pressing.Prime live Sabbath to be fully experienced here.Tunes I liked best were ""Sweet Leaf"",""Snowblind"" and the ""Wicked World/Supernaut/Drum&Guitar Solo"" medley.A should-have for all Sabbath fans.OZZY!! OZZY!!"
3,Live at Last,"After Ozzy left Sabbath and was replaced by Dio, Live at Last surfaced. It is a live recording, recorded in about 73?. The sound quality is fair, I wouldn't spend too much money on this cd, but it is cool to have a live release besides the reunion album. You can find this from Power Sound or Nems pretty cheap, and if you find it cheap pick it up! This is also part of the ""Past Lives"" cd release, which includes a second disc of live material."
4,Everybody stand up and go CRAZY!!!,"I'll be honest with you...I just bought this CD for about $3 at a clearance sale and I wasn't expecting much. I'm not even sure I'd even heard of this album before but I figured what the hell? Well, I am about one minute into track 3 and I am in my glory. It's taking me right back to the last Sab show I saw a couple years ago. I think it's pretty much the same set too! I have seen Sabbath about 5 times and they are definitely my favorite band to see live. And I have been to a lot of shows my friends.This is a pretty good record of the band in their prime. As some other reviewers have noted, the sound quality is raw, and yes, somewhat like a cleaned-up bootleg, but that's all part of the appeal for me. A+"
2,The quality of this cd could be better,"If you can find the Nems cd or record you are better off.The cd on the castle label is not as good. The intro has been cut, and the sound quality is muddy"
5,Feedback is coming from outer space to kill you,"Each song on this CD begins with a one-second screech of feedback that sounds like Yog Soggoth or some other being from the outer edges of the universe. Other than that the album is ""just"" Black Sabbath songs played very well (the ones that come off best are ""War Pigs,"" ""Tomorrow's Dream,"" and ""Killing Yourself to Live""). The jam on ""Wicked World"" is good too.I have the NEMS version of this album, so I can't vouch for the sound quality of the Castle release or the other one offered for sale by Amazon."
1,Simply awful...,"I hate to say anything this badabout a Sabbath cd. But as anobjective reviewer I have no choice. This is terrible! The band, with the exception of Iommi, is not in their best shape. Ozzy is just horrendous, worse than I've everheard him sound live from back in the '70's. Just about any bootlegfrom this era is far better than this disc.Don't bother with this unless you just have to have it to complete your Sabbath collection, and make sure you buy it last.Thats what the title must mean!"
3,a reprint,"A word to the wise: this book was originally published in 1982 as NO MORE DREAMS. I bought it used and haven't yet read it, but I needed to give it some stars to submit this."
2,Ironically about integrity-but not the publisher's,"The theme of this book is integrity. Rather odd, considering that the book has been put together in a rather questionable way. The book was apparently published previously under a different title in 1982, but has been edited some (to include such things as references to the Internet to make it some more modern). Somebody other than William Coughlin did this, presumably, since Mr. Coughlin has passed on. As in the case of another recently published ""Coughlin"" book, the publisher is apparently unhappy that Coughlin is not around to write new books and has decided to fill this gap in other ways. The editing was done very sloppily and the book is riddled with typos. The book does not have much of a plot but is reasonably well written and some of the characters are interesting."
1,Grossly misleading,"William Coughlin was one of the finest writers of legal thrillers around and I have always enjoyed his books very much. When two years ago The Judgement was published I assumed it was done posthumously, but still written by the author himself.This is certaily not the case for The Court. Yes, I know that it is based on one of his earlier novels, but the many references to the Internet, the Reagan years, the Clinton administration and so on cannot, of course, have been written by William Coughlin.I think it is a very sick marketing policy of the publishers to refrain from ANY refernece on the cover that in fact the book has been written and/or edited by somebody else.I hope this will stop quickly!"
1,The Court,"Very rarely do I not finish reading a book. But after enduring all the confusing references and typos, I got to page 150. They changed the characters name from Jefferson to Jackson without missing a beat. If the publishers won't bother to proof read their books, I won't finish this one, or buy any more from this publisher."
5,Another great Coughlin book.,"From someone who has read the book. Mr. Coughlin wrote some of the best, and this is one of them. I would hope we will see more of his out-of-prints republished. His greatest, to me, was ""The Twelve Apostles"", an outstanding book."
2,first time reading William Coughman,"I found it difficult to stick with this book in the beginning. I actually had trouble staying awake but I was glad that I did stick with it. About midway through, it became more interesting and I enjoyed the ending. I am more of a Grisham or a Scottoline fan."
3,Good technology book. Limited theory,"As an instructor, I appreciated the readable style of this book, and would recommend it as a primer for ArcView 3.x; however, I did have concerns. As I read, I could only agree with many statements if I replaced ""GIS"" in the text with ""ArcView 3.x."" Readers should be aware that other products (current and potential) approach the technology differently than it is presented in this book."
4,Not bad for an intro to GIS,"This book seems like it would work for an intro class to GIS anywhere from the middle school to the college level (I used it for a graduate level intro course). For the most part, it does a good job introducing broad, central, concepts in GIS without getting too technical or bogged down with detail.That being said, it also doesn't offer a whole lot to sink your teeth into. Some of the parts are painfully outdated, too. After reading some of the stuff about the advent of the new fandangled world-wide web, I had to check the copyright date. AOL?? Really? I also felt like it did a bad job introducing database concepts. Regardless of these flaws, it does work as an intro text. I am now on the 'Thematic Cartography and Geovisualization' text in the series, and I'm hoping it will be a little more useful."
2,messy,"As an ""introduction"" to GIS this book is muddled. It will begin an explanation very simply and then jump off the deep end, going into complicated, erratic explanations."
2,Simplicity is much needed...,"Simplicity is much needed, and much needed, for an intro that is. Any regular person new to the field of GIS (Geographic Information Systems) would find that this text, though containing lots of information, is poorly written and definately makes the beautiful art and/or science of GIS seem rather lumbersome. The author is clumsy, and often goes into tangents - that only those in the field would already be familiar with. I gave this text/book two stars, instead of one, cause the author does make an honest attempt to explain the subject matter, but falls short of making it a good intro."
3,Better than the prior few -- Sad ending for Cerebus,"The strengh of this book is with the exception of the opening section which is mainly text invovling a reinterpetation of various religous texts stemming from the prior books ,the rest of this is actually comics. The weakness is the pacing as Sim goes over and over Cerebus's various alilments in a redundent fashion. Cerebus in this book is essentially an aging powerful religous/political figure trapped in his own home. A sad ending to the series - tyhe final section involving his death however is beautifully drawn"
3,What can I say?,"I will not comment on the opening text, only to say that I DID read all of it.For the ""comic"" portion, we see the consequences of Cerebus' decision to fall in love with a woman who looks astonishingly like Jaka and is only referred to as ""New Joanne."" There is both humor and sadness in this final chapter, and, as the other reviewers have said, Cerebus dies. But what happens after death? We get to see that as well. This may not be the end; there's always the chance that Cerebus could (metaphorically) become a neutrino and escape, but I said I wasn't going to comment on the text portion."
5,THE LAST DAY AT LAST,"...i was first introduced to Cerebus back in 1987 (when i was still in high school) from a friend who let me read a few of his back issues. I quickly became quite the ""Cerebus fanatic"" buying up all the issues i could find. Eventually i bought a couple of the phone books ""church and state"" ""high society"" and was blown away by the creative genius of Sim in both his storytelling and his almost ""animation cell"" like artwork (thanks to his background artist Gerhard)......as the story progressed and the pacing slloooowed down...somewhere around Jakas Story... i figured i would stop buying the individual issues and just wait for all of the phone books.... and 18 years later here they are!!!!!! One of the greatest tales (in 16 volumes) ever to appear in graphic form!!!!"
4,Classic styling,"While searching for some plain, but pretty, slipcovers I realized this was a near impossible task until I found these. The fabric is a bit ""soft"" so it doesn't press out quite as firm as I'd like but they are neutral in color and classic in style so you can use them with almost any decor. They don't have that awful country look like so many other slip covers. I would definitely buy these again."
3,just okay,"This item is ok , it fits just fine but the fabric is too thin especially for ""cotton duck"". I would not buy this product again but I will keep it because it works fine for my use."
2,Too pricey for the quality,"Maybe my expectations got in the way. I ordered the dining room chair cover. Usually dining chair covers are made of thick material to withstand being sat on, pulled by behinds, repositioned, stained, etc. This chair cover is made of fabric that could be used for regular clothes, and will not last long on a chair. For the price, I expected a strong chair cover, not something that I could sew together from regular fabric."
1,and it started of so great...,"We've used this product before at a previous home and it was excellent. There is no better faux finish than with this roller and marble sponges. So, we order it for our new home to paint the living room. It started out so beautiful, just like we remembered, then it happened. About a quarter way into the process, the handle broke from the bar that holds the rollers. I ty-wrapped and taped it back on so we could finish the job. Then, about a half hour later, one of the rollers popped off, broken on the inside. At that point I had to go to HD and get two small roller handles. We had to finish the job two-handed. It looks ok, but the original rig was junk. I was going to return it all, but it ended up in the trash instead. They just don't make em like they used to!"
2,Broke after one use,"Flimsy frame, broke in half before the room was finished using regular (not thick) paint!"
2,It broke in half after the first wall,"It would have been wonderful had it not broken after only one wall. I was amazed at how beautiful our Dining Room was starting to look. The kit and the video were very helpful and the way the first wall came out was amazing. However, the double roller head broke off of the handle right as we were getting done the first wall. There was no way to fix it at all. So with 3 walls left and some quick thinking, I put the 2 roller covers on a regular old single paint roller. It was a lot harder to work with, but it got the job done. The roller that came with the kit made the work on the first wall so easy. My advice would be to buy more then one roller from the start (or that the manufacturer design a stronger roller). The handle really did just snap right off. We would have finished the room in half the time had we not run in to this problem."
1,Very Disappointed,"I have had this item sitting on a shelf waiting for me to use it for months so it is too late to return it or request a refund but I certainly would if I could. I had a lot of square feet to cover when I used this product. I had one 8 foot wall done and moved to the next. I was only about 6 feet along when the handle just snapped right off! It is metal so it isn't something I could pop back on - it was just broken off and that was that. What to do?! I had no choice but to finish the room (VERY large room) by rolling the end piece by hand! The effect was the same but the work was SO MUCH MORE DIFFICULT! Also, the tray that holds the paint has a divider for the colors that is only about 3/4"" deep - what's up with THAT?! I remember using this product years ago when it was all the rage and it seemed to be a much better product then. I wouldn't have used this technique at all (it's a bit dated) but I am going for a Tuscan decor in my home. I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Wall magic dual roller kit and marble dual roller covers,Great product. I use satin or eggshell finish paint and the marble dual rollers. Uses very little paint. I have a large tuscan style kitchen and the effect mimics a professional Venetian plaster application. If applied to a paintable pebble textured wall covering the results are even more authentic and dramatic. I used pale taupe and earth brown on my kitchen and light gold and dark gold on my friend's kitchen.
4,Its good but...,"The roller is very good even for the novice and if you are an experienced painter you can do excellent things BUT there are no corner sponges with the same pattern. Kinda lame if you ask me. When this thing was sold at Home Depot (and by the way, their paint SUCKS so don't waste your time and money) it came with all the fix'ns to put a smile on your face. Hope this helps."
3,No PLAY-ALL feature,"While this 50th anniversary collection is fine, and I certainly enjoyed many of the original sponsor spots, the lack of a PLAY-ALL feature means that you can't just turn on the DVD and let it go. You must start each episode individually."
5,The Andy Griffith Show 50th Anniversary,"I bought this one basically to get the ""Danny Thomas"" show. Where it all began. I have all the other seasons, but wanted the one that started it all. My collection is complete now."
4,Comments Re: Book Titled Fame At Last,"I am very impressed with the time spent to research the subject matter. The authors obviously had the perserverance and energy to devote a significant number of hours to the data collection and analysis phases.Since I like history, I particularly liked the interesting items about indiviiduals that I have read or heard of in other media. There are some lessons to be learned from the lives of the people included in the book.Also, the statistics bring out some interesting points regarding education, field of endeavor (Occupational Groups)and differences between the sexes and races. For example, the list of names in Table 1-4, ""The Overall Apex of Fame: The Longest Obituarties,"" remind one of the people that have gone before us and have made a difference.The authors are to be congratulated for providing a great read of a subject that some people shun. (Personally, I get up each morning, check the local obits and if my name is not included I go to work)"
2,surprisingly not that great...,"i love these girly books, i admit it. however, this one isn't worth it. it's predictable (every time something ""bad"" happens, it turns out to be a 3's company-esque misunderstanding that you can see coming a mile away) and boring. also, i know this may sound ridiculous, but for young professional women like me who love to indulge in this kind of mindless reading, the bright pink cover and ridiculous title left me too embarrassed to read the book on the subway or even keep it near the top of my bag."
3,3 Stars is Generous,"This was my first Sue Margolis book, and I must say, I was somewhat disappointed. The plot was predictable and the characters seemed more like charicatures. The book was funny in places, but the humorous spots were few and far between. I just couldn't relate to the protagonist, Rebecca, at all. The sex scenes, while raunchy, were sort of ho-hum for me - too predictable. The chick lit genre is tired and chiched and is in desperate need of fresh, innovative writing and characters. And this novel just doesn't provide."
3,Not Margolis' Best,"After reading Spin Cycle, I was eager to read Apocalipstick. There are some similarities with the two novels such as the author's excellent portrayal of her characters, semi-graphic sex scenarios, and predictable ending. If you're a big fan of the recent 'chick-lit' craze, you'll like this book. It's a fast read, perfect for plane travel or a beach trip."
1,Only if you're obsessed with your bum!,This book is beyond mildy boring. It's easy to spot the 'plot twists' several chapters before they occur. All her jokes center around one-theme that isn't funny from the start. I recommend it only if you're looking for a cheap read that doesn't require any thinking. I was very disappointed.
4,"Bought it for the cover art, stayed for the story","I picked this up just because the cover looked vaguely funny (I know, I know, judging a book by its cover and all). I don't know quite what I expected, but the book definitely drew me in. I started reading it and couldn't put it down, even as it passed my bedtime... First off, it's obviously written by someone English, or at least, someone emulating the English writing style You just have to love any book that talks about ""snogging."" But the story was good, if a bit sexually explicit. I'd say it's definitely an R-rated book! I really did like the main character, and thought she had a lot of personality. The only thing I didn't like is that is was a very... happy book, when all was said and done. None of her wild, pessimistic views ever turned out to be true, and I just didn't see that as realistic. But I don't think that it was intended to be any sort of realistic story, so, taking it with a grain of salt I'd say it was a fluffy, entertaining read."
1,Worst book I ever read,"I have never written a book review before, but after reading this title I felt compelled. I would not wish this poorly written, waste of time on anyone. I enjoyed the ""Shopoholic"" series of books and I expected this one to be along those line. This book was a direct rip-off of that series, right down to the main character being named Rebecca. The big difference however, was that this book was juvenile, predictable and downright boring! This book is a waste of the paper it was printed on. I would give it no stars if I could."
3,Not up to her usual standard,"I enjoyed the two previous novels by the author (Neurotica and Spin Cycle), which were frothy and funny, but the characters in this book are cartoonish - it's impossible to suspend your disbelief and see the book as anything but a fiction...chick lit can combine wit and a real story, but here the author is just painting by numbers.Disappointing."
3,"Cute, but predictable","This was a cute book and a quick read. This was another book about a British Heroine looking for the love of her life and finding it- but not without a few bumps along the way. Some of the plot twists were really far fetched. But in the end, it was a fun feel good story."
3,Hmm,"I read Neurotica recently by this author and thought it was first rate and was desperate to read everything by her. Turns out Apocalipstick is a rather flat follow up. The protaganist is not very believable and as for the plot about a face cream that makes people go crazy and could cause a world war ... well, it's flat out stupid. I kept reading this because I thought it would improve. It's not terrible exactly, just a tad lacklustre. Where Neurotica could be compared to a freshly roasted chicken stuffed with fresh herbs, Apocalipstick is merely a reconstituted chicken nugget."
2,Just okay,"A quick, easy read, it was okay. Everything just flows along, and the characters were a little too one-dimensional, all nice and perfect. In the end everything just sort of magically works out and everyone gets what they want with no real effort."
1,want to read a bad sitcom?,"Classic case of inventing a catchy, oh-so-cute title, then inventing a story to go with it. As usual, with painful results. The author ought to be writing sitcoms, because she shouldn't be writing books in sitcom style. They're rather different media, sitcoms and books, but the author is blissfully unaware of this. The heroine is not very likable, and the neurotics around her are over the top -- too, too much. When you have no real story, create neurotic supporting characters, that's the rule isn't it? Skip this one, do something else with your life."
2,platter not correct size,the platter and bowl are very nice however the platter is only 12 inches not 16 as the description stated
3,Disappointed - Wrong Product Description,"Product Description lists the platter as 16"". It is a 12"" platter.The vegetable bowl is very small. Almost the same size as the salad bowl that comes with the place setting. The 16"" platter and larger bowl are available separately, but for a much higher cost."
3,Nails are not 3-1/2 inches long; Shorter than a 16D.,"These nails are 1/8"" shorter than the advertised length. They are 3-3/8"" long. May not be a big deal to some, but they are not the same size as a standard 16D nail, which I expected. Otherwise, quality of nails seems decent and they worked fine in my Bostitch F21PL."
1,b @ c nails,nail qaulity was good. way to much money for 500 nails. can buy 2000 for double the price. check around internet before you buy!!!!
1,I don't know!,I can not review this item until I recieve the air nailer ordered Mar 14 that may be sent sometime in July. Thank you Jack Wheeler
4,"3-1/2 inch, 22 degree Round Head Galvanized Nail","3-1/2 inch, 22 degree Round Head Galvanized Nails were not available in any of the home improvement chain stores. Amazon came through again. Nails worked perfect in the Porter Cable framing nailer."
5,worked great,would buy again because it worked in nail gun and you could buy smaller quantities. used in Husky nail gun
2,"not enough detail, too much justification","this is an interesting book, but maddening in providing too little detail, and too much snide comment about the traditional swing. also, there is far too much blathering about 'supination', 'coronal plane', and other arcane jargon. the author should explain why the address should be 12inches behind the ball, and why the club cannot be properly held in a finger grip"
1,Disappointed with content,"After buying and reading this book I was left with the feeling I purchased an info-mercial. I would have appreciated more instructional material and less sales pitch about why this golf swing techinique, along with the special clubs that should be used, is the only true answer to improving at golf. In my opinion the author went overboard in bashing other approaches to the golf swing when more pages could have been devoted to explaining and demonstrating this system."
1,Review of original 1964 Signet edition.,"Starswarm is not one of Aldiss' better works. If you have enjoyed his other works and like reading far-future speculation, this is a book for you"
2,ADJUSTABLE?!*?!*!,It IS sturdy. But it is majorly hard to adjust. I finally made it unadjustable by accident while trying to adjust it! There must be better.
3,Tough to adjust...,"Works, once you get it in the position you want. VERY difficult to adjust. I accidentally made mine impossilbe to adjust, when trying to adjust it. Sturdy, not very attractive, except to the cats who liked scratching on the stiff carpet part. Finally they peed on it, they knew it was broken!"
2,could be better,"The battery works great! I used to only be able to use my fully charged phone until about 7pm at night before it would die and now this battery keeps the charge for about 24 more hours (and I use my phone A LOT!). The only thing negative I have to say is that the door does not stay on securely. This means that the battery doesn't stay plugged in. So my phone has turned off several times: when I'm on the phone, when I put down the phone, when I have the phone loose in my purse... And it's not like I can tape or glue or anything!So yeah, great battery but crappy door."
2,battery,"this battery don't hold its value at all. Wish I didn't purchased it. I do not talk alot nor do I text alot, and still went dead within 5hrs"
1,BEWARE !!!! ROTTEN PRODUCT,This battery is WORTHLESS. Brand new EXTENDED battery does not even last for ONE DAY without calling anyone. My THREE year old NON extended battery last longer.Do NOT purchase this battery unless you want to be disappointed.
5,A great battery,"When I got this I didn't have much faith in a 9 dollar battery, but when I got it and gave it a run through...and it worked flawlessly, just like a Samsung labeled battery would work....If your looking for an extended battery for a Samsung a900....This is the battery to get...."
1,Worked for a short time,"This battery worked fine for a few months. Then it's charge time started to dwindle. Before long, I was back to the unacceptable amount of charge time I had with my standard battery, just a few hours.I tried to contact BargainCell to see if they would replace the battery and I did not get a response. Bad customer service!I found that you can buy the same ""Made In China"" battery on eBay for much less, so if I'm going to have to buy one every 4-6 months, I might as well get them as inexpensively as possible."
3,Great life but...,"This battery has great life, but I found that the battery doesn't fit snug and will move disconnecting the battery form the phone. It will occasionally reset the handset."
3,Abominog sides three and four,"This album stays the course set by the previous release Abominog: slickly-produced hard guitar rock augmented by liberal use of synths and with a few odd cover versions. Not quite as strong as Abominog, but if you liked that one you'll want to have this one also."
2,Err...,"With the exception of ""Abominog"", the 1980s were unfortunately not a productive decade for Uriah Heep. This is the second-worst album of their career (which, even more unfortunately, was followed by their worst, ""Equator""). Mick and the boys fall prey to all the worst tendencies of 80s cheese-rock here, and there's simply no excuse for covering a Bryan Adams song. Avoid this one."
2,"Radio, radio, we wanna radio airplay!!","IN this one, Heep gave up writing intelligent hard rock stuff and went for a final assault to America, writing cheesy lyrics and songs all the way. But this line up was so talented thateven this way a lot of the songs sounded good and hard."
1,This is not Uriah Heep...,"Uriah Heep was dead with the release of Wonderworld...""Head First"" is an abomination"
1,URIAH HEEP GOING FOR THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL...,"By 1981, everybody tought Uria Heep was gone for sure. So, surprinsingly, they came with ex-OZzy Obourne men Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake and release a strong, well focused hard-rock album, ABOMINOG. That album clearly had a commercial/pop edge to it, with more and more lyrics dealing about the subject of ""love""... But, even so, that album had a parituclar edge to it, some great vibe. But in HEAD FIRST, they stepped the commercialism a lot of grades higher, making a totally pop / hair metal / mainstream composition, clearly succumbing to pressures from the record company, like so many matal band did in the eighties... This album is a sell out by Heep, nothing less than that."
2,Bath Soak,This product is supposed to help relieve sinus congestion. It has a pleasant aroma but doesn't appear to help any. You also have to use a lot for each soaking so you only get a few.
4,A rare beauty!!,"I bought this CD for the Kozeluch concerto. I first heard the Kozeluch Bassoon concerto on radio in 1995 (an LP recording) and was captivated by it. As I understand, this piece has only ever been recorded 3 times. This is the only recording I know on CD and it's a gem. It was also very difficult to find a supplier of this CD. Thanks Amazon!!To my amateur ears the Bach concertos are more in the Vivaldi Italianate style, while the Kozeluch concerto is more in a Viennese classical style. All three are very enjoyable listening.The balance between the soloist and the orchestra is good.The bassoon is such an underrated instrument. I love its texture and tonal range. If you love bassoon music then I highly recommend this CD."
4,Great camera,"This camera is everything it says .This is 4 my teenage daughter and you all know how picky they can be,have to have everything work perfect or it gets returned,We have purchased 3 different camera during a 2 week period and this none is a keeper.GOOD NEWS though.We purchased at walmart And regular price for the EXACT camera is $109.97 7.0 megapixles/2.5 lcd monitor with ac adaptor and usb..Great deal considering how much they are asking here for the same item...."
2,Loose Screws,"I bought this camera for around 99 dollars from Walmart. I wasn't expecting much, but about a week after I got it, I noticed a screw missing from the back panel. a few months later, all but the bottommost screw are gone. Additionally, the flash and white balance really suck. It does take SOME photos decent enough to end up on Facebook, so that's why I gave it two stars."
1,Junk,"Did not work out of the box. call the 800 number that comes up on the screen and get an audio tutorial on some procedure I never got to try - no option to talk to a human AT ALL - try it 1-800-421-6382 - listen for your self, try to ask a question! email customer service told me to shut it off and turn it back on again - the problem is it shuts its self off and won't charge!!!!"
1,Great tunes - Don't download,"The music contained on this album is fantastic. Unfortuntely, there is a problem with the mp3 download. The last track ""I Can't Do Without You"" is seriously messed up. I would buy the cd that has both Clarence Carter albums ""Testifyin"" and ""This Is Clarence Carter"" on it."
3,"Keyboard is OK,. but the mouse is a pain!","I purchased this keyboard for the large letters on the keys and so far it has been good, but the mouse is a real pain in the butt. You have to reboot it every time you start the computer. You don't have to do this to the keyboard. Sometimes you have to do it over and over again to get it to work. The mouse profile is narrow, so if you have big hands it is a little small. Sadly there is not a lot of the large letter keyboards out there to choose from."
1,Wireless Visikey Keyboard,"The keyboard arrived promptly but the Q,A,Z, and 1,4,7 keys did not work. I contacted Amazon for an RMA, printed out a shipping label and was promptly refunded. The return process was so easy I decided to buy the USB wired version of the Visikey keyboard which also arrived promptly. I'm very pleased with my new, wired keyboard.Amazon was great but I have to give the product 1 star because it did not work right."
1,Flimsy,"It's conceivable that this knife set can be used as ancillary option; say for a college dorm room, camping, first apartment and so on. However, don't plan to use these in your kitchen, as they are flimsy at best; barely useful. Don't let the colored handles fool you, there's nothing here worth purchasing."
4,We need to see 1980s Jazz Butcher re-released.,"I am trying very hard to locate any recordings of 1980s Jazz Butcher, especially the release containing ""Heavy Drinking"" and ""The Devil is My Friend."" The only copy I've ever seen (heard) was stolen! Please re-release this stuff. If you can't find it on Amazon.com, where can it be?"
2,Not worth the money,Love ths vacuum but felt as though I needed a better attachment for my rugs. This really is no better than the attachment that comes with it for the rugs. A very expensive attachment that does not do the job very well.
1,"stopped working, short warranty","We purchased this as a supplement to our Miele canister vacuum to help pick up dog hair. It was an expensive attachment but we assumed that a Miele appliance would be high quality and would carry a warranty. Wrong. It worked fine until it stopped working, less than 5 months from purchase. The warranty is 90 days through the Amazon retailer-- for a piece of equipment that cost $130.00. What a terrible waste of money, and a thoroughly disappointing encounter w/ the Amazon retailer. If you're going to have to replace an attachment every year, better make sure you buy an inexpensive one, not this one."
3,It does the job.,I knew it wouldn't be the most powerful attachment as it is air driven. But it does pick the pet hair like I wanted it to!
2,My wife doesn't even use it.,"I bought my wife her dream vacuum, a meila. It is worth every penny I paid for it. Which were a lot of pennies! I also bought her this attachment to help with the rugs in the house but she doesn't use it. We have hard wood, tile and berber carpet on the floors and she said the vacuum work fine without the attachment. So save your money for vacuum bags."
4,Don't Need It,"If you are looking at this, you have probably bought a Miele vacuum cleaner like we did. Our house is about half tiles and the other half carpeted. We decided to purchase this attachment for use on the carpet. After several use, I have to say that I could do without it. The one that came with the vacuum cleaner is more than adequate for both tiles and carpet. I can not tell the difference between the two and it is too much of a hassle to stop and swap out. So if you are considering....save yourself some money and stick with the one that came with the unit; you are not missing out on anything."
2,Not worth it,I have the Polaris which was worth every penny. It is fantastic on my hardwood floors and Persian rugs. However I have two high pile rugs I thought I would get the Turbo attachment for and it was not worth it. Not at all. The rotating brush is week and did not leave a nice pattern on my rug and certainly did not do a better job than the attachment on my existing machine. It was a mediocre upgrade at best and not worth the money charged.
4,A Combat Infantryman in ww11,"An up front view of actual combat, it It is the few in number of a rifle company that do the actual fighting. What it feel like to face the enemy twenty four hours a day, like facing a firing squad. Go thru three phases physical and mental strain. Scared out of your wits, hatred of the enemy when your close comrades get killed, wishing you would actually get a wound that would send you back to get some rest It behoves the new replacement to learn the tricks of the trade in staying alive. Like there are the Quick and the Dead. He's out to kill you and your had better get him first."
4,love the Clie,"I wanted something i could use as an e-book reader without spending the arm and leg that the e-reader companies want us to spend. The Clie is perfect for that. It's an older PDA so it's not that easy to find software other than the e-reading program i wanted but that's ok. It is doing exactly what i wanted it to do. Plus, the price was perfect. I think i paid $20."
4,slim pda,"I really like this product. I don't know how I survived without a PDA. This one is slim, light and has everything I needed. Easy to use, holds a charge for a long time. I getting one for my husband now."
2,Vastly disappointed,"I have a Palm 500 which I am very pleased with, so my wife wanted a PDA as well - she was persuaded by a silver-tongued salesman to buy the Clie instead - what a mistake!o- The screen is almost unreadable, even at optimum contrast and increasing the font size.o- The flip-top cover flips off more than on.o- The beam facility is incompatible with Palm.o- The jog roller is poorly positioned, making it uncomfortable to use.o- The up-down button is almost unusable.o- To switch on, put it in your pocket.So bad, she dumped it and bought a Palm instead."
2,Just Sent Mine Back,"Has a known ""design flaw"" according to sonystyle's tech support. The application buttons are raised and easily pressed by the soft cover, turning the unit on. I was constantly hearing it turning on in my pocket, purse, briefcase,--sometimes just picking it up. There is no locking mechanism to keep that from happening. Sony's customer service was the worst I've encountered. 45 minute wait times, only to get the runaround. They were very arrogant. Told me my choices were to send it back (at my expense) or buy a hardcover (also at my expense--$40). They'll probably charge me a restocking fee, they said. All for a known design flaw...The screen was also hard to read. Needless to say, I was EXTREMELY disappointed."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"It's not enough that this sprayer costs as much as it does, but Wagner has decided that you should pay them in order to continue to use this product after you buy it. How so? It is more than obvious to me that Wagner has purposely made a part in this machine called a ""swirl valve"" out of cheap plastic that wears out very, very quickly. Being a vital part, you must replace it- and they're expensive! This way the company continues to drain your wallet.It is also underpowered and will often ""spit"" the paint out instead of spraying it. It is best to just do it the old fashion way with rollers and brushes; it's cheaper, more efficient, and good exercise."
3,Works as advertized!,"Painting is an odieous task. Spraying or rolling painting simply blows.This painter, saves time and paint for outdoor projects or hall closets.I tried to use it for doing my house and it is too much work even doing an empty room means at least taping the carpets. For huge rooms stick to a roller, it is faster and neater.For closets this thing is worth it."
2,Have a lot of time ?,This product is fairly good quality but very slick . Not a good thing when you want a good grip . But most of all these are very very time CONSUMING ! OMG ! I spent two HOURS ! installing one of these ! ;-O You are threading a needle over and over through little holes and having to keep a tight tension all the way along ! You couldn't pay me to install another one of these ! They look really nice when your done though ;-)
1,Awful,"First off, I'm a fan of the Art Of Noise. This 'Collection' has perhaps a dozen notes (and I do mean NOTES, not bars, phrases, or songs) that are recognizable as Art of Noise. I might even give points for energy and dance but this album lacks even that. Pass on it!"
2,"I Wouldn't Pass Judgment, Except...","OK, I'm not a d&b fan, so I shouldn't be reviewing this item. However, they put the Art of Noise name on it, so I bought it (baaaa!). These songs may be good d&b, but they ain't good AON. I'm not sure what exactly is involved in these remixing projects, but apparently one goal is to remove anything that identifies the song. I'm told that this track is ""Peter Gunn"" and that track is ""Something Always Happens"". Sure, OK. As a huge fan of the originals, I shouldn't have to be told - but I need to be. They're remixed to the point that nothing's left. The beats are different, the speeds are different, the melodies are gone, the bass structures are different... exactly how are these remixes again? Why not original pieces by the artists listed? No matter. I'll give it two stars because, hey, this might be GOOD d&b, but it has absolutely no value to the AON fan who cares nothing for d&b."
3,A good drum & bass album,"This is a good album for drum and bass fans. However, if you're buying this strictly because you're an Art of Noise fan, you'll probably be disappointed. You can occasionally make out connections to the Art of Noise songs that are being massively remixxed and that is a special treat for someone like me. Also, at least one of the songs is too repetitive even for me."
2,This is not art.,Don't get me wrong... I do like d&b remixes and I love the art of noise but this album is more noise then art. When musicians rely on drum machines to make their music sound 'cool' this is what happens. There are a couple of exceptions on this album such as opus4 & peter gunn which must have taken effort and talent to create. However for the bulk of the rest of this album.... pllease!!
5,"Buy this for ""Drum and Bass"" not ""Art of Noise""","Awesome downtempo drum and bass CD. An old favorite that I am happy to have reunited with. I was shocked at the number of negative reviews, which seem predominately based on the fact that it doesn't sound like 'the art of noise.' If you like LTJ Bukem and the like you're going to enjoy this."
2,Disappointing,"C'mon guys. If you're going to do a d&b; track, at least take more than ten minutes to program it!There are several notable exceptions: ""Opus 4"" and ""Island"" are my personal favorites. But much seems phoned-in to me."
1,No Art of Noise Here!!!,"I agree with most of the others. This is NOT THE ART OF NOISE. The only song that even has AON in it is ""Something Always Happens"". The other songs are unrecognizable. The Art of Noise are AWESOME. If you like cool remixes of Art of Noise, don't get this CD!! But since it has AON on it, it is in my collection, which I have every Art of Noise CD, album and 12"" remixes made to date. HUGE FAN."
2,Hard to press buttons,"The button covers on either side are molded into the case and it is sometimes difficult to press them. If you are holding it in your right palm and attempting to press the power button, you have a good chance of also affecting the volume since you have to press so hard."
5,This is a very good book!!!,"The book, 100 Monologues, is etremely helpful when I had to choose a contemporary scene for my high school. It included a very funny scene about a man who had just finished eating a 72-ounce steak and other items of food. It is simply hilarious. It contains some very good character work and a variety of different roles to play. In the end, I would recomend this book to anyone who needs to find a solo scene."
1,Not if you want to get that part!,"If you are looking for an audition monologue, especially if you're a woman, keep looking. I've seen some lame monologue books, but I ended up using this one to light my living room fire. The supposed ""comedic"" monologues sometimes start off with promise, but then usually fly off to left field and always fall flat by the end. The ""serious"" ones don't really relate to the human experience as most of us know it, so if you use any Method acting at all, or want to move your auditors, forget it. There are decent monologue books out there. This isn't one of them."
3,Easy to read and a lot of variety,"I was pleasantly suprised to find at least four monologues from various plays my acting coach had recommended all in one book! As a struggling actress it comes in handy to have such variety between the cover of one book! I definitely enjoyed the fact that these weren't just random monologues, but they were from contemporary plays and playwrights. That alone gave me the ability to explore avenues I'd never thought of taking when auditioning. I recommend the book for anyone who likes variety and strength in content."
4,"Decent musical selection, good recordings","The primary reason I picked up this disk was for 'Talking to a Stranger', which is the only appearance of this version on CD. The recording is of high quality, which impressed me considering a lot of the original Mushroom Records recordings of Hunters & Collectors were pretty mediocre. The other track selections are quite good, although i don't know why they included 'Happy Birthday' which doesn't appear to be a very rare track. Nonetheless, I have enjoyed other SPG collections and this one doesn't disappoint."
4,Distilled Musical Goodness,"This CD contains some of my favorite tunes and will give you the urge to go look for the original albums. Two examples: ""It's My Life"" by Talk Talk and ""Wonderful Life"" by Black changed my tastes in music (for the better) permanently. Be warned, it might have the same effect on you."
3,"Great music, horrible DVD editing","I simply cannot believe that others have praised ""The great camera work...(No artistic flourishes, intrusive fades or flash camera work - but rather good, clear, crisp footage.)""They must have seen a different DVD from the one I watched. The camera work is good, the editing is horrendous. The editor did not allow a scene to ""settle"" for more than 5 seconds, in most cases 2 seconds or less. The incessant jumping from one camera angle to another is very irritating and robs the concert of any sense of flow and melodic character. It's as though it was edited by someone with a severe case of ADHD. For goodness sake, when Roine is cranking out a great lead run, let us SEE it, don't switch over to Neil fiddling with the knobs on his keyboard!Having said that, the music is quite good and the sound is good, not great. It is definitely worth owning, but I recommend you leave the monitor dark and simply enjoy the soundtrack - the video track is un-watchable...-RW-"
5,The Best of Transatlantic!,"I'm a fan, not much to say, a very very good quality music and production. A pity there is no blu-ray version."
2,"I don't have this disc, but...","I've heard most of the songs on it, and the only one that's really ""Sexy"" is ""So Alive"" by Love And Rockets."
4,Great Printer Quick,Setup was easy arrived quick downfall is not having flatbed to scan small items or page of book. fax works perfect arrived in New condtion even when it stated refurbished Great Buy!!One important fact must order printer cable it is special cable not standard USB cable or you can not use the product.
3,Good Compact Multi-Function Machine,The print quality is good. It copies and faxes quickly. The scanner moves a little slow.
3,sparrow: story of a songbird,"Exellent service from yourselves and the book is a MUST read. An open window on a culture long gone in the southern Italy; a sad story on a great love,forbitten by others with a forsefuland stroger will than the innocent,pure minded heroine, Maria. I didnt really need to know much before buying the book, as I had already been informed. Many Thanks,Mirella Britton"
4,"very good, although not great","Sandra Luna's voice is very fine, although not a truly great voice. On this album her record company have assembled a first rate team of musicians and found in Daniel Pucci, whom I'd never heard of before, a superb arranger. Consequently a few of the tracks are quite special: the versions of ""Milonga Triste"" and ""Duelo Criollo"" are outstanding."
5,Best book on Lunch boxes.,This is a must have for the Lunch box collector.It has all the Metal Lunch boxes pictured and a checklist/price guide too! I never go to a flea market with out it .
2,Fine if all you want is pictures.,"The amateurish publishing quality is distracting. The pictures are handy, as both sides of the box & thermos are usually shown. But if you want ANY sense of history, facts, or color...anything besides arbitrary price schemes...you should look elsewhere. ..."
5,Mindblowing Collection! Best Guide Of It's Kind!,"Even if you don't collect old, vintage lunchboxes (I don't), once you pick up this book, well, you can't put it down. I never realized just how many lunchboxes were produced over the years. Just looking at the boxes reminds me of when I was a kid in the late 50s and my mother would never buy the optional matching Thermos. No, she was afraid I would eventually drop it and break the glass liner. Still, I did have a few metal lunchboxes throughout my early school years. Although I don't recall the litho, I can never forget the smell of peanut butter and jam sandwiches wrapped in wax paper when I opened up my box. I swear the smell permeated the metal giving it a permanent odor! And the sound at lunchtime of all the lunchboxes in the cafeteria being unlatched and flipped opened and later snapped shut. If only I had kept mine. If only!"
2,Not very professionally done,"With the movie's title you would expect this film to be a Christian testimonial, and it is... but it doesn't come across very well. I watched this with a friend who is also a Christian, and we were both disappointed. In fact we didn't watch the movie all the way through. The story line was spotty and jumpy and the testimonies were not really clear what the different people experienced: exactly where they were, how they got out and when. Facts first... feelings later... please. I wanted to like it and even be able to use it as means of starting a conversation about the gospel but I'm afraid it won't function in that way."
1,DO not buy from Shop Wars,"I bought this product at Shop Wars through Amazon.com. This product cost me $94. When I received it in July, the expiration date on the box was Aug 2009. I called up Shop Wars and complained that I'm not going to spend close to $100 then have the cream go bad on me within one month. It's unethical. They said they will take it back provided that I ship it back to them on my own dime and they will charge me 15% for restocking. I asked them if they have other jars that have expiration dates a year or two out. They told me this is the last jar they had. I also gotten other Cellex C items via Amazon. But they are sold by Amazon and not their affiliates. Those ones have expiration dates about 2 years out. So the moral of the story is not to buy cosmetic products that are sold by Shop Wars via Amazon."
3,Looks like a home movie,"An uninspiring video, looking like it was taken from the window of a parked vehicle. Very little production value added. There are much better free video clips on the net which show far more detail about Bailey Yard and the shops, and give more information in the process. A mostly boring 75 minutes."
2,Basic but disappointing,"I bought this book as a basic reference tool for learning MS Publisher 2002. It's well organized and simple to follow. And if you like using a classroom text without the benefit of the classroom, instructor OR any of the instructor files, this is the book for you. Otherwise, you should choose another. It frequently makes reference to instructor guides and tools that are not included. Instructions to ""ask instructor..."" pepper the text. It has more pages and has sold more on [Amazon.com] than other Publisher guides. Now I understand why. The text is full of projects and tests that are not needed unless you are in a classroom setting. I'm sure it's the students who are buying this book for class. Sample pages viewable on [Amazon.com] are not enough to judge content."
4,Renaissance Illustrator,"I first discovered the artwork of Gennady Spirin with a children's rendition of 'The Tempest'. The 'Sea King' is just as beautiful. Spirin seems to have been inspired by renaissance masters like Botticelli. His illustrations seem very mature, but I've read these books to my nieces and nephews and they peered over the pages with wonderment.His old world style translates the tale vividly. I applaud his never underestimating a child's own ability to appreciate art."
2,Cheap Quality Reprint,Save your money. This book is a cheap reprint on comic book quality paper. The colors are faded and muddy. I have his Firebird book and there is no comparison.
4,Beautifully illustrated tale,"This book is a joy to look at, and the pictures will surely capture you child's imaginations. Set in long-ago Russia and the seas beneath, the story follows the brief love affair between a young minstrel and a mermaid. In the end, the young man choses to return to the land above the waves, but the bitter-sweet memory lingers. My 4-year-old mermaid daughter enjoyed it, but the book is probably more suited to slightly older kids and early readers."
4,"Review of ""The Sea King's Daughter""",This is a beautifully illustrated children's fairy tale. The illustrations are wonderful and the retold story is beautiful. I think both children and adults alike will enjoy this book. I highly recommend this delightful book.
3,it's NOT that bad!,"Although lightweight and a little heavy on 80s-era guitar processing, this record is a treat for fans of John and Phil. There a few tight, very catchy pop tunes that could have wound up on an Asia album if they had a little more six-string soloing along the lines of something Steve Howe would do."
2,Phil - Lite,"Being both a King Crimson and Roxy Music fan and owning a number of Phil Manzanera CDs already, I was looking forward to this collaboration between Phil Manzanera & John Wetton. After listening to this CD for a week, now I know why I never bought any ASIA CDs. There's too much good music out there to waste time with PROG POP ~ I'm glad I purchased this CD used rather than new but I still spent more than it's worth. Keep your money ~ this CD is only for diehard ASIA fans."
2,Allec Baldwin and season 6,"Percy's Chocolate Crunch, Salty's Secret, Thomas' Snowy Surprise, New Friends for Thomas, Thomas and the Jet Engine and now James and the Red Balloon. Song ""The Red Balloon"" is featured on video ""Hooray for Thomas"". Song here is ""Down by the Docks"". Episodes:James and the Red BalloonTwin TroubleEdward the Really Useful EngineThe World's Strongest EngineRusty Saves the Day (Best of the lot)Dunkin' Duncan"
5,Be Forewarned this album is incredible!,"Be Forewarned is the third near perfect album recorded by the lineup of Libling, Griffin, Hasselvander. This album ranks alongside the best of Black Sabbath and is head and shoulders above most other metal from the same era. Be Forewarned is menacing, loud, heavy, diverse and sinister. Griffin contributed some of his best songs to this album and his guitar sound is amazing throughout. Liebling still has a great voice at this point and contributes some killer tunes. Hasselvander also contributes some killer tunes and adds to the already powerful songwriting duo of Liebling and Griffin. Sadly, this would be the last near perfect Pentagram recording as Griffin and Liebling succumbed to personal demons and addiction. Best Tracks: Vampyre Love,LifeBlood, The World Will Love Again, Petrified."
5,One of my FAVORITES,"This is a FEEL GOOD book for the entire family!!! We first borrowed it from the library and had to buy it for ourselves. I even read it as ""mystery reader"" in my daughter's class!"
3,Horn adorned,"3 1/2While there isn't enough truly unique work on this particular volume to single it out in the epic set of numbered Masada recordings, 6 certainly sounds like a more vibrant overview than some of the others."
1,Nice ..... if you like a paperweight,"I bought this computer 6 months ago, and it has been nothing but trouble. The motherboard has went down 3 times now, and it has been in service more than it has been used.HP customer service is now horrible. Following others leads they have now outsourced to India, and they refuse to work with you.The computer has wonderful specs, but will not stay runnning for over two months at a time. Each time it has been sent in for service, it comes back with files missing, or additional hardware problems.I own a small company, and purchase computers 1-2 times per month. HP has permanently lost my business due to lack of customer care, and fualty workmanship.I would avoid this particular model at all costs. If you need further proof, type in HP Pavilion a815n Desktop PC and look at the number of refurbished units being sold through a huge national chain, this speaks volumes. Enough said."
5,FUNNY AND ENJOYABLE,"Saw Erik play in Maui twice, he is hilarious, if you get the chance you have to see him live!!!"
1,OH SO HARD,I bought this product to use on my husband and the sleeve was way to hard on his penis. It looks cool in the picture but it hurts more than it brings pleasure. we took the bullet out and threw the rest away.
4,Better than boars hair!,"An inexpensive, big improvement over boars hair shaving brushes: fuller and holds more water. The included stand just barely does the job but effectively stores the brush. I agree with what has been commented about the initial gamey order: my cat has found a new best friend!"
4,fabulously original,"I have read many of Lowell's books, this was the first of her sci fi, though. The character's are so complex and well drawn, a great story. My only warning is that this is the first novel in an unfinished series. But it is GREAT! I absolutely loved it. The relationship between the main characters is just wonderful."
5,I BOUGHT THIS C D AND IT HAS VERY BEAUTIFUL MUSIC,I HAVE BOUGHT MANY CASSETES WITH YOUR MUSIC AND I HAVE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOUR SONGS AND I THINK THOSE MEN ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL. I TRULY LIKE ALL THE LOOKS OF EACH MAN IN THE GROUP BUT THE ONE THAT IS EXCEPTIONAL IS THE ONE THAT COMES OUT IN THE VIDEO OF COMO TE RECUERDO EL DE LOS LABIOS TAN HERMOSOS QUE BESA A LA MUCHACHA Y LA BUSCA PERO NO LA ENCUENTRA. I TRULY DO LIKE YOUR MUSIC.
5,For Josephiles!,"Well there is the expected ""Fire"" and ""Dreamin"", but who thought there would be a better version of ""Satisfaction"" than the original? Listen to Jose do it (he's having a ball), and if you are still not convinced of his genius ... well you need an ear tune up. Add to it the wonderful guitar versions of the two Beatle tunes, ""Aint it Peculiar"", and the Dylan tune, well you've got a mixed bag of writers that provide Jose a framework upon which to hang his genius. I don't know about you ... I can't get enough of this guy."
2,What is This?,"This cd is a total waste of money. The version of ""High Heeled Sneakers"" sounds more like Ray Coniff does Iron Butterfly. Look I do not where these cuts came from, but Jose has got thirty different versions of every song he's done. Why, I have no clue. BUT, buyer beware. On this especially."
2,Old fashioned,"This books seems to be directed at beginning swimmers. It's too basic for more experienced swimmers. Addtionally, many of the drills seem a bit dated. I may be a little biased since I am an advocate of the the Total Immersion style of swimming."
2,Too Basic for the Common Coach,"Though fundamentally strong, this book is extremely simplistic. Anyone who considers themselves a somewhat experienced coach should bypass this title and begin looking elsewhere for a decent drill guide/idea book."
3,Basic swimming book,"If you have just started swimming, then this book suits you well. I find the approach a bit too basic for a regular swimming. Otherwise, this book may be too basic and too limiting with the drawn pictures of the the strokes."
3,Bath Picture Frame,"The frame is beautiful. The only thing I was not satisifed with is that the covering is plastic instead of glass and that was not in the product description. However, the seller did offer to make it right by allowing me to return it. I liked the frame enough to decide to have a glass cut to fit and the seller refunded shipping due to the fact that I was not completely satisfied."
5,Good product,I received that cable last month and now using it to access internet from 1st floor to 3rd Floor of the building. No problem at all. good product.
3,Disorganized,"This book had good basic techniques and tells you what tools you will need to get started scrapbooking, but it was poorly organized. Sometimes a page being discussed has a facing page which is pictured elsewhere in the book - I would have liked to see them together. When it gets into more advanced techniques, the instructions get less detailed, and are not always next to the page they are talking about, making it confusing. It's basically an idea book, but the ideas are pretty basic."
2,Looks great - but is really too wimpy,"After reading reviews on the less expensive Hamilton Beach drink mixer, I decided to step up to the more powerful version. Very disappointing. Cup is way too small to make a decent milkshake and it doesn't crush frozen fruit cubes for smoothies. It's definitely going back."
4,A good product!,"I bought this product back in July 2005 and have been using it to make my morning protein shakes. It does a good job of it. I cannot comment on its ability to make icecream as I try to stay away from that stuff. The unit has a very solid construction. The stainless steel glass is great. I just drink my shake from it. So it saves me from having to wash another glass. I just have one small issue with it. You cannot remove the spindle to clean it. You have to use the stainless steel glass with warm, soapy water, put it under the spindle and then rotate it around to clean it. Well, the problem is this - while I am drinking my shake, the spindle is dripping liquid on the part of the unit that flares out on the bottom. Okay, okay, it's no big deal, I suppose. All in all, I like this product, and I would recommend it."
4,Wonderful machine EXCEPT one tiny issue..... warning!,"The Eclectrics mixer is a nice, all-metal machine. BUT - if you took the deal offered on Amazon as of 1/09 and ordered the extra stainless malt cup for it (currently from overstocked kitchen) - you are in for a surprise.99% of the mixers out there use a cheap, readily available, standard 7"" tall cup - but not this little puppy! ...and when the recommended second cup I ordered arrived - you bet - it didn't fit! Arrrrrghhhh!!!!It gets better - try and find a 6"" tall cup for it - after trolling amazon and running ebay and some others, turns out the only folks who have one are hamilton beach them$elve$.If you want a second cup and this still doesn't deter you, call them directly to order it, the phone number's at hamiltonbeach.com"
5,My wife can now keep her blood sugar under control.,"On December 3, 2007, my wife was diagnosed with having Stage 4 lung cancer that had spread into her lypmh nodes as well as into her brain. The tumors in her lungs are pushing on her windpipe and swallowing is very difficult for her. I bought this for her to make her milkshakes, mix up some soups, and most of all to mix up some of the terrible tasting medicines that she is on now with ice cream so she can get it down.Without this product, it would have been much tougher to get her fed. We use this mixer at least 4 times a day. We love it and it is the perfect kithchen appliance for us."
4,Nice looking unit for the price,The drink mixer looks good for the price. I have only made one milkshake and it did not get the amount of froth I wanted. I have to keep working on the right combo of ingredients. I would recommend it to a friend but not for use in a busy kitchen or business.
5,Way better than a blender,"I had been using an expensive Kitchen Aid blender to make chocolate malts, since a friend got me hooked on them this summer. I got tired of cleaning up all the parts after each use; a huge hassle. I ordered this and not only is it a beautiful and sturdy appliance, it makes the shakes creamy and thick that you just can't get from a blender. It is easy to use, little to no clean up, and makes a true thick and creamy shake. The cup that comes with it is heavy stainless steel. Love it!"
1,Bad shaft,There are only two mixers on the shaft. As a result it is very difficult to mix the ice cream into a thick milk shake.
4,pretty good little mixer,"All in all, this unit works well. The first time I tried it for making malts, I had trouble. Get the ice cream to milk ratio right and it works very well.My only complaint is that the mixing blade does not come out for cleaning. Then you could put it in the dishwasher. Maybe I need a bigger hammer.Also, beware when going out to buy extra mixing cups, the 30 oz ones that are available everywhere do not fit in the holder like the 28 oz cup that comes with it."
5,Panasonic cordless talking telephone,I am pleased with this product although I cannot find a feature to give a number for speed dialing instead of searching for nimbers.
1,Buy another brand,"Talking caller ID gets annoying. Cant turn off ringer with handset. No light up keypad. Too small, hard to dial with one hand. Voice enhancement need to be turn to be able to hear person on othe end. Cheezy ring tones. Illogical menu setup. Too many buttons, Hard to awnser at night."
4,Great Product,"Got this phone to replace my existing Uniden cordless (which was alright with the Wireless frequency mixup but without speaker phone on handset it was not so good). I am totally impressed with this phone and better yet two handsets and expandable to 5. Very sleek, speak phone on handsets. The only problem though is it lets you maintain different phone books on each handsets (It could be a feature for some) and the phonebook size is only 50 per handset. Other than that, it is great as it does not interfere with your wireless router frequency and very compact and better clarity in voice."
4,Great phone for the money!,"This is a good phone for the cost. We love the feature that allows us to check messages from the handsets. And the fact that it comes with the 2nd handset makes it a great deal! My only complaint is the Caller ID voice. Our last phone, which was an AT&T (handset broke after it was dropped and they no longer make them), allowed us to record our voice for the caller ID on any calls from numbers recorded in our phonebook. This is automated based on spelling, and of course it isn't very good at proper pronunciation! We love everything else about the phone though!"
4,Good Phone - OK Answering Machine,"The quality of the telephone is just fine. The answering machine is a little disappointing.First, if you listen to a message and do not delete it, there is no visual indication that there are saved messages still on the unit.Second, the base unit does not have an audible signal to let you know there are messages on the answering machine - just a tiny flashing light.If you do not have or intend to subscribe to 'call waiting' service from your carrier, do not purchase this unit."
1,A poor purchase,"We had problems with these phones soon after we received them. They cut off after dialing a number. We called the company and they said to return them which we did. We have always been pleased with Panasonic, this may have just been one bad set."
4,Works really well,"Replaced some old Motorola cordless phones with this set. Is a step up in usefulness since this has an answering machine integrated in the main unit. Saves space on the desk. My one trepidation was losing the comfortable, ergonomic shape of the Motorola handsets. The Panasonic handsets, while smaller, are comparably easy to hold and have rounded backs. Most functions have to be adjusted by the on-screen menu. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out and set. The audio quality is very good.It's a good low priced phone although the talking Caller ID might drive you crazy. I find it funny but it can be turned off."
1,Keep a Proof of Purchase - you may need it soon!,After a service call from AT&T; at my expense it was determined that my phone didnt work - it had lasted just 4 months - I went to the Panasonic website for service info and found the model number is not listed. There is no TG6052B only TG6052M...and they are not open on weekends.One has to send all the phone items and wires etc to a service center in Texas (cost $ 15?) BUT YOU NEED PROOF OF PURCHASE - as I bought it online from AMAZON I dont have a receipt - I dont know how this is going to Pan out if you will forgive the pun. If you are lucky the best you can hope for is a refurbished phone sent back to you. If they dont have the right model they reserve the right to send you anything.Fortunately I kept my old phone - which still works.
3,Panasonic KX-TG6052B,"I have gone through so many cordless phones; all with various problems. This phone is clear, and has many options available. The ONLY problem with this phone, in my view, is that the ""talking Caller ID"" cannot be turned off; and it cannot pronounce much of anything. In other words, the Caller ID sounds like someone speaking another language and is more problematic than helpful."
4,Nice phone,"Nice phone, easy to program with a neat intercom feature and easy to read screen. The only problem I have is that it doesn't have a memo feature to leave family messages on the machine. I wish the extra hand sets were a little cheaper & I'd buy a few more."
1,Do not even think about it!,"I recently bought a Panasonic KX-TG6052 cordless phone. After only 2 months of service, it went dead: no dial tone. After spending about an hour on the phone with Technical Representative? I sent the unit (with a $12.00 postage fee)to the Panasonic Service Center in Texas. I got the phone back 2 weeks later. I recharged it and tried to make a call: no dial tone again! Now I have the option to send it back to Texas (with another postage fee of $12.00) or bury in in my garden. I am sorely tempted to choose the latter. A bit of advice: stay away from this unit in particular and Panasonic in general!!"
1,Missing important feature,"Received this phone/answering system to replace an older Panasonic system. Immediately found that the answering system does not have an LCD message counter! How useless is an answerer without the ability to be able to see how many messages you received and worse, after you play the messages there is no indication of how many are still left on the machine. Also, the annoying talking caller ID ""feature"" won't shut off even though there is a menu option to turn it off. Lastly, you can't set the volume up high enough to properly hear your messages without a completely silent room. Sending back to Amazon immediately! Note: Panasonic has removed the LCD message counter from all their new phones, so it's goodbye Panasonic."
2,Very Dissatisfied,"This is more of a toy than a real phone. I miss my old Phone-mate system.Drawbacks:1) Horrible sound. When using the handset the station speaker crackles.2) No battery back up.3) Horrible method of setting up the time (can't it just pull the time from the same place the DVD player does?)4) Short battery life of the handsets5) Phone numbers are stored in the handsets and not on the main station. Very aggravating.6) Phone is unusable during a power outage except for slamming against forehead for being so dumb as to buy this thing.Pros:1) The phone does ring.2) Caller id works.3) Nice color.4) Hmmmm. That's about it. Oh wait, I know. I have now learned never to buy a Panasonic product again."
1,Worst phone ever,"I purchased one of these and it worked properly for a few weeks. When the phone rings, a loud static-noise comes out of the base's speaker. When talking on the phone, voices on both ends are staticy. Occasionally, you can hear phone conversations over the base unit speaker. I exchanged it for the exact same model; after a few months it was the same thing all over again. This is a piece of sh$%!"
3,Panasonic cordless phone,Not as good as I thought they would be. Can't answer the speaker phone on the base. Not good quality voice on both ends.
3,Ok. Not great.,This product has a little fuzz when talking even in the same room at the base station. Not the crystal clear sound advertised. It works well enough other then that.
3,Satisfactory phone,"Panasonic KX-TG6052B 5.8 GHz FHSS Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System with 2 Handsets.The phone and the answering machine are satisfactory, but I would not recommend the system for someone interested in a TOP quality answering system and cordless phones. Voice clarity is very average and the ""voice enhancer"" only decreases the quality. The phone does NOT indicate (light or otherwise) that another phone on same line in the house is in use. The only way you know there is a voice mail on the server is when you pick up the phone to make anther call, or look carefully at the small screen -- neither is very helpful. The description of the phone led me to believe that for this good price I was getting a top of the line system -- and I learned again that you get what you pay for, so don't go by the manufacturer's description of the quality. All in all, a satisfactory phone, but not a top quality or a great buy."
4,Pleased with this phone,"Easy set-up, extensions work well, good sound quality. The only reservation from the friend who received this gift is that the speaker phone could be louder, ditto with the digitized voice on the caller id. The friend has a hearing loss, but says that his former Panasonic was louder. Overall, he is happy with it."
5,Excelente,"Muy Buenos estos teléfonos, en mi casa ya estamos acostumbrados a este nivel de calidad de parte de la gente de Panasonic. Altamente recomendables."
1,wall nount phone,this was bought to wall mount--even though it is listed as suitable for wall mounting it is certainly not an option
4,Good phones for the Price Panasonic KX-TG6052B,The phones work well and have many options. I bought these for my parents that are in their 70s and somewhat hard of hearing. The phones could be loader for the hearing impaired. But then again they may be only like this when I'm asking for money over the phone..Panasonic KX-TG6052B 5.8 GHz Cordless Telephone w/Digital Answering machine and 2 Handsets
4,Good Phone,"Easy setup. perfect size. Voice caller ID moderately ok....needs a little work....however, still shows initiative."
4,"Nice features, lousy reception","I've had the phone for about a month. I like the voice caller ID (phone announces who is calling) and the ringtone caller ID. All the features are easy to use. However, the reception has lots of static sometimes, which is distracting and makes it hard to hear the caller."
4,Mostly Satisfied,"Phone and most features work great, but the playback/listening volume on the base unit is too low. Unless the calling party speaks firmly, listening to messages can be challenging. Also the speaker phone only funtions when the handset is removed from the base unit which I find an inconvenience."
3,Panasonic KX-TG6052B. 5.8 GHZ cordless phone,Panasonic KX-TG6052B 5.8 GHz FHSS Expandable Digital Cordless Phone System with 2 Handsetsand answering machine is A is a good priced phone with easy instilation as well as easy programing to suit your needs.
4,el mejor que he podido comprar,El telefono tiene todo lo que nesecito. En cuanto al Voice ID no es tan claro.
4,Panasonic 5.8 GHz,"I've had good luck with Panasonic phones. So far, this appears to be everything I expected from Panasonic, quality item, well-built, works very well for my small business. This is a phone I would recommend for home or small office use without hesitation."
4,What I have been looking for...,"The only thing I would change is that the caller id would say the number when the it says ""not provided"" or ""Iowa call"" or whatever state one would be in."
4,This phone/answering machine is a good value.,"After researching many brands of combination phone and answering machines, I chose this Panasonic model. It was easy to install and works great for the functions that I use. I needed a basic cordless phone and a replacement answering machine and this one fills the bill. The phone reception is clear and the answering machine has the time stamp feature which is very nice. I have had this product for about a month now and am very pleased with it. I would recommend it and would buy another without hesitation."
4,nice phone for the price,"This is really a well functioning phone, nice and clear both ways, and I was able to give my son the other phone for his room upstairs; my only issue is that we mounted it where the other kitchen phone was on the wall, which was flat against the wall and caller ID was easily visible. This phone wall mounts at about a 45 degree angle, just drops into the cradle (careful not to knock it out), and is hard for my shorter wife to see the caller ID screen. However, it does announce the caller with a voice, pretty amazing technology...overall a good deal."
3,Second handset doesn't ring,"The phone works great except that after about month, the second handset wouldn't, doesn't, ring anymore. Nor does the keypad sound as each number is pressed. That makes it hard to find if it's not consistently and religiously kept in one place. Something we didn't think about until we got it...it doesn't indicate how may messages we have, just whether or not there is a NEW message."
2,phone,I have been having trouble with static on the phone and not being able to hear very well when talking on it.
3,The Real Truth or Not,"Okay-which is it? Was Joe Sr. like this book says or not? There are too many contradictions out there that portray him as NOT the nicest guy and his politics on the communism/anti-semetic side. I'm just looking for the real truth and I feel this author goes way!!!! overboard trying to excuse everything Joe Sr. and Rose kennedy ever did that was questionable. Like how everyone makes her out to be the quintessential mother-well that's easy to do when you're always traveling without the kids, shipping them all over the world to boarding school and have no less than 3-5 nannies etc.This author whitewashes the major negatives about Joe and Rose Kennedy to a fault."
1,MEMORY HOG,"I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO LOVES DORA BUT WHAT A MISTAKE! SHE HAS OUR OLD COMPUTER WHICH IS NOT A POWERHOUSE, BUT THIS GAME IS A TOTAL MEMORY HOG AND I HAD TO DELETE EVERY OTHER GAME IN THE COMPUTER TO INSTALL IT AND IT STILL WILL NOT WORK WELL, SO, UNLESS YOUR CHILD HAS A TOP OF THE LINE COMPUTER,,,NOT RECOMMENDED!"
1,NOT For kids under 5! TOO HARD!,"My son is 3 and a half. He has mastered many games like Jumpstart Preschool, etc.. This game is way to difficult for him. There are numbers moving on the wall, so he not only has to identify the numbers but try to click on them as they move past. I would HIGHLY not recommend this game for younger kids under the age of 5."
2,Not much to it.,"If you have a child that loves Dora and you have [amount] to spend, go for it. Otherwise, steer clear. Here are my reasons:*There is not much replay value in the game. It is the same set of tasks to perform each time you play and they always come in the same order.*There is not a large variety of things to do (Discovery Airport was the same price and it seems to have a lot more to do).*The tasks that are performed do not seem have much educational value when compared to other software like the Jumpstart line.*The product seems like it was put together quickly so it could be rushed to market in order to capitalize on Dora's popularity.Having said all of this, I will admit that the graphics are nice. It does look like the show."
2,My 2 yr old played through this game in 20 minutes.,"There is very little interaction so it's more like a cartoon with four short activities thrown in. The activities don't have a repeat option so when they're done, you're forced to move on.The graphics are nice but we could get almost the same amount of interaction with the TV show. A big disappointment."
4,Great game for toddlers!,"If you child likes to play on the computer, and likes Dora, this is a great game for them!My son just turned 3 and loves to play this game. After playing each individual game with him, he was able to play on his own. The different levels are a great feature. Most of the games deal with number recognition, so the lower the level, the less numbers it deals with.There are also some print-outs to color, but not many to choose from."
2,Gameplay is OK - but Dora's voice is annoying beyond belief,"My 4-year-old has this game - and she likes it OK, even though this is not her favorite game by far. Actually, there is one main reason I gave this game just two stars - the voice and speakig manner of Dora, the main character is so annoyingly whiny and affected, it embodies everything I hate about the way certain people (typically female) are speaking. This unnatural, annoying voice grates on the nerves so much that I'm seriously considering removing the game from the computer so that my daughter won't speak the same way."
3,Trouble for the Mac user,"We bought this game because my son enjoys Dora and the game specifically said it would work on the Mac. Well the game is great and works great on our PC, but we cannot get it to work properly on our Mac. There is a patch on the website which we have tried, but the game works ""hit and miss"". The problem is that the mouse does not align properly with what is on the screen. So, I would recommend the software but not for MacIntosh users."
1,MAC Users Beware,"I bought this product because it specifically stated that is is supported Mac OS X 10.1.x and above. Turns out that there is a problem with the mouse tracking on OS X 10.2 that makes the game unusable. I went to the company's website for a patch only to find out there isn't one, and there will not be one. Their solution is to install it in 0S 9 and boot into OS 9 to play it. I checked for OS X support specifically to avoid such nonsense.I am very disappointment in this product as a result and would recommend looking elsewhere for both Windows and Mac if a company such as this cannot properly fix their bugs. $15 wasted and one very unhappy Toddler."
2,Just Ok,My daughter is 4 and loves Dora. The game is short and not interesting her. Also it's seems there are a few glitches in the game. Trying to get the stars into backpack is nerve racking. You don't actually click on the stars but just to the outside of it. It becomes a pain. Don't waste you money.
2,Boring!,"I have a 3 year old, and after a week, she is already bored with this game. For $20, there should be more to do. It constantly repeats itself, and has no real direction. Very limited number of activities available, and really no variety. I would not recommend this game at all. I am currently reading reviews to find something much more interesting."
2,It's OK,"This game is OK and my 3-year-old son plays it from time to time. He loves Dora and Diego, so I thought this would be a great hit, but it has been pretty disappointing. There are two game ""tracks"" with 3 levels of difficulty. My son completed both tracks in about 30 minutes. It's pretty repetitive after that, even at higher skill levels. He gets pretty bored with the long-winded videos in between the actual games.I took off an extra star for requiring that the CD be in the computer when he plays the software. It's 2011 now -- get with the program. You require me to register the program any way, so use a license number like every other software company."
4,"good size, very reflective.",I bought these stickers for my new trailer. They are highly visible and do not require any installation. No permanent damage to the integrity of the trailer walls.
3,need to read,Haven't read it yet. It appears to be the book I was wanting to read. Glad it was available on Amazon.
5,So Appropriate,"We are now in the Year of Faith, and it is perfect to study the Documents of Vatican II and this book comes with notes and comments to assist in understanding."
3,"This book is quite old, and as a result the pages are yellowed and brittle.","I was happy to receive the book, even though it is old and yellowing. I was hoping it had less paper deteriorization. My original copy is even worse shape and pages are following out. The external appearance was excellent, and will still look good on the shelf. Sure wish there was a way to get these old classics in a new binding."
3,A Little Dated and Somewhat Uneven,"The 12 articles in this collection are a little dated for readers interested in film theory. E.g. its ""novel cognitive perspective"" is hardly novel today. There are some insightful articles, particularly the first four under ""Kinds of Film, Kinds of Emotion"", but many of the remaining articles drift without channeling a clear direction. There is enough of substance in the book to warrant buying it, but there are better and more up-to-date books available now."
4,Great for the money and a safe bet,I put these into my work truck a 2002 Ford Ranger. Accompanied them with a ported balfle and a cheap JVC deck power. They sounded nice and clear with good bass reponse and crisp highs. Latter I added an Amp 75 x4 to each of them and they realy came alive.They can't take that much power so Im only running the amp and half power. The only down fall is that the highs are a bit sharper then the infintys in the past but that can be mitigated by so many things its not a real issue. All and All a good safe choice for anyone who just wants good sound. Great for the money and not bad for a work truck.
3,"it's really cute, but a basic flaw","I love the idea of a pig cookie cutter. This one is very cute! The dilemma is the tail! I roll my dough out to 1/4"" thick, and the tail stays in the cutter every time. I've tried things to stop it, but... it's just part of the design. Oh well.I like the size of the cutter, and I can always ice the curley-que in. Just be aware you'll be poking the dough out with a toothpick!"
3,A little pricey,"I just saw the same cookie cutter for $1 in a store. Darn. So, a little pricey, but cute. Will still have fun with it."
3,Polished but lacks direction at times,"3 1/2Masada five starts off crisp enough and usually exercises equal parts restraint and excess, which for this ambitious crew of Jewish jazz musicians is always a good thing. Somewhere down the line though a bit of melody becomes lost beneath all the fiery bluster of horned crossfires, taking this release down from great to quite good when entire compositions during chiefly the latter portion fail to ignite into convincing wholes."
2,Stupid thing does not have auto off,"I like the design on the whole, but not only does this unit not have auto off, it also has a rocker style switch that is easy to bump on accidentally. That means I have to plug and unplug the unit each time I want to use it. Really dumb design. Even the low cost coffee pots that I have bought have had auto-off, and this unit was not exactly cheap."
5,A Holiday Tradition!,"This hysterical family comedy hour will bring tears to your eyes and a stitch to your side. So many times we yell, ""My mom does that!"" or ""My dad sounds just like that!"" A laugh-romp from start to finish, you'll see yourself and your family in every joke. Love it!"
5,"Hi-tech, flexible and cost-efficient!","This is probably the best storage/backup solution for standalone computers(if you're a sysad and need to backup whole divisional servers, better stick w/ industrial tape drives;)). Very fast, flexible and reliable, cost per MB is hard to beat, overall a better solution than Zip disks or CD/RW for storage and you can even use it as a secondary HD(it's fast enough to put a Windows swapfile on it!!!). Best of all, they just announced a 5.7GB version."
1,This as sucky as its gets for remixes,"Fellow u2 fans, this is terrible,as if Satan himself mixed it really bad on purpose.remember the ""Numb Soul Assassins mix""? this as bad just with New Years Day.-_- DONT BOTHER PLEASE! LISTEN AT YOUR OWN RISK!!"
1,This game installs malware,"Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some important aspects of the game:This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks the administrator from editing certain parts of the registry.3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remains permanently on your computer.6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.Currently two class action lawsuits have been filed against Electronic Arts (EA) for their use of SecuROM."
2,Not what I expected.,"I tried to save some money by getting this version instead of the guardian angel brand. I wish that I haven't. Everyone is right about the paint job. It is awful. The paint is bubbling off and has many sharp edges. My husband had to sand it down and repaint it because I was worried about my son's safety. I am also very disappointed that it isn't very high so you can't open your window all of the way because the kid can just climb over. You have to rig you window so that it can't open but maybe half way. It is alright, but if I had to do it over I would just spend the extra bucks and do it right."
1,Antique Clocks Identifiction & Price Guide,When got it found out was for Windows 95/98/NT/2000. Had troubel loading it and even seems only partially loaded. Efforts to e-mail the company was unsuccessful on two occasions. If had to do over probably won't have bought the product.
2,Why buy the book?,"Without spending a dime on the book, anyone can access ecollectica.com and have access to everything. You don't need a CD-ROM or anything else in this offer."
1,Antique Clocks Identification & Price Guide,What a disappointment. When I installed the CD and clicked on the links I got a notification that the link was out of date and no longer available Therefore the information is very limited
4,Very nice but doesn't swivel to offer strain relief,"I love this cable; I bought it after a scare in which $3 Monoprice optical cables broke and left the plastic ends inside of my expensive equipment. I was able to get the plastic bits out, but the experience gave me big pause on cheap cables. So I ordered several times of more expensive cables. This particular cable is thin, has a wonderful woven exterior, and nice connectors.However, the connectors do not swivel like the $40 Monster Ultra cables. I like the woven exterior on this cable more than the mesh the Monster cables have, but I suspect the Monster swivel will protect my gear more and reduce strain on connectors.At the end of the day though, this is very nice cable. If you have high end components that cost a lot of money, reconsider what happens when cable connectors break. I haven't tried breaking this, but I also trust the plastic more than I now trust the Monoprice cables."
5,"Finally, a great look at American adolescence.","This volume is the first on a new series on Adolescence and Education, edited by two renown professors, Frank Pajares of Emory University and Tim Urdan of Santa Clara University. This first book covers general issues and begins with a first-rate chapter from Barbara Finkelstein that provides an overview of the history of adolesncence from an American perspective. The Woolfolk, Midgley, and Kaufman chapters are superb. The book should be of interest to anyone interested in how modern scholars are conceptualizing adolescence in American society today."
3,Not Great,"I got this box because of its price but was not really satisfied. I won't be getting any more Zebras because I found their flow inconsistent and their barrels not very durable. The fact is if you're looking for cheap pens for a public setting then they're up to the job, but if it's something you're planning on using on a daily basis you can do better. I now take care of my pens much more than I did in the past as a way of getting around the cumulative expense of having to purchase them continuously."
1,new pens that won't work,"I bought a large package of these pens in early 2010. I stored the ones we weren't using in our desk supplies. When I needed a new one this weekend, I pulled one out and couldn't get it to write. So, thinking that I should have stored them upright, I put the pens in a mug on my desk. Two days later, none will write. They all look as if there is plenty of ink as another reviewer stated. What a complete waste of money. I will be throwing away 7 of these."
3,No blobs of ink,"I happened to end up with one of these pens, and I liked it so much that I had to order a box.I'm tired of reaching for a pen at home, only to get one that won't write right away or leaves blobs of ink. These pens begin writing instantly and smoothly.The other reviewer is correct about the point size--it's more like a fine point than a medium. But that just keeps the writing crisp, with no blobs.After using these for some time, I have to downgrade my original rating from 5 stars to 3. They are still a good deal for the money, but a lot of the pens will stop writing with a lot of ink left. No ink blobs, but the trade-off is that they might not work at all after awhile."
2,Stop Working and Fall Apart,"I bought these cheap black ink ballpoint pens for a hospital setting where I write a lot of notes throughout the day. (I use cheap pens because they get misplaced or others pick them up. I have lost too many expensive pens over the years.)While I like the grip and they write better than many other inexpensive retractable pens, the Z-Grip Medium clear barrel retractable pens often stop writing at the most inopportune moments. I have to carry 2 or more pens with me because one will inexplicably stop writing even though there is plenty of ink and no visible air gap. No amount of scribbling will allow the pen to write again. The pens also fall apart and sometimes the retractable clicker will stop working. I am down to my last Z-Grip pen out of 24 and I will be moving on to try some different brands."
3,Retractable & cheap,"I just bought a 7-pack of these at Walmart for $2.50! I agree with other reviewers about them being 'skippy' & not consistent in delivering ink-on-paper while writing in some situations. I was a big fan of Zebra Orbitz retractable gel-ink pens when they were still available at Walmart because of their price, and Zebra F/G-301 stainless because of the refill ability(But I kept losing those). Genrally I like the consistency/ease of writing, waterproof & archival qualities of gel-ink pens from Zebra. This pen is OK especially at the price I paid, but not my favorite, but it's not gel-ink.Maybe I should just go back to using a pencil."
1,These things suck!,"Every single pen I've used stops working long before the ink has run out. There appears to be plenty of ink left, but all of a sudden the pen stops writing regardless of what I do. What more is there to say. Don't buy these."
1,THIS PEN SUCKS!!!!,"At first I thought this pen was great. But very shortly (by most ballpoint pen standards) after you start using it, it just decides not to work any more. This is the 5th or 6th time this hashappened with this brand of pen. I just threw out the rest of them.They are terrible...avoid them at any price."
2,Bought them for their cheap price and nice color/look,"They feel and look nice but they aren't worth getting to be honest. Normally I'm a junkie for anything Zebra brand, pink or purple, but they don't write very well! The ink is VERY faint, and the pen isn't as smooth as it should be. I do love Zebra's Ola Pens a LOT better, if you want anything Zebra pen related don't get these! Try Ola instead."
3,Serviceable. Perfect for my needs,"These are standard issue, ballpoint retractable click pens. Nothing much to say. Not top of the line by any means, but completely what I needed for my job bartending and waiting tables, where they tend to get dropped, grabbed by guests, lost, and broken quite a bit. I need something that is will work and is cheap. Not much else matters for my needs, so I'm happy.That said, this is not something I would buy for my personal writing needs at home or at the cafe in my off-hours. I'm much more a fan of the higher-end brands that are more costly, but will last a lifetime if you treat 'em right. These are disposable, and therefore in an entirely different category altogether."
3,Comparison with Papermate Profile,"I have both the Zebra Z-grip and the Papermate Profile pens. They look almost identical, but they are very different quality. Currently on Amazon the Zebra costs about half as much, but the Papermate writes much smoother and with a deeper ink line. Both are worth the price, but you get what you pay for."
4,I love the Z-grip pens,"I love these pens. They have a comfortable grip and are the only reasonably priced retractable pens with a metal pocket clip. Since I usually carry then in my jeans pocket, I have found that plastic clips break frequently. I am surprised at so many negative reviews, I have no problems with them."
4,Good teen film,"I liked Beastly a lot more than I thought. It started slow, with a few eye-rolling moments... but by the middle of the movie I was hooked. I think Vanessa Hudgens is an underrated actress, which probably puts me in the minority. I hope she can shed her HSM past and take more adult roles. This is also the best performance I've seen from Alex Pettyfer. His ""ugly"" self must have inspired him."
3,Good......,"I saw this movie at The Cinema with my daughter and I thought it could have been better. It is a nice story and not dull or boring. The boy that gets the spell cast on him looks more like some guy who got tatooed all over than a beast.....But..I always liked the myth that someone can like or fall in love with someone ..not by what they look like..but because of who they are...Wouldn't it be nice if it was really true? If not born beautiful, or handsome..one is shunned..made fun of and for what? because they do not fit the Ideal of what is acceptable and they cannot help how they look..if they have thin hair or bad teeth or too tall....I think all people should look more closely and see that beauty is more inside than out..."
1,Bad Movie,"There is very many words to describe this movie, all of them are synonyms for the word bad.I feel bad for the actors, because this probably pushed them down in there career. You have to wonder if the actors even tried though in some scenes... I know the writing was what made this movie bad, but the acting was throwing salt on the wound, and then squirting lemon juice on it too. All in all this might be one of the worst movies of the century."
4,Review of Beastly,My daughter recommended this movie to me and I liked it. The story of Beauty and the Beast told in a modern setting with a few interesting twists. Definitely a keeper and a movie I'll watch again.
4,Beastly,This is a really fun movie about how a boy and girl fall in love. However it is not your typical romantic movie and how they fall in love is quite unusual.
3,Okay updated version of old story,"Kyle is a spoiled, handsome rich kid who dumps on those less monied or less beautiful...until a teen witch casts a year-long spell on him to make him quite unattractive. The only way to break the spell is to get someone to declare honestly, ""I love you."" Otherwise, the curse will never be broken.Not a terribly imaginative story, but the actors are more or less appealing, with a decent soundtrack. Good date movie for the younger set."
1,THE WORST BEEPIN MOVIE IN THE BEEPIN WORLD!!!!!!!,THIS BEEPIN MOVIE WAS THE MOST BEEPIN MOVIE IN THE BEEPIN WORLD!THIS WAS TOTALLY NOT WHAT I WAS BEEPIN EXPECTING!TO DARK!AND IT WAS FULL PLOT HOLES!REMINDED ME TO MUCH OF BEAUTY AND THE BEAST BUT TO STINKING MODERN!
5,alex is back!,"great pic of alex pettyfer in 'popstar' mag. other than that, nothing much has been mentioned about the summer release.alex was in 'tom brown's school days' and 'alex rider: operation stormbreaker'. they were hoping for a full series of movies based on the books, but 'rider' bombed at the box office.alex did a great job in both movies, esp. 'rider'. it is good to see him back and working. i hope he gets the recognition he deserves, even if it is only becuz of people wanting too see vanessa hudgens at the movies.the added bonus of neil patrick harris, might bring in the adults as well, making it a family movie nite.the story is 'beauty and beast' told from the beast's point of view, which hasn't been done before. alex spent 4 and half hours in make-up (and 1 and half getting it off) every day. but i hope we get to see a lot of him as he is as well. he has certainly worked hard in everything he has done. (martial arts and stunts in 'rider'.) he deserves a break."
4,beastly,"a new twist to beauty and the beast. received in a timely manner, I've already watched this one several times. thanks for getting it out to me so quickly"
4,Beastly,"It's a plain and simple very i know what comes next though still fun film to watch. A rich popular guy has a curse put on him by a very cool witch and the ugyliness from within him is now showing on the outside. He has to find someone who can love him for who he is. The film seemed real fast pace in the first twenty minutes, from this to this like that! After it slows down and it's just him trying to get the girl while dealing with a blind tutor and his house maid who's trying to get her children into the country. It was an ok film and funny enough, the main guy actually looked cooler and way more interesting after he was cursed, like don't get ride of the curse, you look much better.. haha..."
1,Horrible,"I watched this expecting a frothy little film that played on the ""Beauty and the Beast"" theme. Instead, I saw this. The two leads have about as much chemistry as a dish of soap and a fork. It wasn't there. Vanessa Hudgens's idea of acting is to make ""cute"" faces and stand around staring, trying to look thoughtful or meaningful. There's no explanation of why there's a witch in the school. She's just there and casting spells. Huh? The blind teacher is another loose thread. There he is...but he does nothing except make ""profound"" statements every so often. Of course he has to have a happy ending at the end.This could have been so much better, but the dialogue was cheesy, the acting was bad, and so many things seemed to be thrown in to see what would work. Save your money and rent/buy the Disney version."
1,The Horror! The Horror!,"I saw this movie last night when I was on a plane and I couldn't wait for the plane to land so I can write a review. The only possible positive regarding this movie is that it proves that everything and anything is possible in this life, including the making and releasing of this dire movie. Watching this movie also brought to my attention that airplanes nowadays don't carry vomit bags. The plot was nauseating and quite possibly created by an elementary school drop-out with a Beauty and the Beast fixation. Maybe the movie would have been saved if it had decent acting, humor, drama, effects, witty dialogue or anything that would remotely be considered art or entertainment. Unfortunately, this movie had nothing to offer other than childish dialogue and a premise that would make any movie starring Rob Schneider a classic."
1,Horrible!,"Nothing to do with the book! They took away all the fun stuff (the chat group), all the process the character went through! And an Olsen girl for witch? And a tattoed boy for beast? Come on..."
3,Beastly from ED Movies,"I love the movie. It was ok to get from ED Movies. I should have know that since I got a used one it was going to have a lot of problems. There were scratches on the dvd and some of the parts were frezzing for only a second and one part of the movie keep repeating til I had to fast forward that part to get to the next part of the epsiode. But all and all it turned out well, played well, see well like new. And thank you of shipping it early when it was going to come in between July 18th-August2nd.Thanks."
4,loved it!,"I really enjoyed this movie,its such a different and modern take on beauty and the beast.I liked Alex Pettyfer in ""i am number four"" and he did a great job in this movie too."
2,Cinematic Trendiness Gone Awry,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict -- ""Beastly is a terrifying example of cinematic trendiness gone awry. For some inexplicable reason, it has suddenly become fashionable to offer new twists on familiar fairy tales. There's nothing inherently wrong with that idea, but Beastly is a film which delivers a concept at the expense of...well, everything else. This is one of the most maddeningly incomprehensible films I've witnessed lately; a movie which plays as if a 13-year-old girl and a sentient copy of US Weekly joined forces to write a screenplay via text message based on a trending twitter topic. Admittedly, I'm not the target audience for this film. However, those who dig this sort of thing really deserve better than the sort of half-baked garbage Beastly delivers. This is one ugly, irredeemable little movie, and no amount of magic is ever going to change that."" Full review at dvdverdict.com."
1,A beast of a movie (and not in a good way),"Look, everyone I know told me that I was foolish for wanting to see this movie despite the fact that (even I) thought it was going to be bad. I still subjected myself to it and was gravely disappointed. In short, the script was bad. The acting possibly even worse. The entire execution left me pondering how an entire group of people could set out to do something that would take months and months and oodles of dollars and feel good about the product while they were making it.I was interested in a modern day, real life take on the beauty and the beast story. I really thought it could have been done well.This, wasnt. I spent $4 to see this. I wish I would have saved it and applied it to the next movie disney releases out of the vault. :("
3,Doesn't compare....,"This movie, Beastly, while containing many scenes that I felt were stiff and a little dull was an okay movie. However, being someone who read and loved the book version which was excellent, I was a little disappointed at how the movie turned out. I feel like it was rushed and didn't capture all the important aspects that were in the book. This movie is only 86 minutes and the book is quite long, so that alone shows that the details were not exact or relevent to accurately portray the entire purpose and lesson of the story. I give it 3 stars for visual aspects, and the few accomplishments it made to stay true to the story."
1,"""beastly""",It got ten minutes out of me. I couldn't go on.Zero stars. But they wouldn't let me post that.
5,"sweet, simple and a movie with a heart","this is a movie made for its target demographic. a simple yet sweet modern take about beauty and the beast adapted from a book that inspired that old tale.it is fun to watch and i can highly recommend it to the whole family to enjoy. just don't be like a picky critic and you will definitely have fun watching it.many film critics hated it ( as if this film was made to win awards )but fortunately there are a few who did liked it who knew from the start that this was made for the viewers to enjoy and not to be impress by its technicalities/acting,etc."
4,beastly,the library has not received this yet but I enjoyed in on TV.I wish they would come from Amazon to the library faster ahead of the market place so we (the library) would have them first.I also would like to say the guy turned ugly seems to look like more of the tats the kids are getting so not sure he would be viewed as ugly by all. :)
3,The Book was Better,"In my opinion, everything in this movie progressed too fast or was solved too easily. For example, one minuted Lindy hates ""Hunter"" and the next, she's infatuated with him. It happens too suddenly to be realistic, even for a fairy tale. The book goes into much more detail, and while I realize the movie writers couldn't include every for the sake of time, they seemed to have left out key elements. It's always nice to see love triumph over adversity, but if there's no challenge, who cares? I strongly suggest reading the book before, or instead of, seeing the movie.Beastly Movie Tie-in Edition"
4,Feel good movie!,I wanted to see this movie at the theater but the idiots at my local theater think that action and kiddy movies are the only things worth showing. This may not have been an oscar worthy film but if a movie can make you think or feel than it's done its job. I have to say though; A.K. Olsen steals the show!
4,"Cute Movie, Cute Beast","So I saw this movie because a friend and I were laughing at how cute the ""ugly"" guy was. I mean even as a monster he was sexy as-all-get-out. We laughed because we both agreed it wouldnt be hard for either of us to fall for him regardless of that mess on his face. He still had gorgeous eyes and a bang'N body. If you really wanted to make the movie good, they should have given him a huntchback and a beer gut and made him stank like cornchips and garlic. NOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOVIE WORTH SEEING. The movie was cute and worth checking out when it hits the Movie Channel or Starz or something. I guess I should read the book, because I dont understand why the Olsen girl had so much power. What gave her the right the play ""GOD""?"
1,BORING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!!! Worst Movie !!!,Where shall I start! No character development. No storyline. Pathetic script and absolutely no chemistry between leads. A waste of time in every way. No surprise it got 1 star from Critics. I should have trusted the experts. Save your money for something worthy. Its not really even a chick flick. It is just bad in EVERY way!
4,Very Modern Twist to Beauty & the Beast,Nice & Modern based on the Beauty & the Beast story. Great for kids and teens. I enjoyed watching it with them too.
2,Made for the younger crowd,"As a adult, this one came off as made and edited for the young folks...its almosta Disney movie. Entertaining up to a point...glad when it was over.Not a keeper."
5,Great modern twist on Beauty and the Beast,Such an excellent movie. I am going to watch it over and over again. It's a great watch with the hubby.
1,boo not worth renting badly done.,This was the worst star trek video I've ever seen and I've seen them all.He jumps around mostly talking about himself. Badly written and done.Stupid.
5,Really well done,"William Shatner stars as an interviewer. He deftly draws out revealing and personal snap-shots of each actor who's played the role of Captain on the Star Trek series. A commonality of character traits among them interestinly developed for me. No doubt, being a Star Trek fan is a prerequisite for enjoying this movie."
2,not really about Star Trek,This isn't really about Star Trek. It MIGHT have been interesting to listen to interviews with the actors portraying the captains but it wasn't. Shatner interrupts his subjects regularly. The Avery Brooks segment was odd. The Kate Mulgrew segment was misogynistic. It was awkward and uncomfortable when he put Patrick Stewart on the spot. I did enjoy hearing Stewart and Shatner discuss their feelings about being forever linked as Star Trek captains but it wasn't worth watching for that part.
2,Uncomfortable to watch,"I love Shatner, but I could only watch the first 20 minutes of this. His interviewing skills are terrible and he keeps interupting those he talks with questions that don't make any sense. I know he is the writer and producer of this, but it wasn't very well planned out. I hoped for something better from Shatner."
1,"Shatner's ego is too large to write, interview, direct, and produce","The parts where the interviewed captains were talking were pretty cool, but the parts where Shatner constantly interrupted them and talked about himself instead were not. I am a huge Star Trek fan of all the series, and I strongly disliked this documentary. Sorry other actors being interviewed - this rating is not about you."
4,Captains are people.,"I really enjoyed the candour and openess of the Actors responding to Bill Shatner. I especially liked the interaction between Bill and Kate Mulgrew. I thought that the DVD demonstrated that Star Trek went beyond the series and affected the lives of the actors, some to the good, some not so much. I recommend it for viewers who see actors as being people, not only characters. I would love to see a First Officers and a Doctors DVD as the format impressed me. Leonard Nimoy or Jonathon Frakes interviews perhaps?"
4,The Captain's Come To Terms...,"This was a nice little documentary on each actor's views on the characters they played in the various incarnations of Star Trek. The fact that it is done as Bill Shatner's journey to visit each one is rather unique, and at times pretty funny (Seeing Kate Mulgrew finding him sitting in a box on a street in New York for example)."
5,Incredibly well done!,"As a long time Star Trek fan, I have seen countless interviews of various cast members but nothing quite like this! It is incredibly well done. It offers insight into the actors who had the lead in every series or movie including Chris Pine. Shatner interviews all of them and I am surprised at how well done it is. If you love Star Trek, get this DVD!"
5,Endearing,"I just finished watching this, and I have to say that I actually teared up a bit in different places. The personal information that each of the actors shared was quite unexpected and rather endearing. There's a lot to love about this documentary.Stewart and Shatner have an obvious friendshipMulgrew and Shatner make a somewhat tense pairingBrooks and Shatner...eccentric to say the least, philosophical and uniqueBachula and Shatner, unexpectedly comfortable and familiar around each otherPine and Shatner...more interesting than I imaginedAmong former crew, there are appearances by Jonathan Frakes, Nana Visitor, Rene Auberjonois, Robert Picardo, Jeri Ryan, and Connor Trinneer. There's footage from a Star Trek convention, England, Los Angeles, New Jersey, and New York.Highly recommended for the Star Trek fan."
4,Must see for Star Trek fans or would be television actors,"I was surprised how honest these folks were about the art and business of acting. All of them were very successful and yet their success destroyed their personal lives. It's also fun to see how their humanity, (personal strengths and challenges) shaped the roles."
3,William Shatner DVD,"Somewhat interesting but William Shatner comes across as very conceited. I enjoyed the interviews with the other ""captains"" especially Patrick Stewart (Jean Luc Picard)."
3,The statistics of the NHL,"The NHL source for all the statistics you will need. These stats will be quickly outdated though, and you will need to buy a book every year."
5,I Love It!,This book was a quick read with a plot that holds you and references to the '60's that I truely identified with. I hope Ms. Thornton keeps 'em comming!!!!
5,Very Effective,"This was my first time using St. John's Wort. I wanted to get a reputable product so that my experience with it would accurately gauge it's efficacy. The first few days I felt significantly more mentally energized. I also felt more susceptible to anxiety, which I was able to suppress with some simple relaxation techniques. After about a week I became more comfortable with being ""up"" and the potential for anxiety decreased. After 2 weeks of use I feel much more positive about things and have a relaxed, energized feeling. Be aware that you will become slightly more sensitive to sunlight and should avoid certain foods like yogurt and bananas. Kwai-Kira definitely works for me and is well worth the money."
1,Anxiety,"PLEASE be careful with this if you are prone with anxiety. I took this and within an hour I felt completely manic. I could feel the adrenaline surging through my veins and my heart was going crazy. My mouth felt like it was full of cotton- unlike anything I've experienced before. It is the morning after and I feel still very hyped up. I don't doubt this could be beneficial to some, but please use caution if you are anxiety prone or are already suffering from anxiety."
3,Jury is still out,"I have been taking this product for the last 3 weeks, that it would improve my memory some. so far, I dont seem to notice a difference but maybe I just need to take it longer. delivery and service were good but I think I need more time before I can say for sure that it is helping."
1,"Comet version compass is useless, thermometer ok.","Comet version compass sticks and points North at whatever direction you want depending on how how many times you tap it; so it's useless. Thermometer and general construction ok, but nothing special. Can purchase for $4 at Target a similar item by Coleman with the same poor compass quality. Save your money and buy something that works."
1,This compass is as bad as the free ones on keychains.,"UPDATE!!!I have now gone through my second compass. Both compasses stopped pointing north eventually, both would settle on 3 different directions not matter how still or level the compassed was placed. I even had a group of people try it so I didn't feel crazy and nobody could get it to work. Suunto replaced them without a problem but I tossed them in the trash when they left me hanging in the woods."
1,Inaccurate and NOT Reliable,"The Suunto Clipper Micro Compass is not accurate or reliable. It consistently failed to point in the proper direction which renders it completely useless. I repeatedly tested its accuracy against other compasses and it continually failed to point in the correct direction.When it comes to utilization of a compass reliability is a significant factor and this compass is not reliable. In addition, it is made of plastic and is easily breakable.I do not recommend this compass."
1,Waste of money - junk,"I bought this compass based on previous experience with Suunto products. The compass is a piece of junk. Barely turns to point north, and you have to wiggle it before it moves, even when holding it level. The slot for threading it through a watch band is open on one side, so it can easily slide off the watch band. The dial is very hard to turn. I only paid a few bucks but it wasn't worth even that much. Don't waste your time with this garbage. Wish I saved the packaging to return it just out of principle."
5,Excellent!!!,"Smallville soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks i listened to last year...in fact here is the list of outstanding tracks in the album. Save Me by Remy Zero- since its the theme for the series (Everytime I hear this song it somehow reminds me of the opening credits of Smallville). Even though im not a huge fan...Weezer- Island In The Sun (Oh well, this band never fails to amuse me...of course who will ever forget ""Buddy Holly"" and ""Sweater"".) . The Flaming Lips- Fight Test (If youve never heard of them remember ""She Don't Use Jelly""?). Sixpence None The Richer- Don't Dream It's Over (A Crowded House Original). Even if This Single already appeared on ""Divine Discontent"" Album its still worthy to listen to. An excellent album. Add it up to your cd shelves now... Buy it with any Sixpence Album. You wont regret it."
4,Not what i expected,"It has some music from smallville on it like say 2-5 percent of what they really use. And the songs like greg jones - Ordinary not on here. If they are gonna use music in scenes people like, they should at least make a score or something with it on. I was kind of dissappointed that there were video's which i never watch and a map? on here? If the map actually unlocked downloadable content that would be good but it didn't. Where is the Original soundtrack to smallville? That is my question. I'm sure alot of the public would like to have it."
2,Smallville (Original Television Soundtrack),Was disappointed in this soundtrack. The selection of songs were not to my liking.
2,Smallville-Talon Mix,"The tunes are A+, and if you only listen to it in your car. The format of the CD is not compatable with all computers if you use your computer as your inhouse media center."
5,"""Super"" Album!!","You don't have to be a fan of the show to be a fan of this music. This soundtrack is a great compilation of relatively ""known"" and ""unknown"" artists. It's a great way to discover some new music that isn't bombarded at you by those Top 40 radio stations. Of course some predictable songs are on the album like Remy Zero's ""Save Me"" and Five for Fighting's ""Superman"", both of which are great songs. However, there are several refreshingly new developments. Eva Cassidy's haunting cover of ""Time After Time"" gives you a whole new respect for the song. Sixpence None the Richer also does a wonderful job with Crowded House's ""Don't Dream It's Over"". This is a very mellow, chill-type album for those rainy days when you just want to play some great music and relax. My only complaint is that there aren't enough songs on it! I really recommend it!"
5,Wow! Best Soundtrack purchased..ever!,"I recieved this for christmas this year, and have already burned a hole through it listening to it so much! Such a variety of great artists such as weezer, and remy zero. A great soundtrack even if you aren't a huge fan of the show. Highly recommend for diverse amount of GOOD music. None of the songs are there are poorly done, no need to skip over 5 to get to one good one,and no songs were just thrown in there to fill space. Great for on the road or just ""chilling"" and hanging out. Highly recommend to anyone that wants to buy a great cd instead of decent."
5,"Smallville, Vol. 1: The Talon Mix",This album has some of the great songs from the show Smallville. They are mostly from seasons 1 and 2.
4,great,"Great cd, thanks to this show I have a new favorite song ""Save me"" and another song I will carry on with me for the rest of my days ""Everything"" by lifehouse. Oh the rest of the cd is all good too. Go get it already."
3,Smallville,"I can't believed they left out two songs:One: Sparkle by Ruby Horse ; the one with the line ""how you sparkle, how you shine , how you rise above the sky""Two: I don't know the name, I think its called "" Real World"" its a bit jazzy, when Clark is asking Chloe to the dance in his barn.Also, leaving out ""The Calling"" was a pity."
4,Give us the best of the rest,"the smallville album is fantastic!! theres only one problem, not enough songs on it!! there are loads of great songs from artists such as Kid Rock, and The Calling,played in the series so why are they not on the album, but on a plus side, this can only mean they will have to bring out another cd!!! and i cant wait to buy this"
3,Good songs but got during the fad,Liked the songs but later realized i got cd more because of the hottie on the show then for the music.
4,Smallville Volume 1,"Out of the two soundtracks, this one is the best. The mixture of songs has the feel of the show. There are about 5 or 6 songs that are the best. I was a little disapointed by the lack of extras in the inset, but if you have the boxsets, then this id not a major thing.good listening :-)"
3,"Myopic, But Unparalleled","Fletcher's is the only recent comprehensive history of the Southern Baptist Convention. The past twenty years have produced little but various interpretations of modern Southern Baptist controversies. Unfortunately, Fletcher has succumbed to the same temptation. From the distribution of the text, it appears that Fletcher has raced through the convention's early history just to get to the denominational controversies. It would be easy to criticize Fletcher for his myopia if one could locate any Southern Baptist historian prepared to do otherwise. As the situation now stands, this is the best (indeed, the only) Southern Baptist History available new anywhere."
2,Mine broke,"I have been renovating my house, and put this saw to a great deal of use. The angle selector handle feels beefy, but if you turn the saw over, the handle connects to a thin piece of cast metal.This is appearently not strong enough. Mine broke the other day, after about 12 months of periodic use.Overall the saw was accurate, comfortable and fast to use. Initially the unit appears to be fairly well put together. Once it broke, I took a moment to examine the undercarraige where the failure occured. Yep. Black and Decker alright.Having owned a few other B & D products over the years I didn't expect too much. I was hoping this product would surpass those expectations. It didn't."
4,UNBELIEVABLE !,I NEVER SAW A BETTER MITER SAW FOR THE MONEY.THIS IS SURELY THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK..[A LIFETIME CARPENTER]
1,not for mac users,"I was so excited to get a great deal from Amazon on what I'd heard was a quality burner. As soon as I'd taken my new burner out of the box, however, I immediately started to have problems. First my mac wouldn't recogize the device in OS9 (the platform for the burner software)... ) I finally got my mac to find the burner after I rebooted it in 9 only, but thenthe software wouldn't allow me to drag more than one track into the recording que at a time...Although this may be a great drive, I really have no way of knowing because I haven't been able to burn cds yet. If you're a mac user, pick a different product."
2,Not a big hit,Present for my 6 yr old grand daughter who loves cats but she was not impressed with this.. The quality is very poor..
5,Love these cats!,"My daughter is really into the Warrior book series, and these cats are now named after many of those characters and made up ones of her own. She loves them and she's 11 years old!"
1,Warning a lot of this is text analyzing scripture,The majopr weakness of this volume is that a significant chunk of the last portion of it is dense text wit ha few illustrations on each page of Cerebus analysizing and interpreting the early books of the Torah. I actually don't mind religous comics in fact find them interesting but this isn't comics it's dense not very well written text- if you are interested in Cerebus and comics this books lacks a lot of the quality comics found in earlier volumes. If yo uare interested in Judeo Christian religous interpretations and analysis- my guess is yo uwould be better off with a realo text discussion of the issue than this non-graphic novel.
5,our book club adores it,"My book club often does readings at juvenile halls and we picked this book last week from borders.com. I must say, to know that the author is 23 years old and that the pieces in this book are relevant to what is going on with our youth (black, latino and white) today is pleasing. The young fella were excited when they read the Soledad essays and especially the poem ""still standing"". I think that the author has a good head on his shoulders and his references and depiction of the man/woman relationship amongst our youth is truthful.If anything, i suggest that people dismiss these reviews and find out for themselves if this book is useful.for us, it was..."
1,black vs. white?,"Too many people flock to junk like this where the actions of blacks are dismissed, then they march or have a protest and we give in. I think that this book is one-sided and too much emphasis is placed on black-this, black-that. If poetry is supoosed to be world-wide, who said that black people have the right to use it as some spiritual or something.I give this NO STARS because, as a white american, I am offended that this book is by black people and for black people and it doesnt have any place in America.Thank you."
3,One Piece Voyage 3 season 4,I am a big fan of this series. In this voyage they got there berries for there gold and went to find a shipwright. A bunch of tragies happened and everything is starting to fall apart for the strawhat crew. I hope things turn out right again in the next voyage.
3,Eureka!,"I knew only a phrase of a poem I had been using for years: ""Perhaps my Faith, like my race, is an accident of birth"". This book had the poem in its entirety. The name of the poem is Charity. To me, it was worth the $20 I paid to get to the ""chapter and verse"" I'd been wanting for so many years! Other than that I have not yet browsed around in the book."
1,Imation respects its clients.,I bought 2 spindles. Had a problem with one of the spindles. It peeled off after awhile. I sent an e-mail to Imation and they promptly sent me a new spindle. It is always good to deal with a company that respects its clients. I will surely keep buying Imation's products! Correction: 5 stars.
1,don't buy these,"Imation CD-Rs are terrible. The sound quality is nothing to complain about, but the physically, these disks fall apart. I bought a spindle of 50 and now less than half of them work. The top layer of the CD-R, the actual part that music or data is writfen on simply peels off of the plastic base. If you take your finger and brush up on the edge of the cd, like you were trying to peel a sticker, it will come right off, I promise. No other brand of CD-Rs that i've used do this. Try Memorex instead, I havn't had any problems with this brand and they are in the same price range."
3,Why did the price go up?,The price on this item was about $30+ a day ago. Now $50+. There are only 3 left of the graphite rod models and they went up over twenty dollars in price each??Why the price hike?
5,This is an amazing game,"If you want a game that is inclusive and fun for all ages then you've found the best game. We played this game at a recent family reunion. After dinner we sat around and chose a card and then everyone who wanted to, chimed in with their thoughts. We all came away feeling like we knew each other better and my children especially enjoyed the game because they felt closer to their relatives and they learned some things about themselves,too. I plan to buy a bunch of these to give to family and friends.Enjoy!"
5,Excellent for family therapy.,I use this game for times when children and families are struggling to communicate. it is a great way to engage them without being too direct.
3,No pretense here!,"For me, Bill Wyman was always hands-down the coolest Stone. Granted he sat out half their recording sessions, and was virtually immobile onstage---but it was the WAY he was immobile! In any case, the then forty year old Wymans 1976 release is refreshingly free of pretense. This artist knows he is not an artiste, and is happy to have fun with some excellent sidemen recording a few earthy wine and wimmen' ditties. For Wyman fans mostly."
4,Thanks Bill,"A beautiful artifact perfectly molded from its era like an old hockey mask. This man is a seasoned pro then and now, and can he ever find a groove!! ""Apache Woman"" will conger images of Brando's girl at the Oscars while ""Feet"" and ""Every 60 Seconds"" will stop James Montgomery in mid sentence. This album will always have a place in history. Wyman cooks and flavors blues like a master."
2,"Improving, but not much","On his second solo effort, Bill moves away from the Beggar's Banquet-ish country rock and into an R&B style that he would later revive with The Rhythm Kings. He does some great covers of Quarter to Three and If You Wanna Be Happy. Everything else pretty much remains the same as Monkey Grip - Bill's tuneless vocals, a stellar supporting cast, and double entendre lyrics. Exercise caution when buying this, chances are you won't like it unless you make an effort to look past the flaws."
5,Awesome Product,"I bought this product to use for my cruise. I applied it the other night before bed, using the gloves as recommended (several pairs came with the product)and woke up in the morning with a beautiful even, natural looking tan. I loved that the lotion is tinted so that you can see where you have applied and make sure you have it all rubbed in. It looks just like the spray tans that you get at tanning salons, only better because you can cover your feet and hands more accurately. The only drawback is that it develops a very strong odor after a couple of hours just like the booth tans do, so I highly recommend that you do it at night so that you can wash it off the next morning! Love it!"
2,I did not like this product.,It might be because of my very pale skin but I did not like this product. It stained my hands even though I washed them a couple of times during and after applying the lotion (but my hands are very pale). It streaked and kinda came off in the shower when I used it but it came off unevenly. I threw it away after using it a couple of times.
5,Great product,"This product was recommended in Consumer Reports, and I was not at all disappointed. I have a light olive skin tone and my husband is white white and the product looked good on both. Natural looking."
5,Love it,This is the self-tanner that I keep coming back to. I've tried many and this always works great.
3,Eh...,"Pros-Pleasant smell for a fake tanner-Ended up with a noticeable decent tan, not too orange, perhaps a little streaky.Cons-Goes on initially way too dark to go out in public. That initial darkness fades as soon as you shower into a more natural look, but you need to apply the tan when no one will see you for several hours-Though it says overnight, I Would not recommend unless you don't mind stained sheets.-It's difficult to apply evenly, the lotion is somewhat thick, and tends to dry quickly so it doesn't smooth on in an even coat.-You have to scrub your hands like a maniac immediately after application if you don't want black hands.I bought this fake tanner because they discontinued my last brand, and this one had good reviews. Over all I was not impressed. I did end up with a fake tan, and I will continue to use up this bottle, but I don't think I would buy this brand again."
4,dreamdoll,"This self tan smells great and glides on nice, very nice natural tan. Product came in box factory sealed. Will buy again!"
2,Itch,This product made me itch so I only used it once. I was hoping this wouldn't happen because nearly all the sunless tanners make me itch!
3,"Rocky, but Cocky!","This cd rocks and has great singing by its frontwoman. However, I feel that alot of the songs are too slow and just drag on and on. My favorite song is of course, ""Collide"", but not many of the other songs on this cd sound alot like it. I think they have done a better job with this one over ""Naked"", but it could be improved some more I feel. Hopefully thier next release will be even rockier and better written. I like the singing more that the music. They just need to write some better material on thier next release."
2,Don't bother,"This is such interesting subject matter, but this book just doesn't cut it. I read it quite awhile ago and don't remember anything other than it was written on a level for ""pre-schoolers"", as stated by another reviewer. I wouldn't recommend it unless you're looking for a very light, mildly entertaining read."
2,There are much better books out there on body language,"I read this book and felt unsatisfied. My questions about body language were largely left unanswered. There is a lot of analysis of subtle facial expressions were line drawings -- Maybe I just don't get it.I read a much more helpful book on body language that I would recommend. It's called ""The Definitive Book of Body Language"" by Barbara Pease and Allan Pease. Skip the Quilliam book and read the Pease book instead."
3,Stainless Steel Holder,"It looked great when I first got it. After a month or so, it started to rust. Not a big deal because I can spray paint it, but I did expect it to hold up better."
2,"This is not the work of Rumi, it's only the author's interpretations and historical recollection","I expected to get a transcript of the actual works from Rumi to read and interpret myself. That is not the case with this book. While it does provide the historical context (that's why I gave him 2 stars instead of 1), the author feeds his views and opinions in front of the actual text by Rumi. My opinion of the author's style is poor, at best."
2,Basic MP3 Player,"This is basic MP3 player. I use this for listen to music till I fall a sleep at night. For that purpose, this is good.You may able to buy a better MP3 player for similar price. Like Sancdisk Sansa - very good player with radio inbuilt.I kind of like the earphones came with this."
3,Boring,"This book was not very helpful in improving my Spanish writing skills. They have lots of examples, but the writing is of higher quality than the student level is ready for. Therefore, I couldn't even understand some of the examples due to the difficult vocabulary. I think writing needs practice, and no book can teach you how to get better unless you try it yourself. I had to buy this book for a class and ended up not using it, so I dont reccomend buying this book even if you have to."
5,Go back to school before complaining about this book.,"As for the book itself, I like it. I need not elaborate further. As for the previous critics of this book, they seriously need to improve their grammar, spelling, and punctuation before performing complex tasks, like writing a book review. These mistakes do not exactly endear credibility, or convey intelligence."
2,If you need battle tips...,"If your going to play the American version and want to find all the secrets then this books IS NOT for you. If your lost in a deep dungeon, the maps might help, however don't take them to heart, you'll get lost. I have to admit that the battle tips are good, they will teach you techniques that will give you the edge on the battle. As for boss Stats, I have to say they are wrong, while sometimes they say ''You should have no problem with this boss"" it turns out to be very hard, and when they say ""One of the hardest bosses you've faced so far'' turns out to be easy.. In conclusion, use this book as a reference not a guide, so if your not good at RPG's don't use this book. One more word of advice, don't read the text next to the pictures of the Heroes unless you want a spoiler.... I think the book tells you a little to much about what is to come.."
1,:(,This certainly WAS unathurized -as the company would NEVER allow something the bad to be official!! The translation of the game was terrible and it didn't even cover everthing! This is just about as accurate as the Dic dub of Sailor Moon was to the original! O_o;all I have to say is that it's a good thing I got it free with my preorder!
1,BAD,They didn't get names right. They didn't know thier right from thier left. They used the wrong strategys when it came to beating bosses.
1,This book sucked!,"This book sucked! A blank note book would have been as much of a help as this guide was. All I can say is if I were blind and this were my guide I would be walking though an intersection in the middle of rush hour. I implore you not to waste your money on this book. If you want a real guide buy the one produced by the company. It may be a little more expensive ,but it is a million times better."
1,"Yeah, like THIS author ever played the game...","Well, maybe she did, but not too many readers of this guide would disagree with that statement if they have tried to use it. Inaccurate lists (as they refer to equipment found in the Japanese version of the game), incomplete (and confusing) maps, plot spoilers, and tons of white filler space are what this ""guide"" is riddled with. Most everything all the other reader reviews have said about this book is true. I couldn't suggest you buy the official guide (which is EXCELLENT) or even the July 1999 issue of Expert Gamer magazine, both of which give you something that qualify as a strategy. An obviously rushed job, expect no boss or fighting tactics to be found, nor any of the game's secrets. It's not the worst game guide in existence (believe me, I've read hundreds)--that honor still goes to Prima's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night guide (check my review for that as well for a good laugh). Still, avoid at all costs."
2,Prima's unoffical Lunar guide is a bad buy!!!,"The main problem with this guide is that is based on the Japanese version of the game. Working Designs spent alot of time changing the game for an American audience, so the guide is basically worthless for the American version of Lunar:SSSC. Not to mention the poorly described dungeon maps and the poor black and white photos. The guide looks like it was done by a kid on his home computer rather than done by a professional publisher."
3,An Average Stategie guide,"It could've been better, they do have great boss strategies and walkthroughs. There are some problems not all there info is accurate, like names of items and such, I think mainly because they got mixed up w/ the game that cam out in Japan too. They don't tell you what level you should be for certain bosses, but not most strategie guides do, I used this throughout the game and didn't find too much trouble w/ it. I havn't seen any others guides for this most excellent RPG."
1,No Strategies and Incomplete Item and Weapon Lists,"Prima is usualy a good source of information when it comes to game guides but in this case it was very poor. The guide is difficult to read with black and white maps and the guides heavy use of symbolisim which is very anoying. It is missing chests on maps, numbers and item names are wrong and it does not tell you where to find everything like most Prima guides do. Not only is it incomplete it is also wrong. I do not recomend this book if you have already beaten the game but for first timers who just need to get out of a tight spot and to advance in the game."
1,Don't buy this book!,"I was lucky enough to get this strategy guide for free when i bought the game. the maps are very confusing, the symbols are annoying and it is not in color!!!"
3,descent guide,I found that this book helped me go from place to place but it did nothing as far as strategies and the boss stats were all wrong.
1,The absolute worst strategy guide ever made!!,"For starters the so called ""guide""(I'ts so worthless I do not think it deserves the name strategy guide)is based on the Japanese version of the game(What the heck?That's real smart[I said that sarcastically];how could someone be stupid enough to release a guide based on the Japanese version of the game in the U.S.?)!!Second,it has close to NO maps!!Please whatever you do;do not get this guide.At least I don't think you should,but if you absolutely must get it,go ahead and waste your money.It's worthless."
2,Came broken,"The rings are cute and will look good on the cupcake and I know the kids will love to play with it after eating the cupcake, but I received the ones that I brought with broken and missing rings. I emailed the provider, but never got an answer."
4,Diego rings were perfect!,I purchased the rings for my sons second birthday and i was not disappointed. the quality is sturdy and the images are great. the kids loved seeing them in their cupcakes and couldn't wait to wash off the icing so they could wear them. very cute!
4,Diego Cupcake rings,The cupcake rings were super cute and arrived very quickly (quicker than the expected date). We purchases other products from this vendor and would recommend them.
2,Packing needs improvement,"Hopefully I was just one out of a million, but my clock came with the second hand out of place. Instead of my crazy self returning it, I let my brother repair it at home. I thought it was perfect, but it runs much slower than a clock should. Instead of going into it again, I just gave up. They just have to watch how they pack and ship their items."
4,Finally! A great Chicken Tikka Masala recipe!,"It took me so long to find a recipe book with a good Chicken Tikka Masala recipe in it!Not only is there a wonderful recipe for the Tikka Masala, but loads of other curries and staples like naan and polau rice. This book is definitely worth picking up if you like Indian food!"
3,BritSpice Gift,Gave this cookbook as a gift to a fellow Indian food enthusiast. I was told that the book looks like it has recipes for some great dishes. The only drawback to this purchase was that it was purchased just about two months before it was received by mail and therefore was a very belated part of her birthday present. I do have to say that the Greener Books seller was responsive to my emails and did eventually get the book to me.
1,Meh...,"A slow progressing play that is just, frankly, not as funny as the author may have intended. Not worth the time or money involved."
1,This drive is junk and Seagate warranty is a sham,"I bought this drive a little more than a year ago, because I thought my 4-year old Maxtor drive might be nearing the end of its life. My Maxtor drive still works fine, but this Seagate drive failed. Despite the ""5-year-warranty"" claims plastered all over their website, Seagate refuses to honor the warranty. Their Indian call center can't tell me what the actual warranty is, only that it expired 10 months after I bought the drive.This drive is going in the trash and I'm going to buy Maxtor from now on."
5,A Must-Read Relationship Guide for All Ages,"I only recently discovered Joan's lessons on love and relationships. Rich in example and insights, her book contains some of the most memorable statements about relationships I have read. Her message is clear and on the mark. I wish every 20 year-old would read this book - what angst we would save the world from!"
2,NEW AGE RELATIONSHIPS,"Read ""a course in miracles"" as a prerequisite to this book. ""A course in miracles"" is the dusty, 19th century folk-art/religious cult of Millard and Myrtle Fillmore,a typical pre-Freudian, highly artistic interperatation of Man and God. Joan's book is no less pre-Freudian, but certainly less dusty. New age writers have no proffesional credentials other than their lofty artistic impression of man's (and, ahem..., womans) divine nature. Don't look for complex answers with this book, ...unless you're intimidated by simple addition."
1,A loving relationship does not require work???,"I disagree. Even a perfect, loving relationship with your soul mate requires some degree of work and sacrifice. Any licensed marriage counselor will tell you that. Gattuso believes that once you find your soul mate, it should take no effort to keep the love alive. Everything should fall into place without any work or sacrifice, she believes. No effort? That may work in fairy tales but not in real life! I was much younger (and single) when I read this book. I totally bought into her views, but being older and more experienced (and happily married for seven years), I know better now."
2,TOO FAIRY TALE LIKE,YES BOOKS CAN BE ABOUT ANYTHING AND ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN IN THEM but this book was too 'perfect-fairy tale' like. I will say I've never read any of this authors other books and nothing about this book made me want to read any of her others. I didn't like it probably because I'm not a romance novel type of reader. I only read it because my bookclub chose it. If you like this author you may very well enjoy this book. I didnt and just wanted to voice my opinion on it.
5,A Great Story!!!!!,"This was absolutely a wonderful story! I must add that the models on the cover that actually matched the characters was definitely a plus! I enjoyed the story so much that I have read it twice (so far)!! I can't wait to read about the other Grayson's. I love the respect they have for their mother, who is meddlesome, but loving, and obviously wants to see her children happy. This was my first book by Ms. Ray and I quickly went out and purchased her previous books.I hope we hear more from Luke and Catherine's unfinished story. Will they adopt?!! You, Ms. Ray, have found yourself a #1 Fan!! I'm anxiously awaiting the BET movie, Incognito!!"
4,"Exciting, but not as thrilling as the preceding sagas","I have each and every book written by Mrs. Ray. I find her style of writing exciting and real. Until There Was You is a good book. I enjoyed it, but it did not keep me tied to every word like her other books. There were times when I had to re read to keep focused on the plot or timeline. I also had a hard time taking in the overall impact of Luke and Catherine's relationship. I did like the exchange between them and the inter play of their family and friends. I especially like the way Mrs. Ray portrays loving, supportive and happily committed men who ""take care of thier loved ones"". All of her books have unique qualities that make them special. I look forward to reading about Morgan and can""t wait for Sierra's story! I am looking forward to her next book! Keep up the good work Mrs. Ray."
5,EXCELLENT,I've read previous books by Ms. Ray but I completely and totally loved this series. It has enough drama and erotica to keep a brotha turning the pages. Well worth reading (again)!!
4,"Gripping tales of adventure, dastardly deeds and heroic acts",An exceptional first book by a new and exciting author. Hernon's latest offering The Savage Empire is out now. Read them both and learn alot.
1,Good Functions that rarely work,"I bought my system in Nov 2007 because I was looking for a system that can read files off USB and memory cards. It worked good may be for few days. Now only thing works is Radio. Other functions like CD, USB and SD card works rarely and have their own timings when to start working and when to quit. I opened the system so many times and played with this and that, plugged and unplugged internal connector cables, basically opened up the whole system from A-Z and closed it back for many times and still have the same problem. I will work on this piece of garbage for some more time whenever I will be free and try to figure out where the problem is. I like its functions but quality is zero out of ten. I got it for $40 but it doesn't even worth that money. I will be really cautious buying anything from COBY in the future"
5,"Searing, compelling, and cutting-edge snapshots","Very highly recommended for browsing, Code Red is an impressive collection of newspaper editorial cartoons written and drawn with a sharp sting by editorial cartoonist Ed Hall. From a motorist shown hooking up an IV from his arm to his gas tank in order successfully fill up his car; to an overeater claiming ""Hey, I can quit anytime I want"" with regard to french fries that have a health warning printed on them; these cartoons are searing, compelling, and cutting-edge snapshots of cutting-edge social, political, and cultural realities."
4,Truth is 1000 times stranger than fiction,"If I had not sat next to the author at a dinner party shortly after the book was published, I would not have believed this story, either. I do believe it is true and all the stranger for it. One of the most bizarre adventure stories ever written. Don't miss it!"
5,Keep the river on your right,"This is an excellent book. Rarely do I read a book where it would be difficult to imagine myself in the author's place. Mr. Shneebaum's outlook on the world around him and his approach to the events in this book were refreshing and new to me. This was as satisfying as finding a new food to love. I was amazed at this man's lack of fear. At present people seems to gauge another's fear by what extrodonary stunts and adrinaline rush's they persue. But this man is the most fearless man I have ever read about. The only thing I could say bad about this book is that it is short. If it were not for social stigmas- this book should be required reading. There is more to learn about the human animal, love, adventure, exisitinialism, and the insanity of some western social morays than can be found in any other book I know of this size."
3,Strange and meandering,"This was a different book than I expected. More internal musing than anthropological observation. It was an easy read, with one particularly violent and disturbing scene. Otherwise, the authors ramblings were less disturbing, but also less interesting. I bought the book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR, and he sounded like a fascinating person in a bit of a gruesome way. The book was okay, but nothing I would read again. I would, however, be interested in seeing his artwork before and after his soujourn."
4,Prepare for an armchair jungle excursion!,"Schneebaum takes you on a sensual adventure in the jungle in this richly detailed book. Since the author is an Anthropologist with an interest in homosexuality, parts of the book on male bonding and cannibalism are so honest and clearly described that some readers may feel uncomfortable. I found the author's frankness refreshing, and I recommend the accompanying DVD that shows what has happened to the ""cannibalistic"" tribe since Schneebaum was there in 1955."
2,Noble Savage genre. Should not be viewed as nonfiction,"This book is billed as the true adventures of the author in the rainforests of South America. A large part of the book deals with his stay among a tribe of headhunters. The book is well-written and entertaining, but I seriously doubt if most of it is true.I have been to the rainforests of South America and have read ethnographies of some of the indigenous tribes there.Schneebaum's descriptions do not ring true. In addition, Schneebaum would have us believe that the rainforests are idyllic paradises where we can wander for days without discomfort. Not true. South American rainforests are hot, wet, bug-infested and anything but comfortable. The average tourist wandering alone without appropriate gear and food would not last 48 hours.File this one with ""Mutant Message from Down Under"" and the Carlos Castenada books: Anthro-fiction."
2,Well-written fantasy,"The movie does nothing to ""prove"" that either cannibalism or homosexuality were common among the Amerikaeri. Not one of the tribespeople attests either of these phenomena. I am quite sure that the anthropologists who were filmed and challenged the factuality of what even Schneebaum himself does not claim is nonfiction were not included. The real ""proof"" (disproof) is that the man whom Schneebaum claims to have eaten part of was alive and met by an anthropologist (T. R. Moore) during the late 1960s, more than a decade after Schneebaum's visit. (No one doubts that he was there, but those who know something about other peoples of the area doubt what he wrote about a homosexual idyll and the cannibalism he writes about.)Schneebaum writes well, but reading all his books show him to be obsessed with primitivist fantasies, which he dates back to seeing a circus ""wild man of Borneo."""
1,Fake,I was interested to see if some Amazon reviewers had twigged on this mildly sappy series of inventions and musings.
1,Junk,"this is like a straight from china, poor quality, waste of space. It worked for about a month or so then the mic inputs just stopped working. the product feels cheap, looks cheap, and resembles an old school cheap DVD player.look elsewhere, not vocopro."
3,Third Album Is Stuck In the Middle...,"Between their 2 sonic-defying debut albums and their pop breakthrough album ""In Heat"". ""Strictly Personal"" finds the band rocking along, oblivious to a new phenomenon called MTV and unwilling to change a thing about their delivery. This is both good and bad as the band delivers reliable Romantics standards on songs like ""In The Nightime"", ""Spend a Little Love On Me"", ""She's Hot"", and ""Bop!"". Things get dragged down into repetition on tracks like ""Why'd You Leave Me"" and ""Can't Get Over You"". There are no great Romantics tracks here, but no real bad ones either. Pick your 4 or 5 favorites and add them to your iPod playlists, then forget about the rest."
2,"The only ""near"" DUD by the Romantics... for fans only!","If you were to buy everything by the Romantics you'd have a collection of some of the greatest rock 'n roll ever recorded! Unfortunately, there would be ONE stinker in the mix... and this is it!Producer Mike Stone got the crazy idea to produce these guys like your average, mainstream ""hard rock"" or ""metal"" group (BIG mistake). Add to that the fact that Mike Skill (original lead guitar) was replaced by Coz Canler on lead and you end up with the only Romantics CD that doesn't sound like the Romantics at all.These guys were always KINGS of power-pop/garage/rock 'n roll and they suffer here in the land of ""hard rock/metal"" production. Thank god they got rid of Mike Stone and went back to familiar territory on the next release (""In Heat"") which allowed them to finally have some real chart success.""strictly personal"" is for Romantics fans ONLY and even then... you might be let down!-JM"
3,Detailed Research,"Good reseach for those truly interested in this type of thing. I was not that interested in it, though, to get that deep."
2,Smoke but no smoking gun,"I am not a Mormon but a long time student of the religion and it's history. I found this book to be over-written and turgid. The author's include every fact but what the principals had for breakfast. They lose the narrative flow under a barrage of repetitive and unnecessary details. I felt they were trying to hide the fact that they did not have real facts by snowing the reader with minutiae. I am willing to accept that A Manuscript Found was the basis for The Book of Mormon. I know Mormon didn't write it. But, the author's coincidence heavy account of how the Smith-Rigdon-Cowdery plot worked left me unconvinced. Their explanation of the hoaxers behaviour in later life is especially weak. Save yourself some time and skip to the last chapter for the summary of their argument."
2,Yet Another Dee Jay Nelson,"Cowdrey loses all credibility by posing as Oliver Cowdery's descendant (when he assuredly was not...their names aren't even spelled the same) and by using such terms as ""king of the Mormon people"" to describe Joseph Smith."
2,"Playing is outstanding, the sound mixing sucks!","For those you of eagerly seeking recordings that validate the incredible Miles concerts of the late 80s, you might want to pass up on this one. The mixing is so bad. Adam's keyboards, which are often used to fill in the sound, are so prominent you can barely hear Kenny (sax) Daryl (bass) or Ricky (drums). I am telling you, the mixing really sucks. Obviously an amatuer production. Stick to Live Around the World until the rest gets released."
3,Nice shirt,"The color and quality on the shirt are both good. I only gave it 3 stars because the price is average. So while you are getting a good quality product, you are not getting a good deal."
2,unrealistic expectations...,"I guess I should have read the title more carefully. I went to school in Halifax (1990-94) and having seen among other things, anchors embedded in sidewalks, was curious as to the 'why'. The Halifax explosion was the answer I got.The book covers the means to the end (the explosion) in the first 30 pages or so, and the rest of the book is about recovery and how it was dealt with and stories of individual survivers. I really wanted to know the details of what led to the explosion and had my answer after the first 30 pages. I never bothered to finish the book, wasn't interested in the survivors stories.Jason"
2,You get what you pay for sometimes......,"Ugh! This blender is terrible! I was in a pickle and bought this because it was cheap! Well, beware you're better off paying the 10 bucks more for virtually any blender. The motor is really weak! No matter what speed you use it's all the same... Went to use good ol' barcadi frozen mixers and had to use a spoon to help mix it! The engine barely mixed the bottem half let alone actually mixing what ever you're making.. There's also an odd plastic smell when you use it. Also, didn't realize this thing had a plastic container! Never buy plastic! No matter how much you clean it, it will always have an oder of your previous mix. Plus, glass is more sanitary for liquids. Just stay away from this blender and spend the few extra bucks for one that'll do the job right."
3,Not so Hot!,"I loved Bella Andre's first two books. I thought the sex was exciting and the love stories sweet. In ""Red Hot Reunion"" I could tell that the author really wanted to make a point of how in love the couple were in college and how much their love was fated to be. But frankly, the sex was all very basic stuff and not near as spicey and erotic as Bella's ""Tempt Me, Taste Me, Touch Me."" That book I loved.If you want a sweet love story, you will likely really enjoy this book. If you also wanted some racey love scenes that raise the temperature to a boil, then this is not your book."
2,one of the worst books ive read in awhile,"Ive read Game for Seduction and really liked it...so i was anxious to read another book by her. But this one was terribly written--the plot, the heroine..everything! the heroine was so weak..and why did the author wait until the last 5 minutes to give her a backbone? i think the title itself is misleading as well..it should have been called The payback or something since the male main character seemed to say or think that every five minutes. Also maybe im naive or something but who meets a guy they havent seen in 10 years at a reunion, has sex with him the same night (at the reunion)--not even 10 minutes later.. and then follows him the next day? seriously?! and that was the beginning of my issue with this book. And her friend, Kate..ugh! its just a very poorly written book which i should have never bought."
2,"1.5 stars. Too much pondering, inaccurate assumptions, and unclear communication. Not recommended.","Opinion:Too much pondering their feelings, thinking about their situation rather than action, conversations and doing something. Several times Jason assumes Emma is lying which was not true - but merely a cheap device used by author to create conflict or plot. Most of the book is conflict due to the past and being separated. We don't get to see the developing relationship. Cover picture is wrong. The college is Stanford, not County. Jason has long hair not the short cut in the picture.Data:Story length: 278 pages. Swearing language: strong. Sexual language: strong. Number of sex scenes: 12. Setting: current day California. Copyright: 2007. Genre: erotic contemporary romance."
2,not recommended,The writting is good. I love Bella Andre but not this book! The main characters are happy for maybe five minutes.You'll end up spending the whole book in an aggitated state. Bella's a great author who has awesome books but this is not one of them.
4,"Good fit, but not for glasses","I like these headphones. They stay on well and sound good. I bought a pair for my daughter who runs with me sometimes and they don't work for her because she wears glasses. Sound is good, but not great. Could be the way I route it, but my only complaint is that sometimes the cord seems to tug at my ears as I run."
1,Didn't fit me properly,These headphones didn't fit me well. I was unhappy with the product and stopped using them. I went to the local store today and bought a different set to replace those.
3,Not bad,They do have ok sound quality and i guess the design is good for working out i guess but its kinda uncorfatable.....idk their ok
2,Tinny sound,"I got these because they were the cheapest around the ear earphones for running. They are the cheapest because the sound is really tinny. It is a bit like sitting next to that guy on the subway with leaky earphones. They do work, and if they fit better for you maybe they're ok. Or, if you are listening to an audiobook."
4,Sony MDR_J10 Clip-on Style Style Headphones,"dont like headphones on my head. I bought this over the ear style , earphone for comfort and convince. I am happy with them. Went to Amazon. com and purchased them. I am happy with my purchase.Thank you"
5,Great Value headphones for Sweaters,"These are not headphones for audiophiles, but they are not designed to be either.These headphones are designed for the active person who wants headphones for the gym, on the trail, at the track, etc. The fit is excellent and they stay in one's ears even during intense exercise (such as full out sprinting). There is also minimal collection of sweat around the ear/ in the ear canal (during intense workouts, this can obviously be negated by the use of a sweatband on the head).The sound quality is fair to good. Bass is lacking, but what do you expect out of earbuds, letalone a pair that costs under $10?!Durability is excellent. This is my second pair and the first lasted me for well over 1 year.Overall, these are very difficult to beat for the price (less than $10 as of August 2012), and I will buy them again when my pair finally fails."
1,Doesn't fit in your ear - can't hear anything!!,"Bought for use with iPod during excercise. Design around your ear works, but the driver only fits half way into the ear. This prevents you from hearing music. I tried to push in the driver, but it kept popping out. Terrible design. DO NOT BUY!! I usually like Sony equipment, but this item is awful."
3,You get what you pay for,"I was looking for a pair of cheap, decent earbuds or something over the ear. I saw these were only 8 bucks with free shipping, so I ordered 'em up, even seeing a lot of the negative reviews. The headphones themselves look nice, but the sound quality is not very good. Not dollar store bad, but very lacking on bass to be sure. I know these are cheap, but personally I'd spend at least 20 for something you'll actually like."
2,"Misleading ""non-slip"" title","Like many other reviewers, these headphones did not fit my ears well. They flopped around if I moved and were not ""non-slip"" as the name states. I had to return them due to the improper fit."
1,Electric shocks!!!!,"I bought a pair of these a few years ago and got rid of them. They kept shocking me. I thought it was the crappy laptop I had. Decided to give this style a try again, and you guessed it, same problem. Do not waste your money unless you like getting shocked in the ear every so often! (I would not recommend that!)"
5,Overall good.,"I thought these headphones were great! They lasted for about a year, then one side suddenly stopped working. I would recommend these headphones to anyone... from experienced musician to poor college kid."
2,Does NOT work!,"I had high hopes for these earphones after reading a couple of reviews, but I was very sadly disappointed when I tried them out. Either I have the world's smallest ears, or they are sized for someone with gargantuan ears. They flopped, fell off, and got tangled in my hair in the process. Even when I had them perfectly positioned (before running) they still didn't go anywhere near my ear canal, so if I was on a bus or subway everyone around me would have heard everything. Not good for a woman with normal-smallish ears."
2,Stay away from these headphones,"Very disappointed in the audio quality of these headphones. No bass whatsoever and the midrange is raspy and irritating! The all-plastic ear loops are not very comfortable. Save your money and your ears and buy theSony MDR-AS20J Active Style Headphones with Soft Loop Hangers - Black- which sounds great, have rubberized ear loops and a shirt clip for just a few bucks more."
4,Sony MDR-J10,"Compact,good ergonomics, very stable while exercising, fairly decent sound for size, great for the gym, seems sturdy, buying two more for gifts, recommended.."
2,So-So Headphones,"These are tremendously cheap, and you can tell. They are too light in your hand, and seem easy to break. I got these to have more secure headphones while I work out (as opposed to regular ear buds.) But they are not very secure on my ears, and with long hair, tend to get tangled.The sound quality is good, tho, for the price."
2,"Doesn't fit small ears, which I guess I have","Much has been said about these headphones, so I won't go into too much detail. I did want to mention two things:1. I had to return these earphones because they wouldn't stay on my ears at all. I've never had this problem with earphones before and was surprised.2. Another reviewer mentioned the slider that you can use to move the split point for the two headphones. It's there and it works, but the slider doesn't work all the way down the cord."
3,you get what you pay for,"Ear buds don't fit me, but I don't like full-sized headphones anymore. These are a pretty crappy solution. I'm in the market for their replacement."
5,Great! Would buy from again!,I bought these to replace my old headphones of a similar style and they're perfect if not better!
1,Terrible sound quality,MDR-J10 offers terrible sound quality. 0 bass and only treble. Sound gets distorted at even moderate volume. Not trying to boast but I think I can call myself an audiophile and I am terribly disappointed with these headphones. Just got them and I got so frustrated that I couldn't keep myself from writing a review. Now I need to pick up something with a good balance of treble-mid range-bass.
2,I've had it with these (4th pair)...,"Ok, I can't comment on the sound quality because I have no other earbuds to compare these too. Sound is sufficient and I never even doubted the quality...of the sound that is. As far as the actual hardware, there is an obvious deficiency in these earphones that needs to be imporved upon and/or fixed before they can keep marketing these.I'm on my fourth pair of these now, and EVERY SINGLE PAIR ive had has crapped out on me after about 4 or 5 months use. Its the same with every one. One of the earpieces will slowly deteriorate over the course of a day and then altogether break down. My left one just did this today, same exact thing happened with the other four pairs. I'm pissed because I keep buying these, and there's clearly a deficiency. Why do I keep buying them? Because they're 9 bucks and they fit and stay in my ear.Buy them to run and work out with for 4 months, but don't expect them to last any longer."
2,No bass.,"The headphones stay in place very well during jogging, workouts, etc. My major complaint is that they do not fit tightly in the ear and so all the sound is higher end tinny. There is absolutely no bass whatsoever."
2,"one ear does not = ""stereo...""","I was monumentally disappointed with these earphones. They're so stinking HUGE, I can't get them to stay on my ears, and my ears are really big!I'm actually considering dipping the hooks in boiling water to soften the plastic and try to get them to harden in a different shape, they're so useless right now. The right one won't stay in even when I'm sitting absolutely still - sometimes it just falls off. They both hang so loose, I don't get any bass or full volume. If I hold them in, the sound is good, though. I'd definitely test-drive a pair before buying these.Oh, and the rubber-coated, ""tangle-free"" cord is anything but! Hard plastic is much more tangle-free! The rubber just sticks to itself, and it's like trying to untangle hot, cooked spaghetti. :/I would also like these a lot more if they had a volume control. Come on, Sony, you cheap-Os..."
2,So Disappointed! Save your money!,"I've been through three pairs of these headphones, let me tell you why. The sound quality is amazing,I could have my music turned down but it would sound loud to me and there was no sound leakage. The over the ear clip works well. A few problems I have had with all three pairs is that the cord is so long it gets snagged on almost everything! There have been times when I've been on the bus and the cord would get snagged on other people...awkward. With the first pair, one of the earpieces stopped producing sound, so I bought my second pair. After 4.5 months the second pair did the same thing! Finally I bought my third pair,I loved the sound quality so much, and after 4 months both earpieces stopped working. My main point is save your money because these do NOT last long!"
1,Crap,"I had two expectations when purchasing this product:1. They would sound like crap, as one would reasonably assume of $10 headphones2. They would stay in my ears while runningThe first expectation was passed with flying colors. Fortunately I'm not looking for audiophile enlightenment while burning off a couple beers on the jogging path, so not a big deal there. The second expectation was a total failure though. Three runs in, these were unable to stay in or attached to my ears for more than 30 seconds. Frustrating junk, look elsewhere for running headphones."
1,Won't stay put!,I read the reviews and it seemed that generally people thought these things would stay on. For me the darn things keep falling off! I could not make them stay on my head for more than 5 minutes. A complete waste of time and money.
1,Well...,"They fit on my ears and they did not look too bad when they were in the box. Thats all the good I can say about this, these headphones are uncomfortable, sound horrible, have no bass at all, and the cord is very cheap, and flimsy. I know these are a 10 dollar pair of headphones, but I expected better from Sony. At least something that sounds like the cheap Apple Ear Buds, because these sound worse than those. Do yourself a favor and stay away from these.I bought these from my college bookstore."
5,Great for working out!,"These are great! Before I couldn't even pick up speed on the elliptical @ the gym without my old ear buds slowly slipping out, had to keep adjusting them. These are the opposite, very lightweight and comfortable. I can run, do jumping jacks, jump rope and they stay perfectly in place. Just what I was looking for! I wear them with eyeglasses with no problem. Sound quality with my Droid(I use as my mp3 player) wasn't as loud as it is with my laptop, so that must be phone related. Very great sound quality when used with my laptop, so loud and crisp I had to turn the volume down. No distortion at all, HIGHLY recommended!"
3,Not bad,"They work as expected for their cheap price. The con is that the left ear piece does not fit in the ear properly. It's a strange design I have never encountered before, but the right piece does fit in my ear perfectly.I have to use my hand to gently put pressure on the left before it's weird design enters the ear cavity enough, for sound to play clearly.The sound quality is not bad.. not as good as cheap behind the ear headphones I had, but they serve their purpose. I like that they are easily put into a pocket, and have that little collar that prevents the wires from tangling. I HATE TANGLED WIRES, and I'm wondering why that cheap little collar isn't put on more headphones. It wouldn't cost but a cent or two more to produce it this way.Construction wise, it is good quality as well.Over all, I am happy with them, but a little disappointed in the left ear piece, and the weird design."
2,Not Non-slip,"I was disappointed that the product does not live up to its name. As a jogger, I purchased these because I wanted to replace old ipod headphones with something more stable during my runs. These will within a few meters fall off my ear. I have taken to tucking them behind my sunglass temples for stability."
2,"Sounds fine, but just dangles on ear","The sound on these headphones is great sound like skullcandies. The fit on your ear is awful though, they just hang by a piece of plastic, dangling just close enough so you can really hear it. Because they are so lose on your ear and just hang, other people can hear it too, all around you. Cheap but not worth it for someone who wants a nice workout headphone."
5,Great for running,I got these just for running. They might not have the best sound quality but they can take a beating. I have had these over 6 months and they still work like the first day. I just stuff them everyday into my gym bag and forget about them until the next day. When these give out I will definitely buy again.
2,Super dissapointed,Love these type of headphones.... But they are way too big for a womans ear.. They are huge and fall off if I turn my head. For bigger ears only. Sound quality decent.. if they stay in your ear long enough for you to hear them.
3,Cheap!,"The picture looks a lot nicer, but when you see them in person they look very cheap. I purchased these because regular ear buds won't stay in my ears and if I do get them to stay they hurt. These stay like they are supposed to but the ear part still hurts my ear. The sound quality isn't bad for how cheap it is. As long as regular ear buds don't make your ears sore this product would probably work great."
4,Stays put. Sound matches price.,Bought them for running. They stay put just fine. Just what i wanted.Sound quality is about what i expected from <$10 headphones.
2,ok for the money,"though i didn't buy these headphones on amazon i still wanted to write a review . i have owned these once before and i thaought for the money that they were pretty good they lacked bass but i can live with that , i owned that pair for 2 years before they died . so i baought a second pair just a couple weeks ago and already the one driver is distorting at low volumes . dispite the problems i've had i would still tell people to buy them because of the price and sony is generaly a good brand ."
3,Well the headphones stay on while running,"The only reason I bought these headphones was so that I would have a pair that wouldn't fall off while running. Well they perform that well.However, I can't say they are the most comfortable pair of headphones. Since they are made to be a one size fits all, they do not fit snug on me. Since they do not fit snug, the sound quality suffers a bit.However, on the whole, they serve the purpose that I bought them for and the price was fair."
2,Sub par headphones,"You get what you pay for... the sound quality is mediocre and the head phones really don't stay in my ear. The trick is that yes, they do stay ON my ear, BUT the ear buds constantly fall out. I bought these head phones for running and exercising and I regret this choice. Although the headphones can still be used for other purposes these are not ideal for heavy motion activities."
1,Maybe my ears are too small...,"I was looking for a nice headphone to use during long-distance driving, and bought these (at a local store). They were a huge disappointment. Maybe my ears are too small (they sure don't seem like it), but the ""loop"" over the ear slipped off every two seconds and the actual speaker wasn't large enough to stay wedged in my ear. Needless to say, I returned these immediately."
5,headphones,These are the best headphones I have every owned. You only need minimal volume to get great sound. Sony has out done themselves.
2,Bad design,"Looks big around the ears,Very difficult to fit around the ears,Does not work with a pair of glasses (friction with the headphones when you run)."
3,Fine,"Work fine. They're cheapy headphones, no long review necessary.I wait to review products until they break. These lasted 7 months. After that one of the sides went out and required the whole bend-and-wiggle to get the headphone to work."
2,Makes my ears hurt/Sound is horrible,"I have had these earphones for about a month now. They are absolutely horrible and would not recommend buying.SOUND: After three weeks, the sound has become distorted on the left side.WEAR: When I put these on, they make my ears hurt after only ten to fifteen minutes.RECOMMENDATION: Spend another $5 dollars and get a better pair."
3,Better than what I was working with....but not the best,"These earphones were a welcome substitution for my ear buds I was using. They work well for running, but I switch back to ear buds when I'm doing other stuff (like biking or walking about). I've had negligible annoyances when I had to get these ear phones on and then arrange my sunglasses in a perfect way that won't push off the ear phones. Otherwise, these are cool for the price and again, I only use them for running."
4,Sony Headphones,I use these for running the only problem i have is sometimes they loosen in my ears. Also the cord is long and always gets yanked on my arm .But the sound is great and if there not for physical activites i would recommend them.
3,Sony MDR-J10 headphones with non-slip design,Great sound quality. Did not like the fit. It hurt the inside of my ear where it rests.
4,Great headphones!!,"Thes headphones are really great!! they always stay in your ear and are extremely comfortable, they have decent sound quality, way better sound than the headphones that come with the apple ipods."
1,not for small ears,I got these so I could jog and still listen to my ipod- bad mistake. I'll stick with my earbuds for now... They are way too big and will not stay on. Maybe if you've got ears size XL they'll stay on.
4,Perfect! ... except...,"I've had 8+ of these pairs for the past decade or so, and they last on average for about 1 year. When they break, it's almost always a cord problem, which cuts the sound in and out of one or both ears. It usually happens after I've jerked the cord after it's accidentally hooked onto something.I had 1 pair of the MDR-J20 and although I never had the same sound problem, the cord was thinner and flimsier and eventually exposed the wires underneath.I really like the sound and I LOVE the fit of both h.Ear styles, but since neither seem to last very long, I might now try something different, which is a shame."
3,Cost effective headphones,"I purchased these headphones because I don't like the ear bud phones that come with MP3 players. The hook goes over your ear and doesn't slip off. Reminds me of putting glasses on by hooking one ear at a time. With all the headphones to choose from, these are a good purchase for the price."
3,Great if you don't sweat,"They fit this 30yr old male perfectly. Sound quality was fitting to price. My main reason for buying these was to use when I run. Sold as a 'sport' headphone, they last about 15 minutes of jogging until sweat starts randomly shutting them down. Very disappointed considering I run between 30-40 minutes. I am considering buying a second pair to plug in half way through my run."
2,Bad for exercising,"I purchased these headphones and they are terrible for running. The first time that I used them they didn't stay in my ears, and could barely hear my music. They have weak bass, and don't have a very good range. I bought some behind the neck ones instead, I am still waiting for them, but I know that those are of a higher quality than these."
1,They shocked my ear,"They fit fine, the sound was fine. But during my 3rd use, on the treadmill, they shocked my right ear. I thought it was my imagination so I kept going... and it did it again. I have since searched ""shocked"" in these reviews and guess what... I'm not the only one!! A definite DON'T BUY."
2,"Ok ergonomics, terrible sound","I bought these to use when running, and they do fit on my ears (though they're a bit big) and stay in place. However, the sound on these is truly terrible. Tinny like an old fashioned AM radio. Very disappointing. And I don't think my expectations are too high. Comparing these to other $10 Sony headphones I've had (the kind with the earbuds that look like these, but with a headband instead of the around-the-ear clip), the sound is nowhere near as good.They get two stars for being cheap enough to be virtually disposable, but for listening to music these headphones border on unusable. Beware."
4,The ultimate design.,i have had at least 6 pairs of these sony head phones through out my lifetime. The only downfall is just how easy they get snagged on stuff.
3,Product Review,"They are decent. They aren't real comfortable and they fall out of your ears constantly when running. Other than these two things, the product is A okay."
3,"Average Comfort, Decent Sound","Product is adequate for the money. I tried them for use while I sleep, which is what I bought them for, but found them uncomfortable. The sound is pretty good, though."
2,"good for a while, won't stand up to high activity for long","This is the second pair I've owned that have stopped working on one side. I thought perhaps it was user-error the first time, having caught my hand in the wire and yanked it a bit hard. But the second pair has gone the same way.Too bad, to. They seemed to stay in play under heavy activity (running, mountain trail hiking) better than others, but won't hold up over time.I got a good 8 months out of this last pair."
4,Grammy loves these headphones!,"I'm a grandmother, 64, and just bought my 1st ipod which I had, frankly resisted [my CDs were just fine, thank you] - I love the ipod! I did NOT love earbuds [I tried several different kinds] - they kept falling out of my ears. Yes, I know they look cool and YOUNG, but I lean more to comfort now. These headphones are comfortable [and I occasionally wear glasses!] with good sound, inexpensive - I would definitely recommend."
2,Bad fit. Didn't like them. Sent them back.,"After reading reviews about how great these clip-on headphones were, I was rather disappointed to find how uncomfortable and ill-fitting they are. I don't think my ears are any different from the average person, and these headphones just refused to fit properly or comfortably. Perhaps if they'd been bendable, they'd have been okay. As it was, however, the actual piece that I thought was supposed to fit into your ear ended up sitting right outside of it. It was more like having little tiny speakers sitting just behind the opening of my ears, as opposed to the way normal earbuds are supposed to fit. This caused the sound quality to deteriorate to a level similar to what you get when you hear music blaring out of normal headphones... when you don't actually have them on.Needless to say, I returned these and went with something else."
3,I bought a few different brands ...,"Even after reading all the reviews, I wound up buying 3 different models ... Sony MDR-J10 Black, Sony MDR-J11g, and Koss KSC22.Both Sony models are similar in sound, but the MDR-J11g has a better quality feel to it, and the plastic housing seems stronger. They both fit my ears good, and speaker fits into the ear canal and stays there no matter how much jumping around I do. I can't see these falling off during a jog.However, the Koss seems a better choice out of the three. The sound is clearer and the earpiece has a foam cover which makes it comfortable when I'm wearing it for extended periods. Also, the metal clip is easily bendable so I can make it conform to my ear perfectly, and it won't fall off no matter what.I tend to lean toward Sony products when purchasing electronics, and the Sony headphones have a nice, futuristic appearance. But I have to go with practicality, good sound, and comfort on this review ... so Koss is my favorite of the three."
1,Bad headphones,"Think twice before you buy these non-slip headphones. I was very disappointed with the fit of these headphones. They are design for specific type of ears and if you don't have those ears, forget it! How do you know if you have the right size ears? You just don't know until you try them on and realize they don't fit. They are truly uncomfortable and not very flexible. Save your money and find something else. Don't buy them because of the low price. There is a reason for the low price. Who wants them!"
2,Buy a CD instead.,"These looked cool for those walks around the block, and the price was right. But that's as good as it gets. They may not bring down the neighborhood, but they bring down the once-proud name of Sony. Not only is the sound of music sharp, tinny, and bass-deprived, but the pin never seems to lodge securely in my player, leading to distortion and the cutting out of sound in one of the headphones.My wife recently purchased a comparable pair of Brookstones at the airport. They cost three times more, but they sound at least three times better."
3,A little too big,"I have average sized ears and these headphones were way too big. They didn't securely wrap around my ears, they just kind of dangled off of them. Not the ""No slip"" I was hoping for."
4,Good sound without trying,"Stays in my ears fairly well, which is not something most headphones of this type do. Also, the sound quality is great for activity or outdoor use. Good for the morning run!"
1,Painful and bad sound.,"Hurt my ears and sound awful. When running, they literally bounce the sound and it is nauseating. Waste of money."
4,Sony Headphones MDR-J10,"This a great product for its price....They are very comfortable for those that can not wear the in-ear kind of headphones like in my case. The sound is very good, but they lack on the low frequencies(bass)....that is the reason I gave a four star to the product."
3,mediocre,"Tend to slip around when plastic gets wet (from sweating). No bass, very tinny sound. Whistling sound when running. More secure if you keep the cord in front of you and run on a treadmill with no airflow through them. Reasonably comfortble when not slipping around. For $7.00 hard to complain. I will stick my over the ear rear band headphones (Sony MDR-G45LP) for jogging outside. They dont look as cool, but they fit great and sound decent."
2,Too big for my ears,"I am a fairly petite female, and these headphones were much too big for my ears. I got them to wear at the gym, and they were bouncing around on my ears as I was running. I constantly had to adjust them. I returned them after the first time wearing them. The sound was good and for biking or sitting at home they would probably work but they did not work for me for active fitness."
3,Always Adjusting,"The sound is great but they do not stay on my ears at all! I am constantly putting them back in and adjusting them while running. For now, I just deal with it but when I replace them, I will choose a different design."
1,Groundphones,"Saw the reviews here, figured 4 stars means they work.Nope. They slide out within the first few steps of running. Try jamming them in your ear, and they fall out after a few more. Garbage for their purpose. The box says the 'clip on style provides secure fit'... except they don't clip onto anything, certainly not your ears.Save your ten bucks and get something else."
1,Whose ears are these made for?,"Cheap and still not worth the money I paid. When you hook them over your ears, the buds point to the front of your ear (picture the light on a miner's cap) not down to the inside (ear canal). I tried them on every way possible and couldn't make them point where they were supposed to point. The product description says they isolate sound, but there is no way that can happen without fitting in to your ear canal so the description is not truthful. I recommend buying a non-slip design that is adjustable in some way and not to waste your time or money on these."
3,"Good, not great","They stay on and are comfortable enough, just what you need for a workout. The sound quality isn't great but these are inexpensive and good enough for workout headphones."
3,Ok,"This product arrived on time from the seller. I havent had the chance to use it yet, but for the price it seems to be a good buy."
1,hard plastic loops that are uncomfortable and don't fit my ears :(,"These did not work out for me at all :(I know I have smallish ears, but I didn't think they were *that* abnormal... ;)I needed a new set of headphones for when I go out running. I like the kind that hooks over the ear, because I find that they stay put better than the little knobby ones. I got these because I really liked the color =P and because I trust Sony as a brand.Unfortunately, these didn't fit my ears at all. The plastic is pretty hard and had some rough edges, so I was afraid I was hurting my earlobe when I tried to put them on. Once they were on, I bounced up and down a few times, and that's when they just fell off. That's no good, I wanted to take these on longer (bouncier) runs!I ended up getting a pair of Phillips headphones instead."
2,Unreliable,"I've purchased several pairs of these headphones because they're cheap and will stay in my ears while running and doing yard work. The sound quality is decent at best but wasn't a problem since this wasn't very important to me. The real problem with these headphones is that they're seemingly programmed to break down after 90 days. Each pair that I bought stopped working after that amount of time. And for the do-it-yourselfers, they're not easy to fix. I'm pretty good with a soldering iron but it seems that once they break down they won't work ever again.Final advice: don't buy these headphones if you plan on running with them because they WILL BREAK DOWN."
2,My ears must be too small,My husband loves these head phones so I finally bought my own pair. Unfortunately they don't work for me. They won't stay in my ear even with the band that fits behind. I guess I will keep looking for the perfect ones for me.
3,"Non-slip, not really","The headphones are loud enough, and comfortable enough to utilize during walking around the house events. I purchased them to workout, therein lies the problem. I have normal ears, and apparently I need a set like Will Smith for these to stay on. Other than that, they are a nice set for the price."
2,They won't stay in!,"I bought these for running. Not a good idea. They won't stay on/in my ears for more than a few steps. Granted, my ears stick out a bit, but it's not like I'm Will Smith. Don't buy these for running. The sound is great, so if you're not going to move at all, feel free to buy them."
4,Great headphones for activities,"These Sony headphones are great for running or biking because once on your head they almost disappear and become a part of you. Their sound which is very good, (less bass than noise-isolating units that fit into the ear canal) but still allow you to hear outside sounds like cars for safety. Good price for a well designed unit."
2,Good headphones but not durable,"Overall, I really liked these headphone. They stayed on my ears when I was running or biking and produced a sound quality that I was more than happy with for working out. I would have given them a much better review, but it hasn't even been a month since I purchased them and the wire where it plugs in to the device has shorted out and I can only get audio out of one earphone now. I have not put these through any kind of extreme use. I would consider it to be moderate use, so I'm very disappointed that they've broken so quickly. Not worth the money."
2,Headphones review,"It was nice and cheap, what is not great about it is, when I am running hard it slowly slips out of my ear and kinda dangles. It feels annoying when trying to concentrate and run fast. I am not pleased with the product"
3,"Great value, but definitely not non-slip","I bought these headphones since I run and need a pair that won't fall out when I'm running. I have smaller-than-average ears, so seeing the ""non-slip"" description made me think these headphones were exactly what I needed...nope. These headphones fall off my ears even faster than my current headphones. It might be due to my ear size, but the headphone material is smooth plastic, not exactly ""non-slip"" material. Not even the part that goes in your ear has rubber on it, so it's not really a surprise that they fall out so easily. For non-running purposes, these headphones are a pretty good value since they were so cheap."
3,Don't buy these if you have small ears,"These headphones are all right, but are not meant for people with small ears. A man might have better luck with them than I do. I wear them when I'm working in the field in a tractor, but they will barely stay on my ears. After awhile they become uncomfortable, as well. I think they would probably sound okay if they did not stay so far away from my ol' earholes.I have to keep shoving the earbud up close to hear anything. Aggravating."
2,Kept falling off,"Overall the quality for these headphones were ok, but due to the design you have to put the volumn pretty high in order to hear. Also, the main reason why I brought these were because they were the wrap-around version, which I hoped would have helped them stay on while running...no such luck. After wearing them 2 times, I have to return them. Not only are they bulking, they don't stay on."
2,Do not stay on ears,"Good sound, but these do not stay on my ears. I like how they are structured, and they would be very comfortable if they would just be a little more secure. I definitely don't recommend these for running, but they would be okay for walking."
4,Not the best headphones but useful,"I bought this headphones because the ones that came with my mobile, slip when I do any cardio exercise (except static bike =p).I read some reviews and some people said that they were almost perfect because they didn't slip.Maybe are my ears (one of them, they are like 3.5cm) but they doesn't fit very well, they kinda slip even if I adjust them.Sound quality is great but not excellent, is not that you're going to have a 7.1 on your ears!, not even a 5.1 (some people expect almost that on headphones) but works fine with stereo and surround or DNSe. I repeat, is not that they are perfect but for the price, I think that you can't ask for more.For the price I think they are right: sound quality and design."
2,They don't stay in your ears for running!!!!,The headphones sound descent but they don't stay in your ears for running. Nuff Said........
4,Word great!,These earphones work much better than the ones that came with my ipod. They are a little large for my ears but still they work fine.
2,"Hard Plastic, really?","These are made one suze not adjustable, hard ungiving plastic, THEY HURT !!! gave them to a friend with larger ear holes!"
1,Bad Choice,"The sound quality is not great at all and I'm not even listening to music. I bought these strictly for transcription and it's not clear at all. Plus, they're made strange. It took some time to get them to actually stay in my ear and to wrap around my ear. Maybe my ear lobes are too small or something. Anyway, don't like them at all and threw them in a corner. I'm still looking."
2,Not very good,"I tried these. I can only list one pro and one con.Pro: very comfortableCon: no bassIf you're like me and like a lot of bass, pass on these."
3,Would be great if it was actually the color described . . .,"I love these headphones, and when I saw them in Green, I thought it would be perfect to go with my girlfriend's iPod mini. Twice I ordered these headphones, and they came in black instead. And Amazon.com customer service said there was nothing more they can do."
3,not for small ears!,"I tried these on in a best buy today prior to ordering - don't get them if you have small ears! My ears are ""cute"" small and the wrap around part is WAAAAY too big for my ears. the top part didn't even touch the top of my ears - there was probably another 1/2"" of clearance. :(The actual earbud piece felt like it would be great for running or biking with, since it didn't ""plug"" my ears. I felt like I would still be able to hear traffic."
5,Great Headphones,These headphones are just great! They are much better sound quality than the ones that came with my iPod and they are much more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. They are great and I would buy them again and give them ten stars if I could.
2,Great Headphones But.....,"I am absoultely addicted to music. one would be hardpressed to find me without headphones in my ear ever; even during classes.i bought these headphones twice. when i got them, the sound quality was absolutely amazing and the fit was nice. but before one month was up, the wire for the right headphone became loose. the second time i bought them, the same thing happened but it took slightly longer to become loose.these are great headphones for the price but if you except to overuse your ipod or whatever you have, try to get more sturdy headphones."
2,Difficult to wear,"I bought these because I've had very good experiences with this style of headphones in the past. However, these headphones are very difficult to wear and will not stay on my ears no matter how I position them. I even have problems with them falling out when I'm just sitting at my desk. My intent was to use these headphones when I go walking or running, but there's no way they can work for that because they keep falling out!"
3,"Headphones OK, Service Excellent","I was looking for a new pair of headphones for working out, walking and running. For some reason, earbuds do not stay in my ears so I was looking for something to keep the headphones in my ears. I chose these earphones because they were not large in size and looked comfortable. The part that goes around your ear is made of hard plastic- I thought it might be more flexible. When running, I have a very hard time keeping the earphones completely in my ears. I have to keep the headphone wires ahead of me (I like to throw them over my back to keep them out of my way) and I have to keep pushing the earphones back in. The sound quality is OK. The company I purchased the earphones from were excellent about saying I could return the headphones, however, at $7, I figured it would cost more than it was worth than to just keep them and maybe get another pair."
1,only works on one side,Only the right side works normally. The left side only emits sound if you hold the cord in a particular position - and not even then does it always work.
3,Very Durable Head phone...,"Very Durable Had mine for 2 Years. Until...I loan it to my ""FRIEND"", which he said his Dog Chew it all up, I never saw the evidence.. hmmm.Anyways: Positives . Hard to break, No shorting out of the cord at anytime. lol that it for me.Negatives . Hard on the ear cant ware it too long. Almost Zero Base. Fit ok but because its not in your ear it slips out now and then.I love headphone Earphone which push to star trying out some new product at a reasonable cost. I do own a Beat Studio(Best headphones EVER!) but i need something a little bit more pocket size so my next interest is ""MEElectronics M6-CL"" Reviews are great on it so i cant wait to try them out."
2,poor,"I ordered these for travel. I discovered they were hard to stay on the ear. And only one worked; the other did not. Poor quality; expected more from the ""sony"" brand."
3,Good sound and fit but not durable,"This must be my 5th or 6th headphones of this model. I like them for the gym and I have been using only them for my workout for over 3 years. The sound is nice and crisp, the grip on my ear is perfect. BUT one of them will shutdown after few months...it's been always the same scenario for all the ones I had. If it could just last longer! it would be the best."
2,Fall off while running,"I bought these because I was looking to replace the ones that came with my mp3 player. I was encouraged by the reviews that they would stay put while running....I guess I just have really small ears? These were horrible! My normal, non-sport earbuds stay in my ears longer than these did! I didn't need yet another pair of regular headphones. I needed some that would stay put when I run. These do not. The ear loop is too big and the actual earbud does not go in your ear (which I liked in theory so you can hear cars, etc), so it just slips off. :(If you have big ears, they probably work just fine, but they were way too big for me and no way to compensate for that. I am not a small person, either, so I don't know who they made these to fit...Overall: these suck for running"
3,great while it works,"These are a great pair of headphones particularly for the price. However, there is one major flaw to them. They break after about 3 months. This is the second pair of these headphones that I have bought and the last pair did the exact same thing. The right headphone simply stops working. On the last pair the cord became slightly damaged and exposed so them breaking is explainable, however this time around I made sure to not let that happen and yet it still broke.If you dont mind handing out $15 every 3 months or so then yeah these are great headphones. But personally I dont think I will be buying these again unless I cannot find a different pair that will actually last."
2,"You get what you pay for, unfortunately","I've seen others on this site who've experienced the same 'failing after 3 months' diagnosis as I have. At first I wondered if I was treating them roughly (I bike with them and sometimes stuff them away in a spare pocket) but it seems that they're simply cheaply made. They might be a worthy investment if you decide to splurge on a case to protect them, but otherwise I would say upgrade to a more pricey alternative."
3,too big for my ears,"These headphones are comfortable until you start jumping around. The clip part is far bigger than my ear, so the headphones bounce around and fall off when I run. I ended up buy sony headphones that go over your head and like them much better."
2,One bud ALWAYS fails after 3-4 months,"These buds never cease to annoy me. For some reason I keep buying them, possibly since my gym sells them. I promised myself these would be my last. I'll write a sufficiently bad review to cement it....They always seem just fine for the first 3 or 4 months. The sound is alright and they stay on my ears while running; I wish the buds stayed tightly in my ears rather than ""floating"" just outside the canal though. Otherwise, they work well enough.Then -- ALWAYS 3 or 4 months after I buy them, one ear bud stops working! This has happened with at least 3 pairs in a row now. How cheap. I am very disappointed that Sony would make a product that systematically fails after 3-4 months... which is suspiciously just long enough to make the warranty invalid.Do not buy these unless you want to buy new ones every 4 months. I'm going to try the slightly-more-expensive but well-rated Sound Squared buds next."
3,good for a while,"I've owned 3 pairs of these headphones or the equivalent earlier models. Primarily I used them with an ipod on the treadmill. The sound is great for the price, and they stay in place on my ears even when I'm sprinting, which most bud-like earphone do not. They were also comfortable enough to wear studying etc. But these are primarily for working out so audiophiles no need to bash their sound quality.The only problem I've had is after about 6-8 months one side ceases to work, so just a warning that they might not last too long for you (a problem among most cheap earphone). I still feel like I got my nine dollars worth!"
2,Not for running...,"These headphones sound great and at first fitting feel very secure. However, once you start running and bouncing, they will practically fall off your head and dangle from your ear. I'm not sure what non-slip means. Anyway, if you are looking for comfortable headphones that sound pretty good and you aren't planning to run with them, go for it."
5,The best affordable ones I've had.,"I've been buying these for years now--they last about a year, but that's more than most other inexpensive pairs I've had. Earbuds never stay in my ears, over-the-ear headphones give me a headache from their weight...these are the best and most comfortable ones I've had. Plus they travel well! You can roll up the cord around your iPod and tuck the hooks into the roll...compact and ready to go. I'm ordering two though so I can have them for a while. :)"
1,Don't buy these!!!,"If these things stay on your ears, you are either a dog or you have large ears. I am a normal sized female (5'4"" 118lbs) was hoping to find a pair that would stay in place. These do not, although I did not spend as much of my run messing with them they did fall off frequently during the floor and weight training parts of my routine.The sound quality is awful. There is absolutely no bass. Which is essential for workouts. I am so disappointed in these headphones I have not noticed if the tangle free cord works or doesn't. First Sony product I have ever bought that was not worth the money. Do yourself a favor and keep shopping!"
3,So-So,"I bought these because I started running vs. using the elliptical and the cord would go all over the place. I figured if they went around my ears, and suggested they are ""non slip"", they would be perfect! It could be due to the fact my ears aren't extreemly large, but these fit very loose around my ears and the sligest movement of the cord will pull them away from my head simply because nothing is keeping them held on. If I push my hair out of my face, one will fall off. I started wearing my old ear buds again. Other than that, the style is cool and it was very fast shipping so I am giving it 3 stars!"
2,Not as good as they seem,"The sound quality is 5.5/10. They seem cool but sound like some old speakers. I chose the Sony over the Philips ones and I think the Philips would've been much better, but I haven't tried them."
2,Warning they might shock.,"I bought these pair of headphone because I have a good history with sony products and with good reason. They felt good in the ears, the sounds was good, and the price was one of the best things about it. While at school I noticed there was a buzzing sound coming from the right side. At first I thought it was just the headphones moving around in the headphone jack, so I ignored it. A little later I start hearing these loud sparking noises coming from my head phones and take them off, I don't know what may have caused this but I thought I was going to be shocked in the inside of my ear. I still hear sparking noises coming from my headphones but I see no real sparks when looking at it. Either way I am not risking getting shocked in the ear."
3,"Fit is decent, audio leaves something to be desired.","The fit of these headphones is fine - the buds sit gently in the ear, but not far enough in to create pressure (my biggest issue with earbuds, which hurt my ears), plus they let a little outside noise in, which is best for running outside.However, while the audio comes through very clearly, it's like listening to music with bass all the way down and treble all the way up. High notes, the hiss of an S, and any sharp noises are headache-inducing for me. Everything sounds tinny and since I use them with my shuffle (no treb/bass settings) there's no way I can try to resolve this. While I wasn't expecting high quality sound out of these (they're $8, after all), these are ultimately a pretty big flop for me."
3,pretty good but hard on the ears,I had a similar styled pair of these earphones that I lost and they were less rigid. These work but if you wear them for long periods of time they tend to make your ears sore. I also guess that depends on the size of your ears.
4,Pretty Good,The earphones sound decent and and look nice. I can't keep regular buds in my right ear. These stay put even I'm being active. Great not to have to keep putting one back in my ear all the time.
1,Don't buy these!,"These are not comfortable, not flexible, too expensive. They hurt my ears. So not worth the money. Save up and buy quality headphones."
3,OKAY,The earpieces are hard to fit and not as comfortable as I had hoped. Better idea than the execution seems to be.
3,"Good, but can be better","I am reading so many good reviews here for this one..but the search for ""my"" perfect ear phone is still ON...While its definitely made my life better as I can jog with these but it still does not fit my ears and falls out if I don't adjust.Having said that I could never jog or even walk with the regular earphones!"
4,Loved it,Stocking stuffer for my daughter. She jogs and loves it. Does not have to reinsert into her ears while running.
2,Ear bud is too large,"The part that sticks into your ear is very large and keeps popping out of my ear. The part that goes over my ear is also very small. It works for me, but if you have large ears, I could see it not fitting. I don't think I would ever recommend these to anyone."
1,Bad Quality,just got these... I don't care about quality i am using them temporarily but get something else.there are other cheap headphones with better quality.
4,Very functional,I gave these to my son for Christmas. He really likes them. They are comfortable in his ears. They seem to be sturdy too.
2,Broke Quickly,"After about a week at the gym, these headphones broke. They did the thing where sound only comes out of one side. There was no sort of traumatic impact with them and I think they are just cheap."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought these because I wanted something cheap to run with that would be comfortable, so I got these. I knew straight up that the sound quality wouldn't be great, but it's satisfactory; I'm able to listen to music with them and that's about it.But when I opened up the package I read a notice basically saying ""There's going to be static with these headphones. To reduce it, wear natural fibers clothing"" or something like that. Wait what? If I don't want static, I need to wear different clothes? Look, the reason I bought these headphones was because I didn't want to spend a lot of money. So I disregarded the notice and when I wore them...static. There was a lot of static. I just ended up throwing them away.You pay barely anything for headphones and you're going to get cheap quality headphones. I'm just going to buy some different ones that are better quality, it'll be worth the money."
3,Tinny Sounding,"I only had them for a week before I left them, along with an MP3 player, on the hood of my car and lost them both. While I did have them, they were quite comfy, but the sound quality was pretty poor. As the subject line says, they were very tinny sounding. I wanted something I could listen to while cruising on my scooter, but between the poor sound quality and traffic noise, they were useless. And there's something about my ears where any size ear buds won't stay in my ears. If you're looking for comfort, and nice looking earphones, then this is for you. If you want good sound quality, nuh uh."
4,good,good headphones. I use them while i work and do other physical activities. I have broken lots of headphones and these ones have out lasted a lot of them so far so im happy
2,Just as loose as earbuds,"I am one of those people who cannot wear earbuds. My left ear opening is apparently too big to hold one in, and my right ear barely gets by. I bought these hoping I could wear them while jogging. However, the hook over the ear is too loose, and gravity is not enough to hold them on, and I swear I do not have a bouncy stride. I can wear them around the house, but that's it."
3,Meh,"They cost 10 bucks and that's what they're worth. For the cheap price, they do their job. The sound quality gets a little funky when you move the 1/8th jack in whatever device you're using. They do fit pretty good though. I suppose I would recommend them to someone if they wanted just a cheap pair of headphones. I only use mine for when I workout, so I don't really hear the drawbacks that often."
3,If you wear glasses,"Don't get these if you wear glasses, they will not work together. They are somewhat comfortable without glasses, pretty mediocre fitting I would say. I would probably get a different pair if given the chance"
2,annoying fit,"I can't seem to find a pair of earbuds that will stay in my ears while I am jogging. I bought these hoping the design would stay in place. Unfortunately, they flop around, even when I am just walking. They also produce less volume than other earphones I use. Unless you press these up against your ears, the sound is tinny and lacks bass. Besides that, because of the design the cord does tend to get tangled up withe the earpieces. I will stick with earbuds for stationary listening and have purchased a set of headphones (Maxell HB-210) that wrap around my head to use while exercising."
1,Worst headphones I've ever owned,"Earbuds don't fit in my ears. I thought these would be a viable alternative. Here's the deal. The clip is one size fits all. If your ear is not this size, too bad. The earbuds are not designed to fit snugly in your ears. If the clip doesn't fit , then the earbuds will constantly and annoyingly slide out of your ears. When I held my hands to the side of my head, it sounded great. Otherwise I couldn't hear even with the sound turned completely up. If you buy these keep the receipt."
1,Nice ear phones but WRONG color !!!!,I ordered the green earphones but got a dark pair. You would think you would get the color you ordered. I am not so happy about my order. I just wish I had gotten the correct color.
5,best ive ever owned,the arrival was speedy and these are the best pair of headphones ive ever purchsed
2,Terrible Headphones by Sony,I am very particular about my music quality and I thought that buying thes sony headphones might be ok and possibly the only ones that stay in my ears. How wrong I was. They are uncomfortable and the quality of sound is apalling. Don't buy them.
2,Too much plastic,"These head phones are good for keeping track of traffic sounds when you're on your bike or jogging. However they should have routed the cables over the ears with that plastic up there. By having the cables come straight down with the hard plastic it tends to interfer with the bike helmet. Quite a bit of windnoise from them, but they are open air non isolating so I guess they didn't promise to be noise free at 20+mph on a bike anyway. I'm not real impressed. I'll probably take them back to wal-mart after one use."
1,Terrible. Returning after a couple of hours,"These are the worst headphones. After a couple of hours, I am already going to return them. Th sound quality is terrible and there is a static background noise. Also, because they are so large and heavy, they begin to hurt your ears after a while. I did not want expensive headphones before I bought these, but if this pair portends the quality of cheaper headphones, then cheaper is worse."
1,terrible running earphones,"These are giant earphones. I took them out of the box, put them on, ran in place for less than 30 seconds (I bought these for running and the ""secure grip"") and they fell out after about ten steps of jogging in place. I wish I hadn't bought them."
1,sony headphones,Guess these are made for people with big ears cause I can't use them as they just keep falling off.
1,Electric Shock in the EAR !!!,"After using them for 1 month, and now they are giving me electric shocks... yes yes..electric shocks...its crazy.. I hate these earphones.. HOW can sony make a product and not test it well.Please dont buy these.."
1,Sony Athletic headphones start good but end bad,"Just like another reviewer, the EXACT SAME PROBLEM has occured to me in EVERY SINGLE PAIR I'VE OWNED! For about $10 lowest retail price, $12 dollars highest, these things have lasted at least 3 months, and at most a year, until the LEFT earbud simply shuts off. The wire leading in to the earbud either comes loose, or dissolves with use. If I held the wire at odd angles, the earbud would work, but otherwise it is simply finished."
2,Lucky if they work for you ...,"I bought these hoping to have a back-up for my current favorite headphones, which are so comfortable I didn't realize how spoiled I had been. I couldn't wear these, they were too stiff (I like the flexible plastic ones) so first off they hurt my ears = no good, second due to the bad fit, I couldn't hear anything. Now I rated this with two stars because my husband actually uses them. They seem to fit him. So I'm glad they are getting use, but I am still disappointed. I'd suggest looking at other, softer plastic headphones."
1,If only I could rate it 0...,"There were the worst purchase I've made and I can only wish that I had read all of the reviews before I bought them. They're horrible.1. They don't fit into my ears. While this may sound like a small thing considering they ""clip on"" the fact that they don't fit IN means that either (a) I'm stuck straining to hear my music or (b) by the end of a twenty minute train ride my ears are sore and I still have more than half and episode of Lost to go.2. I've experienced MAJOR sound issues. With my old iPod ear buds sounds would flow seamlessly from one to the next with constant consistant volume and quality. With these I've experience a tinny noise as well as fluxuation in volume. I'm not sure if this is an issue between Sony and iPod, all I know is it sucks.If you haven't discerned this already: DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES."
2,Less than desirable,"I bought these earphones because I wanted something non-slip and without a headband. They meet that requirement, but that's about it. The sound is quite tinny and there's very little bass response unless you shove the speaker-portion further into your ear, and even then it's less than I want.I also noticed that if I smile, the shape of my ears change enough that they don't fit right, and actually hurt my ears. Sure, they stay on my ears, so they fit that bill. Other than that, I certainly wouldn't recommend them."
2,"Three pairs, same outcome, these suck!","My husband and I purchased these earphones after reading the great reviews on this product, and after 6 months, the left ear went out on BOTH pairs. Of course, I figured, since my husband is bad on products, perhaps it was something we did. Later, I purchased another set, specifically for my office at work. In 6 months time the left ear went out again. Ridiculous. Since they were only used at work, I CAN'T imagine that it was fault of the user this time. The only conclusion I have come to, is that these earphones although look fantastic, are not great headphones."
3,"Doesn't fit my ears, but work for my wife","The shape of my ears make it impossible for me to use regular bud-type earphones. I bought these hoping that they would fit and work for me. When they hang on my ear, the actual phone part hangs at the wrong height to fit into my ear canal.The sound seems pretty good and they appear to work for my wife."
3,Good enough,"The headphones have a tendency to slip on my ear so that the buds are no longer inside my ear, and therefore do not deliver sound as well, and I have to continually readjust them. Still they are the ONLY ones I have tried (I have gone through about 5 pairs) that will stay on and not fall off while I jog, so that counts for something."
2,for some ears only,"The generally positive reviews about sound quality and fit spurred me to buy this product, and I found that they were much too loose for my ears. I'm happy with the sound quality and whatnot, but I've gained minimal utility from this purchase, perhaps because my ears are not of the standard size. If you suspect your ears are similarly non-typical, I suggest going with something else. I did give these to my boyfriend, who has lovely, and probably normally-sized ears, and he commends their quality."
4,Second time to buy these,"I like these personally, not for the high quality of the sound or the product but because even when I am running into the wind they don't move. I have tried other headphones (even ones Sony called sports headphones) but they move with a slight breeze not to mention running. These hurt a little b/c they pinch the back of your ears but I say as long as they do not move who cares!Hope this helps you in your search for good headphones. . . Enjoy and keep the fires burning (if you know what it means then we are automatically friends)"
3,Nice sound quality but irritates ears after a while,"The quality of soung is good, and hangs on the ear pretty well during the workout. But once you start sweating, headphones start irritating your ears and beats the whole purpose of sports head phones!"
3,Sony headphones for ipod,"Somebody else wrote a review of these that is exactly what these headphones turned out to be: Perfect if you don't want them falling off your ears, but just adequate in terms of sound quality. If I sit and hold them into my ears, the sound is a lot better, but they don't hang that way naturally. I would love a set that molded to the ear better; this is not that set."
4,good headphones,"the sound quality is good, the length of the cord is especially nice so that i'm not constrained to sitting super close or hunching over my computer when they're plugged in. only negative is that the around-the-ear part is a little bit, so they don't always fit snugly. usually this can be fixed by getting my hair out of the way, but they sometimes still slip. not great for gym use, but good for home or office."
2,Not even worth the $10 I paid for them,"I bought these off Amazon for $10 to use as my back up headphones for exercising. My pair may have been defective, but the product did not stay in my ears even with the wrap around addition. The volume was not great, especially if you are using them for running in a congested area. I would spend 10 more dollars and get the pair ofSennheiser PMX70 Sport Line Stereo Neckband Headphonesfeatured on Amazon for just under $20. The Sony are a little more durable because they have bendable parts (I broke my first pair of Sennheiser's by jamming them into my gym bag each day), but the Sennheiser offers a way better sound and feel."
2,Keep looking if you're looking to hear your music,"Now granted, I didn't expect perfection.They're headphones.But it's SONY for crying out loud, you'd think you could expect at least decent sound...Well, to be clear, the sound is *fine*... if you cram these as far as possible into your ears and turn the sound waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay up.Bought these for my iPod, and they're not going to work, but working just fine for listening to the radio at work without the earbud popping out every 2 minutes, thus the 2 stars.Keep looking if you're looking for good music headphones though!"
2,Poor headphones,"I shouldn't expect much from $10 headphones, but these are really, really bad. I am not an audiophile beyond any stretch of the imagination, but music just sounds awful, like listening to a mono speaker. It's more annoying than enjoyable. There is absolutely 0 bass. And I can't wear them for more than 5 minutes sitting at my desk before my ears throb in pain. They do seem durable though, so that's why 2 stars. But I do NOT recommend them."
4,just what i wanted,I needed a pair of decent headphones that didn't bother my ears. This is just what I got. No problems at all.
2,not great,"i bought these headphones especially for the purpose of running, but they're too big for my ears and keep falling out. plus, they're not great for casual music listening--they're too bulky and awkward to put on and take off. i am returning them to amazon."
5,classic,"this are my favorite headphones, and i have had a lot and still non better, these are in ear but not, so they are small yet comforatable"
2,"Low Sound Quality, even for something this cheap","The sound quality was much lower than I expected even from an inexpensive pair - there isn't much base and it sounds pretty hollow.To top it off, there is a consistent static in the background when these are plugged into my computer - there isn't any with other headphones.The cord is much shorter than I expected, on the order of half a similar pair of headphones I recently purchased.The only real pro I see is that they stay on well, but this can be found with other pairs. These seem to sell very well, which is why I bought them, but I fail to see why.My experience: You're better off paying an extra few bucks for a nicer model or just going with a cheaper model and expect poor sound quality."
2,Non Slip?,The chord is entirely too long for an active set of head phones. Who needs 4 foot total length. I'm not wearing my MP3 player on my ankle. This is especially true if you wear your media player around your neck. I don't know how active others have really been while wearing these but they did not stay in my ears. I have fairly large ears as well so I was really surprised by this one. I figured they would be bothering me by being too tight! Do not get these if you are planning on really running around. These might be ok if you are just walking or something.
3,Way too large,"I got these a couple of weeks ago based off of the reviews - I wanted something cheap, but with a decent quality and while I think these headphones provide both...they were far too big for my ears. I don't really think I have small ears by any means, but these fall off of me walking. I've tried adjusting them so they sit way back on my ears (like as far as they can go) and that seems to help SOME, but that messes with the comfort and the sound quality of them. I had my boyfriend try them on just to make sure I didn't have super small ears, and he had the same problem. Thankfully, they were under $10 so it's not a ton of money wasted, but for me, I am disappointed."
4,you get what you pay,"overall, it is a good product, i like it.i use it when im jogging, so you dont really care about the sound quality...but it is really comfortable.it just sometimes the volume is not balanced because this earphone is hanging on the ear."
4,Great for running!,"So, I still have these more than a year later and they are still working great! These have been great for outdoor running, running at the gym, or just doing anything that involves moving. I use 'em when I cut the grass, walk the dog, or take the bus. They don't slip out, they're fairly comfortable, and they look good. I was tired of my original iPod buds slipping out of my ears. If you're serious about listening to your playlist while jogging, this is it. For the price, it's fantastic! The sound quality has slightly dipped since I first bought them, but I'll probably just order another pair."
2,Bad sound quality,Bad sound quality. Not adjustable. Hearing static after bringing to the gym for 5 months. Not worth it.
3,Just ok,"I've purchased this headset to especially go to the gym. The problem with the size is it's too big around your ear so when running you need to adjust it from time to time, this affects the sound quality as you need to replace it of better fix it so you have a better sound.Overall if not running it's ok ."
3,Sony MDR-J10 Clip-on Style Stereo Headphones,Sound quality is good. not comfortable with the design - when plugged the headphones are facing ahead but not to the ears so I could not hear the music very clearly.
1,Not good for running... period.,"I got this because of the reviews saying they would stay in place...well, i tried them for the first time 2 days ago and I spent most of the time putting them back in place than actually working out (just running and walking, nothing too crazy). They seem to be too big for me, not that my ears are tiny, but they definitely don't fit.Sound is just OK, you get what u paid for. I don't mind too much about the sound quality, but if it would only stay in place!!"
4,Great for Biking (with only one ear),"I like these headphones for listening to the radio on my morning bike commute. The reason I like them may be why others don't. They really do not have great sound isolation. If you turn them off, you can hear outside noises the same with them on or off.For biking, I cut off the left earphone and only use the right. I keep the volume low so I can still hear what's going on around me. When I am using my iPhone, I put it on mono audio. Otherwise, I just make due with one side.They stay on nicely even with hats, helmets, etc.The cord is about the right length. I am ordering a second backup pair so I am ready. I am sure all of my sweat will eventually degrade them."
1,Poor sound quality...,"Bought a pair of these earlier tonight in Best Buy for a few bucks more than listed here. Sadly, it still wasn't worth the price!First off, the fit is good. They stay on your ear really well. Having said that...The sound is AWFUL!!! Really awful! Do not buy these unless you want to waste money on shipping them back.For what you spent on an iPod or MP3 or whatever...spend a little more & get better."
2,One size does not fit all,"This Sony earphone is a nightmare to use. The earbuds are too big and the clips don't fit properly. Its a nusiance to get them on and they don't always stay on.<br /><br />The price was good, but if they don't fit, whats the point.<br /><br />Pass on these earphones!"
5,Head Set,"This is a replacement head set. We used the other pair so much that we wore them out, so we bought the same exact set to replace them. Love them. Good sound quality. Will keep replacing them with the same ones as long as they keep making them."
4,"Good headphones, but NOT designed for small ears.","The title pretty much says it all. I bought these headphones for jogging but upon trying them out it was immediately apparent that they were far too big and would have trouble staying on even if I was standing still, let alone doing something active like exercise. But then again, my ears ARE smaller than the norm so I'll just say that if your ears aren't average-sized to large, I wouldn't recommend this product. The sound quality is fine, though."
5,AWESOME,"I absolutely love these head phones, they work great with my iPOD. I bought these for when I work out they stay in nice and dont ever fall out."
2,Hurts my small ears,"I thought that these earphones would just sit outside your ear so that you can hear what is happening around you as well as your music. That is not true with this particular earphone, the speaker is perpendicular to the hook which goes around your ear, so the small part must be put in your ear canal to be comfortable. These earphones are great sounding, but beyond that I can not wear them for more than a half an hour at a time. The piece that must sit within your ear canal to get good sound is very large, and if you have small ears like I do it will stretch and pull your ear.I do like that you don't have to turn the volume up much to hear what you are listening to well. You can also turn the volume up very high and use them as speakers on your desk, but that does sort of defeat the purpose of earphones.Good for some people, but terrible for me."
4,Good Quality for Cheap Price,"I had originally planned on getting a behind-the-neck pair of headphones, but ended up going with these because I wear glasses. The ear clip on these don't interfere with my glasses at all. The clips are a bit large and can be a bit of a pain to wriggle onto my ear sometimes. All things said though, they are very comfy. The sound is pretty good too, even if they aren't the loudest and bass-heavy thing on the market. I got these with an employee discount at an electronics store -- do not pay more than 5 bucks for them, because they aren't really worth more."
3,"Ok, but could be better","These headphones aren't too bad. They're a little tricky to figure out how to get them to stay on your ear at first, but once you get it, they stay on pretty good. The sound quality isn't bad at all. I wouldn't recommend them for working out/running because, depending on the size of your ears, they might not stay on real well. They're pretty comfortable after a few minutes of wearing them. <br /><br />I'd recommend them if you aren't looking for something to listen to while not moving around a lot."
3,"Good, not great earphones.","These seem to do a pretty good job. I use them when I am running. My only gripe is that they sometimes work themselves out of my ear to where I need to press against them to fully seat them. They dont fall out of my ear, but come out just enough to where you cant hear the volume as good."
4,worth untangling,"this is my favorite for listening to podcasts and audio books while walking,working around the house and on the train to the airport. I especially like to listen in bed because they stay on while laying on my side and don't hurt. I hang them on the bedpost to keep them from tangling up. If you can get them with free shipping buy a dozen. once I loan one to somebody I don't get it back."
3,Great...for a few months...,"These headphones are a big improvement over annoying earbuds, especially if you enjoying listening to music while running. The sound quality is good, and they're comfortable and won't slip unless you have small ears. However, like several other customers have experienced, after a few months I suddenly had one ear stop working. The same thing has happened to my sister's set too. Being only $10-$15 at most stores, I ended up picking another pair up a few days ago, but I'm looking for a more reliable non-slip headphone model in the meantime."
2,Not so great,"These headphones are not so great. I've had them for quite some time, but I sill can't get used to the discomfort of having them in my ears. Sometimes it's fine, but other days I can't stand them. The Treble is nice, but the Bass is lacking. I've discarded them when they started crackling, and shocked me during usage. I assumed it was a fluke, but that has happened with a second pair I bought. I'd avoid this pair."
4,just a wee bit too big for my ears,"These are great. They go behind the ears well. I just wish the bud part that goes into the ear canal was a bit smaller. Since they don't fit perfectly, they rub and irritate the cartilage in my ear. I cannot wear them for more than an hour or so; they cause too much pain to last any longer. But, I will keep using them. Sony should make a model for female ears, just a little smaller."
2,Sneaky sneaky,"Just keep in mind this vendor has quite a racket going on. The headphones currently sell for $.99, but the shipping is about $7. Not as good a deal as you were hoping for."
2,Sound Good but kind of flimsy,"I bought these because the reviews were pretty good, and as far as sound goes I would agree that they are a very good value for the low price. But I bought these for the sole purpose of using them to workout and had issues on my first use with one of the earpieces cutting in and out. I had seen reports of a poor design around where the wire enters the earpiece and I am not sure that is exactly what I had, but it was frustrating. It only seemed to cut out as a result of my movement while doing cardio. Now I can only use them while not moving around. Given this problem, I would not buy them again. And I am still looking for the right pair of clip-on earphones that will not keep falling our of my ear and will not break my pocketbook."
4,"Tinny sound, but fine for my workout","As other reviewers have stated that the sound is tinny, and it's true. But earbuds hurt my ears and these hook over and don't have to be wedged into my ear and the tangle free cord is a nice feature. I would recommend."
5,Awesome,Great I like that they stay in place even when I'm laying down or running and exercising. Idea for gaming!
2,Cheap all around,"I bought these after struggling to keep ear buds in my ear while running. While these stay on my ear while running, the actually speaker part doesn't really stay in the ear canal. The result is a lot of ambient noise and no bass response."
2,"Worked great, then didn't.","Great fit, good sound, but after a few weeks one of the earbuds stopped working. Not sure why, might not be a common problem."
4,Durable and decent enough for running,"I bought these for my girlfriend because she goes running everyday and needed a new pair. They lasted for about 2.5 years while being used every day for about an hour long run. For that I'd say these are definitely worth it. I didn't give these five stars because of the sound quality. It's not like it is bad, but it just isn't five star worthy. But if you are only using these for running then I would for sure recommend them."
2,Didn't stay in my ear,"I think the title says it all. These would not stay on my ear and I wanted to use them for a 5k, but since they fell out while I ran, I don't think I'll keep them. Guess I'll keep looking."
3,Good earphones/,These are good headphones. The sound quality is good. they don't catch much sweat and they work when wet. The reason I give them only 3-stars is the reason I dislike all walkman style headphones/earbuds. The cords all break at the jack after about 6 months use--usually less. I can't understand why anyone would pay more for such a temporary product.
3,My Left Ear,I can't seem to get the left side to fit close enough to that ear for more clarity of sound.Stay tuned.
2,Ehh... not for small ears,"I purchased these to use while running. I guess my ears are too small, b/c they didn't fit snugly and I could hear a lot of outside noise. Plus when I move the cord around, I got some static... They are quite in-expensive, but that's about all that they have going for them."
4,Good Ear phones,"I bought these when I wanted something for running, yoga, gym, etc. as well as everyday use. I loved them, they didn't slip off, or around on my ear while i was moving, and the sound quality was decent especially for the price. I will agree with the others that the left ear bud stopped working eventually. For me it was two years. I had absolutely no problem with that since most headphones (apple generic, some expensive Sony phones, airport headphones all of varying styles) don't last three months in my house. Not only would I recommend this to someone else, but I'm getting ready to buy another pair."
3,"Okay but, could be WAY Better","They started out like a dream comfy very musically balanced great for Metal music especially for listening to screams and guttaral growls and splendid for pop which I occasionaly listen to. Then after a few months of vigorous use the plastic left earpiece started bending making it impossible to keep in my ear. And I wear glasses to explain to me how that's possible. Anyways for the first few months were great and I guess I got my moneys worth but, the old ones that came with my Sony cd player had rubber over the plastic and those lasted me for 3 years!!!If these had rubber or some kind of gel padding around the earpeices then these would be a 5/5 but as of now it's getting a still decent rating of 3/5.(I bought these on sale at Fry's for $5.00 during their After Xmas sale)"
1,SONY - BAD PURCHASE,"INITIALLY THEY PREFORM WELL, BUT AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS THEY LOSE ELASTICITY AND BECOME A IN THE BEHIND TO HOLD IN-PLACE. SONY HAS FINALLY MADE A PIECE OF JUNK."
4,Cheap and Worth it- until the left ear piece goes out...,"Yea- basically I just bought these just a few months ago- their nice and stuff- but of course like what other reviews on here have said- just watch and wait for it when that left ear piece starts to crackle and then all of a sudden stop working and then all you got is the right ear piece to listen to your music or whatever media your listening to.Otherwise, I like them because they work for me and of course their not even 10-20 $... They are comfortable to my ears compared to other earphones I've bought and work for the time being.Hope this helps..."
1,Crap,"I can't even walk around for awhile without them falling out of my ears. I bought these in hopes that I would be able to RUN without the headphones falling out, but I cannot even walk..."
4,"Not bad but fitting... Comfortable though, very","Good product. The fitting doesnt allow for great sound transferance to ear. They are so comfortable though and do not slip. Great for running and exercise and you can hear great, plus, I guess, the fact they are not super tight allows you to hear the environmental noise.I enjoy them and they work great for exercising."
1,horrible,these are by far the worst headphones i have ever bought. I did not know they could make headphones whith such horrible sound quality. They also feel like they are made of cheap plastic. Definently not worth the $15 i paided for them.
3,Okay but not very reliable,"I am on my second pair of these head phones and the same thing happened to this pair that happened to the last, only sooner: the right side stopped working. Apparently this is a common problem with these head phones. I might try one more pair, and maybe I'll get lucky. Too bad because the sound is decent for what you pay and they're fairly comfortable. My ears hurt a little after using them for several hours, but it's not serious. I really like the lightweight, clip-on design. I don't like ear buds or the over-the-head headphones, or the behind-the-neck ones either. This is an optimal design but the reliability is quite questionable."
4,Sony Headphones,The ear phones are a little too big thus they don't fit in my ears perfectly. That is the only drawback on this item.
4,MDR-J10,Good headphone as it fits in properly into the ears and it does not come out every now and then. Very Good sound quality.
2,"Stay on, but not in.","Pretty uncomfortable. They'll stay on your ear, for the most part, but not really in your ear, unless you jam them in, in which case, you might as well get buds. Not too good for jogging, especially if the cord gets too much slack. It'll bounce and can jar them off your ears. The plastic is hard. Something pliable would have been better. They seem made for someone with large ears."
3,Nice but...,"Everything excellent but the product package was opened when I received, It didn't seen used but I'd prefer a closed package"
2,"Poor bass, sound tinny","Compared to standard ipod earphones, the bass is noticably poor, and the earphones sound tinny. I'm going to try some iBud earjams instead. On the positive side, they fit my ears well."
2,Did not fit in my ears,The headphones did not fit in my ears. Therefore they were useless to me. I originally got them for running but they didn't even stay put when I was standing around. I guess my ears are too small to fit them. I didn't return them because it would've cost me $5 to return when i got them for $10 with free shipping. The sound quality is only ok when i tried it.
2,Disappointing,"I've been searching for earphones strictly for the purpose of running and the MDR-J10 is OK for comfort but isn't durable, I was only able to use it once before the left side started shorting out. You would expect more durability from equipment for this reason. So I guess my search continues."
2,"Cheap, fast shipping, low quality","This set of headphone is cheap. As a result doesn't have a good quality.The construction is not good, giving a feeling of some very cheap plastic.The sound quality is flat, not appealing for any kind of music.It is loose. I don't understand how such a designed for sport headphone cannot stay on my ears firmly; it cannot fit into ears well either, 1/3 of the ""head part"" is out of ear.However, for such a price, this headphone is ok. I just use it for working out at gym so I wouldn't tear up my good one.The shipping is really good! It's free shipping and arrived within 2 days. Amazing!"
1,Sound is miserable. Meant only for big ears,"Before these head phones, I purchased Senneheiser PMX 80. Those sound very good and comfortable while running. But they are not when working out. So I wanted to try these headphones because of cheap price. I was eager to try these head phones. But when I put these on my ears, they are very lose. I think these are good for only larger ears. Then I tried them with my IPOD. Sound quality is horrible. These is no bass. The default headphones that came with ipod sound better."
2,good....just not for running,These headphones don't have bad sound quality. They just don't stay in your ears while you exercise. especially running. less than a half mile into a run they start to come out.
