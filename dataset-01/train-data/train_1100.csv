4,Phantasy Star Fan!! From Georgia,"Man, talking about Anime music, this is the best album I ever heard. All the songs in this CD are great! Especially someone like me, who never even played Phantasy Star Online before. To all the Phantasy Star Fans, this CD will keep you dancing and playing the CD over and over again!! I recommmed this to anyone who loves space-orchestrated music like me."
4,Entertaining and biased,"Howard Engel's treatment of the history of executioners is both entertaining and biased (as he readily admits). The book begins well with many an ironic turn of phrase and gallows humor but by the end, Mr. Engel's political bias has taken over. He seems to have a particular obsession with Fred Leuchter. How anyone could link so-called holocaust denial into a book which purports to give an overview of executioners is beyond me. The first half of the book is an entertaining read; the second half a hackneyed polemic."
4,Light Jests and Heavy Sermons,"Wry! Using mock detachment, clinical detail, understatement and overstatement, Howard Engel presents a chronicle of capital punishment through the eyes, ears, minds and hearts of the world's tribe of hangmen, headsmen and their henchmen. With feigned scientific aloofness and a straight face, Engel allows the death penalty to speak for itself against itself. His masterful treatment of a sordid subject proves that a light jester teaches more than a heavy sermonizer."
5,Fantastic!,"I bought this merely for the 13th track (The Thunderpuss Version of the Temptation Island Theme) but was pleasantlty surprised to find that the entire was fabulous! (although track 13 was no doubt the best) If your a latin fan, this album is an absolute much have! or if your a Thunderpuss fan, this remix is no doubt one of their best!"
1,"Lots of pictures, no how-to","I was very disappointed with this book. Yes, the pictures are beautiful to look at, but the author does not show how to create the looks yourself. Instead, after every vague idea she lists, the book directs you to contact your wedding planner, florist, caterer, highly-paid local artist, etc. Personally, I prefer Martha Stewart because she gives directions and templates that allow you to create the beautiful things YOURSELF, without having to spend an exorbitant amount of money on a professional. I suggest you save your money on this book and just subscribe to Martha Stewart Weddings."
4,Classy,"Very classy & sophisticated decoration ideas for those who have money to spend; however, ideas can be adapted to your style and budget; sharp still photography; useful book that walks you through the finer points of planning a wedding - from the engagement all the way to the wedding favors."
1,Way too expensive,"Again, my grand daughter wanted everything by this author, I should have checked them out before paying so much money for such little to show for it. Although I didn't pay $25, I paid $11 for a paper back with 8 pages, 30 words, half was ""ha ha ha and Hee hee hee."
2,Dreadfully over-rated,"When you make claims like that you'd better be able to back them up. Ms. Green does not. I live in Portland, Oregon, a fairly cosmopolitan city but no New York, Paris or Singapore. We have little Russian specialty stores and big pan-Asian supermarkets such as Uwajimaya and Fubon. Off the top of my head I can name a couple dozen vegetables which are perennially on the shelves at these two places from shen choy and bitter melon to gingko seeds, padan and pea sprouts. These are all commonplace in East Asian cooking. None even gets a mention.It's good as far as it goes, so it doesn't get one star. It doesn't even come close to its brag, so it gets no more than two."
4,Indeed a field book,"This is a pocket book, it was smaller than I expected, but it is probably better that way. The color photographs are in the center pages with descriptions in the rest of the book, referencing the photos. It has useful information on most of the vegetables available in the market. It even has equivalent names in other languages for some of the entries. I did not find some exotic fruits and vegetables, but they are not common in the market."
2,too small,First the book is way too small it's hard to read it and I would have liked to have pictures to see the produce it was talking about
4,Great Reference,"A pocket-guide, small enough to fit into your purse, filled with fantastic information about fruits and vegetables.Aliza Green is a chef, teacher and food writer based in the Philadelphia area. This is her third book.The Field Guide to Produce is an excellent guide if you are looking to educate yourself on the produce available to you at your local market. There are photographs to help you identify the item at the store, as well as a description of each item, the season it is available, how to choose it at the store, what to avoid when selecting your produce, how to store it, serving suggestions, flavor infinities and other names the item may use!This is not a cookbook. There are no recipes inside. Yet, there are clear color photographs helping you to identify some of the more exotic items at your store, and even the most familiar.If you are new to cooking, or want to educate yourself further in newer more exotic items, then check out this book. It is extremely useful!"
5,Perfect for Novices Like Me,"My husband and I rarely stopped in the produce section of the grocery store. We never knew what to buy, and when we did buy something, it usually went bad before we figured out what to do with it. (We're not big on recipes; we just generally throw a few things together and call it a meal.)This book has been a *huge* help. We're so glad we found it.This book explains what produce is in season, how to pick it out, what to avoid, how to store it, and how to prepare it. Plus, it even gives suggestions on how each kind of produce could be used and lists ""flavor affinities"" to let you know what other flavors the produce is generally compatible with.Thanks to this book, the produce section is now a regular stop when we go shopping, and we're actually getting our recommended servings of fruits and vegetables. Huzzah."
3,Disappointed,"This book gives good, basic, brief information about a variety of fruits and vegetables. I feel it pales in comparison, however, to Elizabeth Schneider's books on produce because her books are more detailed. I would say that if you like brevity you will like this book by Aliza Green, were it not that I feel your hard-earned money is better spent on the more detailed Schneider books."
2,"Has its moments, but ...","So much of the advice in here is purely common sense ... and some of it is rather weird. Are there really readers out there who need to be told, when selecting fruits/veggies, to not buy things that are moldy or bruised or rotten? I was hoping for something a bit more profound.And I couldn't believe my eyes when I read that apples should be kept in the fridge, because they'll go 'mealy' within 48 hours on the counter! Am I the only person in America who keeps apples on the counter for weeks without difficulty? (Well, assuming they don't get eaten up first.)There is some interesting info on different varieties and cultivars, but even that is available elsewhere, and most of the content is a waste of time/money for anyone who already knows more than the basics."
2,Cheap Tarantino knock off,"Question: Why buy a cheap imitation when you can own the real thing for the same price? I'm talking about the DVDs of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" of course. Both brought to you by a director that understands pacing, acting and directing actors. I've seen a lot of ""Tarantinoesque"" films, but never one with such shameless disregard of originality. ""BGB&O"" does have flurries of good writing, but the director doesn't know when to have his characters shut up. Watching this, all I kept saying to myself was, ""Breath, man, breath..."" Technically, it wasn't half-bad, its low budget actually works in its favor, much like ""El Mariachi"" (we saw what happened when a large budget was thrown at that very same story with ""Desperado""). Like I said, your money would better spent purchasing films that this one tries so desperately to imitate."
4,Exciting movie,"Saw this in my video store and rented it for the title more than anything. I have to say, it was one of the better movies I rented in a long time. The acting was pretty decent, but the thing that got me was the ending. Killer music too."
5,Really great rental!,"Rented this film the other night and was duly impressed! This film looks like it was made for about 5 bucks, but it really packs a punch! Great dialogue and acting and the story knocked me out. I can't believe this film hasn't gotten more notice."
1,"the blood, the guts, the bullets and the octane fall dead","I was expecting bigger and better things from writer and director Joe Carnahan because he did infact write and direct NARC! Carnahan plays the mouthy, bad talking, macho Sid French and that other guy plays his partner. A lot of bad acting equals to miscasting. The black cop was annoying. The funniest guy was Vernon who was saying his guy friend had sexual relations with Johnny Cash. A tour-de-force of bad camera work mixed with bad editing and a wooden and stilled supporting cast. I think this tries to echoe into the realm of Quentin Tarantino but it never goes anywhere. A total waste of my time"
1,What are you people thinking?,"This was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It isn't ""clever"" dialogue that cracks me up but rather the horrendous film making. B,G,B,&O is the type of movie I would have written when I was fifteen and thought Quinten Tarantino was the greatest film maker of all time. The fact that this is the type of stuff fifteen year old boys would make isn't as bad as the fact that fifteen year old boys could probabally make a film of the same quality as B,G,B,&O. Even though this movie is, in my opinion, one of the worst movies ever made I still have to suggest that everyone see it. The piss poor quality of this movie will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. One scene I really loved was when this guy at a diner tells a story about Johnny Cash being violated in prison. The guy delivers the entire rant doing an impression of Jules from Pulp Fiction."
5,Some Movies are Worth Seeing More than Once,"While comparisons with movies directed by Tarantino are justified, I really felt that this flick stood on its own and was not excessively derivative.The filmmakers did an excellent job of creating two realistic leading characters and giving them a plausible world to inhabit. The movie is by no means short of action, but does not use fist fights and car chases as a end in and of themselves, but rather uses them to advance the plot.Roger Ebert roundly criticized the ending of this film, I believe using the expression, ""An exercise in desperation,"" but I felt that the ending was both entirely appropriate for the setup leading up to it and original.Blood Guts Bullets & Octane is an exciting movie that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys smart action movies."
5,Butter Baby!,"I see this movie listed as one of the best of indie-film for'99. I never heard of it, so I track it down, watch it and amsummarily blown away. Top-notch acting and directing (especially good is G-man Ken Rudulph and harried lemon-lot hustler Dan Leis as Bob) Strong recommendations from somebody who sees a lot of bad videos, this one is a rare bird, and great! END"
4,Understanding the other side of the story . . .,"I bought this for research and it is terrific. It really gets into the mindset and political background of the story of the White Rose and helps the reader to understand the 'why' of the story. Not as personal as other accounts, it nevertheless is a wonderful background that will help you see Nazi Germany in a whole new light while telling the moving and touching story of Sophie Scholl."
4,Voices Never Forgotten,"I am so glad that books like this exist to balance the belief that nobody stood up to express their unhappiness with what the Nazis were doing. It was dangerous, but it did take place. It is astounding that the literature still remains and is reproduced in this work. Ms Scholl faced death with incredible courage. As a child I read Anne Frank's diary and was very moved by it. I think that this would be a wonderful work to go with it; that she wasn't wrong in her belief and her hope of humanity."
5,Dropping into Nazi Germany,"An emotionally stirring true account of a beautiful young woman, Sophie Scholl, her brother and a small group of anti-Nazi Germans whose resistance (The White Rose) to the regime's atrocities serves as a timeless model for all concerned with evil. From the first page of the book you are transported onto the streets of Munich at the height of the Third Reich. Trying to figure out how to resist and weaken the Nazi regime is an extremely dangerous course of action for a university student with the Gestapo one step away.The book reads like a breath stopping fictional adventure novel until you remember all the characters were real and the story is real. After you read the last page, there is a guilt feeling that it is now the reader's job to keep Sophie alive."
5,Amazing - a must read!!!,"This book was definitely a must-read, not only for those that are interested in this time period of study, but for anyone who wants to have a better understanding of world history. It's amazing, simply put. It reads so quickly. You are definitely drawn in from the very first page to the last."
5,Damned In The 70's,"The very first Damned album. Actualy the first punk album as well (if you don't count The Stooges). Features the line up of Dave Vanian (vocals), Rat Scabies (drums), Captain Sensible (bass?), and Brian James (guitar?). If you only by one Damned CD make it this one. And if you want more get ""Music For Pleasure"" and ""Machine Gun Etiquette"". And if that's still not enough, just make sure what your buying features both Rat Scabies and Captain Sensible."
4,Four Stars for Spirit,"Besides ""New Rose"" and a few others, the songs on this album aren't very good. There's a lot of stupidity, juvenile sexism, and none of the unified vision that made albs by the Clash, Pistols, etc. classics. Also, persistent rumors suggest that the whole album was varispeeded--sped up in the mixing room. In the slapdash days of Punk, this kind of studio trickery was considered a dispicable cheat, and in fact one of the Clash's producers was fired for trying it on ""Clash City Rockers.""What puts this music over is spirit. Despite their lack of purpose or many interesting musical ideas, the band's enthusiasm and merry sincerity are infectuous. Unlike most of their colleagues they are totally unpretentious, devoid of vanity, and don't give a damn what anyone else thinks. As such they tap into the jolly, oblivious underdog in all of us. Listen to them when you need a charge but don't feel bitter or earnest enough for Rotten or Strummer."
5,"23 years of Anarchy, Chaos and Destruction","This was the album that did it for me. I was 17, got an earful and never payed attention to mainstream music again. The Sex's and the Clash were bigger, but the Damned were the dictionary definition of 70's Punk Rock."
5,The Best Punk Album Ever,"Yes, folks, you read right. I would say this tops the list, not just punk, but rock in general. ""New Rose"" itself is worth the price of the album."
4,"""Damn"" good!","The Damned were one of the first punk bands, but unlike The Pistols, (Never Mind The Bollocks came out same year as Damned Damned Damned) they didn't write about polotics, and the weren't really all that angry... They were like the Ramones, good old fashioned fun... My favorite track on here is Fan Club, but New Rose is also great! If you like old school punk, this is an essential!"
4,Boost the levels,"If you aren't afraid of your volume knob, this re-issue can sound pretty good. Great songs, brittle clanky sound."
5,Absolutely Classic,This is an essential album for anyone with good taste in music. One of the first punk albums I ever bought and still one of the best.
3,Adequate Spare Battery So Far,"I purchased this for a vacation, where I was not sure how often I would be charging my 680. This appears to be a correct replacement for the original Treo 680 battery, and has worked OK for the last two weeks. (I was actually able to charge it regularly, so I used it consistently and relegated the original to use as a spare.)Note that this is *not* a genuine Palm battery - at least not the unit I received.So, based on limited use, this is a recommended alternative to the original 680 battery."
1,Died after 5 months of use,"Battery worked fine for a while, but after 5 months of use, which is about 150 recharges, it dies after a few minutes of use. Lion batteries are supposed to be good for 400 recharges.Cheap in both price and quality"
3,Good service,The product was exactly as listed and was received very quickly. I would buy from this seller again.
4,Good price for a good battery,"This is a very inexpensive extra battery for the Treo. It performs about as well as the original equipment, and, of course, the reason you need it is that the battery life on at least the 680 is not stellar. It's a good piece of insurance to carry with you on a trip or anywhere you might not be able to plug in, and in an emergency the extra hours of phone life could be a life saver."
4,Great Vocals Great Song,Anastacia has a wonderful voice...it is beautiful and tough at the same time. This song is soo beautiful in its own right...can't wait to get the full album. You go girl.
4,A Star to look out for,"The first time i lay my eyes on this lady in Channel [v], i knew she is gonna be a MAJOR babe to look out for in these new mellienium. Her ever first single released ""i'm outta love"", would help to propel her into a higher stardom and give a fresh breath to the current mundane music scene filled wiht teeny-bopper. If your like the remixes churning out from the kind of Whitney or Madonna, u will never regret getting this one. Highly recommended ! Bravo to Anastacia..."
4,Outta this world!,"What a huge debut for a cool new diva! This midtempo pop song is fierce in its original version, but Hex Hector lifts it right up to club proportions and works the chorus hard. Anastacia's voice is so dark and brooding that this can pass for underground sound as well as commercial sound. Hex is just unstoppable these days. Enjoy."
4,She can outsing any diva out there.,"If you've read some other reviews, they don't know what they are talking about.This single is the bomb! Anastacia started out as a club kid in NYC. She then got on to Club MTV and some other MTV shows before she made it onto The Cut, an MTV StarSearch-type show. She made it all the way to the finals but didn't catch the crown. Unfortunately, or we would have had the delight of hearing her a while ago. Now, she's back on the scene. She's endorsed by Lisa ""Left-eye"" Lopez of TLC, Michael Jackson.Her voice is very similar to Talor Dayne's. She's a little stronger in the aspect though. She gives you Taylor, she gives you Tina Turner, she just GIVE'S you soul. I highly recommend this single, especially the radio edit. Funky, disco, the guitar is fun. She gives you her all and you'll enjoy it. I promise."
1,If you can't read music you might want to hold off...,"When I bought this book, I didn't know that I would have to be able to read music fluently in order to use it. I would NOT have bought it. I am working on reading music, but in the mean time, I still want to grow as a player from the books that I buy and read. I believe that the author should have included TAB. Not only would he have reached a larger audience, but it would help players to learn how to read notation! The book does include a CD and the tracks sound nice."
1,Worthless book,"This book seems to be aimed at a very low level , full of gimmicks,crossword puzzles and sound effects(flushing toilets,sneezing etc.)The musical theory jumps all over the place ... infact I really don't want to waste my time reviewing it!!!ITS POOR BE WARNED DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
2,Good Potential Ruined by Bad Print,"This film is a well meaning attempt to capture some of the richness of African Americans in the movies, but the good intentions are undercut by the poor quality of the clips selected. Too many excerpts are faded or chipped or nearly unwatchable. Why release such an important documentary with such poor supporting material? Much better is the film ""Small Steps, Big Strides,"" which does a superior job of highlighting the contributions of black performers in their historical evolution, and uses much better visuals."
2,Gets old quickly,"The first part of the trilogy was somewhat interesting. I liked some of the descriptions about Drow life and culture. It was a little hard, however, to accept the premise that a single Drow would somehow transcend all the conditionings of his culture and develop a ""normal"" (i.e. 21st century Human) morality. Even if you accept this for what it is, the story goes nowhere. Unless you are in high-school and play Dungeons and Dragons, you may want to pass on this one."
3,"Nothing great, but not bad","I finished reading the Dark Elf Trilogy by R. A. Salvatore. A coworker of mine gave it to me for my birthday because it's one of his favorite books. It's a Dungeons & Dragons based book (Forgotten Realms, actually). It was okay. It was a male-centric book, except that the women of Underdark were the rulers. I get that the author was going for Girl Power, but he kind of missed the mark by making them abusive misandronic tyrannts.I ended up skimming through some of the chapters."
4,One big book,"This series is very entertaining. Sometimes you can almost hear the dice rolling. Includes semi-subtle references to RPG concepts such as character alignment, but intentionally and well-handled. Be aware though, that this is a single large softcover book containing the text of all three books, not a boxes set containing three separately-bound books. The single book is a bit heavy at times. It measures about 9 inches tall, 6 inches wide, and 1 3/8 inches thick. This book is a prequel (meaning, a sequel that takes place chronologically before the events in the books which were written before it); excellent story of Drizzt's origins and how he came to the surface world."
5,Excellent night books!,"Perfect for reading in the night. Just some fine books about the drow elf that I have come to love. You just feel sympathy for Drizzt, don't you? So sad. Some excellent battle scenes, good plot for a great trilogy, and possibly the best ranger of all time:Montolio. God he's good. Salvatore is a great storyteller. Unfortuanly, most of the new Drizzt books are declining, but this one is my favorite. Guenhvyar's first appearence too."
5,Add Salvatore to the list of fantasy literature greats,"The Dark Elf Trilogy is simply a stunning piece of fantasy literature. Salvatore not only gives us a touching prequil to his acclaimed Icewind Dale Trilogy, but developes an entire Underdark society in the process. As we travel through the life of the enigmatic dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden, we experience the enitre feel of Drow society through Salvatore's masterful discription.Drizzt has become one of the fantasy world's most beloved charecters, and it is not hard to see why. The internal struggle Drizzt faces between his personal morals and society's norms becomes a lesson of life for all readers.The trilogy not only is a great entertaining epic tale, it is also an invaluble asset to Dungeon Masters who are looking to learn more about Drow society. Salvatore creates an entire dark world which he thouroghly and entertainingly emerses the reader in. The perfect read for the DM wanting to involve Drow or the Underdark in general to their campaign."
5,The tale of an ethical drow,"While getting all three books at once is a bit of a commitment, especially for those unfamiliar with Drizzt Do'Urden and the Forgotten Realms universe, I can assure those who may have some doubts about purchasing this trilogy to have no fear. It's awesome. I'd read Salvatore's work before, but never anything based in the FR world. To boot, I'm not usually one who enjoys fantasy, as most of it seems to be formulaic and repetitive. This trilogy, however, contains all that is good in well written fantasy, including characterization, and Salvatore does an outstanding job with fleshing out the character of Drizzt Do'Urden, a dark elf who is one of the major players in FR. Many I've heard from have said to start with the IceWind Dale trilogy, and I won't dispute that, but this trilogy can also be considered a good place to start. I came away really impressed and am ready to continue the journey. 5 stars!"
4,Very good fantasy!,"I found these books to be very addictive. If you like fantasy, it is highly probable that you will like this series. My curiosity keeps me wanting more after each chapter. Although, this feeling does seem to diminish somewhat toward the end.I haven't read any of his other work before this, but there does seem to be some predictability in the plot of this series. In addition, even though it was easy to read, the way it was written doesn't exactly satisfy me. There are also printing errors on a few pages in one of the books, which was frustrating when trying to read the last of the words on the right side of each page (The text was printed too far to the right).All in all, the story and action really make up for the shortcomings of this series.Great value!"
3,"Some good moments, but not great","This was my first D&D novel to read, which I read at a friend's recommendation. I came to the book expecting it to be mostly hack-and-slash, action and excitement. I was pleased to discover that Salvatore weaves some meaningful moral themes throughout the book. In this vein, the novel was deeper than I expected. Also, this book has good characters, original ideas and a well-paced plot. However, the simplistic style and clumsy syntax keep this from being a great book. There are literally hundreds of one-sentence paragraphs and the dialogue is often stilted and awkward. I recommend it as an entertaining read with some layers of meaning but can't call it anything more."
5,In the world of the drow,"Drow, a sadistic and cruel race who epitomize the concept of intrigue and stealth. The world of the Drow as Bob so deftly explained it was everything i imagined and more. The warring houses, the struggle for power and superiority was a creation of no small means. In the middle of it all was a lone drow who questioned the meaning of his existence and the cruel nature of his race.Drizzt became a character I loved, not only because he was the most adept and competent of all the drow in Menzoberranzan but bacause he stuck to his morals and beliefs in a world where the natural order was malicious. Drizzt's struggles through the underdark, his self imposed exile from his kin, and later his journeys on the surface outline the very meaning of life and friendship. His feelings cast down bigotry and racism and show the meaning of truly embracing a person for who they are. A MUST READ!!!"
5,Excellent,"R.A. Salvator is probably one of the best writers in modern Fantasy. His ability to keep you turning pages until the wee hours of the morning is amazing. He is one of my favorite authors, and I cannot wait to read the next book in the series!"
1,Junk,"Poorly written, re-hashed ""high"" fantasy garbage. There are no themes here that haven't been explored better by other authors. Throwing mounds of banal prose at a subject won't improve the subject. If you like reading junk, this is for you."
5,The Greatest story so far,"In the beginning I was a little sceptic, because the drow race didn't apply to me, but already after a couple of chapters, I was entangled in the glorious novel about Drizzt Do'Urden, described by R.A. Salvatore. This is the greatest novel I have read so far, and I'm looking forward to be reading the Icewind Dale Trilogy."
5,The BEST fantasy novels i have ever read,"My brother gave me this book about a year ago, telling me that this was the best fantasy book that he had EVER read. He is a really big fan of Tolkien, and myself not being that interested in tolkien, i was somewhat skeptical. I decided to give it a try, and after the first chapter, I was hooked. Salvatore is now my favorite author, and i have been scraping together money to buy all of his Drizzt books... I'm almost there."
5,Dark elf trilogy,"This was the first set of Drizzt books I read, and they are the best. THe way Salvatore explains the drow city is awesome. You couldn't find a better book. I've read this set three times, and buying them all at once is defintly worth it. You save alot of money AND get to read the best Drizzt book on planet Earth.Well anyway, about the books themselves. They're are about a drow (an evil elf) named drizzt do'urdon who doesn't fit in with the rest of the drow. THey talk about rascism, not fitting in, and all thosse other bad things. It lets you understand how people who don't fit in feel. Plus drizzts swords are awesome.BUY THIS BOOK SET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Can't take this too seriously...,"This was my first exploration into the whole Forgotten Realms deal. It's very much ""low fantasy,"" violent and brutal without many characters to simpathize with. The writing is not good at all, but the story is still interesting, and you still feel for the characters. This is not an equal of the Lord of the Rings at all; imagine Tolkien crossed with a comic book, and this is what you get. The fight scenes do more to conjure up images of playing a role playing game than they do actual fighting; there is not the sense of realism here that there is in other fantasy."
5,I loved this trilogy,"I never used to be a big reader, but thanks to a friend introducing me to Homeland I've been reading a lot. The Dark Elf Trilogy started me on Salvatore's books. I can't put them down once I start. For anybody like me who wants to read but can't get into books easily Salvatore is the way to start. Read Homeland. You could get hooked like I did."
4,Not what I was hoping for,"Almost having exhausted the Dragonlance line & not caring much for Terry Brooks or George R.R. Martin(and plain despising Goodkind)I looked in an obvious place for more fantasy: WOTC's Forgotten Realms.Having heard Salvatore's the cream of the crop, I started with this trilogy. Don't get me wrong: Drizzt & all the other characters are intriguing enough and, having read so many DL books, the writing style is familiar.And therein lies my slight disappointment. The best Realms writer is no better(or, in most cases, no worse)than the average DL writer. I was hoping he would be the W&H of the Realms. Those facts won't deter me from reading more of these books but it is as I expected: The Realms isn't as magical a place as Krynn."
2,excellent then dismaying !!!,"Volume 1 is a delight, everything you wanna know about the drow society, can be used to describe any other dark, underground, highly sophisticated/perverted society.Volumes 2 and 3 are so poor seems like somebody else wrote them, or else the author lost inspiration, or else he needed money fast. Typically D&D; when not handled by an inspired master: no atmosphere, one can hear the dice rolling and the typical HP an XP counting... Characters are so caricatural and one dimensional, likewise with the scenery, as if the author got lost when outside of dungeons. Again typically D&D;: roborative, accounting-like. I read till the end out of respect for the writer, not sure he had respect for his readers when he wrote the last two volumes..."
2,it should have stayed in the dark where it belongs,"The most boring fantasy book I met during the last 5-6 years. The jacket and some descriptions promised much so I bought it. Managed to drag myself through about 150 pages but finally had to stop as I realized that I literally had to force myself to read some more of that ""masterpiece"".Action is scarce. Writing is primitive and descriptive. I love the authors who create new and fascinating worlds but a good idea did not work this time. Instead of showing the life, the world, the universe, the author just keeps telling you what you should see and what you should think on seeing it.2 stars because the original idea is not bad, otherwise I would have given it just one."
1,Salvatore panders out some more garbage,"OH look more books about a god like characters from Salvatore (another cadderly from ""the clerical quintet."") A good drow who can take on a whole army and not die, and then his rival who also could take on a whole army and not die and look we got lots of pages about nothing. Because the antagonist can't kill the main character and the main character can't kill the antagonist. What's the point in reading a book when you know the out come, Drizzt wins. If Salvatore can ever evolve out of his ""god characters"" style of writing he actually might become a worthwhile author."
3,"Very entertaining, light reading.","Salvatore makes no pretenses at this book being deep or thoughtful, but it's fun and fast-paced and has charming characters. There's hardly a boring place (except maybe the very beginning) and I did really care for Drizzt and Zak and the rest of them. If you don't mind some incredibly stereotypical elements and magic fountaining from all directions, then you should definitely enjoy this one. It's fun. :)"
3,Not bad but not great either,"This is an OK book. When reading R.A. Salvatore, you do not expect great literature but an entertaining reading with nice flowing action. I found that the first of the three books in the collection fit the bill but the other two were not as good. They did not flow well and some of the adventures described did not seem to have a point. Overall it was OK but not as good as some other books in the series."
3,"Stories are great, just hard to read","A friend recommended the Dark Elf trilogy, and I am truly enjoying the stories. However, it should be noted that this particular box set was printed with a VERY small (perhaps 8 point) type size which makes the paperbacks difficult to read comfortably. If you have difficulty reading a small type size, you might want to look at a different edition of the three books. It would be worth the difference in cost to simply avoid the headaches!"
4,Great preread,"If you have read the Icewind Dale Trilogy or have any plans to do so this book is most definetly worth a read.Explains the life of Drizzt and the land that he has come from, in great detail and will add a much greater level of enjoyment to the following books in the Drizzt series."
4,fantasy lovers won't be dissapointed,"Salvatore gets down to business quick. He won't bore you endless description or chatty, unnecessary dialogue. Drizzt is a well thought out, complex character to whom you can sympathize with (if you can't connect with a character at some level then the story is lost). Fans of Dungeons and Dragons or Weiss and Hickmans Dragonlance series will find this trilogy captivating."
5,Very Cute,"I thought this was an adorable book. It has a lot of cute suggestions and advice, and it is written in a very easy to read format where the chapters are sub-divided up and use a lot of bullets so that it is quicker and easier to pick up for a quick glance than something with long paragraphs and drawn out stories. I plan to highlight the more useful parts then send it to my sweetheart as a surprise gift (one of the book's suggestions)."
3,"Fun, but not really impressed","There are some good ideas and some fun things in this book, but overall I found that half of the book was really a waste of space (a list of LDRs in history? It could have been interesting but this author doesn't make it so). It seems to me that the author tries too hard to be funny and it becomes distracting. There are some good topics covered, but overall I'm not very impressed. It's not a BAD little book, but it's too pop-culturey to be taken seriously."
3,"A light read, not a serious book on the topic","This is really light, fluffy reading. It's also a rather small book, in terms of actual book size. It's humorous and pretty cute, and it might make a good read for an airplane trip to see your sweetheart, but it's rather low on the solid, practical advice. It's the kind of book you might give as a stocking stuffer to a friend in an LDR, but it doesn't have a lot to offer if you're looking for real relationship help. There are better LDR books available."
3,A good starter LDR book,It's funny and practical. Some of the stuff is kinda common sense but it some really nice ideas and topics.
2,cmurder bites tupac,"most of you dont even know tha the song on this album called on my enimies, is a remake of tupacs song,''when we ride on our enimies''.the choursis the same cmurder flips the kyrics around a little.now how can he have that sng plus songs with the dogg pound?this cd is garbage"
1,review of this garbage cd,I THINK THIS CD IS GARBAGE. THERE ARE PROBABLY 4 GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD. HERES SOME ADVICE IF YOURE LOOKING FOR A GOOD NO LIMIT CD : TRY BIG ED OR MASTER P'S GHETTO D CD.
3,its all right,"life or death was it, you should have stuck with that style, bossalinie had too many slow tracks you know what i'm sayin, work on your next one"
2,THIS CD MAKES A TABLE PROP,"THIS IS TOTAL B.S.!!! I BOUGHT THIS CD THINKING, WELL NO LIMIT HAS SOLD OUT IN THE LAST 8 OR 9 ALBUMS, BUT I SAID C-MURDER AINT GONNA SELL OUT THOUGH. MAN THIS IS A WASTE OF HOWEVER MUCH YOU PAY FOR IT IF YOU GOT LIFE OR DEATH DONT BUY THIS CRAP. THE INTRO AND OUTROS ON LIFE OR DEATH IS BETTER THAN EVERY TRACK ON THIS CD COMBINED. IF YOU LIKE NO LIMITS OLD STYLE DONT EVER I REPEAT DONT BUY THIS MESS!!!!"
2,WHAT THE HELL?,"MAN,NO DISRESPECT TO C,HE IS MY FAVORITE OUT OF THE NO LIMIT SOLDIERS,BUT IN 99' NO LIMIT AINT DOIN NOTHIN BUT PULLIN GARBAGE OUT OF THEIR ASS.LIFE OR DEATH KICKS THE MESS OUT OF THIS CD.THERE IS A FEW GOOD JAMS ON HERE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE AINT NOTING. IT AINT WORTH THE MONEY, GET LIFE OR DEATH IF YOU WANT THE REAL C-MURDER."
2,No Limit has lost it.,"What is wrong with people thinking that every No Limit CD is tight. Just like the rest of them its way too long and beats are all the same nothing new its just listening to Life or Death all over again. Save your money and buy krazie Bone or Nas, C-Murder and No Limit has lost its touch."
4,Straight Butta,"Ghetto Cowboy is the rawest song on that cut ,so get out and spend those 15 bones to get one of the best No Limit LP's yet!"
2,ANOTHER RECENT DISAPIONTING CD DROPPED TO FAST,"THIS CD WAS DISAPIONTING CD DROPPED TO FAST. HIS LAST ONE WAS JUST DROPPED LAST MARCH. TRACKS 2, 15, 23,24,26,27 ARE THE ONLY TRACKS WORTH LISTENING TO. U CAN SKIP THIS ONE. SONE WORDS FOR NO LIMIT SLOW DOWN. YOU ARE DROPPING TO FAST."
4,Not as good as Life or Death,"This CD is tight, but, it's not as good as Life or Death. my favorite songs on here are ""Ghetto Boy"" and ""Ghetto Millionaire"". Go buy this CD!!"
3,c-murder doesn't fall victim to sophmore curse,"released on no limit records in 1999, bossaline was a good effort put out by c-murder. he sounds similar to master p, but has a deeper gruffer voice (and doesn't drawl out ""uhhhhh"" every 2 seconds). with the killer tracks ""gangsta walk"" ""ride on dem bustas"" and ""money talks"", c shows us that he is versatile and can spit rhymes at all different tempos. most of the KLC beats are tremendous on here and keep you bouncin and the rest are just filler, typical no limit style that we should all expect by now. i like how you can really feel him with the more emotional songs like ""streets keep callin me"" and ""like a jungle"". he delves deep into these songs which is real cool. there are a few songs that you can skip past but don't push fast forward too long. 2nd to silkk the shocker, c-murder appears to be the best rapper on no limit with his sophmore release ""bossaline"". i pray he gets out of jail soon. no limit needs him."
2,i sAY sAVE yA cASh!,"yALL c-muRdEr oNlY mAkeZ tyTe gueST aPPerAncEz, thIS aLbUM oNlY toSSeZ oN lYKe sa fEW gOOd sONgz & a fEW ""oK"" soNgz, i say saVe yA cASh, mAn, dUN byE thIS, iF yA gEt c-muRdEr, beST 2 gEt yA haNdz oN dA 'liFe oR deAth' iNsteAD!"
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"There were only a handful of good songs on this album and I hardly ever listen to it anymore. Don't get me wrong, cause I ain't no tank h8r, I buy just about every album no limit puts out, but there's just no denyin, this album is wack. I have heard some good things about LIFE OR DEATH and I plan to get that cd in a few days. Keep it real C, and stay tru."
2,Bossalingerin' In The Wind,C-Murder is an artist expected to bring out straight A-1 material. He probably rushed on this album and didn't spend any time to make it treal and worthy to say No Limit Records. His 3rd time solo album Trapped in Crime should and better outdo this or he might as well do cameos.
3,"""Like a Jungle"" is da bomb:so is da cd","first off, i'd like to say that this cd is tighter then a motha f*cka.and i'd like to say f*ck all y'all that talkin sh*t bout this cd.like a jungle is my favorite song.i would recommend buyin this cd.it's tight."
1,no limit has reached there limit!,I give C-murder 1 star and that's only for the effort.(...)C-murder is nothing but a wack mc. He steals all tupac's style. He even tries to sound like him but sounds like an idiot. (...) There's not much to talk about on this album accept for the fact C-murder wishes he had tupac's talent. (...)
3,life or death was better,"It was pretty good, except for the lack of longer songs. The good ones were ghetto boy, ghetto millionaire, living legend, still making moves. It was worth the price though. NO LIMIT."
4,They call me C-Murder I'm a member of this TRU click...,C-murder is tight. I thought that his last album was better than this one but this one hits too. His songs are kind of short and leave you wanting more but it's still on point.
2,MORE SUB-PAR BEATS AND LYRICS,"Bossaline is the second album for C-Murder and I would consider it his worst. The musical backdrop [courtesy of Beats By The Pound] is less than average. Even though songs like ""Like A Jungle"" and ""Ride On Dem Bustas"" do display potential for good beats. They are still the same low standard for No Limit. And can't compete with Mannie Fresh [Cash Money Millionaires]. As for the lyrics Murder still relys on the traditional No Limit cliches. And he doesn't show much maturity. Only pick this up if you're a die hard No Limit fan."
1,lameeeeeeee...,"Well, if u really like Gangsta rap, C-Murder and No Limit is just a bunch of rip-offs. For example, On My Enemies on this album is a total rip off Tupac's ""When we ride on our enemies"" with the exact same damn lyrics. Come on... let's be real, this C-murder is quite a poseur.. haha.. He should at least write his own rap right?! Otherwise, how is he different from pop singers like Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson?"
5,ONE OF THE BEST CDS OF 99 SO FAR...GET IT ABD DONT SLEEP ON,"IT. I AM A NO LIMIT FAN AND I LOVE THEM .... ALL OF THEM. BUT THIS CD IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL. C-MURDER STAYS WITH THE TRADITIONAL NO LIMIT UNIQUE SOUND ON ONLY PART OF THE ALBUM, BUT FOR THE REST HE IS BEING THE INNOVATOR HE IS AND TRYING NEW STUFF. HE HAS A FEW NEW PRODUCERS ON THIS ALBUM THAT ARE THROWIN SOME BLAZIN TRACKS. C-'S LYRICS ARE OFF THE HOOK.ALOT OF PEOPLE THINK NO LIMIT IS A JOKE , BUT THAT IS WHY THEY RICH AND ALLL YOU PLAYER HATERS ARE BROKE.... THIS ALBUM IS PHAT AND ANY BODY WHO LIKES GOOD BANGIN STUFF GOTTA CHAECK IT OUT....HE EVEN GOT A SONG WITH KURUPT AND NATE , AND ANOTHER WITH DAZ.....I LOVE ,AND YOU ALL NEED TO GET IT. IT IS ONE OF THE HARDEST ALBUMS THIS YEAR......"
2,its aiight,"I give this cd 5 stars compared 2 what no limit is coming out with nowadays. I mean made man wuz disgusting, only god can judge me wuz sum r&b cd, not gangsta music that it used to be. C-Murder has a musical talent and he knows whos hot and whos not. he fetures kurupt,daz,nate who are the godfathers of rap.Snoop,soulja slim and magic which are the best people on no limit. Life or Death was a little bit better though, peace"
3,C needs to get back to that gangsta sh@@,"This album is an alright album,it had alot of soft songs and singing in it. I am use to that hardcore non stop gangsta rap from c-murder. ""like a jungle"", ""ghetto boy"", ""ride on dem bustas"" and ghetto millionaire"" were tight. Life or death was his best album yet. Im lookin for the best in his next solo release"
1,garbage batteries,"These batteries lasted about half as long as the replacements I've purchased at brick and mortar stores. Two were purchased and one is already shot, the other is close behind. We used to get about 7 to 10 days on a charge from the other battery suppliers batteries and these gave us 5 days when purchased and now are at about a day berfore needing a recharge. Look elswhere for replacement batteries and do me a favour and let me know who supplies the best on line batteries."
3,"Disappointing, rather derivative","Has rap, reggae, hip hop and electro-synth influences but the effect doesn't quite gel or compell."
4,Superstylin' Supergroove,"Since their inception into the underground club/electronic scene, GA has been hailed as one of the brightest in the industry, drawing praise from and collaboration with people like Madonna and Elton John.With the follow-up to their smash debut Vertigo which established them on the electronic map, they had a lot to follow. And....Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub) does live up to expectations.A fair mix of rap-funk music and ambient chill-out tracks, expect nothing too similar from Vertigo. The excellent first single showcases GA's deep inclinations with the use of beats and rap-funk-hiphop in their music. There are a few tracks in the same vein (Raising The Stakes, Tuning In). There's also the use of guitars in chill-out tracks like the gorgeous My Friend and Little By Little.Excellent sophormore."
4,Fun Listening,"I ordered this cd just because I wanted ""Superstylin'"" but I found out that most of this cd is pretty cool. Fun to listen to and it is worth ordering just because of SuperStylin'. Even if you don't much like 'techno' music you will enjoy SuperStylin'."
3,ehhhhh...,"i've really enjoyed the groove armada cd's vertigo and northern star, and even their back to mine compilation, so i was very excited when i saw this album to be coming out. i'm a little dissapointed in it, in my eyes a lot of it is very borderline cheesy. there are some great tracks on it as expected, but the consistency isn't there for me. keep in mind though my musical background may differ from yours (my various musical tastes have sprouted from phish/jam band type stuff), but i really do not recommend this album. it's definately not their best, so if you're a newbie to groove armada, buy vertigo. but that's just my opinion."
2,I agree with: underachieving,"this cd was keenly anticipated by myself, and i was disappointed when i heard it. it certainly is not a bad cd, but so much less than vertigo, and even less than what i expected being a fan of vertigo. if nothing else they do not do their name ""Groove' justice in this unoriginal, and slow album. 2 stars may be harsh, but hey it's a harch world"
4,GA go for downtempo mood,"Not what I expected especially since the album's title hints toward dance. The title should have been (Hello Lounge).GA has moved from its Jazz groove roots to more straight time downtempo music circa Kruder/Dorfmeister. It is a good album but a different direction from the sounds on ""Vertigo"". It will be a hard one to pull off live unless of course I'm sipping a martini on a velvet couch!"
4,"Not many highlights, but still a nice album to groove to (har har)","Groove Armada isn't a great group, but they do manage to deliver some quality tunes every now and then. I don't think ""Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)""'s best tunes are as good as ""Vertigo""'s, but they're still really good (and it's nice to hear a cameo appearance by Jeru The Damaja in ""Suntoucher"". Also, ""Suntoucher"" and ""My Friend"", especially, sound like they could be hits). However, some of the songs do sound a bit cheesy, and overall the album is pretty uneven. If you're a fan of Groove Armada or if you're looking for some groovy tunes, though, you should be at least satisfied with ""Goodbye Country (Hello Nightclub)"" (get ""Vertigo"" too!). Slightly recommended.Highlights include:""Suntoucher""""Superstylin'""""Little By Little""""My Friend""""Lazy Moon""""Edge Hill""""Tuning In (Dub Mix)"" (Though this one more as background music)"
5,Hello Groove Armada,"About once a month I try to purchase music that is new to me, often taking my cue from recommendations from Amazon. This was one of those purchases. This CD flat out rocks! It kicks off with ""Suntoucher"" and ""Superstylin'"" which takes you straight ot the dance floor, and then pauses to reflect with ""Little by Little"" and some great vocals from Ritchie Havens. Amazon recommended this after I purchased Fat Boy Slim. I'll definitely check out more Groove Armada after this."
1,Brother Louie '98 Version Suck Big Time!,"I don't like the rap version. The rapping doesn't make it any sense; the rapper tried too hard to rhyme everything, and it sounds STUPID!!! The rap lyrics are so dumb!If you ask me, the original extended version sounded better; it's too bad they didn't make a cut of it for this CD.Overall, this CD remixes suck big time. A heed of warning: Don't buy it! You will be very disappointed."
4,deep,"This was the recording that introduced me to Thin White Rope and, after buying two of their earlier efforts (""In the Spanish Cave"" and ""Sack Full of Silver""), it remains my favorite. This underrated band possessed a unique sound amid the late 80's and early 90's clutter of indie and lo-fi rock n' roll - a sound that I believe is crystallized on this album. It is easy and true enough to label ""The Ruby Sea"" a rock album. It is, however, a rock n' roll haunted by the ghost of a distant punk influence, shaped by a poetic vision of the human condition and unafraid to blur genres. There are moments of somber, almost gothic, introspection (""Puppet Dog"" and ""The Fish Song"" for instance) and times when a twisted country influence seems to shine through (""Bartender's Rag"", ""Christmas Skies""). Each track, different as one may seem from another, fits perfectly into the whole that is ""The Ruby Sea"", resulting in a disc that demands to be played and played again."
4,Excellent Modern Blues,"This is my second Ronnie Lovejoy CD and I was not disappointed in the least. Lovejoy's voice gives you the feeling that he has been through some blues and has a way of making you feel and get into his music. Also, his upbeat tunes makes you move and his slow jams makes you remember. I plan on adding all of Lovejoy's releases to my Blues library."
4,Love and Joy in one word Lovejoy,"I am amazed at the people who have not heard of Ronnie Lovejoy, but have now because I purchased his cd I play it in the house and car and I love the song ""Give my life"", Now I know why I liked it so well, it was a personal conversation with him and God. All of Lovejoy's music that I can find is in my Blues library."
1,would be nice to get the movie ordered,"I got the movie...very excited...then I put it in the DVD player and it was Jack Benny, I contacted Amazon...they didn't seem concerned, told me to buy and pay for a new one!!! and then send it back at my expense and they would then probably refund me! I wrote back and said I was concerned that the other ones would also be Jack Benny and have they checked the dvd's?? They have NEVER replied. I order a lot from Amazon and am sorely disappointed in their lack of customer service/interest..."
3,"early effort by the SPmex it's so, so","Hey i own it cuz I like SPM, but it's not one of his best, I like a couple tracks, I think Never Change is a better album by far although some peole here seem to dislike Never change."
5,South Bound As A Clown!,"Commin up Commin Down that G in H-Town, Southbound as a clown, come around, blaze a pound! SPMex is back with Hillwood which features his homies Shadow Remeirez, Grimm, Low-G, Rasheed, Baby Beesh, Lil' 1/2 Dead, ALT & the Hillwood Hustlaz. Coy's Hillwood album sounds like something like of a later day album of The Geto Boys. Carlos has sure put the south eastern Houston ghettos on the map. Commin up Commin Down is SPM's best reefer smoke out tune with an earie G-Funk to it, the song Hillwood is about ghetto barrios in Houston, TX like SE Reveille Park, H-Town G-Funk is just another one of Coy's songs to cheech out to & Deep Instrumental doesn't have much MCing to it, but has some creepy ass beats!Hillwoods best are *1, 2, *3, *4, 6, 7, 8 & *11."
3,"Good, but not great","De Camp tries to be Howard, but alas, falls flat in my opinion. The story could've had more of what makes Conan tales great; action, magic and gals."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC!!!!!,Teddy Pendergrass is a great artist! 1st of all the sound quality if this disc is very poor.Sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom with the vent on. 2nd none of the mixes are original and added anything new to any of the great tracks selected to be mixed. Again stay way!! The only pro is that the company who sold it was reliable and quick to deliver....Did I mention STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC...ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A TEDDY FAN!
5,BIOHAZARD ALL-STAR ABLUM,"IT'S LIKE A HARDCORE ALL-STAR GAME WITH GUESTS ALL OVER THIS CD.YOU HAVE MEMBERS OF SLIPKNOT,ANDREAS KISSER,DERRICK GREEN,AND IGOR CAVALERA FROM SEPULUTRA,PHIL FROM PANTERA,ROGER MIRET,SEN DOG,JAMIE JASTA,PETE STEELE,DANNY DIABLO AND PUERTO RICAN MIKE FROM SKARHEAD.IT'S COOL THAT BIO BROUGHT THIS GUYS IN ON THE CD AND SINCE I'M A FAN OF ALL THESE BANDS IT MAKES THIS ABLUM REALLY FUN TO LISTEN TO I BOUGHT THE EDITION WITH THE THREE BONUS TRACKS A.T.F.,LIFE OF MY OWN (THIS SONG FU**ING ROCKS)AND A COVER OF SEX AND VIOLENCE.THIS IS JUST A REALLY FUN CD AND IF YOU LIKE BIO AND ANY OF THE OTHER BANDS THAT THE GUEST ARE IN YOUR LOVE THIS CD.DOMINATION!!! DFL"
4,"Not their best, but awesome!",I'm a big fan of hardcore music and I've been listening to Biohazard for quite some time. I don't think this is their best CD but it's far from bad. I don't like some of the rapping going in it but aside from that it's a fast paced wonderful hardcore album.
2,NO NO NO,Not as bad as New World Disorder but still very poor. 8 years ago bands wanted to sound like biohazard. Now biohazard want to sound like today's popular bands. Buy everything from biohazard:biohazard to biohazard:mata leao. Don't buy the rest. oh and see them at a concert. They're still an awesome live band.
2,Second Rate Punkers,"The only great songs here are 'Life Of Crime"" (I've covered this one in a couple bands)and 'We Got The Neutron Bomb'. The rest ain't much; and the two stellar tunes I've mentioned are available on Rhino's D.I.Y compilation ""We're Desparate"", featuring all the late 70's LA groups, a much better value. At least they included a lyric sheet with this."
5,A Musical Tranquilizer,"This is a terrific collection of many of Mozart's best known and most beloved pieces. You will probably recognize many of the melodies - and with this CD, of course, you'll learn their names. This CD is really aptly named - it is a very 'relaxing' collection of beautiful music. One reviewer said that its great for the car - but also after that long, grinding day at work - you know, the kind of day where you feel especially eaten-up. You just want to go home and sit in your favorite chair and put on some music... It is also an excellent album to get the kids started on lovely classical music. Highly recommended!"
2,Poor recording quality,"I was very disappointed with the production of this cd. The sound quality was terrible. Maybe it the one I received was faulty and the sound quality is not typical of the product, but I ended up returning the cd."
4,What an enjoyable quirky movie.,Everyone should check out this movie. It is a quirky adventure... a tale of trying to cross the Mexican border into the USA. The entire cast of characters is so much fun to watch. Well done!!! You will definitely be entertained!So get out the popcorn and check this flick out!
2,A Stalker in Search of a Story,"This is a murky mishmash of a picture that seems to consist of undigested lumps of fright. It needed more bridges to connect the story line. Also, the ending comes out of thin air, whereas the path to that reveal could have been cleverly paved with clues.The DVD doesn't have any overall Director's commentary, but it does include a commentary option with the out-takes. The commentator sounds intelligent, as if he might really have had the ability to produce an effective, well-crafted chiller. As things stand though, this picture comes off as just a wild stab in the dark."
2,SUICIDE NOT SO PAINLESS,If you were a young woman who stopped to get gas at a station without any attendant and you went to the restroom which is totally dark would you still go into a stall to pee? You can guess what happens. That's an indication of the credibility of this low budget yawner. The movie is slow-paced and lit so you can see either spores or gnats in an angelic glow. The acting is mediocre and the killer's identity pretty obvious. Not much to recommend.
3,Killer with camera,Movies that have a killer tapeing his murders is a creepy idea. Another movie like this on is laid to rest difference this onee takes more suspence and laid to rest is a gore show . I would say this is the better of the two it's got good kills one thing is it's a slow paced film but if you stick in there it's a nice little slasher indie picture. problem is that if you've seen friday the 13th halloween and I mean the origanal you've seen this plot and stuff already. But all around if you like low budget slasher movies check this one out.
4,Peaceful and easy!,"This collection of music was available in Hallmark stores in 1997, and as expected from Hallmark, it is a light jazzy set of instrumentals. It is restful, sure to ease your road rage as well as lull the beasts and children you haul around with you on the road! It is lightly energetic at times, enough to keep you going all day as you run errands, pick up children, drive to work, or on a long roadtrip!"
5,Uk82 for you,"One of my favorite '82 bands. This is an exellent album for any punk rocker especially into '82. Although underlooked and unheard by many. I would sujest this one first and then getting Process of Elimination. Great band if you like Abrasive Wheels,Defects, Skeptix, One Way System, and others along those lines. They jsut rule OK!"
2,Not even close to the hype.,"This album is a horribly dull experience. The music is run of the mill, not interesting or ground breaking in anyway. The only way anyone would be impressed by it is if they've been living under a rock or listening to boy bands or some [thing] like that. Beth's voice is a total bore. She seems to have, perhaps, a 3 note range. Every song sounds the same. Very little tempo changing or emotion change. Lot's of out of key signing too. Just a complete disappointment overall. Maybe I just don't get it."
1,Disapointment,"There seems to be a shift in the direction of real country music and the people who sing it--All seem to be playing to the same consummer--younger and more POP oriented--This is a colection of more of the same , sung with a mournful , crying sound and is not a Folk style or a Country style that I would ever buy. Bring back the sound of all the GREAT folk groups and single performers of the 60's and 70's that were a joy to listen to.If I wanted Garth Brooks histronics and fancy sets and hollywood style productions -- there are plenty of music videos around--Lets not forget that a song thats pleasant to hear , with flowing melodys and thought prvoking lyrics are the ones that never go out of style--it seems that everyone is pandering to the ""children"" with the music and the video selections that are made avalible--Maybe someone should take a hard look at what is being forgotten and ask why. You might even make a little money selling good instead of following the herd."
3,I like it.,"I'm no Beth Orton expert and this is the only album I own of hers, but I really like it. It's one of a few albums I can listen to whether I'm in the mood for folk or electronica. It kind of walks that line. Reminds me of Dido that way. ""Stolen Car"" I'm thinking is the lone hit here, but most of the album sounds the same and is just as good. This is one of those albums I heard and asked ""who is this"", and now others do that to me. Very pleasing all the way around, and the cover photo is one of the best pics I've seen of her. It's only pennies here used, so just get it."
5,"addictive, hypnotic","Sure Beth Orton has a limited voice, but she's not afraid to push it till it breaks, and the result is an album of dreamy, enveloping emotion.Central Reservation is sad, hopeful, and full of love - and there are a few goosebump-intense moments - ""Stolen Car"", ""Feel to Believe"".An album that just makes you want to lie down and stare at the ceiling, until you get up to play it again."
4,Great Mood Music,"I first discovered Beth on ""The Next Best Thing"" Soundtrack with ""Stars All Seem to Weep"" and then I picked up Central Reservation recently and I really like it. It's good to listen to in the car or at work. It's not obnoxious like most of today's top 40. If you like mild easy listening this is a good pick."
5,The Best CD I Own,"Thi sis a phenomenal album- PHENOMENAL. Beth Orton's talent as a singer/songwriter are absolutely unparalleled by any standards whatsoever. Her lyrics are gorgeous by themselves, and her music does them justice in this, the best album of this or any year. She's very real and emotionally naked in her songs, a sign of total bravery. Everyone should own this album, because it has a little something in it for everybody. Every song on this album is an absolutel winner, with highlights being ""Stolen Car,"" ""So Much More,"" and of course ""Feel to Believe."" An essential recording everyone should have."
4,Keen,"This is a really good CD. I enjoy it thoroughly, I heard it playing in Borders and bought it after hearing 30 seconds of the first track. This CD is really really good. I love Beth Orton. Her vocals and guitar playing are wonderful. Some of her lyrics make me laugh and cry because I know that she speaks the truth."
2,I am unimpressed.,Fairly repetitious explicit lesbian lyrics in a folk music format deliver less than could hoped for.
1,THIS ALBUM BITES!,"I might as well thrown my money in the garbage cause thats where this CD is. Absolutely the worst album I have ever heard. I found her voice irritating -harsh, there was nothing driving her lyrics- no melodical force, just bland tiresome trash. I certainly did not hear what everyone was raving about. If your favorites are among Sarah McLachlan, Tara McLean, Tori Amos, Heather Nova ..etc...do NOT buy this album, you will be greatly dissapointed."
1,A horrible CD that didn't live up to its hype,I was really disappointed when I got this CD. It was just really dumb and a waste of twenty dollars.
1,Why do people like this cd?,I had high hopes for this cd after reading all the high praise. And it's true -- she has an interesting voice. But she can't hold a tune! And the songs are depressed and depressing. It's like a musical qualuude for the tone-deaf....
2,Can you stay awake?,"This is slightly better than ""Daybreaker"". ""Stolen car"" is a amazingly good song and the only reason that I rate this 2 stars instead of 1 star. Too bad Orton other material isn't that good. I can admit that some song here and there is alright, like ""Devil song"" but most of the time it's like a sleeping pill - nothing ever happens! If you don't believe me - buy it, put on, fall asleep... And if like this kind of music I won't be surprised if you'll find the awful ""Sebastopol"" by Jay Farrer exciting. You don't have to thank me for the tip!"
5,speechless,"What can I say about central reservation. What can anybody say...., ehhh......, I ehhhh...... well....I think.....eh..... Ok I'm just speechless. Those liricks, that voice.......ehh, I won't say anything at all, just listen to it yourself."
4,Overhyped But Good,Saw the raves online and in print - bought the disc. Even went to see her play live. She is very talented and this is a really nice album but it's not earth shattering stuff.
2,I don't get it.,"For all the hype surrounding this album (in the high brow New Yorker even!), I thought this album really quite average. Lyrics were hackneyed and music too dramatic. Am I missing something?"
4,Not Album Of The Year,"This is a very strong album, but not album of the year or anything. The songs are quite nice but after repeated listens you realise how limited Beth Orton's singing is. Most of the songs on the CD are sung in the same style/range which makes the record sound very monotonous."
4,Not bad,"Central Reservation is pretty enjoyable. I definitely like it better than her first CD. Her voice and singing style have changed very little but the music is much improved. Lord knows we could all use a little more techno-folk in our lives. However, this is not a 5 star disk. Methinks people are a little too free with the 5 star rankings around here."
5,A definite keeper,Unique voice. Liked all the songs on this CD and is a definite keeper in my inventory of musical CD.
5,"A CD for any mood -- happy, content, romantic, sad, pensive","I love this cd -- and for the first time ever, I bought a cd without even hearing any of the songs first. I had read reviews in Details magazine and on Amazon and thought I'd take a gamble. It was well worth it!! I can't wait to buy Trailer Park!"
5,Really special and very addictive,"I can't get this cd off my player. What a wonderful voice combined with really a first rate band. She makes wonderful lyrics too. I would put this one on a ""must have list"""
5,"If this is in you car, you may end up past your destination!",Give Beth a chance to enter your subconsious. Let her sound and spirit connect with the good and the difficult. She is well-rooted for a young performer. And she is able to match the CD in her live performances...a plus in my book. Is there a web site for her yet??
5,an instant classic....in my opinion,"great vocals, the best songs are near the beginning, some later songs seem unfocused...if we all could sing and write songs like beth orton we'd have nothing to worry about"
4,I like it!,"This is the kind of music that is good to listen (or sing) to when you just want to unwind. The lyrics are great: I immediately fell in love with ""Stolen Car"" because of the lines ""you were sitting/your fingers like fuses/your eyes were cinnamon"". She's actually writing and not just throwing words in a random generator (like some radio bands I know *coughLFO*). Also love the blend of instruments, strings rule. I agree with the reviewer who cited monotony, but that's why I think it's good for destressing."
4,Nice,"This isn't a fantastic, 'Must Have' CD, but it's worth adding to your musical library. It's one of those CDs that become a trusted companion when life tends to get squirly and unfamiliar."
4,Four stars...and climbing,"Beth Orton's sophmore album is the type that reveals its layers over time, with each repeated listen showing more depth, beauty, and wonderful songwriting. Much has been made of Orton's electronic influences, as demonstrated by her appearances on William Orbit and Chemical Brothers albums, but she is truly a folksinger at heart. Indeed, the electornic touches that decorated Trailer Park don't seem to play as prominent a role on this album, though they are still there. it's just that they are more subtle. Beth's gorgeous voice is her greatest asset, and it really shines through on nearly every track here. Though the mood is downbeat and contemplative, songs such as Stolen Car and Stars all Seem to Weep (my current favourite) can get you moving. With so many differing influences weaved throughout her songs, one can only guess what direction Ms. orton will take next. All I can say is, based on her first two records, I am looking forward to following her career for a long time."
4,A solid follow-up,"This cements Orton's reputation as a master folkie in today's music scene. The loss of beats and production from her chem bros work and ""Trailer Park"" is an unfortuate turn but this is just as solid in its own way. ""Devil Song"" is like a female Nick Drake gone delta blues; it must be heard to be believed. ""Sweetest Decline"" shows that (unlike many writers of sad songs) she's just as facile with more joyful and upbeat dreams. This work breaks little ground but it cultivates the fertile earthiness of its source material into something truly beautiful."
3,Rare Dorothy Dandridge treasures,I took a chance ordering this one in hopes of seeing an hour of performances by Dorothy Dandridge. I didn't read the product description carefully enough because I soon learned that only half of the DVD (about 30 minutes) is performances while the other half is movie trailers and snippets. I've enjoyed watching it despite the graininess of some of the old clips.
3,30 min of songs - 30 min of movie trailers,"What is included in this DVD is good but there's really not enough to satisfy Dandridge fans. There has to be a lot more film of Dorothy Dandridge singing in nightclubs and on TV available somewhere.The producers of this DVD dug up a few ""soundies"" and a couple of TV performances and combined that with a some movie trailers. There is some narration that provides a little context. The narration is pretty good but the overall quality of all the films is very poor.Soundies were an early form of music video that were produced in 16mm and played on a type of jukebox found in nightclubs, bars, restaurants and other public places.It's a real shame that so many of Dorothy's films and musical performances have disappeared or are gathering dust somewhere because of licensing issues. She deserves a lot better, but this is just another tragedy from a life that was full of tragedy and ended all too soon."
1,Save your money for a rainy day........,"It's not worth wasting your valuable money on this CD. The songs are OK, but the voice is not good at all. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Toomany songs for this voice,It seems like its never going to end!! Very long CD!! Her voice is horrible. I thought I was going to be torturedfor days!!!
1,"""What is that....","strange sound?"" I wondered when I listened to this CD! Guess what?! It was Graciela singing!!! This singer's voice is very inclement!! I dont think she should even have a record deal. Save your bucks from this nonsense!! It's not good!!"
1,This bites!!!,I think if you like nice music you wont enjoy this cd at all!! I hate every torturing minute of it!!!
5,best buy,"this has got to be my favourite album,great arrangements and very entertaining.This is one of the best trios around,Ray Kennedy is an astounding piano player, and Martin Pizzarelli is one of the most solid bass players around.Please someone tell me why John Pizzarelli isn`t a household name, he`s a rare talent. J.P swings through an assortment of standards plus his own compositions i.e the ballad ""better run before it`s spring"" and the ""polliwog song"".Both these songs are delightful and beautifully played.John`s vocals and jazz guitar are superb throughout this double album.Buy at least two albums just in case you wear one out with continuous use."
4,Pure talent,You can tell that he feels every note played. I usually don't care for guitar music but he is one of the greats.
2,"If you've ever seen him live, don't bother with this cd","It's a fine cd if you've never seen John Pizzarelli live. But if you have, there's no reason to bother with this. Half the songs are the same ones he was doing live 5 years ago. The best song on the cd, I Like Jersey Best, is an exact duplicate of the arrangement on PS Mr. Cole. There's just too many other excellent cd's out there to invest in this one. As far as this cd goes, he's done it all before. Many times."
3,Upbeat but ultimately disappointing,"Although I agree with the first reviewer on most points, I have to admit I dislike John's singing. Much too nasal for me, and insufficient range. I wish John had taken some singing lessons because it does sound like he has it in him. However, you may very well disagree with my opinion because many vocal enthusiasts don't mind a nasal sound at all. On to the instruments then: no complaints at all, in fact, I really like the performance and the way that the recording brings in the audience, but not too much. I will not be buying any more Pizarelli, but don't let me stop you."
3,SAME CD DIFFERNT NAME,"This cd, is the same cd as THE BEST OF STYX, only this cd is missing one song, so go buy THE BEST OF STYX. GRADE B"
2,Completely Worthless-Almost,"The only reason that I bought this disc is because it has the original ""Lady"" on it and it was cheap. I was not expecting anything else, and I wasn't disappointed. There are no other good songs on here and whoever put htis disc together should be fired."
5,The Best!!!,"This single is great!! The harmony in ""How could I let you Go?"" is awesome!!! Just listen to their songs and you'll be hooked. This single is must have!!! The best!!"
5,Good beat and fantastic vocals (particularly from Trey),"This is track 6 on the second albu, a very good choice for a single it is too. With great vocal performances from the boys showing their vocal range, amazing production and a catchy chours, a sure fire hit in the US Bill-borad charts. Some great rkixes of other tracks on the album on the CD as well."
3,Frightningly Disturbing,"Four years ago I attended a community Halloween ceremony for small children. Sitting there my eyes grew wide hearing ""Barbie Girl,"" a song I feel is not intended for children. On top of this, I could hear the children singing along, word for word! It feels like there is no more cutesy original songs. There are some things children shouldn't be exposed too. When has ""Friday The 13th"" ever been a kids movie?Though this is one of their better discs in safe content for young kids it still bugs me. It's shocking the rise of songs unsuitable for their age range."
3,It's okay,I purchased this cd for my 7 year old daughter and 9 year old son. They definitely did not seem interested in the music at all. I'm assuming that's because most of the songs were popular while I was growing up. Definitely wasn't a hit in my househould.
1,Noooooooo,"Thriller is the ONE song I like by Micheal Jackson(not counting the Jackson 5) I saw/heard it in 13 going on 30 and thought it had a good beat to it. and when that dude starts talking near the end, some of it goes like this:Must stand and face the hounds of hell,and rot inside a corpse's shellNow would you really want some 6 year old listening to that? I bet they don't even have that talking part at the end. Oh, and I would love to know exactly how they got permission from Micheal Jackson :o"
1,A poor man's NOW Compilation,"If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player. but if your children are six and up. Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs. This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it. This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap. Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old. pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa. This is Pop music for impoverished folks."
1,HAHAHAHAHAHA THIS SUCKS,Im a kid ok and i hate this cd. its songs r bad and i dont think i would b able to listen to this cd for another minute even tho i didnt buy it. i listened to parts of it and its horible. DONT BUY THIS. well the poeple who like to eat glass mixed with dog food will like this. other than that its horible!
1,NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!(...),I hate this cd! THe kidz bop people probably have to beg BAD singers to be on their cd. NOBODY LIKES THIS CD!!(...)
1,AAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!,"This one makes sense, because the fact that Kidz Bop is in existence is very, very scary.You know someone was gonna say that sooner or later."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","The book is impressivley researched, but in my opinion the author never really brings the story alive. It reads like a long newspaper article, not a book. There is no emotional connection to the material on the part of the author. It winds up being nothing more than a numbing litany of names, dates and facts. Really disappointing."
4,#2 in the series,"I really enjoyed Dark Watcher, which is why I bought Storm Watcher. This second book in the series delves a little deeper into the characters. Unfortunately, I had started reading this one about a month ago and had to put it aside for a time. I picked it up recently and haven't finished reading it, but it was easy getting back into the story. I'm looking forward to finishing this one and moving on the next in the series."
1,Review of Storm Watcher,"Horrible book. Insipid, uninspiring, weak characters. I couldn't even bring myself to finish this book (let alone the series) and I'm massively OCD about books and finishing them.I'm shipping back all this author's books to the library. I had faith, I had hoped that I could see what others see in her, but good grief.. this was really, really bad."
3,"Not a very ""spicy"" read","Good story line, however the book could be hotter in the love department. I huuried to finish the book not because it provided excellent reading, but because I wanted the experience to be over quickly.Not a bad read if that's all you have on your bookshelf!!!"
3,Slow Read,I felt this book is average. It is full of information concerning the Christian walk of faith. It better to read it along with other books on the topic.
5,enjoyable light read about Rand's ideas,"""The Age of Rand"" might technically be a philosophy book, however its easy style makes it a pleasurable poolside read from start to finish.The book contains well written explanations of Rand's concepts together with mention of movies and books by other authors that have tie-ins. I will be reading a few of the cited books in the future.I also enjoyed the historical blurbs, particularly regarding New York City history and numerous comments about George Washington. I happen to read a lot about both Washington and Rand and was pleasantly surprised to find both featured in the same book.My only criticism is that I cannot understand how the author can advocate the ""non-aggression principle"" of Objectivism while praising labor unions at the same time.John Christmas, author of ""Democracy Society"""
4,age of rand,"I liked this book. It's not a book about Objectivism so much as about Objectivists. The author is an old New York Objectivist and knows a lot of details that haven't been published before. He takes (very general) ideas seriously and thinks about them for himself.This has a rare quality in Objectivist books, hundreds of new ideas. Only a few are very good ideas, but that's not so important. Finding new ideas is the hardest part of intellectual growth. And this book has another quality sorely missed among Objectivists: a complete absence of malice. When criticism is just, he doesn't shy from it: Ayn Rand swore her closest companions to secrecy so they could deceive the rest of the world. But there's no glee, no ""gotcha,"" no need to rub our noses in it. Nor is there malice toward the anti-Rand camp. I never thought I'd see it: a benevolent book about Objectivists."
5,A challenge to individualism,"Longino's work challenges some of the basic assumptions common in Western theorizing. She really reconceives the role of society in the creation of knowledge. As Richard Grandy suggests, this is as good as it gets."
5,Misa Tango,"Misa Tango is a 2000 Deutsche Grammophon recording featuring two composers, i.e., Luis Bacalov and Astor Piazzolla. On the Misa Tango we have the immense pleasure to listen one of the greatest tenors, the one and only Placido Domingo. Myung-Whun Chung leads Coro et Orchesta dell'Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. Music notes are available in French, German and English. A very invigorating and lively recording. I very much enjoyed it. Highly recommended. 5/5."
4,Not quite what I expected...,"This video is a great idea! I really wanted to learn these dances, and Padma Chebrolu is great. However, I expected this to be filmed similar to other dance videos (my experience being in M.E. dance), showing the steps and practising TOGETHER. This video shows you the step once or twice and then covers the next step. I would have preferred to cover the dances a little more thoroughly. I guess I'm just very visual and need to see things a few times in succession before I get the hang of it.Regardless, this is very informative, and well done. Format aside, a great video."
1,for beginners only,Padma Chebrolu is giving an introduction to Bharata Natyam... the DVD is ok for beginners and people who don't have information about Indian classical dance.. but the mrs Chebrolu moves are not quite right and there are better introductory DVDs available...
1,The tape does no justice to Bharatnatyam,"In my opinion, the tape does no justice to Bharatnatyam. This tape is good for those who have no knowledge about Bharatnatyam. It is a complete spam. The chollkutt(speech) is very poor and the words are mispronounced. I am not sure which style of Bharatnatyam it follows. The dancer's face has no expression or shows no enthusiasm. The dress attire of the dancer too doesn't follow any regime. The dancer's movements are not energetic. (...)"
1,"Comparatively speaking, this is a pricey DVD - definitely not a bargain!","Among the educational Bharatnatyam DVDs, this one is the most expensive. Yes, the image quality is better than in, for example, the Drishya Bharatham DVDs, but what about the accuracy and precision of the technique, and clarity of explanations? Of course we cannot compare J.Suryanarayanamurthy, a Kalakshetra professor, with P.Chebrolu. So why P.Chebrolu's DVD should be 3 times more expensive than J.Suryanarayanamurthy's?Instead of giving too many cultural introduction (we all can read books, and do not need lectures on DVDs!), P.Chebrolu should have given more time to actually show and explain the moves deeper.Anyone who actually tries to learn anything with this DVD will end up with too many unanswered questions."
3,Dances of India Learning Bharata Natyam Instructional dance,"I wish I had read the reviews of others before I bought this video, because I wouldn't have purchased it.Don't buy this if you want to work out through learning dance (like I did). The dance instruction is constantly interrupted with explanations of culture and such. The dancing will in no way get your heart rate up.This is an excellent video for people who want to learn simple dance steps and how to pronounce and spell cultural dance movements. Also very informational concerning other areas of Indian dance culture."
1,no instruction at all,"The images are old, and it contains about 30 minutes of jumps and tricks. If you are looking for a video that explains how to gybe step by step or other basic to advanced maneuvers this is not for you. (not for me either)"
4,Great for Intermediate to Advanced sailors,"I believe this DVD is Award Winning & one of the best-selling HOW TO Windsurf movies ever, intended for sailors that know how to waterstart.Footage looks a little older but there are moves no one else is even trying.Instructor Sean Ordonez and Pure Image productions Hawaii use a unique teaching technique with multi camera angles (helicopters, jetski, water, POV Mounts & Telephoto) to put the viewer in the pilots seat without too much talking that can be confusing at times. They say ""a picture is worth a 1000 words."" so this will take your sailing to the next level."
5,The best history show ever!,"The way this show teaches is amazing... mixing humor, with travel scenes to actual historical sites, and leaving in all the history that some ""pc"" schools have to leave out. I didn't really know much about the founding of our nation until this series. Thanks so much!"
5,"History Made Fun Yet Still ""Meaty""","Most history programs either satisfy the professor types and bore everyone else; or are too watered down with fluff and entertainment. I don't know if any other history series does as good a job as this one in finding the right balance. One of my favorite aspects is you don't get the same old stuff we've heard a hundred times before. Of course not everything is breaking news, but there's a lot fresh perspective and facts many historians ignore because of the religious nature in them. Dave doesn't come across as an uneducated host reading cue cards. You can tell he knows history and is passionate about it. What is most enjoyable for me is Dave's connection of events. He has a knack of ""connecting the dots"" as it were with history. It's history without a biased agenda, which is refreshing. I'm a fan!"
5,Drive Thru History is an amazing resource!,"I have all the of the Drive Thru History videos as well as the character education pack and I love them all! I use them with my middle school students and they love them too! These videos make history come alive and Dave Stotts, the host, is very knowledgeable and entertaining. He brings just the right amount of silliness to keep young people interested, even when they don't generally enjoy history. I especially appreciate the Biblical history and insight that he adds. This is a must have for any homeschool family or Christian school classroom!"
5,History is fun with Drive Thru History,"I ordered these DVD's to supplement our history curriculum for our homeschool.My kids love them. Dave has managed to make history both entertaining and interesting.I find them easy to watch as well. They are informative and visiually stimulating.The DVD's are put together very well and Dave is just hokey enough to entertain the kids, yet cool enough to keep me watching as well.I'll definitely be buying more of these DVD's as we work our way through history."
5,Five Stars!,"I loved this DVD and learned a lot. They made it fun and easy. I am now going to ask my dad to if he would please buy Volume 2 for me!Marcy is very nice and I am going to write to her to thank her for the great lessons. I love playing Ukulele and will be able to play at a BlueGrass Jam with my dad. We are going to play ""My Darling Clementine"" especially with the funny lyrics! He is going to play guitar and sing, and I am going to play ukulele and sing. My brother who is 6 is also going to come here us play.This is a great DVD and Marcy is a lot of fun. I also have Marcy's teaching on guitar, but my hands are too small yet, so Happy Traum told my dad that playing the Ukulele would be a good idea for me, and I really love it.I learned to play chords and some fun songs like On Top of Spagetti, Bingo, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Row Your Boat, and others. I think Marcy is a fun teacher and I like to learn from her.Christina Hyatt, age 8"
3,Dumb but effective,Once you get past the dumb jokes and Ginger the dog it is a good DVD to learn how to play the instrument.
5,LORDS OF THE MAFIA,This is another gem to go in your Mafia movie collection.This DVD gives you a little back ground into the SICILIAN MAFIA.I give this Documentary a 5 of 5 stars!!
3,this movie is about average,The movie was ok but did not compare to some of the other movies on the same subject. Although it was worth watching at least once.
3,Good Music - Questionable Documentation,"This 10-CD Set probably won't be satisfactory to the more discriminating collector. As a fan of traditional jazz (some call it ""Dixieland""), I like the selection of cuts & the sound quality on this 10-CD Set. And the substantial accompanying Booklet about the star performers is interesting. But BE WARNED that there are inaccuracies in the performance documentation. Several of the song listings are obviously incorrect, which casts doubt on the documentation as a whole. If my amateur ear can recognize some cuts that have an incorrect song name and performer name shown in the liner notes, just imagine how many other errors there might be in describing the cuts I can't recognize by name and performer. This Set is worth buying -- just for listening enjoyment -- IF you can get it at a substantial Discount."
5,great!,"i bought this as a gift and the person who received it, loved it. i would like to read it soon. recommended based on what i have heard."
3,a decent attempt from a n.y. triad,the breakbeat_trance sounds of catchy and non-intrusive tracks of this electronic triad prove their worth. it definately recalls the influences of '97 in a ten track ride of pitches and curves. most tracks never reach the pinnacle that you might find in other hard tranced tracks but what they offer is something that you can groove to any day of the week. i was just happy that it wasn't house music.
2,Somewhat limited to discussions in an American culture,"McLaren writes well and teases out a conversation with a woman who is searching for God, but not wanting to be pushed into faith either by religious jargon or in an institution way. He does this very well. The limitation is that the woman is in an American rather than a strictly secular culture. If you are in a somewhat ""Christian"" culture, this is a good book to read. If you are in a multicultural society or a secular society, you might find yourself wanting to look at other sources."
4,Foolish movie. Great soundtrack. Typical Burwell.,"This movie was quite the pile of dung. But the soundtrack, that MUSIC is so solid that it's certainly one of the most ingenious scores in the last decade. Much hype has been ascribed toward the Library of Congress remixes, songs featuring new background beats coupled with pleasant nego-songs (see also Moby's remixes from his Play album for a close comparison). Those songs are the highlight, no question, but Burwell's songs are not to be overlooked.Echoes of Fargo, Hamlet, Barton Fink, and The Man Who Wasn't There are present here, but Burwell isn't a leech when it comes to his music, and he takes a splendind, darker direction with this score than, yes, even Fargo and Hamlet - as dark as those were.Burwell aficionados won't be disappointed here, neither will fans of darker film scores along the lines of David Julyan's Memento, Thomas Newman's Flesh and Bone, and especially Philip Glass' Fog of War."
5,Best yet!,"About a minute into the movie, my son and I decided right away that we have to get the Soundtrack. What a brilliant composition and the soundtrack reflects on the movie so much, that when you listen to it, and know exactly what happens in the movie. Movie and soundtrack is the best I've seen and heard so far. EXCELLENT!"
5,For the Love of Music,"When the movie started, the music that I love within me, started. I wanted more! Excellent Job!"
5,The General's Daughter (Sound Track),"Awsome CD, all the music and songs are very moving, lots of power and feelings come out in the music. Lead song ""She Began Lies"" so very haunting and makes your soul move."
5,General's Daughter Soundtrack,"The music is excellent,to me the music MAKES me think back on the movie and it makes me curious. The soundtrack was the best music I have heard in a long time, that made me want to dance.It has a good beat."
2,wrong color,I was expecting to receive the one in black color. But they have sent me with a reddish brown color....
3,Didn't work well in my hydro system,"I use the GH flora series nutrients and this was highly recomended to go along with it. I use a (modified) GH AeroFlo system and got ok results at first. It was not until I STOPPED using this additive that I started to get the results that I expected. This produce would accumilate on the roots and sufficate them somewhat. Not enought o completely kill the plants but enough to decrease my plants health significantly. After I stopped using this product I saw a 40% increase in fruit yield!This produce does seem to work better in soil based systems.I used this once using a Co-Co mat and Hydroton and it performed poorly, building up in the mat and creating a poor growing enviroment.It has a place in gardening, but in my experience, it didn't work very well in my hydro systems. As a hydro gardener, I often try new things and different approaches; I find that it causes fewer problems when used at 1/4 strengths or less."
5,"Brilliant, simply brilliant","Picture Radiohead as a lounge act, Pink Floyd recording in Nashville, or maybe Peggy Lee on downers and you still won't have an idea of what this guy's all about. A jazzy, bluesy lounge singer's voice with lyrics that shred you like it was raining razor blades. Henry's voice doesn't convey the bitterness and cynicism of a Steve Earl or for that matter Thom Yorke or Roger Waters, but rather a sort of detached, downtrodden resignation. The result tears you apart. All of the songs are meticulously written, beautifully performed and produced, and get better with each listening. A few soar to greater heights. You won't be the same after you've listened to ""Want Too Much"" or ""Great Lake"" a few times.Believe me, you listen to this CD on a visceral and emotional level, not as a distraction to your humdrum life. It involves you as much as it entertains you...if you buy one CD this year, make it this one."
5,Perfect for the pocket,"This pocket-size book by veteran apologist Patrick Madrid is a powerful resource for Catholics that need a quick Bible verse to justify Catholic teachings.Not only does each chapter handle the most common objections about the faith (the papacy, sola scriptura, the saints, Mary, and the sacraments), but each also provides a plethora of Biblical verses to support the Catholic teachings in each case.The nice thing about this book, aside from its size (which makes it easy to carry with you), is that it provides Scripture for issues beyond the typical objections raised. Interested readers will discover Biblical citations on issues such as abortion, tithing, non-Catholic beliefs, drinking and other issues - giving it some merit even outside of Catholic circles.While there are several books like this in existence, few have gathered so much good information all into one place."
3,good pages to read. Ink stained top right corner of pages.,"Book was received in a timely manner. However the top right corner of the book was stained with ink. Pages were not affected, however the overall look of the book was affected."
5,reviews of religious books purchased from Amazon,the religious books were purchased to help me increase my knowledge and understanding of Catholicism and to explain it better to my friends of Catholicism. They proved to be helpful
2,A bit misleading....,"The summary for this book is a little bit misleading. It assumes that you are Catholic and trying to prove your beliefs to a non-Catholic, and even there it falls short by only pointing you to a bible verse and not giving any explanation. If I were Catholic I might be able to use this personally, but it won't help you with a non-believer. For anyone seeking answers about the Catholic faith it just brings up more questions. Try the catechism, even though it's intimidating. If it isn't in there, it isn't truly Catholic doctrine.""A Protestant/Catholic Conversation"" is good too."
3,Not the Best By beethoven Lover,"not completely a delight...shows little Beethoven in it all, deserves only about two or three stars."
1,BUYERS AND SELLERS BEWARE,The picture for this item is Cecelia Voice of Violet 19 and if a seller lists by ISBN for Cecelia Voice of Violet 19 this item comes up. Be very careful in listing and purchasing this item that it is the one you want.
3,Is a good book,This book has some good information about cross stitch lots of neat techniques. But if your just looking to learn cross stitch and intrested in broadening your horizens on the craft of cross stitch I wouldn't recommend it to you. Most of the time if you Buy a pattern and it uses one of the techniques it'll tell you how to do it. But if you love samplers you may 100% die for this book. Then again if you do alot of samplers with specialty stitches you may know all the stitches in the book as well LOL!
4,Good But ...,"This is a good computer Bible, but for the money, I prefer a program like AMG Bible Essentials which has the Libronix Library System built-in and can be integrated with other Bible study software. For about $15 more the AMG program has both KJV, Apocrypha and NASB, including a lot of other capability, like Greek translations, word study, exegesis, parallel Bible comparisons, etc. The Rainbow Bible is an older issue and shows its age by not offering features as mentioned above. Some benefits of this Bible include both NIV and KJV translations, color maps, Matthew Henry's commentary, Naves and a version of Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The various colors can be distracting at times, but overall it is worth considering, particularly if you like the NIV."
4,Item is as expected and performs fine.,I decided to freshen up my old Craftsman compressor in stead trashing it. I am glad I did. With a new paint job and new switch (so now it turns off when it reaches 100psi) it works like it did 25 years ago. The switch is pretty straight forward and works fine. There is a wiring diagram; just put the two black wires side by side and the two white wires side by side.
4,"Lots of energy, some melodies...","High energy, classic late 70's punk sound (I don't know when it was actually recorded). I bought it because of the Fireball song - love the strong drive and sort of uplifting melody of chorus. I don't listen to this album repeatedly but Punk Rock Collection is a nice refreshing addition to a punk rock collection (hey they wanted a pun they have a pun)."
5,Our new DEMO CD!,"This CD was recorded at a 96K sampling rate. It sounds better than any CD we have tested in the last 3 years. The sonic clarity is astounding. The bass is clear, precise and very powerful. We've replaced the DTS recording of the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over with this CD for all of our in-home demos because it's the 1st disc that has sounded better. We are Home Entertainment System designers and we HIGHLY recommend ""Rick Braun... Sessions, Volume 1""."
4,"Good book, bad publisher","Martin Koch has compiled a lot of good information in this book. I haven't seen this much information about electric guitars in any one book. If you are only going to buy one book on electric guitars (why would you, really) this is a good one. He goes into winding pickups, various wiring ideas, and several building techniques. The problem (really the only one) is that the illustrations, while numerous, are quite small and poorly reproduced. You can see what each one is but there were obvious registration and focus problems. It looks like they used digital images of low resolution. The publisher should have taken more care. That said it's not enough to make me regret the purchase. This is a valuable addition to my library."
3,"Disappointing at First, Not a Typical How to Book","Not like the other how to books on guitar building. This author wants to be sure you are an informed student of guitar building. You will need your own set of plans first, then study the book before you proceed. Then you will be able to make the decisions as an informed builder. Very small print for a shop manual."
5,"Certain Gold !- If you build,this is for you. Missing this read leaves you lesser than, 4 sure.","Like 49'ers Gold. When you find this on your table,you will have stuck the Mother-load of details in rich building teachings.For those who need to know. Others write odd and end books. This book is to the point and does not lack in what a Luther will need to advance the true quality of there craftsmanship skills.People can buy other Media,but after you read this and apply the ideas to you new masterpiece,you will feel like sending this Book Author a reward for finding your piece of mind,for the knowledge imparted.I wish the best to those involved with all aspects of letting us buy this for such a small price,given all the wealth of knowledge inside these pages.Gods blessings to all."
1,A good door stopper.,NO good information in this book at all. The book by itself will not teach you how to build a guitar. You will find better information on the internet then you will in this book which if pathetic!
1,Lousy deal !!!!!,What a rip-off..... Item is very small and made cheaply. To add insult to injury the shipping was as much as the item cost. It probably weighs 8oz.My husband ordered it and didn't ck shipping. Buyer BEWARE !!
2,A disappointment,I bought this and was very disappointed when I opened it. To begin with it looks like a childs toy and is made of aluminum and plastic. It only holds about a cup and a half of doughnut batter and is hard to fill because it is so small.
2,Don't buy this item!,"I should have read the other reviews before ordering this item. It's very cheaply made as well as being so small that it holds next to no batter to make the donuts with. Spend a little more and get something that is of better quality, because this one sucks!"
3,Interesting look at Jean Nouvel's work,"This book is worth a look for anyone not acquainted with Jean Nouvel's work, or anyone wanting to get a better sense of his projects,philosophy, and aesthetic views. The images in this book are beautifully photographed (check the images on the Lyon Opera House). My one complaint about this book and many other monographs is that most of the concepts for the projects are left unexplained. It's hard to fully appreciate the work if the sense of space, and volume are hazy and unclear. It would be nice if some of Jean Nouvel's projects were documented with plans,eleveations, section cuts. But despite this fact, this book still holds my interest."
1,Wow. Total piece of s*&#,"Don't watch this expecting to gain insight on David Koresh and the Branch Davidians. (Yes, it's Koresh, not ""Coleman"".) Try the slightly more accurate ""Ambush in Waco.""Better yet, try:""Day 51""""Waco: Rules of Engagement""""Waco: A New Revelation"""
2,Disappointing,"I bought this kit for my 5 year old son as part of our homeschooling curriculum. We have enjoyed other kits in this series, but this one is a disappointment. The experiments themselves are interesting. However, what is lacking in this kit are any educational explanations so the child actually understands the results of the experiments. Also, the whole kit can be completed in one sitting."
3,"Cute, but fragile","This is a lovely glass server. The silver-plated parts do tarnish fast, so make sure to purchase Tarn-X to polish them. It's quite fragile. Definitely a great price, but it really IS fragile so be careful tightening the handle into the glass."
5,Too bad there's not a '6 stars' rating....,"Every now and then an album comes along that seems to stand outside the constraints of time. This is one of those albums. Beautiful and unlike anything you've ever heard before, this is one of those albums that makes you truly grateful that God gave you ears."
3,just Ok,"I love solo guitar, and listen to a lot of it. This CD is just OK,I bought the CD cause I like the song Jitterboggie, and after listining to the cd a few times, its by far the best song. Which is always disappointing when it happens. But take in to consideration, I'm very critical musician, and I know whats going on out there in this genre (there are many players not as nearly popular as Hedges that are writing and playing great music)."
2,This game is horrible.,"This is a sequel to tokyo xtreme racing on the major consoles. While the other games are good, not great, this one is horrible. You will wait through loading times more than actual racing. When you do race, the opponents are way too easy and the tracks are monotonous. Go with need for speed underground rivals. It's much better. Midnight club 3 is probably better too, although i've not played it."
1,very basic,"I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter who loves look and find books (the Disney ones and others). I was looking for something a little more challenging and I thought a ""puzzle"" might be interesting. The ""puzzle"" part of this book is: Help the little girl gather ingredients for the potion by finding: one yellow rock, one red piece of seaweed, etc. That wouldn't be so bad except that the items are ridiculously easy to find. This might be good for a 2-3 year old or a child that wants an easy look and find. My 4 yr old is just plain average and would find this boring. Also, the book is geared toward girls--you can see the main character (a young girl) on the front cover (I also bought one for my nephew that I am returning)."
2,Good points but just a handbook,It is a nice summary but is more like a power point presentation with the list of key points.Nevertheless I find it useful. It is more easy to remember the key points.
4,communication yes,This is not a cure all however it is written well for points needed in day to day communication. Its an easy read
5,Alpha Bus,Keeps my one year old granddaughter busy. She plays with it for a longer length of time than most of her other toys.
3,Boring,"There are lots of toys out there to teach abc's, this one is not engaging, boring and is not worth the money. Go with something more fun and educational. This is purely good as another truck or car, which you can get for less than the price of this toy."
3,cars of the future,"i enjoyed watching this film, it was funny seeing how people imagined cars to be in the future. I wouldn't think you would watch yhis film more than once though. I would only buy this if you are interested in concept cars"
1,purchased 4/2011,"I purchased this fly sheet combo in April of this year..first the leg straps connection tore out, then the belly band strap tore out - I am sure glad I did not put it on my horse that is rough on sheets.I will say the neck piece is in great shape. It is now July and it is unusable definitely not worth the money"
3,Stick to the original.,"The little kids on snowboards are back. But there not as good as the first.2 downsides are that the courses are harder and there's a tougher time using your control. So if you think the 1st one was cool, don't get the 2nd one it'll never be as good as the first one. Added Note- The graphics are not much better and moving your snowboard kid is brisk."
3,Be advised,"The variety pack no longer includes cinnamint, as I was disappointed to discover when it shipped to me. The item pictured is not the one Amazon is selling. Cinnamint has been replaced with sweetmint."
2,great idea - but go to your local whole sale club,I love buying gum this way - but 1/3 the cost at my local wholesale club! works out to less than 1/2 the cost of buying at the store individually (around $0.65 per pack)
3,Where's the flavor?,The flavor in this product disappears quickly and what you have left is a plastic-like product bouncing around within your mouth. Not a nice experience.
2,False adverstising!!,"The photo shows cinnamon and the write up describes it as well, but it did not come in the shipment!!!"
4,Must have for your engine,Really liked this manual. It was deep enough for everything but also cautioned you when things should be done by the shop (like injector testing and fuel pump repair). Pics and drawings were very helpful.
4,Its ok. Has useful info but not great detail,Typical after market manual. It covers so many versions of the engines that all it really does is provide general information and rarely enough detail that you would normally see in a manufacturer's service manual.It does the job - I only wish it had more detail.
4,Very handy,I've used these to protect the hardwood floors from our dog at my moms house.I've also used these to protect my dogs pads outside in some rough icy conditions.They have a good non slip rubber bottom and velcro pretty tight.they do loosen and fall off after a long while but well worth the price - and my moms peace of mind about her new hardwoods.
2,"Great Seller, but product fails to meet expectations","I put the dog boots on my golden retriever and they fit fine. My only problem was that I purchased them so my dog wouldn't slide across the wood floors, but the boots have no traction for wood floors. I will try using non-slip socks next."
4,Creating a family,"This movie is about several women & their different attempts at having children. Lindsay Wagner plays a woman ending an uncommitted relationship, left to find another route to motherhood. She seriously considers the available technology, while her friend chooses adoption. The movie attempts to portray the emotional and practical considerations involved in the major decisions of creating a family. I definitely recommend this movie."
1,Judith Orloff Auto Biography,"If you want to hear Judith Orloff talking about her life, this is a good program.I was looking for real hints and tips on doing what Judith describes herself doing. There was none of that. Just lots of talk about herself.Lots of books are like this. When you are looking for technique, you get personal anecdotes and not much more. None of this really helps."
5,Excellent for your Thyroid,"A herbal doctor recommended Vitamin B complex for my thyroid. Already familiar with the Good N Natural brand and along with changing my diet,Vitamin B-100 did wonders for my thyroid which is now very healthy. My T3 and T4 showed rapid signs of positive changes within 2 weeks. My doctor has recommended that I continue taking it. I got my doctor to accept that herbal supplements work."
5,Delicious AND Gluten-Free!,"My kids love these even though they are a little spicy! Really surprised me! Be sure to keep 'em air-tight though, else they can get stale. Also good n crunchy - can put toppings on them, dip, etc. Amazon's price beats my local grocery store by a bunch, and I need the big pack - they don't last long around here!"
2,caution - contains sunflower oil,"I was looking forward to trying these crackers but when they arrived, I found that the product contains sunflower oil, which is off-limits for my very allergic son. At the time of ordering them, the product info indicated safflower oil, so beware if that is a concern for you. Besides the mislabeling, which may not matter for most people, the crackers were totally broken due to inadequate packaging. I can't comment on how they taste since I threw them away."
3,Fairly Tasty,"Although low in fiber and processed with oil (sunflower), the rice snaps are fairly tasty and organic. It offers a nice break from wheat crackers, but rice crackers are very crispy (sharp edged)."
5,Packs a Cruncy Punch,"MY GF/CF loves these as a snack. They are crisp and light, but be ready for a lot of garlic flavor!"
2,Not worth it,Very garlicky. Its not worth the money. They can not be used for much with such a strong garlic flavor.
1,What Happened To The Theme Songs?,"I had to force myself to buy this CD because it had the Wrestlemania Theme, and it wasn't even the original. It was all mixed up with superstars saying things. It was nice but put the original song in there before the remixes. And where were the theme songs !! I had to stop at perfects theme because it was a joke to him and wrestling. Sorry, but what a joke of a CD."
1,WWF fan disappointed,I ordered this cd and coudlnt wait to get it.. When I got it I couldnt't believe it.. I was like this is it? I could not find a song that I actually liked. I have only played the cd once the day I got it and I havent touched it sense. I recommend if you dont have it dont get it but that is just imo
1,THIS is okay,This is okay. i mean they actually sing their songs. even undertaker. it is just like wwe originals. i give it 4/5 stars.
5,This is hilarious stuff,If you are a fan of the WWF and you want a good laugh pick up this album. It is worth the money for the hilarious songs by the Macho Man and Tatanka. This CD will leave you laughing and shaking your head at the same time for its lameness. So bad its good...
4,This is a real wrestling CD.,"This is not a bad CD, but it dosent have enough current songs. The best is Hard times."
1,A blatant attempt to cheat wrestling fans.,"When I first saw this album in stores, I expected the actual entrance music of the wrestlers from days of old. Instead this album contains cheap keyboard variations of the songs I expected. The only song tolerable is the wrestlemania theme song which is the only one of the songs I had ever heard. Just buy WWF Full Metal, volume 2, or volume 3."
4,Unadventurous listeners need not apply.,"Black Foliage is a big, sprawling, adventurous mess of imagination and creativity. The entire album is practically crushed by the weight of its own ambition but it never comes off as pretentiousness. Though the album is filled with more bizarre instrumentalization and experimentalism than the bands earlier effort, 'Dusk at Cubist Castle'; 'Foliage' is less derivative of 60's rock music and the effects are far more memorable here. Songs like 'A Peculiar Noise..."", ""A Place We Have Been to"" and ""Hideaway"" just wouldn't be have the same effect without the tape effects and added sounds. Though it requires an open mind and many listens to comprehend, Black Foliage is truly an astounding work that is a lot of fun to listen to as well."
4,I HAVE been floated,"Have you ever taken your copy of Zappa's Lumpy Gravy and (your particular quasi-legal version) of Wilson's Smile albums and tossed them into a blender? I would imagine that, if you had (and possibly garnished the mix with a Beatles track or two), you might have eventually poured Black Foliage into your cup.There are plenty of moments of brilliance (both of the songwriting and production varieties) in this album, but to bother with them without regard for the piece as a whole is almost disrespectful -- make no mistake, this was a piece meant by this founding E6 member as a piece as a whole.My paragraphs above beg you to see this as superfluous, but I find ""I have been floated,"" and Jeff Mangum's brilliant, tortured vocal, almost transcendent (as well as Andrew Rieger, Kevin Barnes and whoever else I think I hear putting a vocal down on this standout track). (...)"
4,Get Your Headhones,"Black Foilage is a great album: get ready to listen to the entire sheet of sound. There can be nothing gotten from this album by listening to a short clip over the internet.The Tremor's CD is more than the some of its parts. Music and sounds and ideas flow into one another at random. Frank Zappa did the exact same thing in 1969 with Uncle Meat, but few bands took up his giant gaunlet. Listening to Black Foilgae your challanged to rethink the concept of an album: Exactly like Uncle Frank intended as man first landed on the moon.Black Foilage is not a collection of songs, but a musical action painting with no start, ending, sides or cornors.There are pop and rock and 20th century classical music concepts here, but they are all torn to pieces and welded back together into a wonderful abstract sculpture. Who needs songs when bands like OTC can boldly draw you into a vortex like Black Foilage."
3,Somebody get these guys in a decent studio!!,"Pink Floyd's ""Ummagumma"" meets the Beatles' ""Revolver"". This band has potential to be genius, but please get these guys decent recording equipment and an experimented guy to mix their albums.The actual songs on the album could be brilliant pop but are downgraded by their production value. Indie or not, recording is a craft, a good production does not mean selling out. With this in mind,the OTC is on the right track.The Brits have been doing psychedelic pop for decades now, it's good to see the Americans catching up."
3,Disappointed,"If you're looking for something like Dusk at Cubist Castle, then don't look here (but maybe that's the point). Very experimental record here. Almost a little indulgent at times, this seems like a tape that they should have made for themsleves and a few friends. It is really a creative album. If your looking for pop hooks, however, you won't be as satisfied as the previous album. I do give the band big time credit for doing what they please, and not the sound that appears to be making a comeback from the 60's (beatlesque brian wilson tunes). People more familiar with the recording process and running tracks together and over each other and all that stuff will find this album really neat."
1,Don't loose your money & time,OTC want to make another White album. But...is not possible. The album is boring.
5,fabulous,great music. Nice Beachboysesque harmonies and playful sounds. many people I could see being intimidated by songs that don't fit a 12 song 2:30 minute length album. oh well their loss. concept album ideas in an enjoyable package. hope you're not scared of melotromes.Highly recomended
5,Delightful,"Though not as accessible as OTC's Dusk at Cubist Castle, this similar concept album has incredible charm and intrigue. Highly ambitious without being pretentious, and immensely entertaining, Black Foliage is as inventive, original, and ground-breaking as anything to come along in these post-modern times, and it's better. Elephant 6 keeps upping the ante on this exciting scene. If this wealth of progressive (albeit heavily influenced) material is any omen, I can't wait for what's next."
4,A Not-so-satisfatory Album From An Emerging Talent,"Though it is a highly praised album by critics all around the world,because it is too long,it is obviously flawed.However,with such creative process of making music,the music can go nowhere but getting better and better after repeated listenings.ANY COMMENT ON THIS ALBUM,E-MAIL ME."
3,Audio Gold,"This is a very interesting and catchy album. My complaint is that they could've played these songs a little more straight. Had they left off some of the bleeks and squeeks, and just played some of them as straight pop songs, I would've been more satisfied with the album. But I guess, that's not the direction they were going. The last song, ""Hilltop Procession"" is a suprising gem, especially after listening to some of the more aimless instrumentals. I will say that it is a great album for driving on the interstate, especially late at nite."
4,Typical Wilde Stuff,"Wilde fans will like it. It is short and maybe a little forced but clever and fun. If you are not sure if you like Wilde's style, you should probably go ahead and read this. If you don't like Wilde, you probably can't read anyway."
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be,"I've read ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" by Oscar Wilde so that's why I read this book/play. I didn't think it was as good as that one, but it wasn't bad either. It was quite slow to start, but if you have time on your hands it's not like you'll completely regret reading this. I would just rather spend my time elsewhere."
3,Better as a Movie,"I did see the movie first, but it definitely was better than the book. It was a little hard to read as a play unlike other plays I have read. Hard to follow who is saying what. Lot of descriptives that I am not used to in plays. It is an interesting plot line worth experiencing either as a book, movie, or both."
3,Not for me,"Sure it is a great read for some, guess I am not rea y for this kind of book...sorry, I tried."
5,Fun to follow,"Saw the movie, loved reading the play. Could visualize the whole way through. Would probably enjoy reading again. Interesting reading in play form."
2,AN IDEAL HUSBAND,"I LIKE FOOLISHNESS BUT THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH. MAYBE YEARS AGO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINING. I DO THINK THE TITLE AND THE CONTENTS IN GENERAL IS FUNNY, BUT GOING THROUGH ALL THE SILLINESS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME."
5,good product amazing quality excellent seller,good product amazing quality excellent seller !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!! !!!!!!!
5,"Chiltern: ""You prefer to be natural?""","Chevely: ""Sometimes. But it is such a difficult pose to keep up.""Perhaps not so well known as ""The Importance of Being Earnest,"" this has all the same banter, manners, and sharp-eyed look at the crumbling edge of the upper crust in Vistorian England. It pleases the attentive listener at many levels. Considered only as a stream of one-liners and clever quips, it delivers all you could ask for.But because it's Wilde, it's also a wild tirade against the mannered (sometimes ill-mannered) gentry. Behind that, it has a good deal to say about tolerance for the flaws of any fallible human - and Wilde could speak on human flaws with rare authority. And, like any truly great work, its examination of honesty (and dis-) reveals a good bit about today's world, a century later.I'm not normally a reader of plays. I don't have that inner ear that brings words on the page to life. Wilde gives me some idea what that experience must be like, and I'm grateful for it.//wiredweird"
3,"About the Kindle edition quality, not the work itself.","I read a lot of reviews on the works themselves, but personally, when I look at the reviews, I'm usually looking for quality of digitization. So for this work, while it's great to have a free edition, I would probably pay up for an edition with proper editing. The free edition does not capitalize many proper names and so it is harder to read the directions. Also, this is a stage edition, meaning that it is not written conversationally, but includes stage directions. If you're just in the mood for something free, then go for it. If you really like the play and want to read it properly, I'd pay up for a better edition."
2,Paperback came apart!,Nice art and the story had potential but as soon as you open up the book the pages came flying out. Will consider buying digital in the future.
2,Sorry end to a good series,"I liked the first two parts of this--the story was tight, the action was fun and there were careful, subtle threads of mystery and romance woven through. I can't explain this last volume though. It sets up some intriguing stuff but gradually loses its momentum and then simply ends in the middle of the story. There's no resolution for the threads that are set up here, and many of the threads from earlier novels remain dangling as well. The much-hyped ""cliffhanger ending"" is there alright, but it's never resolved or paid off. To add insult to injury, there *are* follow up pages to this unresolved story, but they tell a totally unrelated short story which reads like a bad fanfic.Very disappointing. A tight, fun series for the most part, but it just loses its focus for no apparent reason and tails off with a whimper."
5,wow,"Have you ever been reading a book and wanted to know what was going on somewhere else in the story? Or earlier? Or later? Or in the author's head? *Annotations* gives you the sense that you are looking out over the story and deep within the characters at the same time. Such a patient, delicate, tight weave. Tight, so there's a firmness to this writing, too. On the one hand, we get to see what's going on inside as we see the surfaces of things. The narrative is not left vulnerable to readers' whims, though. The constantly shifting perspectives teach us not just how to get through the book, but also what to make of it."
3,experimental biography that works - almost,"How does one write a generic autobiography? Keene has given us an example. In telling of his upbringing in St. Louis, we learn of the flight of whites from the suburbs into which Afro-Americans had moved, we learn of the heritage of the city as multi-cultural, of growing up with an alcoholic parent, of growing up gay etc. Only occasionally is the narrative ""personal"" in the sense of revealing something about the narrator which we could not know without the self-revelation of the narrative. The result is wonderful prose, interesting structure, and literature that exists only for itself - never revealing something new, specific about the human condition."
5,Una compilacion excelente,"Todas las canciones de este CD son buenas de alguna forma u otra. Comparado con sus canciones viejas estas son mas cortas pero retienen lo que hace especial a Ruben Blades, su lirica. En la salsa no hay nadie que se compare, y aqui esta su tesoro. Al final del CD hay unas cuantas canciones que no son salsa, una suena como vallenato o algo parecido y otra es algo muy original.En el resto a veces el coge riesgos que pagan en usar una instrumentacion variada. Muchas tienen un sonido muy unico. Ahora estos cambios de sonido las hacen sentir un poco raro para bailarlas. Este CD es mas para oirlo relajado que para practicar tus ultimas movidas en la pista."
3,No punk expert,"I like the usual trendy punk stuff blink, sum, etc and this was really good for the first 4 songs and then went south. Still worth it for atleast 4 goods songs in this day of one hit wonders."
5,Great new cycle,"This is a great new cycle of the Beethoven symphonies and shows that a great modern orchestra can still have a great say on Beethoven. Some tempos are alittle on the fast side for me, at times...but overall this is a great cycle. The orhcestra sounds terrific. The recordings are good, but not outstanding."
4,Good clean fun,"A remarkable adventure for old and young. Joe has a way of taking the least likely phrase or event and turning it into laughter and excitement. We still chuckle over the ""In the Bahamas"" song. My wife gave this to me as a present and I still thank her for it. Take an hour and be a kid again. This DVD will take you there."
5,A Classic!,"This video is a must-have for parents and teachers of small children. In fact, children who have viewed it all the way up through 5th grade in my classes have laughed and enjoyed it."
2,Poor Design,"This HUGE (compared to other printers in its class) printer has a very poor design when it comes to paper handling. The feeder tray comes in two parts that you hook together. The parts that connect two parts are all plastic (of course) and, if you are not careful, easily breakable. But that's not the worst part. The worst part is the paper sensor. The sensor is a black plastic thing hanging down on the tray right next to the rollers. Insert the tray at a slightly elevated angle by mistake and snap, the sensor breaks. Unbelievably poor design.The only saving grace is the 19ppm speed which is above average in its class.You would be better off buying HP Laserjet 3030 than this monster. Its same price, smaller, lighter and better."
1,DO NOT BUY THE MF5550 - KNOWN PROBLEMS,"I purchased the MF5550 to replace my old hp inkjet fax machine. Out of the box employees were complaining that they were having problems faxing. Talking to tech support they said that the MF5550 is not compatible with all fax machines. She said there is a known problem in connecting to Sharp fax machines. I was having problems connecting to a Brother and my old fax machine works just fine. When confronted with this she stated there could be noise in the phone line that the MF5550 is more sensitive to. They would not help solve my problem saying there was nothing wrong with their machine. Solution, I put the MF5550 on e-bay and purchased a new laser fax from a different manufacture. DO NOT BUY THE MF5550. It is a steamy moist pile."
1,Canon MF5550 Multifunction,"This product is referred to as a ""prototype"" Well--that's all it should have been--it should have never gotten through the exit doors at Canon. I spoke with a Canon customer service rep. about this product and he said ""That's what we get for having someone else design it for us.""The envelopes require three settings (2 on the computer and 1 on the printer) to print one envelope--I'll handwrite it, thank you. The feeder tray doesn't recognize label mini-sheets, so I have to throw out the rest of a full size label sheet after printing a couple of labels (bad for the environment, although Canon claims to be an environmentally sound company and expensive!).The most annoying thing is that the printer has to be unplugged and plugged in daily because it goes offline. Most folks at Canon won't tell you why--when they finally tell you what they think the problem is, they say it's not their problem. Oh--I see--you manufacture these devices in a vacuum and suck us in!"
1,great scaner great copyer don't by it for the fax,"I have owned one for about a year and only successfully faxed something once. If I want something faxed it takes less time to go to Kinko's and fax it. I have spent enough faxing things to by a new fax machine. It takes over 1hr to receive a fax, it had to be sent multiple times and we have a dedicated fax line. What ever you do don't by this for the fax spend the $49 dollars on a Panasonic it worked 100% better."
2,Hersheyesque,"I've been snookered! The price looked good, the reviews looked good, but the taste? Not so good.Kind of flat. No character. Bad aftertaste.I was hoping for a less expensive alternative to Droste or Valor, but this ain't it."
4,Ringo's Most Professional Album,"Released at a time in which Ringo's solo work was regarded more as a hobby than a career, ""Time"" turned out to be Ringo's most serious and musically consistent album. Though there are multiple producers and writers involved, the songs all seem tied by a theme: cautions about life's hard knocks from someone who's been there.The sound is professional, and Ringo seems to be trying hard to be a real singer here, not just some pal who likes to belt out tunes. It really raised my opinon of Ringo, and I'm glad I have it in my collection."
5,Time-Takes-Time - Great,"I think this is just one of the great albums for Ringo. I was around when the Beatles were a group. I think he has fared better than ever as a single. I love his voice and his band, so easy on the ears. Hopefully, he will release another one soon. He is the ""best"" and I listen to his CDs over and over. Thanks Ring Starr."
4,Rock Solid Ringo,"This surprising 1992 release from Ringo is easily one of the strongest albums of his solo career. The often maligned former Beatles drummer sounds much more comfortable singing than on previous releases, and his all-star band plays great behind him.None of the songs here would probably be considered 'hits', but there are several tracks worthy of praise. The opening song ""Weight of the World"" is just great, as are the love songs ""In a Heartbeat"" and ""All in the Name of Love"". Other standouts include ""Don't Know a Thing"", ""What Goes Around"", and the reflective ""Golden Blunders"" (yes, pun probably intended).This is not a landmark or otherwise classic album, but it is a lot of fun to listen to and fans of the Beatles will find plenty here to enjoy. Ringo is an often underrated contributor to the fab four that changed popular music forever, and on ""Time Takes Time"" he shows that he's more than capable of carrying an entire album and making it sound pretty darned good."
2,Ringosophical,"What happened to this guy? He went from being lovable slob who landed the most luckiest position ever to some self-crowned higher knowledge of human condition. And there is nothing wrong with that, but it does mean the music will suffer a bit.Not too much, as some songs will be deliberately 'carefree' (or am I the only who can see the CONTRADICTION). But Ringo, you used to be so much fun, but this album is SO serious. There are a few good songs, such as the mysterious 'Runaways' and a couple of fun rockers, but overall it feels like a philosophy lecture at the State University of Bloody Boring. Rating ** 1/2 (2.50)"
3,Same old schmaltz,"I love Ringo. I love his legacy, his relationship in the Beatles, and his voice. I've never been convinced that he is a dramatic, exciting drummer, but he seems to have done well enough with the Beatles. I bought this album after reading the reviews on this site, and after reading a book by Ken Mansfield who claims to be have been the master-mind behind its release. I don't find it to be something I am excited about hearing. It is just the same old stuff re-invented. It has some great session men on the album, and the music is tight. It's just that it offers nothing daring or new. It just the same old stuff by a dear musical friend. Not sure if I will ever listen to it again. I hope to, as I paid for it, but it offers me nothing musically or Beatle-wise, or Ringo-wise. Nothing. Perhaps I am being unfair, perhaps it will take time."
4,Nice Twist of Jellyfish,"The real reason I bought this was because of the collaboration Ringo did with Jellyfish and (very little) Brian Wilson. For the bargain bin price I paid for a used CD, the purchase was well worth it. Nothing on here that you will ever hear on the radio, but it is right up my alley, and I do recommend it to any fan of The Beatles, Jellyfish, ELO, etc. I would rate it a solid B."
4,Time takes time,"I think this album is one of Ringo's better albums. It has a good mix of songs, Iespecially like The Runaways! Great beat, and really is put together well. I wouldrecommend this album to anyone who is a Ringo fan!"
5,Good CD,"The types of people who will buy the CD are the people who know exactly what they're getting, and what they're looking for (i.e., music performance students and aficionados of the CSO). For them, any introduction to this music is hardly necessary. Jacobs' rendition of the Vaughan-Williams tuba concerto has become the defacto standard interpretation of this influential composition, and this is the only place you'll hear his complete performance (all three movements of it). Herseth, Still and Clevenger are all top-notch as well. Good sound quality, even if the Still Mozart performance (which opens the first CD) sounds a little like Muzak. This is a wise investment so long as you don't pay retail-store prices for it. Get it on amazon."
3,beautiful performances of mostly unexciting pieces,A friend recommended Britten's setting of the Blake poem in his Serenade and that is exquisite. The rest is beautifully performed but not very interesting. Ravel's Bolero is Ravel's Bolero. The remaining composers wrote lots of interesting music but the pieces in this collection are not examples of that.
4,Nice collection,"Great collection of concerti, some very familiar, some less so. Shortly after purchasing this double CD I had the chance to see the Chicago Symphony perform in Sarasota. Fun to see the principles at work on stage."
3,Pretty cool little unit.,"This tester would make a handy thing for a do-it-yourselfer to have around the house, and maybe even some professional use. The reason I recommend it for a homeowner, is that it is a very safe unit. There are no settings, just probe the terminal, and you know what voltage you have.The reasons I only give it three stars are: The LEDs are a bit weak, and if you are working in direct sunlight, cannot be read. Also, the audible continuity/voltage present alarm is also weak, so if you are near running machinery, traffic, etc., it is difficult to hear. Due to this, I wouldn't recommend it to a fellow electrician. However, if you are a homeowner installing an outlet or a switch, I'd say this unit will do everything you need it to, plus a little more."
5,Must have for anyone thinking of starting their own small business,"This book was great for me, as I was considering starting my own small business and want to have a store front business in the future. As all Nolo books are, it maps out the journey and what is is needed and what hurdles you might expect. I am a huge promoter of all Nolo Books, and this is another great one that I will use once I am ready to start my business and am done preparing for that first step!"
3,"Disorganized, Unfortunately","This is a good resource for finding documents that you will need to start or run your small business, but unfortunately I found it difficult to navigate.I run a small direct sales business (think plastic containers and home parties!) and even though a lot of these forms didnt' apply to my business, I was able to mark off some that I thought would benefit others I knew in small business as well. It really is full of great resources, but without a way to index all of the forms that make sense, I ended up having to browse it to find things I liked versus searching for things I need now.Unfortunately I was able to do an internet search to find the forms I needed, and it was not only free, but way faster than paging through this book.If you are really stuck with business letter and form writing and don't want to trust the internet to find these documents this is a great resource. It just wasn't for me and my business."
2,Disappointing,I had some pretty high expectations for this book and it came nowhere near delivering. There are a lot of better books on the market that explain how to start a business. Most of the forms in this book can be made yourself with minimal word processing skills.
2,Too Many Characters,"This is the sequel to Drabble's ""The Radiant Way"" and is quite a disappointment. There are simply too many characters to keep track of, many of whom are completely unnecessary to the story line. The most interesting character, Shirley, is not fully explored. Instead, the author details seemingly pointless escapades of characters who were briefly introduced in the first chapter, not to be mentioned again until the end. It is baffling.Also, many times she speaks directly to the reader, eg: ""Now, I guess you're wondering what happens to so-and-so..."" It's very irritating. I finished the book because Margaret Drabble is a fine writer. Unfortunately, every time I picked up the book, I had to re-read the previous half chapter to remember what was going on. Ultimately, this is a story that you will immediately forget upon completion."
1,Not Motown,"These are not the original Motown recordings and were not produced by Smokey Robinson, Berry Gordy or anybody at Motown. They are not merely re-recordings but complete re-arrangements using discofied styles and synthesisers which were simply not around in the early 1960s, and probably date from the late 1970s or 1980s.Buy a true Mary Wells Motown compilation instead for a just tribute to a late, great artist"
1,This was a dissapointment.,The only thing that I found on the album that was by Mary Wells is the photo on the CD cover. All songs were re-makes and dissapointing. I would not buy this CD again even if it was listed for $.01. It's not worth the shipping cost.
1,terrible,this cd was not by the original artist but a copy of her hits I was extremelly dissapointed as it was not advertised as such
1,Egomaniacal Self Righteous Prig,"The usual revolutionary psychosis on display. Committed to ""saving the world"" once he got power he was at a loss to do anything but make vacuous speeches and, of course, kill, until he was up to his elbows in blood.As he discovered that the real world was a bit more complex than his teenage formulations, he tried time and time again, Congo, Russia, China and finally Bolivia to escape into the role playing and costumes of ""man of the people"" but never duplicating the thrills of the Sierra Maestra until betrayed by Fidel he died alone in a mud hut, with the solace that millions of like wise vacuuous teenagers would someday wear his picture on a t-shirts while getting stoned."
5,Grandson loved this book,This was a gift and my grandson reported he really liked it. He is a graphic novel fan and thought this was very good
2,comparison shopping,"I ordered this iron as well as the BaByliss Vented Flat Iron priced at $73.99 to compare, then decide which would fulfill my needs the best for my slightly wavy hair. They were both easy to handle although this model was slightly lighter. This model has 4 heat settings, the other only 2. I tested both at their highest setting (180C for this one vs. 230C). The results were similiar. In comparing the two I noticed that the BaByliss has a slightly larger heating area, has a superior hair ""guide"" to keep the hair strand in contact with the ceramic plate, has ""cool-touch"" pads on the ends to help cinch the hair strand in tighter, and most importantly the BaByliss was constructed better. More expensive doesn't mean better this time. Go with the BaByliss."
4,The Tru Mellow Mix Master,"I have had the honor of witnessing the dopeness of Dj Melo Mix since the days at Whites Creek High School where we graduated together. The bruh has been doing this for over 15 years and still creating the mellow mixes. East and West DJs are cool but if you want to listen to someone who is innovative, check out what the South is all about. If you dont know, definitely check this out. Destination Cashville baby!!!!! PEACE! HEAD"
2,Not for beginners,"The patterns are lovely, however, unless you already know how to do swedish weaving, instructions are poorly written."
2,Good for more advanced weavers,"The book seems to assume you have some basic experience with this craft. It does not tell you how to figure how much yarn will be needed for any particular project. Nor does it give instructions on how to calculate the patterns for different size projects. The patterns are pretty, and the book certainly encourages you to step out and make your own creations, but leaves you guessing."
5,MAKING & MASTERING WOOD PLANES REVISED,POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE BOOKS ON THR MAKING OF WOODEN PLANES MEASUREMENTS AND DESIGN ARE VERY CLEAR AND SO IS THE EXPLANATIONS ON HOW TO MAKE IT .I AM BUSY MAKING MY FIRST BLOCK PLANE FOR PEOPLE THAT CANT AFFORD TO BUY TOOLS LIKE ME THIS IS IDEAL WAY TO GO AND BY THE THE WAY I AM 60 YEARS OF T AGE I WORK ALONE WITH ONE OTHER PERSON AND I MAKE SOLID WOOD FURNITURE AND MY MAIN INCOME IS THE MAKING OF KITCHENS AND FURNITURE AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AN AVID LEARNER OF OTHER PEOPLES WORK I AM SELF TAUGHT MAINLY BY READING OTHER PEOPLES WORK I OWN OVER 500 BOOKS AND IM STILL BUYING WHEN I CAN AFFORD
5,<<<<<<DONT BUY THIS YET>>>>>,As you can see the prices are WAY out if line. I spoke with Mr. Finck and told him of the robbery people are trying to pull off on these book prices. FEAR NOT. David will be self publishing this book in the near future....go to [...] and send him a note that you are in the market for this book at a reasonable price and you will be added to a list.
2,Could you follow this book to make a plane,"There is lots of great information in this book, but unfortunately I found it too disorganised. I used it in conjunction with David Marks DIY segment on European planes and in that manner it was very handy to have as a shop reference. A worthwhile book to have as a reference book, but not as a how too. Overall I am satisfied with it, but if I did not have the DIY segment to refer to it would have been difficult (not at all impossible) to build the plane using this book alone."
5,Another hit,"Schoenberg is not normally a composer that I have much time for, but Thielemann and the Orchestra of the German Opera in Berlin certainly shave off a few of his rougher edges. I can't say that I am now won over by Schoenerg, but I am willing to explore further. The album is well played and recorded. The Wagner too is very well presented.I am becoming more and more impressed by Thielemann. His love of the German repertoire shows."
4,My Favorite Christmas CD,I really love listening to this CD. I can play it year round. CD like new. It plays good. Did not have any scratches. Good quality product.
5,I love it,"I intalled it my self, pretty easy.I don't raise the volume to much for all the neigthborhood but is nice high and warm enough for me rocking in my car."
1,The title graps you but the movie stinks,"I thought that I would take a chance on purchasing this movie but I could barely get through the 1st disc of this 2 disc film. The action is horrible and the story line is even worst, David Chang is casted here but this great martial arts film legend could'nt revieve this mess. Will be giving this one away to someone I dont know and who can't come back at me later."
5,a masterpiece of martial arts filming,"this movie reminded me of the same action in Samurai Jack. The fight scenes, the music, the dialoge, all of it was awsome but i can't figure out if it takes place in Japan, China or whatever oriental country is out there.All in all this was a great film and others should really cheak it out"
5,Give your child a head start with these great DVD's!!!!,"Along with a little reinforcement, the Letter Factory taught my four children all their phonics at the beginning of their 2nd year. This set gives a great head start in reading. The other Dvd's are great too. We have been using the set for 7 years. The best things is when I put them in, they entertain them all at age 2, 4, 6, and 8 years.I will continue to buying these sets for gifts and our set will continue to get good use with another one on the way!!!!"
3,LeapFrog: Learning DVD Set,"The DVDs were well packed. I received them in a timely manner but problem is I am located overseas, in Singapore to be exact and the DVDs are not playing with our Samsung DVD player or Xbox. We still have to use our MACBook pro to view it. So i think the region on the DVD is not set to universal so it can be played and watched anywhere in the world considering that Amazon's clients are not only US / CAnada based but all around the globe."
5,Such a GREAT product!,"My son is 3 years old and has been a little bit behind on his talking. Since I ordered this series, his clarity is much better since he is learning his letter sounds(we've only watched ""The Letter Factory"" so far), but when he starts school in September I'm sure all the other movies will come in handy! The way they incorperate songs into learning is great and I would definitely recommend this to anyone with small children!"
5,Keeps watching it over and over,We've had this DVD for at least one year now and my now 4 year old is still interested in watching it. She had learned well from it.
4,Great!,"I had bought a Leapfrog learning dvd box set for my daughter several years ago and she learned a lot very quickly. I don't know what happened to that set so I had to purchase another set for my son. This set is smaller and doesn't have the number dvd included as my previous set did, but it does have the other dvds. My son loves watching them. He watches these dvds - one after another - and is learning his letters! Great job Leapfrog!"
5,Engaging and Fun!!,My 2.5 yr old son received these DVDs for Christmas and loves them! He learned his alphabet and began putting simple words together phoneticially. I also recommend the Fridge Words Magnetic Word Builder as he was enjoying this at the same time. Now he's 2.75 yrs and knows his upper & lower case alphabet and can spell about 12 words. I highly recommend this product.
5,Best learning tool out in a while!,The alphabet factory was such a great learning tool for my kids. I have two elementary school children and a set of twins. I did not have the video for the older two- bummer because the twins asked to watch this video and continue to do so again and again. They knew ALL of their letters and the sounds they make within a week or two. They also use the flash cards with each other or with me. I love how the flash cards have the letters looking like the factory letters on one side and the normal looking letters on the other side. 5 STARS!
5,Well done!,This is a great video for my 2 year old. I too actually enjoy sitting down and watching it with him. He is having fun while learning the sounds of the alphabet.
1,Price,"Bought this at $22.99 on 28-Aug-2012 & the selling price today is $14.98, in less than a week!!!What has been done to keep the price competitive??Ridiculous & felt so cheaped!!!"
2,This product is just the same movies in a new case!,"I thought that based on the new release date and the new pictures on the cases taht this was a remake of the letter factory and the talking words factory. I was very upset to learn that they are the same movie. I already have the others and didn't want or need them again. Amazon.com is usually very good about making sure their product descriptions are accurate, very dissapointed in them this time. Buyer be careful and make sure these are what you really want."
5,Love it!!!! Would buy it all over again.,I got these for my 3 year old little girl. We have started working on the alphabet in greater detail. I was on the search for something to help enforce what I was teaching her. I was also looking for something she would enjoy watching. I cannot say enough about these movies. She is retaining the information very well. A great purchase.
5,Buy this now! My child has learned so fast,"So this is my first review after buying on Amazon for a few years, but I had to leave some feedback after receiving this. My daughter loves this set and is constantly asking to watch Tad and for me to do the alphabet flash cards that are included. She identifies each letter and tells me the sound they make. I am so shocked that after a few viewings she was so enthusiastic about this and how it is helping her development. Forget Baby Einstein or any overpriced DVDs that claim to help your child. This is the only set of DVDs that has actually delivered results and she doesn't even get tired of it. The animation is not the most amazing quality, but the content is the best I have seen in actually helping children pronounce letters and another included DVD shows them how to put letters together to form words. I only wish they made more DVDs!"
4,good,My 2 1/2 year old asks for it by name and the letters are beginning to sink in. I do not expect it to perform miracles but it is a good way of reinforcing letter sounds and building letter recognition in a way that is entertaining to 2/3 year olds. follow up with flash cards with your child for best results.
3,"Hey, these are DVDs, not games!","When looking for computer games for my curious four year old, I followed others' reviews of their purchases. Not sure when exactly I was rerouted from my original search, but somewhere along the line I read reviews of these products that were ringing with praise and ordered them. My fault for not reading carefully, but THESE ARE DVDs, NOT GAMES."
5,Great purchase,"My daughter loves these videos. She sings along and asks to watch them. Her understanding of the alphabet changed when she watched these videos, she gets it now."
5,2 1/2 year old loves it,My 2 1/2 year old really enjoys this video. She repeats the sounds when watching the video and I have heard her saying the letter and sounds when the video is not on. Her 13 month old sister also repeats the sounds.
5,must have dvd set.,every family with a child should have this movie.is teaches so much.i have this movies on the leappad as well.my daughter learned so much.she is only 21 months and she knows most of her ABCs.thank you very fast delivery.
2,"my kid is 4, and i feel this is better for babies","My son is 4, but these set are good for babies. Maybe he is too smart? Another thing I don't like is that the words spelled in capital letters. I don't think it's a good way to learn words."
5,Classiscs!,"Picture quality is awesome! Love this movie! Soundtrack is mixed extremely well, must see for anyone who likes non-stop action!"
4,feedback,Quick delivery. But I am not abel to watch the movie because of the region system. I am working on Get another player
5,Great Patrick Classic!,"We love this movie! Anytime we are channel surfing and come across it, we have to watch it! It's one of the good ones!"
3,80s Flick Night,"Something about this movie always made me smile. I tell you what, it's not really the whole kicking butt and so forth. It's the characters in it. You got this guy, Dalton, he's mysterious, quiet, and a fighter. What you don't know is that he's a tad depressed because he didn't know that a woman he ended up with one night was very married and he had to really lay a beating on someone. He has a friend who tries to console him in his own fatherly way, but ends up dying because the true champions stand alone, everyone they touch will die.He applies what he learns in martial arts into his life, and into his job. Wounds heal and chicks dig scars.But that's something he'd be modest about. It's definately a movie that I would rent for an 80s Flick Night, if it was tagged with something like The Breakfast Club."
3,For The Music,"I love Jeff Healey and he is the musical component of this movie,I don't know if many other people would want to buy a movie for that alone. It has the eye candy of Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott to add flavor to the mix. A movie I have enjoyed over and over again."
5,Road House,"Road House is another of my favorite Patrick Swayze movies. It is not suitable for children to watch and I wish they had made it without the undesirable content, but it is a good movie."
5,Excellent purchase,"Great purchase, arrived quickly, movie plays flawlessly and great! 5 + stars GRADE A all the way across the boards. Would recommend this seller and would do business again!"
3,The movie was ok but I have seen patrick in better movies.,"Patrick could be such a better actor, but this movie didn't have the quality of the other movies that he has appeared in over the years. Also the movie was very groase and to bloody for me and you both in my point of view. But some people seem to enjoy the blood and guts in a movie; but how the world is turning out their is to much blood in movies. thank you for reading my review."
3,"Bad movie, but entertaining","Patrick Swayze plays a maverick martial arts expert with an NYU philosophy degree who cleans up a small-town bar full of rednecks. This is another so-bad-it's-good movie. There are some enjoyable fight scenes that keep the viewer interested, but some funny dialogue (""My way or the highway"") and brain dead script put this on a lower level than other action movies."
5,Road House,I order this for myself because I like Patrick Swaze and like to watch his movies. I have others and this was as good as his others are. The DVD that I got was great.
5,Road house,Awesome kick butt movie with Mr. Swayzee in fine form as the ass kicking bouncer. This is a good date movie for dicks n chicks as it has something for everyone LOVE IT 10 toes up
4,Radhouse,"Good movie and quality is excellent.shipping and handling from amazon is very fast,it took 2 days before I had itI am living in Europe,customers from my region must be aware of the regiocodeYou cannot play this DVD on most dvd players.I used a 3rd party software to decript the code, not illegal in Europe."
3,Schmaltz with violence,"Patrick Swaze plays our hero, a combination of philosopher, tough guy, and knight errant, sort of a modern day Don Quixote. Sam Elliott makes the movie for me, he's a presence even in a B grade movie. Sam should be placed as the cowboy iamgo, he looks the part, sounds the part and as far as I'm concerned can outact ""The Duke"" any day of the week in a cowboy role.This does not include what I consider to be Wayne's classic picture ""The Quiet Man"", in that he was superb.Back to Road house, why Ben Gazarra played his role the way he did is beyond me, he sounds, looks and behaves like a character from an old Looney Tunes cartoon that lampoons crime characters.I got it because I like to see the bad guys lose."
2,"Incredibly bad, but somewhat redeemable","Yes, you read that title right. From the moment Road House opens, you know that you are watching not only one of the worst action movies ever made, but one of the most unbelieveable and incredibly mind numbing movies ever made as well. Yet, there's something about it all that makes it a guilty pleasure for those who use the term ""suspension of disbelief"" rather loosely. Patrick Swayze (and he wonders why his career went downhill) plays the new bouncer in town who runs a foul of the local crime boss (Ben Gazzara). For the story, that's pretty much it, along with Kelly Lynch in a role where she seems to be the only person who isn't brain dead, and poor Sam Elliot as Swayze's old friend who drops by to help kick some redneck butt. Incredibly unbelieveable in the ultimate sense of the term, Road House is one of those movies that have to be seen to see just how bad it really is, but for pure escapists only, it can be a bit of a guilty pleasure."
2,Cannot see this version,I like this movie a lot that is why I thought I will get the Blu-ray version. Except it will not play as it is the wrong area code for Australia.
5,Road House,I enjoy watching each of these actors. Patrick Swayze proves he can be more than a dancer. Great job in this and hisother movies.
4,"Great Action, Classic Good Vs. Evil Story","Patrick Swayze delivers an excellent performance as a Smart tough guy brought in to clean up a road house bar in a town run by a less than honest citizen played by Ben Gazzara. When his friend and mentor, Wade (Sam Elliot) joins him things really start to heat up, both between the protagonists and Dalton's (Swayze) love interest the doctor (Kelly Lynch). This is a classic good versus evil story where the hero struggles with his own demons and conscience, but as he says it's what I do, I win. Ladies will enjoy scenes of a shirtless Swayze, men will dig the kick-a** bar fights! (Some bad language, major violence, some blood)"
5,Kung-Fu Philosopher,"""Road House"" is a cheesy camp classic. The late Patrick Swayze stars as a philosophy major whose job is to straighten up (in more ways than one) a dive bar. He cracks down on employees who have sex when they're on the clock, and he's ready to square off against the evil Ben Gazzara. While there's virtually no plot, viewers often get treated to the sight of Swayze working out shirtless. He's a philosopher--with muscles! Kelly Lynch stars as his love interest, to whom he tells there is no such thing as pain. Swayze's character is such an erotic shaman that even the men are attracted to him. It's good,cheesy fun.Patrick Swayze was a great actor and human being, he will be missed (1952-2009)"
4,Awesome Action Movie,This is one of the greatest bar fighting movies ever. Dalton comes to town and totally kicks tail. I am surprised this movie didn't start an entire franchise of Road House movies.
4,A Bloody Mary? Some Breakfast?,"This is hands down the best movie ever made! The timeless plot, the believable characters, the conflicts both internal and external, etc. make this a true gem of a movie. Although Hannibal Lector or maybe Darth Vadar are considered to be the ""ultimate screen villains"" is there any one character in movie history more frightening than Brad Wesley? Ben Gazzara's turn as the kingpin of Jasper, Missouri is remarkable. Perhaps only one or two times in film history has there been a better performance (possibly DeNiro as ""Jake LaMotta"" or Pacino as ""Michael Corleone"").However, Gazzara brings a scary realness to the role of Brad Wesley that has been long missing from your typical good guy/bad guy Hollywood movies. Don't get me wrong I love Dalton, but Brad Wesley steals the show. I highly recommend ""Road House."" It is an absolute joyride of a movie that is suitable entertainment for the whole family."
3,Waiting for the DVD,"This movie really got hold of me. Action, and Sam Elliot, great character. But what really keeps me wanting the DVD is the BAND! Jeff Healey and his guys are what keeps this thing moving. Unorthodox style, but the notes are THERE. If you like R&B;, kickin'tail fuzz and Canadians sounding like Southern rockers, you will never regret this show.Come on, studio. Time to get this one on disc."
5,Road House,"Road House is about a bouncer with a nationwide reputation as being the best at his job,although most say ""I thought you'd be bigger"". Swayze in this movie is more like Chuck Norris than Dirty Dancing. Make no mistake about it, this is about violence, not dancing or romance. Some scenes are VERY sexy especially in the back of the bar when they are ""on brake"", IF, you know what I mean. Hot women, barroom brawls, and borderline Rambo-like action near the end with Norris style martial arts and Sam Eliott(Ghost Rider, etc.) as his backup is Roadhouse. A Spike-TV favorite for years with TBS as a close second. Definitely aimed at more of a heterosexual, male audience which is what I am. Although not a Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris movie, Walker:Texas Ranger does pop up in your mind when viewing this. Pretty similar action and country setting. Highly recommended!"
4,The Best Bad Movie Ever,"OK, so this is not a great movie; But, the music is great. The bad guys are a bit too much like a cartoon and the director should have decided if he wanted to do a story about a bouncer or a great guitarist. But, somehow I find the whole thing just one of those little guilty pleasures. Mix Jeff Healey's music, with Swayze's moves, and Sam Elliott's voice and you get something that makes a Blu-Ray sing."
1,Packaging is a joke,"This will be the last blu-ray purchase I make. I spend 15 dollars on a movie and it comes in a plastic box with holes.....behind the discs. What idiot thought that was a great idea? You have to be afraid when you pick it up, much less ship the darn thing.I am done with blu-rays if this is what they are coming in."
2,Utterly ridiculous,"Not a single second of this beefcake exploitation flick rings the slightest bit realistic, from the endless fisticuffs to the bottles breaking over heads to the absurd scenes inside the ""Double Deuces"" where the world's baddest bouncer has come to restore order. Moreover, we are expected to believe that an actual medical doctor would fall in love in a second with this overgrown battler and accompany him to this unlikely establishment. Still, it is amusing to watch Sam Elliott in his maturity. Patrick Swayze was riding his prime here, though the acting skills were limited to smoldering looks and faked fights with lots of fake blood. This plays on certain Tv stations about six times a week, for some reason. Watch for the absurdity factor."
1,Dreadful movie from the big hair 80s,"A dreadful movie depicting men as macho s#$! and women as tarts. This was made in an era when people wore revolting tight stretch denims and hung out in pool halls and bars. It was also made to capitalise on the popularity of Patrick Swayze who had just appeared in the over-rated 80's teen musical ""Dirty Dancing"".A very pointless movie is ""Roadhouse"". It does not deserve a bare bones DVD release let alone this new special edition. Is there really a market out there for rubbish like this, or am I the only one with taste in movies?"
1,BAAAHHH! BAAAHHH!,"An instant classic, nothing short of a masterpiece. A brilliant script, flawless acting, and breathtaking cinematography. Will undoubtedly go down as one of the finest films ever made. Out of 5 stars, I give this one 10.75.......BRAVO!! These guys are the reason that all the sheep are so scared. Can't wait 'til they release the ""Super-Duper Deluxe Redneck Special Edition Series dvd""........YUK YUK YUK!!!"
5,Great Movie by Patrick Swayze,Great Movie by Patrick Swaze great film.All His films/movies are great ! ! !
5,ROAD HOUSE ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I think this is one of the best movies that Patrick Swayze everdid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He had a certain carisma about him. Ialso love Sam Elliott. He is a super actor. The music by the Jeff Healy Band was great. He is very talented for being blind!!!!!!!All in all, this was and is a TERRIFIC MOVIE and I am so glad thatI bought it. Patrick Swayze will be missed very much, but we canstill be with him through his movies!!!!!!! GOD BLESS YOU, PATRICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"A film of its time , just enjoy for its' own sake","This wouldn't have won 'Best Film' at all , but it is entertaining if you are in the right mood .The commentary by Kevin Smith was part of the reason I bought it and I was not disappointed .A film for the weekend with some friends around , especially those who lived through the time it was being made , for the fashions at least !In the end , it was a worthwhile purchase .If you want serious film , buy a Criterion Collection DVD ."
4,"Good flick, well worth the money","This is a movie anyone could follow, plus it's enjoyable enough you can watch it over and over again without getting bored. Some scenes are very perdictable, but there are a few really good fight scenes and a funny ending. Swayze crazy fans will love this movie cuz of the bare-azz scene and the strieght-forward dialog. My only complaint is that some of the women are not as attrachtive as they should be."
5,The best I have read in this genre!,"Dr. Colgan appears to be at the leading edge of research that is applicable to daily life. When you read this, you see how inadequate most current recommendations (like RDA and even the RealAge Health Quiz) are. Do you want to wait 20 or 30 years for adequately-proven, health- enhancing tactics to be ""approved"" by the Harvard Health letter and your doctor, or do you want to know about them and apply them now and prevent many problems down the road. For instance, Vitamin E took almost 50 years to be generally accepted as necessary. How many suffered needlessly in the meantime as their physicians scoffed at Vitamin E ""the sex vitamin"". This book puts you there now - it can improve health and save lives! Good Job."
5,the simplest single source for nutritional information,i found this book to be the best source of information regarding nutrition when i had to do a search. It allowed me to help my wife complete her chemo regimen ( for breast cancer ) in relatively easy fashion. I recommend it to anyone who wants an insiders input from an outsiders viewpoint.
5,The Bible of Health,"Dr. Colgan tells it like it is.Exposing the fads for what they are and giving us the real picture based on science.Truely fascinating, written with wit and brutal honesty. Dr. Colgan`s books have helped my business flourish."
4,May Not Be Adviseable for Novices,"This is another book that was totally incredible in its day, but with a 1995 copyright, some of the information is now outdated. Nevertheless, it still contains some excellent nuggets. If you're rather well versed in the field of nutrition, you will do well with this book. If, however, you are a novice, you may want to consider purchasing something more current in place of or in addition to this book."
2,Disappointed in Mr. Ego,"I read this book on the recommendation of people I respect and was very disappointed. I was looking for good information on the best nutrition and it may be there. But the author's ego seems to have gotten in the way. This is the first book that I have ever read where the author frequently quotes HIMSELF.According to Colgan almost everyone in the world is evil including all doctors, employees of pharmaceutical companies, and all government agencies. Fortunately we have the author to save us.Beyond that, the information was difficult to decipher. It seemed that the recommended dosages of vitamins varied from chapter to chapter.I have not read any of his previous books, but I am under the impression that he has run out of new things to say. And after several books, the organization and consistency should have been better."
5,Dr. Colgan makes nutrition interesting!,I've recommened this book to all my friends and family. A real eye opener! A book on nutrition that keeps you one the edge of your seat. How'd of thought
2,Good start--poorly executed,"This is the only viewing guide on The Golden Girls, which of course puts it miles ahead of anything else--there is nothing else! The core of the book is good. Episode guides for each episode, and information on the air dates, guest stars, etc. The synopsis are, at times, too succinct, but it's an efficient book.Now, this is where it gets bad: This is a published-on-demand book, and appears to have original been self-published. It's evident in that there are so many typos, inconsistencies in spelling, missing or incorrect punctuation, and layout inconsistencies that it's a very, very, VERY difficult book to sit down and read. Also, the section of the book that deals purely with the storyline inconsistences of the show is woefully lacking.The book could benefit immensely from someone with a good editing pencil."
1,Not Good,"Wow! I think this ""book"" was written by a high school drop out. I suppose it has all the basic facts about the show, but the writing is so bad it's distracting."
3,Not So Golden,"This book had more than it's fair share of proofreading errors. It's a published work that people are spending their money on--proofreading should be done. There's one place where a character is labeled Oriental--which is not an acceptable term--should be country specific or Asian. The section on inconsistencies in the series was interesting, but did get a little petty. Does it really matter what actor plays a slightly reoccurring role?The basic information is good for a true Golden Girls fan."
3,Could Have Been More Interesting!,"I just received The Golden Girls Viewing Guide. I think it could have been more interesting, but all in all a good attempt at preserving this wonderful show for us. Yes, I have seen some grammatical errors........but nothing that I can't get through. I really wish there had been pictures, but what I wanted I got, a book about one of the all time great sitcoms!"
5,Golden Girls,"As I have all the DVD's of the Golden Girls, I can now look up snippets from the shows that further make this series even more meaningful."
3,Bueno-pero demasiado viejo,"Me gusta el disco. Lo compre, porque tiene la cancion TODO TODO. Alguien me ha ensenado el baile de TODO TODO y queria la cancion que cabiera el baile. Pero el disco contiene demasiado canciones lentos. Lo siento, me gusta bailar."
1,ITEM SHIPPED WAS NOT SAME AS ADVERTISED,I was looking for a replacement for Ultima II CHR Lotion. The item received was a highly fragrenced lotion that was unuseable. My entire home smelled of the product and everyone in my home complained that it was too strong.
4,Really Great!,This is a great cd. Even for those of you who do not understand German - it's a lot of fun. Very pop oriented. I understand German on an intermediate level but it's a whole different story when it comes to understanding what's being said in song - so I only can pick out words here and there.Very good cd. Highly recommended if you want a taste of European/German music.
3,Helpful instruction for those new to yoga,"This is a very good DVD if you're new to yoga and would like to learn about some of the basic therapeutic poses. There is a list of each of the poses that you can pick in the menu, or just play them all. Desiree gives in explanation of each pose before showing it. For beginner's this is great, but was a bit boring for me. I was hoping for less camera talk and more practice. In most cases she shows beginner level, but for the thigh stretch on the floor, she goes to the extreme which I don't think is appropriate for beginner demonstration. You will however get some great tips and instruction that you don't get on other yoga DVD's.BTW, I think the other reviews prior to mine seem to be plugging this DVD ;o)"
2,Not what I was looking for,"If you're looking for a flowing work-out, this is not the DVD for you. This is actually a series of stretches with explanations for how each one works and is very disjointed. If you're accustomed to Vinyasa or Ashtanga yoga, you will be as disappointed as I was. There's no actual work-out, just the demonstration of stretches. Definitely not well suited for experienced yoga practioners."
4,Excellent for beginners or to target issues with your body,"I highly recommend this DVD if you are suffering from poor posture, back pain/strain, rotator cuff pain, carpal tunnel syndrome. This is not your typical 30 minute stretch or workout but a more thorough and targeted stretching and strengthening DVD. This is not a flowing yoga stretch routine, as you'd think or do at the local yoga center, but rather a segmented yoga stretch for specific body parts. The instructor breaks and opens a new segment for each new stretch and teaches why and how each stretch benefits your body. I've done it one time...ONE!...and already my lower back pain has relief. I'm also on my computer keyboard all day every day and there's instruction for wrist and arm stretches to relieve carpal tunnel."
3,"A stretching video, not a yoga video","I'm relatively new to yoga, practicing less than one year and found this to be an ok stretching video. The title indicates that it would be a soothing yoga practice but it is not. As other reviewers have stated, it's very choppy, there is no transition from pose to pose - at one point you're on the floor on a mat, blank screen, at the wall for an arm stretch, blank screen and then back at the mat, on the floor. Lots of standing, sitting, standing, laying, standing - not relaxing or restorative at all. Even I found some of the cues to be sort of weird - like the groin thing another reviewer mentioned - but I attributed that to my novice state. It's nothing I couldn't get past.That being said, if you want to get your stretch on, this might be a useful video for specific stretching and she does give some good intro pose modifications to help deepen your commitment to the poses. Desiree is pleasant enough, definitely lovely to watch."
4,Nice approach.,"Yoga to the Rescue, is like a collection of several moves and tips one ...should know. For the days you are not in the mood for a strong practice, but you would like to coach yourself. A good suggestion for teachers as well. There are important points that are not often brought to the surface, such as retaining the curves, or keep bringing life to painful ares. Desirée Rumbaugh sounds sometimes like advertising something, but I overcome it easily and I like her. Her body conveys the instructions in a very clear way."
5,Desiree Rumbaugh's Yoga to the Rescue DVD's,"I love Desiree Rumbaugh for all the reasons that come across when you watch her DVD. She cares about her students and puts a great deal of energy into finding the right balance in each pose between strength and flexibility - and the right mental balance between effort and softening/surrender in each pose. Carefully designed to work with the breath and in proper alignment, her yoga asanas and the exercises she has developed to help in yoga practice are clearly explained and demonstrated by both herself and her partner (who takes modified versions of the asanas). I suggest watching the DVD once through before trying to watch and practice at the same time. Her adjustments are sometimes subtle and her instructions are important, so it's worth taking the time with the DVD and with your practice. I highly recommend both ""feel good from head to toe"" and ""back pain."" These are excellent DVD's. Now go out and take a workshop in person from Desiree Rumbaugh as well!"
5,Good Season,Ghost Hunters had some lackluster seasons in the past but Season 7 was a good one. In particular I like Hill View Manor with Maddie the dog.
4,Crib bedding,The colors are wonderful and the items that came are very useful for my baby's things however the price was a bit high for my liking because the texture of the covers were not what I expected but still a good product.
5,"Fun, Bold, and Fabulous","This is so cute and very bold. The colors pop in the room which makes it very beautiful. I have been looking for a crib set that is fun and beautiful, not like those dull looking sets that are sold everywhere. And you can not beat the price. Most sets would cost the same price for maybe 3 or 4 pieces but here you get 9, a complete crib set. I know i sound like I'm doing advertisement for the company but trust I'm a real mother and consumer and I'm loving this...buy it, stop reading this and buy it, buy it now, you know you want to."
1,Cheap Fabric,"I ordered the Daisies Crib Bedding Collection and I am NOT satisfied. The quality of the fabric is beyond horrible and the set isn't able to be broken down into single parts. When I received the collection I thought it looked beautiful. But that was the end of it. It ""LOOKS"" beautiful. Once washed it looked like a rats nest. The wrinkles are unbelievable on the cheap fabric. I can't believe I spent over $100 on this set. If I could afford to mail it back, I would. I will be sure to tell all my mommy friends that JoJo Designs is a horrible product and to not purchase anything from you.MelisaDissatisfied Customer"
5,The Fourth Horseman,"Prior to the events of September 11, 2001, many Americans had a false sense of security regarding foreign attacks on U.S. soil. But in the post 9/11 world, we sadly realized our vulnerability and acknowledged the possibility of subsequent, similar attacks and the potential for equally as heinous attacks of a chemical or biological nature. It is this vulnerability to horrific acts committed by foreign agents living among us and blending into our society, that draws us into the fascinating story of Anton Dilger, an American-born doctor, beloved by his family and well respected in his community, who came to lead a secret life as a German spy and saboteur during World War I.This thought provoking and informative tale, with its blend of history, intrigue and espionage, will entertain the most ardent history buffs and WWI aficionados, as well as those simply looking for an entertaining and enjoyable change of pace book."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have to agree with the review below - there is nothing alternative about this guide. And the writer is so sarcastic about some of the places reviewed, that I wonder why they were in the book at all."
5,Great book,I use this every morning with my students and it is a great review with students who are below grade level. It covers every standard in that grade level and I like the pacing of the questions.
5,"Nedra Johnson's ""Testify"" is a MUST Buy Cd.","What can I say.. the woman's voice is amazing. Soulful and sexy, and will make you believe in true love all over again. Worth every penny. Might have to buy a few more to pass out as presents, as everyone should be listening to this woman sing her way into your very soul.Trish"
1,Ummm...,"To put it mildly, I'm mystified by the praise that Robert Bloch and Stephen King and Ray Bradbury lavish upon ""Fear"". Even on their worst days, those guys could (and did) write circles around a second stringer like L. Ron Hubbard. ""Fear"" would have worked reasonably well as a short story, but Hubbard pads his very thin concept with 100+ pages of silly, irrelevant booga-booga imagery pulled from thin air--and, by the time the denouement is revealed, the reader no longer cares.If you simply can't get enough Hubbard (I must confess that I've never met anyone who fits this description, but I'm sure rabid fans exist), you'll find ""Fear"" mildly interesting if only because it represents a departure from the author's usual space opera output. But if it's an engrossing tale of psychological horror you're after, avoid this book."
4,Great Horror By A Master of Sci-Fi,"This is the only Hubbard word I have ever read, and most likely the only one I'll ever read; but this is not because this book fell short of excellent! This is a wonderful forray out of his standard genre, sci-fi, and into horror. I read this after reading numerous recommendations of it as a classic by the likes of Stephen King and Robert Weinberg, and was not dissapointed I did. This is a classic that I found disturbing and un-put-downable for the first few chapters, and highlly satisfying by the end. Quite a premise: a man loses 3 hours of his life. There are hints that suggest he did something unthinkable during this time frame, so he must now search for what happened during this timeframe. His search takes him on a very memorable journey and what he finds is truly horrifying. This is not a particularly long book--it is said he wrote it on a train-ride from California to New York--but it is very much worth reading."
3,"Not my thing, but enjoyable enough","I'll keep this review simple and state that this type of book is not really my thing. It starts off normal enough, but then a Professor Lowry loses his job over an article and, after visiting a friend, loses his hat and four hours of his life. Following this, Lowry becomes obsessed by what happened to him in that time and in turn becomes haunted by ""things"" who warn him away from finding his hat and 4 hours. An interesting enough concept, and what follows is Lowry's slow decent into maddness.Without revealing too much, the ending of this book will make or break it for most people. At first I was annoyed by the ending, but thinking about it later it does make sense and fit, even if you weren't expecting it.All in all, it is a short, light read that does prove entertaining (if somewhat strange at times) and if this type of book is your thing, then you'll probably love it."
2,Good or Bad?,"I honestley cannot decide wether this was an incitefull story of a ""normal"" man's descent into madness or just a cheesy super- natural thriller that is especially hard to read."
5,What is going on here?,This book is like being a child again and fearing the unknown. It's excellent...it gets you thinking and sort of reminds me of (not to give anything away) but the family that inspired the Fuguitive movie and tv show. It has an ending that I cannot say. But if you do read it you will never forget it. In addition there is a small story that is nice at the end
2,nobody famous,I read this after reading the hype about it's fear factor and found it not at all scary but an OK story for its time.
3,Does not live up to its hype,"""Fear"" has been praised by people like Stephen King and Robert Bloch. It's been called a great, chilling horror novel. Personally, I didn't find it scary, but it did make me curious to know what had happened during the four missing hours. Unfortunately, once the mystery starts, the plot goes nowhere for the next half of the book until the ending. There are some rather good sequences towards the end, but the ending itself is more confusing than satisfying.2,5 for Fear. 3 stars for the Bridge Publications edition, which includes a pretty good short story called ""Borrowed Glory""."
2,Not THAT scary,"I, too, was swayed by the rave reviews from the likes of Stephen King and others. Hey, if he thought it was scary, maybe there was something to it.Yea, a couple parts were kind of eerie and shivery, but for the most part -- I had NO idea what was going on. It's like some weird Alice in Wonderland-type story -- and the ending is a surprise.For really scary stuff, stick to King."
4,"Fear good, not great","'Fear' is a good read, but far from the spine-tingler the reviews claim it is. I was left a little confused at the ending. I reread it twice but still couldn't quite understand what happened. The reader is left to guess."
1,The only scam is this book,"I had to give this book a one star rating because there was no way for me to rate it a zero.As stated in my review title, the only scam going on with canoes and kayaks in America is this book put out by Tim Ingram. To use a relevant cliché, Tim obviously has only one ore in the water. I can clearly understand the Mr. Ingram would like to see not one more person die in a paddling accident, however, I believe his claims and statements are motivated by the lack of industries willingness to integrate his products into their designs.The idea that the government is conspiring with the paddling industry to kill people is absurd.They all laughed at Professor Kaczynski until he started using the Post Office to send his messages, he's now known as the Unabomber. Let's hope Mr. Ingram doesn't start mailing these poor selling, gas-charged tubes."
4,Underground,"The first time i saw and heard looptroop was on a concert here in my country Sweden,and i was amazed,this is one of my favorite f***in cd's and i recommend that u buy this sh*t.One of the best hip hop groups i know i think.BUY IT!!!!"
5,This is so clever!!,"My cats learned to use the Kitty Kitchen in just a few of days. One rubs his face on the wheel; the other uses his paws. They love this toy. It's so cute to watch them help themselves to their treats!It appears to be a well made, sturdy toy. I recommend it to any cat owner."
4,Nice for the price,These speakers sound great for the price. Install was simple as all necessary hardware was included. Would recomend these highly.
4,Al is awesome as always,"This is an awesome DVD. I would have given it a 5 but I attended the concert live in Albuquerque and sat in row 1 so my expectations were a bit inflated. Nonetheless he brought back great memories of that night where I saw him live. If you're a Dimeola fan and don't have this DVD, you should add it to your collection without hesitation."
5,Exellent thru and thru...,"Miss Ruth brown was and still is the Queen of R&B. Of course these are not her classic Atlantic jump blues sides, and you can't compare this cd to her classic 50's songs like Mama He Treads Your Daughter Mean, and this Little girls Gone Rockin'. However listen to thsi cd for what it is, a great modern day blues cd, by a wonderful, still going strong singer. Brown doesn't squeel anymore, but she soes still posess a certian excitement and charm. I had the pleasure of seeing her live in Las Vegas in 2003, and she still rocks, and most of her audience was 20 somethings with pompadours and girls in poodle skirts. Brown really has a following with the rockabilly crowd, and listen to this cd and you'll see why it attacts us 20 somethings, and not just old fogies. A exellent 5 star worthy pure fun blues party cd, Brown is still in fine voice!"
4,Return to Old Stompin' Grounds,"I met Ruth at the Cotton Club in Washington, DC in 1956 or 58 at a very hard time in my life. I was a dancer and she had a voice that hushed the traffic on Benning Rd, NE! This lady brought a new strain of blues to the forum, best and most unique since Alberta Hunter. I reside in So. Calif and would give my new dental bridge to see her again (and meet her son). Thanks to Amazon for restoring a wonderful part of my live. Bev H"
3,"Good, But Not Her Best","This CD is okay, but Ruth doesn't shine on this CD as much as others. There are some really good tracks on this CD, but a few silly ones. However, I've listened to quite a bit of Ruth's music, so my opinion may be colored by my experience with other albums. Better CDs include ""Live in London"", ""Fine & Mellow"", and maybe even ""Blues on Broadway"". Ruth is one of the greatest female vocalists ever."
4,Real Good,"Ruth Brown is a Musical Pioneer&a true Legend.this Album finds her SOunding as strong as ever.Her voice is something special.She could ring circles around many of todays So-Called Singers.Artists Like Her,Etta James&A Small Handful are the Real when it comes to Soul."
2,Too narrow,"Wow, I thought my feet are wide. These shoes are very narrow and I am returning my pairs tomorrow."
3,"Nice, but...","I have bought them recently and wear for approx. 1 month already. Well, they're elegant and quite nice but for me personally a little bit narrow and the edges of my toes peep out of the side cuts. so for me it is quite hard and grievously to walk, besides the traces on my leg after taking them off look awful and hurt me. In general the quality is fine. Hope I will enlarge them as I proceed wearing."
4,Good Solid Release,"This is an excellent freshman release by any band; the three-part harmonies and beautifully blended vocals are a testament to the accuracy, talent, and devotion of these musicians. a good buy."
5,Awaiting the next release!,"Not Long After is a great high energy band. They did a live show where I live in Washington, and they play powerfully and have great talent. The songs on the CD are all great, melodic, and energetic. If you like punk with a bit of an emo catch here and there, you won't go wrong with this CD."
1,Pure Romance and Fiction,"This book is, at best, cr@p. Try not to read it. The protagonist, Wisner, and his cronies portray a ""high society"" crowd throwing dinner parties in which detailed policy was discussed among the elite, leading to actual policy and / or government action in later years, once they acquire requisite power to act. This is pure B.S., reflecting on past accomplishments through rose colored glasses. I admire the author for trying to take on the subject but please try to come at it from a slightly more objective perspective next time. Keegan's work on the world wars, Halberstam on Vietnam, among others are good examples of authors who spent years researching all possible angles and contributions to historical events. I could have ""made up"" a more credible story about the formation of the CIA."
2,disappointing,"I realize this was an open-air production of Madama Butterfly. However, I feel that the scenery could have been better. Being an outdoor production was no excuse for the awful costumes. Madama Butterfly looked more like a vampire than a geisha."
5,AWESOME Music,This is a must have for anyone who loves great music! It is beautiful and moving songs with catchy instrumentals! I highly recommend this CD.
5,Incredible band!,"I've followed the music of Ten point Ten since their beginning and this is their debut CD. The rich lyrics and harmonies make this one of my favorites! The angelic voice of Tara Park definitely makes this a ""must buy!"" This CD is only their debut... they keep getting better!"
3,Mannered Singing,"This is a somewhat disappointing recording. The cantatas are interesting, though not Handel in his full glory. The orchestral work is very good. The major problem is Kozena's singing. Despite her lovely voice, much of the vocal work in these pieces sounds artificial and even strained at times. I don't know if this is an effort to duplicate 18th century performance practices or simply to lend a dramatic flavor to the work. Regardless, it doesn't seem to work very well. This is surprising because Kozena's other recordings have shown that she is excellent singer with good artistic judgement."
3,"Not her best, but consistent with the rest of this series.","She has written much better books, but the quality was fairly consistent with the rest of the ""Texas"" series."
1,A Bad Ending To A Great Story Line,"I have all the other books in this series. I was thrilled when it came to my local bookstore. But I was VERY disappointed. All the other books in this series are believeable. I don't know why the author strayed from the formula, and gave her fans something totally off the wall. If I wanted science fiction, I watch the X-Files. The romance part between the heroine and the hero was great. But who would actually believe she came across time from the last century! Save it for Mulner and Scully!"
5,Fascinating,"I loved this book. It's pretty graphic in spots, but the messages she brings from her experiences in the afterlife had a profound effect on my thinking. I feel I'm a better person for having read this."
2,Unusual,"Not a book I would personally recommend. The author had a difficult situation, but I didn't feel inspired after reading the book. This surprised me, because I am a deeply spiritual person. I thought the author was indulgent and the book was sad and depressing. It was certainly an example of what not to do."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,THIS BOOK WAS TRULY INSPIRING! MS. WALLACE'S STORY IS A MUST READ! SHE WENT THROUGH A TOUGH ORDEAL AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT! HER NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE AND HER TRIALS AFTER ENDURING BEING BURNED ARE EXTRAORDINARY! I HONESTLY LOVED THIS BOOK AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE WAY IT WAS WRITTEN! A MUST READ!!!!
4,Talisman,"In evil, in all darkness and hell, there is a Talisman. The one who posseses this Talisman is immortalized by it, made the master of the Earth. When an 18 year old boy goes in search of his sister who was addopted after their parents die, he lands in a home for rich, delinquent kids. He figures out his sister is the evil owner's adopted daughter and she is the owner of the Talisman. Full Moon did a great job with this movie. It will terrify you through and through."
5,Actor is great,"I have to say Billy Parish is a fantastic actor, but I am partial. I know him. However, I feel this is a good movie to watch. It is not a blockbuster, but it has a good story of a brother and sister torn apart by a legend. It has many good qualities of acting and breaking out to be noticed, finally. The Power Ranger actor supported Billy in his role. Great! Watch it!"
2,One professor's take,"I used this for a Ph.D. level course in Leadership Studies and can honestly say that, in almost three full decades of teaching, it was the worst mistake I have made in picking a textbook. Besides the above comment that it is low in definitional accuracy, it is just self-indulgent beyond words. I had the picture of a puppy bringing me a chewed newspaper and waiting to get petted for doing so. The author goes to great pains to demonstrate how bright he is, while demonstrating that his ""brightness"" is in the manipulation of words and other tools, not in understanding what he is talking about or in helping others to understand what he thinks he is saying.Unless you like ""buzz words"" and jargon and the good feeling that comes from superficiality, stay away from this one."
1,Not up to expectations,"I could not get the essence of this book. There is not a coherent framework, nor ideas are applied in a way that I would find useful. Please try to peruse a copy before purchasing it - in my case it would not make my first cut through the ""search inside"" feature."
1,Horrible book!,"Okay, let me first say this book is crap! I am a senior in college and have had a 4.0 the entire time and all of a sudden get stuck with having to read this book in one of my business classes. Firstly, this book is extremely confusing to the point where it makes your mind spin and when you get done reading a page you forget everything you read because you were sitting there trying to comprehend what the author was saying. Like several other people have reviewed, it seems as though the author loathes in seeing how confusing he can make sentences, ideas, and theories to the reader instead of making the points clear and understandable. I have read the first two chapters and do not remember hardly anything because of me having to reread some sentences up to ten times; I think I am going to use this book as toilet paper because it is not worth a plug nickel."
4,Managing Chaos and Complexity: A Platform for Designing Business Architecture,My company recommended that I read this book in advance of training session with the author. I scanned the entire book today. Some useful info.
1,DON'T BUY!!!,"This cd contains a virus on it! ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY! It will put a virus on your computer. And even if you do not put it in your computer, it won't play. It doesn't have any music on it. SERIOUSLY, don't buy."
1,NOT a Travelogue....,"which is what I wanted! It's actually a music video shot in three cities - Hong Kong, Bali and New York City - mostly at night. Shows fashion shows, clubbing (with the emphasis on young females), street scenes and city skylines(beautiful). Not what I was looking for or am interested in. Found the music obnoxious but that's probably because I'm a ""woman of a certain age""! Young people would probably find it all very exciting."
2,Two stars,"I can't quite share the inflated praise of most of the readers here, because Torres' lines, while authentic-sounding aren't that great, but it's interesting."
2,Not the best we've seen from Tinto; over priced and over rated,"Much is left to the imagination and I found it to be rather long and too much dialogue. The erotic scenes, while frequent, were brief and not as intense as hoped. We continued to see the same woman over and over. This is not the best film I have seen from Tinto Brass. A more interesting production would be ""Cheeky""."
1,This DVD has been butchered,"I have seen the Italian version. This version simply stinks: too many scenes have been removed. Who ever did this should be arrested. This is a great film; so why not leave it alone? And dubbing it in English takes away the very charm that Italian brings to it. The folks who did this obviously have no appreciation for art....Now, for the Italian version, it is worth learning Italian."
3,All Ladies Do It,"The unfortunate fact is that this DVD is the UK edited version of the original Italian ""Cosi Fan Tutti."" I have seen both versions and suggest that you get the unedited Italian DVD and a multi-system DVD player to see the movie as it was meant to be seen.Since I first posted this reveiw, I've heard that the distributor plans to issue the unedited version of ""Cosi Fan Tutti"" in the future. If that proves to be true, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying that version."
1,BORING!,"To say the least, the first story by Cathy Maxwell wasn't bad but also not her best. My first view of Liz Carlyle makes me just mad at the publishing house for printing something and putting a price tag on it when it should have gone straight to the garbage. Her sentence structure was and ""A"" but I didn't buy a book to see how well the writing was but how good the story was. I don't usually put much into posting here but this story stunk so bad I had to. The supposed hero says ""Oh God"" so often which I find offensive but after a while thought perhaps Mz Carlyle was torn between fiction something and inspirational. So many good story tellers get rejected and this we spend good money on. In a word this book was Boring!"
5,Excellent,"Auguste is mute, an orphan and an outcast in a small French village, until an aged, retired master teaches him the art of mime. Auguste learns to express himself through mime, and the other children are attracted to his natural talent, but the adults are still cruel to him. This is a sweet, tender story, very sentimental but effective and touching.There are two sequels to this book, Far in the Day and The Silent Voice."
5,Hebrew Student's Albatross,What a great resource. This great tool is a Hebrew Bible word list in various forms. It is the book that gives me fits because there's always a vocabulary quiz coming out of it every day for class.
1,Damaged,"3 times I returned this product and each time they sent a replacement it was damaged. The spine was pulling away from the binding. It makes me wonder if Amazon offers such low prices on books because they are ""seconds."""
4,Overall a good resource,This is a great resource to practice and learn Hebrew vocabulary. However it would be nice if the numbered words matched the vocabulary flash cards by the same authors.
4,Fan of Matthew Ward,"Having enjoyed the music of the 2nd Chapter of Acts for a long time, I think Matthew Ward is a special talent in Christian music. I enjoyed also his work with Dennis Jernigan. The mix of new songs (at least to me) and some songs I was familiar with, makes this a very nice listen. I recommend it."
3,Global Govt?,"Not entirely sure a global governing body would work, many emperors have shed much blood and treasure in many failed attempts to do just that. As a fictional story it's actually quite good, and minus the dates it's quite accurate"
3,Didnt finish it,"Very boring start, and very hard to get into. Wont buy it again, and don't recommend it to the average reader."
3,Good work,Generally I'd say that the author is a dreamer - with a good dose of reality to be learnt from.
2,Couldn't finish it,"I've enjoyed other stuff by this author before, but man oh man, this thing just bored the heck out of me. I couldn't finish it. Still, got it for free on my Kindle, so I can't really complain."
1,WOW,"How quickly do you want him to come!!! My complete family for 3 generations plus are in masons or eastern star. make sure you know what you're getting into, because if you do join, don't even think about getting out."
1,Not That Good,"Even good writers produce a turkey or two. This is definitely Well's gobbler. I thought he was going in the right direction when he did some character development in a couple of places; it started to get interesting, but then he lapsed back into post-atomic war preaching mode. His model for world government by a single body is pretty lame, but he came close to describing what an atomic bombing and the aftermath would be like. His description of unlimited energy from fission was completely off the mark, however. Altogether, it got pretty darn tedious after awhile."
3,"Grapes not fit for wine, but ok on the table","An ok book by the ""don"" of Canadien hockey. He tells some wonderful stories, but not enough of them. The worst part about the book is that he skips around a lot. His thoughts seem disjointed and he tends to not tie things together at times."
4,"Don rules, but I've read better books","For a hockey read, this is pretty good. However, for a truly 5-star book, ""Thin Ice - A Season in Hell with the New York Rangers"" truly puts this one to shame. Although I love Don Cherry, after reading this book, I have to admit that when I was finished with it, I came to the conclusion that alot of the problems that he's incurred in his life seem to be self-inflicted. . yet he seems to want to possibly deflect them off as being always the blame of someone else. In alot of the cases that's true, but in some instances, I cant agree. I will say this though, after reading his book, I can understand Don's devotion to his past wife Rose; she truly must have been a wonderful person."
5,Great Millennium CD,"This CD by the Millennium is now better than ever! I bought AllTime Greatest Hits by Lynyrd Skynyrd because I thought I'd likeit, but didn't really like it, because it had Simple Man, andother weak songs. This CD is way better. Greater songs even FreeBird is on here. Sweet Home Alabama, What's Your Name, Gimme Three Steps, That Smell, and Freebird are my 5 favorite trackson this album Great CD."
4,Great cd,"Great cd with the classics/genius/masterpiecesfree bird,sweet home alabama,that smell,what's your name,and gimme three stepseverything else just isn't goodive never heard a band with great great songs have so much throw-awaysi don't knowmaybe i bought the wrong cd but this one is worth the classics mentioned above"
4,Uhh... No,"Well, despite the fact that there are 10 good songs on this cd I find it hard to reccommend it. Not that the songs aren't good, they are, but this cd is just far from complete. You simply can't fit all of Skynyrd's best songs onto one cd. It's impossible. If you are only a very casual fan, say you heard Sweet Home Alabama or Freebird on the radio and liked them, and don't wanna spend a lot of money on a band you're not sure if you're gonna like or not, then I guess this is for you. However, if you want the definitive Lynyrd Skynyrd retrospective get The Essential."
4,Too Much is Missing,"There is so much better Skynyrd out there. Free Bird, Sweet Home Alabama, That Smell, What's your name are here, but where's Tuesday's Gone? This is an ok collection, it does have Free Bird, the anthem, the best guitar solo ever recorded. The solo on Stairway to Heaven can't touch this one."
3,Good Album but Missing Too Much,"Though this is a very good disc, it leaves out too much to be considered the ""Best of Lynyrd Skynyrd"". Tracks missing include: Tuesday's Gone, Give Me Back My Bullet, The Ballad of Curtis Lowe, Call Me the Breeze, and Simple Man. If you want a true greatest hits go with another album."
3,Good Starter,"This cd is good is you haven't listened to Skynyrd before. It has Free Bird (the best guitar anthem ever in my opinion) Sweet Home Alabama, That Smell, etc. But it doesn't have good songs like Tuesday's Gone or The Ballad of Curtis Lowe. So if you wanna get the best Skynyrd get The Essential Lynyrd Skynyrd which is a double disc. It has everything that is on this cd plus 17 others such as Tuesday's Gone, The Ballad of Curtis Lowe, and Free Bird Live which is pretty cool if you haven't see them in concert and it's still good even if you have (I have). So that's a better buy than this. This is still a good cd if you're just getting into Lynyrd Skynyrd though. If all you want are Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird, then get this cd but it's missing some good songs."
3,Not the best ten songs,"Ten songs is not a lot to cover Lynyrd Skynyrd, and obviously it will leave something out, but these ten songs aren't even their ten best in my opinion. How can it claim to be a ""best of"" and not even have one their most famous songs: Simple Man? Here are the ten tracks that I would have chosen:1.Sweet Home Alabama2.Simple Man3.Gimme Three Steps4.Double Trouble5.Comin' Home6.Saturday Night Special7.That Smell8.Ballad of Curtis Loew9.I Ain't the One10. Free Bird"
2,Great presentation... weak coffee,The Bodum 3000 Santos is really unique looking... I've wanted one for years and they have finally got to a reasonable price in my opinion. The instuructions are needed to get you started and after a few times... you'll have it down. The controls are very small... but they work well! The presentation of the coffee brewing is just enjoyable to watch (my boys just love it!) The temperature of the coffee is good and hot... But here is why i sent the Bodum back... weak coffee. I could not believe it. Ive tried many things to get a strong cup from this bodum... but when I put 14 scoops of medium/fine ground coffee in the machine and the coffee is still mild... i realized i would be spending a lot more on coffee than i wanted in a year.
2,Everything's not in order!,"This is the only Prima book that I have that is unhelpful. The game is already hard. Why couldn't they give more detail and put things in order.The masks, pieces of heart, ans everything else are not in order the way you're suppose to get them in the game.Conclusion: The Brady Games guide is much more helpful than this [...]."
2,"Lots and lots of substance, no organization whatsoever.","This gudie begins with the game's instructions, then a descriptive and well-written outline is presented. That is the plateau of what could have been a great strategy guide. Then, it just lists a bunch of information, some relating to what you have to do, some not. I do not think that the author wanted to bother organizing any of the information in order. To find out what to do next, you are constantly flipping the pages. I would not recommend this book under any circumstances. I would try the guide by brady games. The reason I did not give this guide a 1-star rating is because its packed full of information. It can be useful if you know what your looking for."
1,Nothing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first got this book, I was very disappointed. It made alot of picture errors, where they paste the picture in the wrong place. They made things more complicated than before. I was stuck in Stone Tower for 3 months because I couldn't figure out how to flip it upside down. I have only one word; IT STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,lots of freedom,The Legend of Zelda Majora's mask Prima's official stratagie giude is a great giude for any gamer who is stuck on some thing but doesn't want it to tell him exacly how to do it. It even seels up the last part of the game with the final boss and spider dungens. If you are a gamer who hates to think then you might want a diffrent giude but i doute that because Zelda is thewrong game for some one like that.
3,The typos,"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask: Prima's Official Strategy GuideThis book has a lot of typos. For a professional game guide they should have worked out the bugs before they sold it in 2000. I noticed something wrong when I forgot how to play the song of elegy of emptiness, prima printed it as the new wave boss nova song... and I had no idea why it wasn't working because it was titled the elegy of emptiness. You dun goofed Prima. Anyway go a head and get it for 5 bucks or less other wise just look this stuff up online!"
2,Confusing and not well written,"First off, DO NOT BUY THIS!! This book may help you get the masks, but not only are there mistakes in the book (as to where the fairys are) but the directions are confusing. Buy the official guide from Nintendo. Prima's player guide gives confusing directions and is a pain to decipher, I had to collect all the fairys from one of the temples because the book missed the location of one of the fairys. Using the guide to help me complete the water temple was a pain! It gave confusing directions by telling you to go North or South, East or West, and that is very difficult especially when you are located in a temple. I suggest that you buy the Nintendo guide instead of this. Nintendo gives specific directions (such as leave through the red door, etc) and is detailed with accurate maps and such. Don't buy this guide, it doesn't help you very much, and you may as well try to complete the game without the help of this book at all its so confusing and badly written."
3,"Ok, but not PERFECT","This book is not a must have or anything like that, its just ok. This guide may give you all the secrets, skultilas, heart pieces, masks and dungeon hints but it does not give you this info in order. It just scrambles it all throughout the guide and it is incredably confusing to find what your looking for. The maps are not detailed enough and are not large enough to see the little amount of detail they did put in. For future reference I recomend THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S MASK THE OFFICIAL PERFECT GUIDE and other PERFECT GUIDES to different 64 games. Hope you decided to go my way but if you didn't at least look and the guide I recomended."
4,A Nice Introduction To BJH,"This album is a reissue of BJH's John Lees & Wooly Wolstenholme's 1999 Nexus CD with a new name. Stand-out tracks include: Star Bright, Brave New World and the evergreen Mockingbird. If you don't own Nexus & Revival (Live), the CD can be a good introduction to BJH (John Lees) songs."
3,This took me by surprise!!,"I came in with low expectations for this movie and came away pleasantly surprised. Very good and consistent storyline. Clark Johnson was, as always, a delight to see."
2,"Almost a good kite, needs strong winds to fly","I love parafoil kites, they are great to have stuffed in a bag. They don't break when they crash (unless you tangle them in a tree). This one flys, but it needs a strong wind to do so since the line is heavy compared to the lifting power of this kite. It was fun to fly with my niece, but also frustrating since it was difficult to keep in the air without strong winds.This is far from the worst small kite I've seen, it does fly, but I think going with a slightly larger parafoil might be better (or maybe lighter kite line?).It has pretty nice tails."
5,COLORful,"This cd is a real treat. Chris Cann sings along the same genre as LIVE or CREED. Great beats, very sing-a-long-able."
4,Great Stuff,I received a couple complementary jars of this product while staying at the Cheeca Lodge in Islamorada (Florida Keys). I have used a shea butter cream from Bath & Body Works and like the results but hated the greasiness. This product provides the same results but without the grease. I'm switching for sure!
1,I was disappointed in the portion I consulted; it was biased,"I read the portion on the legalization of drugs where the author's bias in favor of legalization could not be more clear. Nor are the selections he has chosen to feature good representations of their positions. I recommend that in future editions he cite William Bennett or James Q. Wilson for the anti-legalization side or some research from the Family Research Council. William F. Buckley is better on pro-legalization. If the author's bias governs his choices as strongly in the other issues featured in the book, this would not be a good choice for having students look at good arguments on opposing sides."
4,Un gran disco,"Este disco de Camilo Sesto evidentemente no podra igualar los tiempos de Gloria de Camilo en los setentas u ochentas pues su voz ha cambiado, es mas gruesa, pero aun tiene la calidad que Camilo siempre ha tenido.Estoy de acuerdo con el comentario anterior en el sentido de que su voz esta mucho mejor que en los dos discos anteriores.Desde mi punto de vista ninguna cancion tiene desperdicio y si las canciones del fantasma de la opera tienen un acento de alguien que habla español eso no sera importante para los escuchas de habla hispana.De acuerdo en que Isabel Patton no es la mejor para cantar con Camilo el fatasma, ojala que hiciera nuevas versiones con alguien mas."
3,Prefiero las canciones romanticas de el en espanol,"Es verdad que la voz de Camilo no tiene la misma fuerza que antes. Su voz no ""vibra"" como antes pero los sentimientos de amor en las canciones en espanol son, a mi parecer, mas desarrollados que antes. Tuve que pensar mas en lo que, tal vez, sentia el cuando las escribio. De todos modos, como Camilo tiene casi 60 anos, y tuvo un transplante de higado, me encanta que decidio seguir cantando."
1,All you have to do is listen to the samples...,"Phantom fans, if you have stumbled across this, be WARNED! If for some reason you have not been able to have your ears 'graced with the melodious tones' of this man's Phantom of the Opera renditions...consider yourself the luckiest person on earth!If you want to cringe, listen to the 'wonderful' samples. As the person before me put it, it's like 'waiting for a rubber band to snap in your face,' the faces you will be forced to make just from the SAMPLES! How terrible!!To fans of Senor Sesto, my apologies.To fans of good music, heed the warning!"
2,yuck!,"OK, even Ozzy Osbourn loses his accent when he sings,this man does not! That is fine with his other tracks, but he is trying to sing Phantom, too!This is what we all feared with Phantonio! Think Che' in Evita, please!I do have to apologize to any fans, but please, for the love of Michael Crawford, do not listen to the POTO tracks!"
1,Rebel Without A Clue,"So, Mr. Ford is ousted from one temple after another for his refusal to give up his porn gossip website. As it should be. Ford wants to be an Orthodox Jew (probably because in the religion he finds reinforcement for his misogyny and bigotry)and the religious code he embraces forbids this. Where's the drama in that? It's not as if Ford is challenging the religious code. He simply wants to have it both ways, like a petulant child.If Ford were half the writer/journalist he thinks he is he could easily have turned his back on porn gossip and started writing on any number of subjects and the rabbis would have smiled upon him. But he found a niche for his monosyllabic style of writing on the Internet, where the demand for stylized, intelligent writing is very low indeed.This is the story of a stubborn, untalented, vainglorious man and it's a self-published book to boot. Doesn't that say it all?"
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed in this movie. It must have been one of Cheryl Ladd's very first movies. Cheryl Ladd is one of my favoriate actresses but I was disappointed in her performance though she was the best of the lot and the quality of the film was poor. Story line predictable.
1,"Not sure if it is, but it should be rated R","My wife is a very devoted fan of Danielle Steele. There have been very few of her works that my wife has been disappointed (such as Family Album). As for the movies, Now and Forever is the one movie she absolutely does not want (along with Family Album). I have watched it with her and have to agree with her. The movie is way too intense for one of Danielle Steel's typical movies. I am not sure if it is rated 'R', but it definitely should be. The sex scene may not have any nudity, but the intenseness of the intercourse deserves the 'R' rating. The acting throughout the movie is subpar at best. Cheryl Ladd could not rescue this movie and should have never agreed to do it in the first place. Collect the other Danielle Steel movies, but I would recommend passing on this one."
4,Danielle Steel's Now & Forever,"A good story line and Cheryl Ladd is, as always, magic in this movie. She is a strong, loving wife who has been betrayed by her husband but she stands by him regardless and in the end love prevails. Great entertainment!"
5,DVD Review,Danielle Steel's Movies are awesome!! I brought this one because I did not have this one in my collection.I would like to buy more DVDs from this series
3,Now and Forever dvd,"Nothing wrong with the product I was very pleased with everything I just didn't like the movie much, but it is an addition to my collection which I need, so yes very pleased."
3,disappointed,"not as good as other films i have of danielle steels, but because i loveall her books and films i bought it,but the way the film was made it did not seem to ring true.norma east"
5,Great book,"Warren Wiersbe masterfully chornicles the lives of the great preachers of the last 200 plus years. The brief bios are heartwarming. However, the real secret to getting the most of this work is Wiersbe lists the best books of and by each subject. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but most of all you will be changed as you ""live with the giants."" Note -- he cronicles some of the lessor known men and leaves off some of the ones you would think would be included, i.e., Martin Lloyd-Jones, Clovis Chappell, etc."
3,Here Comes Bam Again,"Overall this was a decent Bam Flick. It had its slow points, but if you enjoy the antics of his crew, you will enjoy this movie."
2,"That's not James Dean, that's Michael Brandon!!","If you read the fine print (by enlarging the image) on the front of themovie's cover, you'll see that the real James Dean isn't actually in thismovie. It says ""Michael Brandon"" is James Dean! Oh really?What kills me is that in the product information it says that James Dean is starring in this movie (or one of them). That's a clerical error by some numbskull who couldn't care less and wouldn't know James Dean fromMartin Sheen! Some young pup born yesterday working on the product description, no doubt! But don't you fall for it!Of course, if you want to see another actor pretending to be James Dean, that's your call."
5,This book is loaded with the history of Toyota.,"This book will open your eyes to the unique story of men and machines in Japan, USA and Europe. There are also accurate accounts of the history of the automotive industry in the early days. You will come to realize a new appreciation for the honor and ethics of the Toyoda family and the companies and systems they founded and developed."
5,I thought the book was a facinating read,"I thought the book was as informative as interesting. I learned a lot about Toyota, and management in general. More impressive was the writing I could not put this book down. It was exiting from start to finish."
4,OK,"Handy little product for those who have a need for such a thing. Not fully a microscope (too small, no light source) and not fully a scope (again, too small) but perfect for lightweight camping/hiking. However, you will have to make a case for it because none is supplied (a cloth bag would have been nice). Instructions for usage are inadequate."
4,THE REGINA PIERCE AFFAIR,A INTERESTING B MOVIE. GOOD LOOKING BABES AND THEY EVEN TRY TO HAVE A DECENT PLOT. IF YOU CAN GET IT FOR CHEAP (UNDER $5.00) THEN DO IT. MIKE JACOBSEN 9-12-2009
2,Disappointing,"I've had some luck with Clean & Clear products so I had no qualms picking up the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser from the store. However, as soon as I used it I became a bit frustrated.To begin with,the formula is very watery and thin. I prefer something a little thicker and this didn't feel like it stayed on my skin long enough to do a very good job. While it might have helped with acne a little, it definitely does not live up to its name.I also felt that it made my skin more oily and I quickly stopped using it to switch to a different product. Over the course of the day, my skin would become uncomfortably oily. Where is the continuous control in that?Clean & Clear's Continuous Control Acne cleanser sat in my shower for quite some time before I finally picked it up again, a sure sign that this product was no doing its job adequately.There are definitely other acne products, some even from Clean & clear, that I prefer of the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser."
4,One of the best OTC acne treatments,"I have been using this cleanser since my late teens. It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available, and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena. When used twice a day, the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get. Also, it contains menthol, so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin (but do not get it into your eyes; it burns like the flames of he11!). There are only two drawbacks to this product: 1) It will dry out your skin, so wear a lotion and 2) The active ingredient, benzoyl peroxide, is a bleaching agent, so it will bleach fabric. I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes."
4,Great product,Used this during the time period up to my wedding. I dont have super oily skin or tons of breakouts. this worked great as powerful everyday wash
5,Awsome Product!!!,I have tried everything to control my acne and this product is the best by far. It dosen't dry out my skin and clears any acne I have within a couple of days. I've tried many different washes and this is the best! Better than proactiv!!
2,not working,"so far, 3 kids (18, 16 and 13) have had no results with this. The boys may be a little challenged on washing with it twice a day and have more severe acne than the 13yo but I'm very disappointed that it has not helped them at all."
4,GOOD results but excessive drieness,"I fell in love with Benzoyl Peroxide since it clears and prevents further break outs,One downfall of this is that it cause dryness more than other acne treatments."
2,Works great but....,"I absolutely love this product. it doesn't dry my skin like it did to other reviewers. but, after about two weeks of using the product, i noticed the expiration date. It expired in 2005. that was SEVEN years ago. (It is Dec 2012 now)."
3,Fine,"It is cool when using it for cleaning, but I'm allergic to this product. Be careful if you also want to use it."
4,"Squeaky Clean, but Non-Drying!","Coming from someone who has struggled with bacne forever, this product was surprisingly good! I've used Pro-activ, Murad, Neutogena, Oxy, you name it. I've done everything, but I found that this worked really, really well and didn't leave me over-dry.I still get pimples on my back / chest, but I have noticed a substantial difference since using this (and I've been using it for the last two years). Considering the amount of time I've spent with other products (all of which are super expensive, don't do anything, leave me over-dry or super greasy), I'm thankful to have found something that's relatively cheap and does the trick in keeping things manageable."
4,Awesome,"Left this on longer than the 30 seconds and felt I had better results. It's a great cleanser, although it stings a bit. I think the fact that this cleanser has menthol makes it great, as menthol is known to reduce acne inflammation. It didn't get rid of acne but it definitely helped reduce outbreaks."
4,"a bit harsh, but works","I found that this cleanser has like the highest amount of benzoyl peroxide out of any of the other facial washes but it really does the trick. It has been the only one to really work well for me.. just be careful like the other reviews say - this WILL bleach things.. towels, pillowcases, the bathroom rug lol be careful!"
2,not really,"I used this a while ago, it didn't really clear any acne whatsoeverit wasn't very drying though. it smelled not so great too. its not horrible but it didn't clear any of my acne"
2,a wanna be Wild On T.V. show,"Although this dvd was suppose to depict what the scene is all about, it never hit me inside. I felt as if I just purchased a Brooke Burke rip off! There really isn't a soundtrack (which would have been real cool) It was drowned out by a half dozen narrators trying to get their three seconds of fame. Alot of rambling about who was there, celeberty wise, and no feeling of the music and vibe. The Ibiza half of the movie was alittle better, but still too much talking. I recomend whoever makes more of these films to let the music and the people at these parties tell the story. Hard to turn on the surround sound , and have the dj pump through the speakers, when the narrators are screaming about how pretty they look. Peace!!! PLUR"
3,disappointed,I wasn't too impressed with this DVD. There was just too much one-on-one interviews with the crew and not enough footage of the pimp-n-hoe party and ibiza. I don't know why they couldn't do their commentary over the party scenes. The bonus CD has all the songs on the DVD and they're pretty good.
3,World Party: not too bad,"i have other dance music dvds and obviously i'm comparing this dvd to the others i have, my fav being ""Girls in Ibiza: Wild and Uncensored""... in comparison this dvd is a bit bland but definitely worth the $4 or $5 i paid for it... if i had my way, all my dvds would be compilations of dance music events... so all-n-all, taking into consideration what i paid for it, i give it a thumbs up"
3,Bearings For Inline Skates or Skateboards?,"I bought a box of Bones Swiss Labyrinth Skate Bearings and I would love to review them. Unfortunately, when I ordered them, I was under the mistaken impression that they were for Skateboarding. Upon receiving them, I immediately started removing my old bearings. This is when I discovered that they were made for inline skates. Aargh! I'm hoping that I will be successful when I offer to trade them for Bones Swiss Labyrinth Skateboard Bearings at a local skate shop. If/When I do so, I will return with an informed and informative review. Thanks!"
5,The Big Book o'Beer,This is a very fun and educational book for beer lovers. Lots of info and great photos/illustrations.
5,"Great book, great writer.","An outstanding, and often funny, book by one of my favorite authors. If you liked this one, check out some of his other books.Seriously, one of the best young writers of this generation. And I'm not just saying this because of the great brew in my hand."
1,BOOTLEG,"This is a BOOTLEG. NO such official item was ever released. The only official fruit release is MELON released in a CARDSLEEVE Cd and 12"" Vinyl."
4,Great for a game show study!,I was trying out for a game show and was looking for some books to study from and wished this one had arrived in time for the test. It's perfect reading material for people who want to fill their brain with trivia!
4,Great gift for my nephew!,"My 10 yr old nephew asked for this for Christmas and he loved it! After all of the excitement of opening gifts was over and the adults were talking and preparing food, he had something to keep him happy for hours. He has many different lego sets and loves them all. It is amazing how he can read the instructions and build these wonderful toys and then have hours of fun playing with them. Listen, what better way to train a man to read the instructions at an early age? Some lucky lady will be thankful for that later on!"
3,Oz,Quality is OK seeing as how the movies are so very old. I had seen one on TV and it was not as dark and easier to see.
1,Don't get it,If you like old fashion movies this is for you but it really isn't that good in my opinon this was a waste of money.
3,Quality lacking,"This is obviously a very old movie. It is a silent film and appears to not have been digitally remastered. It is interesting from an antiquity point of view. 1916 is along way back in time for movie technology. If you keep in mind the age and the acting style from then, you may enjoy this. There are 3 movies on it, I believe. They are short. I only watched one and I think it was only about 45 minutes long. Don't try to compare it to the 1939 version that we all know and love. These versions are vastly different from each other, and the comparison doesn't make any sense."
4,Must-have for Oz book-fans; horrible new score,"I was so happy to finally be able to see Baum's original movies. They're odd and incomprehensible if you haven't read the books, or sometimes even if you have. But so much fun for their historical interest. The character cameos were fun, especially seeing the Braided Man as a juror in Ojo's trial. The animal puppetry was amazing, and the sets and costumes were so much like the book illustrations.But the musical score was awful; the same fifteen seconds of ""music"" repeated over and over, until we turned off the sound because we couldn't stand any more. It was slow and lugubrious and had nothing to do with the hilarious action."
4,Amazing look back,"This DVD is an amazing display of L Frank Baum's film work. If you are fan of old silent movies or a fan of the world of OZ, this dvd is a must have."
5,Good Grief! So Good!,"Recently played in a pit orchestra for this show and needed the recording for reference purposes. Didn't realize that I'd still be listening to it. Usually on a Broadway musical soundtrack there are two or three tracks that I tend to skip over, but there were none on this recording! The music was as I remembered it from the old movie cartoon. Kristin Chenoweth is brilliant in ""My New Philosophy,"" ""Beethoven Day"" is a great upbeat addition, and ""Suppertime"" is a showstopper even on a CD. Even the bow music is fun. What makes it even greater is that it's only the six or so musicians playing- what talent. It's a treat. Really fun."
5,Awesome sounds from an apparent awesome show!,"This c.d. is great! I laugh myself silly whenever I hear the songs, and I think of how easy and affective it would be to perform it! You would be getting a fun c.d. if you purchased this one."
5,i could see the colorful settings,"I bought this CD to practice for my part in my middle schools version of ""YAGMCB"" in which i play Linus. I also purchased the 1967 version and, in comparison, the '67 version sounds more like ""It's your Funeral, Charlie Brown."" Not that it was very bad, but it lacked the excitement that this one most definately has. The cast of this one was very enthusiastic about it. They sounded, like a bunch of very talented kids. Through hearing their singing and seeing the pictures of the characters, as I listened to the songs, I could actually see them being performed in my head. I could see the bright, colorful settings, and the characters interacting in front of them. All in all, this CD is definately worth getting, for fans of ""Good ol' Charlie Brown"" as well as fans of the Musical Theatre."
4,"Fun, fun, fun!","What a joy this show was, and what a shame that it closed early! Would that the entire cast had gotten Tony awards for a wonderful ensemble effort. Kristen Chenoweth probably has many more Tonys in her after this breakout performance.This cast recording is excellent, and is of far better quality than my beloved, long out-of-print original cast LP. Why only four stars, you ask? Well, the opening is muddled (why didn't they stick to the stage version, with the separate lines, instead of overlapping them), and Ilana Levine's wonderful turn on ""Schroeder"" (with the sultriest pronunciation of ""Freres Jacques"" you'll ever hear) comes across considerably less powerfully on the recording than on stage. Finally, Chenoweth's monologues should certainly have been a part of this album. If you haven't actually seen this production, then you probably wouldn't notice, but these minor things bugged me a bit. Don't get me wrong, though: this album is superb."
5,THE BEST C.D. EVER,This cast and sound track RULES. My personal favorites in Kristin Chenoweth's My New Philosophy. Kristin Chenoweth RULES! Buy the C.D. or you'll regret it!
5,The Best Broadway Album of the 98-99 Season,"Ok, fisrt of all i saw the show twice on broadway, i bought it the first day it came out, and i followed them in the news like nothing else, but anyway. About the album, it is the most fun, liveliest, up beat, album that has ever come off of the stage. It brings a smile to my face everytime i listen to, and it makes me want to belt out all he words. And then when i think about how it closed, i know i will always have the cast album to remind me of it. The pictures with the cast and autographs help too."
3,A Non Compairing Review From Lucy,"Having rcentley been labled a know it all on Musicals.net, I am writing a new, non compairing review of this CD. I will not mention the production I was in once.And it will not be a novel. In fact, all my opinions will be stated in short, if not incompliete sentences. Great new orchestrations. Anthony Rapp is all but perfect. Ilana Levine is the most annoying Lucy ever. Roger Bart is perfectly cast and deserved his Tony. Stanley Wayne Mathis is very enthusiastic and very loud. B. D. Wong is perfectly cast, I love his lisp, and I can't believe he's the same guy as in Mulan. Kristen Chenoweth also definatly diserved her Tony. I wish I had the original cast, but this is very much acceptable."
3,mediocre,"Nothing to fancy-shmancy, but fun to listen to. Being the only recording of the show, you don't have many other choices...."
1,Prefer the Original! A musical should be pleasant to hear.,"I was not expecting the Broadway version to be so 'Broadway'. I would like a copy of the Original cast. If it is released again let me know. If this were not already a classic, maybe the irritating changes would not have been so disappointing. It is hard to enjoy the humor within 'Little Known Facts' when the singer is intentionally trying to sound irritating. (That used to be one of my favorite songs on the CD.) Listen to that song or 'Shroeder' before buying the CD. If you find it too irritating, do not bother buying the CD unless you plan on cutting an edited version. It may have been cute in the play, but not on a CD to be played repeated. I do not fault the 'singer' but the one in charge of the production who let her do it that way. It can ruin it for the rest of the casts. Too bad she is also heard throughout many of the songs. Fran Drescher had a softer, gentler voice on the Nanny."

It can ruin it for the rest of the casts. Too bad she is also heard throughout many of the songs. Fran Drescher had a softer, gentler voice on the Nanny."
2,The original is far better,"The songs are good, but I find Lucy's voice to be so grating as to have to skip almost every song she is in. Sally's voice is good in song, but uses the same shrill speaking tones as Lucy. Linus's lisping is almost as bad.'New Philosophy' is delightful and 'Glee Club Rehearsal' is fun but I find the other new songs average and the rewrites of the original songs dissapointing.On it's own it's might be fine but for me it suffers in comparison to the original."
4,Original Producton Was Better,"The original 1960's production sounded much better. This revival adds unnecessary new songs, expanding the simple play to include new Peanuts characters such as Sally, and makes unneeded revisions to some of the original songs. Note that as usual, Amazon is still the best website for downloading the widest variety of mp3 selections at the lowest price in the shortest time."
3,"Good, not great, cast album (with exceptions)","Broadway revival cast albums are a tricky thing -- how do you make something fresh, while not copying the original, and not making a mess of it, either?This 1999 revival cast of YOU'RE A GOOD MAN, CHARLIE BROWN is fairly decent. The arrangements have life, the performances are enthusiastic, and the humor is simple and clear.Anthony Rapp, Roger Bart, and the fabulous Kristin Chenoweth do a great job. A little silly, a little cartoonish, and perfectly suited for the material.Unfortunately, a few of the other performers aren't well-suited for this music. Ilana Levine is a little TOO over-the-top and comes across as inauthentic, and B.D. Wong just has too much vibrato to be playing a young boy.If you're looking for only one recording of this terrific musical, I'd suggest you go with the original Broadway cast. But if you're a fan of the musical (or of any of these performers), this is a good addition to your collection."
4,A Cute Show,"I recently directed a production of You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown. The show is really sweet, though it is hard to make sure that it is not overly ""cutzy"". I like the vocalist in this updated version, though some of the modernization of the songs are overdone.Chenoweth is a great addition as Sally. She fits the part really well. ""Happiness"" is the sweetest song which really is the highlight of the show. Admittedly it may not be everyone's taste and Lucy's voice can be grading, but it is hard not to love this show."
1,scratched,"The item, a CD, had a scratch close to the center of the disc. I didnt notice it at first but I did notice that the disc had to be coaxed to play in my car and wouldn't play at all in a ""boom box"". Now it wont play in the car either."
4,A VERY CUTE MUSICAL FOR CHILDREN,"If you're looking to get your children interested in musical theatre, you might want to buy this CD to show them how fun it can be. I've been doing musical theatre for 5 or 6 years now, and this is one musical that I haven't done, but would love to do. It's great for any theatre-goer who is still a kid at heart."
5,This CD is awesome!,"I love this CD! Anthony Rapp is just, awesome. Kristen Chenoworth is great, ""My New Philosophy"" is my favorite. Roger Bart is hilarious, and so is Illana Levine. B.D. Wong is good too, and so is Stanley Mathis. Too bad the show closed before I ever got to see it.. at least I have this great CD =)"
5,I would give it 10 STARS if I could!,"I have never heard the original recording, but there is no way you can listen to THIS revival cast recording and not smile. ""My New Philosphy"" sung wonderfully by Kristin Chenoweth, is so witty and fun that I had to listen to it 10 times before moving on. Roger Bart as Snoopy is flawless, and the rest of the cast is great. In a nutshell, ""You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"", will undoubtedly tickle your funny bone many times!"
2,"If you love the original, don't buy this one...","I guess I'm a traditionalist, and grew up with the original cast recording. I didn't like this new version at all. You're in luck though! The original cast recording is now available."
5,A Family Favorite,"It's good music to listen to in the car. It's appropiate for everyone of every age. It also teaches children how to appreciate the arts,since it's based on a children's program that everyone knows and loves."
5,They did a great job with the remake!,"At my school we are doing the original YAGMCB and I wish we had some of the new songs esp. ""My New Philosophy."" The original is still really good though I wish I had the tapes!"
2,Rough Guide to Thailand,"Fed up with the traditional Lonely Planet I turned to the Rough Guide for an alternative view. While this guide gives detailed historical/background knowledge it severely lacks in the essentials, notably transport prices and detailed maps.@There were just too many times when this book became a more of a frustration than a help. This book is best read before you go and left at home."
3,Solid travel guide,"Full of great and relevant information. Some prices have already gone up, despite how recently the book came out, but that's par for the course in Asia. It would have been nice if there were place names spelled out in Thai a bit more, so you could point them out to taxi drivers. They rarely spoke English and my pronunciation of the romanized Thai words wasn't up to snuff. It's also not as handy as a reference guide for looking up phone numbers or addresses to hotels, restaurants, etc. as say the Lonely Planet. It does provide a bit better context though and reads more comfortably. All in all, a good book. I bought it because it was so recent, but think I may go back to Lonely Planet for most future travel guides."
2,Not very useful,"Do your research on line before going to any of the hotels suggested in this guide. Some of them are real dumps. Also, the guide does little to show you how to get around the country. I'm spoiled by Rick Steves guides that basically take you step by step on how to get out of the airport and to the sights, restaurants, hotels, etc. There are no prices and maps of Bangkok do not even show where the airport is at. It doesn't do what a guide is supposed to do, guide you. It gives a general overview of each city and gives a history lesson, but not much else. I have to wonder if the people who wrote the book actually went to Thailand or just read about it. Waste of money if you ask me. Something to read while on the toilet, otherwise I'm doing all me research on line."
1,Not what I was expecting,"This DVD is a waste of money, you can't see the how she does the exercise well kind of dark when it stared and they keep the camera to far way. If you need something that you can be visual like me this is not the right DVD. I am very disappointed."
4,A Nice Short Practice,"Shiva Rea is my favorite yoga teacher and I like all of her DVD's , though this is her least exciting one in my opinion , the main 20 min practice (Heart salutation) is a nice relaxing series of side stretches and backbends like camel and bow. Like other reviewer have mentioned the other 2 segments are short and a little bit ""parve"" though I liked the 3 min. moving meditation at the end. There's also 2 bonus segments that you can add to your practice from Fluid Power (Jala Namaskar) and Yoga Trance Dance (Twisting Kriya) though ""Jala Namaskar"" was also on Trance Dance with a different setting. On the whole , it's a nice short practice that you can add to other workouts as a stretch or do it on its own if you don't feel like doing much. Also take a look at her live DVD from Yoga Journal, a new practice cd ""Yoga Wave"" coming in february and a new DVD ""Surf Yoga Soul"" next year , can't wait!"
4,Shiva Rea Radiant Heart Yoga,"This is a very good Yoga DVD for all levels of people who enjoy a Yoga workout using a DVD. It is fairly easy, but you will get a good work-out in about 35 minutes. The instruction is easy to follow leaving you relaxed and ready to start the day."
4,An Engaging Adventure,"This is the story of Libby, a young American girl who lives in England for a year and a half. She is naturally independent and spunky, yet learns that being polite means caring about others' feelings. Overall, this book is wonderful; it's engaging in a way that too few books are. Schoolgirl Libby is a joy to watch as she travels to England and attends boarding school, encountering difficulties and misadventures along the way. Unfortunately, author Libby Koponen's writing is a tad overly simplified, and she fails to fully transform her voice into that of a true child. Koponen instead comes across as an adult trying to write like a child. Still, that's my sole complaint about this great book."
2,Just Okay,Gold Toe makes good dress socks but falls short on athletic socks. These socks lack the padding and comfort of Wigwam and are just not as well made as Gold Toe dress socks
1,NO One-Size fits all,"I have been buying gold-toe socks for years. Until about three years ago, I was very pleased with gold-toe. However, in the past few years I have found that the socks stretch out of shape after only a few washings. To claim to make a sock that fits sizes 6-12 shoe is patently impossible. Oh, at first it may. But I wear size 7 1/2 shoe and guess what? You got it! After a while it is at least an inch too long and the heal comes up on the Achilles-tendon. These socks are clearly not made for the smaller foot size.Unless you start making a sock that fits a lower range of sizes, you have lost a long-time customer."
5,You Will Love The Hybrid Feature,"I always say that there is technology you can use and technology you can impress others with.This model helps you do both. You have a nice 5.1 MP still camera and MPEGMovie4TV video.The very fact that you have a camera which you can take both still pictures and video is huge. I never had a video camera before because I hate to carry two camera and a big camera case, so this was the obvious solution.I realize that instead of embracing the moment (for which they need the memory) most people often juggle between cameras.Cons:* Sometimes people might confuse it with camera phone* Buttons are harder to find* Software is not the best* Wish had more zoomPros:* Convince* Compact* Battery lasts long* Flash is good* Video sound quality is goodI wonder why this model has not swept the market - another story of good product and mad marketing."
3,Best video recorder/camera for 2006,"I needed a point-and-shooter for my trip to Tibet. This one fit the bill and I'm happy with the result.That said, it's 2010, and the camera takes fuzzy shots, has some software glitches where I can't stop the video recorder until I flip the camera off.I guess it's hard to write a review in 2010 for a product I thought was pretty decent in 2006."
4,This is a good product!,"This is a good product. It smells really good, however the spray inside got stuck for me 2 -3 times and it works absolutely fine now. I wanted a nonalcoholic deodorant and I got it. Would recommend others."
5,Fun for the Whole Family,This is the third Playtime video for our family and they just continue to engage us. Both my sons enjoy watching and doing the videos with anyone who will play with them. Our older son blows the bubbles for our younger one to watch and pop. He will also act as an obstacle for the younger one to crawl over. We all enjoy participating as a family. These videos are great for the whole family and what is even better is that we can play them whenever and as often as we want.
3,One Nice Surprise,"I picked up this DVD because, every now and then, I enjoy watching the bad martial arts movies that came out of the 1980s and 1990s. This is definitely one of those, with a typical story line, bad cinematography, and the expected over acting.The one thing that I was surprised about is that a very young, very hot Scott Shaw appears in this film as the bad guy cohort of David Carradine. At least for me, that made this movie worth the watch."
1,THIS ONE BELONGS IN THE GAS CHAMBER,"One of Gary Daniels' earlier movies, this turgid and inept bomb is poorly lit, poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed. Daniels, who has improved considerably over the years, is very bad in this one, about as convincing as a toddler in this role. The supporting cast, which also includes a pointless David Carradine, is also awful. The fight scenes are so obviously staged, you can almost see the actors counting their moves. A real loser!"
5,"A fascinating, detailed account","BOX BOATS: HOW CONTAINER SHIPS CHANGED THE WORLD tells how the first container ship in 1956 changed the entire shipping industry, introducing a concept and transportation idea which would revolutionize the costs of shipping goods. From the Pan-Atlantic's owner who first thought about loading his trucks on board to his evolving line which grew into a giant container service, Cudahy charts not just the evolution of one company, but its impact on and changes within the world shipping and steamship industries as a whole. A fascinating, detailed account.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,Don't Let The Title Fool You,"I found the book dreadfully dull. Its in-depth discussion of container ships has little whatsoever to do with an analytical overview of their impact upon the global economy.Certainly this is suitable for box-boat enthusiasts, but will hold little interest for political scientists or economists. Perhaps a better subtitle would have been ""the history of container ships."""
2,A single you'll Soon Forget.,"I've rated this single as two stars not because I don't like Pearl Jam or ""Binaural"", but because there is really no need for anyone to get this particular single. ""Light Years"" is a top-notch song, but it's available on ""Binaural"" for everyone to hear. The two live B-Sides come from the band's warm-up show and thus are not included on any of the live bootlegs, but please take my word when I say that if you get the Katowice 2 bootleg album, you'll get great live versions of these two songs, as well as more than 25 others (and yes, ""Light Years"" is also included on that bootleg, but it's not one of my favorite versions). This single is also horrendously overpriced, considering that you can get the identical U.S. version of it for about $... on this same site."
1,like a broken record....,"this type of plot has been done over..and over..and over again! the gun shot effects in the beginning are cheesy enough to turn you away yet i kept watching it, its a low budget film. And i have nothing wrong with that, but the plot was so over done and the acting was close to horrible. i'm only 15 and i could have acted WAY better than they did! And the sex scenes were so un nessisary and overdone. it seems they only had those in there to attract stupid horny guys...and its STEAL cheesy...i dont know WHERE these places get their actors but damn..i know ppl that could of have put more heart into it, atleast make up for its cheesyness..that aspect is just...sad...ya x_x!"
1,Witches and killers,"If you think that killers are the good guys and witches are evil, this may be your movie. This is some warped persons fantasy about what they might do if they had ""powers"". It's more scary from the view of the acting skills, scriptwriter skills, and production skills than the subject of the movie. It isn't quite good enough to make MST3K."
5,XP problems easily fixed! Great game!,"Several reviews mention the difficulties of running the game in Windows XP, I encountered some difficulties myself...and here is how to change them.Firstly, don't autoron the first CD when you first insert it, open up the CD, and right click the TLCTour.exe, in Properties, click to emulate running it in Windows 95. The game should now install and run fine. There are a few screen glitches, as it changes between the regular setting and the 256 colors of Windows 95, however, the game runs easily, without needing any downloads, from what I've seen.On a side note, however, the game seems to rarely actually catch any fish."
4,This DOES work on XP,"In order to get it to install on Windows XP, you open ""my computer"" and right click on the cd and click ""open"". You'll then want to change the way it installs from ""windows 95"" to ""windows 98/Windows ME"". Then it will install and play just fine."
5,Review of TV version,"I watched the television program version. I'm not sure if the DVD differs, but the program was great. If you're an ocean loving person it is absolutely worth owning. It is, however, hard to stay emmersed in the content while knowing that Steve Irwin died in the making."
1,Not Good,"As a non-gamer and with all my knowledge of Eberron coming from the novels I found that the Crimson Talisman at the start was enjoyable with the undead attacking the castle and the run from Rookstack with what happened to Vaddi friend as I wasn't expecting that. I also enjoyed the scenes with the Hippo-griff and the Murughel elves but that was all what was enjoyable to meAfter finishing reading the book it came across to me like a children's fantasy novel with the romance between Vaddi and the elf-girl (forgotten her name) and the author kept on reminding the reader after every so many pages that the peddler is may be more than just a peddler and can Vaddi really trust Cellestar the cleric this irritate me to no endI was also expecting all the vampires not just Caerzaal to be more intelligent, Caerzaal is one of the worst villains I have ever read in a fantasy novel and for Vaddi to find out what the hell the Crimson Talisman actually does"
2,Worst Eberron book?,"I am a huge fan of the Eberron campaign setting for D&D so of course I wanted to read some of the novels based on the setting. While none of the novels have blown me away with their greatness, this one was far below par. The book feels like a D&D adventure that I played when I was [...]. Their seems to be no real point, just one dangerous and seemingly random situation after another. To be honest I could not even finish the book so perhaps there is some redemption at the end, but I just couldn't keep reading. If you are interested in checking out the Eberron novels I highly recommend starting with something else, perhaps Keith Baker's series or Tim Waggoner or Rich Wulf's. Any of those is a much better choice."
1,Stay away from this one...,"I've been reading the D&D; novels since the late 80s and am sad to say that this was the worst one I've yet come across. The characterization is at best laughable, and almost pitiable at times. The dialog is almost painful to read, as character after character give lines that sound anything but conversational. The characters never develop a voice of their own throughout the story making it very hard to follow exactly what they are saying Mr. Cole tries to paint some interesting action sequences, but scale and scope are lost in poor prose and a very weak command of pacing.The Eberron setting is an incredible world, ripe with ideas for excellent fiction, however the Crimson Talisman really doesn't live up to the world's potential."
2,so-so,"It has it's moments I'll give it that. Overall not a great novel but I can see where some people will like it.If you like this type of book, might I suggest another I've recently come arcoss. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly reccomend it. It's definitely a better read."
1,So bad that I can not get beyond page 50...,"The author needs to learn how to write and not sound like a high school freshman trying to cover every least detail. The first four pages are horrid, but I continued forward until I realized that I had commercials to watch on TV.The characters are so 2-dimentional, that calling them flat would be an insult. The characters are stiff and when the author tries to convey information about the world of Eberron through the characters, that information seems to shock them even though the characters should have a firm grasp of their own reality.This was the worst book that I have bought in 20 years, hands down."
4,Good windsurfing video,Great video on windsurfing. It has all the greats doing amazing stuff at locations all around the world. The movie is fairly short (about 20 minutes) but there is an advanced instructional video on the disk that is about 30 minutes with a lot of good tips and techniques.
4,A good R&B track for the dancefloor,No More by Ruff Endz is a subtle fusion of R&B and hip hop. A good song to play at clubs to get people dancing. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys dance music.
3,Looks like very used,"This product new is OK but,the one that i received looks like used or was in demo at some store."
4,"tall, dark and sexy thriller","THE PSCYCHO LOVER PLOT IS GIVEN A SLIGHT TWIST HERE ,AS THE MAN IS THE ONE WHO JUST WONT TAKE NO AS AN ANSWER TO HIS FATAL ATTRACTION.JACK SCALIA PLAYS A VERY SEXY ROLE HERE, HIS GOOD LOOKS AND INSTANT WINNING SMILE MAKE HIM AN EASY LOVER FOR KIM DELANY TO GO WEAK AT THE KNEES FOR,BUT, ALL IS NOT AS IT SEEMS. THE PLOT HAS SOME GREAT THRILLING MOMENTS ,IF NOT TOTALLY UNEXPECTED, HOWEVER ENOUGH SEX APPEAL IS CREATED BETWEEN THE TWO LEADS TO MAKE THIS AN EROTIC THRILLER TO WATCH."
3,A faith building study,"For the layman, Ross' commentary paints a picture across Old Testament history. Strengthens today's believer by throwing a spotlight on Bible events and interpreting them with studied precision to point to a personal God.Useful as a daily devotional too."
5,"Adds New Life to an old ""War Horse""","I purchased this recording out of the US. They had it at a listening station. After listening to it, I had to buy it. She adds new life to the music. There is new ornamentation. This is a must recording for anyone who has heard this old standby and wants to hear a new and exciting rendition. The album also includes ""The Devils's Trill Sonata"" by Tartini, ""Devil's Trill"" and ""Reflection""."
5,"Moving, Beautiful and Powerful","The Original Four Seasons and Devil's Trill Sonata by Vanessa-Mae is my favorite CD. I bought it 4 years ago because I wanted to add violin music to my diverse collection of CDs. I listen to a variety of music, including jazz, rock, blues, modern, and opera. I never expected to enjoy Vanessa's CD as much as I do.. It's moving and beautiful and has the power to transform an average day into an exceptional day."
3,Not my favorite recording of the 4 Seasons,"I am a violinist, and truthfully don't really like the way Vanessa plays the 4 seasons. Her tone is fine, but she just seams to be lacking in certain areas. It doesn't sound like the rich, beautiful 4 seasons I know. I relize that it is baroque and shouldn't sound TOO rich and sappy, but she should take more time with them, truley get to know the pieces instead of just playing through them. I would definitley prefir the standard 4 seasons the way Vivaldi wrote them, rather than Mae's version- with her out-of-place sounding artificial harmonics(which didn't sound so good tone-wise) and her strange sounding double stops and octaves. If you think Vanessa's 4 seasons sound ""cool in a newer way"", great- buy them. But if you truley have a trained classical ear, consider a different version of the 4 seasons."
2,"Somewhat different, but heard better","Let me go on the record to say that Vanessa Mae does the violin crossover style extremely well. Her breakthrough album ""Violin Player"" remains one of my favourite albums. However this album of the purely classical ""Original four seasons"" somewhat lacking.It certainly is innovative, and she does put a different spin on this timeless piece of music. It also has it's good moments in the spring and summer sections. Unfortunately she fails compare to other classical violinists . The ""Autumn"" and ""Winter"" Sections are very weak. If there had been fusion versions of this work, then this album might have something to offer as part of another genre. But this is a classical album, and unfortunately doesn't compare to works by Perlman, Kennedy, Chang or Menuhin.It's not a bad album, but since this is a purely classical album, it should be compared to other classical albums. If you want a good 4 seasons album get Nigel Kennedy's version."
1,Barely Deserves 1 Star,"I think that this ""interpertation"" of Vivaldi's Four Seasons is a stupid experiment gone wrong. Her Inventions and ""Improvisations"" might be a nice idea, but to a real musician this recording is a mockery of good musicianship."
1,"Childish, Mischievious,Ludicrous !",It sound like a 5year old mischievious girl fooling with violin for pure curiosity! it make no sense to serious classical music but probabily still sounds 3stars if you take it for a vivaldi-pop.
1,Not that great,"Yes, Vanessa-Mae is talented, but she's not the best violinist in the world. There are many more world violinists who could play much better than Vanessa-Mae, like, Midori, Joshua Bell, Sarah Chang, Akiko Suwanai etcAfter listening to The Original Four Seasons And The Devil's Trill Sonata by Vanessa Mae, I think that it's not really nice to place something that related to Pop music into a classical album. Honestly, she played badly and I can't say I really enjoyed the CD."
4,a MORE OR less SPLENDID album!,"One of the best things I like aboud this cd was that it didn't stick in my head,but it WAS Very catchy. I particularly like:mama loo,hippie from missisippi,and the foreign witch doctor song:hombre mago.Its great how it's not too serious and puts me,my freinds and many others in a happy mood!!!(it can get annoying after a while)"
4,interesting...,"Although they dont know how to sing that well it is interesting about what kind of songs they sing. Oh yeah, they're Witch Doctor is on Dance Dance Revolution 6th mix!"
5,awesome,My husband read this book when he was younger. I bought it as a surprise for him and he loved it.
4,Good read,"A good read. I like Anne McCaffrey's universe. I'd like to read more books on ""Brains ships""!! A book to download."
4,A Great Book Indeed,"It was just fun to read, interesting story, and I liked the caracters, what more can I say..."
2,Collection of sub par stories,I had no idea I was reading a collection of short stories and that did not help. I kept on waiting for the main story to develop. When I did realize I was not reading an entire book I set it aside. Why bother reading more of the same 'go no where' stories?It's hard to believe that so many people loved it so much as to give it 5 stars.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In this setting, severely physically handicapped children are trained to be the 'brains' of spaceships, and are partnered with more physically able people who become the ship pilots.This follows one such person or ship in particular, who likes the whole music thing. She must also deal with the loss of a pilot and the introduction of another."
1,"Pass the cheese, please!","It amazed me that McAffrey's ""The Ship Who Sang"" could even be considered suitable for high school and middle school aged children to read. I am a 22-year-old senior in college and it took me four hours to get through the first three chapters and I couldn't force myself to go any further. The book is filled with explicit sexual undertones and so much ""cheesy"" writing that I was embarrassed to read it. I can't imagine a 13-year-old girl doing the same. Personally, I would never recommend this book to anyone, let alone attempt to teach it in a classroom situation."
4,Unique and informative,"I've never read anything quite like this book. Carefully researched and full of great information, but also a page-turner that even manages to succeed at humor, despite the subject matter. I'ved owned this book for years and I still take it off the shelf regularly. Truth is stranger than fiction, and this book does a great job of reminding us. The companion volume, ""Medical Histories of Union Generals"" is not as readable (though still quite good)."
2,Made for TV and should have stayed there.,"Trite made-for-TV movie with Victoria Principal as a woman trying to be a perfect housewife. After her father-in-law tires to rape her, her husband begins to question the mental state of his wife. With the help of his father he finds a doctor willing to medicate her into submission and into a mental hospital. Only after some horrific experiences does he being to realize the truth of what he has done to the woman he loves.As TV movies go this was below average. The plot was choppy and slow moving. And their contempt for the mental health system is so obvious you have to think the screenwriter was trying to get back as his shrink does. If this really based on a true story then there should have been some epilogue to cover what happened to the snake pit the lead was condemned to."
3,Interesting,"Purchased because Geraint Wyn Davies was in it -- and he was wonderful! Not the lead, but an important part."
4,easy installation,"The product is just as described and was surprisingly easy to install. I expected a fight with the ""memory"" of the rolled up plastic but found its tendency to curl easy to control. I used some 8"" of metal stakes from home depot as anchors about every 6 -8 feet. They did a good job of holding the plastic in place while I started at one end and buried the section in between the stakes. (I think you could have then removed and reused the stakes for the next section but I left them in place.)"
3,Not metal but works,"This stuff works good however you have to recess it a bit into the dirt or backfill it to keep the edging straight. The stakes that they sell separate, (Which is a rip IMO) you have to buy double the amount you think you need. They do not keep the edging straight, they are more for just holding it down. You can get metal stakes at the big box stores for a 1/4 the price of the plastic stakes and they seem to work a lot better. Overall its good material for small, DIY projects, I would avoid the plastic stakes and use something else."
4,Used this edging for a path,"I used this edging to make a very large path through my woods. It was a little hard when I opened it but in someones review they said to keep it in the sun and that did help make it easier to work with . My path looks pretty good, but the only thought is that if you want real straight line, you should invest in metal edging. Otherwise, this is great for the price and worked well for a creative path."
3,Good for lighter applications,I purchased this product to seperate a large rock dry stream bed from 3/8 inch landscaping rock. The edging will not stay in a straight line and appeared to be to light for this application. It looks good but I have to keep going back and repositioning the rocks to give it a consistent look. I also used this egding to contain mulch around several plants. This worked significantly better for that.
3,Not too bad,"Ordered the Master Mark 40x3 edging for a couple of backyard gardens. Overall the product is not too bad, wish it were a little more rigid. Easy to install, however after the first few feet I realized digging a small trench with a shovel was going too deep. I ended up using a large screwdriver to make a place for the edging to fit snugly in the ground. Using the screwdriver also worked better because it followed the lay of the land, which in turn allowed the edging to do the same."
4,Good purchase,"I'm very happy with the product. The edging is quite sturdy; but, make sure you follow the manufacturer's directions and set it out to warm up and make it more pliable or else you won't get a nice straight line. The stakes also worked well for me. The ground, while not rock hard dry, was not loose and I was able to pound them all in without any breakage."
2,Not a safe SAFETY gate!,"Though this gate was wide enough to accommodate our 4' wide stairway, it was so flimsy that my husband had to reinforce it at the bottom with a piece of 1x2 the length of the gate. If either of my 18 mo. old twins were to fall against it they would have went right through it!"
3,Not Thrilled,"I thought this CD would have been much better. I saw Kim Mitchell in Buffalo at a place called Melody Fair in 1996 with an American Indian playing bass & a drummer. They were freakin' phenomenal!!! I was a little disappointed with this CD, especially considering some of the rave reviews it got. At that concert I saw them at (I was in a band at that time that had Shanghai'd me - we opened for Kim Mitchell at that show!) Kim reminded me of a cross between Allan Holdsworth & Frank Zappa on guitar - phenomenal. This CD is not even close to that live performance. Maybe I need to listen to it some more (perhaps in time it will grow on me) but for now I can only give it 3 stars."
3,nostalgia,"used to goto the gasworks and the piccadilly tube (both on yonge street) to see max webster. bought this album when it first came out. it sadly wasn't representative of the live band. mitchell's choices of tunes were dubious at best. plus i didn't particularly like mitchell. i liked the band's rhythm section, mike tilka and paul kersey, and terry watkinson was an enjoyably insane keyboard player.""toronto tontos"" was my favourite track then and still is now."
4,My nephew loved this,I gave this to my nephew for his 4th birthday. He loved it & began to play with it before I even had it out of the box. My other nephew loved it as well and has asked for something similar for his 6th birthday.
4,Kids like it.,"I bought this for my 5 year old son and he really liked it. When it goes forward the thing pops out of the middle. The only thing is that the break away parts in the middle started separating and looking bad not long afterwards, but my son may have been rough with it."
3,"Loved it, but didn't last as long as we expected","My son loved the Grave Digger since he's a big monster truck fan. However, after not much use, this toy started falling apart."
2,Lacking compared to past releases,"I imported the European copy of Tiesto's ""Just Be"" several months ago. The tracks on this CD are decent, but do not live up to some of his past releases. After listening to his other albums such as ""In Search of Sunrise"", ""Summerbreeze"", the Magik series, etc., you wont be impressed with this CD."
3,Not his best work...,"I enjoy Tiesto's music, and that reason alone is why this album gets a 3 star rating. ""Just Be"" is a far cry from the Tiesto I've come to know and love. The first track is good...I especially like the orchestral introduction...but the album goes downhill from there, ending with a lack-luster mix of Adagio for Strings. Sorry...you just can't mix a classical piece of music in 6/8 time with a ""four on the floor"" trance beat. Some of the tracks are good...some aren't. Add in the fact that this is not a continuous mix, and you end up with one of my least favorite of all Tiesto's albums."
3,"Yes, it is mainstream!","And I can listen to mainstream by turning on my local radio. Tiesto has been on the top for such a long time that he's starting to forget what it means to be a trance DJ. Of course, this is an artist album and the songs are not supposed to be mixed into each other, so I am not judging it by that. However, the material itself does not flow together and there're very few memorable songs. ""Love Comes Again"" is a great track, a little cheesy for some but I still like it. ""Just Be"" might have a good message but the track itself is only average. ""Adagio for Strings""? On an artist album? Pleez! The only two people who can do that are... well, Samuel Barber and William Orbit.Tiesto is becoming a household name with those who still call this kind of music techno. And it is not bad-- just don't expect from this CD the level of excellence you find on Nyana."
2,Dj Tiesto fails on this one,Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good.TrafficURAdagio For StringsNyanaThose songs are just great and the best off the album.But songs likeWalking On CloudsSweet MiseryLove Comes AgainForever Todaycan only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though. No song here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it. Cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff.Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoyingVerdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 Not bad for the first 20 listens but damn I could have enjoyed it much more!
1,Im just being honest,"i was so disapointed with this album, i was expecting something that i could actually listen to, if you look at tiesto's older tracks, his remix of Flesh, and his remix of never look back by dumonde, i mean those tracks were just inspirational, even flight 643 even though it kind of dragged on was excellent because it was just original and the general sound of it was something you could really get into, this album however, it makes me think hes just using the fact that he has alot of fans to get away with poorly inspired tracks, im not saying his production is bad, but his ideas are so dead boring, its such a shame in my opinion, it could have been so much more personal, instead its cold and just plain un-inspired. some tracks on their own are ok, adaigo is at least different from the norm, and love comes again is catchy and i like Bt, Tiesto, where has your gift from God gone? what have you done with it?"
4,Solid Album,"Many superstar DJs have gone over to the ""dark side"" of trance music to sound more mainstream and fill their albums with tons of vocals and guest appearences. Tiesto is close, but manages to produce an album that still remains trance. I have to say I fully enjoyed it and even the very mainstream sounding songs were done very well. There aren't really any tracks that are weak. I would give it 5 stars, but as much I as enjoy vocals on some songs I didn't expect or wanted to hear so many. With that said it is still an excellent album.Tiesto manages to succeed with the vocals and somewhat untrance like moments on the album where PVD fails on his latest attempt ""Reflections"".As someone mentioned, this is an album where Tiesto is emerging as an artist versus being just a DJ. So there are no reasons, why a hardcore trance fan or just a passerby shouldn't enjoy ""just be""."
4,Very Good Artist Album,"Most times, artist albums by dj's who are known for mixing and remixing are not very good; Tiesto's 1st artist album ""In My Memory"" is proof of that. I think Tiesto learned from the mistakes of that album when creating music for this one. Most of the tracks are good, with the already released singles ""Traffic"" and ""Love Comes Again"" being very good. This disc cannot be compared to Tiesto's mix cd's because that would be like comparing apples and oranges. Overall, this cd is worth listening to and very good both musically and lyrically. I am just hoping that his next release will be In Search of Sunrise Volume 4."
3,Can't Be,"This is definetly not Tiesto's best CD. I feel like a lot heart and energy were not fully generated into this CD. Not every song makes you feel like your listening to the greatest DJ in the world. I think that he should have added a couple more tracks and left out NYANA from Just Be. The song was already on the NYANA album and should not be added again. So instead of hearing 10 new songs, you only get 9. Just being an honest fan."
2,Just Be QUIET ALREADY!,"First of all let me ask you, Who said BT could sing? I don't know whats wrong with these guys (Tiesto, PVD, BT) Theyre supposed to make music that makes you want to dance! All of a sudden they feel they are ""artistes"" and start to make these albums where the front cover is their face so that everybody recognizes them, then you open the cd and want to read the credits only to find the DJ posing like a model.It seems that to these guys the quality of the songs in an album comes last. As a former Tiesto freak ( I used to love the guy) I am sad to say this DJ couldnt resist it anymore and finally sold out. I saw it coming since the release of Nyana. Tiesto is going to play live @ space in Miami next week, and I for one am not going to go."
2,Wheres the mixing.. arent DJs supposed to mix?,"im a big tiesto fan.. but i just dont get this cd... track selection i will say is not the fault of this cd.. but what pokes at me is that several times during this cd songs are gapped apart.. arent djs supposed to mix songs together .. tiesto has taken me on very enjoyable trips with his sets. so has acosta, PVD, sasha, oaken, and others but this cd took me almost nowhere. listening to this, right when i start getting pulled out of myself and taken on that trance trip (bang) the song ends and a few seconds later the next song starts. im dissapointed :-) ive heard that djs mixing techniques have been getting simplified lately (Nyana) but this is BS"
1,JUST SUCKS!,"Easily said...the biggest dissapointment of 2004!This is pop-trance crap...what the heck is going on with Tiesto?...He has sold out to the mainstream audience,its all about the money I guess.This is the crappiest electronic dance cd of all time ...dont waste your money on this pathetic piece of dookie.This album is poorly put together and anyone messing around on a synth can figure these stupid sounds out.If ya wanna hear some of his best stuff go for any of the ""Magik"" or ""In Search of Sunrise"" series ,also ""Summerbreeze""isnt too shabby either.Magik 6 and In Search of SR 3 is the best.And whats this I hear about him coming out with an olympics tribute cd ...????Whats next ,MTV videos?...This is one dj that was once my favorite but now Im avoiding any future releases and you should too if you are smart!!!"
2,Tiesto's worst.,"First off, I am a Trance Addict. I just bought this cd and for tiesto I am dissapointed. I am in training in the army so I havent seen it, but I have listened to it. My favorite of his albums are Magik 6 and 7. This cd just plain sucks, I feel ripped, I want a refund. Harsh and opinionated yes, but thats how I feel, so listen to it for yourself."
4,Just Be,This is really a just be yourself album is definitely not a dance record but instead one great effort as an artist record for Tiesto i think some of the songs specially love comes again is one who save this record and make it a good one definitely you can listen to the touch of BT one of trance Geniuses.
4,Tiesto Proves That He Really is the World's Best DJ!,"I recently purchased Tiesto's newest release, Just Be. I was astounded! A more mellow and deeper trance style than he has ever produced, but with that shows his growth as a DJ. With the opening track ""Forever Today"", you see his broad range of skills, and tracks such as ""Just Be"" and ""Adagio for Strings"" just set in the ground stomping beats that Tiesto has always been able to deliver. I recently caught his show in Belgium, and would have to say that it was the best 8 hours of my life. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who wants to expand their musical horizons!--Will"
4,Just listen and enjoy it,"I really enjoy ""In My Memory"" album,so I was so glad that Tiesto finally made another production. I bought ""Just Be"" and I enjoy it very much. From this CD, I like Adagio for Strings the MOST. I have listen to Samuel Barber version..and Tiesto remix of that song, BLEW me away. Just prove me more that Tiesto is the BEST DJ (mixer) EVER. Btw, I was so proud that he performed at the opening Ceremony of the Olympic (he was the only reason why i watch the opening)I like the flow of the songs in this CD. The songs in this CD are great for chilling out or for party. Just get the CD and listen to it. Whether you like it instantly (like me) or it'll grow on you. But let me tell you..once you listen to Tiesto...there is no way of going back...but hey..who wants too..you'll enjoy it there."
5,Tiesto,"I didn't buy the album yet, but on June 12 I was on Tiesto's performance in Manhattan, NY. IT WAS OF THE HOOK!!! He was spinning for 3.5 hours! definitely will buy the album."
4,Bonus dvd?,"i just recieved my import with bonus dvd. On the back of the box it listed only Disc 1 & 2, but no mention of the DVD.Disc 2 contains the 7 bonus remix tracks.Where is the DVD???Does any on have a DVD with it?Ca"
2,Tiesto has lost his marbles,"A huge Tiesto fan of the past, I have to say I was incredibly dissapointed. A few nice vocals but thats it. Anyone who rates this highly hasn't been listening to trance much. This is just not the tiesto we use to know. Success has definitely gone to his head. He has sold out to the mainstream crowd. His trance sounds more like pop now. Also it seems he is trying to incorporate some new style or something with his choice of some of the sounds and it sounds incredibly annoying. Tiesto needs to find his marbles and get back to the real sounds that made him no.1"
2,"This ""Just Be""Terrible","This is by far the worst dance album ever produced.How did such a good dj like Tiesto stoop this low and come out with such junk?The reason I gave it two stars is because I enjoy two tracks on the cd ...""love comes again""(with BT,i think its called) and ""just be"",the others just plain suck!Dont waste your money on this,avoid this cd at all costs,c'mon get with the program Tiesto!I highly recommend his latest album ,""Parade of the Athletes""to all dance fans,you'll enjoy it alot better."
2,Weak and Overhyped!,"I bought this CD because I wanted to know what all the hype was about, but apparently there shouldn't be any!The CD starts off very dramatic, sounding classical and operatic, only to dive into prolonged beats, hooks, and an ongoing (...) of melody, wailing, and cheesy trance riffs. There is little originality here (much less creativity) and the entire project sounds like Tiesto is just trying way too hard.There are some ""OK"" moments such as the already tired collabiration with BT, ""Love Comes Again,"" and the sometimes even pretty sounding ""Walking on Clouds,"" but this isn't really worth the money. If you're looking for something more creative and original try Oakenfold's 2002 release ""Bunkka"" and give yourself a break. It's going to take many more DJ sets to get me convinced that this guy is worth more than five minutes of my time!"
4,"seller very honest, shipping speed was good","I had a problem with the cd, first they tried to fix it and then they replaced it right away."
2,Review from the Synthesis,"With Paper White and Big Black Square, Tarentel walk a fine line between what's considered an EP as opposed to a full-length album. The release of Big Black Square is a 40-minute-plus improvisation that makes the listening experience tedious. Tarentel have a vague idea of where they want to go, they just don't have a compass, and nothing proves this more than the aforementioned track. Ambient noises and feedback play out for 15 minutes before the drumbeat comes in, going for another 15 minutes over feedback before finally fading away into more ambient noises. Paper White is somewhat of the same approach, yet the songs are much shorter, with softening touches of acoustic guitar and piano leaving one pleasantly confused.- Nick WalkerSynthesis.net"
1,Disappointed,"I bought two copies, one for me and one for my daughter, who writes poetry. Neither of us has found a poem we really liked. Too many of the poems are ""I oriented"" and unhappy. Not my cup of tea."
1,Warning! Movies defaced with logo,"If you are contemplating buying this DVD, you should be aware that the manufacturer has superimposed its ""Platinum Disc Corporation"" logo in the bottom right corner of the screen throughout the movies. All of the movies on this disc are available from other manufacturers who are more respectful of the films. Check the listings here at Amazon.com for the ""no logo"" versions from Roan and other suppliers. (Please note I would have given this disc zero stars but that option is not available.)"
1,Piece of Junk!!!,"I purchased this toaster (not from Amazon)and about two weeks later the toaster oven button would not stay down. I returned the plug (as instructed) to Black&Decker and another toaster (same model) was mailed to me. Can you believe the button on the new toaster would not stay down either!!! When I contacted B&D, they said to mail the plug back to them!!! I give up!!! I will never, ever purchase another toaster from B&D again!!!"
2,Will not survive the warranty period,"One of the heating elements broke (actually burst open) on ours after 6 months of normal use. Not impressive. It never maintained temperature well, so using it to bake was nearly impossible."
4,the workout is great,"but her voice gets grating. Not her fault. Learn the routine and mute it before you memorize what she's saying. ""Squawk squawk squawk!"""
3,Great content/Poor quality,"A group of friends & I exercise regularly to some of the DVDs by Leslie Sansone. Unfortunately, the DVD do not last very long before they skip, stutter and won't play. We've tried different DVD players and the discs are just bad. I just purchased this DVD when it was released and we used it 2 times and now it won't play. It would be worth it to pay a little more for a better quality DVD. The exercise with the power intervals is great so it's a real pity that the content is not stored on better discs."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"The flow of the DVD is not very good. You do one mile then it stops and you go to a different mile. It is just awkward. I like the idea of intervals, but the ""surges"" are too long and they can exhaust you. I have DVDs done by others with intervals and their ""intervals"" are not as long as Sansones. I do not know if she is getting bad advice on her timing or they make it long for her to talk, and talk, and talk. Also, if you have to exercise on carpet this DVD will be bad for your knees because she incorporates some twists in her ""power surges"" and your feet will catch on the carpet. Generally, I enjoy her DVDs---this one is not one of my favorites."
5,"New music, new moves, new Leslie! Fab!","Just rcvd the new 4 mile Power Walk Dvd today w/power surges. I did the 2 miles power walk after I did walk slim firm 4 fast miles. Love the new dvd!! Surges are Extremly powerful! Moves are all new! Mini jacks, twists, etc ADVISE: Sports bra is a MUST!! When doing the power surges you will be bouncing everywhere if u do not have a sports bra on! I did not have one on & I couldnt do every move completely bc I was flopping around if u know what I mean! I am a 34 C, pretty decent size, would also recommend form fitting yoga pants as well or your entire body will flop around during the surges, unless u have zero fat! Great new music! Only 27 mins for 2 miles, flew by! For advanced walkers only!"
4,Good Enough!!,"Just different enough to inject some ""newness"" and diversion from the other 50 or so DVDs I own that Leslie has pioneered. Walking and increased speed, along with complete body moves is Leslie's staple. This one is a keeper, but mainly because it is a little different and more modern than those before it. I will keep purchasing the new DVDs by Leslie mainly because I agree with her concept of relatively low impact exercise on my 65 year old joints. It works everytime, but there is never a real DIFFERENCE in her technique; just a few new moves and more modern people walking with her. LOVE HER!"
4,Variety,I have many of her videos and like how the newer ones have a faster pace as well as strenth training.
5,fantastic overview,This book has a perfect sample of religious thought during the American Revolution as expressed in sermons from both sides of the Atlantic. Great to read through or sample from. Well presented as well with readable typeface.
5,The Wise Woman is a profound and superb allegory,"Next to the Bible, this book has impacted my life more than any other. If one would truly enjoy taking a good, honest look at one's character, this is the book! It is a frightening mirror of our own humanity, yet one that will inspire change!"
3,For Novice Beginners Only......,"Well I purchased this video attempting to get my hands on any break dance video that existed. When I received the video I was disappointed by the quality of production. Mike does an excellent job in demonstrating the movies, but the video is extremely amatuer. This video is strickly for novist and fresh to the floor beginners. If you've been break dancing for any length of time, no matter how bad you are, their are more useful videos than this one. Like I said though, this is great for the people who saw break dancing for the first last weekend at a party or club and decided they would like to participate. If you know something about hip-hop dance already then look for a video called ""Basic Moves."" This will give you a little clearer view on technique. Keep Breaking!LaterDays,-Jerusalem Kid"
4,good and useful,"This is a good and useful tape for everyone who wants to start and learn how to practicing break dance. Brings you back to the heroic eighties !!! However the quality of the tape is poor, looks like a 5 times copied version, its time to release on DVD."
3,human beats on that urban vinyl,"I've been breakin since the days when joust and tron were overflowing their coin buckets with bicentennial quarters. The card board on the street corner was my turn table and I was scratching human beats on that urban vinyl. I got a Beta VCR player, so I can play the tape - but the cover looks like its a winner!Keep up the good work my man - tha breakin beats gotta come back to the streets!"
3,"Mixed CD, Not individual tracks!","Grrrr... idiot record companies releasing mixed music compilations without letting customers know is very anoying. How difficult is it to write 'non stop mix' or evn the name of the mixer on the front of the album. I for one don't want mixed tracks... as a DJ they are no use to me. Let people know BEFORE buying the compilation how the tracks are arranged (mixed or unmixed) and let the consumer decide which format they wish to buy.For those who wish to know, the mix is by DJ Nuff Stuff and is'nt bad... just no use to me."
3,Should be called CLUB HITS 2006 (SIX) & IT'S MIXED!,"First of all - most of this music is from the summer and late fall of 2006 (heck the copyright even says 2006). A lot of record company's are doing this now to extend the shelf life. Why don't they just call it ""Hot Club Hits Vol. 1"" and so on like the Now Music series. Next - it is NOT indicated on the package but this is a MIXED CD (and I unfortunately didn't see the earlier review on Amazon until now). OK - otherwise the music is fun and the mixing is good - but ALSO be aware the mixes are short (some are even 3 minutes and less but this may be good if you like to exercise & want to keep things moving) even though it says ""Stonebridge Remix"" - it should really say ""Stonebridge EDIT"" - so that's 3 strikes - 3 stars. Finally, it is very electro which I think is great - but there are more upbeat 'anthem' like mixes that are available out there."
4,Tree-Our Day Will Come,i bought this cd when it came out and was very impressed. but when i saw tree in concert i wasnt impressed but the cd is still hot so i suggest you go and buy it.
5,Life-like costume,Bought this costume for my 4 year-old nephew. He loves it and went immediately into character. The mask is close to his eyes though and bothered him. The costume cannot really be worn as pj's either because of the cape. The costume is easy to slip into and out of.
5,He does not take it off,"My little boy love this out fit! I can't get him to take it off, he sleeps in it plays in it, what else is he going to do in it..."
4,Robin Costume for son,"I bought this for my 5 year old son (wears size 5 - 6). It is a bit long on him (which I expected), but he LOVES this costume. He is a HUGE Robin & Teen Titans fan. Great costume for playing."
4,Great Halloween costume,My son loved his costume He is a size 4T so I had to tuck the legs and sleeves but once on you didn't even notice. I would say it is a size 6 Nice product and great price
3,"Robin's Costume, child size SMALL?","This costume is sized as a child small 4-6. This costume is the largest child small I have every seen. At first we ordered the size below which was too small a 2T-4T. We retuned it and purchased the next size larger. Acutally it ended up beeing 4 or 5 sizes larger. On the bright side, my 3 year old will be able to wear this costume for a long time. We rigged the suit with rubberbands and he loves it! He feels like a real superhero! The Teen Titan cape is really cool and makes the costume look amazing, (it also covers up the rubberbands that are sqeezing handfulls of extra material in the back). One more piece of advice, the mask that came with the child small costume was the same size that came with the toddler costume. Unfortunately both masks are too small for my 3 year old child. We had too purchase another mask separately to complete the costume."
4,Great Costume,My son loves this Robin costume. It fits great and is of good quality. The only downside is that it is hard for him to get ingo and out of by himself because of the tie at the back.
1,I could fit into this SMALL-4/6 costume,"OMG! I purhcased a Robin, size small 4-6 and i swear I can just about fit in it as well!! There is no way this is a small, we are now altering it to fit my son age 5!!! This is what I get for trying out PRIME MEMBERSHIP!"
5,Great customer service,"The seller, CostumeHub is amazingly proud of customer service. There was some misunderstanding in purchasing their product but they solved it right away.Highly recommend this seller."
1,Don't bother ordering this from this vendor...,"Even though they show 7 in stock, at a great price of $5, you get what you pay for. They just send you an email telling you that they don't have it in stock after all.I have a very disappointed 6 year old now...Thanks, Party America!"
3,Cute,"This is a cute costume. My son likes to dress up as superheros all the time. This one is made well enough, and does wash okay. The reason I didn't rate it higher is because who wants to be Robin when you can be Batman? It's a sidekick costume, which means it gets used less."
5,Another Great Work From Willmott,"Though in my opinion it is not quite as good as Empires in the Balance, Willmott produces another fantastic evaluation of Japanese and Allied strategies during in the Pacific War. A must read for the student of the conflict."
3,"Not as good as other ""Unoffical Guides""","This book really wasn't as good as the other ""Unofficial Guides"" I've used. I thought the write ups about the hotels, shows and attractions were pretty good and very readable but there didn't really seem to be much ""insiders"" info. I feel like I could have gotten the write ups about the hotels, etc. from any other of the millions of travel books about LV but I wanted this one because I thought it would give us some inside scoop, which I didn't really feel it did. If you've used ""The Unoffical Guide To Walt Disney World"" you know it has these really great ""touring plans"" that weren't found in this book. It would be a great addition if they would like to make this book more useful."
2,Ick,"We thought we'd like this candy as we've been told they're fabulous. They aren't. The chocolate is chalky, and the fondant is... well fondant... Overly sweetened. Maybe with a better quality chocolate they'd be better but... I won't purchase this again."
2,Didn't like craftsmanship,"Both parts are not symmetrical and locking mechanism is rudimentary,the shipping believe me was not prompt."
4,Melodic & powerful bass&drum-driven power pop!,"Flop's back-to-their-roots follow-up to their glossy Sony/550 release, 'Whenever You're Ready'. Produced by Kurt Bloch (Fastbacks, Young Fresh Fellows), 'World of Today' is powerpop at it's finest; melodic, powerful, at times beautiful, at times a little manic; not dissimilar to the Pixies & Buzzcocks."
5,Smell good,The mother of my kids loves it so I got it for her. Then they say baby daddy are bad lol.
4,Excellent Compilation,"I picked this up on sale and I was glad I did. The remastering on this set is great. It is especially valuable since much of their material is not available at the present time. I would actually rate this 4.5 stars. My only gripe was the omission of some of the better tunes like ""Save The Land"", ""No Lies"", ""TNUC"", ""The Railroad"" and ""In Need"". These songs were omitted in favor of songs on the third disc from their weaker albums. However, it was great to have the unissued songs on this set. Maybe if this set sells well Capitol will get the idea to release the individual albums domestically on cd. If you listened to the radio during the seventies this set will bring back memories. Tunes like ""We're An American Band"", ""I'm Your Captain"", ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"", ""The Loco Motion, ""Bad Time"" etc... It is great to have them all here remastered with some of my favorite cover tunes and album cuts."
4,Well worth the wait,"This 3 cd set is what I've been waiting for.It captures the essence of what Grand Funk was and is a peoples band.These songs cover the entire ""feel' of GF's early R&B soul beginings to a more polished end product.Personally I could have done without the first three songs on disc one from the ""The Pack"",Getting Into The Sun, Can't be To Long,and Got This Thing On The Move.It would've been better to have the Grand Funk versions of these songs.I enjoyed this cd set it's very good and well worth the wait."
3,True long-term fans will love this offering,"Wow, what a collection and to show the extent of their music and years in the limelight...brought back memories and at times an over-abundance of GFR."
5,"If you don't know Funk, then you need to know Funk !","As I sit here and type this, I am listening to the We're An American Band CD, and still sit in awe of the musicianship and the mammoth power that these guys put out. As a child of the seventies, my first taste of this group was a see through gold 45 record of We're an American Band and Creepin on the back side. I was hooked.All of you that don't know Funk, buy this disc, sit back and get to know Funk. Funk lives !Craig WilliamsFarmington, New Mexico"
4,A Good Book,"The Secret Journey is a good book. It is about twelve-year-old Emma Bolton, who lives in England in 1834. Her mother is sick and she and Emma's father are going to France and leaving Emma with Aunt Martha and her hated cousin Odolf. In a desperate attempt to get away from the evil Odolf and go to France with her parents, Emma runs away to the docks of Liverpool and gets onto a ship that she is told is the one her parents are on. Too late, Emma realizes that she is on the wrong boat. She has stowed away on the Black Lightning, a slave ship. She is going to have to go all the way to South Africa and back, disguised as ""William"", the ship's boy. However, about halfway there, the ship sinks in a huge storm. Emma is the only survivor. She is stranded in the jungle of Africa with only chimps to keep her company. Will someone find Emma? Or will she be stuck here forever?"
5,great service,"I needed some replacement spoons for my set due to attrition and couldn't find them (in open stock)anywhere except Amazon. They were priced right and came in 2 or 3 days. This is a very nice, tho traditional, pattern. The brand new ones look like sterling silver compared to the ones I've had for about 10 years. I googled and found you can use vinegar to get out tarnish and make them look bright and shiny, but they still don't look like the new ones."
2,Damaged in shipping,"I paid a small fortune (over $100!) for this ""like-new"" copy of this out-of-print children's book--and yet the seller couldn't be bothered to ship it in anything more than a padded envelope. The book was damaged in shipping--not terribly, but enough to make it certainly look less than ""like-new"". I was disappointed in this seller."
5,A Must Read for all expectant moms,This is a wonderful book to read during pregnancy. I loved it and have already given it as a baby shower gift to a friend. There are so many books about the physical effects of pregnancy that it is overwhelming. I cherished reading this book and exploring the spiritual experience of pregnancy.
3,Puzzled Again,"The movies in this collection are remembered with fondness. However, the DVD doesn't represent them as well as could be expected. The video quality isn't as good as what one usually expects of DVDs.""One Eyed Jacks' is a world famous movie, so one would at least expect nothing unusual, however, along with poor transcription quality, in the middle of the movie, there is a break of about 30 seconds - just long enough to get a viewer to either push buttons on the remote or get up and check the DVD player.The ""Over the Hill Gang"" movies were great fun when originally shown on TV, but this copy is dark enough to make one think all the scenes are at night.Yep, fuzzy and dark is a good description of the quality..."
4,All Good,Everything came as indicated and my son is happy with his gift! The guitar and amp both work and we have enjoyed learning how to play.
3,Boppy Happy 80s Book!,"Well, in the Tradition of Babysitters Club, Sweet Valley Twins and Girl Talk- this is from another of the lesser known 1980s series for pre-teen girls. The story is basically just the diary of a young girl named Liz, living in a happy-joy joy household, with parents who never raise their voices, with a best friend just down the street... 'The Party', the first book in the series, tells of how Elizabeth wishes to win popularity at school, and invites the 'cool' group to a Slumber Party- but later finds out that she was better with her own friends afterall. I have a special place for books like this though, as I was a 'child of the 80s'... and you've gotta love the innocence of stories like these! =)"
3,Ethics and the Sociology of Morals,Perhaps something was lost in translation. I don't know what I expected but I have not gotten very far into reading this book andI probably will not.
5,Caroline B. Cooney captures the attention of teen readers,I have been reading Cooney's books for a long time now. I really enjoy reading her books becuase teens of any age can relate to them. I hope that she wil continue to write more books so that more teens can get the chance to read such great books.
5,sleeper,"after getting jewelz i realized how great OC is and wanted more. i finally got word..life and no doubt its a classic. not as good as illmatic which is one of the greatest ever but nonetheless, a tight disc. i'd compare it more to ""lifestyles of the da poor and dangerous"" by Big L with the raw production and such dark lyrics as in ""story"". OC is definetely slept on though, and i just don't understand how an MC as good as he is can be so underground and unheard of. if you got the spare money or can get it any other way, buy it, but until then definetely get jewelz which i almost think is better. cant hate on primo, the best."
4,Very nice solo debut from O.C.,"O.C. drops a very solid solo debut, close to 4.5 stars. This is his 3rd solo album I have and just as good as ""Jewelz"" (also close to 4.5 stars) and his ""Bon Appetit"" is worth 3.5 stars, ans I still haven't check out his ""Smoke & Mirrors"" album. With 14 songs (1 is a remix), you get 2 ok songs and the other 12 are good, a few being real good. There are no guests just O.C. on every song. Production is nice as well handled mostly bu the D.I.T.C. crew. Buckwild does 9 songs, Organized Konfusion and DJ Ogee each do 2 and Lord Finesse does 1 song. A nice album to have form an overlooked and underrated MC.#1 - 7#2 - 8.5#3 - 8.5#4 - 9.5 (nice beat)#5 - 8.5 (good beat)#6 - 8.5 (nice beat)#7 - 9 (nice beat again)#8 - 8.5#9 - 7#10- 8.5#11 - 8#12 - 8.5#13 - 8#14 - 8.5 (remix of #4)Omar Credle -- b. 5/13/71 -- b.

3,Decent-some great-leftovers.,"I love OTR. A supremely talented band who insist on doing things their way. BESIDES includes numerous b-sides (ha ha, get it?). Some are ok, some are better, and some are outstanding, in the following order:The OK's:An American DJPolish DJHej (I Do)The Better's:My Love Is a FeverThe People Here Are Not ShyWithin Without (nice 'rusty' sounding guitars!)Last NightLucyAnd the Outstanding's:MurderDead Weight (what a song!)Bothered (frighteningly fragile and beautiful-best song on the cd)All I Need Is EverythingMilesIf I'm Drowning (fourteen minutes!!)Not bad as far as leftover albums go. The great stuff is quintessential OTR-not to be missed. A good companion to the full OTR collection."
2,Pretty stupid,"If you need esoteric knowledge just read Helena Blavatsky ""The Secret Doctrine"". At least it will not pretend it has ""scientific basis"" but will say the same things (and I'm sure this ""theosophy"" is just based on it) and besides them you can find there much much more good knowledge and it is more integral for someone who seeks for the Answer"
3,"So bad,it's good?? It's true!!","I first saw this movie by way of MST3K and I couldn't believe how silly and funny it was-unintentionally so,of course.There are no top-notch actors in this,but plenty of bad effects though..No budget,bad acting,bad dialogue,zero effects-everything you want in a bad movie!! Recommended for lovers of bad movies...See the MST3K version first,if you can,then get this..."
1,Why is there no zero rating,"Why? What did we do to deserve this movie? This is without a doubt one of the most pointless pieces of drivel ever to hit the video store shelves. Why did they get on a train and abandon their friends with a dinosaur? Who knows? Did the train just go in a circle and take them back to where they lived? I guess. Why did the cops pick them up? Who cares? This movie was so bad I almost had an aneurysm. Please by no circumstances ever even think about watching this ""movie"". Unless it's on MST3K then, of course, it's hilarious. This movie is so bad I found myself adding in riffs that Mike and the `bots missed. Oh - a little bonus tip if you do buy this thing for some reason: save the box and make your own set just like in the film. Buy a $.99 rubber dinosaur and a pack of M-80s and you can make the sequel."
2,So THAT'S what happened to the dinosaurs...,"What can you say about a movie that features dinosaurs on a string, 1000 empty boxes and Z'Dar's chin? Only that Ed Wood would have been proud! Note: The star rating is this high only because I saw it on MST3K. Don't think I could have finished watching this flick without Mike, Crow and Servo."
2,"Man, machine and monsters erupt in brutal combat","The stage is set when a slave from a distant world (Bernhardt) escapes from his cyborg captors and lands in a place he calls Heaven, but we know it as Earth. His freedom is short-lived when a relentless cyborg hunter (Robert Z'Dar) stops at nothing to track him down."
1,Who would pay 50.99 for this piece of s*it,"I have a theory about this movie. Someone secretly got a hold of Jean Claude Van Damme's DNA, and decided to clone him. The result is our hero in this piece of dreck. A prostitute that becomes a nun, dinosaurs with exploding neck collars (to quote Tom Servo, ""So that's how the dinosaurs became extinct."") and a feeling that this was filmed from a script written by Ed D. Wood Jr."
1,Pure 100% USDA Craporama!,"I just saw it today on MST3K. That pretty much says it all. Made on a budget of about $36.52, this movie looks like a couple junior-college kids filmed it with their parent's 8mm camera. Kudos on the special effects used to create the dinosaurs (I'm guessing Play-Dough Fun Factory). With Mike Nelson, Crow & Tom Servo at the bottom of the screen, it's a masterpiece."
1,Crummy - Reprehensible - Abhorrent - Purile,As you can tell from the other interviews this movie is just about the worst film ever made. Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it:Boring - Unbearable - Laughable - LousyStupid - Horrible - Insipid - TerribleI could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point.Daniel Bernhardt is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out. I see that he is going to be in both MATRIX sequels. While I loved the MATRIX I now have serious doubts as to the quality of the sequel.I wouldn't watch this film voluntarily but I may make my kids watch it the next time I need to punish them.
5,one of the worst movies i've ever seen--i love it!,"if i had more money, i'd buy the unMSTed version of this movie. i think it's one of my favorite movies that MST3K ever did, but of my least favorite episodes. mike and the bots are not in top form on this one. the movie is great though. travis brooks stewart is awesome. the whole prostitute-turned-nun subplot was great. the music is really cool too. gratuitous voice-overs, plastic dinosaurs, what more do you want?"
1,"Thank you, MST3K","I saw this piece of drek on MST3K, and believe me, I wouldn't have been able to sit through it without Mike and the bots. A skinny Belgian idiot escapes from his futuristic cardboard spaceship and is hunted down by some plastic dinosaurs. Throw in an ex-hooker turned nun, a halfway house run by huge guys, and some cheap sets that look like they were borrowed from the local community playhouse and you have one the most awful movies ever to hit the made-for-video market. Did I mention that the movie does not take place in the future and it's not about a war?"
5,Music Made It!,This was awesome mix of teen drama and music that was perfectly placed. The music made this movie for me and also the enduring troubled characters.It was fun with drama placed in the appropriate places. It was just an enjoyable fun way to spend some time.Only problem I had was the added scences did not add anything to the original release.
5,THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!,"This is totally one of my fave movies of all time! It's so funny, and I totally love Mark! Ethan Embry--or Randall, at the time, is one of my 2 fave actors and Mark is the coolest guy ever! He's awesome! SHOPLIIIFFFTERRR! I seriously reccomend thid movie to all of my fellow teenagers!! And as for all you old people who keep sayin this movie sucks--keep your mouth shut. This is a happy nice movie and the youth of america just happens to love it. And seeing as how your old and all, you just cant relate. Well, if you havent see this movie--see it! And if you have--see it again! ROCK!"
3,Strangely appealing except for...,"I do not know why I like this movie. I am not a fan of a lot of the music they play in it and the story is rather paper-thin. However, there is something attractive about the interactions between all the characters and how they work out their problems.The 2 reasons I did not give this movie 5 stars are:1. Robin Tunney as Deb. This was the most annoying character I have ever encountered. She is pretentious and snotty -- and not in a way that makes sense or is tolerable.2. The actor who played Warren...how did that kid every land acting jobs? I saw him in one other movie and he was terrible there too.Both of these characters were too annoying to be liked or sympathized with so I just kept rolling my eyes while they were on screen.Everyone else was great!"
3,Cult classic (but not for me),"This one came out when I was young enough to be considered the *target audience.* I missed it at the time, but always wanted to see it because of its inexplicable appeal (could just be Liv Tyler's mini skirt, haha).I'm sorry to say but I wasn't as entertained as I thought I would. My days of chuckling over nonsensical jokes are over, I guess. As with most teen movie classics, I feel the only genuine appeal is sharing the moment of time that you and the characters have shared. Although there are interesting characters in the movie, I feel the development of story isn't elaborate enough to appreciate them.Yet it doesn't really matter. Before the days of iPod and MP3s, working at a record store was indeed one of the coolest jobs for the youth, and I was reminded of that time of my days at least. And for some, that's enough to call a movie classic."
2,A soundtrack without a movie.,"Ironically, I was working in a music store when this film's soundtrack was released. The funny thing was the soundtrack was not released in conjunction with film. As a matter of fact, I do not believe this movie was ever released in theaters. Why? Was the movie so bad that the studio had no faith in it for a theatrical release? My store got stuck with alot of soundtracks for a movie no one was able to see. It seems that the studio had more confidence in the soundtrack than the movie.I saw it on cable a year or two later, and it was essentially a movie built around a soundtrack. A shallow story revovling around an allegedly hip soundtrack. It was not as wretchedly awful as I had feared, but still it was just a mild piece of teenage angst fluff with actors who looked like they stepped out of a Noxema ad."
5,Best Acted Film Ever Made!,"This is the best acted movie you'll ever see. With the likes of Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, Liv Tyler, Robin Tunney, Renee Zellweger, and Ethan Embry, you can't ask for any better young actors. Aside from well acting, the film is hilarious, very well-written, and directed brilliantly. If you're under 40 you must see this film for the nostalgia. It is so true to life. All of it rocks, but the ending's so cool and also Johnny and Liv make the raddest couple. Go see it now!"
2,SAY NOMORE THIS MOVIES A BORE,"ok, so its entertaining, I'll give it that but the movie lacks in several categories. The brain dead plot really sticks to your teeth like peanut butter. Annoying Liv was annoying and a lot of the other ""generation-x"" kids are just a bunch of try-hard losers."
2,Melodrama Abounds,"This was much better off as a fond memory; digging it out of the archives for a modern viewing just made me question my younger self's judgment. A storeful of vapid, self-absorbed caricatures come together to hawk records, listen to radio-friendly '90s mush and reveal just how shallow they truly are as a collective. Very young Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger show some skin and look good doing it, but that's pretty much the only highlight. Whoever chose the soundtrack for this needs to be deafened for the good of all mankind - for a store that's supposed to be all about the anti-establishment, it's got very bland, mainstream tastes."
5,AMAZING,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time. It isn't just some stupid teen movie, but a great comedy that tells the lives of very different people who all have one thing in common, they work for a record store called EMPIRE RECORDS! The DVD is great and the additional footage is to die for. You won't be disappointed."
5,Oh come on...it's a great movie,"Okay, so if you are hitting 40 you may not find amusement in this movie, and I am sure it's intentions were not to stimulate mind growth. Honestly, if you are a teenager, or maybe even in your twenties and are going through an identity crisis or remember when Sinnead O'Connor was the big gasp, then you will find this hysterical. This is one of my all time favorite movies. Maybe because it reminds me of my friends and I, or maybe because it is like the place I work in, but I saw the movie when it came out and still find it just as funny as the first time. I give it 5 stars, for it hits the audience that it aims at well!"
5,grab it while you can,"If you loved The Breakfast Club you'll love Empire Records. I discovered it whilst watching television in the early hours of the morning and have loved it ever sinse. The film is comical and realistic, so true to teenagers that if your past 22 it is likely u wont enjoy it.The film laucnched the carreers of Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger who were both unheard of at the time of its realease..and have gone on to become leading actresses of today. Apparently the film is not being produced anymore..so grab it while you can. It sums up youth and in the period of a day with plenty of laughs and a simple narrative structure."
4,Fun---Don't take it SERIOUSLY!,"No, this movie isn't exactly realistic, but it is really, really fun to watch. Older people (at least those upwards of 30) seem to hate it. Maybe they are bitter that their own teenage years weren't so wild and crazy. But for teenage girls who aren't into, say, the Backstreet Boys, this movie is the ultimate. Don't believe me? Check out the dozens of websites devoted to this movie. It's funny, it's somewhat original and you will be repeating the lines over and over. Yes, Pump Up the Volume actually had a message, Empire does not, and don't look for one. Look for Ethan Embry being insane, look for Rory Cochrane being hilarious. Look for record store workers dancing around to weird, fun music. They do that a lot."
5,It's a MUST see!,"I can't beleive I hadn't seen this movie untill yesterday. Itsa hularious movie about a group of teens that work in a music storeand how they have to save it. It has a little bit of romance, serious life incounters/problems, and a LOT of laughs. I recommend it for anyone that is ina good mood for a fantastic comedy and atleast 13 years old."
3,empire records,"here's the thing: empire records is not a very good movie. actually, it's a pretty bad movie. it lacks focus due to an overload of characters, a directionless script that branches off so many times it never ties up all of its loose ends, and liv tyler's ""acting."" so why do i find myself coming back to this movie? because i'm a music geek. the store is like a dream world for any vinyl- and indie-obsessed person like me, the characters become best friends, and the soundtrack absolutely rocks. but that's about the only reason anyone could survive this film. for the casual music fan who would like a story with their movie, you might be more comfortable with my personal favorite movie, high fidelity."
3,Not bad...thats about it,"Empire Records lacked something. It starts off slow and doesn't get moving for a while, just sort of coasts along. There are plenty of characters to relate to, almost too many it seemed at points. The people themselves were plenty interesting and well scripted, but enough already...too many little side stories that took away from the main plot.Do any of these people actually work? Everyones either in the back room or dancing around the store while the occasional misfit mans the register. The interaction with the store was pretty fun though, and the movie in general was mildly entertaining, but I felt like there was so much more potential for this thing to rock.Basically, there was a bunch of good bases for story lines and they all diluted one another to the point of mediocrity. Some people will still love this film anyways, especially highschool/college students, so check it out anyways and see what you think."
5,"A great movie, for anyone who like ""The Breakfast Club"".","A movie that you'll want to see again and again...the perfect gift for anyone who liked ""The Breakfast Club"". About a group of ambitious young people who work at a Record store. It stars ""Armegeddon""'s Liv Tyler, and ""Jerry Mcguire"" and ""One True Thing""'s Renee Zellwegger. It is funny, emotional, and provocative, with a soundtrack that anyone who likes rock will love! But be careful, because once you see this movie, you may never want to stop watching it! Thanx!"
5,Absolutely Fun!,"A great kick-back, don't-think-too-hard, enjoy-the-movie kind of movie! Great acting all around, and you get to see some of todays stars getting their start."
4,"Great Comedy, uniquely cool!","This movie is great for older veiwers.Displaying the struggles of various teens with various problems , it explains a lot! It allows drug problems criminal, emotional and finacial problems to be comprehensible through each character. END"
5,These movie deserves a lot more recognition than it got.,"""You see Mark music is the glue of the world, its what holds everything together."" Are you kidding this movie is awesome. SHOPLIFTER!!! Mark rocks hes so funny. And Empire Records is so cool I laugh when ever I think about it.DAMN THE MAN SAVE THE EMPIRE!!!"
5,This Is the one of the BEST teen movies,This is my favorite movie. I just can't get enough of it. The music is great. The characters are funny. The plot is good. BUY THIS MOVIE!!
5,Timely,I was super happy with how fast this arrived and it was in excellent shape. I've watched it almost a dozen times already.
5,THIS MOVIE KICKS ...,"IF YOU EVER COME ACROSS THIS MOVIES I SUGGEST YOU GET IT. IF YOU LIKED THE BREAKFAST CLUB, HIGH FIDELITY OR DAZED AND CONFUSED YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. AT FIRST WHEN I SAW THE MOVIE IN A BLOCKBUSTER I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD MOVIE THEN IT WAS ON THE MOVIE CHANNEL AND I WATCHED IT AND IT IS THE BEST TEEN MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED IT HAS SOME VERY CUTE GUYS IN IT AND A KILLER SOUNDTRACK ALTHOUGH SOME SONGS WEREN'T ON THE CD THAT WERE IN THE MOVIE. ANYWAY THE MOVIE IS AWESOME SO EITHER BUY IT OR RENT IT."
1,This isn't a good movie,"I remembered this movie being good so i bought it... well apparently, when i was six years younger, my taste wasn't as keen as it is today. the plot is terrible, the lines are terrible, and the actors can't salvage it... there is some music in it... which is the best part. don't buy this. take mine if you want it"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A pretty terrible movie in which ludicrously unrealistic characters go through the motions of learning about themselves, Empire Records is only worth watching if you want a slice of mid-90s nostalgia."
1,Made me feel physically sick,"Just what we all needed, an angst ridden story of a bunch of ever-so-misunderstood American teens, after all that's never been done before. So disgusted was I that I wanted to vomit bile all over the screen. Particularly when the blonde girl started singing on top of the record shop. Save me, save me from this horrible horrible film. Not funny Not clever Not good in the slightest."
1,Empire Records is an Empire TURKEY!,"It's very rare that a movie nausiates me as much as this one.I tried very eagerly to find a plot in this ""epic"", but all I found was a group of whiney losers (who can't act their way out of a box) who complain about their terrrrrible lives.I should've known that it was horrible from the back of the case:""A Killer Soundtrack"". What about a storyline? It takes place over about a 3 hour period (except for the first scene) and nothing really happens except a manic depressant cuts her hair, the store gets ""robbed"" and some guy loses money.Big whoop!Oh, it also has Liv Tyler in it...need I say more? It wouldn't let me leave the rating at 0 stars...but believe me...1 star is a travesty to the way I would REALLY rate this."
1,Unbelivable and stupid!,"Why did so many people like this film? I thought it was incredibly bad! why do we need to glorify kids who work in record stores, when that is where you usually get the worst customer service? Really stupid situations here...like when they all have a fake funeral for a depressed girl..and i mean they ALL do, so who is minding the store? The dumbest part was when a middle aged women UPS worker dances her way out of the store to alternative rock (something not right here)..and then we see some ballet dancer doing her thing at the listening station... i guess we are supposed to howl with laughter when we see two old ladies in their nightgowns and curlers in their hair show up to chug beer!! (COME ON!!) Oh yeah...everybody loves record store employees..they are the coolest people in the world! (online record stores are fine:-) )"
5,An Excelent Movie,"This is a very twisted movie, it is played though the minds of several teenagers trying to save their beloved record store. In the midst of it all, something big is happening in each persons life. One is in love, one is in a crisis, and it weaves a tapestry of wonderess and a hilarias plot. This is an excelent movie."
3,"It's a funny thing, but...","This isn't the sort of thing you admit liking in public, unless you're out on holiday with the girly-girl fan-club. One word.Cute.In a way, it's a shame that this is SO cute... you've gotta have you're cute, misunderstood, love-stuck artist, you're straight-laced study-hard beauty with pill poppin' problem, you're loveable slut who wants to sing, the slap-head suicidal girl who really just wants people to respect her... I could go on.My point is that it is too damn cute, and you miss some BRILLIANT writing in it. Most of them come from Rory Cochrane's Lucas. The ""funky"" youth music is maybe a little overused, but Empire Records isn't really something you gotta analyse the crap out of. It's very old-fashioned in it's approach (Let's raise money to save the Record Shop and have a happy ending - actually, didn't Wayne's World parody this sorta thing?) but it's reassuring.Better than you'd give it credit for, but maybe too neat to be a classic?"
5,Classic Teen Movie,"Empire Records is one of those movies that never gets ""played out"". It has a fresh, youthful, captivating flow. Set to great music from a mix of genres. This is definitely not just a music video. It deals with a lot of basic life issues, that are part of growing up and growing old. From the little miss perfect, who secretly pops pills to keep up. And is holding onto a teen fantasy of losing her virginity in romance novel style to her heart throb. The weird girl working through depression and thoughts of suicide. A wanna be thug and miserably bad shoplifter that just needs to belong to something. To the washed up old pop star that tries to pathetically hold onto his youth and career. And a wealth of other colorful characters, that are all trying to find themselves, and where they fit into the world. Empire is a great light hearted movie. It doesn't go overboard with drama, romance, or silliness. But it does have a little bit of all those things."
2,Best tell your teenager you liked it,"If you are a parent, you may find that your kids enjoying a hormone charged, somewhat slacker prone group of teenagers navigate life to be a bit distressing. My teenage kids loved this movie, probably for the same reasons it was distressing to the adults. I think this is a great film for teenagers to watch - by themselves - or with parents still connected to their adolescence."
2,NICE,TIS WAS A FUNNY AZ WHITE PPL MOVIE WIT SUM FINE AZ WHITE GIRLS IN IT IT REMIND ME OF THE MOVIE WHEN MEET THE PARENTS FOOL WAS A FRUIT
1,The absolute worst movie I have ever seen (including Plan 9),"An awful movie with no substance. An excuse for MTV to release an infomercial on what the kids should be listening to. I have honestly seen pornos with a better storyline, and it doesn't even deserve the one-star rating, but there was no option for 0 stars. After being a key player in Dazed & Confused, and Love & A .45, what was Rory Cochrane thinking when he accepted this role?"
5,shya,"i saw this movie for the first time 3 years ago and it is still like my favorite movie. i know all the songs featured and can practically recite the whole movie. i love it, and it's my fault all my friends love it too! it's great, it absolutely rocks"
5,This is a hilarious movie. I love it!,"Empire Records is a great movie that hasn't gotten the credit it deserves. The movie was definatly aimed towards teenagers, but even my mum loves it! Anyone who hasn't seen Empire Records needs to buy it right now! You won't regret it! DAMN THE MAN! SAVE THE EMPIRE!!!"
3,"A Great Movie, An Awful Edition","If you're a fan of the movie or watching it for the first time, do yourself a favour and get the ORIGINAL, not the special fan edition. The added scenes were originally cut for a reason - they don't add anything to the movie, other favourite lines were changed, and important ones left out. This is definitely not the edition that this fan wanted."
4,Damn the man! Save the Empire!,"Great 90's flick about colorful mix of kids working at a record store. Check out Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger before they became hugely famous. You'll watch the movie going ""where have I seen that actor/actress before?"". The soundtrack is rocking and everyone can identify with one (or more) of the characters. Buy this movie!"
5,My guilty pleasure,"I can't explain it to you, you wouldn't understand. How can you emphasize that something strikes a resonnating chord with a distant memory of a cherished job? Don't buy it unless you've seen it. And ""No"" you can't borrow my copy."
1,Horrible!,"I bought this new version thinking it would be even better than the first version (which I loved), but I was proven wrong. This version is absolutly horrible! There are very unnessicary voice overs, for instance, when ""Warren"" came back to the store and said to stop calling him Warren, when they showed Eddie, Cory, Berko, and Mark, this scene shows a PERFECT example of not only an unnessicary voice over, but very poorly made voice over. They didn't even re-shoot that scene, they just voiced it over. I was VERY dissappointed with this version and I recomend the first version."
2,Not impressed.,"I loved SG and I bought this cd way back closer to it's release date... the remixes are ok but these songs have been mixed so many times (on other imported cds that) it's not new or interesting anymore. HOWEVER, if you're a die-hard fan (or haven't bought the imported cds yet), you'll probably want it anyway. (just like I did)I hated the rather high price for the short track listing and I personally would rather hear the debut, affirmation or ANY OTHER SG album over this one.Bottom line, I would say this album is most certainly NOT worth the price but if you love SG and want ALL their albums... buy it used."
4,Wind softened tracks . . .,"I ordered this book before it was published because I am a woman tracker too . . and her tracking interludes in the book are facinating to me . . but the rest of the book made me wonder if you can add domestic violence to any subject and get it published as that's such a trendy subject.. Also the book left many many questions. Was it fiction or autobiographical? It never says anywhere. She talks about studying tracking in Africa . . briefly, too briefly. For those of us who track it was like finding the subjects tracks lightly etched on the trail . . .just as the wind picks up. I hope she picks up her subject again from the dust particles and fills in the trail."
3,Enjoyed this book,"The author is successful at depicting an abusive relationship and it was helpful to me to understand why a person would stay in such a marriage. The concept was intriguing as well and I enjoyed learning something about tracking. I began to lose interest in the tracking side of the story, however, in the middle part of the book. It seemed to be a little repetitive and too many of the passages read like a freshmen composition on tracking. The action sequences that dealt with tracking were exciting and fun to read. Good luck to the author in the future."
5,Fun DVD,"These Barbie movies are all really great. My kids love watching then (even my 5 yr old son, although you could never get him to admit it.)"
5,Daughter loves it,My 5 year old daughter loves it. She watches it quite frequently. The songs are not annoying. The animation is perfect for what it is.I see some other reviews stating that there is a similar barbie movie. That doesn't bother us since we don't have that one.
1,gohastings.com Sucks,"this was a Christmas gift for my daughter. So i wrapped it and gave it to her Christmas morning. Put it in the DVD player only to find out it will not work.GOHASTINGS.com will not return it or replace it bc it is past their 30 day period.So a little girl is sad bc Santa got her a movie that does not work.I went to the store and replaced it, but thats not the point.gohastings.com SUCKS."
2,nothing new,"I have all the Barbie movies for my grandgirls - they love 'em and they did like this one too....but their mom and I didn't - it's unfortunate because whoever makes these movies...just recycled this one...they took other songs from other movies and redid them....which is fine to an extent...basically the whole premise was copied, there wasn't anything new about it - I know the movies are made for little girls...but they don't understand what a rip-off is and maybe that's a good thing for now - just don't like paying full price for something that was being ripped off. Both of the stars in the movie had magical items....hairbrush and microphone...I don't recall anything in the movie explaining how that came to be, it just was - unlike the other Barbie movies, they usually did a great job in weaving that into the story lines - this one didn't. Oh well, like I said, the girls liked the movie."
5,"Cute, cute, cute","well, it was only fitting to get this DVD. We own EVERY SINGLE BARBIE DVD. It's an addiction at our house! Good movies with positive messages and crazy catchy songs that we grown-ups find ourselves singing with our daughters.So this movie, princess and the popstar, is as you guess, like princess in the pauper. SPOILER ALERT: they switch places...I am SURE you are shocked. Nevertheless, it is cute and I can't wait until Feb 2013 when the Pink Shoes movie comes out - I MEAN, my kids can't wait (whatever, I'll totally watch it with them!!!)"
4,looking forward to seeing it,haven't see it yet but look forward to opening it soon :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
5,Awesome video!!,"Bought this for my 4 year old daughter, as she's obsessed with princesses. She LOVES this movie. The most surprising thing, however, is that her twin brother asks for it more than she does! He is autistic and VERY musically inclined, so the musical numbers really appeal to him. He also thinks certain parts are just hilarious - I mean full on belly laughs from this adorable kid. :-) I've got video of he and his sister copying the dance moves, too! I've even caught myself humming these songs at work. :-) I would highly recommend this movie. It's fun, colorful and teaches a few life lessons. Great for kids."
4,like it,My 4 year old daughter loves this movie. She loves the music. She got this movie for Christmas and has watched it at least 4 times already!
3,My daughter likes this,"but I am not crazy about it. I don't like the message it sends to young girls. You just have to find a balance between letting your children enjoy the movies that their peers enjoy, while at the same time stressing that there are/will be more opportunities in life than being either a Princess or a Popstar, both virtually impossible options for the vast majority of young girls. (We can't say totally impossible, because look at the Duchess of Cambridge., or any of the young Nickelodeon or Disney teen stars.)"
5,quickly received and perfect product!,"my 4 year old daughter LOVES this movie!beautiful packaginggreat qualityarrived promptlyif you like barbie movies, this is a fun one."
5,These are great girl movies,I have 6 daughters who have grown up watching all these movies. I own every single one and have enjoyed watching them with them. They don't drive me crazy like others do. This one had music that has been in other movies but it was fun for my girls.
2,Deja Vu,I think Barbie has run out of ideas. The story is just like their Princess and Pauper even some of the songs have the same tune! I prefer the original...
5,The kids just loved it!,"The kids loved the movie, the only thing is that it took ages to arrive but it was the stipulated time..."
4,Kids love it!,"My girls love this movie. The story is beyond stupid, but it appeals to kids and keeps them entertained and that's all that matters."
5,Great Kids Video,Graphics are excellent and storyline is good. Not recommended for very young children. Storyline is more of an adult topic and should be screened by parents.
4,Cute!,"This was a cute movie, graphics are wonderful. My only issue with it was that they re-used some of the songs from older Barbie movies. The new ""To be a princess"" song was cute, and the story was a bit original though very similar to Princess and the Pauper, except the bad guy in this one is not royalty, so that was a definite twist. Cute, yes. Worth $15, yes. Although not my favorite of the Barbie movies, the kids really like it!"
1,Are you kidding me? A copy of Princess and the Pauper!,"I cannot believe the gall of the creators / ""writers"" of this new film. This film contains several songs from other Barbie films, inclusive of Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper, but even worse, it is almost a total copy of the storyline from Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper. The renditions of the loosely adapted ""To Be a Princess..."" and other copied songs from other films are so much worse in this film! Buy Barbie: The Princess and the Pauper and pass on this hacked film! Shame on them!!"
5,A Happy Girl,It's a typical Barbie movie so mom and dad are not thrilled but if you are a 6 year old girl it's the best movie ever. :)
4,daughers love it,cute barbie movie. little over the top in spots but 4 year old especially loves it. kept her entertained on recent car trip
4,Haven't watched it yet,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas and because of that reason we haven't watched it yet. I'm sure they will like it, but not quite sure if they will (which is the only reason for 4 stars)."
1,No pearl luster - More like glass bead shine,"The pearls had no luster, more uniform black. I have black glass bead earrings, these looked just like them. Do not let the picture fool you. I had filled out the return form within a few minutes of opening the box. Very disappointed."
2,black pearls,Appeared to be very nice on arrival. But the fell apart after wearing them only twice. Would not buy again.
5,Very nice!,"Love the smell, and cleans nice.My skin is soft, silky and clean.Its a great gentle cleanser for face and body!Love it!"
2,BAD taste.,This stuff tastes really bad. It does warm - but loses the warming FAST. I would not purchase this again.
2,Devil's Angel's Sound Track,I'm lookeing for the devil's angel's sound track. I would like to have the CD.
5,Kaksi kimentä Kaksi,"Don't know exactly, how 22 is pronounced in finnish langidge, but I know how it feels, when you listen to this great combo from the high north. They developped from record to record, never lost their own style and finally released their best album ""rally of love"" some time ago. the ""Bare Bone"" album is a bit more trashy and doesn't have much of a real pop album (I love strange pop albums!!!), but when you like one pistepirkko song and think it to be ""poppy"", I am sure, you will love to hear all those others."
3,In response to another reviewer,"In response to another reviewer: Of course the average Japanese has a hard time understanding the specialized vocabulary and concepts of this rather literal translation. His culture is telling him very different things than what the Bible teaches and he is not familiar with the history and culture of the Bible.This translation (ISBN#4820212117) is the New Interconfessional (Shin Kyodoyaku) produced by the Japan Bible Society in cooperation with the Roman Catholic Church in Japan. It is used in most main-line Protestant churches and Catholic churches in Japan. If you want an easy-to-understand version for the man on the street, try the Japanese Living Bible. And, Oh Yes, there IS a manga Bible. See the Manga Bible Story-Japanese."
5,great,"even better than i thought - it is softcover, but a very nice softcover (in typical softcover bible style), and has a much nicer appearance than the cover art image would lead you to believe. i tried to research quite a lot before buying, in order to find a good catholic bible in japanese, and this seems to be the one to get (at least if you're overseas). recommended."
5,lip saver,I always dreaded playing my trumpet after carrying it in my car in cold weather. The metal mouthpiece was cold and took time to warm. This mouthpiece is a warm welcome on a cold day. It seems that my lip does not get tired as quickly. I bought one for my grandson. He likes it for the same reason. Lots of people comment on a mouthpiece you can see threw. It would be great for trumpeters in a marching band on a cold day. I'd recommend it. Larry Yeagley lry363w@cox.net
4,Very Good Microwave!,"We've had this unit for several months now, and I see why people talk about the user friendliness of Sharp Microwaves. Everything is easy and obvious except lowering the power setting. That stumped me until I broke out the manual. Now I like the way that works, too.The unit has more power than we need and a surprising amount of room inside. My only critique is that the display is black lettering on white background with no backlight. It is hard to read, sometimes."
4,Great microwave,"I purchased this microwave to replace and old 800 watt Sharp that the buttons stopped working on. I had my old one for six or seven years and was happy with it, so I upgraded to this model. It is slightly bigger (20 inches wide versus 17) and more powerful than the older model. It heats my food evenly. The timing per instructions on the packages are right on. I find that it is a bit noisier and the ""menu"" of buttons take up more room than the older model, hence the 4 star rating. Overall, I am very happy with it so far."
1,Broke down in less than 2 years,"Bought it less than 2 years back. Stopped working a week back. Called up Sharp USA and they said that without the extended warranty, they will only cover the replacement parts cost of the magnetron tube. Even with that, the labor charge etc will add up to $70. I might as well buy a new one. I also enquired with a local sharp authorized repair shop and he said that they charge $25 for evaluating the problem and another $45 minimum for labor cost plus any other parts cost.I ended up throwing out the R-308KW and buying a new one."
4,Great Microwave for the Money!,"I bought this microwave about three months ago. So far it is working fine. I like the power and the size of the heating chamber. The door is a little noisy when you close it. Its predecessor, similar brand and size, died after only one year from purchase. I replaced it with this one because of color and cabinet space limitations."
3,Purchased as gift,The original arrived damaged. It was replaced by the shipper. I have not seen the product. The recipients told me that the replacement works fine.
4,fit perfect,Replaced both sides and this was same grade as OE. The ones I pulled off were falling apart so these were an upgrade so to say.
4,Very useful for ESL students,"As a teacher with 90% of ESL students in my class, I found this book to be very useful. It's packed with links,short poems and ideas that are easy to set up. My 1st graders like to use the charts alone, as review materials, while I work with less adevanced students. A book I use a lot!"
1,Disappointed,"The cover of the book looks like there are many wonderful ideas and activities. However, there are black and white masters and more writing for the teachers than hands-on activities for the students. Making these activities will take a lot more work than I anticipated."
3,wrong color,my husband bought me the calculator and we pick it out together. But when i recieved it is wasn't the baby pink that the picture showed. Its darker. I haven't opened it yet because i'm not sure if i want to keep it only because i was expecting to receive what i saw.
2,texas instruments ti-84 (pink),The product advertised is not the pink TI-84 on sale in other websites. The product I received has only a pink front and the rest of the calculator is gray. That is not explained on the advertisement. I payed extra for a pink calculator that is not what was delivered to me.
2,Had a lot of problems with this order...,"It came and it was supposed to be pink, but it was gray, with a pink cover. The seller quickly sent the pink face plate so all was good...until my daughter took it to school for the first day, It didn't work! It would barely turn on! then nothing. So as all the other kids are programming their calculators she is messing with replacement batteries trying to get it to work. The seller has promised to make it right and is promising a replacement or a refund. So we are waiting for the replacement. The sellers have been responsive, definitely."
4,Fabulous Calculator,"I love it! All the features I need, plus it's super cute. I even dropped it once and there was no sign of any damage, not even a scratch."
4,cool calculator,"I needed a graphing calculator for my Intermediate Algebra class I'm taking. All the ones that were at the store were boring colors so I decided to get one online so I could have a color of my choice. It's much darker pink than the picture portrays, but still prettier than the ones in the store. :)"
3,Not what I expected.,"Some of the buttons don't work properly, & the calculator isn't as updated as I thought. The up arrow doesn't do its job."
2,I didnt relaize refurbished meant really old and so I think the price was too much,The item price was too much for a refurbished caculator I was under the impression that it was like new but Im learning my lost
4,Good,"It's a good calculator but i didn't get the pink one shown in the picture, i got a dark pink calculator. It's not easy to use, you have to learn first, even tough it's a cute calculator for women.Amazon should make clear that they won't deliver the bright pink shown."
5,free jazz goodness...,"...ok, it's not free jazz in the true sense of the traditional Ornette Coleman etc... but if you're familiar with Chicago ""post-rock"" (blah) stuff, then you know what I mean. This is live stuff that has been remixed etc by casey rice and bundy brown..."
4,pretty good. i must say.....,".....i bought this cd in hopes that it would sound familiar to the unstable molecule. however, it's very much different than that album. this cd seems to be very much further out there than the other music i've heard from these guys. i am nonetheless very happy with this cd and glad i purchased it. there are only two songs on this album, but who cares. the first song is about 12 minutes long with a kaleidoscope of sounds ranging from electronic casio keyboard effects to very deep free-jazz sounds. there are plenty of good beats to keep the interest as well. never is there a dull moment on this short but sweet cd. definately worth having in your collection. i gave it four stars because i save those for cd's i want to hear again right after i'm done. i'll listen to this again tomorrow....."
1,Sold incorrect product by seller. Did not respond to my inquiry!,"This is the product I ordered but I was sent children's spray SPF 25, something not for adult daily use on the face.The seller ignored my responses about incorrect product shipped."
5,Review ofJumbo Checker Rug Game,"The checkers came just in time for Christmas. My two grandsons, 3 and 6, have it all figured out, and they love it. They do not have a TV, and they are so open to games they can play together. JUST PERFECT."
3,"Fun, but a bit big","A little tough to little people to move the pieces without crawling on it, and storage could be better. We generally stack all the checkers together, then wrap them up in the mat, and tie the roll together with some small sections of ribbon or rope. This product would be vastly improved if it has straps or velro sewn in."
5,checkers for toddlers,"My toddler has been reading books about checkers, but it isn't safe for him to e around a regular game. I was thrilled to find giant size checkers with a rug for a board. We're having fun (though he still can't grasp the concept of the actual game!)"
5,Review,"It is great for the kitchen table. Also the pieces are nice ,and big. Lastly I would like to say if your looking for something inexpensive and fun to play with, this is the thing to buy."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,Great simple game...Good size. It came quickly and I have enjoyed playing with the set outside as well as inside.
3,"Rug feel cheaply made, bout fun game","This game is huge!!!! Kinda fun play thus. Regardless, The rug is cheaply made because I notice my kid's fingers have black ...look like paint on his finger tips. I wonder it is safe for my child to play. I make my kids to wash hands right after play. I wonder if the rug I receive is defective."
4,Good,A nice product for those that want a checkers board but don't want to get the standard wood board. It looks cool on any table.
5,Fun for the whole family,I purchased this for a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it. I played with one very similiar when I was a kid. It is a fun game that the whole family can enjoy.
5,It's great for the elderly :),"We bought this set for my grandfather who is having trouble seeing in his old age. His favorite game has always been checkers but he couldn't see the smaller board anymore. The size of this set is perfect for him and I recommend it for anyone else with issues seeing :)Very durable pieces too, didn't break when he dropped them or when the dogs got a hold of 'em."
5,Great Version of a Classic Game,This is a great version of a game we all know and love. The pieces are huge and the rug is a novel idea as well. This version of Checkers would be great for visually impaired or other special needs children or just anyone who loves the game and wants a new twist on it.
4,Old-Fashioned Fun on the Living Room Floor,"For some reason, finding a decent quality checkers game board is a little bit of a challenge. However, for a family with children, this one is great.The ""board"" itself is a rug-type material as described on the item's page. It is durable and large. The checker pieces are also good size and seem sturdy.This game is easy to roll up and place out of the way in our living room. It also came with a good, sturdy plastic bag inside which you can store the ""board"" and the pieces of you so choose.When we want to play, we just unroll it (or take it out of the bag) and get started - it's that easy! If you are nostalgic for those days from your childhood where you played games on the floor with your siblings or parents, then this game might bring back some of those memories.It is attractive, well-made and easy to store. Checkers itself is somewhat of a simple game, but great fun for kids or kids-at-heart!"
4,Great none electronic game for the family,My son who just turned 5 loves playing with this jumbo checker set and it is helps with his younger siblings not being able to swallow the pieces. I would recommend this product very pleased with purchase.
1,Not what I needed,I bought this product as a substitute for panoxyl. It didn't work for me at all. My shoulders were still occasionally breaking out and when I rinsed off in the shower it left a film over my whole body.
3,ehhh...,"Firt time user of a 'sulfur' soap. Was hoping to clear up outbusrt of pimples. Didn't smell 'much' like sulfur, just reminded me of cheap bar soap you can get from any store. Skin DOES look better after use (smaller pores, natural healthy shine), but seems like i could have same result w/ANY bar soap used on face because of the slightly dryng tightening effect. Didn't notice any major improvements in pimples, tho they did improve over time. i purchased along withAztec Secret - Indian Healing Clay, 1 lb clay, which is something else i'm not sure lives up to the hype. i also tried a small amount of this soap on my daughter's small patch of eczema, but not sure it made any kind of improvement. Not sure i will be rebuying, but luckily it will last awhile, maybe time will change my mind... i suppose i am happy i tried it over tryng nothing, & worked better than using nothing, but just not convinced it's all that much better than a normal bar of facial soap, yet."
2,hmmmmm,"I saw this in the theater and thought, aside from the great acting turns by James Coburn and Mick, it was rather poor. The main plot conceit is that poor one-trick novelist Garcia has to turn to being a male escort because he cant sell his latest novel. Meanwhile, the guy keeps an OFFICE in an office building to write... something even most successful writers cant afford to do, and B) they TEACH! It never occurs to this guy to try teaching, when that's what EVERY other writer in the world does to make ends meet. THat it said, it wouldn't be so bad if Garcia, in his typical stylye, didn't once again insist on draining every ounce of frivilous fun from the proceedings, as if his acting would lose its dignity otherwise."
3,I wish one could rate a movie 2.5 stars!,"This movie tries really, really hard to be meaningful and insightful and, at times, it actually gets there. Unfortunately, it never quite pulls its story together and the ending is way simplistic and insulting. Still, Andy Garcia is very sympathetic while the real revelation is Mick Jagger who does an excellent job as the devilish pimp. Angelica Huston is also excellent in a small supporting role for which she barely gets credit (odd for an Oscar winner??!!). Anyway, I can't say I'd tell any friends about this movie or recommend it to anyone personally, but if you happen across it and watch it, you'll find a few things to like and a few to dislike. 2.5 stars."
4,A Big Surprise,"Unfortunately, this film didn't get the run it deserved in the theaters. That said, everyone I know who has seen it has something good to say about it. Considering its subject matter, the film is actually just an old fashioned love story.The leads are all perfectly cast but it is Mick Jagger who is the true revelation in all of this. He gives a ""best supporting actor"" performance.Its too bad the Academy Awards basically ignore smaller films that do not have the financial backing to buy, er, win an Oscar."
4,Jaywalkin',"Nice album with a collection of earlier work of JR Monterose. Despite some minor distortions in the middel part of the CD, great sound quality over all. Charles Mingus, Kenny Clarke, Eddie Costa among others play along."
1,answers for very simple people,Just switch on your computer and play with it for one weekend and use the help files. It will teach you more than this book. Don't waste money on this one.
5,An open and honest comentary on present day world !!,"This is the kind of rhetoric I miss in US magazines and newspapers. I don't even expect to see anything like this on TV. No body comes close. She has a fantastic global perspective. I am amazed that Ms. Roy developed a wonderful philosophy in India where majority folks are just like me ""simple minded and too busy with day to day issues to bother about anything else""."
3,There are *much* better resources,"An uninspired but neatly assembled collection of standard LDS-style pedigree charts, based on Moriarty, Cockayne, Isenburg, Turton, Redlich, Weis, and some unpublished sources. Thoroughly footnoted and reliable within the limitations of its sources, but it needs an index! Also pretty expensive for what you get. (And a companion volume of family group sheets would be nice.)"
2,Go for an earlier album...,I think this album lacks the texture and soul of their earlier recordings. They used to care more about the music and less about the production in the earlier years. I also miss the other vocalist (whatever became of him?) and the poppier drumming. Lovesick Porch all the way.
5,The American Girls Rock,"Just like the bands promotional t-shirts say, ""The American Girls Rock!"" If your looking at this page, you must have heard the American Girls before and probably own, or thought about buying, Like The Movies, Only Slower.Please, the biggest mistake you can make right now is writing off this album because 4 of the songs from Like The Movies appear on this record. This is by far a better album than Like The Movies and I absolutely loved that album. If for anything else, get the album for all of the other songs. The only songs I ever find myself skipping are Elizabeth and We're in Love. All of the others are some of the greatest works that this band has produced. Personaly, even the 4 songs that appear on Like The Movies sound much better here.If you like the American Girls or good music in general, this is the album for you. I can speak highly enough."
3,Summer Fun,"We bought this slide for our kids at Fred Meyer for about $400. Our kids loved it, as did all the kids in the neighborhood. The slide seemed very durable, as one of the dads went on it a few times. Unfortunately it only lasted one summer. The fabric got a lot of little holes in it which my husband was able to patch, but the seams started to pull apart. He tried gluing the seams back together, but it just didn't work. The slide would inflate, but as soon as anyone tried to climb up it, it would collapse. My kids were very disappointed because they had so much fun on the slide. My husband and I were disappointed because it was expensive and only lasted one year. We are thinking about replacing it this summer, but with a different brand."
3,"Fun, but fell apart","We purchased this product last year and the kids had a ball using it. Unfortunately, it was not usable this summer because it had so many holes it was not repairable and we could not keep it inflated. It is also very heavy, and hard to roll up and store. I hesitate to buy another one because I don't think it was made very well, even though the kids had a blast on it."
4,songs of inspiration,"This album is a collection of religious and inspirational songs. Many, such as Amazing Grace and Morning Has Broken, are contained in other albums of hers. Judy Collins' voice is gorgeous-the album is worth buying just for her beautiful rendition of Abide With Me-, but there seems to be a sameness to the songs. Individually, the tracks on this CD represent some of her very best work."
5,TOP line UN-Mainstream fun. Take in all the passion and play,"Over The Rhine really outdid themselves here. The way I see it they figured this album was a mix between a musical ""real - world"" (recorded at home with all the fun and inevitabilities of being in living color) and a masterpiece. Not since U2's Joshua Tree has a band put out such a good all around album. The real thing happening here is originality and variety. From Lynford rapping his way through a deep love song to Karen SOOTHING OUT ALL life's wrinkles in Latter Days and Go Down easy. (These previously mentioned 2 songs leave a lasting impression on any first-timer to OTR! Try it out and you'll need another dose!)All of the lyrics intrigue you, the songs take you in and somehow make life's meaning a bit more clear. RIC shows off his Phil Keaggy-esque skill on track 10, the guitar solo. Try Go Down Easy to soothe any crisis late at night with the windows open and the lights off; and Pougkeepsie to renew salvation in your own daily life."
5,Breath taking imagry makes this cd an all time favorite.,"My first exposure to OTR was seeing them open for Cowboy Junkies in Cincinnati. I bought Good Dog, Bad Dog that night and it quickly became one of my favorites. Nearly a year later, I can still listen to this disk and get a variety of different meanings from many of its songs. Karen's voice is phenomenal, and each song is a work of art. This music can be calming, sad, inspiring, and joyous. It WILL speak to you in many different ways!"
5,One of the best albums of the decade,"This album blew me away upon my first listen and continues to give me goosebumps. ""Latter Days"" is simply one of the greatest songs ever recorded. ""Go Down Easy,"" ""Etcetera,Whatever,"" and ""Poughkeepsie"" are all classic songs as well. Karen Bergquist makes full use of her voice, a voice that is touched by God. The arrangments are simple and beautiful and every song has a unique feel. This band is amazing. I rank this up there with The Innocence Mission's ""Glow"" and U2's ""Achtung Baby"" as one my favorite albums. If you are reading this and have not heard this band, GET THIS ALBUM!"
5,album to live by,"deep : spiritual : lush : fun : intelligentthis album is the soundtrack to my life and to many of my closest friends. everyone i have recommended it to has fallen in love with it.there are only a few perfect albums i have ever heard, and besides emmylou harris's Wrecking Ball, this is the best ever.just buy it- buy it for your friends, buy it for your loved ones. buy a bottle of red and some cheese, and a box of tissues."
4,New and revised,"Martha and Keith McCallum have completely revised Martha's book God's Incredible Plan and given it a new title - The Scarlet Thread. The new edition is for sale on Amazon.com, or visit book's Web site at http://ScarletThread.editme.com."
3,Loyal J's Fan Steps on the soapbox,"I've been listening to the J's for a few years now and my rating of 3 stars for this album is relative to their other albums. Since the SuperMercado days we've been seeing a steady decline in the wit content in their albums, as well as a marked increase in their attemps to market their songs to a more brain-dead Top 40 audience. Amidst rumours of the band breaking up this summer this album seems like a last ditch effort to make their sound more appealing to the masses -- at the cost of the wit and sound that I think makes them (or made them) so unique. Don't get me wrong, in contrast to a lot of the other radio fodder out there this album is worth listening to. For any potential new J's fans I would advise getting SuperMercado before delving into some of their later works. J's still kick it as a whole!!"
4,A cute way to learn various facts and info...,"My kids find the Fandex format easy to use, and the information on them accessible. We have several, and with the elections going on this past year they used this one the most.I like the fact that each president has a photo, as well as pertinent info: Date of birth and death, Number; Party represented; Vice President; First Lady's name. As well, there is a bio and some history for each one, including events leading up to and what happened while he was in office.The only quibble I have about these decks is that sometimes when they're completely fanned out, the edges of the illustrations get caught up in each other, making it hard to close them properly. But other than that, they're cute, informative, and a nice format for kids."
5,Great! The whole family loved it--we'll buy another Fandex,"Good information on all levels. Bought it for my kids, but we haved all enjoyed learning about the presidents in this type of format. We will definately be buying more in the future."
1,The One I Bought Fell Apart,"Not much information in this non-book (actually a bunch of flash cards). I thought maybe my kid would like it, but couldn't get him to look at it more than twice. Then the next thing I knew, the whole ""binding"" had broken apart, and we had ""President""cards all over the place. What a mess!"
3,missing # 18,my daughter got this set for Christmas and last night we discovered that Ulysses S. Grant was missing from our Fandex.... anyone else also missing # 18?otherwise it is awesome! she is nine and loves it
4,Favored by RR wives as a favor.,"I used these favors as part of a packet of patriotic theme items when the Railroad wives I was entertaining visited the Washington DC monuments and memorials as my guests. Of all the items in the ""goodie bag"" it got the most attention. Most said it had a nostalgic feel and also was helpful to them to have this information in such an attractive form. Some said they would share it with their children for their education; but most valued it for their own use. This type of publication has a specific use and is not complete in its information content; but is seems to be factual and not at all controversial or political. I recommend it highly."
4,elliot smith = pop genius,"hey if you like elliot smith but hankered for something a little more rockin', this is the CD for you. Great rhythyms, great lyrics, and good energy. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because the record lacks the searing originality of his solo work. But definetely worth getting."
4,Sims,"The game is fun, additional game extensions would make it more fun, such as purchasing the Sims Dating or any other one, which I am planning to do."
4,Enjoyable game,I have always been a fan of The Sims games. I have been looking frantically for one that is compatible with my macbook. The game now has better graphic and new interplay making it even more addicting than the original! If you like to control your own world it is the perfect game!
4,The Highly-Anticipated Facelift to the Bestselling Game of All Time,"After waiting nearly a year for the version to release for the Mac OS, I got giddy opening the box. The wait, over. Totally worth every second.However, as many reviewers quickly discovered, the game runs dissapointingly on the minimum system requirements. This means paddle hands, a poorly rendered wardrobe, fuzzy thought bubbles, and slow, choppy birth (among other) ""sequences"" for the Sim world. Bottom line--either upgrade your system if possible, or lower your performance and graphics standards and hope for the best.The new innovative gameplay stretches new boundaries The Sims Une couldn't even dream of--the aging process, new design elements, expanded architectural boundaries, not to mention the new graphics engine (if your system can tank the arduous workload).What else can be said about the perfect sequel to a classic concept? If you were a sucker for all of the old Sims expansion packs, The Sims 2 will set your heart on fire."
1,I am also angry about the requirements,"My system is only about 2 years old, a 17"" ibook running Tiger. I've been eagerly awaiting this game for months, come to find out my computer was purchased literally a few MONTHS too early and now is ""obsolete"" for the system requirements of this game. GRRR! The problem is that the true SIMs fans out there are probably the ones playing the earlier versions on their earlier Macs. The customer base for this one is likely newer SIMS players. Aspyr, you are going to have a LOT of angry customers here, is there anything you can do to fix this?"
1,Disappointed!,"I pre-ordered this game back in March and had been wildly anticipating its arrival ever since. I cannot believe once I receive it three months later that I am not able to play the game on my G4! I haven't even opened the box, it is being returned immediately! The system requirements are just too high!"
3,Fun if you like running a family,"This game is great fun if you enjoy running people's lives! Unfortunately, I found that I am better at running a civilization than running a family, and so I gave up on it and turned to my Civilization IV game. For me, it just took too much time telling SIMS characters when to eat, sleep, and go to the bathroom. Yes, many of those things can be done automatically, but overall the game just progressed too slowly for me. It was just too tedious."
3,Need fixes for the Mac version,"The first issue - there were several updates or ""fixes"" we had to find and multiple install/uninstall/re-install cycles before the game would work correctly.The second issue - there are more ""outfits"" for Sims to wear but you can't design your own clothes.The graphics are greatly improved and is easier to play than the previous version. More active game time than other Sims games we have played."
4,love it,"I've been playing this game since Sims 1 without any of the expansion packs. I spent my saved up birthday money on Sims 2 once it came out and have gotten a new copy every time I've gotten a new computer (3 since Sims 2.)With an up to date computer this game is fun and addictive, if your computer has poor graphic quality or what not.... it's gonna be a little slow. I played on my family computer for some time and I actually went and got a book to read while it was loading between families and neighborhoods.But with my newest computer the game is pretty fast. I play with Seasons and Nightlife and I can and have played it for hours.Ha, it's like Barbies for older kids."
2,Frustratingly Slow!!!,"Grr...I have a Mac Mini. 512 ram, and 60 GB hard drive space. Sims 2 ran sooooo slow..and my computer often froze during the game.The game itself has great potential and can be quite entertaining if you like detailed architecture and like interior design. However, the Mac Mini just doesn't have the speed to support the game to it's full potential.I would recommend getting the game for a PS2 or an Imac G5.I spent 50 dollars on this game, and it's pretty much useless, unless I buy a faster Mac."
3,The Sims,"Games good, very addicting kind of like pringles chips, once to pop you just cant stop.For it to be really fun you kind of need the expansion packs."
3,I liked Sim City better.,"This game is hard to start up on my Mac Pro and won't even run on my Intel Mac mini. Getting it to run on the Mac Pro usually requires a reboot. I liked the game at first but lost interest after a short while. Sim City on the other hand, kept my interest for months."
3,Sims 2 for Mac,"Well, it still didn't work well with the mac. I've removed it from the computer. It would freeze and some characters, after a while, I'd lose the ability to move them no matter what I'd do."
4,"No review given, as game was returned to manufacturer.","I had to return this game to J&R; due to the fact it came on a DVD and I don't currently own a DVD Drive on my mac computers.BTW, you ought to allow for NA responses in your ratings questions as for how fun, and how I would rate the item. I wasn't able to use the item, as I had to return it. My ratings are nonsense and don't mean a thing.Thank you."
5,finally...,"Well I'm really excited that they're coming out with sims 2, but does it have to be in may? the 30th? But luckily I'm getting a new computer, so I really don't have to wait. But its a really good game, and you guys should enjoy it."
4,.,Does anybody with a powerbook own this game? Because I have a powerbook and I want to see if this game works on it before I buy it because I do NOT want to waste 50 dollars on the Sims 2 and find out that this game I've been wanting doesn't work! =P
1,so upset ):,I RECEIVED A PC VERSION NOT THE MAC! SO UPSET. I WANTED TO PLAY AND NOW I HAVE TO RETURN IT UGH ):
4,Fun,"It is fun game to play if you have the right machine. I'm currently using a G5 dual processor with 1/2Ghz chips under Mac OS Tiger. The only issue i have is loading the game to start.Sims 2 uses an odd copy protect system that makes you think the DVD is unreadable. i've had to double check the DVD to make sure it works and delete the preference file twice. The copy protect makes it impossible to make a backup Dvd for me to use and keep the original safe from damage.Other than that, the game works and is fun to play. I would rate it higher but the copy protect system is why i can't give it a five."
4,Pretty Cool,"Overall, I'm enjoying this game. Some reviewers have complained of sluggish performance, and I can attest that -- this game is a hardware hog. I'm running a 20"" iMac G5 with 2GB of RAM and 64MB Video -- performance is okay with the lower-texture/less lighting settings. My husband is running Sims 2 for PC on his fancy new Dual Core Dell with 2GB RAM/256MB Video -- the game is like butter with all the textures and effects set to high.On the game-play side, the new interactions are neat, but if you had a lot of the expansion packs installed on Sims 1, you'll find yourself soon wanting to purchase all the expansions for Sims 2 to cure the boredom of these provincial little neighborhoods.I have found myself longing for some of the simplicity (no pun intended) of the earlier game, and I think some of the more humorous aspects of Sims 1 were lost on this version. But that aside, this is a vastly expanded game, and well worth shelling out some cash for."
5,BEST SIMS GAME EVER,"I always been a fan of The Sims games. When I got my new MacBook Pro I wasn't sure if The Sims would work on it or not. Well I got The Sims 3 which worked, but every time I would save it and go and play it the next day, my saved game had disappeared and was always telling me to start a new game, which was annoying and made me mad to keep restarting a game.When I saw The Sims 2 for Mac, I brought it because I used to play it on my old computer and really liked it because it had the three neighborhoods and lots of houses, so that you could put lots of families on it. When I brought The Sims 2 I kept saying to myself please work on my laptop. Sims 2 works like a charm on my MacBook Pro and moves really fast. I absouelty love this game and recommend people to buy it.Just a FYI, if an EA Games folder shows up in your documents DON'T DELETE IT, because if you do all of your saved stuff will be gone, cause that it what happened to me a couple days ago.Have fun playing The Sims"
5,So fun,"The game is great. While it does take a decent system to run well, it is well worth owning if your computer is more up to date.Because, to be honest, after a hard day at work or a miserable day at school, there's nothing better than to go home and torture digital people. Because setting an entire family on fire and watching then run around and scream in panic and terror is a great stress relief, and daves a person from having to replace broken items around their original house. :lol:"
4,good game,"this game works well on my mac mini 1.66ghz intel core duo. when i installed the game i only had 512mb ram, since then i have upgraded to 2gig. it ran ok on 512mb but better on 2gig. Shipping was fast. It arrived alot sooner than i expected. I love you Amazon!"
3,SIMS 2 IS GOOD.,It is a great game. The graphics are awesome on the mac. Downfall is that there aren't that many options on things to buy. Some of the great stuff you could buy on Sims and the expansion pacs you simply can't have here. There aren't any great places to visit either. That could be better.
1,Doesn't Run Well on iMac,"Video is choppy and floating control frequently disappears, not playable on anything but the latest hardware.Aspyr Tech support doesn't respond to e-mails.... I can't recommend this game."
3,Sims 2 for the Older Mac,"I have an older iBook G4, a great video editing computer but definitely not meant for gaming. It has an 800MHz processor and god only knows what the video card is, so naturally I assumed it wouldn't run Sims 2. The game neatly adjusts to the computer, so the flaws I'm seeing are dropped frames, increased loading time, and a general tune down of graphic effects. If you enjoy sims games and don't mind dropped frames, ignore the system requirements and play. Sims 2 is a fantastic game."
4,Good as it should be,I owned the pc version and upon switching to a mac realized I just had to have it again. I love this game.
1,Mac System Requirement Issues,"It's just not playable despite the system requirements listed from Aspyr, Apple, or Amazon. Play is choppy. Unless you just purchased a brand new Mac with all the bells and whistles -- wait (even more). Major disappointment."
1,Bugfest!,"This is a great game & I have really enjoyed playing it for the last couple of weeks. Unfortunately it is buggy as hell, to the point of corrupting files so that some families won't even load anymore (especially, of course, the ones you have worked on the hardest). I am running the game on an iMac G5 with 768 MB of RAM, so it definitely meets the requirements.When you start seeing characters with hair or parts of their bodies missing, watch out -- your are headed for crashes and/or corrupt files. I was never able to correctly create a Sim from scratch either -- parts always turned up ""missing"" in the character photo and it is a bit disconcerting to see, for example, a hairdo walking around all by itself.This game is in dire need of a patch, but so far none is available."
1,Aspyr Sucks!,"Ok, well, I wanted to order The Sims 2 for my iMac, but no...I found out it won't even work! Is this some kind of scam, do they have some evil pact with Macintosh to make this game so overhyped that everyone wants it more than anything just to find out even on newer Macs it will not work so you're forced to buy a brand new computer? I think so. Anyway, I really hope they will do something to fix this. A new version or some patches, something! I have been waiting impatiently since I first found out about The Sims 2 to have it and spend countless hours playing, just to find out my less than 2 year old Mac is not good enough for it! Grrrr...."
2,"Not ""All You Need To Know""","I was hoping to be able to set up the LCC with this book, but apparently I needed to get the ""How to Form an LLC"" book (which I'm NOT going to do).I've read the Nolo California Corporations book and it already covered much of the info here. What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm. A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person. Also, the book does not cover the fact that in CA you can specify additional info in the Articles, such as rules for admitting new members.Awfully light for ""All you need to know""."
2,Beware! Does not deliver what it promises- unless you pay more!!!,"The information in this book seems correct as far as it goes. But the book's subtitle says ""All you need to know about limited liability companies."" Turns out, though, that to get ""all you need to know"" you have to buy one or several of their other books, depending on how much of ""all"" you expected to get! For instance, on page 6/18 (3rd edition) the book directs you to purchase one of their other publications to get information on how to operate your LLC. I could accept this if the cover of the book said ""volume 1"" or ""companion volume to..."" but it says ""All you need..."" For a fairly scant $30 paperback to promise all, then direct me to buy another $30 paperback, is IMHO, a broken promise and a lie."
4,Good general overview,"If you are unfamiliar with LLC's this book will be helpful. It provides a thorough overview of the basic information. When I read the book, it spawned a number of ideas and questions about operations, specific provisions to certain agreements, etc. Unfortunately, it does not answer any of these advanced questions."
3,Nolo's Quick LLC,"Left a lot of questions unanswered. Gave reference to find more detail answers to questions about LLCs. Was hoping book would be an answer to all you ever wanted to know about LLC, but it wasn't. While it was helpful, I still had to get answers to some critical questions. I finally hired a lawyer that speciallizes in LLCs, Corporation, and Real Estate."
4,A good overview of LLCs with pointers to more,"I found this book to be very useful for providing me with an overview on LLCs and understanding the breadth of the subject. This is actually very, very useful. All too often, I find that when I try to learn about something I can quickly go down a rathole of depth before I really understand the breadth of options. I felt like this book provided me with the breadth to help me to pinpoint where I should dig in deeper.In my opinion, this book provides the starting point for going down this path and also provides a worth quick reference manual for future use."
4,This book did what it set out to do,"This got us started on the road to our new biz, but what it lacked was real help filling out the State forms. Nolo has another book that does just that (and I recommend it if you are really looking for help with forms). If you are still in the decision making process as to which type of business you want to have (e.g. partnership, LLC, corporation types) and what it takes to run an LLC, this is one to keep on your shelf. My favorite part of this book, Nolo's Quick LLC, is a great chart delineating the differences between different types of businesses."
4,"Very Helpful Book, Helped Me Decide That An LLC Is Right For ME!","This book was not a disappointment by any means. I wanted to learn if forming an LLC was right for me and by the end of reading the book, I knew it was. Nolo's book was surprisingly easy to read and understand. Although the writer is a lawyer, he writes in every day speak and makes the concepts as easy to understand as possible. The book is also more entertaining then one might think. The only thing I would have liked to see as part of this book is a step by step list of who to contact to form the LLC including any forms or at least a link to forms you would need to complete the task. Overall, if you want to learn about LLC's and decide if the business form is right for you, then this is the right book to choose."
5,"Quick easy read, Great Information!","I read this whole book on a flight from Miami to Seattle. I had just started an LLC through a Lawyer and wanted to get an idea of how to put together the Operating Agreement. This book had a great Operating Agreement example in the back. It also had simple examples for each scenario that helped me understand the best type of LLC set-up for my business. Nolo's Quick LLC covered everything I needed to know in an easy format to read and reference. After reading, I felt I was able to discuss my ideas intelligently with my lawyer and ask him questions I would have never thought of before."
5,Great LLC Premer,"This book and the accompaning book entitled ""Form your LLC"" are the best books that I have read on the subject. I was able to put an LLC together, run it by my attorney, and using the info for filing, set up my own LLC. Especially good are the suggestions for finding an attorney and tax man that will help you stay out of trouble. I recommend these books to anyone looking to set up an LLC. The publisher, NOLO PRESS, does a good job on all sorts of legal self help books."
3,State Specific,"If you look at the thickness of this book you would think that it contains alot of details about forming a LLC. However, about 1/3 of the book gives information on forming a LLC for each of the 50 states. This book would be better if it would give specific information for a particular state such as Nolo's Quick LLC for the State of Texas. On the brighter side, this book gives a wealth of knowledge and good examples on forming a LLC. If you are looking for an overview of forming and LLC this book would suffice. However, if you are looking for in depth knowledge, this book is not the one that I would recommend."
4,Very good read,This book is very informative and easy to read and comprehend for anyone interested in starting an LLC or to see if an LLC is for them.
3,not very shiny,"when light hits it, it is a little shiny, but when you take a closer look the tape is dull and wavy. Not very smooth at all, was hoping for a mirror like finish."
3,Sort of Bob Welch meets Cheap Trick meets Huey Lewis sound; Ode to Marsha Davis...,"[Three-and-a-half stars out of Five]This couldALMOST pass for the overrated Motels greatesthits, since their other LPs after Marsha'sthroat cancer scare weren't much. But Motels'great song 'Only the Lonely' is worth thisoverprised LPs bill! Good tunes here andthere but still an overrated group. Tapethis one on same cassette as Cheap Trick'sOne On One and Huey Lewis & News Sports(or on CD)..."
3,Satanic dictionary,"Well what can I say about this book....well for one it has a poor title for what this book is real about.If you are looking for a book on satanic philosify and rituals,then don't buy this book.What this book actually is,a: A to Z book of satanism.You could call it a satanic dictionary.It's a great reference book,but for the price it's not worth it."
3,A good book for the outsiders.,"well,as i saw the title i had the passion to read it.i found it in a friends house,and i finished the book in 3 days. not a worthy book for me,but a good start for an outsider,it gives you somehow the feel of the satanism.and beside nice paintings.over all something intresting to read,but not as a source or a ceriouse guide.if you're looking for a guide to give you the feel of the satanists,start with the most famouse one: The satanic bible."
3,A take you back into yesteryear film with all the forgotten,A movie that takes you back and reminds us of all our favourite stars all those years ago.
3,entertaining,"Michael J. Fox has always made light entertaining movies, although this is not one of his best. Seeing a young Anthony Edwards was a plus.I enjoyed it."
3,Bring the girl,"I remember when HIGH SCHOOL U.S.A. first aired back in 1983. It was a big deal at the time to have a made for TV family movie (do they even do that kind of thing anymore?) that featured the young actors of that period starring alongside the young actors of yesteryear (or now, the year before yesteryear). Jo, Kimberly Drummond, Willis Jackson, and Alex P. Keaton were the students and Gilligan, Dobie Gillis, Eddie Haskell, and Wally Cleaver were among the teachers/faculty/parents. It was creatively written, though many of the gags were lame and corny even for back then.I won't say it's not corny. I won't say it's not embarrassingly lame in some parts. I won't say it's not too silly for it's own good. But I also won't say it's not fun. Indeed, for all it's lameness and corniness, this is still a fun movie to watch."
5,Wacky irrelevant casing,I was just confused by the DVD package that didn't at all relate to the actual movie. Everything else was great though!
5,Once of the best teen tv-movies of the 80s,"Back in the 1980s, NBC had the midas touch when it came to making TV movies with the top teen stars of the period. This was the first of many: High School USA. It's also amazing because at the time, the teens of the cast were top stars:Michael J. Fox (Family Ties) Nancy McKeon (The Facts of Life) Todd Bridges (Diff'rent Strokes) Dana Plato (Diff'rent Strokes) Crystal Bernard (Happy Days) Lauri Hendler (Gimme a Break) Cathy Silvers (Happy Days)Even some up and comers like Crispin Glover and Anthony Edwards have notable roles. This wasn't only an 80s teenfest. It features some of the teen actors of the 50s and 60s, all who made welcomed returns to acting through this film. It has a funny plot and entangles many subplots. If you are a fan of 80s teen flicks, then get this one. It's fun to watch."
2,HIGH SCHOOL USA: Questionable on disc or tape,"It's very disappointing that the only home versions of the made-for-TVer HIGH SCHOOL USA (1983) are questionable ones. The VHS manufacturer,UNITED AMERICAN VIDEO, dubbed their product at SLP speed, the very slowest, and without HiFi audio. The few tapes I own from them have a crap picture, a bad hiss in the sound and major tracking problems.As for the DVD outfitTRINITY HOME ENTERTAINMENT, their extensive catalog of skin flicks and slasher trash doesn't inspire me. After searching out reviews of their discs, I couldn't find anything specific to transfer quality, no raves or rants, yet I'm not prepared to plunge the necessary scratch to risk finding out if they are of better quality than UAE or not.Is it fair to judge a home video outfit by their catalog? That's an individual choice. I gave this one a pass, for what it's worth."
3,Interesting.,"Vashti's Gypsy Passion was not entirely what I was looking for, but it had good points. The women in the DVD came in all shapes and sizes, like real women do. Some of the moves were beautiful and elegant. Some moves had a lot of footwork to learn, but went unseen with the long skirt.The techniques centered around the skirt, and did not show any moves with the torso. I would not call this so much as a belly dance tehnique, as much as an interesting skirt dance."
4,easy to follow,"This dvd was a very easy to follow choreography, i did enjoy and appreciate the front and back instructions it made it so much easier to do. Love this dvd, although it doe's help if you have done flamenco."
1,I havent receive this item,"I am still waiting for this item, I havent receive it, please give me information about this shipment.. i am waiting"
4,Tight Song,"Ever since this song came out in 1997, I have liked it. K.P. and Envyi both can blow. Envyi sings real well~think of a more soprano PINK and Envyi can rap~think Eve. The remixes and extra tracks are definitely hot. THis is a CD that can certainly still get a party started so check it out."
2,2 stars for the 2 versions.,"The 2 diferent versions (remix with rap and, lp version) are the only things salvageable off an other wise waste of $13. Swing My Way is an OK song but spend your money on another full lp."
5,Great indoor fun!,"No matter your age (though probably 10+), this game is great fun!! We've entertained nephews and neighbors for hours on end with this game, and the rules and strategy make for more than just entertainment. Each person has their own domino line, a ""train,"" that's protected on which they can build at any time. There's a free line of dominoes you can also build on -- the so-called ""Mexican Train."" But other players can really cause havoc with open doubles or blocking your move, and it may cause you to lose control of your train! :-) Good fun for all ages, but careful, time flies when you're having fun!"
4,numbered domino set with Mexican train hub,No problems. Shipment arrived promptly. Purchased as a gift so I didn't open the package but I have a set of these dominoes myself and have enjoyed them very much
4,This game set works,This super train set works well but would be better if the number 6 and 9 weren't so similar in color. The case is a bit difficult to snap shut when filled with the dominoes.
3,Haven't read the book yet! How am I supposed to know!?,"Amazon keeps bugging me about this review. I bought 3 books at once, do u think I'm a speed reeder. If u don't give me time to read them how am I supposed to know if they r any good?"
5,The best fighter-pilot's book I ever read,"The one characteristic that makes this book stand out above all others is its honesty. This is not a ""gung ho"" story that makes light of the awfulness of war.Clostermann made no secret of his fear, or the toll the experience took on his nerves, but he persevered. This bravery must have been evident to others, as evidenced by his rank at the war's end.This book belongs in the collection of anyone with an interest in flying or aerial warfare.It deserves a reprint."
4,A superior account of WWII aviation experience,"I first read Clostermann's account of his experiences about thirty years ago as a teenager. His account of his experiences was lucid and compelling. Of particular interest is that he flew the Hawker Tempest in action. This brute of an aircraft had a 24 cylinder Napier Sabre sleeve valve 'H' engine and was a slim winged successor to the Hawker Typhoon.You will go a long way to find a similar quality book. The only one that comes to mind is the German equivalent ""I Flew for the Fuhrer"", which I also read as a child and note is in print again and on sale at Amazon."
2,"GREAT HISTORY, BUT THERE IS ONE PROBLEM...","This marvellous job, written by the author based on his own diary, was made soon after WW II, and it is a great piece of literature, with emotions, showing the difficulties of the missions flown, the fear of flak, the capability of the enemie pilots. But there is one big, very big trouble: the alleged 33 aerial victories of the author are not recognized by RAF historians, who put the figure in between 11 and 16 air victories. This explains why Clostermann is almost never mentioned in books about RAF aces. Some sources even say that he made claims for victories when he never shot his weapons!! (See ""Oxprey Aircraft of the Aces - LAte MArque Spitfire Aces)"
1,Biased in favor of affirmative action,"Inadequate fact and value analysis of the interests at stake. Author wants to substitute class quotas in place of racial quotas. Results would be the same: unfair, divisive, unworkable. An example of Justice Holmes' statement that, ""It is one thing to think from a protected cloister; it is another to think for action upon which great interests depend"". Author should climb down from his ivory tower and get a real job."
1,Too Bad,This book is written with all the finesse of a 6th grader's essay on `Why I like being Irish'. It was also apparently edited by a 5th grader. Getting through the stilted dialogue is like hiking through mud. There is no depth of story; it's like a digest of itself. I kept reading hoping it would get better. Don't make the same mistake.
3,It does the job...,"Nothing remarkable to report...it's got nice b/w pics, the calligraphy is decent and the english words are clearly printed. To sum it up...boooring, but hey, it gets the job done."
4,Cute book,"Just know that the sticky tongue will be torn off within an hour of opening. I thought this book would be much larger. If I had known how small it would be, I would have gotten the $10 one."
3,"cute story, poor quality","this is a cute story, however this is about the cheapest, poorest quality of a board book i have ever seen."
4,Delightful Kids Book,My son and I loaned this book from the library;liked it so much we had to buy it!!!
3,"Not what I expected, but still enjoyable","I am a children's librarian in training, so I am always on the lookout for good books to read aloud. I was expecting a larger pop-up book to use for story-times at the library. Unfortunately, this book is too small (5""x5"")to use for story-time purposes. However, my own kids love the book! The illustrations are vibrant and charming, and the kids love pulling the stretchy tongue on the cover and watching it snap the fly back to the frog's mouth. Best for younger children, ages 3-5."
4,"My daughter loves it, but.....","My husband and I hate this book (maybe just because we're tired of it) but my 2 year old loves it, which is all that matters! Everytime we read the part where the frog's tounge comes out....wooop!....she laughes and giggles and wants more, more, more!!! By far better by the same author is ""The Icky Sticky Anteater."" It actually has a moral to the story and the illus. are wonderful!!!"
5,The Icky Sticky Frog,"Love, love, L-O-V-E IT! Kids love this type book and the tongue gives an opportunity to not only see but feel the icky sticky tongue! As a teacher, my students really enjoyed it. A good way to introduce the food change....frog enjoys his lunch and then is eaten....surprise ending."
2,book size too small,"This is a cute book but it is too small to read to more than one child at a time, just 5 inches high and 5 inches wide. I read to a small Kindergarten class and have to hold the book up so they can see the pictures after I've read each page and unless the child is actually standing in front of me it can't be seen. The story is suitable for a young child but the words are too difficult for a young child to read so they must be read to. Also, the fly that sticks to the tongue on the cover keeps dropping off."
2,Good book but very small size and overpriced on Amazon,"The book itself is very good, but I was shocked to find out it is only about 5 inches square. At $12 on Amazon.com, it's overpriced by about $7. The list price is actually $4.95 and you can find it at Barnes and Noble for that price. DON'T PAY $12 + S/H FOR THIS BOOK!"
3,Was hoping for more interaction...,"Maybe I did not investigate enough prior to purchase, but I was hoping that the book would guide you to more of an interaction using the tongue to catch critters. Instead, the tongue is only available on the front of the book. Mine is already losing it's stickiness and stretching out with limited use."
1,Not for Sensitive or Young Children,"I bought The Icky Sticky Frog for my 3 year old grand-daughter, but after receiving it, I'll donate it to Goodwill. The problem is that the insects the frog eats, are drawn beautifully and engagingly, and it is just horrible and awful to watch these compelling creatures being murdered one by one. The fact that the frog gets murdered at the end just teaches a kind of evil vengeance that is hardly a lesson a young child needs. This is NOT a young child's book."
2,"Cute, but tongue fell off first day","""Santa"" gave this to my 3-year-old boy for Christmas. That same day, I was picking up toys before bedtime, and found this strange red rubbery thing on the floor. Oops, the tongue had already come off the book. Cute story, but not durable enough!"
5,Excellent food chain book,"I pre-read this book and thought my 3 and 1.5 year old would not like the ending...instead they delight at the change of fortune, not because their evil but they realize that every thing needs to eat something to live. Have your kids asked about chicken nuggets yet? This book is one of the few that talk about the food chain and how a cute insect is gobbled and then another and another to establish a pattern then the frog is dinner himself. I embelish the sound effects and it's treated light heartedly which seems appropriate for introducing such a ""scary"" concept to this age group. Great for ""short"" bedtime routines too."
5,"Icky, Sticky Frog","This book is actually a lot of fun to read. The pictures are bright & beautiful. The icky, sticky tongue on the cover is fun to play with as well. Just a fun book to read!"
5,Johnny Mathis Live in Las Vegas,"The song ""And Her Mother Came Too"" is on this album. I've has it for years on cassette and wish I could find it on CD. it's a great album!"
5,The System in Which I Am Well Pleased,"My wife and I bought this Panasonic Home Theatre Package August 16, 2004 for my birthday and we are completely content with the purchase.The set up was simple and the surround sound is spectacular; and all of this (and so much more) for a very reasonable price.You can buy with confidence this simple system which allows for a myriad of adjustments and sound combinations that will bring enjoyment to movie night at home."
2,Mixed thoughts,"The sound quality was amazing, eventhough I didn't get crank it up to a good level. DVD player portion broke after 2 days, would only display &quot;wait&quot; as soon as it was turned on and could not do anything except oddly being able to change the equalizer mode. Had to manually pull out trays to get my dvd's back so that I could return the unit. I will give it one more shot because of the namebrand,sound quality and good price."
1,Sorry I cannot give it ZERO stars!,"I purchased this system 1.5 years ago from Walmart. Not a bad price and the sound was ok (while it worked). Some set up issues and arrangement problems due to short cables but all in all OK for the price.However: little did I know that six months later, after not all that much use and sitting in one and only one location, it absolutely refused to put out sound! NO SOUND AT ALL except for the first few seconds playing a CD. That's it! After that, nothing.Six months of use is all I got for my money. Panasonic refused to answer my questions via their website. ARGHHHH!NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE PANASONIC!!"
1,Don't Buy One,I purchased this unit back in 2004 and now only 2 speakers.........the front left and right work. My next unit will definitely not be a Panasonic!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wasted my hard-earned money on this equipment.
5,Swedish Weaving,I have been looking for patterns for Swedish Weaving on Monk's cloth. This book features beautiful patterns with detailed instructions on how to weave their patterns. It starts with beginners patterns and ends with advanced patterns. My 12 year old daughter has never tried this before and was able to follow the pattern instructions given and enjoys this now.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this craft!
2,not what I expected,this is definately not what I thought it was going to be. I was looking for highlights from the regular season and playoffs but this has mostly yapping from fans and talk show hosts with a few highlights thrown in. look for a different dvd if you want mainly highlights.
1,"I agree, Aretha darlin Please don't sing classical!","Here we go again, is a really sweet track.Funky it kinda reminds me of Chain of fools.It's soulful, really gritty (in my opinion the way soul should be) and danceable, not adult contemporary, which is nice to hear from a verteran artist.Beautiful vocal performance.Sure other verterans are doing danceable music,but they have to be computer modified. Many don't have the vocal stamina to sing belters like this one. Now ""Nessun Dorma"" is one of my favorite arias.My sister is an Opera singer. On more than one occassions she sang this song.I aggree with 2 previous reviewers, Aretha is a soul singer and the Best Soul Sister out there.I think she should stick to pop/R&B.She does not have the voice for classical, just like a classical singer does not have the voice for Soul.Technique and style in singing are just as important as learning how to SPELL. ARETHA I love you, and I love your Gospel, R&B, Rock, Jazz and Gospel stuff but steer clear of Classical."
5,Aretha is BACK!!!!!,"Aretha Franklin is back with a bold CD, and its nice to know that soul is here again with a bang. PIMP YOSHI says: Buy this CD"
4,Nessun Dorma defended,"Now, I'm not as big of an Aretha fan as the other reviewers... and I'm not classically trained. But, I love the Aria ""Nessun Dorma."" And, even though she butchers the Italian, Aretha does a GREAT job with this piece.The whole reason she sang the piece in the first place was because Luciano Pavarotti got sick the night of the Grammys. She filled in for him, having never sung the piece before. Knowing that, she did an awesome job.She is the undisputed king of soul. And, it's nice to see someone as good as she is take a risk once in a while."
2,Sister Re` should stick to the pop music genre.,"There is no bigger Aretha fan than I. I have almost all of her albums on vinyl or cd. As a classically trained vocalist myself I feel the the Queen butchered the great ""Nessun Dorma"". She is a pop vocalist, not an opera singer. Nessun Dorma is an amazing Aria but this ""R&B"" interpretation by the Queen of soul is enough to make any classical singer cringe. The first two tracks are good however."
4,"Great comp, original bands","Wonderful cover of Big Black's Bad Houses by Chicago duo-bass Dianogah makes this a keeper. A Minor Forest's Lady (Little River Band tune) is less than graceful, but a novelty piece. Perfect original by Dis- included here. A great intro to the Chicago sound of the 90's."
5,Pleased,"Looking around for this book at the dealership took me having to travel 30 miles to the closest Harley shop, at least 1 hour of my time and still they would need to order it. It would take 2 to 3 weeks for it to come into the shop and would cost approximately $75. On Amazon, I ordered online, didn't leave my house, took 5 minutes to order, the cost including s&H still did not even total 1/2 of what I would have speant through the dealership. Not to mention I received the book mailed directly to my home in 3 days. Go figure??? Talk about Harley jipping people; whoa! Get what you need here, convenient, quick and fast."
4,Used book in great condition; great deal!,"This book is very hard to acquire and it was in fairlynew condition when I received it. Its exterior and physical condtion was like new. If not for a few hi-lighted pages and brief written notes inside, it could be considerewd brand new. I am happy with the book; its condition was vcery good foe a used book and the delivery took only 1 week."
4,Insightfully Helpful,"Such a simple format, use the Dr. Kushner's little profile test and find you ""eating pattern"". Then the doctor explains what each of the patterns means and gives insightful and helpful advice to tweek your eating and exercise personality toward a more healthy lifestyle. And even though I fall into multiple eating patterns, which was comforting to learn is normal, I can easily reference whatever section of the book I need now. This book is the best money I've spent on anything diet related in a very long time."
1,"What ""Night Whispers?""","After Whitney, My Love, Judith McNaught became my favorite author. When I saw that her most recent novel had finally made it to paperback, I grabbed it and ran to buy it. I was practically salivating by the time I sat down and almost reverently open the book to read.Yuck. What happened to the Judith McNaught who created characters and situations that made you cry? The plot had potential. This novel didn't even touch that potential.What ""Night Whispers?"" Did I miss something?Shame on you, Judith. Please don't disappoint your loyal fans again."
2,"Its good, but not realistic at all","I bought this book to read on a plane ride and I must admit that I could not let go of the book. Chapter after chapter I read thinking that it was the best book I had ever read. But then, i noticed there were times when descriptions of uncessesary objects took up pages. Everything was actually very predictable. A meets B. A likes B. B likes A. A hurts B. B hates A. A begs B. B forgives A. Wow. Add to this a boring family history and u have a somewhat boring yet addictive book. The ending made me wonder if I was missing pages. All in all, I read it in one day, so regardless it could not have been too bad. I recomend it to people who stick to books after they buy them, like I had to do"
4,"Different, but still Good","I really enjoyed Night Whispers. It started off a bit slow, but then I got really into it. It is very different from the usual Judith McNaught novels, but I thought it still had the same quality as her others. I am looking forward to the Water's Edge."
2,Several mistakes...,I have just finished this book and found myself left unsatisfied. There were several mistakes where names were different to who was actually having the conversation. For example a conversation with just Noah and Sloan but it said Paul in the next paragraph. This led me to think that the author chopped and changed the story while halfway through. After coming across this sort of mistake a few times I lost interest but perserved to the end. Since beginning the book I felt that the romance between the main chars wasn't really as indepth as other books have been which is why I probably felt unsatisfied because I couldn't get into the story. The sub-plot of Sara and Jess wasn't dealt with by the end either. I agree with the reader who said it wasn't a romance.
1,"Awful, awful, awful",What a waste of time. This book is just terrible. The characters are one-dimensional and totally unbelieveable and unsympathetic. The plot is so ridiculous. I've read McNaught before and wasn't that impressed -- this book confirms that assessment.
3,Esthatic!,"Night Whispers was undoubtly another masterpiece created by mcNaught. Although the first few chapters was quite slow, but the pace was increasingly good when Sloan met Noah. I could even feel the heat and i could not help smiling. McNAught is increasingly good at creating characters."
4,"Never read McNaught before, but enjoyed the book","I've never read Judith McNaught before, I've had this book on my shelf for five years and I finally got around to reading it. I was not disappointed, it was what I expected. I enjoyed the the characters; Sloan who is a no-nonsense cop & her slew of friends. I liked the sexual energy that was between her & her cop friend Jess & then also Jess & Sloan's other friend Sara. I also enjoyed the whole plot of her being estranged from her father & sister and now after 20some years getting a call from her father & one from the FBI. I was also anticipating how it would turn out- was her father really a criminal, would her sister & grandmother open up to her? And was the family friend Noah a criminal as well?It wasn't the best book I've read, but I wasn't disappointed either. It's kind of a cross between a romance & mystery book."
2,Unless you're a diehard J.M. fan...,"If you're not than chose one of her others all of which I have enjoyed. I wouldn't give any of her other books less than 4 1/2. This book however was such a disappointment, particularly for such a best selling author! The only adjective for it is Lukewarm. Though she uses her usual base plot line, the main characters had zero chemistry and the subplot of a potential romance between two other characters peters out about halfway into the book going absolutely nowhere. The book just stops mentioning them and quite frankly I was relieved. Those long pauses between the action were even more boring than the rest of the book. There is also some information given about the suspense that is set up to be important at the time however is never mentioned again... The plot drags, the suspense is sketchy, the passion droops, and the characters lack anything charismatic enough to make them come alive. All in all a poorly woven book."
2,night whispers...,"ok what happened here? this book was impossible to follow, and it was one of the few i just could not finish. i think i stopped a chapter or two after Sloan and her father's reunion. it was just not believable at all. i skimmed thru the last, oh, two-thirds or half of the book, and i just could not find out how, or why, Sloan and Noah got together. there was no chemistry, no romance, no nothing!!! at first i thought she would be paired with Jess, then with Paul, anybody but Noah!!! Even his father would have been better! He was BORING. and what was with all the plots left hanging? mainly the one involving Sara and Jess. i believe the last we hear of them is when she slams the door in his face, then nothing. i have to admit, i think i'd have rather read their story than Sloan's. the only reason i gave this book 2 stars was because of the beginning, before Sloan left to meet her father and sister. that part i honestly enjoyed, but after that, i just could not continue reading."
3,A good read but alas not her best work,"Judith McNaught is an author I always enjoy but I have to agree with so many others who reviewed this book that it was not up to her usual standard. She completed the book without truly letting the reader know what Noah's career involved. The biggest disappointment was to pull us into the relationship between Sara and Jess and then leave it undeveloped. Why............ It was also too difficult to believe that no one would have checked into Sloan's career before she showed up in Palm Springs. In spite of the disappointments, 'Night Whispers' is still worth reading. Judith McNaught at 80% is still far better than many romance writers."
2,A mediocre work from a magnificent author,"I love Judith McNaught and all of her books, so I was very disappointed in this story. She did a good job of developing a suspense thriller but her development of characters and their relationships was weak. I kept waiting for another Matt Farrell and Meredith Bancroft. I felt that there were many loose strings left in this novel, especially many unanswered questions about Noah Maitland. I hope Ms. McNaught takes her time with the next novel and combines a suspenseful story with real character development and intercharacter relationships. I know she can because she is only one of two romance authors that I read and she is superb!"
3,"Judith McNaught, You Could've Done Better!","Like many readers here, I am a dedicated fan of JM. I love all her books, but this one didn't really 'click' with me. The romance in this book was entirely lacking because I could not tell where they fell in love, I knew they were attracted to each other, but lets face the facts, lust is not love. In addition, I didn't really like the character of Noah in the first place because JM doesn't describe him enough to make the readers feel that we know him; thus, I did not sympathize with him at all. If I had not read Perfect and Paradise before I read this book, I would consider Night Whispers to be a great book. Unfortunately, I've read those two books and I know how well Judith McNaught can write and how good her stories could be that I am just not satisfied with this book at all."
2,Surprisingly disappointing...,"After reading this book, i felt that it should have been more of a suspense or action story that was just riddled with elements attraction between the protagonists. i was very disappointed with this because there's not enough romance between Noah and Sloan. i suppose ms. mcnaught thought that venturing a bit into the action/thriller genre could prove just as rewarding as writing exclusively on romance. but personally, i really disliked the outcome of this story. the deep and heart-wrenching emotion that is ms. mcnaught's signature writing is simply lacking here."
3,A fun read,"Great mindless entertainment! I love the mix of romance with a mystery to solve. The characters were interesting too. The old grandmother was a hoot and Courtney was great! But there was something missing between the two main characters. As another reviewer stated, there were lots of relationships that weren't fully developed. It wasn't one of her best works. But it was still a fun read."
3,Just ok,Definitely not Mcnaughts best. The characters were ok but I felt the book was missing something.Would like to see more romance in the present than details from the past.
4,Loved This Book,"Just like with all of McNaught's books, I was riveted by the character development and the small details that make me think about the characters when I'm not reading the book! One of my all time favorite authors and this book did not disappoint me! The ending was cute, and let me completely satisfied!"
2,A huge departure and disappoint compared to her other work.,"Ms McNaught pushed this book through without her usual wonderful character development, attention to unique and stirring vocabulary and without her usual enthralling dialogue. Each of her other books are keepers to be read over and over. This effort is an apparent attempt to enter into a new area of literature, ie, murder/suspense. By page one hundred the reader is still wondering who he/she reading about and waiting to be caught up in the plot."
4,Not McNaught's Best - But It's Still a Great Read,"Judith McNaught is an excellent writer of romantic tales - and it still shows with ""Night Whispers."" Following her previous books, ""Perfect, ""Paradise,"" ""Kingdom of Dreams,"" and ""Whitney, My Love,"" ""Night Whispers"" has a tough act to follow - and it doesn't quite meet my expectations. However, I still had a hard time putting it down and was disappointed to see it end. It has Judith McNaugt's trademark romance, that delights this reader and she is still my favorite romance writer."
3,"Good, but not great","I had this book on reserve at my library months before it was even published. I love Judith McNaught and generally enjoyed her latest contemporary romance. Sloan was a believable and smart heroine and Noah was the typical handsome millionaire. Unfortunately that is about as far as McNaught took his character. He is the stock hero. I was a little disapointed at this underdevelopment of the hero, especially from an author of McNaught's caliber. This general disatisfaction also spilled over to the book as a whole. It just seemed too short, things were sketched in just enough to get me involved, but not enough to satisfy my need for character development and resolution. I'd recommend reading this book, but it is just not worth the hardcover price. Get it from your library or when it comes out in paperback. It's a good read, but McNaught usually leaves me laughing and crying and wanting to start the book all over again. Jordan"
2,Too bad!,I am a big Judith McNaught fan so I was disappointed when I bought and read this book. I really didn't buy the characters' love for each other. When and how did it happen and why?Don't let this discourage you from buying other Judith McNaught books. Some of her other novels are absolutely breathtaking!
1,Avoid this book,"This book was not up to Judith McNaught's typical standards. There was little to no character development, and by the end of the book, you really just didn't care what happened to the people involved. This book would have been ok as a mystery, but as a romance, it fell short. The romance between Sloan and Noah plodded along, and you never really began care whether or not they can overcome the obsticles in their way. In the end I walked away from this book very disappointed. If you haven't read Judith McNaught, don't start with this one, go read Perfect or Until You to see how amazingly Ms. McNaught can write."
1,I'd have chosen NO STARS if that was an option,"I read this book on a friend's recommendation. Normally I wouldn't have finished it, but I kept thinking that I must get through to the end of this book and then all would make sense! This is a story full of holes and uninteresting dialog. I thought I might find something familiar in this book since I used to live in Palm Beach area but there was nothing familiar! I don't think Ms. McNaught has ever been near there!! I'm still puzzling over how these romances developed out of this stupid story. This was THE worst book I have ever read."
1,I would give it a 0 Star.,"Midnight Whispers fails to meet up to the standards of her other books. I was quite disappointed with this novel. The characters were not detailed and developed as well. By the end of the novel, I didn't understand her characters at all or the situations she placed them in. It left an sense of dissatisfaction. It is not a romance nor is it a mystery story. It is an injustice to Paul who deserves better for his unself efforts in Perfect."
1,A Big Flop ! =(,"I was really disappointed with this book. It cost a lot and then I was just frustrated at the end. It doesnt have the same magic and wonderful creativity as the past books of Ms Mc Naught. the likes of Something Wonderful, Whitney my Love, Paradise, Perfect, Almost Heaven are the best but this Night Whispers ? I wont recommend it.... **Sigh**"
1,my GOD!,"i thought i was out of my mind when i have finished THIS book.thi book is totally out of her normal standard.the night whispers n remember whed are terrible .the story does not focus on romance at all.it is totally different from her previous books.whitney,my love n once n always are great.thumbs up for judith!i hope you can improve your story in the near future. thank you n good luck."
3,Wait For The Paperback!,"Judith McNaught is one of my favorite authors. I love her heroes and her heroines, and her plots are always great. Whereas this book is a very good read, it lacks some indefinable magic that McNaught has always been consistent to deliver until now. The plot is good, the characters are good...it just seems as if she's getting tired of trying to tug your heart-strings. Anyway, it's worth the paperback price, but not the hardcover. Whereas I enjoy contemporary romances as much as I do historicals, I must say that I wish she would start turning out more historicals again---I think she always did them best. I would buy her previous historicals in hardcover---in a heartbeat!---but I wish I hadn't bought this one quite so quickly."
4,Stunning Storyteller when Night Whispers Silence!,"Judith Macnaught is a stunning Storyteller especially when the Night Whispers Silence at midnight with its enthralling, masterful plots creating suspense. It has been great reading this book endlessly as it heads like a series of Stunts in the Bond movie Die Another Day. Judith's books are all Romantic filled with suspense leaving readers awed. The mystery shrouds around Sloan Reynolds whose upbringing was away from her family who suddenly invites her and she enters into her father's life when the FBI Agent Paul informs her that her father and his associates are suspected of fraud and murder. She hides her true profession and meets Noah to whom she is attracted and passes through a maze of deceit and passion as the story goes on. Quite capturing book, witty and romantic filled with plots. Night Whispers is jes a Superb Book - a wonderful love story, fast paced and a great page turner, my Pick for sure:-)"
3,Could have been better...,"I'm a big fan of Judith. I love her stories and her male characters. However, this story left me a little disappointed.I enjoyed the plot and was very pleasantly surprised when I realized that good old FBI agent Paul Richardson had a closure after his appearance in ""Perfect"". I just wish the author could've given us a little bit more about his relationship with Paris. The Susan/Jessup relationship was another let down. I was very enthus about them in the beginning and hugely disappointed when nothing else was mentioned about them as a couple. It seems to me that with the exceptioh of Sloan, Noah and Courtney, the rest of the characters were not given a chance to fully develop."
3,"Not Too Good, Not Too Bad...",I must first confess that this is the first book I have ever read by Judith McNaught and I found it to be quite mediocre. There was great sexual tension between Noah and Sloan but other than that there wasn't much left. The death of the great-grandmother was almost too rushed. The book seemed full of detail at first and then the ending seemed to be rushed as well. It was as if the author was running out of paper to write her story on. It was just an average story in my opinion.
2,"Predictable plot, flat characters","I was quite disappointed with McNaught's latest effort. The plot was an attempt at high crime and drama but felt scripted and predictable. The characters were static and stereotyped. And while we all expect happy endings in romance novels, this one was just too much. Everyone got married and lived happily ever after. The sugar-coated resolution of emotional family issues was also difficult to swallow."
1,just like dozens of other mystery romance books,Judith McNaught has written another uninteresting book similar to Remember When. She should go back to her earlier books (that's where her fans came from) and try to remember what made her books special. I have all of her books but I am finally fed up. I will not buy her new book.
4,"Something different, but just as good!","Helllloooo...check the book binding, it says ""Fiction"", not ""Romance"". This was very entertaining and well written. The characters have a lot of substance, and the minor players could each easily have their own stories written. It was not a run-of-the-mill romance, but has mystery and suspense, as well as a poignant romance. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't quite the book ""Paradise"" is, but I liked it more than ""Perfect"" and it certainly had more to chew on than ""Remember When"" (although I think I liked ""Remember When"" more than most readers!). Keep writing Judith, and I'll keep reading!"
3,Not very impressed.,"O.K. I have been reading her books ever since I read the first one, Perfect and I was hooked. I guess I just liked the romance that takes place. Night Whispers in a way, shows Judith's style. Everything is good for a while and then something has to go wrong. As usual, I always feel that she leaves me hanging at the end of the book where we are supposed to assume that everything is perfect. I did not like the way Noah treated Sloan towards the end in Night Whispers though."
2,is this the outline ??? where is the rest of the story,if you really love jm which i do you will still buy this book. but save you money for the paperback
4,"A pretty good book, but there were a few things missing.","I agree with many other people who wrote reviews. I was very disappointed that the relationship between Jess and Sara was not explored at all. She may use them in another book, but I had hoped that Judith McNaught would at least give us some happy ending for them. I also thought that Paul and Paris' relationship was underdeveloped. Too much time was spent on the suspense and not on the romance."
3,Still Love Judith even though not her best book,I remembered Noah Maitland's name from another of her books (I hope) so that was fun. Several times (3) the characters names were mixed up (bad editing guys) so it was confusing for a bit. Always enjoy her books and even bought this one in hardback. Worth the read but not as intense as some of her others. I'll read them all and so should you if you love Judith McNaught. Editors take note of the 3 errors. Ugh.
1,DISSAPOINTING DRUDGERY,"I have read every single Judith Mcnaught book to date and have to say that I am a little dissapointed in her last 2 novels. I miss the love, romance and spirit of her previous novels. I am not sure if this new writing style is a fluke, or if she is attempting to following a Sandra Brown, mystery-action-romance trend. I love her work and presently have found no other romantic writer who can compare to her previous style and class in works such as ""A Kingdom of Dreams"", ""Paradise"" and ""Whitney My Love"". I urge Judith to continue to write these historical romances that readers have proven to love. I hope that she ceases this new trendy style that thus far her faithful readers have proven to dislike."
3,"Good, but not what I expected.","Judith McNaught is one of my favorite authors. I have read almost all of her material and couldn't wait to read this one. However, when I finished with the book I thought, ""Did I miss something here?"". Then I wanted to see what others readers thought and decided to look for the reviews at AmazonBooks. Guess what? Several readers apparently feel the same way did. Happy to read a McNaught, but a little disappointed with the content. I liked the way the character of Sloan was developed and actually thought a relationship was going to develop between her and Jess Jessup for a while. In general, I liked the book; but all of the characters besides Sloan and Paul Richardson seemed somewhat underdeveloped. I'm looking forward to a better development of some of the other characters in future books"
2,"Get it from the Library, don't buy it.","Judith McNaught has written some wonderful books, this is not one of them. Paul, the manipulative FBI agent in Perfect, is back and as obnoxious as ever. It's a pity someone did not shot him in his sit upon. He ended up with Paris, who was too good for him, and he certainly did not do enought to end up with a wonderful girl. I hope to meet Jess & Sara in another book; sorry she didn't see fit to do more with them. Noah Maitland came off with too many shades of unexplained gray and black to end up as the good guy. After leaving Sloan Reynolds in jail, she should have written him off as a lost cause. She loved him enough to forgive him, but he did not love her enough to even listen. This is what she wanted to build a life on? Give women some credit for having brains. His father and sister were more likable. This story line needes alot more work."
3,Not up to Judith's usual par.,"I have read many Judith McNaught novels and always loved her stories because she makes you really know and understand the characters. This book, however, falls far short. I found far too many unanswered questions in this book, and the book's outcome seemed so out of character for the heroine."
1,Why no 0 stars for the choices?,Judith should have just used her time rewriting Miracles instead of this book and the even worse Remember When. What a waste of time.
3,The Audio book was not bad - somewhat entertaining,"I listened to this story today in the car. It was not a bad story, although I would have liked to hear more about Noah and Sloan's romance. I will have to say that I liked this better than Whitney, My Love and Almost Heaven. I am considering reading the book now, to maybe catch some of the things that were taken out for audiobook. I hope I'm not disappointed, like I was with her other two books."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I had a hard time finding the willpower to finish this book. The plot was more centered on police procedure and thrill/mystery elements, which are not what I read Judith McNaught for. She should stick to the well-developed characters and romance which were once her trademark."
3,OK,"It was OK. I do think that this author is defintely stronger in historical books. I think the story was interesting but the characters were just not written that well. They were predictable and I just didn't feel any connection.I like it when the author makes them somewhat real. When they are all perfect and do exactly what you expect them to do, well it's just boring. It was the same with Perfect. The heroines were beautiful,nice, and too good to be true. The heros were former womanizers, handsome and rich. I did finish the book which is why I gave it 3 stars."
4,A Fast Read,"It is the 1st JM book I've read and I enjoyed it. I did feel alittle let down by the ending. I was looking forward to more on Sara and Jessup - and where did the relationship between Douglas and Sloan's Mother come from - who cares?! All in all, I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading another JM book in the future."
3,Least favorite of Judith McNaught's work...,"I have been a Judith McNaught fan for 7 years. I love all of her historical romance and some of her contemperory romance, but this book? I think it belongs more to suspense. I feel that Judith McNaught will fare much better in romance stories than suspense.From the beginnig of this book, there are way too many characters and you will not know who to focus on. The couple in the story do not seem to love each other very much. The sparks that readers usually find in her books are absent from this one.A disappointment... : ("
1,McNaught has just about lost me.,"I do like much of McNaught's older work, and her contemporaries can be very good. But this is so implausible you just can't get past the set-up.Are we actually to believe that her rich father (involved in illegal activity no less) wouldn't have his estranged daughter thoroughly checked out before he invites her to spend time in his home? He wouldn't have any idea that she's a cop? Even after calling her on the job? The story just can't make it past that enormous hiccup.I consider that a kind of laziness. There may be deadlines, but when something makes no sense, a writer must take a hard look at it and figure a way to make it work. I'm certain many of McNaught's loyal readers could have come up with a scenario where a rich, shady character could have his estranged daughter in his home without knowing she's a police officer and have it be sustainable in the storyline."
2,I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS BOOK,"Boy, was I disappointed in this one. I should have waited for the paperback!!!"
3,Murder mystery with romance and family conflicts.,"Not up to the usual high standards of her past books. The characters are much more superficial, and the different relationships in the book are banal and predictable. Wait for the paperback."
3,Explanations Needed,"The problem with the story is why was Maitland's occupation never explained? His sister Courtney hinted that it may be illegal but, nothing in the plot about it was forthcoming. Is there to be a sequel or what? Why does he have the guns? How does he make his money? Through what kind of investment or is it laudering? Other than the questions it was a good read."
2,Judith where is your magic stylus?,"If you are expecting the usual, can't wait to turn the page read, you will be disappointed in this one. I have read all of her novels many times, but I should have waited for the paperback on this one."
1,Oh Please!!!,"I'm sorry but I hugely disappointed in this book. It purports to be a romantic mystery, but the mystery is insipid at best. The bad guys are the ones who have absolutely no dimension -- of course they are bad, we have no attachment to them and the heros are all beautiful and kind and generous. I know it's fiction, but it has to be a little believeable."
2,What is with the names?,"Judith McNaught has been watching too many soap operas apparently. Where else could she have gotten such insipid names? Paris, Sloan, Noah...oh please!"
1,What happened to Judith McNaught?,"There is no way this book was written by the same person who wrote the wonderful characters and stories in Paradise and Perfect. The dialogue was childish and there were way too many characters and storylines. The ending was so abrupt that I had to check to see that I hadn't skipped any pages. I have read all of Judith McNaught's books and loved them all (except for REMEMBER WHEN, another clunker) so I don't know what the deal is. Please, Judith, go back to your old style!"
2,A disappointment,"I love Judith McNaught but as compared to her earlier works, Night Whispers doesn't even rate. Her main charater, Sloan is poorly built. Yeah, we all know that she's a police officer but... what else? What are her interests, etcetera? Noah wasn't built up well. We all know he's a billionaire but so...? McNaught's style is terribly lacking. At the start, Noah was cynical and arrogant... so how was he able to be kind-hearted and a lvoesick party only after one date? I think this novel is rushed and lacks the proper depth.Judith McNaught, I miss your past works!!!"
2,Lacked character background information on Noah Maitland.,Judith's novels have always warmed my heart with detailed descriptions of the key characters. She failed to provide additional information about Noah Maitland and could have gone into more detail about his business dealings to reveal more about his personality to warm our hearts. This is the only one of her books that I feel lacked the character build-up for a main character. I did not like the murder suspense aspect of the novel which tried to focus on too many story lines.
3,good book but..who proofread this one?,"All of J. Mcnaught's books are good reads and I have yet to be disappointed in any of them but...who ever was suppose to edit this one missed alot and it was very disappointing when you are in the middle of this story and they call the character by another name. This didn't happen once but three times! When it was about ""Paris"" the book would mistakening call the character ""Sloan"". It took something away from the book because I got the impression that it was put togehter quickly."
3,Interesting Story but needs some development,"This is my second Judith book and although I enjoyed it overall, I thought there could be more character development in the story. Once Sloan is tranported to Palm Beach, she does not behave like a cop at all... There are a lot of missing pieces in the story. I would have like the ending expanded. All the characters are interesting, however there were no time to develop them fully. Even Noah and Sloan needed more time."
3,An unsatisfactory end to a great beginning,"For several years I have been a Judith McNaught fan and have read every one of her publications. As usual, they style of her writing was fantastic, bringing her characters to life and making you feel a part of the story. Unfortunately, it seems as if she started this novel with one destination in mind, somehow got lost enroute, and decided that an alternate destination would work just as well!! For instance, Paul Richardson seemed to take an extraordinary interest in Sloan Reynolds (above and beyond the call of duty) in the beginning of the novel, and for no apparent reason it was all business. Jess and Sara should have had their own story. Because I know what Judith McNaught is capable of, I would much prefer QUALITY over QUANTITY!! Fewer novels, with better developed storylines."
3,Not Bad....,"This story had all the elements of a good love story. Handsome rich guy, beautiful hard-working girl, danger, and intrigue. Somehow, the pieces did not come together. Most of the story was about the background stuff. Very little time was devoted to the actual love story. It was rather disappointing because the hero was rather dynamic. Oh Well!"
2,Was This a Romance Novel?,"This book lacked the intensity and pizzazz that we saw in former novels by Ms. McNaught. The overall storyline was good, the main character Sloan was developed very well. However, I did not feel the love interest of Sloan, Noah was developed as well. The reader did not have an opportunity to really bond with Noah. Therefore, the romance in the novel simply wasn't as strong as in other novels. The book spent more time on the subplots of the story than it did on the actual romance element between Noah and Sloan. I found myself wondering if I was reading a true romance novel or a suspense thriller with a little romance thrown in to spice things up. To make matters worse the story ends in a rushed manner that leaves the reader frustrated and dissatisfied. This novel does not deserve to be compared to former novels written by the same author such as Paradise and Perfect. The development of these two stories were far superior to Night Whispers."
2,It was between bad and ok!,"Night Whispers did not have any zing or how do I describe it, powerful emotions maybe? When I read Something Wonderful and Whitney, My Love, I was crying at some parts and the books made me feel like I was there! Night Whispers did not do that. It had a somewhat interesting plot line, but it did not have the stuff from Judith McNaught's previous books. Just borrow it from the library if you want to read it, that is what I did. I recommend reading her previous books. They were what romance novels(historical and contemporary) should be like. I really want Judith McNaught to write more historicals though!"
1,Makes a great coaster,"I bought this book to read on a plane trip. One hundred and fifty pages into the book, I put it down and read the airline magazine instead - the later was more entertaining. If the manuscript for this book had been submitted by a first time author it would have been turned down flat. If you must read this book - borrow it from the library. It definitely isen't a keeper."
1,Quickly Forgotten,"I keep a little journal filled with titles of books I want to read as soon as I get a chance. As soon as I found out Judith McNaught had a new book out of course I added it to my list. Today I went through my journal to find out what I should buy next and I came across Night Whispers still not crossed off of my list...but the title sounded very familiar...haven't I read that already, I asked myself. So I did a quick Amazon.com search to read the plot summary and jogged my memory. In fact, I had read it no more than a month ago and already the story has faded from my mind...the characters dry...the conflict unbelievable...the romantic tension forced... the plot slow...but thankfully quickly forgotten. If you've read all of her books and simply must get this one too...it's definetly a ""library pick!""....taking the time to double cross it off my list right now so in a few years from now when this story has totally deserted my memory I won't mistakenly pick it to read."
2,Don't buy it!,I was very disappionted after reading Night Whispers. I am an avid Mcnaught and have read all her other books at least twice; this is definitely her worst.
1,Major disappointment,"Well, like everyone, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this book and even treated myself to the hardback. What a mistake. With all due respect, Ms. McNaught really didn't take her time with this one. I agree with all the other reviewers who said Night Whispers is just not up to her usual standards and that the characters were so rushed. We never really get to know them or feel their passion. A couple of kisses and a hurried lovemaking left me feeling like an unwanted reader. Her best love scenes usually last several pages. Most of her books leave me actually missing the characters and sneaking peeks at them again while I'm in between books. All of the characters needed more detail, especially Courtney who was a riot. All of her books should be at least 500 pages. Paradise didn't even seem as long as it was because it was so good! Oh well, in the meantime, I'll just reread my favorites! But I won't be rereading this one. Sorry!"
2,a disappointment for this loyal fan,"I have read every Judith McNaught book published, and unfortunately, this is similar to Remember When and not to her earlier novels. Her detailed characterizations used to be outstanding, and now they are only mediocre. Her last few novels have seemed so superficial. The relationship between Sloan and Noah doesn't seem to be based on anything significant at all, and there were many loose ends at the end of the novel. I should have waited for the paperback!"
4,I enjoyed the book very much!,"Judith McNaught is my favorite author. I have all her books. I agree with many of the reviews on Night Whispers, but I think most are being too hard on her. I did think this was going to be more of a suspense-romance, but was more of a romance, and that's o.k. too. This book may not have been up to par with some of her others but I still enjoyed reading it. There really wasn't too much on Noah's character or details on his business. I do hope there will be a book on Jess & Sara and Courtney could have a book of her own. As true fans of JM we want all her books to be the best, but not all books by all authors are the best every time. No matter what, I still enjoyed reading this and hope you all will too!"
3,What happened?,"I was really looking forward to the next book by Judith McNaught. Although, Night Whispers would have been good for another writer, I expected more from her. I didn't really get to emphatize with any of the characters. I was looking forward to more scenes from Paul and Paris, not just a few lines about how they turned out. Also, why tease us with a possible romance between Jess and Sara? Is this an introduction for a story of their own? But I guess no matter how disappointed I am with this last book, I will still buy the next McNaught book!!!"
2,Good but not up to standard,"I was looking forward to JM's new book and when I finished it I was very disappointed. Her characters lacked dimension and I really didn't care much about them. I recommend you borrow it from a friend or library to save money. I hope that Water's Edge is an improvement, you can give me the old historical romances any day...."
1,A disappointment to say the least,"Since my junior year in high school, I have been an avid fan of Ms. McNaught's. She was the one author who could make one trully believe in the power of love and I couldn't wait to devour her novels but this one, this one (and Remember When) left much lacking. I was highly disappointed. I simply couldn't believe that this was a McNaught novel. It felt like a bright flame had burned out. She skipped the courtship and went strait to the bedroom. There was no growth in the relationship between Sloan and Noah. THis story, as far as romance is concerned, was ""Wam Bam, Thank you, Ma'am."" It was so bad and so unlike McNaught, it made me want to cry. I do have hope for her though, and I wait anxiously for another great rendition from the woman who lovingly crafted out stories like ""Perfect"", ""Paradise"", ""Whitney, My Love,"", and ""Kingdom of Dreams"". I only hope that she will write another historical and that it will be just as grand if not even more so then its predecessors."
3,"Good, but not up to Judith McNaught's standards","I enjoyed reading this book, but was not impressed with it. It lacked the emotion and depth that McNaught is famous for. After reading novels like WHITNEY, MY LOVE, PARADISE, and UNTIL YOU, this book was a dissapointment to me, and as I've read, others as well. I'll look foreword to the hopefully soon return of my favorite author."
2,"Not a bad book, but definitely up to Ms McNaught's standards","If you're a first time reader of Judith McNaught's work you probably will enjoy this book. If you are a fan of her previous works, then you will be disappointed. Like ""Remember When"", I did not feel this book lived up to her usually standards. The characters lack their usually depth, although they are not as stale as in ""Remember When."" What I have always enjoyed is the attention to character interaction that Ms McNaught gives her stories. In her last two books I've felt they've have been rushed, and that she has not given them her usual attention to detail. I hope her new book shows a return to her older style of writing. If you are looking for a fantastic contemporary romance I suggest either ""Paradise"" or ""Perfect."" My favorites have always been the historical romances, and for that I suggest ""Almost Heaven"" or ""Something Wonderful"""
5,Refreshing Book!,"This is the first Judith McNaught book that I read and I hate to disagree with those who found it disappointing. I thoroughly enjoyed the story but shared the view that the hero, Noah, might seem a bit arrogant and too full of himself, and he should not deserve such a kind and caring heroine. However, I have to give credit to Ms McNaught's inclusion of the funny characters, Douglas and Courtney. Both of them made me laugh especially the out-spoken teenage Courtney. She bursted out remarks and questions that were embarrassing and unexpected to the audience which caused them a little off-balance. This might sound outrageous but it had the effect of breaking the ever proper and trite atmosphere that adults would conduct in behavior and carry in conversation, making the read more enjoyable and different from other stories. Nice touch, Ms McNaught!"
3,Left Questions at the end....,"O.k., now I must admit that I don't think I have ever read a book by Ms. McNaught before and I probably would not have picked up this one if my mom hadn't given it to me to read....I just felt that the story was not believeable. I mean, who in their right mind would allow the FBI to pressure you into seeing a father you haven't seen in 30 years. I know that I wouldn't. Then there was the ""romance"" between Sloan and Noah...not believeable at all....I can't believe Ms. McNaught actually thought that she was writing about romance and not lust. Then to ending...it ended a little too quick without much descriptions and kind of without purpose. She never tells really why Paul suspected Noah or even why Carter really got involved in the money laundering....a dissappointment...."
1,She's lost me,"I thought Judith McNaught was a great romance wiriter. I still think she has the potential to be great. Perfect and Paradise are two of my favorite books of all time. These books made you care about the charachters and the pairings were spectacular. In comparison ""Remember When"" and ""Night Whispers"" feel like bad blind dates. Couples are only together to service the half-baked plot. No chemistry, no genuine emotion. Why bother? Unfortunatly her new relase looks like much of the same. I'll be skipping it."
3,It was okay but could have been better,"Sloan was a really good character. I loved her and her role in the story. Noah Maitland has a few problems: specifically the fact that his sister, Courtney, made a comment that sounded like he would go to prison if they caught him for something. But he is innocent of all wrongdoing. I loved Courtney best of all. I loved this book it speaks for all books that for some reason are really good but you can't figure out why espescially books with characters as undeveloped as this. The resurfacing of Paul Richards (from Perfect) was a mistake in every sense of the word he of all the characters I have ever read is the most annoying."
4,Night Whispers....,"Judith McNaught has long been one of my favorite authors of romance, and I truly love her books. However, I must agree that the story does not seem to have had enough time to fully develop. Sloan's story is well-developed, however, Noah's history needs more exploration. Despite that, it was a wonderful wonderful read that I finished in one reading because I just could not put it down!"
4,Murder and Betrayal,"In this gripping tale of murder and betrayal, a policewoman, Sloan Reynolds, has never met her father and sister, Paris, until she hears that her father and his associates are suspected of fraud, conspiracy, and murder. Sloan agrees to enter into her father's life while hiding the fact that she is a cop to try and get the goods on her father. Sloan must maneuver through a maze of deceit and passion to try and find someone who she can trust.Night Whispers has too many characters, and a lot of the storyline is left open. The biggest disappointment was to pull us into a relationship between Sara and Jess and leave it undeveloped. Noah's history needed more exploration than it got.Pam @ MyShelf.Com"
3,It was okay but could have been better,Sloan was a really good character and I loved her and her role in the story. Noah Maitland has a few problems specifically the fact that his siter Courtney made a comment that sounded like he would go to prison if they caught him for somthing but he is innocent of all wrongdoing he doesn't make any sense. I loved Courtney best of all she is probaly the character closest to my age (I am 12)I loved this book it speaks for all books that for some reason are really good but you can't figure out why espescially books with characters as undeveloped as this. The resurfacing of Paul Richards (from Perfect) was a mistake in every sense of the word he of all the characters I have ever read is the most annoying.
3,Plan on framing? Beware of sizes...,"Prints quality is as expected for price range, no problem there.However, if you plan on framing these prints wait until you receive them to order your frames. I had 2 frames custom made for these prints and when I received the prints, 3 out of 4 were shorter than listed. 1 Print was dead on at 40.875"", 1 was just under 40"" which I still made work in my custom frame but 2 of them were closer to 39"" rendering my other custom frame useless to them. I had planned on mounting the 2 middle prints of the series and could not because they were not to the specifications listed for the item. Very disappointing...Moral of the story, buy the prints, measure EACH print, then have your frames made."
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't impressed. I expected somthing similar to the cover, but that is not what you get. A few of the chapters are ok but nothing spectacular. Most of the chapters are of rather ugly boring dark fish filmed in front of a artificial background, and the fluttering light from the filter pump above is somtimes distracting. I wanted a HD DVD to showcase my HD tv with, but this is not it."
1,Poor photography really spoils this,"This video was clearly filmed at a public aquarium during regular hours of operation. Frequently, viewers can readily see tourists' reflections in the tank glass, or tourists looking through windows on the other side of the tank. Annoying and distracting.At the very least the video should have filmed this after hours, or an HD underwater camera put in the tank. I've seen the HD underwater photography in ""Planet Earth"" and ""Galapagos"" and it's stunning."
1,jim's review,"Perhaps it is my own fault as I did not read the description carefully enough. I assumed that HD meant High Definition, but it turns out that HD mean it was in a format which would not play on my machine."
4,This brother needs to be watched,"I have just read Roy Glenn's first novel and I thought it was hot, and I loved all the drama. The characters were likeable, and hateable, and that Mike Black, was so sexy . The story was complex and with very satisfing end. This first attempt makes me look forward to his next books. YOU GO BOY"
5,Great Book,"If you like the street and I do. Then you're going to love Is It a Crime. Mike Black and Cassandra Sims had me flipping pages all night. (I think the author owes me a days pay for missing work.) but on the real side I recomend this book to anyone who has a brain white, black or yellow. It's a great book. congradulations roy glenn on a job well done."
2,Predictable,"I thought this was very a predictable book. From the first few chapters you could have it figured out. I was impressed with roy glenn's short story in girls from the hood so I got this book. But this was a Dissapointment, hope the next one i read is better."
