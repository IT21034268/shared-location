1,Terrible,Bad muscianship. Careless execution. So so sound and video. Why this guy is considered a rock 'star' is beyond me.
1,Maxell Audio CDRs Now Poor Quality!,"Buyer beware: this is no longer the same product. Maxell has recently changed their audio CDRs. Formally, they were manufactured in Japan; now they are made in Taiwan. All the older Maxell discs would play in EVERYTHING. However, a large percentage of discs in this new CDR media are defective. The new discs will no longer play in my Panasonic boom box or in my Honda car stereo. Worse, some of these CDs will fail to play in anything after a few days."
5,ONLY CDR's I EVER Use!,"I started burning my own CDR's 5 years ago when I finally got a stereo-unit CD burner. I've mainly only been making mix CD's for my friends and compilation CD's to trim down the size of my extensive CD collection. By far, these Music CDR's from Maxell are THE BEST out there! Over the years, I've had very few problems with them, whereas with other brands I can't even begin to list the problems I've had without getting dizzy from the sheer astronomical number of problems.The only problem I have, is that these CDR's are getting harder and harder to find. 4 years ago I was able to pick up 10 packs of them(in standard-sized jewel cases, which I prefer) at any Walmart or K-Mart in my area. Now I have to resort to searching for them online. I want to stock up on them before they are completely discontinued, and I highly suggest that everyone else out there who's interested in TOP-QUALITY CDR's do the same!"
1,The Newer Maxell are now Junk CD's,"I used to buy these all the time. They were made in Japan and had a bluish dye to them, and when you held them up to the light, you couldn't see through them. I never had a bad burn.The newer ones are now made in Taiwan. They have a silver dye and are see-through when held up to the light. These CD's suck. Don't buy them."
5,quality of the recordings,So far every blank cd has recorded perfectly and without any problems. I highly reccomend this product for duplicating your valuable collection of music.
5,Always my preferred brand,"I have been using the Maxell Music CD-Rs ever since I bought a CD recorder, and rarely get a bad disc."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed that the spindle of cds was broken and several of the cd's were broken and unusable. I will not purchase from this vendor in the future since I cannot depend on the quality of the product received.
5,Maxell Music Recorable CD's,"If you record music at all and use anything else shame on you. I can save you the trouble as I have tried ALL other brands and none even come close. Now, I am sure that Maxell is owned by somebody else at this point but this product stands the test of time. They made great blank tapes and they make great blank CD's. Except no substitute.If they only still made the 50 pack. Get them while you can."
3,Blank Music Purchases,"One of the casings, on the bottom of the cd package, was damaged and fell apart when I opened it. Even though the cd's were suppose to be ""new"", the first five (5) on top of the stack had some type of defect. I was still able to use them but I was definitely concered about their ""reliability"". The cd packages only had an ""outside"" wrap and did not have an ""inside"" wrap, which they usually had on my past orders. Everything else in my order was found to be ""okay""."
1,unreliable discs,"I burn about 50 CDs a week in live music trades. I can tell you from experience that these discs do not last. After a year or so, they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems. Any scratches that they have only make it worse. I recommend using Sony, Fuji, or TDK. All the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don't stand the test of time. So if you care about preserving your CDs, don't use these ones."
3,anyone,"one song that i like on this movie, a really cool dance,trance song..is being played when there getting stoned...if anyone knows the name please post it."
4,Pioneer Truth Teller......,"I follow the teachings of Ernest Holmes, Science of Mind and also read the book, Three Magic Words by Anderson all of which have the same message. I recommend all of the above including this one.This book is written with a simple messege of universal truths to live by and a provides a way of training your mind, to help you live the kind of life you want. You are put in control of your thoughts and of your words which are both very powerful. You create your life using them so use them wisely.She is one, if not the first person to realize and write about these simple universal truths and was well respected in New York in her time. This book is timeless. It promotes peace, success, and gives examples to practice so you can live a happier life."
5,Excellent,This is another inspiring author who is spiritually gounded. Her book is written in a timely manner relevant to her times and to today.
3,Speaking of the Spoken Word,"The Power of the Spoken Word was far advanced for the time it was written, and obviously part of the foundation for the modern law of attraction books currently making the rounds. Sometimes it's good to go back to our roots and find that these powerful techniques of manifesting were known before we were born. I enjoyed the perspectives and the reminders that we need to be aware of what we say in all aspects of life. This book rivals any metaphysical book on the subject. It is written plainly and straightforwardly, an attribute often missing in modern writing. I would recommend it to anyone who is exploring their spiritual power. The fact that it was written by a woman in a time when women's power was often curtailed is particularly impressive to me."
3,The power of the spoken word,"It's good, and gives many good pointers, however the author explains everything from her religious beliefs and it may be off putting to some like me that don't share them. However, I read the entire book."
3,The Power of the Spoken Word,"Although full of wisdom and truth, the book is poorly written and apparently written just as one would speak it.If you are already a fan of Florence Shinn, you'll undoubtedly want to read this book too."
2,Power of the Spoken Word,"Packed with superstitions and stupidity. Might be somewhat helpful for the growing adolescent mind if it were not for inherent contradictions and outright ridiculous statement. A small minded belief in the bible as the word of God distorts and clouds thoughts that might otherwise have at least superficial entertainment value for a child. However it can be a mildly interesting study of the primitve ""religious"" reality structure of the authors social group. (Middle class early 20th C US type.)"
4,Can't believe the value,"This item shipped very fast and I got it for about $35. The stones are large and are set well in the necklace. This is my sister-in-law's school color and her son's birthstone, so I thought it would make a nice Christmas gift. My only complaint is that the chain is very delicate and you can't just slip it out and replace it with a sturdier one. Overall the necklace is a bit fancy, so probably not an everyday item (especially with a toddler at home)."
3,not the famous recording - a later recording,"In the 1970s Paillard with his chamber orchestra made a recording with Adre and Rampal as soloists in the Brandenburg Concertos. This recording is a later digital recording by the same conductor without Andre and Rampal. It is a good performance, but that is all. Of the definitive earlier performance with Rampal and Andre, only the performance of Brandenburg # 2 is readily available in an anthology. The complete recording is available from Amazon in Japan. It is on Denon. I recommend interested parties to purchase it while it is still available. For those who must have it on CD, this is the only alternative to purchasing a used copy of the LP and having a CD rom made of it."
3,Good Single but...,"I was expecting to hear Trina on this single and was disappointed to find she wasn't on there. This single is still good, but it's missing that one element."
3,not a bad track,"this is something to get the party started missy and trina talking about oral sex, and wanting a man who's packing and with some stamina in the bedroom and also ludacris pops up worth a listen."
1,Fat and untalented missy.,"Warning!!!Warning!!! this cd is pure crap and a real waste of money.Why in the hell would anybody pay $15.00 dollars for only 3 songs.Lets use some common sense and be smart consumers.This is just another missy scheme to rob you of your money.All the songs sound the same,with the same simple beats and ridiculous lyrics.Stop supporting this fat,lazy,ugly and greedy woman anymore.This lady is a real eyesore and I wish that she would get banned from appearing on tv or radio anymore.Vote for my review."
5,"Unique incomparable album, Fashion's best.","This is the old album Fabrique, on CD, with the Mutant mixes which were either original 12"" b-sides or the extra tracks from the bonus cassette (yeah, cassette tape!) version. Incredible stuff, years ahead of their time. In the midst of a period when everybody was picking a category to fit into, these guys went their own way. This album was the ultimate fusion of music styles, funky bass, digital drums played by a real drummer with real drumsticks, incredible synth programming and soulful vocals. I can listen to some 80's stuff, once or twice, but can happily leave this to repeat all day long."
5,Height of Fashion,"Probably the band Fashion is not formost on your mind.Why? Under rated as this band seems to be they pack a wallop when it comes to ""hook"" time; might I say. Please add this one to your eclectic CD collection for the sake of great music. Believe it or not they have about twelve CD's out. Get hip and enjoy great tunes."
2,Fashion,"While this compilation is a good representation of Fashion's techno period it is sadly lacking in tracks from their previous reggae-infused punk period when Luk Sky was lead vocalist. While I'm sure licensing across controlling labels was a factor, songs such as ""Die In The West"", ""Product Perfect"" and ""The Innocent"" deserve to be heard. At the very least it would show the evolution of this band that hung around longer than most bands of the era, changing their own sound as the market they played to also changed.--Bill Gowdy""Mr. Bill's I.R.S. Corner""www.irscorner.com"
4,Good vacuum for the money,"Very good suction, fairly lightweight. The cord is a bit short, but my house is small so it isn't a big problem. I added an extension cord to make it longer. It can be a bit difficult to pull it along behind you; you need to yank on it a little. Overall, I'm pleased with it's performance. A few extra tools would have been nice, like a smaller brush for carpeted stairs, but I use the upholstery brush and that works pretty well on cat hair, etc. The big beater bar that comes with it does a very good job on cat hair as well."
2,Powerbrush has failed twice,"After 6 months the Powerbrush failed and was replaced for free, that brush lasted 10 months before it too failed. The cost of the replacement is more than the original vacuum! Also the suction capability of the cleaner was less than desirable. Bag-less is nice, but overall it's a disappointment and now useless."
2,breaks easily,The attachments break off easily and for no good reason. Parts are hard to find. Highly not recommended.
1,No suction,"What is the use of the powerfull motor if there is virtually no suction ?I have to clean the canister and filter after cleaning each bedroom even though suction is almost nonexistent. Today I noticed that just after I cleaned the filter it even could not pick up a grass from the hardwood floor.The hose broke off after a year of use, shorcutting wires that go the the powerbrush.On the bright side it looks good is quiet and does not feel flimsy.The bottom line: This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made."
2,"Clean well, but hard to be cleaned","Pros:1. Does the job well, although could be betterCons:1. Short power cord. If you think you have a small apartment or room and the short cord doesn't bother you, it REALLY does, trust me.2. The cord retracts on its own, even when you don't trigger it to be retracted.3. Noisy.4. It's bagless, so you can expect to do clean some parts on your own... but this one is pretty hard to clean, and there're 2 parts that you need to clean. So while you're cleaning the filters, you mess up your floor again, and I guarantee it. I guess the reason why Dyson is expensive is because it saves you that hassle for going bagless."
2,Loved it - Hated it,"I own a small residential cleaning company and bought two of these. They worked great on carpet, and they look pretty cool, too. Easy to open to get rid of the dirt and debris and not too loud. But both broke within 2 months. Both of the hoses pulled away (fixed with a hose clamp) and the way the debris container fits into the body of the vacuum - you have to tilt it very slightly then pull it out - it was a given that someone was going to pull it straight out and break off the little plastic piece eventually - which they did. Going for something a little more substantial next time, although I think these might be good for someone with mostly carpeting, who lived in a ranch-style house with only one floor (a bit heavy to carry up stairs)."
2,not really good,We purchased this vacuum cleaner and at first we were very pleased about it but now after all???No way because it doesn't pick up dog hair because after you clean and you wipe over the carpet with your hand you still get so much dog hair that you can knit a sweater so this vacuum cleaner is certainly not recommanded for dog owners
3,Good vacuum with one significant problem,"I like almost everything about this vacuum. It works well on carpet, seems to be built well, and has a smallish powerhead (12""), which works well in tights spots.The one glaring omission: A standard ""floor nozzle."" You can turn off the brush on the powerhead, but it doesn't work well for the tight spots, edges, etc., like a floor nozzle would. Normally this would be no big deal--I'd just use a floor nozzle from another vacuum. But other tools don't fit the Sanyo's nonstandard attachment size. And according to Sanyo's customer service, they do not make a floor nozzle to fit this unit."
1,Don't waste your money.,"We got this vacuum as a wedding present and within the first 5 minutes of use, it completely died. The on/off switch no longer functioned--we tried different outlets, etc. It had not tripped a circuit and the plug was firmly in the wall (the two ""solutions"" Sanyo suggests), so the problem had to be with the vacuum itself. The nearest Sanyo service center was over 20 miles from our house, and we don't have a car, so getting it repaired is a total hassle. Don't expect any sympathy from Sanyo on this one. There are a lot of other reviewers here who have had the same problem, so take our advice and don't buy this piece of crap."
1,Don't make the same mistake I made!!,"This unit is heavy and awkward.Three months after I purchased it, the on-off switch stopped working. Sanyo's nearest service location is more than one hour from where I live. I called their customer service center and they refused to show any flexibility regarding service (ie, they would not pay for me to ship it to a repair center, nor would they authorize repairs at a nearby appliance repair center). The customer service representative was unsympathetic and refused to offer to allow me to speak with her supervisor.Avoid purchase of Sanyo vacuum cleaners to avoid similar problems."
1,Sanyo SC-X1000P Canister Vacuum,"My wife and I have used this machine for several weeks now. We found it to be a great machine for the price. Others complained about the lack of attachments because of the odd size of the wands, so I immediately machined an adapter that allows us to use any tool from most other American Vacuums. Now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on. This thing is lite, strong, and easy to empty. The cord retractor is a little lite so I wouldn't be to rough with it. Garrett and Susan"
5,"Good suction, powerful brush picks up everything!",Good suction. It is just too big and heavy for me. I expected it to be smaller. But does the job-that's what matters!
1,Worst vacuum I ever owned,"This vacuum looks great and promises a lot. But it doesn't deliver. The unit is heavy, stiff, and awkward to move around---this applies especially to the wand. The powerhead is too big, making it hard to maneuver into smaller places. The dust cup is rather complicated to detach and empty. WORST OF ALL IS THE SUCTION---there is very little suction (unless my unit was defective; a possibility, considering how crappy the suction was). I often had to pass over the same crumb multiple times to get the thing picked up. I was so unhappy with this vacuum that I practically gave it away."
4,Love it!,"Great vacuum! I hated my dirt devil. This has great suction for a good price. I have all hardwood floors and a few rugs. It picks up all the dirt and dog hair. It also has good attachments and is easy to empty. I am so glad that I chose a bagless vacuum! I don't have to worry about changing bags and I can just take out the filter and rinse it in the sink when needed. I would be changing bags almost every use, thanks to my golden retriever, but with this emptying is a snap!The only improvement I'd make is a longer cord, but it's not that much of an inconvience. I also had trouble reattaching the canister at first because I didn't read the directions. It caused me to get poor suction the first few times I used it. After I figured it out, I never had another problem.I would highly recommend it to anyone. In fact, my mother just bought one after seeing how happy I am with mine. She has all carpet and a black lab...so I'm interested to see how it works for her."
4,My picker upper,"Having a cage of birds placed next to floor lengh windowm there was always( I mean daily ) a mess. An upright couldn't do the job.So therefore a different type was essential and this Sanyo fits the bill. It scoops up the feathers and seeds in a breeze. Over and under without a problem. The birds like it too, they sing along with the motor. When it stops they stop. I am glad to say it's here to stay. Carolyn"
4,sanyo sc-x1000p bag=free 12-amp powerhead canister vacuum cleaner.,"The little vacuum that could! This vacuum is ideal for a house that dosn't have alot of wall to wall carpeting. It is light weight, easy to manuver up stairs and dusting ceilings, furniture, hard to reach places like under the bed. Light weight to vacuum the car. The carpet beater attachment is plenty big and has a headlight on it so you can see under the bed. I like the retracting cord feature. and no more bags! It works and empties easily. It also stores compactly and is a fine looking machine. If I could redesign it I would add a liitle more power and make the dusting attachments a little bigger the cord a little longer but then it would weigh more. All in all I love it Can't beat it for the price."
1,Okay until it died after about 5 hours of using it.,"It's large, heavy and makes a lot of noise while it's running. Don't even think about touching it while it's running. It gets down right hot to the touch. This unit might have been good about twenty years ago but don't waste your money on this one today. It would be a garage sell find at a buck but not worth the money at this price. To top it all off, it died after my second Rock Band Party. You can pass on this one and you won't miss a thing."
4,Great deal (buy a couple at this price),This light was very nice for the money. We used it at a rave dance party along with some other lights. This one was aimed at the ceiling and it looked cool. Ran all night with no problems. I recommend using 2 or 3 together for a nice effect or to complement other more expensive lights.
3,Decent for the money,"Decent light for the money its not real bright almost impossible to see without using a fog machine, But like I said decent for the money"
4,Awesome!,So ordered these lights despite the reviews and i thought they were great!.. you did have to change the reflector because it comes stock white. They provide you with a multi color too. It wasnt that hard to install. idk what that person was talking about that said it was super hard when it wasnt. Im giving this 4 stars because it is a great light but it gets really hot super fast. Used this light with my fog machine and it looks sick! Had a small little party at my house and it did the job!
2,"i got two, one looked like it was slammed on the ground but still works","would not buy again because you are supposed to keep turning off and on every fifteen minutes because it gets hot which is lame, i got a couple electronic timers that have 15 minute intervals to remedy the problem but id prefer being able to comfortably leave my lights on for a few hours at a time not fifteen minutes.. also you have to install the colored effects and i just dont like the design that much... would give it two and a half stars but cant so just two, cant give it three..."
3,works great but !!!,item worked great for a little while then the bulb went i mean like a hr little while very hard to contact the company and ask them if they will send me a new bulb being it was only a few hrs still waiting to see if they will
4,Good for the Price,"This light is a good deal for the price. I probably wouldn't buy it for everyday professional use, but it is perfect for holiday displays or the occassional party."
4,Be careful!,"This item did not spin continuously or react to sound when I plugged it in, minutes after I opened the package. After a few hours of fiddling with it, I decided to pay no attention to fact that you weren't suppose to open the lense while it is plugged in and running. There, where the fixture is suppose to rotate, I gave it a little nug and it began to fill its purpose. I believe it was I wasn't CAREFUL enough when opening the packge so I must have tapped it on something that made it all confused.Despite this, the light really sets a fun atmosphere for a party or concert. This is a product I am very pleased with."
3,Exactly what I needed,"The Moonbeam is exactly what I needed. It isn't a centerpiece but it's an excellent addition to a decent light show. You really need a fog machine for this to be much more than lights on the celling.It worked perfect right out of the box. It includes 3 different sets of mirrors but you will have to open the unit to change these so decide ahead of time what will look good.It comes with a 3-way switch that has always on, sound activated and stoped. You have to unplug it for it to be off. Weird I know but I'll wire in an online switch later.This unit is basically a lightbulb with a motor to turn the mirror. It runs pretty hot so be aware of this when you look for a place to set it up.It comes in an all metal housing with a good mounting bracket included. I just used a c-clamp so I could remove it easily when I was done.Like I said with a fog machine the moonbeam looked good and overall it worked beautifully.."
1,"Bad light, not worth it even for the price",Bought this for my mobile DJ set-up. I went to test it out as soon as I received it and noticed it had three different mirrors that you physically have to unscrew and screw back in in order to change the colors of the lights. Not too big of a deal but the one that came already screwed in was in there so tight I couldn't remove it. Decided I would just try it with the white lights it comes with and it started smoking within 1 minute of it being turned on. Some of the reviews I read prior to purchasing it said it ran hot but I didn't think it was that hot! I returned it the next day...
4,Good CD! Disturbing skits! BUT STILL GOOD!!,"This CD is freaking halarious! I laughed a whole bunch. I'm a big Adam Sandler fan and this is the first cd of his that I got. The first time I listened to this cd it disturbed me a little bit. Especially ""The Boss And The Secretary."" The Best Songs on here are ""Secret"", ""Stan the man"", and ""Mayor of P***ytown""! And The Mayor song isn't like you may think. It took me by suprise. This CD rules! A highly suggested cd!"
2,Where's the funny?,"This CD is disappointing. Sandler peaked early with ""They're All Gonna Laugh At You"" and has been going steadily downhill ever since. There are a few funny tracks on here, but most are just ho-hum."
3,shhh...tell everyone,"now i love adam sandlers first 3 cds. expessially 3. But i knew he was slipping on stan and judys kid. i just bought shhh...dont tell. I wish i would have downloaded it. the skits arnt funny and there only a couple good songs.... ""the mayor of p@$$y town"" and ""stan the man"".....i dont know about everyone else but ide rather hear more songs, than skits because they are always funny. and skits are a one time listening...in conclusion go out and buy ""whats your name"".."
3,eh,"His first two cd's were definetly the best, and he went a little downhill with stan and judy's kid. And Shhh..Don't tell isn't any better. Some parts are funny but a lot of it is just stupid. I hate to say it cause i love the man, but thats how it is."
1,Shhh...Don't tell,"I just bought this CD and it was the worst CD ever put out by Adam Sandler. I am a real fan of Adam Sandler but this was pathetic. I figured out why the title is call Shhh...Don't tell, it's because Shhh...Don't tell anyone that this is a piece of crap so others will buy it. I am sorry Adam but I know you can do better than this."
1,unreliable seller. I did not get the product I paid for.,I had to request my money back from amazon because I never got my purchase... very dissapointed with seller!
5,Great book,This book is a must have for those who want to learn to lace knit or are looking for interesting patterns
1,Troy Lite,"I echo the other comments made here. From the packaging, it was unclear to me that one of the discs was only about Sparta. That is the more interesting disc, but not what I was looking for here. It seemed familiar because I had seen it on TV not too long ago.The disc on Troy is totally disappointing. The Nimoy show (Ancient Mysteries) is chaotic and tries too create too much . . . well, mystery. I watched the third show on the disc a couple of days later and I was having a deja vu experience - the pictures and the script were often identical; just a different narrator! Ouch! That is a rip off. The second show, on the gold of Troy, was interesting, but the 10 minutes of content are excruciatingly dragged out over 45 minutes of show."
2,Entertaining mystery with underwhelming ending,"Pages 1-180 are a fun, entertaining read. Subsequently, you begin to worry that there is no awaiting twist of fate or surprise ending in the final pages. Instead, the obvious person is arrested for the crime and on page 185 the book ends with a fizzle."
4,wrong description!,"Be careful, this station is only for output to TV or Amplifier!It has no USB connector to PC.Remote is small, but I think no problem to learn my Sony remote.My device is black. No white stripe like shown on photo.Special plug AC adapter is 110-240V range with 5V 1A output (like usual USB charger). I do not understand why do not use standard USB cable for charging from any USB port?Four star only for non present USB connector."
5,Great Stan!!!,This artist is a true man of words and music. This is a sort of a change from what her usually does. But still superior. He is touring now. SEE HIM if you can.
5,"""In Too Deep"" is an excellent book.","This book is very exciting. I'd recomend it to any-one. Jennie's chemistry teacher dies, and the Police thinkit's suicide, Jennies finds out that it's not. She convivcesthe Police that it is murder. But now she must find out whodid it and why because she is in too deep."
3,Missing something....,"i purchased this album after hearing ""jean lafitte"" and ""san pedro"" on the radio. i really liked the sound and had high hoped for the rest of the album. after hearing the cd once, i was a little dissapointed. the intensity i had heard on the radio did not cary through to the rest of the songs. about half of the songs on the album are slow, uninteresting and non-distinguishable from eachother. some of the lyrics feel just plain lazy to me. i too often find myself spacing out listening to it and not rembering what i had heard. maybe i am being a little bit harsh on this group, but it is just because i feel they can do much better with their obvious tallents. i love the sound they create and look forward to seeing them live, but i couldnt recomend this to a friend."
2,Not for 2nd generation nano,"nice product... but not for 2nd generation nano, it does not fit. Does not have a clip or place to hook a neck cord."
3,ipod case,"description is totally wrong. it said that it fitted the 2nd generation ipod, when i got it, it didn't. it only fits 1st generation. other than that, great product. beautiful color. horrible delivery time though. took about 3 weeks to get here."
1,not so good,"This product arrived packaged so you can see the cool metal sheen and it looked great when I put it on. However, the case prevents the ear phone plug from fully engaging resulting in the music cutting out. The case isn't molded well to the shape of the ipod such that it pops off if you put any pressure on the top or bottom (like when it's in your pocket). I took it off and have not used it since the first day... essentially a waste of my $18."
1,VERY disappointed,"I had been looking for the right case for ages. When i found this one I thought great. I live in the UK, so when I was going on holiday to the US I decided to order it. It arrived on time, it looked perfect. I opened it and tried to put my nano g2 inside it, only to discover it didn't fit."
5,WOW - works perfectly for me,I have security cameras and my 3 monitors were hooked up to a switch (see photo: SONY 3-way AV selector switch) but I had to manually switch from 1 monitor to the other. There had to be a better way. I read the review on this amp and gave it a try. Works great! All 3 monitors are 'live' all the time. No more manual switching. My only surprise was the amp needed a power source. No transformer was included but that's OK I have a 12V system for the security cameras and powered the amp from the Altronix box (which I also highly recommend).
5,"""The Lift"" Fantastic Vocals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I was in a night club in San Francisco Ca. when I heard the title track ""the lift"" off ""The Lift EP""The vocals were amazing!!!! That girl can really sing!!! The song had a fantastic beat and the club was jumping. I had to go and ask the DJ who the vocalist was and what the name of the album was. The vocalist Maria Johnston was a solo artist on the song. the mix of vocals with special effects is the best example of a techno/house/dance I have ever heard. With a bit of an exotic feel on the middle eastern tip and several FAT layers of the DIVA's vocals make this EP a must buy. On the dance floor the Vocals dance and swirl around you, wrapping you in a blanket of euphoria!!!!!!!!!! LOOK OUT "" THE CRYSTAL METHOD"" Here comes MEPHISTO ODYSSEY!!!If you don't buy it you are missing out!!!"
5,Great Foucauldian discussion of science and state in India,"This book is a better example of the use of Foucauldian analysis in a non-Euro/American setting. Prakash's discussion of how the colonial state used science to legitimate its rule, and how the nationalist anticolonial elites redefined and reinscribed science to legitimate their own goals is very thorough. He applies Foucault's notion of ""governmentality"" to demonstrate how science operated to control and maintain the populace. Highly recommended."
5,Not Science but more...,"This not about science as such, but about the idea of science. This is one of best recent academic books that I have read on modern India. Using science as a window into the culture of modern India, or Indian modernity, Prakash provides a captivating account of how areas ranging from museums to religion to politics were refashioned. The book is also very elegant, starting with the cool cover, the well chosen chapter epigraphs, and chapter titles. You will come away with a very thoughtful, nuanced understanding of how the idea of science entered the constitution of colonial India. One last thing, though Prakash's approach is what would be called ""postcolonial,"" it is solidly grounded in Indian materials while being very stylish. A real treat!"
5,Amazing CD,"This CD is amazing, I really enjoy all the different aspects, especially taking the old traditional songs like Four Green Fields and giving them a more modern vibe. I recommend buying it directly from the artist, like the other review mentioned, as you will save a lot of money, and directly support the artist. And yes, she will sign them if asked.A must for any celtic or world music fan."
4,The book provides a much need theoretical perspective.,"I also have sisterlocks and consider them worth it after years of looking for a natural hair style. It is not a how-to book and does not pretend to be. Instead it offers a history of black hair conflicts in a racialized world. It is written for an average reader, but it addresses and offers several theoretical perspectives that are important for anyone interested in issues affecting marginalized cultures. This probably sounds too academic but the book is really easy to read and refreshing. There are many photographs that help you understand the possibilities and range of styles that sisterlocks offers. I was not looking for a how-to book and so I was very satisfied."
2,Nothing New,"My biggest complaint about this book is that there are no color photos of the ""Siterlock"" style. A FAQ section would also have been helpful as well as more photos of women with different hair lengths and textures wearing Sisterlocks. The first part of the book you can read in any of the recent natural hair books that are out now, the second part you can read on the sisterlocks website. Save yourself twenty bucks."
1,Disappointed in Tulsa,"The styles in this book are great, but it is disheartening to know that unless I travel hundreds of miles I will never be sisterlocked. Perhaps the author can come up with another book that gives the thousands of women who embrace natural hair, other more available options."
2,Sisterlocks Approach,"This is my first couple of weeks with sisterlocks. I'm very happy with my style, no perm was my goal. Please enlarge your writings size in your book. I am also looking for other syles. How do I find more information on classes concerning sister locks, instructions and hair care products? Moisturizer and the like! What magazines are your styles in?"
2,A Good Book.,"I enjoyed this book, though not as much as ""No Lye!"" or ""Where Beauty Touches Me"". Sisterlocks is a fantastic alternative to regular dreadlocks. I was a little dissapointed that the book didn't have a FAQ section. I'm curious about how often they have to be redone , how to maintain the locks between tightening sessions,and how the locks look on 100% natural hair. Besides that, it is a good (not great) book. They also have a website if you want to check it out there before committing to the book."
2,Infomercial Please.,"I am very interested in getting Sisterlocks of my own so I was very happy to see this book come out. I've read a lot of books already about the ""black hair thing"" and I was hoping this would be more like Pam Ferrell's ""Where Beauty Touches Me"" instead of all the personal narrative. I still enjoyed it, however I'll probably have to settle for a similar lock style since I live in Canada. I would have like it more if the author showed some alternative styles. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed that I can't find a Sisterlock ""technician"" in my area to do my hair."
3,warm jacket,I like the jacket but I should have ordered a size LG.It is NOT roomy through the lower hip/thigh region.The jacket also has a hood tucked into the collar area which makes the collar unable to lie flat.
5,Great Memories,I owned a lot of Trini on vinyl--that was 45 years ago man--it just wore out--now I have it back--great old music with the latest technology--thanks for that--great songs-great artist
2,Deadwood Revival,"This CD has nothing to do with Deadwood or a revival of Deadwood. There is nothing outstanding about this music, just average."
5,Symbols of Transformation,"This is not an easy read, but it is worth the time and effort. I have a link to Dictionary.com and purchased a Latin translation program to help me through. I have notes all over the margins and have to read and reread and reread paragraphs to follow Jung's train of thought. The book is a lot of work, but it is fascinating, and nothing this good ought to be easy. You will get back everything you put in, but it requires committment."
3,difficult for beginners,"This is a version of the book that ended Jung's relationship with Freud, for it discloses a series of dream (and other kinds of) symbols interpreted synthetically rather than reductively. Interesting for those into exploring the early Jung but definitely not for those new to his thought."
2,not as good as the picture,"Pendant appeared as stated, Chain extremely knotted upon arrival which required a long delicate de-tangling effort. Chain itself was unacceptably thin. We ended up purchasing a separate thicker chain to improve both the looks and durability of the piece."
4,review,"Took forever to get here, but its a good product. I love how it keeps the water hot, but it doesn't actually massage it. ): Overall, GREAT product."
2,The British lose the battle- but are the heroes,"The author has taken some pains to be evenhanded, but does not quite make it. The great hero/woodsman of the book is A BRITISH OFFICER! Even though he participates in several losing battles with the ""rebels"", he always manages to kill a few just before he retreats. Even though it is the colonies that are being invaded by the British army, it is the colonists who are the ones who commit atrocities- on hapless loyalists. The only atrocities commited against the Americans are done by the evil savage, untrustworthy Indian allies. The British soldiers are given a human face, cheerful in the face of adversity. The colonials (except for the artist, who is not a soldier) are pretty much cardboard figures, fueding, vain, petty, for instance, for not giving Arnold his due, who is pictured as a madman, anyway. If you want to cheer for the British, read this book."
3,What is St. Martin's thinking?,"I make no comment on the book, as I have yet to read it but I hold out little hope for any historical accuracy for a book titled Saratoga to have the battle of Princeton on its cover. Didn't anyone at the publisher notice George Washington figured prominently in the center of the battle. Washington was not at Saratoga, Gates and Arnold were in command. The battle shown on the cover is a rather famous depiction of the battle of Princeton. There are enough paintings of Saratoga that there is no excuse for this oversight."
3,An introductory text,"The book is an introductory text to Windows NT written in simple and engaging style. It introduces the basics, hardly deep enough to really run an NT server. Hence the low rating. It will not make NT system administrator of you. If you aspire to be one, Inside Windows NT Server is a book to read."
4,jumper start for NT beginner,"I just finished reading this book borrowed from Central Library, actually I still want to renew it, but another guy has booked it. Considering its one volume, it has covered from basic domain management to enterprise master domains trust. It's easy to understand with quite a number of graphics and illustration. It's a basic reference book on your bookshelf if you don't need too much in-depth knowledge of NT."
4,Fantastic Primer,I thought the book was chock full of useful information. I started with a blank hard drive and a cardboard box full of software and with my keyboard in one hand and the book in the other I had my NT 4 Server up and running an Intranet Web home page on IIS 4.0 via my new Ethernet LAN in just a few days. This is a great book to buy if you are starting from scratch and you haven't yet decided to spend the extra money to buy the NT 4 Server Resource Kit.
3,Good quick reference if you do not need in depth answer,"Good addition to a personal bookshelf if you are an aspiring MCP. The book does not really have any depth to it, but is is valuable as a handy reference. I wanted more detailed information than this book provided when it came to name / address resolution. Overall value is three and a half stars."
4,"Nice, but only fits BMX flip-flop hubs, not standard hubs","Bought this for my singlespeed mountain bike without realizing it has a smaller thread that won't fit ""standard"" freewheel hubs. Only buy this if you know you have a ""flip-flop"" bmx style hub with tiny threads on one side, not a track type flip-flop hub."
5,"At last, I have IT !!!","Like the previous book, I have not read it yet but can't wait.Love the subject and David Irving's writing on WW2 is second to none."
1,Beware. Holocaust Denier!!!,"Amazon has done a good job of hiding the fact that this writer is a Holocaust denier. Why would Amazon not reveal this fact? It makes any analysis by him of Hitler completely untrustworthy (and the guy must be a nut)!I didn't realise he was a Holocaust denier, until a workmate pointed this out -- so I'm returning my new purchase. But I'm doubly annoyed because I purchased this based upon a recommendation by Amazon -- it's the last time that happens. You've been warned."
3,III Reich revisited,"When i read that Irving was imprisoned for his books instead of being beated by better historians, I just asked to myself wether we are living in the IV Reich.I dont like him, i dont like his opinions, i dont like his books, but if the only answer we can give is to put them in jail...Will be next step to put revisionists a black star or another visible signal in their arms like the Nazis did with the so called undesirable minorities?Er...the review, yes...the book is worthless"
1,Irving's Trial,"Irving recently plead guilty to denying the Holocaust and, as of February 20th, is facing 3 years in prison. Is that really who you want writing a history of WWII?"
4,Do Not Imprison Your Thoughts,"How dare they! If a man's ideas and thoughts do not cause violence, who are they to imprison his body? Why restrict his ideas? What are they afraid of? Allow the scholars to refute his research and stop burning books by imprisoning the authors.A unique approach to history and worthy of testing your convictions. Do you have strong convictions that can withstand a different viewpoint?"
4,Probably best one track,I think this CD contain on of the best DJ Cam's single track. Which one is it? Buy it and figure that out.
2,Eject Button Stopped Working,"At first I was pleased with this project. I used it to install all the software I needed from CDs on my Samsung NC10 netbook. I have not tried using it to write DVDs or CDs. However, after only infrequently using this unit over the past few months, the eject button is apparently broken. The only I can get the door open is to pry it open with my hands. That works, but it's not ideal."
2,Good Idea -- Flimsy quality.,"Well First of all, if you buy a slim drive most likelly its because you plan to carry it around but the case of this drive is just too weak. if you hold it by the top to close the drive, the plastic is so weak it bends down preventing the drive from closing. The drive inside it was a Sony drive, but for some reason, it WONT read CDRW disks unless you use the external AC adapter (tried with several systems and all possible solutions found in forums including firmware updates). Now some good things: basically no problem to get it recognized by XP, Very quiet operation (considering other laptop drives i've heard). Conclusion: Not recomended unless you are a very very careful person and dont want to use it to write or read cds (DVDs work great)"
1,"worthless, WinXP cant see it","Same as other customer. Ive struggled for weeks now, to make this drive work on my Sony Vaio w/ WinXP. Same error, ""USB device not recognized or malfunctioned."" Ive tried every drive I could find on the planet, to no avail. And BrilliantMedia's web site is no help. Giving up."
1,DO NOT BUY IT !!!,"I bought this product I month ago and I have not been able to use it. It says it is corrupted even though I have the system requirements Windows XP. This is not plug and play!!!! What a waste of money.... now too late o return! YOU do not waste your money too!!! BTW, I tried it on many laptops and desktops and it just doesn't work"
1,"would be great, if....","I bought this affordable drive and tried to use it on my XP laptop at home and my XP desktop at work. Both have all the recent service packs and updates, but the device will not start. Plug and Play reports it as an unknown usb device.I'm going to have to send it back. I'd go with a recognized Plug and Play compliant manufacturer."
4,Review,I used this in helping me understand The Bluest Eye. Bluest Eye is a well wrought work that is complex in its details and I needed this aid to comprehend and better understand this masterpiece.
5,I learned so much!,"This book shows such a variety of artifacts from the Revolutionary War, it's just amazing! All of the photographs and illustrations are very clear and it makes it easy to really understand what things were like back then."
5,Taxation Without Represeentation,"The book is non fiction. The plot is that the British are doing taxation without representation in the 1700s.My favorite things in the book are some of the battles it tells about, like the Battle of Long Island. I also like the book because of all the facts it has and all the information. The flag illustrations are cool too.I highly recommend this book for people who like facts and are above age 8."
5,"A ""great little"" book for my students to glean from","This is a ""great, little"" book for my students to glean from, and you cannot beat the price."
1,Wasted Money - almost lost a client!!,"I used this piece of junk to rewind one of many mini DV tapes for a client I was working with and it ate the tape. I had to take the cassette apart and spend two hours trying to gain back his precious memories. Tape is so precious when it's so fragile and cherished memories can be crumpled to a stringy mess but if that's the way you like 'em - go Maxell!I too had all the problems listed in the other reviews! Before this, I bought Maxell's Hi-8 rewinder only to find out it does that same exact thing....eats tape."
3,Great when you get one that works.,"The first rewinder I bought had a loose screw floating around in it. Just an extra part? Maybe but it also tried to eat the leaders of the tapes I rewound in it. I sent it back and received a second one. The first attempt to rewind with the new one, the button wouldn't stay depressed. I had to manually hold the button down until the tape was rewound. However, after that first glitch, the second one has been performing nicely. Maybe I just had bad luck with the first lemon and the first try with the replacement. With additional luck, the replacement rewinder won't suddenly develop an appetite. (Luckily, the first rewinder did not damage the crucial part of my DV tapes so no film footage was lost.) I'd advise using a non-essential tape and testing your rewinder a couple of times before using it on your important cassettes -- just in case you have even worst luck than mine."
1,Don't get this product!,"This product is BAD. It worked OK for the first month although the rewinding speed was irregular, etc. It begins to eat tapes now. I can't use it any more because it ate my tapes three times straight."
1,"yup, this thing stinks","It rewinded the first tape ok, except the START button wouldn't stay down. I had to keep the button down with my finger.But on the second tape STOP button got stuck and somehow it eat the tape.I got it from radio shack, it's going back there tomorrow."
1,Absolutely worthless crap,"I ordered this rewinder because the idea of it made sense. Why let my camera do the grunt-work? The maxell wasn't the cheapest, but still pretty cheap, and even tho the reviews were not favorable, I tend to have good luck with stuff so I figured, why not me? And I could save $30 over the more expensive rewinders. Upon attempting to use it, I experienced exactly what some other customers experienced: the ""rewind"" button stuck down, the thing tried to eat my tape, and it never did anything remotely electrical besides niftily remove about $17 from my wallet. If you think you need one of these, send me your $17 and I'll send you a CD I don't like instead. Your chances of being pleased with your purchase is much higher."
3,"Entertaining for me, But my baby ignored it",My child did not really notice the faces on the screen; perhaps there was not enough contrast between the background and the faces.
3,Best for very little babies!,"My daughter loved this video when she was very small. She was always very drawn to other babies and this video captivated her. I agree with the other reviewers that the video does not offer much for the older infant (perhaps > 6 months). If the makers of this video ever ""update"" it, I think another music choice, or, even better, just the sounds of the babies themselves would be more welcome (at least by the mommies and daddies)."
1,This is awful!!,"I have purchased several baby videos, and this is the worst one I have ever seen. The music is just awful -- it starts out with something that sounds like the Allman Brothers -- not very baby-friendly! I had to mute it to continue. The quality of the picture is so awful that it soon didn't matter what music was playing -- it would not hold my son's attention because the picture was so bad and non-stimulating. Save your money, stay away from this video, and look into the Brainy Baby series -- those are wonderful."
1,NOT WORTH IT!!,"I bought this video today and am not one to take the time to write a reveiw, but this video was so horrible that I want to be sure that no other parent spends any money for it.The music is not child freindly, some of the babies are actually frightening!!I thought this would be like baby faces video(which I could not find) I was shocked when I saw the poor quality of this video. I think I could have made a better one!!"
1,Symantec Has Lost A Customer,"I have had all their releases going back to the 90's, but after the fiasco of trying to load the NSW 2005 Premier edition, I will no longer buy their products. Also, I am recommending to my company that uses the AV product to dump it too.This product has so many problems and bugs that a lawsuit should be brought against Symantec.I went to this product on Symantec's recommedation (yes I stayed on the phone 3 1/2 hours waiting for a human voice at their Help Desk, I even had a priority number) after their Common Client (NSW 2004)live update in December caused major problems with my PC. I thought it was a problem with my PC (DELL XPS, XPSP2, 2G) and called Dell Support Desk who told me it was NSW 2004 problem. Dell recommended that I go with McAffee instead of Norton. Dell has be hearing that there are a lot of problems with the 2004 and 2005 products.Don't buy this product, and Amazon should not offer it because it is so bad."
1,"I give it 1 star, only becuase there is no 0 star rating","I purchased this product, having using earlier versions and been completely satisfied. I presntly use Norton Systemworks 2003 and have discarded their 2005 version. Their programs are no longer integrated and each program, in multiple parts, needs to contact Symantec (parent org) with statistical info or what ever it is that your computer is revealing to them? I downloaded a trial version of 2006 Systemworks, think it's nothing more than 2005 with a few more added bugs? Norton Systemworks 2003 was the Symantec's last actual attempt at upgrading their product, save your money and invest in, much cheaper too, I may add, that version."
4,Not scared by bad reviews!,"I read all the negative reviews for this product and almost didn't upgrade from NSW 2003. But I like a challenge I guess! I have a Compaq Presario 3045 notebook Win XP SP2 60 Gig HD with 1 Gig ram. I have running NSW 2003 for two years with no problems, but my subscription was up so I purchased the 2005 edition. The install was a little slow but by following the supplied instructions there was absolutly no problems with install. I did not install the ""GO Back"" feature or ""Check It"" and I did not let the program disable the Windows firewall. Also I don't use ""System Monitor"". I have been using most every feature of the systemworks for a couple of weeks now and have not encountered any problems. I recomend the upgrade."
1,customer 99 thru 04 - Conflict and Lots of Issues+ $30/call,"I have been using Norton products till 2004.I bought Norton internet security and System works and found lots of issues.Norton ghost wasn't working , so called the tech support and they said I will be charged $30/callfrom 2004 onwards these products are just crap...Uninstallation failed.So had to do manual uninstall as per their web site!"
1,Expensive software that never worked,I got this software for about 50 dollars. I was expecting a setup similair to Norton Systemwork 2003 which was pretty good but I didn't get it. When I tried to install the software it froze up at around 10% and then stopped with an error message. Tried it again and again and even on different cd rom drives and it still didn't work. What a waste on software. Don't get 2005 systemworks and get one of the earlier versions of the software.
1,This software crashed my computer and caused software and hardware problems.,"I've been using Norton products for over 10 years with no directly identifiable problems attributed to Norton. When I installed Systemworks 2005 on my HP laptop, many of my programs stopped working! Norton deleted essential parts of software--the worst being my internet/email software. I continued to have problems with my laptop for 3 days, then, with NO warning, the system crashed. The motherboard is now being replaced by HP. I thought I'd try installing Systemworks on my heavy duty HP desktop computer. I had similar problems. I immediately deleted Systemworks and reloaded the software it had damaged."
2,I'm disappointed.,The interface is strictly Window 3.1. The technology doesn't appear to have been updated in the last few years. I'd suggest the iolo System Mechanic product instead.
3,Purchased for the Win Doctor,Price was right and shipping was good. My OS was too new for it to avoid some false positives but when searching for active X errors it has been indispensible even compared to more modern reg checkers. Overall the software is of the genre of System works that had become overly bulky and invasive but as stated it is still excellent for certain specific diagnostics and maintenance.
4,What Happened to My Rebate?,"I was supposed to get a $30 rebate on this, as a renewing customer with Norton SystemWorks, but the system never offered it to me. It seems to have been a shill that never came through -- emphasized in the promo headline, but never offered in a tangible way I could take advantage of. [...]"
1,Worst install I've ever had.,"I also bought Systemworks 2005 but directly from their site. I'v been working with computers since 1984 and this is the worst experience I've ever had. Like others the first install failed. Called the help line, could bearly hear or understand the person on the other end. Tried a second and third reinstall by the website help. Software kept telling me my trail was expired. I installed it as soon as I received it and within two days of fighting with it gave up. I can say the person who I connected with was very helpful at getting the refund processed, but I am out the S&H. I cleaned out all the 2005 registry junk and reinstalled 2003 purchased the Anti-Virus subscription and will watch for the 2006 version hoping they give up the intimidation registration scheme."
1,Worthless Program That Won't Install,"I have always recommended Symantec products - it's the only virus program I have ever used, until Norton System Works 2005. DO NOT buy this version. After a month of installing/uninstalling, following online support recommendations, & telephone support I will begin searching for another program, but I will read the reviews before purchasing and wasting my money."
2,Forget about their rebates!,"I found the product to be very helpful with using the ""SpeedDisk"" utility and the antivirus updates are also good. Is it worth buying the whole package (instead of just the antivirus software and executing XP's defragment tool)...if you get it for a cheap price, go for it. Forget about trying to get a rebate from Symantec. They make it extremely difficult to get ANY rebates! Overall, my advice is to explore other products on the market for antivirus capabilities."
1,Serious installation problems,Like many others who have posted here. SystemWorks and Norton AV 2004 and 2005 have serious installation problems. I've had problems with both versions on both Win2k and XP. I'm an experienced IT professional and worked through the support documents with no success. Buy this at your own risk. If you get it installed it will probably work well for you. But if it doesn't install the first time you'll be in for hours of frustration.
3,Symantec is slipping,"SystemWorks 2005 covers the basics of a utility package but is showing its age. It add practically nothing new to the previous versions. And, like many others, I had trouble with the installation. It took me two days to finish the install properly."
1,Doesn't even find everything,"I finally gave up on Symantec after many years (10+) of using Norton Antivirus. They need to fix their bloated and intrusive code. On top of everything, after I installed Bitdefender as a replacement, I found a couple of viruses that NAV had not flagged. Good riddance to Norton."
1,Pay to upgrade and then lose functionality and speed????,"The 2005 upgrade is pretty much garbage. You lose Password Manger, and overall PC speed goes down using the new version. Oh to have my money back again."
4,Overall great product but.........,"I purchased the Systemworks 2005 and installed it. You also have the option to install the GoBack and Check It Diagnostic tools. I installed them both. One word of warning, I have Window XP Professional and the GoBack function and Windows computer restore are the same type of function. I wasn't aware of this before but having the 2 programs running at the same time is unnecessary and unfortunatly I found out the hard way. My computer would not reboot properly because of a GoBack error and there was no way for me to get to my desktop to disable the GoBack feature. Therefore I had to take my computer in for repairs which costs me an arm and a leg. Now my GoBack function is removed and I no longer have any problems. Hope this information will help someone in the future. Symantec certainly isn't going to warn you before hand."
4,I like it!,"I purchased Systemworks 2005 with some hesitation after reading the reviews. However, I have Systemworks 2003 Professional on my Dell 8200 desktop and 2004 on my Dell 4600 desktop, both work great with never a problem. I bought 2005 for my Inspiron 8600 laptop. Installation was quite easy with no problems. I was not running a previous version of Norton. It certainly is a system hog but that is to be expected for what you are getting. I have been using it now for about a week and no problems at all."
2,Anti Virus Protection Can Stop Without Warning!!!,"The copy protection in this program can stop the anti-virus protection without warning. In my case, every 3-4 weeks I discover that the program must have the license reactivated manually. There is no warning except a red X on the icon in the system tray. Until you notice this, YOU HAVE NO ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION. Once you reactivate your license, you find that clicking on the button to activate the virus protection does nothing until you reboot your system. I do not recommend purchase on this program since you cannot depend on it to provide protection. This is a known problem and Symantec has failed to fix it."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I installed Norton SystemWorks 2005 on an XP laptop; when I tried to use WinDoctor, I get this error message: ""Some WinDoctor components have not been properly registered. This may affect one or more WinDoctor tests. If this problem persists, you will need to re-install Norton Utilities."" I've uninstalled and reinstalled WinDoctor and I get the same error message. The real insult is that once you pay $70 the their crap, there is not way to contact them to them their crap dosen't work unless you pay them $35 - in other words their customer support sucks big time."
4,Recommended for fans of hard music that want something new.,"I heard of these guys many years ago thru the metal underground, but their style a changed a little since then. If you are into groups like Sanctuary or Nevermore, then you will enjoy this too. It is heavy in parts, but the vocals are more mainstream...no high pitch wailing or low grunts. Lots of good guitar/keyboard tradeoffs for Dream Theater fans, but not nearly as progressive as DT...but a little heavier. I suspect that being their first album, their budget was limited. The sound is clear, but I would be very interested to hear them with a major-label budget, because they have lots of different moods and changes that could be made even better with some more studio polish. The lyrics are very interesting throughout, and I would like to read some interviews where they explain some of the meanings behind the songs. Favorite tracks are Cycles, Primal, and Visuals."
3,came as expected but crabs wont' touch,"came as expected and is cute as can be, but apparently is not appetising to them. have several crabs and not one of them even touches it."
2,wouldn't eat it,I had this in my crabitat for a month (you're supposed to throw it away after a couple of weeks) and my crabs didn't touch it.
3,Crabs not interested in it,The crabs don't seem to be the least interested in it. Don't know if anyone else feels it's necessary to buy
1,doesn't worth the money,"man i hate this book. I can't remember a single paragraph that strike the point. after reading it, i am as confused as before."
2,It is really just a quick reference!!,"Don't expect anything else or you will be dissapointed. I got somequick reference cards that are free for download that contain basiclythe same information!There are some code snippets and some explanitorylines of text, but nothing that helps you understand how the differentXML constructs really work - unless you already know it and just can'tremember the name, but this is what I have code-completion in my editor for.I would have hoped for some recipies that solvetypical problems that augment the pure reference style listing, but there's nothing like that.For me as an XML beginner this book is not very usefull and I doubt it is for a experienced developer."
3,A Gem - Not Flowless,"Got an used copy of this for my XML study.This book was arranged with great concentration of various key concepts in the XML realm. Very concise and quite useful for experienced program developers.However, the downside of this book is that some of its examples are not consistent with the Interface Definition, for instance, SAX 2.0, example in this book used .addAttribute Method, which could not be found in SAX 2.0 class definition at all, therefore confusion was there. The same problems were there in the DTD chapter, e.g. vague Entity explaination..For you can get an free copy of this book on the web now, I gave it 3 stars."
4,Good even as no-nonsense overview,"I was looking for a concise, no-nonsense book about the various XML technologies, including XPath, XSLT, and schemas. Although this book is billed as a reference, it was also a quick way to get up to speed on these ideas, without having to skim hundreds of pages of hype. The schema reference does not have as complete an overview as the other chapters, or I would have given 5 stars."
5,western songs,The first time i saw and heard them we're in Rio Bravo picture. Since then i liked western songs. This album lack to me the best title O bury me not on the lone prairie
4,Good hardcore/punk,"Off the Record is considered a punk band but the hardcore influence is evident throughout the album, along with a little metal mixed in. The guitars are tight (they have three guitar players)and the drums are fast and furious. If you like slick shoes or sick of change, this is probably for you. Overall, a good CD and worth the buy."
2,One of the Worst CD's I have ever bought,"All in all, they have DECENT sound at best. Their lyrics suck and their lead singer is just as bad. Some of the songs are decent (good times and remember when), but after that its all downhill. They have very little talent. If you want a decent punk CD, buy something from MXPX or Ace Troubleshooter. Maybe you'll like it, but make sure you listen to some songs before you ever buy this CD.p.s. whoever compared them to MXPX is an idiot."
5,Quit Possibly The Best Toy I've Ever Had !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this yoyo lots! It's the best buy I have ever made! I'm only a beginer, I have no clue how to yoyo, but the first time I picked it up it was only a matter of time before I got a simple yoyo down. I've never yoyoed before but now I feel like an expert!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Misleading Product Description,"Item Description claims a power output of 140 watts continuous, 150 watts for 20 minutes and 500 watts peak. Packaging on this inverter claims 85 watts contiuous, 85 watts for 10 minutes and 170 watts peak. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU REQUIRE MORE POWER !!!"
1,not working at all well...,"new 2350 ..does not print. lexmark web page does not list this model?? so can not look at FAQ and ""online support"" has not responded with a solution ..so far I have waited 27 hours for their response. Booklet shows no example of what test page should look like? nor does the website...wish I could bill them for my time ...so far a definate 2 thumbs down ..will probably return this tomorrow?"
1,Look for it in used-book stores,This is a facsimile edition of a really great classic work. This edition has blurry print and it's overpriced. I suggest watching for an original in used book stores or getting the whole thing free as a pdf at the Washington state historical site [...]
2,"Oh, please","Though the photos in this book are worth a look, the writing is the worst kind of Gender Studies drivel available. For example: ""The crossfire to which males are subjected these days - in the form of protests and questioning of gender identity and depiction of a general contemporary male perplexity and confusion - constitutes one of the most frequent and popular ploys of media communications and of fashion, which is, so to speak, the reified, objectified version of that communication transformed into tangible, salable products."" Such writing is exclusive to fields of study that have very little to offer except puffy, bombastic prose... which is, so to speak, a way of saying that this emperor has no clothes."
4,Great Holiday Album for the Apocalypse,"Great stuff here, especially the 'Jingle Bells' cover, which just needed a few whip cracks to even it out. For those not wanting to pay the 200 clams on Amazon Used, emusic.com has this offering on the cheap."
1,painful,even the most ardent fans will have a hard time listening to this painful butchering of christmas classics.
1,Disappointing,"I am an open-minded parent. A friend recommended this book. Thankfully I skimmed it before I had my son read it. Adults Only chapter? Porno? It will be too soon before my children have to face the world the way it is, and I do not want them to have to find out that Santa is not real, or what pornography is yet! They grow up too fast as it is. This book does not help. I found it very strange that a children's author would include this type of subject."
4,The wack jack,Jack on the Tracks is a funny book . If you enjoy anything funny then this is a good book to read . My favorite part is when Jack was watching the news and lightningstruck their t.v. Jacks mom was screaming her head off while smoke was coming out of their t.v. Or when his cat froze to death because it got stck in the freezer.If anyone enjoys a good laugh I would recommend this book to them .
4,A extreamly funny book!,This book was the most funniest book I have ever read! I always love Jack Gantos books I think he is the best childrens author. He has the ability to take the reader right into his books! I love him and I think you will too!
1,"Porno, striptease, suicide","Directly from the book you think is ""great.""Jack, describes himself as a ""sensitive soul.""Only to read later in the book that Jack's best friend's older brother committed suicide in the basement because he too was a ""sensitive soul."" The brother says, ""I read his diary. He said he was depressed."" Jack attempts suicide by laying at the foot of the tracks and says ""If I really wanted to die, I just had to lift up my head, and faster that a guillotine...""""Porno is for adults only."" He passes by stores with ""jiggly pink flesh"" peeking through. He buys a porno magazine and hides it under his mattress. His sister talks to him about a striptease.Jack's direct actions kill all three of his cats.As a teacher, this is not for 9/10 year olds. Or anyone, it's just bad children's writing all together.So much better lit out there for them to enjoy."
1,Jack on the tracks review,"What could have been a funny story is severly marred by the author's twisted sense of humor when it comes to the killing of animals. Three times, Jack's cats are killed, due to his lack of responsibility, and each time the author wants us to laugh it off. It's just not funny. It's too bad, because otherwise it could have been a funny book that kids would enjoy and as a Librarian, I would enjoy recommending. But, I can't keep on the library shelves a book that takes the death of pets so lightly."
2,Out of the Money,"Having been a big Eddie Money fan since his debut in 1977, I was excited to see him come out with a collection of re-makes from the 60's. On paper, I didn't think anyone could be a better choice for the great list of songs that he chose to cover. The bad news is, this CD sounds like outtakes from American Idol. His voice is detached, weak, and buried in the mix. I kept expecting the thin sound to open up, but it doesn't. To sum it up, great songs, poor execution."
5,Old sentry dog handler.,"I spent four years handling a sentry dog, (67-71.) One year in Thailand. The book was a good read, interesting and brought back a bunch of memories.Well worth the money. Good job, Carl."
1,Useless Drivel!,"As an avid writer and homeschooling parent, I was very drawn to the title of this book. I believed that it would give me wonderful ideas for projects with which I could motivate my young writers. Instead, the book tells me such things as ""Provide plenty of writing materials."" and ""Write for pleasure yourself."" This is as basic is BREATHING.... Any parent with a third grade education knows that you must have writing materials available. And, of course, a child who sees a parent writing will have more of an interest in doing so. This book DOES NOT provide ideas for motivating young writers. It tells the parents basic, ...facts that they SHOULD already know. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
5,i only bought this cos of TQ,"like i said, i bought this album for one song, by TQ... it's called 'keep on' and probably the best song on this album... i wouldn't know, i've never listened to the rest of them!!check out TQ's other albums, they never saw me coming, and the second coming, you won't be dissapointed... check out my website to him... ..."
4,He's Done It Again,"Mike Mosley's done it again!... Nothin' but heat this time with Major Work. Alotta compilations don't stand keep it tight from song to song, but this one does. The Pizzo joint ""Godzilla"" with E-40 is hot, and ""Sickness"" from the Federation is dope too. Production from Rick Rock and Mike Mosley himself is bangin. He's got AP.9 and Cognito on here. I think they Steady Mobbin artists now. This one's a keeper. Go copp it!..."
5,"A ""new"" style of Mozart","In my youth it was Ingrid Haebler, in college Geza Anda, in the 80's and 90's Murray Perahia. These were the pianists that shaped my taste in how Mozart should be played. When I first started to play this CD, I expected some departure of my norm. (ref my review of the Beethoven PC cycle)My first reaction was ""How Dare They change Mozart?"" Then I thought about all the celebraties that make a pig's breakfast out of the Star Spangled Banner and get standing ovations. OKAfter having enjoyed this CD about a dozen times I can highly recommend it. I also bought several others in this series. I have really become a big fan of Levin. I have to wonder, is Mozart up there in heaven saying, ""yes, this is what I had in mind"". He just might be."
2,Miserable trip in Italy thanks to Let's Go,"Usually I'm a big fan of Let's Go, but in this case, I have to say that their Italy guide was awful. They were misleading about the distances from stations to hostels. You'd think it wasn't far to walk but these places were often a long 2 or 3 km walk. The maps of Rome were simply inadequate and I spent so much time finding my way around Rome. Everytime I'd step into a new city, I was always disregarding Let's Go's orientations of the cities because it made no sense. Places to eat and so forth were based on which neighborhood they werre located in, and so the lack of clear neighborhood locators or lines in the maps to illustrate where neighborhoods were located really confused me. For Italy I would seriously recommend the Insight guides. Nice glossy pictures so you can see where you are and a nice, hefty indexed map of cities in the back. Don't make the same mistake I made with Let's Go Italy."
3,Buyer beware...,"Let's Go books are recognized as the definitive guides to budget/student travel, and are written and edited by students, not always with the most accuracy. The general information is usually correct, but my travelling companion and I found that a good amount of the other information (about services, schedules, phone numbers, and locations of shops, etc.) in the books tends to be out of date. When I used Let's Go Italy to find a foreign-language bookstore in Venice, for example, I found that the one listed in the guide had been closed for years. If you're really worried about your budget, you'd be better off with an International Hostelling membership and a Lonely Planet guide."
3,You get what you pay for.,"Bought this for my son's 'Party Like a Rock Star' party (for 'paparazzi'), but it had the same issue that others were complaining about- the flashes are inconsistent. For our purposes it was actually better that it had this defect (since camera flashes aren't synchronized), but I can see how that may not be desirable to most buyers. Might not be the best strobe light out there, but the price is hard to beat."
3,Bad Listing,So which one is it--a E-105 or a E-104? The title doesn't match the description. Is it a 70 watt strobe or a 25 watt strobe. The image shows an E-104.
1,Not what it seems,This is not the real light they will send it is much smaller and crappy don't buy its a lie!!
4,Disney at it's best,"These soft pleasant tunes will relax you and bring back memories of your favorite childhood movies. I used the song from Cinderella ""A Wish Is A Dream Your Heart Makes"" at my recent wedding (I walked down the isle to it) and as I looked around it brought smiles to so many faces. This tune now has special meaning for me and it will bring a smile to my face for years to come each time I hear it. It's well worth the price."
5,Great CD,My 3 year old little princess loves this cd. She listens to it for almost every nap and wants to fall to sleep with it at night too. Very pretty and relaxing music. Would highly recommend!
1,Great Book -- Not So Great Study Guide,"The book provides valuable insight into developing leadership qualities. However, the study guide seems to only confuse the issue and does a less than adequate job of helping apply the truths contained in the book. I would recommend that anyone interested in being a leader read the book, but avoid the study guide."
5,great companion to the book,"This is a companion guide to the book ""21 Irrefutable Laws"" and is designed as such. When used in conjunction with the text and the accompanying tape series, the study guide can be invaluable to developing leadership."
5,Tons of Things to Discover!,"My 1 1/2 year old son loves Elmo and lifting flaps, so I ordered this book on a whim. Much to my pleasant surprise, it's loaded with learning pictures under every flap and covers counting, the alphabet, shapes and more. He never tires of this book and will read it on his own as well!"
4,Great in the car,"I purchased this book for my son for Christmas because he loves lift-the-flap books and Elmo. I thought it would be a great combination. My son enjoys the book tremendously and it's great for rides in the car. It keeps him occupied when he gets bored with looking at the scenery or watching the movie in the entertainment system. Elmo demonstrates important concepts for toddlers and pre-schoolers alike while making learning fun.The only thing I dislike about the book (and most lift-the-flap books in general) is the potential for ripping. I haven't yet found a book of this nature that could stand up to a toddler's abuse. While I can't blame the book for its construction, I can't rate it 5 stars because of it's durability."
4,One of our daughter's favorites,"We gave this to our daughter for Christmas, when she was 18 months old. She loves it, and it has helped her learn shapes. She hasn't had any interest in the page with the alphabet yet. The flaps in the book (with the exception of just one) are holding up well with all the wear. This is a great book to take on long car rides. Lots to keep a little one interested, and all in one piece."
5,My 9 month old's favorite toy,"This book is PERFECT.My 9 month old loves to discover what's under every flap. I found that it is very durable since he is playing with it for almost 2 months every day and they are all still intact, the material is hard so it doesn't tear. It is truly wonderful, they learn numbers, letters, shappes, colors all in one. I put all his toys in a basket and he picks, so often he picks this book above any other toy, I love it."
2,Elmo's Big Lift-And-Look Book,"So many people gave good reviews to this book, but I cannot. I just received it and the flaps came off the first time I tried to open them. I noticed another recent review that indicated a similar problem. This makes me wonder if there has been a change in the manufacturing process. The pictures are very cute, but I had to spend an hour taping all the flaps. How annoying. Beware!!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"My son loves the book. It has Elmo and many other Sesame St characters, and covers opposites, ABC's, #'s and more. But it isn't very sturdy. My son has torn 3 flaps off in the 3 days we have had this book. He has many other flap books and has never torn any of them. SO far my glue and then packaging tape fixes seem to be better than the original strength of the flaps. I guess if you don't mind doing some home repair, then buy this book."
3,not so durable,My 2 year old loves this book however the first time we used it all the flaps on the alphabet page came off in our hands. We still love to read it anyhow but I was disappointed. This page counts for half of the flaps.
5,17 month old knows OCTAGON,"My son LOVES flap books. This one came to us recently from my mother. Each page offers a truly unique journey...everything from counting, to ABCs, to colors and shapes. Our 17 month old knows what an octagon is thanks to this book. He loves it! If I were to find one thing that could be improved upon: some flaps are quite small (particularly on the counting page). Colorful, recognizable Sesame Street characters. Lots of learning in this book!"
5,Get it!,"Both of my kids love(d) this book. My son (17 months) loves the activities, and when they get older, they can read the letters. Definitely ""get it""."
5,Our 15 month old's favorite book!,"Our 15 month old, who won't sit still to read any other books, will sit and flip through the pages of this book for a few minutes. There is a page with all the letters of the alphabet and we sing the alphabet on that page and he tries to sing it too... he really loves this book, there are lots of little surprises to discover behind all the flaps and it's very brightly colored"
5,Elmo's Big Lift and Look Book,"I love this book and am anxious to give it for Christmas to two grandsons who love Elmo, too. I know they will have fun discovering all the things Elmo has hiding. They especially like the lift and look books. I like the size and sturdiness. It works well for little hands that sometimes get excited and treat the books a little rough."
4,Excellent Book - Not Too Durable!,"My daughter loves this book! She's 18 months, obsessed with Elmo, and a book fiend. Of the hundreds of books she has access to, she wants to look at this book most often. It's beautifully illustrated and the images beneath the flaps are the most intricate I've seen in this type of book. Also, the basic concepts of letters, numbers, and shapes are covered. This book has it all!The only caveat I have, and the only reason I didn't give the book 5 stars, is that the flaps aren't very sturdy. During our first reading I actually tore one of the flaps off, and I was being VERY careful. Watch out when you're using the book for the first time, and don't be overzealous when trying to close the flaps - they tend to shift and tear."
3,Singers' Names,"I haven't listened to this CD, so i'm giving it a neutral rating of three. I just wanted to let you all know who the singers are. Peter Schreier, a veteran of Bach, is the Evangelist. Arleen Auger is the soprano soloist. It appears that Heidi Reiss is the alto soloist, and I'm not quite sure who or what role Armin Ude is playing. I hope this helps."
2,bach with no names,this is another recording of the st john passion of j s bach.the box gives no singers names.why?hugo saldias...
2,empty trip-hop,"DJ Cam is one of the best french DJs. But this early album of him is so flat and clumsy trip-hop(The ambient-style piano dub of this album is so unexpected and unforeseen...The other hand, hip-hop beats and scratches are too limited).....I'd rather recommend another album 'DJ Kicks!' released in !K7 label than 'Substances'.This is the worst DJ Cam CD ever bought..."
4,More character development than you'd expect,"Goblin starts pretty much like so many low budget horrors these days: Way back when, a sacrifice goes wrong, witch gets angry, curse put on town. Boom, teens with great hair die. But there's a little more story and a little more character in Goblin. It's certainly routine, but action keeps coming, the Goblin is well designed (mostly because it's under a hooded cape 80 percent of the time), and a lot of it happens in broad daylight. Imagine that! A horror movie in daylight! Anyway, i found a lot of the characters interesting, and i didn't see some of the plot twists coming, which was fun. Not one to own, but a decent rental."
5,Goblin,Goblin has blood and gore in it and dabs a little bit into witchery and spells. Not for the weak or people who have little babies (which is what this movie is about). I enjoyed the movie and have added it to my collection.
2,Not So Great,There wasn't enough on the video to keep the attention of my 20-month old granddaughter.
1,One of the Worst Programming Books Ever,"What a waste of my money! This book didn't help me learn ASP.NET hardly at all. Why? Well, I'll give you several reasons.First of all, the teaching method is brainless. The author tells you to click here and click there, but barely any reasoning is ever given for why you're doing what you're doing. In the end, you have more questions than answers.The other major problem is that the explanations that are in the book are horrible and disjointed. Concepts and terms are referenced as if the reader already knows them--even though they aren't explained until later on.And let's not forget the typos and poor English that dot this book. Was this even edited before going to press? I am so completely dissatisfied with this textbook it's not even funny. It's not valuable for anything except maybe firewood. Total thumbs down! =("
2,outdated,.NET is in version 4+ now. This book will only waste your time at this point. Was fine for college a decade ago.
1,The worst textbook in the world,I am up to the 2nd chapter of this book and it is virtually impossible to read. This English in this book is very poor. No one should have to use this book as a textbook for their subject. This book would get a grade of 0% on an exam. If you want to learn ASP.NET use a book from another publisher.
3,"Ismael y Cortijo, Una Linea","This 1976 Tico Records compilation,features Ismael Rivera as the main vocalist in five of the ten recordings. All five: Aquì Estoy Ya LLeguè, Fuerza'E Cara, Arrecotìn Arrecotàn, Calambre, and Bombòn De Canela were recorded before the 1970's, a period when Rafael Cortijo's band was known as ""Cortijo Y Su Combo"". The first two above mentioned, are from the 1966 Tico LP ""Bienvenido"" produced by Pancho Cristal. Even though they went their separate ways after 1967 when Ismael formed his own band, ""Los Cachimbos""( They got together for the last time in a 1974 concert),it is hard to imaging one without the other. Just a reminder that there are others compilations out there that teams them up in its enterity. Ismael and Cortijo, the ""Greatest Duo"" to pioneered and revolutionize popular latin music."
3,Interesting but redundant,"I found the premise of this book very interesting and looked forward to cracking it open from the moment I made the purchase. Overall I think the concept of the book is solid, but it just becomes a bit redundant after a while as many of the stories begin to sound exactly the same. The final 100+ pages were a chore to make it through because it became so overly analytical in its investigation, which is subjective in my opinion, that it read more like an overly long business meeting full of graphs and charts, ad nauseum.I would have preferred the authors have presented fewer interviews with greater detail paid to the more interesting ones. The end result is close, but misses the mark of my expectations."
4,Excellent book,"Superb book really. 1st hand accounts of what really happened and the feelings of those who suffered, those who witnessed crimes against humanity with key questions being addressed"
3,Worth the price,"'Stolen Letter' is an exquisite song, even the sample here gives an indication of how beautiful it is, a great song for driving on a rainy day. The rest of the album is fine."
2,Fifty-fifty clown,"Probably I'm growing too old, but I didn't find this release very interesting. Sneakster is a project begun by Mark Clifford (of now disbanded ambient-rock band Seefeel) and Robin Guthrie (guitarist of the Cocteau Twins). It all sounds too lovely and slick, it misses completely the power and the sovereign feel of earlier Seefeel albums or the Twins' EP ""Otherness"". Some tracks feature unlistenable, horrible female vocals. It also doesn't point Clifford into a new artistical direction. I think he has done this kind of dark ambient music much better with Seefeel's ""Succour"" or his former solo project Disjecta (""Looking for snags"", ""Clean pit and lid""). However, this CD proves that Clifford's best time is already over."
5,better than i remember,"i saw letta in the 60's at ""shelley's man hole"" jazz club. what an experience. my friend lost my album and i had not been able to replace it until now. thanks amazon"
1,Is this CD scratched?,"All I have to say is ""Don't buy it.""I fell in love with Panacea after listening to Low Profile Darkness and when this album came out I ran out and bought it immediately. When I got to my car I could barely contain myself. I ripped open the packaging, put in the cd and drove off.After driving a mile down the road I finally realized that my cd player wasn't broken, and the cd was not scratched. Every track sounded like someone threw a live mic into a tub of water and recorded the ensuing noises.I promptly turned around, returned to the music store and returned the CD.Save yourself the trouble. This CD smears the name Panacea."
1,ex-nay on the brasilia!,"i have heard a lot of Panacea's stuff at friend's house's and everything i've listened to i just fell in love with. so when i went out to buy one of the CD's for myself, i picked up this one. BIG MISTAKE! 13 out of the 20 songs are basicly silence with an occasional random distorted blast or cricket noises--literally! and then the remaining songs sorta have an implied beat.... but thats stretchin' it. i actually double checked the CD about 3 times to make sure it was the correct band because it was so bad. anyways.....unless you feel like buying something that sounds like they stuck a microphone in the middle of the forest at midnight, stay clear of this album! as for me, im gonna try to sell this one back to the music store! (the one star is for neat packaging design)"
3,4/12/06 MicroCenter = $32!,The new 802.11g version is now in stock @ $120 - this 802.11b version was marked ~$60 but it rang up $32 so it looks like a fire sale for the old version.I haven't tried the unit yet so I gave it a 3-star rating as a default.
3,"Great yodeling, bad songs","If you're looking to learn yodeling, the yodeling is fantastic. But the rest of the lyrics is less than edifying, so we hardly ever listen to it."
1,Worst Book EVER,"Basically the H sleeps with h - doesn't marry her because she dares to have sex with him before marriage (hypocrite) and then meets her cousin and marries her cause she's a virgin - while telling her he's going to marry her virginal cousin he sleeps with h one last time - she gets pregnant - five years later he comes back to her because of course all the time he loved her while married to her cousin and wants his son.. UGH!! - I want to get every copy of this book and burn it! I mean he tells her she's not good enough - marries her cousin - leaves her to bring up a child on her own, all the while she torments herself.. I mean come on - could you love this guy?"
1,oh please,"no need for a big review here. Everyone was right, it is a horrible book. The hero was NOT a hero at all. I've read other stories where the hero was a little bit of a jerk in the beginning but jeez this ""hero"" surpassed them all. They sleep together one last time, basically calls her a whore and then dumps her, and then goes on to marry her cousin. How sweet!Also, the ending was brilliant, not only did we get several paragraphs about how wonderful elizabeth was while they were married, but he also tells venetia that while making love to elizabeth he pictured her (venetia) instead. Well that makes up for everything doesn't.. What a gentleman! So by the time I finished the book, I was tired of reading about ""saint"" elizabeth. In conclusion, this book was horrible, the only reason I even read this book in the first place was out of curiosity because of the poor ratings and I didn't believe it could really be that bad....but yeah it REALLY was that bad. Yuck :["
3,other reviewers were right on!,"The other reviewers were right on but it wasn't that bad. Venetia did seem to jump into bed with Ryan pretty quick. So he thought she was pretty free with her favors. Men tend to catergorize women. Some you marry and some you don't. He put Venetia in the don't catergory. Not just because of the quickness with the sleeping with him, but also her career and how she would always put that first. The biggest problem was the whole cousin thing. Elizabeth KNEW Venetia like him. But she still hooked up with him and married him. The aunt wasn't much better. Telling Venetia to leave and then years later selling her out to Ryan."
4,Welcome,"This is basically a sampler of RCA Records ""Living Stereo"" albums, with a few comedy bits by Bob & Ray in between the music. The setup is that Bob & Ray are visiting the castle of Dr. Ahkbar, the mad scientist. While amusing, the Bob & Ray sketches are basically an excuse to show off stereo sound effects. The rest of the album features music from RCA's ""Living Stereo"" albums. Most of the music is actually quite good. It is ""adult pop music"" of the 1950s, both vocals and instrumentals. Vocals are performed by Lena Horne, Julie Andrews, Abbe Lane and the Belafonte Singers. The instrumentals are by George Melachrino, Skitch Henderson, Dick Schory, Guckenheimer Sour Kraut Band, Radio City Music Hall Organ and Sauter-Finegan Orchestra. An excellent sampler of the ""Living Stereo"" album releases. Plus, a great cover drawn by Jack Davis!"
4,Wedding bells...,"for all in this beautiful told movie. Romance,Breaking-up,and falling in love for the first time and again all over again. This is a must watch movie. Guarantee you'll enjoy."
5,twins,"I enjoy the Mowry girls, they're role models. It's a cute movie and you won't be disappointed. They're real in all they star."
3,too. . .grainy?,"Overall, I like the taste of these bars, but they're a little too mealy for my liking. I could taste the berries just fine, but the whole grains were almost overpowering the first time I bit into one of these bars.I'd much rather eat a Clif's bar, I think. They have a more subtle flavor and aren't quite as mealy."
5,So yummy!,"I love love love Odwalla bars. I am a graduate student as well as a full-time teacher as well as a vegetarian, so these are a great nutritious on the go snack for me. For the calorie value, the nutritionals are great (fiber, vitamins, protein [other bars], omega-3's). Plus, they're yummy! I love that you can see and taste whole blueberries and cranberries in this bar too. And you can't get them cheaper per bar in the grocery store."
3,Other flavors taste better,"I have tried many, many such bars, so I know that many do not taste so great. I say that to indicate that my standards for taste is pretty low. I have to say that these bars were bitter and did not taste good. I would stick with the Strawberry Pomegranite or the Choc./Peanut."
4,Bret gets the push two years two late!,"Bret Hart spent two years in a tailspin in WCW and then at mayhem he proved that he could still pull out the ""Hitman Magic""as he and Chris Benoit told a great story in the ring!"
4,Only good PPV during Russo era,"The current state of WCW really disgusts me as a long-time fan, but I'll have to say that this PPV was very solid. This PPV marked one of the few times Chris Benoit was in a high profile WCW match, and it didn't disappoint. Definitely worth a look."
2,WCW Mayhem '99,"I'm not sure how much other people watch wrestling, but this is by far the worst wrestling video i have even bought. the matches have poorly choreography and the story lines are so typical. no wonder WCW went out of business... it's because of matches like theses..."
3,WCW Mayhem '99,This was a fair to good effort from WCW. With all the turmoil in the front-office they were able to put on a classic Main-Event. Bret Hart is a WRESTLER and Chris Benoit provided a suitable opponent. Too Bad they don't try like this every month.
5,Serial Wax Killer at Large,"Don't get me wrong, Anti Theft Device was an exceptionally wild album, which got enough airtime that I started to wonder if the laser could possibly wear grooves into it. Then I pick up Eye of the Cyklops, MMM's second solo album, the day it hit the stores. I expected it to be short (due to the low price), and I won't complain about the fact that this EP is only 22 minutes long, because I'm grateful that MMM even exists. This is the coolest 22 minutes of music I have heard in a very long time, and every time I hear it the sounds get more complex and the beats get more infectious. Don't waste any more time, buy it now!"
1,Not a good deal,"Love Burt's Bees products, but this is not a good deal. There's too much stuff in the little bag that you'll have no use for. Also some of the items can't be resealed so you're left with goop. I would like Burt's Bees to make a full size facial kit with re-sealable bottles. The mudd mask (which is great stuff) a exfoliator and a moisturizer. Add that eye cream in too. Now that combination I would buy in a heart beat."
3,Too complicated way of shipping.,"I ordered 15 books. I needed it for a conference I had to give. You send it in 5 or 6 different mail boxes with more then 2 weeks of difference between one another. The last mail came after the conference, so it was complicated to reach each of the student. All the books looked nice, I just complain about the complicated shipping way."
2,boring dvd,"My two year old grandson quickly lost interest in this dvd, even though he loves trains. This looks like a home made video, not a professional movie."
4,Correcting error below...,"Matt Murphy and Chris Murphy aren't brothers. This is a common mistake. Chris was (briefly) the drummer in Matt's prior band Superfriendz while Sloan were on hiatus, and they are good friends who both grew up in Halifax, NS, but they aren't related.They act a lot alike on stage, too. But they're still not related."
4,Murphy brothers are indie rockers extrodinaire,"Matt Murphy, front man for the Flashing Lights, is also Chris Murphy from Sloan's brother. All i gotta say about these guys is they have the ultimate indie rocker look. Their parents must be an indie rock experiment or something. Strong jaw line, messy hair, goofey physique, and charming as hell. This is catchy music. Catchier than Sloan if you ask me. I wish i looked like a Murphy. I bet they get mad chicks."
4,Canada's second wave of power-pop,"Nova Scotia's Flashing Lights join a long dynasty of powerpop bands from Canada such as the magnificent Sloan,Thrush Hermit and the Superfriendz. Their trademark sound is a mixture of rock riffs and catchy songs.From the opener ""Where the Change is"" to the closer they barely put a foot wrong. Their brilliance is in being able to combine brilliant harmonies with crunching driving hard rock riffs,the most notable of these songs being ""Where do the days go ?"" with its 60's organ at the beginning and it's incessant riff throughout.They sound like a very young bunch of lads so hopefully this means that they will be around for a very long time.Popular music needs these kinds of songs !"
4,The Flashing Lights Are On!!!,"Ever stand in front of the mirror in your bedroom, tennis racket in hand and rock like no one's business? Even if you haven't, one listen to the Flashing Lights' WHERE THE CHANGE IS will make you wish you had. Just grab that racket, queue up track 2, and power strum along to ""Highschool""--you'll feel just like Pete Townshend at the Marquee Club.The Flashing Lights wear their Who/Kinks influences on their rock and roll sleeve and make no apologies--nor do they need to. Clever lyrics, thrashing guitars, fluid basslines and powerful drumming combine to form an incredibly assured collection.Man, are they cool!"
2,"Great Idea, Poor Quality","I purchased this item to give as a Christmas gift. Decided to check it out and try product before giving. One of two required batteries will not stay in, and battery cover keeps falling off. Also, light flicks off by itself not remaining on as it should. This product is a great idea, however very poor quality."
1,should have never been made,"this album is a MAJOR insult to james hetifeld,kirk hammett,lars ulrich and jason newsted. this album is such an insult to any band!the cover of ""low man's lyric"" should have NEVER been put into print!DO NOT get this get the original albums that contain actual GOOD singing!low man's lyric is the best metallica song ever and i'm insulted that james' voice had to be degraded to a gothic girl who can hardly sing!DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL REGERT IT!"
2,"Ugh, a disappointing waste of money.","Yuck. I like industrial (as well as techno), and I love Metallica, so I had high hopes for this series of albums, but I am now convinced that never the twain should meet. A few tracks were OK (hence the 2 stars), not great, while several were downright awful and unlistenable. Instead of re-creating a song in an interesting way as a good cover should, it seemed like they attempted to 'industrialize' it merely by screaming the vocals and adding more noise to the guitars, it is really just very bad, and it only made me want to listen to the original Metallica (or some other Industrial like Ministry that does not attempt to do Industrial by taking good music and ruining it with unimaginative noise and screaming...) argh. Anyway, not recommended."
1,This album is complete crap.,"I'm sorry to say, but this is possibly the worst thing i have ever heard. As a hardcore metallica fan, i think this is nothing but an insult to the band. I can't believe that they would massacre the songs like that. I believe metallica is possibly one of the greatest bands to ever have played, and they are musical geniouses in my mind. Don't get me wrong, i don't disrespect techno musicians,they're good in what they do, i just don't think that they should have anything to do with metallica songs. Now i think alot of you will not agree with my opinion and say ""but it's not supposed to sound anything like metallica"" different=yes good=no. Now korn's cover of metallica's one on mtv icon different=yes good=yes. It's too bad you can't give the product 0 stars, because that's exactly what it would be getting."
1,Hard to Believe,"I'm only 1/3 the way through this book and I have a hard time believing this story. Robert's brushes with danger read too much like a bad script to a ""007"" film, from motorcycle and car chases to his harrowing flight into Cuba with David Ferrie. In another chapter Robert is tortured by Cuban intelligence in his hotel room. This of course, only after he satisfies another one of his lovers. Many of those cast in the book are familiar characters, but Robert's interaction and dialogue with these people often comes across as quirky.This book comes across as an exercise in self-indulgence and delusion and I doubt I will finish it."
3,Interesting but Hard to Read,"Although this book is very interesting, I found it very hard to read. I got very sick very quick of the author talking about how he had an affair on his wife, how smart he was and what he did to hold all these very important government deals together.I think that if even a part of this is true however, that this is very scary. There is a lot of information about the underhandedness of the CIA and other government officials and how much of this led to JFK's death.If you can concentrate on the story and get past the self bragging, this book is very interesting and disturbing. However, for me, the constant self importance of this author got old fast."
2,You buying a magazine,"Basically you are buying a magazine, not a book. You will read it once if you are absolutely new to ASAP and then you will never return to it. If you take this book and ""SAP Planning - best practices in implementation"" (the opposite extreme with 700+ pages but very good) and combine them together and then split in half - you will get something absolutely unbeatable."
1,Very generic and no substance...,Very generic and not much for substance. Think of this book as an overview with some obvious tips... but what do you expect in 164 pages?
5,Surprisingly good,"The book started out slow, but on into it I became intrigued as the scenes went back and forth, It was a bit technical but not that hard to follow. I found it very interesting and it should be great for most people who like this sci-fi type. I would like to see part 2 --is it out there yet??I bought it because the author and I share the same last name..Wish I had written it. Loved it. Hey M. Petrangelo--where is the next part??just another Petrangelo"
4,A great Review but disappointing tests,"I'm an AP Chemistry high school student and after working hard all year, this book offered a pleasant alternative to an arduous review of hundreds of pages of notes. The material was concise and easy to understand. The only let down, however, was in the difficulty of the multiple choice questions on the practice tests. They were ridiculously easy compared to the actual AP test, and provided me with a false sense of security as I walked into the test. The free responses are very ""AP-like"" and offer a good preactice to the actual AP free response questions. Overall, though, this book is probably the best out there. (A word to the wise: Learn Kinetics (Rate Law) before you take this test!! Its a mandatory free response every year.)"
4,A good text for an intro physical oceanography class.,"Knauss provides a very readable text that includes the topics that are traditionally covered by a one semester course in introductory physical oceanography. The author includes the appropriate mathematical expressions without overburdening the reader with difficult or extensive notation. There are certainly other texts that fill that need. Knauss takes credit for what the text accomplishes, which is considerable, but also takes resposibility for the limitations of the text."
3,Gentle intro to PO,"This book is really a ""Gentle Intro to PO"". The material is well organized and coherently presented. The book, however, is really a survey of PO rather than a solid introductory text (which doesn't really exist, btw); suitable for non-quantitative or non-physics oriented reader. With this book Dr. Knauss makes PO accessible to a wider audience,... which has never been done before!"
5,Excellent book for the experienced Swing developer,"This is a very well written, specialized book meant for experienced Swing developers. In it Topley covers some of the most complex Swing topics with clarity, detail and useful examples: - Text Components and the HTML package - Bi-Directional Text - Custom Text Component Views - Table Rendering - Table Editing - Drag-and-Drop - Undo/RedoIf you are an experienced Swing developer needing to go deeper with any of the above, I would highly recommend this book. It is not for learning Swing (hence the title ""Advanced Programming""), and it is a pity that it has been reviewed as such by some others here.- Matt Robinson co-author of ""Swing"" (Manning Publications, Inc.)"
1,Should be titled: how to write an editor using swing,This book's title makes you think it covers SWING. It actually only covers a limited subset of things that can be handled using swing. If you're looking for a general purpose book stay away from this one. This might be useful if you're trying to write a text editor using swing. For the stuff it covers it might be useful but it covers very little - mostly it just collects dust on the shelf.
1,Academic Blathering,"I bought this book looking for a good Swing reference and tutorial (my previous experience with Swing has been taking the free short course on-line from SUN). I like a book to introduce concepts, and then explain them with examples in the most clear and concise manner possible. Instead, what I found in this book was a bunch of long, rambling discussions, similar to many of the lectures I received in college. If you want to learn Java Swing, this book is definitely not for you!"
2,Warning...More like a GUI design book than a swing book,"The book spends about 80% of it time discussing problems involved in GUI designs which is totally not what the title of the book states. I bought this book because I was looking for a swing reference book that covers the definitions and has small demo code blocks of the swing components. This book cheated me by its ""fancy"" name. Not recommended."
1,POORLY CONTRUCTED,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - the bulb will likely become loose as you try to screw the bulb in - be prepared to catch the bulb.
3,good if you have right pole,Have not yet had chance to use but I am somewhat disppointed that this can only be attached to the extension pole this company manufactures. Did not realize there was no mechanism to screw this tool onto a standard extension pole. I am keeping the item as I am handy and can remedy this issue. My fault for not looking closer at the picture before I ordered.
4,"Fashionable, thats about it.","Its a cute doll, looks just like the real group member. But as for keeping the attention of you child, they lack that. If you buy this you should get the tour bus as well!"
3,Only 2-channel audio,Great performance... there may be some overdubs... which is pretty normal for most live productions. Audio format is only 2-channel.
2,Lovable nerds of metal,"I'm a fan of KE when I listen to them but not when I see them perform. Too much posing, horns in the air, and cheerleading. My advice....keep listining ..just dont watch. They are good people though."
5,awesome dvd. worth every penny,if you are even the smallest fan of killswitch engage then you will love this. it has great quality footage unlike most bands dvds and really shows the band's personality
5,EXCELLENT for KsE's first dvd..,"KsE is my #1 favorite band(although they departed with old singer Jesse Leech shortly after getting into them....which is explained also in the dvd by the way)This disc has great footage and lots of it.behind the scenes a documentary and all the videos..even one I havent seen!My only gripe with the disc is this..Its widescreen which is great..BUT the sound is only in digital stereo NOT 5.1,like so many others are..oh well,I guess.Everything else is perfect though,camera angles and all.I've seen them 4 times so far live and this disc sums it all up for anyone who hasnt had the pleasure of seeing them...amazing!BUY THIS DISC!"
3,Paint it Slow!,"I have read three previous Louis Kincaid novels and have found them to be cutting edge. This one lacks that quality. After his ordeal in Michigan, Louis is asked to come to Florida by a friend to investigate the murder of an African American man. As he investigates, more murders in like fashion occur. As Louis searches for the murderer, he is joined by a rookie F.B.I. forensic psychologist. Territory disputes and the requisite tension between investigators ensue. The ending is a ho-hum conclusion to a ho-hum novel."
2,A rare clunker from Tem.,"A haunted nursing home -- not the sort of thing I'd have picked up on sight, but I loved the three other books I've read by Melanie that I was willing to try anything. As one of the blurbs states, she is unequalled in the realm of familial horror.It's a disappointment -- and a surprise -- that this novel is dull for the most part. Occasional hauntings permeate the book, but most of the story is concerned with the mundane lives of the home's inhabitants. If you're interested in that sort of thing, maybe you'll like this book more than I did. The pace doesn't change until the end, a sudden and inexplicable conclusion that doesn't satisfy on any level. THE TIDES lacks the gripping psychological drama of PRODIGAL or the imaginative reinvention of horror standards of WILDING. Let's hope her next novel is up to par."
2,I didn't get this one,"Rebecca is the new administrator at The Tides nursing home. She is in way over her head (no pun intended) as she is too young and inexperienced to run the home. Also, her father Marshall is a patient there and he is being haunted by his ex-wife, Faye, who cases massive mayhem among the patients at the home resulting in deaths, etc., etc. If Faye a ghost? A demon? A powerful manifestation of Marshall's memory? Actually, I am not completely sure. That is never really explained. Also never really explained is what the drained lake behind the nursing home has to do with Faye, or anything else for that matter. I could be suddenly stupid or something, but I am not totally sure exactly what happened in this book, even after I read it. Don't get me wrong. The book was fairly entertaining and a fast read, but afterwards I was thinking, ""huh?"" Not up to Melanie Tem's usual standards."
3,Big Disappointment,"I bought this book because of the glowing recommendations here and was sorry I did. To me it's visually cacaphonous; poorly laid out with, for the most part, junky graphics. The reproductions of art works, advertisements, etc. are of consistently low quality (and often too small to be instructive), and the modern run-of-the-mill mannequins used to model the clothing look ridiculous. If you're going to make a book on 20's fashions, use mannequins from the 20's (or repros) for heaven's sake. On top of that the photography is uninspiring. Maybe it's useful for research but this book is certainly not aesthetically pleasurable."
1,Alarmist Junk,The author is obviosly an ACLU zealot who sees every facet of America's government as something from an Orwellian nightmare. Worthless junk. Save your money and buy a comic book instead.
5,Impressive!,"I am finally impressed with Derek Trucks. This is recording exhibits the signs of someone well past his years. From the bluesy ""Baby, You're Right"" to the Indian-inspired ""Maki Madni"" to the fusion-based ""Lookout 31"", Trucks has issued the statement that he has arrived. No longer is he a Duane Allman clone, he is on his own and this CD says it all. Not only do I recommend it, I think it should be required in all collections for guitar-officianados. It's going to be a pleasure to see what he does next!"
1,Does not live up to the title track,"A Joyful Noise starts out with a track of the same name and quickly reinforces the choice of purchasing this disc. The problem is, it quickly dissolves into a cacophonous mess. There is not much in the way of ""Joy"" where this noise is concerned.I was completely disappointed. I expected so much more having heard the title track on a ""loss leader"" disc last year. Save your money."
5,Diversified!,"Trucks has a wonderful slide style. He's so smooth. This CD has a type of worldbeat quality to it. I love that stuff! The first track has such a great groove to it (you can hear that Allman Brothers influence) but then you hear Ruben Blades on Kam-mo-lay and there's a hint of Santana. However, Derek's own personal style is definitely not lost on any of the tracks. If you love slide guitar players and especially if you are a musician , you will definitely appreciate the ""Joyful Noise"" in The Derek Trucks Band!"
5,A joy to listen to,"I am a big Allman Brothers fan, and I must say, Derek has done an incredible job of ""replacing"" both Dickey and Duane.This CD is so diverse in musical styles! I just love the Qawwali song. It is so hypnotic. It is like Derek is matching Rahat Fateh Ali Khan's voice note for note. Very cool.This album is a lot like Santana's Supernatural, but without so much pop appeal, which is what I like.If you are looking for an Allman Bros./Gov't Mule album, get his first album. If you want to hear some fresh, creative music, get this album."
1,Save your money,"Let me come straight to the point. This stuff is garbage. Please save your hard earned cash, and purchase something different. This does nothing to remove or repair scratches. If you want to waste 10 dollars, you can rip up a 10 dollar bill and flush it down the toilet. If I could rate this item as zero stars, then I would."
1,Junk,"This product consists of a stand to set your DVD on and two bottles of cleaning products. The stand is too small to be of any use. The cleaning products are very messy and include very poor instructions.I was hoping for a product that I could put a disk in and have it cleaned, not a stand and two bottles of cleaning solution.In short, this is junk. Don't buy it."
3,gets rid of scratches,"I had a DVD that froze in my computer and both DVD players. After using the product on the DVD it plays without freezing.For occasional uses, this works. If more than 10 DVD/CD need to be repaired, should use another product.This is a basic manual repair/cleaning kit."
4,Gripping and Absorbing!,"Dark Edge centres around Takagi, a boy who starts at a new high school only to find that things aren't quite right there. Along with some other students, he discovers that the teachers and the school in general, is host to supernatural, zombie activity. As some students become victims, Takagi and his friends seem to be the only ones who know about, and can potentially stop what's going on.I really love this series. The plot is fast moving and interesting throughout. From the first volume onwards, there's a good mix of action and character/plot development. The characters are all well-defined, this includes Takagi and his friends as well as other, more negative characters. There's quite a few core characters, which makes it a bit confusing at first. However, as the series progresses, it's a real strength, as their various backgrounds and personalities add depth to the series.This series is totally absorbing- I definitely recommend it!"
2,Not that great at strengthing...good at breaking nails though!,"I have been looking for a more natural nail treatment that could strengthen my nails. I started to use this product when my nails started to get longer, but instead of strengthening my nails, I found they were more prone to breaking.And the way my nails would break would be in like a straight line as if they were cut. It didn't look jagged or ripped off at all, which meant I didn't have much loss of my nails or a good deal of cutting/filing in order to fix my nail.I am going to look for a better nail treatment because this one is causing me problems that I have never had before and don't want to have again. It could just be my nails, but if you do try this out, you have been warned!"
2,Not a hit,I thought this would be a easy way to get a quick dinner for the baby & for babies used to eating processed food this may work but my granddaughter will not eat more than 2-3 bites before she turns up her nose and shakes her head no. I have found it much easier to just cook her small amount of veggies and cut up cooked chicken that she can finger feed herself and she is much happier.
2,No Really....,"First of all, how can the author possibly justify reviewing his OWN book here and giving it 5 stars???? Not only is that tacky, but it reeks of financial desperation.I just got done reading ""The Bad Boys Win"" about the 86 Mets, it was much more enjoyable. It did have a few typos, but it wasn't that important because it wasn't a book that was designed for facts and figures.But, an ""Encyclopedia"" SHOULD be as accurate as humanly possible. This book wasn't.I agree with the other reviewer, the best part of this book was the pictures."
3,Appeared to have been opened,The toy packaged appeared to have been opened around the top seal and top of the package. It arrived by the expected date
2,"Good as decoration, but not poseable","Face detail: Excellent (helmet detail, helmet not removeable)Overall Body detail: ExcellentFabric clothes: No. Plastic clothes limit poseability.Accesories: Laser cannon, very detailed, it fires a projectile.Movie accuracy: ExcellentIssues: Legs are not straight so it looks weird without the cannon.Benchmarking: Not the best snowtrooper out there.PoseabilityShoulder articulation: StandardElbow articulation: NoHip articulation: StandardKnees articulation: NoFeet articulation: NoNotice I use this nomenclature for articulations.No: It has no articulation.Standard: Rotates around a single axis. Provides limited poseability.Ball: Provides the best poseability."
5,Invaluable Info for Manhattan Parents!,"As a parent and former admissions advisor, I have relied on this book for many years. The author provides key information about each school, along with all the essentials of the admissions process. Every other year, she does a thorough update of the information. If you are applying to a New York City private school, this book is a must-have. You will refer to it over and over again. Make sure you have the latest copy as you go through the process as admissions contacts at the schools change pretty frequently. I highly recommend Victoria Goldman's book. Karen Quinn, author of The Ivy Chronicles"
3,"Good book, inaccurate details","Good book to discover new hikes in the Superstitions. The mileage on most hikes I've done (including those from Peralta Trailhead) is underestimated. When discussing this with others on the trails, they have encountered the same problems.Good book if you ignore the mileage/time estimates, however."
5,Wow!,This book should come with a Kleenex warning! This story sucks you right into it so you feel what the characters feel. Really well written!
4,"Actually titled ""French Defense 3Nc4 Bb4""","CAREFUL!!! This is a good book, but its content in NOT what is described in the publisher blurb above. When mine arrived, I was shocked to find that the cover had the additional graphic of ""Bb4"" on it. ""huh?"" I thought. ""This can't be right."" Only when opening it up to the table of contents did I realize it ONLY deals with the Winawer Variation of the French Defense (3.Nc3 Bb4).While getting Psakhis' insight into the Winawer is well-worth the price of the book, if you were hoping to garner any knowledge he might have of say the Burn Variation or the Classical, you will be VERY upset to have purchased this book.Again, this is a good book, and a must-have for Winawer-players, but NOT the all-encompassing tome any book MUST be to cover all of 3.Nc3 - there is going to be yet another book released in this series that will cover all the 3.Nc3 variations OTHER than the Winawer,...you might want to wait for that one if you're not interested in 3...Bb4. :)"
5,No beautiful pictures,"This is an excellent book on animal breeding. However, contrary to a previous review, it does not have any pictures at all! It has excellent charts and tables that illustrate points in the book. I just wanted to clarify this point."
1,Book and Product are BAD!!,"If you are interested in energy healing and all of that - wonderful. I am too. After having studied at Barbara Brennan School, I was curious about tachyon crystals. When initially installed in the room - at the four corners - the feeling was almost giddy. But quickly my heart chakra closed up and I was unable to expand. The crystals created a sort of prison. I am very worried about this technology becoming prevalent. It is not hocus-pocus. It does have an affect. In some situations it may be healing. However, please note that this is not something to use if you are a seeker, or if you are spiritual in any way. This creates an energetic PRISON! You are much better off to use naturally created (grown from the earth) crystals that have not been ""infused"" with anything!!!"
2,Skip It,"I agree with the reviewer who writes that it is just an ad for 'tachyon' products. It is dense and pseudo-scientific throughout and tries to separate itself from all the excellent books about energy by proclaiming 'tachyon' energy as somehow different and fundamental to all other kinds, when at the core all energy is one and is known by many names.About the chakras and the meridians (again referencing earlier reviewer): the book Energetic Anatomy by Mark Rich shows very clearly the connections between the two - acupuncture points are like very tiny chakras. This book is a much more valuable reference if you are interested in what can be done with energy.Overall, spend your money elsewhere."
1,Save your cash ...,"Its like so often in ""real"" life - some dude has an insight and doesn't get it that he does not need to bend science and common sense in order to construct a new world-view (or, in this case almost a religion with the inventor as the savior) around it. I have used ""tachyon"" products - they work for selected issues (mostly muscle and tendon problems). Truth is, nobody knows on what principle this stuff works - but rather than being honest and admitting it a hair-raising new world-view is invented with quotes from ""real"" science to support it not only out of context but also WRONG. The latest I have heard is that Mr. Wagner, the top honcho, has now become a professor in his self-made university (no joke, check his website!). I was personaly witness of Wagner's dishonesty on more than one occasion and can only suggest to stay away from him. This book contains no valuable information whatsoever."
1,I wish I had followed the advice of other reviewers,"Avoid this book unless you crave corny and woefully outdated 'insults' and 'jokes' (which were anything but funny). Have not read other books of this genre, so I cannot make a recommendation of another title. My only recommendation is NOT to buy this book."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!! THE BOOK IS COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!,"The book is absolute, 100%, ......I can't believe I wasted my cash on this stupid book. It shouldn't be on the market. The jokes, put-downs, and insults are extremely corny and severely lame.TRUST ME! STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK AT ALL COST!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Spritually Relaxing and Fun,"Good sound. Very pleased with the arrangements of the instruments. The fiddle seems to do more of the singing of the melody. A lot of very familiar, easy to hear Gospel tunes."
5,"Tender, Funny, Authentic Voice","A wonderful, authentic voice; hard to put down.Page after page will resonate with anyone whohas ever lost someone or can't keep hold of aparent, or claim the peace and connectednessthey instinctually deserve. The writing isfresh and vibrant. Totally funny in parts, runningup against pathetic, dissappointing characters. I was engrossed in thenarrator's yearnings and laughed and smiled alongthe way."
4,A fun read,"I certainly enjoyed this ""bottom-up"" look at the revolution. I've read ""1776,"" ""His Excellency,"" and others on the Revolution (and don't get me wrong, those are good books) but this has been the most interesting book I've read on the subject, so far. Because, it follows the ordinary guys. The grunts that I've always figured I would be had I lived in that period. Just what did those guys have to go through? This book gives you a good look. I didn't give it a 5 star rating because at some points in the book, I found it to be repetitive and some of the paragraphs would jump from one subject to another with no real flow. It's knit-picky, I know, but the book could have used a better editor. Other than that, if you like the subject, you'll like this book."
3,Americas journey,"This was the first book I've read on the revolution in a long, long time.It is a heart rendering tale of the Continental Army told through some historical data and through several letters from those involved.The book was a good read but left me wanting more. Why were there so many supply problems? Why wouldn't Congress react? But it also left me with a very good taste for the ferver behind the movement. You realize the struggles went beyond Valley Forge and find yourself caught up with the soldiers who struggled with their 2 duties: one for their newly forming country and one for their families.The book is easy to read, follow and understand. I would recommend it for anyone who is starting to look at the war again. But, plan on buying more books, it leaves you with some thirst."
1,Truly awful book for discussing so many nobodies,The part about the plain soldiers of the revolutionary war being dealt with so much in detail is boring and tedious. Better to have written about the founding fathers of the US Army who were at least colonels in the army's birth.
3,"Cute, but strictly for hardcore Lemmy fans","This disc is fun if you're a Motorhead fan, and not really recommended to anyone else. Lemmy sings and plays acoustic guitar, with Stray Cat Slim Jim Phantom on drums and Danny B Harvey on assorted instruments. The disc is almost all '50s and early '60s numbers--about half Buddy Holly songs--done in a pretty relaxed fashion. Actually a bit too relaxed--it's less energetic than Motorhead or even the vintage originals. Lemmy's attempts at proper singing have some charm even though his voice isn't suited for the task and he cracks a lot of notes. The best track is the Buddy Holly ballad Learning the Game. And the CD booklet picture of Lemmy & Friends in Elvis-style gold lame is a humorous bonus."
2,A Good Idea gone Bad,"Don't get me wrong, I love 'The Stray Cats' and 'Motorhead' but this CD does not work for me. Lemmy is by no means an outstanding singer but within Motorhead, his vocal style works and could not be replaced. I expected this album to be along this line: Full-force power versions of old Rock'n'Roll classics, especially having Slim Jim being part of the project. But instead, they try to stay very close to the originals and this is where Lemmy's voice just doesn't cut it. There is no track that stands out so better save your money and buy Motorhead's 'Rock'n'Roll' album instead !"
2,Cut the crap!,"Mostly covers of Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley. I don't know what the hell is this, but absolutely not a good record. Idea is good, Lemmy's singing is good, arrangements are poor and production is very bad. Trying to be authentic? Hope not! ""True Love Ways"" and ""Heartbreak Hotel"" are the most horrible things I've ever heard!"
2,Motörhead and Stray Cats,"This is clearly more fun than good. On this side project Lemmy revisit his musical youth, singing more or less obscure rock `n' roll covers. I don't really know whom this album is for, since the average Motörhead-banger most likely won't be into this kind of rock leaning toward rockabilly. And I'd suppose that rock `n' roll lovers don't care much for Lemmy."
3,"Interesting, but not for the Woolf neophyte","I enjoyed the book, but have a fairly detailed knowledge of Woolf & her contemporaries. I think a new reader of Woolf & her work might get lost in the maze of essentially unexplained personalties & their relationship to Woolf & her circle."
1,This rating is for the non-academic,"This is almost certainly a great biography for Woolf scholars, but anyone else should keep looking. It assumes you have an encyclopedic knowledge of Woolf's life, writings, and historical context. I respect Lee's achievement, but it's actually kind of unbelievable how completely she disregards the need for any sort of explanation of anything. Why not take the time to make all this work more accessible? Where were her editors?"
5,Jacques-Yves Cousteau: an Extraordinary Man,"I think Jacques Cousteau was a wonderful man. He helped us out more than we know. This book was vey informative and interesting. I aplaude the author for having the will to write about an accomplished individual like Jacques Cousteau and doing an excellent job at it. Thank you Jacques Cousteau for doing so very much for our country and others. You have my sincerest graditude. I enjoyed learning about this topic and I liked the organization of interesting facts that I found in this particular book. I am a 13 year old Freshman attending Harvard, and I was very inmpressed with this book."
5,LOVE IT.,"If you have experienced the loss of a pregnancy or child, or know someone who has, get this book immediately. When my husband and I lost our first child (at 23 weeks) a couple years ago, we were devastated. There were three books that really helped me through it, and this was the best of those three. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND."
5,The best loss book I read after the death of my son,"I read so many books after my oldest son died, scouring libraries for the few they had and trying to decide between the myriad options on the internet, and I can honestly say that this was the most helpful one I read. It was very emotional and difficult to read at times and sometimes I had to put it down and come back to it later- sometimes after half an hour, other times after weeks, but I was so grateful to have it after my son's death and if I had been prepared and known we were going to lose him, I would have made sure I had it earlier, rather than a few weeks after he died."
5,"""You are not alone""",Deborah Davis is truly helping parents to express and understand the emotions and turmoil of losing a child. It is very comforting.
4,Wife,For my wife after the lose of our daughter. She likes the book and enjoys the reading as she connects.
4,"Empty Cradle, Broken Heart: Surviving the Death of Your Baby","This is a great book. The chapters are very easy to follow and the points to remember at the end of each chapter are great to refer back to whenever you need them. We were in a place we never thought we would be, but this book made us feel we were not alone. Our son was stillborn and it was nice to read what other people felt, because sometimes you think you are going crazy and really you are not."
4,Great Book for parents and family who hate lost infants,"I really liked this book. It helped me look at things differently. Our second son was stillborn, He was born at 35 weeks, due to a thin spot on his cord. A very rare developmental defect. I thik the best part is that this book offers advice in greiving, medical advice, and insite for other family members. I ended up giving this book to my mother. It is a book the your entire family can share!The books main thing is to tell the reader; What you are feeling is normal!!!!!!! A big thing when a tragedy like this happens"
5,Very nice Portfolio,Very good product.I do wish the pages were a little bit stronger.Very good value.
3,did their job,"The shoes didn't fit perfectly. They were both too short and too wide at the same time, and I had to add a hole to the ankle buckle. I have long, narrow feet, but I don't usually have this problem with shoes. However, they were surprisingly comfortable. I wore them all night and was standing and dancing a lot. These were some of the cheaper shoes I found and they did the job for the price I paid."
2,clear heels,I was excited to try these out for my pole fitness classes. I have to say that they are not as great as I had hoped! :( The soles came apart from the shoe base after 1 wear (I had to gorilla glue them back down). Also they stretch a lot so it causes a looser fit on the foot which was not a desirable affect. I think next time I will try the Pleaser Brand or another since these just didnt stack up to what I had hoped!
5,very comfortable and good looking,I bought these shoes for my pole dancing classes. I use them 3-4 times a week for several months already and they still look good. they are very comfortable as well.
3,Gross,"Creep is perhaps a notch above the average slasher/gore fest movie. However I don't agree with the Director's and scriptwriter's opinion that the Creep finally achieves status as a more complicated and sympathetic villain. To me, the Creep comes across as the same old killing machine - without the nuance the Director so optimisticaly imputes to him.Nevertheless, I do think fans of the horror genre will find this a worthwhile watch. The setting becomes the most interesting character in the movie. It is eerie and chilling to be projected into London's Underground after hours. The gleaming, fluorescent-lit station platforms and steep, steep escalators become all the more sinister as the viewer realizes they are leading to far murkier depths.There is another recent horror movie that does an even better job of making the setting a main character in the film though. If you want to explore a deserted setting, echoing with eerie potential - check out Session 9."
3,Not Too Creepy......,"I can't say this is a Bad movie but I've seen alot better. I just found it not scary enough. However, there are gore scenes which make up for some boring moments in this film. A woman ( Kate ), is waiting for her train late at night and falls asleep to wake up finding out that she is trapped there with the doors locked. Turns out, there is a creature living there with revenge on his mind. She finds a homeless couple living there and seeks their help in getting out of there! Some cool scenes and some suspense. But I'd suggest rent..... don't buy!!"
4,quite nerve rattling,"This DVD arrived yesterday from Amazon and I watched it last night on my living room wall up loud and in the dark. How eerie the London underground is and many scenes reminded me of the subway scenes in ""American Werewolf in London"" and some of the scenes from ""They"" and ""Jacobs Ladder""......This film is gruesome and not for the faint hearted with a few jump out of your seat moments..Soundtrack is disturbingly surreal as well."
2,A rental at best (spoiler warning),"After falling asleep and being locked in the subway station Franka Potente and others are pursued and dispatched by a deformed maniac who curiously travels with his own entorage of rats. The acting is decent but the story is full of plot holes and cliches. The ""operation"" scene was creepy but too little too late to save the film. I suggest watching the alternate beginning which was a helpful backstory of the film but was unfortunately left out. It would have filled in some of the plot holes. If you are a horror fan like me then you will probably rent it anyway out of curiosity but you are probably better off watching it when it comes to the sci fi channel."
4,Terror in the Tunnels,"This was a whole lot better then I expected. The plot was simple, Franka Potente gets stuck in the subway after closing and ends up running around the subway system being chased by some man-creature (very creepy looking guy). Surprisingly enough this movie is not as bad as the plot sounds. I have to admit, I rented it just for Franka but ended up enjoying it. Creep features a few decent shock moments, great quality, good creature makeup and what ends up to be an intriguing storyline. Well worth a rent or a cheap buy!"
2,Like The Hills Have Eyes meets Midnight Meat Train but...,"This movie starts out OK but is one of those movies that gets simply agonizing to watch because the protagonist (the otherwise likable German girl) keeps doing the same stupid move one time after another, just so what... the director can extend the suspense? I guess. But that doesn't work, it just makes you start to hate the movie. Man, when you have the opportunity to completely take out the monster/enemy, you don't just give it a little whack then half-heartedly limp along, you make sure that thing can never get up and come after you again! This movie gets a big FAIL for insulting the audience and treating both the audience and lead character with disrespect. Back to class with you."
1,THIS ITEM IS NOT A BOOK!,"This is a box set of stationery with some of the same illustrations as the Mouse Tales books--this is NOT the books themselves! The product description doesn't clearly indicate this.Very cute--but if you're looking for the books themselves, don't buy it."
5,"simly gifts, Gwozdz","gwozdz, is a fantastic musician! one of the best recording saxophonists i the field! he knows what the saxophone should be!"
4,Explains a alot!,I read his first book and had to read this one right away. A must read for someone interested in but on the fence on the emotional issue of gun control.VERY REVEALING! I recommend!
1,No basis in reality,"I'm retired after 22 years in military service and I own guns at home. I am not at all in favor of hand gun control, but this guy is just a crackpot. There is no fact he can't invent to support what he already believes.There is nothing wrong with rational regulations for guns just like we have on cars. Unless you are the Unabomber and have some mental problem that makes you scared of the government there is no reason that we can't have a few minor checks to help keep guns out of the wrong hands.I don't mind waiting a week to pick up a gun while they check my background. I leave the rest to a great American:""It's just plain common sense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those who wish to buy a handgun.""- Ronald Reagan *endorsing* the Brady handgun control bill, at a March 1991 event commemorating 10th anniversary of the assassination attempt."
1,"Lies, damn lies, and statistics","I can't believe John Lott has a doctorate and gets away with such flawed research. He ""randomnly"" called a little over 1000 people and made a conclusion for the entire nation. Can't do it with such a small sample. ... Lott uses statistics to confuse the naive and ignorant. Plus, he attempts to explain how the Taliban gained control of Afghanistan by confiscating firearms, yet never mentions the nation was and still is awash in guns. ...Lott uses ""lies, damn lies, and statistics"" to support his bias towards gun control laws and movements. Don't waste your time with this trash. ..."
4,Very educational,Lott does a great job of showing statistics and the source where he gets his numbers from. Regardless of your position on gun control you may learn some things from this book. It is well researched and a plethora of information that may cause you to think.
5,Protec Metro Clarinet Carry-All Bag Pink,"The bag is wonderful for carrying a clarinet case and all the necessary accessories. The only problem is the very thin cheap plastic loops to attach the shoulder straps. One broke the first time we used it. Luckily I had some metal ""D"" rings which I Installed, and now it is much better than new.Protec Metro Clarinet Carry-All Bag Pink"
3,does the intended Job,"This pouch should come free with the wheel locks, it is flimsy but it does it's job of keeping your wheel lock where you want it to be."
5,Wheel lock pocket,"You never really ever have a good place to store your locks and then you could lose the lock. Finally, it will be quieter because the lock isn't rolling around the trunk bare."
1,Great Idea......Terrible Product,I cannot figure out why this has a good rating. It has to be because of the idea itself because the product is just junk. It could not be made cheaper and stay together. I regret buying it and would feel the same if it cost $1.00.
3,JEEP Wrangler,"This pouch is just fine. Nothing great or unusual. It serves it's purpose, stays out of the way, and keeps everything together."
3,Should be sturdier material. Is overpriced.,"I've used McGard Wheel Locks on vehicles for over ten years, and never had a satisfactory means of storing the Wheel Lock Key. And no matter how clearly I told service personnel where the key was located - IN THE CUP HOLDER - they always tossed the trunk, glove box, center console... ruining my organization and planning ahead by putting the key IN THE CUP HOLDER.So when I saw this I thought this might be a solution. I could hang it in a highly visible, but secure location in the trunk. I was disappointed that this zippered pouch feels so flimsy. Since it will be holding a heavy metal item, and perhaps even the spare lug nuts, I had forcast that it would be some kind of sturdy heavy canvas.So for what I got, I feel ripped off. It's overpriced. It remains to be seen if the white printing will catch the eyes of service personnel when I get the wheels rotated."
2,very bad,"The truth did not seem so good, he enters the water with just washing your hands, I expected better. It leaves a very bad image for Bulova than sadness."
1,Complete Fraud,"I went to his seminar, it is flawed, inconsistent and very unbiblical. Author claims to posses previously unknown to God's creation knowledge that was revealed to him alone, describing spirits as objects that you can step on on the ground to be possessed by them. He has no following, and those who get it quickly enough never come back. He works side by side with his wife. I do not know if they know they are charlatans, perhaps they believe what they teach, but they take your money, while claiming they don't need it (about 200 bucks) for a one on one with them in the remote places that they rent at your expense, and make you sign a waiver of rights so you cannot sue them later. Think for yourself. I think they author is a coo-koo clock."
1,YUCK,NOT ORIGINALS REMIXED...THEY SEEM TO BE RE DONE SONGS THAT SOUNS NOTHING LIKE A REMIX....REALLY POOR STUFFAVOID!TOM WYNN
2,Alright,"I agree with another reviewer in that this is not the best remix. Terri's vocals tend to be somewhat ""dimmed"" and replaced with heavy bass and other electronic type noises. On many parts of the songs, the orginal sounds don't mesh well with the remix additions. However with that said, the CD does offer a sort of dance type music, but I personally prefer Sacred and Profane."
2,Re-mix ruins songs,"I love Berlin, but these particular remixes sound too ""Industrial"". It takes away from the music and lyrics instead of adding something to them. The songs are pretty much de-constructed & I feel the original versions are better. I've heard MUCH better re-mixes such as with Whitney Houstons dance songs of last year."
3,"Mostly Mediocre, With A Few Gems","I haven't listened to this entire CD yet, but I downloaded the Mission UK's remix of ""Take My Breath Away"" from iTunes last night, and it is truly amazing! It's modern, it's haunting, and a little bit trance/techno-goth, but still absolutely gorgeous. It puts Jessica Simpson's nasal bubble-gum version to shame a thousand times over.I'd recommend the CD for that song alone, unless you have iTunes and can download the song by itself."
4,Great saw for the money,High points:- Good quality construction- Great priceLow points:- The workpiece hold-down is pretty cheap and gets in the way of the motor in certain configurations.- The blade is low quality (but what mitre saw comes with a high quality blade?)Overall:Probably the best saw for under $200-$250.
3,no laser or paper,"The reconditioned saw is OK, but the laser doesn't work and I have no owner's manual or warranty card , or any kind of documentation."
2,Poor quality saw,I assembled the saw very easily. Good directions and easy to follow. The saw out of the box had a very noisy motor. I removed the brushes and found the armature with some scoring. I buffed the armature and smoothed the brushes. This did little to quiet the motor. It is still very noisy. The cut was reasonably smooth after I replaced the blade with a Freud cutoff blade. I have made about 2000 cuts so far in dry hardwood. I am not impressed with the overall quality of the saw considering that this is supposed to be a high quality saw. I won't be buying another Hitachi product if this what they think is acceptable.
3,Would not recommend buying this saw,The saw is light weight and very functional but I would not purchase another one. The reason is the table mounting holes are not aligned. This makes if difficult to mount this saw to a table stand other then the Hitachi table. When you are reviewing miter saws make sure they will mount to other manufactures tables. You should not have to make modifications to your table or buy another table just to mount the saw to the table.
1,Never got to cut anything,"Bought this to get better mobility than with my 12"" Porter Cable - heavy. Have a 10"" Black and Decker but it seems to be on indefinite loan to my son.In trying to lift the saw out of the packing box the plastic operating handle separated from the plastic motor housing assembly. Easy to see why. Four self tapping screws into four plastic posts (the screws held but the posts sheared), the screws not even penetrating into the body of the housing. The plastic: low density polyethylene, should be high density at the very least. Am going for a refund and look at other manufacturers: perhaps Porter Cable and Black and Decker."
1,What a let-down,"I've adopted a practice of crowd-sourcing my purchases by finding a general product I want on Amazon and then sorting them by highest ratings and looking for well-rated products that have lots of reviews, because statistically those are going to be really good values. This is the first time that the method failed me.This product arrived broken and from where the break was, it is clear that it is pretty cheaply made.The handle is made of plastic and held on by 4 screws into a plastic mount on the base. The way it sits in the box the handle is right at the top. It looks like pressure applied to the right spot on the top of the box would have enough leverage to snap the handle right off--which it appears is what happened. So it arrived. I opened the box. Took one look at the handle dangling from the interior wires and taped it back up to send back."
4,Solid Performer,"DIY looking for a solid miter saw at a decent price. I was very satisfied with my purchase overall. The manual was not helpful in assembling the product, but really didn't need it as most of the parts and pieces are self explanatory. Only real disappoint was with the laser guide. It is hard to see in sunlight and the adjustment for the laser line is anything but precise. If I had to do it all over again, I would have purchased the same saw with out the laser guide, saving the difference in price.Overall, a solid miter saw except for the laser guide."
4,Hitachi C10FCH2 10 Inch Miter Saw,"So far this saw has performed well. Have only had it for a few weeks with no problems to report.Had somewhat of a difficult time setting it up because the instructions that came with it are pretty bad,but the saw works well, is accurate and safe to use."
4,Prettyy Good Value,"Have had this saw a little while, waited to use it some before writing a review. I like the saw, it's much easier to use than to read the manual! You would think that after so many years building & selling products for the US, some of these guys could write a better manual. The saw is fairly accurate, OK for most uses. I had no trouble removing the blade, as some have had - maybe they missed the part about the threads being left-hand threads, easy to do since most of the manual is useless!Overall, I am very pleased with the saw & price."
3,EXPENSIVE PARTS!!!!,"I use this saw for small jobs related to home and work. The laser is cool and I have had only had 2 breakdowns so far. Previously, the fence broke off (flew off while using it; scary!!) and Hitachi replaced it. I thought their service department seemed nice enough.Recently, I tried to order parts for it (broke again). I learned that the price of 2 washers and a screw may be 1/3 of the way to buying a new saw. The woman on the phone (at Hitachi, not the distributor) said they were expensive because they ""came from China."" I found that funny. The distributor discounted it somewhat; however, I thought it would be good to put the information out there -- that this saw may not be ""worth repairing""."
3,TRY IT,"MECHANISTIC,BUT HELPFUL.IF YOU ARE DESPERATE,TRY IT.IT IS GUARANTEED NOT TO MAKE YOU WORSE,THOUGH IT MAY MAKE YOU BETTER.NOT MUCH OF A BOOK,THOUGH...BUT HELPFUL...ITS OK..."
4,Outstanding read!,"This is written so well to explore your inner self! set goals and become a better human being!Arrived on time and its what I ordered, what else do you want?"
4,Clinicians Guide to Mind over Mood,As a clinicians guide it is a bit simplistic - but good none the less.
2,"Sad, sad, sad",I was so excited to get this book and then realized it was really advertising for the book clients are to use. If you flip through this book you will see on each page the authors site their book SO MANY TIMES.... we are educated people and they can't stop citing the book we are reading. Not very helpful sadly.
3,Hmmm.... it's just ok,"As I read the other reviews I started to feel as if I had missed the point. The other reviewers were just crazy about this book and as mysteries go it was just ok, almost dull because I found it easy to predict the next moves. Maybe it's just me but I liken this book to something you read at the airport to kill time in between planes not if you are at home and have access to lots of other books."
5,If you like having your skin crawl this is the book for you.,One of the best serial killer novels I've ever read. I always imagined someone making a movie of this book and having it star Gene Hackman and Susan Sarandon. The story moves right along with not one boring moment. There is one segment that might be too much for people who can't to even read about violence being committed to children. Otherwise I recommend this book to all.
2,"I've read worse, but I've read better too.","The book: Lie to Me is one that I am quite torn on. On the one hand, it deals with subjects that I wasn't too comfortable reading, and as such, almost didn't finish it.On the upside though, it does have a surprise ending that you could easily miss figuring out through the book if you're not paying attention. (Though personally I think that the author gives way too many hints at the big secret. I had it figured out about 2/3 way through the book)Worth a read, but get it from the library."
5,Bar none--the most facinating book ever written on the mob!,"I have an extensive library of mob books and some first-hand dealings with the mob, so I think I am qualified to give my opinion that this book will leave a lasting impression on you like no other book of its kind. It dominated my thoughts and dreams during the time I was reading it. My only criticism would be that they should have developed the most interesting characters (Testa and Senter) more. They deserve their own book!"
4,Excellent book,"Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci do an excellent job of sticking to the facts. Unlike other mob books, they make no attempt to glirfy the criminals. They just tell it like it is. If you are not familiar with the authors, Jerry is the man as far as inside info on he NY mob goes. All in all a very good book. I breezed through this one. A fairly quick read."
4,Good book but is nightmarish,"This is a good book about the most viscious crew in LCN history. Killed at least 75 and perhaps a lot more. John Gotti wouldn't even take the hit on demayo because his crew had to many shooters. It centers around Anothony Gagggi, Dominick Moniglio, and the murder machine crew. Demao is so depraved that even his relatives wanted to exhume his body and dumped out into the street. Good but like the reading of serial killer novel."
5,The best true account of Mob life yet written,"This is a must read for anyone that wants to know how the mob really works and the sociopaths that it employs to run its multi billion dollar businesses. Every page of this book rings true, the Italian American family structure, the insular Brooklyn neighborhoods of Carnarsie and Bensonhurst from the 1950s through 1970s, the sociopaths that emerged from them, The Mafia cast structure and Machiavellian alliances that are formed and discarded as business needs and law enforcement activities dictate. The seedy, drug taking , uneducated hoods that populate this book are the real thing. They are not Tony Soprano, or Don Corleone, they are not even the cleaned up Joe Pesci character ""Tommy Desomme"" from ""Goodfellows"". Martin Scorsese or Francis Ford Coppola would have a very difficult time making them appear funny or romantic. They are about as funny or romantic as Ted Bundy."
1,"Murder Machine: A true Story of Murder,Madness. and the Mafi","This Book is good fiction and little else. Dominick Montiglio is the main source of information for the book. The man is a fruad,was never in the Green Berets,was not a Ranger and never in combat. Murder Machine is a good read if you like fiction. But the parts about Montiglio's combat experiences,and military references are puke making. If you read between the lines you'll see that his whole life he's been a bum and a loser. The authors should be ashamed for trying to pass this book off a a true story."
4,Appalling tale of human cruelty,"The book is well written, and unlike most books about the mob it doesn't glorify them. For once they are shown as the gutless, mean-spirited, utterly self-centred and cruel characters that they really are. But if you've got a soul,...then you'll find this book deeply upsetting and disturbing. I can't stop thinking about the children of their victims who must still be alive today and have to live with their grief every day of their lives. Don't you ever stop to think about that? This isn't just some interesting story, these horrors were inflicted on real people, many of whom are still alive today. For God's sake try and put yourself in their shoes, how would you feel if this had happened to YOUR father? All these people here calling for the 'movie' to be made have no conscience or compassion. That will only further magnify the victims pain, and they've suffered enough...Nothing justifies murdering and dismembering innocent people..."
3,Didn't flow,"This book just didn't flow smoothly for me. I did find it interesting but also got lost a few times and had to backtrack. Some readers thought it was more fiction than fact. I have no idea since I have no facts to compare to. There obviously is a mafia, crime associated with it, hit men, etc. but I have no reason to dispute the facts I read here. The murder business now seems a lot more brutal than I once thought it was. I am from Philadelphia and travel often on business to New York especially thru Brooklyn. Now I can't drive thru Brooklyn without thinking about the carnage that went on. Overall it's a good book and I would recommend reading it."
2,Not great story-telling,"Obviously, the story of the Demeo crew is a fascinating one, but I didn't feel the authors gave any insights beyond what you might get from newspaper journalism. There's no great insights on human nature or society. Read ""In Cold Blood"" by Capote or ""The Executioner's Song"" by Mailer. Even ""The Westies,"" a true-life mob book by T.J. English, is far superior to this. These are great books written as if they were fictional novels (great characterization, large themes, wonderfully crafted stories) -- ""Murder Machine"" is merely adequate journalism."
1,True only if pigs fly,"One would think that the authors of this book, being employed or having been employed by reputable newspapers, would know to check their facts. Their ""true"" story is at least partly fiction. Told through the perspective of a biased bystander with limited intelligence and perception, the ""facts"" as they pertain to at least one of the characters are almost completely fictitious. There are other factual errors that are glaring. It seems Mustain and Capeci had no problem sacrificing journalistic integrity to the gods of sensationalism and profit. The authors and publisher should be grateful that they were not sued for libel."
4,A realistic look at life in Brooklyn.,"Having grown up and lived in Canarsie, where this story takes place, it is good to see that an author has captured what life is really like in Brooklyn, NY.This story is talked about all over Brooklyn. The description of the events are very close to the facts. The authors capture the personalities of the characters with frightening realism, especially since quite a few were dead when the story was written"
1,Would love to have my money back for this one.,"Everyone has their own opinion on this book and I respect that,...I didn't find it that interesting. In fact, I thought it was downright boring. I love a good scary read, and this was not one. It was obvious that some of the reviews were by friends and family members of the author, as is typical of most books reviewed on here, but still I would love to have my money back for this one. Amazon needs to add a half star or ""no star"" to their ratings."
1,My birds won't eat it.,I cant speak for all birds but my two cocktails will not eat this food. Not sure if it is the flavor or size but they eat everything around it but not this food.
4,Absolutely off da hook!,"As usual, Willie Ninja does it again. This man should be deemed the king of house..."
2,doesn't work well,It covers the sensor that when you make a call doesn't let screen go blank. It looks nice but not very practical. The cushion stull on the inside of plate comes off on phone.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this pillow because it was supposed to be the same AWESOME pillow that Marriott hotels use. This pillow was supposed to be comfortable and the most amazing thing ever. On the contrary!!! It's terribly small, is not comfortable at all and is NOTHING like the pillows from Marriott. Add to this the fact that this $39.00 pillow cost $39.00 to ship to my deployed location. So I end up spending 70+ dollars on a pillow that's worse than the ones we get loaned here in the desert. yes, loaned, as in used by god knows how many other military members... Awesome!!! What a waste of money, I will NEVER buy anything from this company again and I will make sure all of my military friends know to NEVER use this company, especially when purchasing from Amazon...what a rip off!!! Thanks for screwing a military member over, for $70.00!Disgruntled in the desert..."
5,Great Value!!!,The bags are good quality and do the job they were ordered for.i would order more if needed.Good value for money.
5,standard money bag,standard money bag just like you would get at a bank durable and strong zipper made out of some strong material i keep alot of stuff in mine like jewelery and nothing has messed up yet
3,Its okay,"Very nice for the price but noting for its name Securit, will be better if the zipper had a lock or something."
3,Basic bag,This is a basic bag---not as nice as a actual bank bag I have but I bought it to store items so it is good for that.
4,Great Platformer,"If you liked Death Jr, you'll love Dj2. Better graphics, better story line, cool weapons and definately worth the price. Only downside is the lock-on feature for your weapons can be a little agrivating, other than that a great game."
2,"Eh, could do without this one.","Thought this would be great, liked the graphics, thought Pandora kicked butt, but not so thrilled now that I have played it. Great for teens, probably, but not me. Going to try to sell it to GameStop."
5,"great sound. found them on Pandora, then YouTube. had to own their CD's","great sound. found them on Pandora, then YouTube. had to own their CD'sLike their unplugged the best on Youtub"
5,Solid album,"The Corrs second CD TALK ON CORNERS put the Irish group further into the pop music stratosphere. It is easily their best album so far in their career. Filled with radio friendly hits like ""What Can I Do"", ""Only When I Sleep"", ""I Never Loved You Anyway"", ""So Young"" and a great cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"". This Special Edition of the cd features their singles in remixed form. Also a bonus track, a remix of Runaway which was later rereleased as a single in 1999. Other highlights include ""Don't Say You Love Me"", ""Hopelessly Addicted"", ""When He's Not Around"" and ""Love Gives, Love Takes"". Overall a great pop album!"
4,Excellent pop -,"You can't get any luckier than this unless you're the Osmonds or the Jacksons - a family with good looks, great hooks, musicianship, style and grace. It's appalling that they haven't sold a zillion records here in the US. Perhaps it's because they've been ""marketed"" as an Irish group -- yet the Irishness is only incidental. Andrea Corr has an unmistakable voice and the group writes very polished pop songs; nothing heavy, mind you, just enjoyable. They have more musical depth to them than most prefabricated pop groups and these sibling can really play. This album is their best by far...let's hope they continue."
5,Heaviest Priest Album,Album is the heaviest from Priest. Cranks out fast and heavy tracks. Still holds up twenty years later!!! Great screams!
4,4 1/2 stars. Stained Class Part II,"1990 was a time of change for Judas Priest, The simple drum techniques of Dave Holland were long gone, replaced by the much missed double Kick stylings of Scott Travis who showed reflections of Les Binks (Stained Class/Hell Bent For Leather).On Their last outing with the ""METAL GOD"" Rob Halford (Until Now!!!!!!) They decided to go back to their Stained Class roots leaving fans to rejoice. The band totally ripped on this album, they had lots of anger to get out of them do to the uncalled accusations brought upon them. Every song on this album is statement to to the cluesless that they were back, and pissed off!The reason why I gave this album 4 and 1/2 star was do to ""One Shot Of Glory"", which was a weaker part of the album."
4,Judas Priest's heaviest album!,"This is the heaviest, fastest and best album from Judas Priest. The drum intro to the title track is simply mind blowing. Tipton and K.K. Downing offer some of their best guitar work on this album. This may not be their most melodious album (check out Screaming for Vengeance), but who cares ! The best track on this album is the title track, followed by ""Leather Rebel"". In my opinion the lyrics are not that great (What is the title track supposed to be about anyway, besides the artwork on the CD ?) However, the album as a whole sounds awesome."
5,PRIEST AT ITS BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SADLY, THIS IS THE LAST AND THE BEST WORK OF JUDAS PRIEST.....BUT ALSO, THE OTHER ONE IS 2-DISC SET ""METAL WORKS"" WHICH IS A COMPILATION & IS A VERY GOOD COLLECTION OF SONGS FROM THE ALBUMS TILL PAINKILLER...I HIGHLY RECOMEND THE OTHER DVD BY THEM TITLED ""JUDAS PRIEST-ELECTRIC EVE"""
1,purely contrived & cliched,"generic songs, cheezy lyrics, stereotypical in every way. Priest initially invented the heavier aspects of metal in the late 70s early 80s...had their last truely creative and heaviest album in 1984 (defenders of the faith)...after that they took 2 years off. They saw the trends in metal change to bonjovi,poison,etc...so they copied that formula for turbo and ram it down purely to sell records. most fans didnt accept that. After that, they decided, well then lets go back to being heavier...but by the late 80s heavier was slayer, anthrax, etc. So they copied that formula as well. But once again it's so phony and generic, just to sell records. Bottom line is they sold out after 84's defenders album, and priest ceased to be priest after that."
2,DOn't know what do do...,"Priest seemed like a drunken guy that does not know where to go in the middle of a dark street...They tried to go glam and hair-metal with the awful TURBO and then they release the ""techno"" bomb, RAM IT DOWN. Then Dave Holland was fired, and came great drummer Scott Travis.So, they released the ""Ultimate"" heavy metal album. THis is not true. IN PAINKILLER, Priest reached an all-time dumbness in lyrical department,a total stupidity. Also, the album sound terribly dated today, while SAD WINGS OF DESTINY, SIN AFTER SIN, BRITISH STEEL and UNLEASHED IN THE EAST don't.PAINKILLER was a pleasant punch in the stomach at those days (1990), because it came right after the worst albums Priest has ever made (TURBO and RAM IT DOWN. But now, 12 years later, we can see how bad it is. The good point is that Tipton and Downing are soloing like bats from hell here, erally amazing."
4,The Last Good Album from Priest?,"After ""Turbo"" and ""Ram It Down"" Priest finally made a good album since ""Defenders of the Faith"" - it was this - ""Painkiller"". This is much different from other great albums and classic albums. It is much nearer speed metal than the earlier works. The first track ""Painkiller"" is very fast and catchy, a little bit too long though. Other great tracks are ""All Guns Blazing"", ""Leather Rebel"", ""Night Crawler"" and ""A Touch of Evil"". The only bad things are the short instrumental ""Battle Hymn"" and the next ""One Shot at Glory"" which is quite boring and too long. Still, I think this is an album for every Priest fan. It's not their best but it's not their worst.Stars: A Touch of Evil, Leather Rebel, Night Crawler"
5,insane metal riffs,"when this album first came out,it was probably the heavest album to date.it combines extremly fast heavy guitare,with amazing vocals.this album is heavier and faster than any maiden,mettalica,ozzy album ever released.sort of the beginning of speed metal."
4,A classic metal album is re-issued.....,"This one truly is my favorite album of theirs. A very hard melodic and agressive album that they didnt make since the""Screamin"" album and it was their last with Rob Halford. I got the remastered one and it sounds better the bonus track is probably the best on these re-masters. However mine has an error on ""Touch of evil"". Right around 1:36 the song stops for about 2 seconds as if someone paused it or edited it. so im taking that up with their Defects Dept. I wish their was albums like this in today's music"
3,hit or miss,"painkiller is a hit or miss cd. the title track is amazing and all guns blazing is awsome, ""touch of evil"" is a classic and ""one shot at glory"" is priest at their best, but unfortunatly some songs get worse with time, like the silly ""leather rebal"" and nightcrawler is a weak attempt at the early 80's era, metal meltdown also does nothing for me. I think they tried to hard to be heavy, but like i said there's some classics and some songs that sound silly over time."
3,average priest album,"Painkiller is easily priest's most overated album. The title track rules, and ""one shot at glory"" finds priest at their best. the rest of the album has it's flaws, The worst song is ""lether rebel"" and ""nightcrawler"" I think they were trying too hard to put out a heavy album."
3,A good recording.,"3.5 stars in my opinion. painkiller the song is a killer!...the rest is filled with great and stupid songs. on the great side we have ""all guns blazing"" and ""glory"" on the stupid side we have ""metal meltdown"" and the horrible ""leather rebel"" but it's still a good album."
4,Storage Shelf with Translucent Bins,"I love the colors of the bins and the fact that the shelf unit is white so it looks good in a girlie room. It's so nice to find something like this that doesn't only come in primary colors. However, there are no plugs to put in the MANY holes on the sides of the shelf unit and that makes it look a bit on the cheap side. Also, the first one I received had most of the bins broken during transport. I returned that one, was shipped another one, and I thought all the bins were fine until I had already put it together when I found that one of these bins was, indeed, broken along the edge. I didn't want to put it all back together and do another return so I kept the one I have, broken bin and all.So, while I do really like the unit and it serves it's purpose well, it does have it's pitfalls to be careful of."
2,Try a different manufacturer,My daughters and I were very excited to get this item (we ordered 2). First of all the bins aren't translucent as advertised but we were able to overlook this. Also the bins are on the smallish size...again we will overlook this. The main problem is that it didn't come with the screws!!! I now needed 48 screws to put this together. I'm not going to go out and buy that many. I called the manufacturer and they are sending my more and said that shipments had gone out without them. I should get them in 3-5 days...we'll see. What a pain! Order a different brand.
5,Durable and economical - In use for over two years now!,"I bought two of these about two years ago. They are used by lab technicians in a candle burning test lab and get used extensively every day powering Laptops on two roll-around carts. Each brun room is about 70 feet long, so a retractable cord of this length was a great find. We had no problem installing them on the wall at one end of each room, as a matter of fact, is was a very easy install. The casing isn't super heavy duty plastic, but then again we aren't smashing things into them either. They have been very durable and have met all of my expectations."
4,Great for basics and advance algebra concepts,This book has the basics and advance of algebra. It has easy to follow examples. Illutrations are very well done. Its book will be good for middle and high school students.
5,Great for Learning Algebra 2,"This book greatly enhances the algebra it teaches with many easy-to-follow examples, graphs, and pictures. Also, the topics included are very thorough. The text itself is very easy to understand, with multiple problems, including word problems, immediately following the text and examples. The back of the book has a section on using graphing calculators, a section on formulas that need to be memorized, and a section on how many formulas in math are derived. An index is also included. In addition to all this, the odd answers to almost all of the problems in the book are given in the back of the book."
1,Complex and WORDY,"I am a sophomore in AP Algebra2 and we are on the last year of using these books. They are nothing but trouble and have ridiculous scenarios. Their word problems are unusual in the fact that they use many non-useful terms e.g., t=0=1991, which in turn can confuse any person! DON'T BUY IT! unless you just want answers!"
5,Best Math Book,"I use this book at school, and my teacher is great just like the book. I've used the passport then algebra 1 and now algebra 2. It is a lot easier to learn how to do problems and the layout is really great!"
4,1 bullet 4 U,It's an alright cd if you got a system you'll be bumping to most of the jams.For the price you get a good deal it's two albums for the price of one.
4,3rd one!,"This is my 3rd one in about 25 years. I love it. Not too heavy for a paperback book. Love having AC as well as battery capabilities. Great light and placement. Use it daily and travel with it all over the world. Others just died/broke because of rough unintentional treatment. It's not fragile but if a grown man steps on it after he accdidently knocks your book out of your hands on a plane (rough turbulance), it's a goner with a broken neck! The only reason I don't give it 5 starts is the battery pack....it's big and bulky."
5,"Zelco ""itty bitty"" Original",I have had one of these for what has to be over 20 years now. Have replaced the light bulb maybe 4-5 times. Great for reading in bed so as to not disturb your partner. Would buy another if this one every breaks!
3,"Great light, BUT....","This has been my wife's all time favorite book light and I have bought her a dozen of them. The light is great and it does a wonderful job of letting her read while I sleep. BUT, she always falls asleep and the book ends up falling to the floor with the light attached. The plastic generally holds up well it's the wiring and the switch that usually ends up breaking loose. She's broken every one I've gotten her. If you can put the light up before falling asleep, then this is a great choice. If it's going to end up on the floor, you'll buy a lot of them.As for alternatives - She's definitely NOT a fan of any type of LED book light. Just the bluish tint to the light does not agree with reading."
2,A Very Frustrated Consumer,This a great booklight if it never leaves home!!! It produces a strong light but will NOT hold up to the jostling of normal travel. I have about 7 broken ones to prove it. Until this booklight is encased in a protective cover it is worthless. It also is quite heavy to carry the battery pack unit.
3,"Convenient and useful, but fragile","I received my book light as a gift, and it proved to be a remarkably useful tool. The light is bright enough to allow yo to read in a complete dark room without any eye strain. The jointed design allows the light to be adjusted to provide optimal illumination without being in the way when you turn the page. Its also nice to have both the battery pack for mobile reading and the AC adapter for reading in bed.Unfortunately, the light was dropped on the floor from a hutch headboard (a drop of less than four feet) several months after I received it and it no longer works. I assumed that the light bulb was damaged in the fall, so I replaced it, but it stil doesn't work. I must conclude that the construction of this light is much too fragile if such a small drop can fatally damage it."
1,Poor quality,"I've bought this light 6+ times. Maybe I'm insane for that, but I kept hoping the quality would improve. The number one problem is the cord failing where it joins the body. This has happened several times. Usually I could ""reposiiton"" the cord while reading, but after a while, all my attempts fail. The next most common problem is something failing where the bulb connects. The third most irritable problem is early bulb failure. I also had an AC adapter fail on me once. As with many others, I've had the neck of the light get ""floppy"" (falling unto the page of the book), requiring tightening. What I really like about it is the separation of the body from the power, keeping the part that attaches to the book really slim and light. What is so hard about designing a book light that is sturdy, light weight, and with good, focused lighting??"
4,pretty nifty,this book light is prety nifty it just slides in and on it goes love to read when its really quite and everyones asleep so comes in handy
2,i need answers asap,"hiya ppl. Im a 3rd year design technology for industry student, and i am looking to re design a book light for when I read at night. I was just wondering if anyone would share their thoughts on this subject, as I need to know if this is a goo9d problem area for me to be looking into. or email me! Safegal_uk@hotmail.com.Thx. Raq! x"
1,Needs reengineering,"I hate to admit it, but over the years I have bought 3 of these lights simply because there aren't a lot of good alternative choices out there. Each Itty Bitty light has been a problem, from failing switches to thin wiring breaking to problems with the A/C adapter plug to the hood falling off the light, not to mention the extremely short life and high expense of the bulbs. If you can find an alternative I would buy it rather than this. BEWARE!"
3,ok,"This light was good for reading at night. However, the light no longer stays in the postions you put it. I thought at first I could tighten a little screw but was wrong. My children now use it with a lot of tape to hold it in the right postion to read at night. At least they can still tolerate it!"
3,Itty Bitty Book Light,"I have been using this product for over three years. I read in bed almost every night and this light allows me to read without disturbing my husband. I've never had to change the blub. I've changed only the batteries on several occassions.However, the light is fragile. I dropped the light still attached to a book and the thin plastic book holder broke off. I now have to use a small plastic vice grip. So I am looking for a replacement. But after reading all the other reviews, maybe the new Itty Bitty's are not made as well as mine. Hmmm."
1,Poor quality,"Why does this light cost 30$? For this price and supposedly a bunch of ""design awards"", I find this light to be of extremely poor quality. The connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension. The chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on. I am still looking for a better alternative, but for the price, this light isn't worth the investment."
4,Walk the Talk,"Corporations often speak of the importance of behaving with integrity. Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the recent headlines of unethical activities that have taken place in corporate America, they don't always walk the talk. Ethics at Work is a very timely book and meets a critical need in corporate America. Not only does this book do an excellent job of stimulating thought around the topic of ethics, it prompts careful consideration of one's own personal behavior and offers practical guidelines for ensuring ethical motives and actions. If there were an excuse before, thanks to Lattal and Clark, there is certainly no excuse now for not demanding consistent ethical behavior in corporate America. They have scientifically demonstrated how to walk the talk!"
5,Wonderful book!!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It has such lovely poetry and I simply love it. I read it over and over again. I encourage everyone out there to buy this book. It really is wonderful!
5,Snack table,Thanks for the table. It is the perfect item for small spaces!!It was easy to assemble and is strong.
4,Very handy! Good quality!,We don't have end tables in the living room so it always sucks when we want to sit down and have a glass of wine in the living room (our ottoman is a big leather thing). This works awesome! It's great quality and perfect for a few glasses of wine or coffee.
5,I want one,"This was exactly what I expected. Solid and sturdy. Looks great. (I think it is better than the photo.) This is the second one I bought as a gift. Now I want one for myself! This was the best price, shipping is still pricey, but the table isn't flimsy so the weight does cost."
3,Functional but definitely NOT elegant furniture,"A functional product but don't be mislead by $109 list price as it is of a low-end department store quality. Shipment arrived with a half-inch splinter on the edge of the table and missing two cross-members which were promptly replaced, though the replacement table had a half-inch dent about the same place as the splinter on the first."
1,Don't order this !,"This table is not level, metal pieces don't connect evenly, and the top has bumps all over it because the top coat wasn't applied right.It is worth $20 maybe, certainly not the $60 they are charging."
4,Very Good Quality for The Price,"I admit that the table frame bolts together in a somewhat awkward manner, but once together it is very nice. With a little fussing you can get it to lock together with good stability, and the bolts have held tight for over two years now. The solid wood top is excellent. Sure, it would be great if the metal frame was one piece, but then I would likely be paying over twice as much as this item costs. $65 to purchase AND ship? This is a very good buy. It's a tremendously handy design; I'm buying another for a different room."
4,So They Say,"This is the second CD I have bought from Pete Francis, former Dispatch bassist, the other one being ""Untold"".The two are different, no doubt about it. This one seems far more mellow, definitely for that more relaxaed period. Untold seems to be more upbeat, with quicker music, and has good flow to it.Personally, I prefer this one myself. It is more personal and you can definitely relate to it on a completely other level.A few of the standout tracks are: ""Father Rose"", ""I Don't Wanna Fight"", ""Carry You"" (old Dispatch hit), and ""So They Say"". Not a bad song on the record, though.Take a listen for yourself!"
5,SRV Fan ? Pls continue,"Live concerts seem to catch the beat of the moment and this record is no exception. You like guitar blues like Stevie Ray, you'll like this album for sure. I've enjoyed it now for, almost, the past ten years and never seem to loose interest.This album comes highly recommended - just listen and be convinced."
1,Come on already!,Enough of these money hungry pigs! Enough of this season 4 vol.1 Or season 1 vol.2 crap! Give us the complete series in one package already. And make it so us common folk can afford to buy this series that we love! PLEASE!!!
5,Voyage to Adventure!,"This DVD set brought back memories of watching reruns of ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" on Saturday afternoons. The picture and sound quality are incredible! This was the season when the series had the ""monster of the week."" Season 3, Volume 2 is definitely full of imagination!"
5,WHERE IS SEASON 4 TO COMPLETE COLLECTION?,ALL OF IRWIN ALLEN TV SERIES FROM THE 1960'S ARE GREAT AND THIS IS NO EXCEPTION.I HOPE YOUR CORRECT THAT SEASON 4 IS COMMING OUT SOON BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TERRIBLE IF THEY LEFT OUT THAE LAST SEASON. EVERYBODY'S COLLECTION WOULD BE INCOMPLETE. FOX HAS RELEASED ALL OF IRWIN ALLENS TV SHOWS (THANK GOD) BUT THEY JUST NEED TO FINISH IT WITH SEASON 4 OF VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA. COME ON FOX COMPLETE THE COLLECTION!
3,EXCELLENT IMITATIONS N WITH DRUMS BUT QUINTESENTIAL SONGS R MISSING!,SNEEZY SHOULD HAVE DONE AT LEAST ONE MORE SONG: THERES A TEAR IN MY BEER. Quintesential Hank sr SONG! I had no idea what sneezy was thinking of with his crew?! Shame on em!
3,"Very berry, but very greasy","Okay, I admit it, I'm a red licorice junkie. But I don't care for Red Vines or Twizzlers; they just don't have the ""tooth"" I desire in a good whip. These spirals are very tasty (almost too good) and they offer a good, long chew. The one drawback is that they tend to be very oily thus the reason for my 3-star rating. Still the berry flavor is spot on. Just what I love about strawberry licorice. Warning: Having a 5 pound bag of licorice in the house will weaken even the mightiest willpower. You've had your caution."
2,Hariubo Gummi,"Bought this candy to try it as a fill in snack. Not a fan of gummi stuff. So, that was my mistake. But, the strawberry flavor is ok. The bag is gigantic. So it's good if you have a lot of kids to eat them. They advertise a five pound bag, they're not kidding."
1,Poor Flavor and Lack Sweetness,"After reading other reviews, I was looking forward to trying the Haribo strawberry gummi candy. I was very disappointed with this candy. Although these candies are shaped like strawberries, their flavor and scent do not resemble strawberries at all. In addition, the gummi candies lack sweetness. After sampling several of the strawberries, I am going to throw away the remainder of the bag. Disgusting!Try the Haribo gummi peaches. Those candies are wonderful."
1,Poor Quality and Taste,"I have purchased these gummi candies in the past and not had a problem, but these strawberries tasted terrible and I ended throwing them out."
2,WARNING!!! Do not order these in the Summer!!!,"Be cautioned, do not order these in the summer. No protection was taken to protect these from the summer heat, so I received a 5 lb bag of gummy goo! The entire bag was liquid when I received it."
4,Pretty Good,"Funny thing about this order: I thought these were a different kind of strawberry gummy that I like from a different company (and which I have yet to find to buy in bulk). So I ordered these gummies by mistake thinking they were the strawberries I was looking for and it turned out they weren't. However, I was not disappointed that much since I do like Haribo gummies in general and these strawberries are tasty nonetheless. I've nearly finished the entire 5lb bag from my order on Jan. 4th, but I don't plan to order these particular strawberries again. Not because I didn't like them, but because there is another strawberry gummy that I like more over these (sorry, Haribo!). But don't let my preference dissuade you from purchasing these. The price is right and the 5lbs will last you a while and they are of great quality."
5,"Yummy, Yummy, Yummy, I love me some Gummies...",I still haven't eaten all of these. It takes a while to go through five pounds of gummies :)
2,Not very fresh,I'm a fan of Haribo products but they were not fresh and some were not the usual flavor of strawberry
4,Simplicity at it's best,We wanted a simple camera that took great pictures and we got it. With everything automatic there are not a lot of ways to mess up a picture. It is a true point and shoot and downloading is touching a button. No hassles!We have taken some(I think)great pictures and have printed them out 8x10 with fine results. We have an early Christmas party this weekend and we can't wait to get the grandchildren and the rest of the family with no more 6 month wait to use the film and get it developed.
2,Shutter Problems...,This camera worked great for about 6 months. Humidity caused it to goof up and restart itself a lot (setting time and date back) until it finally has stopped working all together. Real easy to use and all but what a pain if you live in humid weather. :(
1,stop working,"I bought it on May 3 2011, today April 30 just 1 year, it stops working. So bad.Should pay attentions."
2,Delightful Lady - Disappointing book,"I give book reviews, and since Betty White is ""all the rage"" right now, I thought this would be a good book to read and give the review before a particular ladies' group. But alas! The writing is terrible, the book boring, and I wish I'd never ordered it. Needless to say, I will not be presenting a review on this book."
2,Way too basic,"Since there is little in the way of material to research the business of boarding kennel management, I was looking forward to watching this video. Unfortunately, it was simply a bunch of brief interviews with kennel owners, that appeared to be filmed straight out of the 80's. Way too basic for anyone seriously considering the business, and priced too high for the lack of pertininet information it provided."
5,Big Fan of Laird Cregar,"This is a great product for the price. Laird Cregar did very few films before his death in 1944, two of which are in this selection. Hangover Square was his last film and featured him at his best. Extreme talent. The other movie ""The Lodger"" was also in this selection and once again his talent is featured. Great movies, great star."
2,Beware the still photos/ad art galleries!!!,"Although in most ways these are classy DVD presentations, I did encounter an exasperating technical problem when I got to the still photo/ad art galleries. You're instructed to use the right skip/left skip buttons on your remote to move forward or backward through the images, but when I repeatedly pressed those buttons a slashed red O flashed on screen, indicating that I was requesting an impossible function! On a hunch, I tried the same thing with the special features disc of Fox's ""Fly Collection""; same result! (I should add that I e-mailed Fox Home Entertainment about all this, but - predictably - they didn't bother to respond.) If anyone out there has found a way around this problem, let me know!"
1,Blah. Predictable and Boring.,"Based on a review somewhere, I bought the collection for Halloween. The Lodger was the show I really wanted to watch. Oh please. Maybe in 1944 that was scary stuff. Nowadays...hmmm. No. Nada. Yawn."
4,thoroughly entertaining,"I remember these Fox films from years ago and was delighted that they were finially out on DVD. This is good, solid entertainment with the best of actors. - you will not be disappointed. Perfect for a Friday nite at home, especially if its raining with lightening and thunder - know what I mean? Plan to purchase Vol. 2 when it comes out."
4,Could Be Worse,"I must admit that I did like this single, and that ""Glitter"" (the soundtrack) was o.k. I really don't understand all the negative criticism. I guess her high vocals are just wearing thin. As a whole ""Loverboy"" is a naughty treat for the R'n'B lovers and Mariah lovers. Not for everyone, but not bad."
2,This Is When I Stopped Being a Fan,"When I first heard this song, I was absolutely appalled at the childish lyrics, the tissue-thin vocals, and the blatant sampling of another song. Then I heard the deejay say ""Mariah Carey"", and I was taken aback. I've always regarded Miss Mimi as a very gifted singer/songwriter, so to know she was respinsible for this pathetic song was shocking. Then I bought the ""Glitter"" album, and the whole album was just as bad.Mariah- what happened to your singing and songwriting abilities? You used to be so incredibly talented, now you're just another run-of-the-mill Ciara or Rihanna."
1,"This Is Worse Than ""Ice Ice Baby""! 0 Stars!","Listening to this song made my want to comitt suicide. I'd rather be dead than listen to this song. ""Glitter"" is not worth purchasing (movie and album). This has got to be the worst song ever. If this was Mariah's first single off of her first album, she wouldn't even be classified as a one-hit wonder. Now I'm a huge Mariah fan, but it goes without saying that this song is scary. I don't know what's scarier, watching ""Glitter"" or listening to the album."
5,The future is...white?,"A fun collection of songs as Larry attempts to bring the future into the world of show hosting. And in Larry's eyes the future is random, automated, and, er, white.Each singing veggie is based off a song that was on an earlier audio CD but because we are dealing with Larry it gets different. However the songs are a good mix of silly, funny, and inspirational.To the best of my knowledge the only song off this episode to appear in another DVD is the Erie Canal song which shows up in Veg-O-Rama.The sound and video quality is very good and I don't think you can get this on VHS. You won't be disappointed you bought this one though."
5,great service,The seller was quick to respond to my emails and offered a refund due to length of time in receiving the book. I will do business again with seller. Book was in exact condition as stated.
1,I must agree with Gabby,"I looked up Whiskey Creek and they are a self publishing company like Publish America who published her other books. She needed to PAY someone to publish them..they are that bad!! The grammar was unbelievable, sentences were mismashed, writing did not make sense..gibberish. She jumps from topic to topic..very hard to follow. I got a headache just trying to read it. Terrible. Awful. Horrible. I can not suggest this book all I can do is warn you about it, save your money..unless you need to start the woodstove!!"
3,Check the band size before ordering.,"Unfortunately, I had to return this watch. The band was supposedly standard, but would not fit my wifes wrist. Links to expand the band were not available and therefore it was not acceptable to my wife. I have returned the watch and it has been delivered but as yet (only a couple of days) I have not heard from Watchsavings. It would have been nice to know the band size before ordering and also to know that links for the band were not available."
5,Bulova Watch,The diamonds and gold make this watch unbelievably beautiful. The tonneau shape is unusual as well.Bulova is a brand I have trusted for years. I love this watch. It can be dressed up or down.
1,Are you serious? 7 Bucks?,"OK...are you really serious gitalongs? 7 bucks for 1 box? Even if they are theatre size as your ad states you have to be out of your minds to list them for 7 bucks.....guess what, they are at the dollar store in ther exact same size for, yep, a buck."
1,could use more info,"I thought this might be informative but if you read the description of the article, you get all the information that is in the document! There are many things that would make this better. For instance, discussing the status of an organization that is a nonprofit and which has applied for tax exempt status. Most people don't know it can take years after forming a 501(c)3 to actually be tax exempt.I was disappointed because I was looking for some good ways of describing our organization (one of the in betweens) and in learning something more about the process of moving from one to the other and what's needed in this gap. It would also be helpful to include information on the other terms that are used and what they mean, such as what is a 501(c)3 and organizations that describe themselves as not-for-profit..."
3,bobaaaaaaaa,they are brown but when u start cooking them they turn black... not what I expected but at the end of the day I was happy with the product
4,Just a Fan,This is just a great CD. Pheyland writes from the heart and sings from the heart. He is a talented musician and it shows on this CD. The style of songs vary and they all touch your life in some way. Knowing Pheyland personally just makes all the songs mean so much more. Listening to this CD you can learn alot about yourself too.
4,Very good but a couple scenes of animal violence,"We received this video as a hand-me-down. My 2 year old loves it but there are scenes of lions eating baboons (you get to see bloody tissue!) and a pack of wild dogs tearing apart some other animal. I am ordering some Zaboomafoo videos to replace this video. The chimp video is going to be conveniently lost for a few years. It is a very good video, but maybe for the elementary school age child."
4,Handy Book Light,"This book light is great for reading in bed without disturbing another person. I use it with the converter so I can plug it into the wall , but the battery adapter works well for travel. I have also used it to read in the car. I wish the wiring was a little heavier, as this was where my former light failed, but it lasted for several years with regular use."
3,OK but delicate - Doesn't Hold Up to Frequent Use,"While these book lights work well while they are working, they just don't hold up to frequent use. They seem to develop short circuits often and the hinge loosens up too much so the light flops over. Also, the bulbs burn out pretty quickly. I've had 7 or 8 Itty Bitty booklights / both original and volume 2 and have had to replace each of them within a year or less with normal (nightly) use. Keep looking there are better ones out there. I recommend the Phorm. It's a whole lot sturdier."
2,Itty Bitty lasts itty bitty time,I have had both the original and the volume 2 book light. Both lights developed shorts in the wiring that cause the light to flicker --- very annoying. The light will not stay upright and flops down to the page. Have the same problem with both lights. I am looking for a new book light without an arm to flop or wires to bend.
2,"Great light, poor reliability","This is a wonderful light. The light quality is good. It is lightweight and clips easily to books and magazines. However, mine broke after 2 years of infrequent use. Loose wiring connections make the light flicker and I can't fix it. Also, the arm keeps falling down, which is pretty annoying, and I can't fix that either. It seems to be designed to be thrown away after moderate use."
2,"Hardly ""Sleek"" and Relatively Fragile","I've used Itty Bitty Book Lights for so many years I can't tell you when I bought my first one. So last year when I needed a new one, I thought I'd try this newer model.Not a good decision.This one does not lay flat all all when folded. The telescoping arm does not have the range of movement that the arm on the original version has, which I found annoying. As time went on, it became harder for it to remain all the way out, so that sometimes the light would unexpectedly turn off in the middle of my reading.The light met its end, however at the hands of my two-year-old grandson, who without any effort pulled the extending arm completely out of the base. I don't know if that says more about him, me, or the light. He should have been asleep by then, and I should have been watching him more closely.But the light should have certainly been made more sturdily. ;-)"
2,loose hinge marrs the light,"The light would have been ok if the hinge did not flop over all the time. It does and that's too bad. The hinge is overly loose, meaning that you can not use the light placing it on top of the book. The only way I have been able to use it is to have it under a book. On a positive note, the lightbulb has lasted me a while."
5,"Zelco ""itty bitty"" Book Light, Volume 2","I found this Book Light to be much better than its kin. It does not glare as much and the rotating hat does an excellent job of shining the light on both pages from one side of the book or the other. However, I was disappointed by the bulb itself, since the burn life is rather short. It may behoove one to try to find a longer lasting bulb if one exists. Also be sure to grab an AC Adapter since if you are like me and do a lot of reading at night, you will want to get one of those. I found the one that is recommended by Zelco to be especially suited for the job. So grab that one since the few dollars they want for it is well worth the cash outlay."
1,My impression,"Dear Customer Service,I am please about the refund; I am please about all thinks that I purchase from you.The web page where I bought: Zelco ""itty bitty"" Book Light, Volume 2 I believe is not clear.By looking the page I had the impression that I was going to buy a mini lamp where I was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a LED lamp.At list this was my impression.Sincerely,Adriano"
1,Itty Bitty Is Pretty _ _ itty,"I purchased this light and loved it...until it shorted out. I was using it one night and the light kept flickering off and on. each time I slid it open or shut. So I purchased a new bulb, thinking it was the bulb. I still had the same problem. I returned it to the company. Instead of sending me a new one, they ""fixed"" (NOT) the shorted one that I had returned. Still have the same problem. So I purchased a clunky, old fashioned clip-on light at Target for $5.00 and love it. Who needs ""itty bitty"" anyway......unless you're very, very little......very tiny maybe you might need an itty bitty one....yeah, that's true. But I'm not a very little itty bitty tiny person, so the clip-on works for me. Thanks."
2,De-evolution,"This item did not work when I got it. I returned it to Zelco, who informed me that it was my error, they did not do refunds, and returned it to me.I had a previous model Zelco that worked great for 10-15 years. It had a switch. This new one does not have a switch and at this time will not turn off.Gr."
1,Built in failure device with each Itty Bitty book light,"The wiring of every Itty Bitty Book light includes a series component just underneath (and enclosed by) the bulb socket. Apparently when the light heats up too much, this component 'blows' like a fuse making the book light useless and requiring the owner to buy another. This could occur on the first, the tenth or the hundredth use.THIS PRODUCT IS A RIP OFF... DO NOT PURCHASE!"
3,Both Good and Bad,"A good reading light with fresh bulb and batteries. However:* Bulb life is erratic; one hour to one month...* Battery life could be better.* The fat base on the light frequently causes book to tip andfall off my nightstand when I put it down in the dark, oftenwaking my bedmate."
1,Not Itty Bitty,"This item is anything but itty bitty. The actual light part appears sleak enough and will attach to your book etc., but there is a sencond part...the battery compartment, which requires four, count 'em, four ""C"" batteries. It apparently is supposed to sit on your lap or something. Very cumbersome."
1,Don't buy this product,"Light is beautiful and functional, and so great for traveling, but first LED light failed almost immediately and second after about 2 months. Too bad."
5,itty bitty Book Light,"The ""itty biitty"" book light is light, easy to use and provides a bright, direct light that doesn't seem to disturb those around me."
1,Disasppointed,"The first time I ordered this product it never arrived at my house. I reordered, but the product was defective. I have used one of these night lights for years and have been very disappointed not to be able to replace my broken one."
2,Not Enough Light,"I used this product on a train one night when everyone was told to put out their lights (I was traveling through the former Yugoslavian Republic during war time) and it didn't really work, I could barely make out the naked pictures of women in the magazine. The light does not give enough luminescence to read without getting your eyes tired and the stand keeps falling over."
1,had potential,Size and brightness were great. But poorly made. I've had 2 with adaptors. Both times the plug into the AC adaptors just stopped working. I mentioned it to my neighbor. Exact same thing happened to her. My comments relate to using the available AC adaptor for the product.
4,Nice little gadget.,"It works fine, throwing an adequate amount of light for reading without too much glare. It is easy to use, being fairly well-balanced and not too heavy. It runs off 4 C cell batteries. I suggest getting an AC adapter to avoid the battery recycling."
4,GOOD PRODUCT!,"Not a GREAT product! My children have been playing around with it, and it seems to have durability. It did note come with an instructional booklet to find notes or to play simple songs. That would've been nice. It sounds like any other recorder, and that's what I paid for."
3,Great selection of Piaf favorites,"This an excellent collection of Piaf's best soungs, but the quality of the recordings was lacking. Some of the songs have a such a vibration to the tone that it muddles the sound. But I don't regret the purchase, just wish it was better in quality. I was under the impression that it had been remastered."
2,expiration date is in Aug 2012!,"I got the 12 pack of this , but cant not believe the expiration date is Aug this year, it s Mar 15 already. hw can i finish all 12 packs before August"
2,"Thick, Greasy Product in a Tricky Pump","I normally am thrilled by Juice Beauty products, but the Green Apple Moisturizer with SPF 15 disappoints. It is thick and greasy and is not smooth when going on my skin (it is cakey and thick and really needs to be rubbed in). With the consistency of regular sunscreen, it would be difficult to love, but unfortunately it is also hard to get out of the pump. It comes out in little spurts or not at all which makes this a frustrating part of my beauty routine. I will not be purchasing this again. Even though it is packed with great ingredients, it falls far short of my expectations."
2,friction stickers,this yoyo sucks if you dont have friction stickers. i bought this yoyo from toys r us and the first day it was awesome but after 2 days the friction stickers wore down and the yoyo would not come up even if i binded.So i only recommend this to people who have tons of friction stickers.That point aside it was a great yoyo until you had to replace.
4,Good of kind,"For fans of the industrial style. Best if you have your own supply of hardware parts (Hurrah for grandpa and his fifty-years-of-clutter workshop). This could get expensive if you have to buy new. More and better ideas than the similarHome from the Hardware Store: Transform Everyday Materials into Fabulous Home Furnishings.I especially liked the Pipe Island. It should be scalable for many spaces. But for most stuff, I'll check the local thrift stores and Ikea for similar clean-lined items before trying hardware style."
4,Good purchase,"If you love Asian horror, you might love this. Suicide Club is pretty slow, but still worth the watch. Moon Child & 2LDK were our favorites. 2LDK makes the purchase worth it, full of humor, irony, & roommate hostility."
4,two out of three,"From bad to good...Moon Child was lame, I would compare it to Vampires:Los Muertes with Bon Jovi...that bad. Suicide Club was definately interesting and a good movie at least for one viewing. 2LDK was awesome...I will be watching this movie again. It made the purchase worth while."
5,MoonChild worth waiting for,"Since I watched Moonchild on youtube, I wanted to own the dvd. After a long time of searching I found this collection and to my surprise at a very good price.If you are a fan of Japanese action/horror/comedy don't waste time and buy these excellent movies!"
1,Sold improper format for USA usage.,"Now have to go through time, trouble and expense to return the DVD. Wrong format sold for usage in the USA."
4,"Good quality, format not so much","I like Hugh Grant so of course I start out on a positive note. The quality of the video and audio is excellent although I have not yet watched every movie on this disc.I gave it four stars and actually considered only awarding three because I really do not care for 4 videos on one disc. While it is easy enough to select one from the four choices, getting back to selecting another one was at least for me a no go. Very annoying indeed. And given that I have another four set package (Steve McQueen) which came on four different discs, I cannot but help consider that this is a major fault and perhaps deserving of another docked star. But I was gentle."
3,Basic operant conditioning,"This book was a little simple for me, since I have and experimental psychology background. However, I did discuss it with a few friends with dogs, and found that they had no idea that they were actually reinforcing bad behaviors in their dogs. There are very good suggestions for gradually encouraging wanted behaviors and discouraging the unwanted behaviors. I highly recommend this to anyone who has not previously trained a dog. It is also a good checkup for experienced dog people, like me, to make sure we remember all the mistakes we could make."
3,A text book for dog trainers,"This is one of many books I have purchased in search of a solution to an aggression problem between my two dogs. How Dogs Learn reads very much like a text book or technical manual. If I worked with dogs in a professional capacity, I think this would be a very useful book, as it would help me learn the jargon. In my case, trying to learn a new vocabulary got in the way of learning the concepts behind them. I had to read some sections several times, but I did learn some interesting things about dog training. I feel I have a better understanding of my dogs, but I still have no idea how to keep them from fighting."
3,Needs a little spice!,"Though I found the information in this book to be of interest (I was excited when I came across the book), the authors could not have written a more boring book on the subject. I'm about halfway through right now and it in no way is begging me to finish.The two authors (both PhDs) should take a bit of their own advice. Unless we are re-inforced with humour or lively writing, we will cease reading.Dry, dry, dry.L."
5,great,"it's like having an extra closet in my bathroom, towels, bathrobe and clothes are all right at hand getting out of the shower"
4,Handy and good value,"With a wide door, this was a good find. Good value, sufficiently adjustable, looks good and functions well."
2,Over the door Hook in Black,I'm not very happy with it because I wasn't aware that it was for a thick door and my door is not as thick so I had to adjust it but it doesn't look the way it's supposed to look. I feel that the seller should have stated that it was for a thick door.
2,scattered to the max,"I purchased this at a used cd store, and listened to it last night. I suspect it will be going back. I know Jason Moran is a great pianist, but I'm starting to wonder about these projects where he's really all over the map. Maybe I just don't get it, but as a jazz drummer, I like to think that I'm minimally hip to stuff. The group Bandwagon, plays on maybe one third of the cd; wish they played more; kudos to the drummer. Martin Sewell, the guitarist, did a lot more with Cassandra Wilson. Sorry, I'm not going on with endless essays about genius this, genius that, blah, blah, blah. ECM references; forget it (check out Tomasz Stanko new recording, Lontano). Guess I just didn't like it."
2,How do you control this thing!?,"This game is VERY hard to control and the camera angle is bad. Trying to climb,attack,jump or even walk in a strait line gets tricky. The story line is hard to follow (and its boring) and has nothng to do with any of the 2 lilo & Stitch movies. I played to the 3rd level and quited. The only good thing in this game is how you can unlock scenes from the first L&S movie.(it be easier to just rent the movie though!) To all those Lilo & Stitch fans, dont buy this game maybe rent it but not buy it. I recomend Lilo and Stitch 2: Hamsterviel Havoc for the GBA. It might not be that long but its enjoying and has easy controls."
1,frustrating and dull,"My son was very excited to play this, and after about 15 minutes declared it a loss. (Loss of my money, that is, as his interest was spent.) This isn't like him - generally he'll play a new game a lot longer, and usually beats a game without giving up. He said that it was hard to control, and boring to boot (and he LOVES Stitch). I wish I'd taken heed of the prvious review."
2,Save Your Money,"This book was more than ""based on"" the Wired article, it was the Wired article. I read both the article and the book, and in my opinion there was very little added to the book. I would suggest buying the Wired Magazine that had this article, ... .Excluding that, the book was well written and entertaining, but somewhat disappointing. The amount of access the author had provided great visibility into the trial, but I felt the author squandered that information. There was very little analysis, and often the author missed humorous/interesting snippets that other books/articles had picked up (e.g. in ""The New New Thing"" and Upside's news coverage of the trial).This book felt more like a synapse or a chronology, and it left me wanting more..."
3,many music sheets listed; little editorial or hobby advice,"I was disappointed, but maybe that is my fault. Many music sheets were listed, with values. But there was virtually no editorial matter about the hobby in general -- nothing on price trends, determinents of value, reproductions, collecting, storing, arranging, buying and selling, etc. Very little 19th century or high-priced stuff. Mostly a book of lists, which would be useful for many collectors."
4,Useful to find price point to start valuation,"This is a great starting guide for collecting sheet music. There are suggestions for collecting and keeping music safely. There is a very large index of music and prices. I will be using this book to get a price point for music I am interested in selling for a long time to come. I will also not hesitate to use this shipper. Service was fast, courteous, and the book came in the condition it was listed in."
5,Great field guide for the Rockies,This book has helped me a great deal. The species accounts are very informative. The photography is beautiful. I think this would be great for both new and experienced birds who live in or plan on visited the Rockies.
3,Not what I expected,"I was looking for sea chanties (shanties) for my husband. This is all instrumental and more Irish/Celtic in spirit. I like the music and will continue to enjoy it (more than I personally would have like the sea chanties), but it was not what I expected."
5,Perfect pirate playing,"If you want piratey music that isn't a children's sing-along album, this is perfect! Good music. Sound effects and ""story"" just set the mood."
3,too long,The best thing about this movie is the earthquake scene. Wonder how they filmed it. A woman`s movie (too long and sentimental). Margurite going into a convent is a little hard to swallow. I would have prefered a different ending. I had never seen it and was anxious to but was disappointed. I was expecting a grittier story.
4,A Marvelous Melodrama,"If you've got 2 and a half hours, a cup of tea, and an appreciation of costume melodrama, this is the flick for you. Starring Lana Turner and Donna Reed as loving sisters whose lives and loves take a very different turn, Green Dolphin Street carries the viewer through tragedy, disaster, and utlimately, the realization that it is not we who are in charge of our lives, but a greater Love. The special effects still hold up, the costumes are great, and the performances by Turner, Reed, Van Heflin, and Richard Hart are first rate."
5,A beautifull done film!,"This is a must see film, for any fan of a good story or the classic movie era. Donna Reed and Lana Turner both shine in it as the sisters in the film. It's a very entertaining and meaninful story, of women and men who love a person they can't have, but end up loving who they can have so much more and deeper then their first love. It truly deserves all the stars it can get."
2,Good for Inexperienced US Managers,"I've worked and lived in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia. This book might be useful for U.S. managers with no experience in the international arena. It has a very strong Western cultural bias; some recommendations in the book would be disfunctional in non-Western cultures; a somewhat naive approach to cross-cultural management."
3,Not so great,"The diamonds were a little yellowish, they were a little cloudy, and they didn't sparkle like I would have wished. But what do you expect for $300?"
2,"Cheap, but full of black specks.","I thought these stones were fine until I compared them with the equivalently rated stones at several local jewlers. These diamonds were loaded with black specs, like 15-20. The diamonds at my local jewlers' stores contained only two or three black specs visible under a microscope and barely visible with the naked eye. I returned these and bought some from Kay's. They were about 25% more, but the difference was huge. Much more sparkle."
3,chances are,This is the 3rd review I'm giving. I'll keep it simple. With these earrings you are spared on the packaging as they arrive in a poor box and poor bag. Get past this and the diamonds appear fine without any bad marks and with a good sparkle. Without really knowing what I'm looking at I think they are nice and look very good on my lady. In hindsight I probably should have gotten a bigger stone or more expensive setting. The back of the earrings get loose and may fall off.
3,Diamond Earrings,I bought 2 pair of 1/2 carat diamond earrings in the middle of December and they are very nice. Then I bought 2 pair of 1/2 carat diamond earrings in the end of December and they are very POOR quality. Very cloudy and I'm not impressed.....
2,Standard dustpan with very tiny broom,"I gave this product 2 stars because the broom is about 3 feet high. Why they couldn't include a standard broom is beyond me. Another problem I had was that within a year of use, the elastic on the edge of the dustpan began to tear.There are better dustpan/broom alternatives available.I wouldn't recommend the product."
5,Can use on hard floors,"The rubber edge helps the dustpan to lie absolutely flat to the floor, so you can actually sweep the dirt off your floor. THANK GOD.The dustpan doesn't really lock into the flipped-up position, but for the price, and the fact that it actually works, I can get over it. It's not a huge flaw.It comes with a teeny little convenience broom that does a fine job of sweeping effectively, and is just super-teeny and makes you feel like a giant while you sweep. No big deal.Overall, I recommend this dustpan!"
1,Unexpected broom size,I had this item before with a proper size broom. What I got was a short handle on a too small broom. So now I have to go out and replace the broom withanacceptable size and quality Quickie broom like I had before. Extremely disappointed product as it is.
3,The broom is too small,"I understand the design of the broom/dustpan is such that the broom will snap into the dustpan. But that seems more gimmicky than anything else, because it creates more inconvenience than it saves. The broom is too small; its suitable only for sweeping a pile of dirt into the dustpan. You have to buy another separate broom for the actual sweeping part."
4,Flip lock dustpan,I like it and it does a good job of not leaving a line of dust on the floor. It's bigger than I expected. Sometimes it's a little awkward getting it to open without having to touch the pan.
4,decent,"it is a dustpan that folds up so its not going to be very study but thats something you get used to. other than that, i would recommend this product."
2,Poor fit,"This was the least expensive version of this part, but if your application doesn't require the heat shield, discard it. On our customer's 1995 Wrangler, the shield bottomed on the engine block before the flange met the cylinder head, causing the intake manifold to warp when we torqued the bolts. We had to tear it all back off, 'modify' the shield and machine the intake manifold face to correct the huge air leak that resulted. What a headache!"
1,BEWARE CAMETA ON THIS SALE!!!!!!!,"Beware Cameta on this sale of Lenmar batts for $12. I recently ordered via eBay, thru Cameta this same deal, and the batteries WERE NOT Lenmar.The were APC."
1,Do NOT buy for Nikon D300,"Title says it all. It will probably not work on the D300. I bought one and the camera does not recognize it, they then graciously sent me a second battery and that too didn't work but they did refund my money. It may work on other Nikon models but be very wary about buying 3rd party batteries for the D300. I bought a second authentic Nikon battery later on which works perfectly."
3,Smells like burnt coconut,"I bought this coconut oil because I thought it would not have a strong coconut smell, since it wasn't extra virgin. It smells like burnt coconut instead of fresh, and my boyfriend can't stand the aroma of it when I use it for body oil. It is a good value and moisturizes hair and body very well, so I will still give it 3 stars,but the smell makes it something that won't work for me. If you don't mind the scent, then you will love this oil."
2,Couldn't get it out of the bottle!,"I was excited to start using coconut oil in cooking because I had heard so much about the health benefits. However, when this tall blue bottle arrived, I could not actually get the SOLID coconut oil out of the bottle! Anyone have suggestions?"
1,Price too good to be true...,"If the price looks too good, it probably is!! How in the world are you supposed to get the coconut oil out of this plastic jug?? Right now it's a solid jug of useless coconut oil. I guess I'll try warming it up slightly in lukewarm water, and then store it in glass containers, but don't hold out very high hopes that I can do this without having a ton of plastic tainted oil."
4,very good oil,"i use this oil for cooking, hair care as well as as an all over body moisturizer when the air/weather is extremely dry. it is lightweight and smells wonderful"
3,Sat on shelf too long?,"I have used this product before and loved it; thus I decided to buy it in a larger bottle.After opening this, I'm rather disappointed. It has grit in it. :/ Not sure What the grit is. Doesn't look like sugar. It's solid white.If anyone has any advice on how to correct this, please advise as its very annoying when rubbing on skin."
4,Great stuff - when in liquid form,"Like everyone else, the product is great. Love it for my hair, skin, etc. (don't use it for cooking). HOWEVER, getting it out of the bottle is another story. I softened it by sitting the bottle in hot water then poured about half of it in another container that I can just dip my fingers into. Sometimes, you have to scrape a handfull out and let your own body heat melt it so you can apply it. Other than that, very pleased."
3,"Great price, not so great taste","I use coconut oil on a daily basis for everything from frying to making my own mayo. I purchased this oil because it seemed like a great price, and it is inexpensive. However, it has a strange flavor. I was expecting a strong coconut flavor, which is fine, but in reality it's a strong chemical/coconut flavor that overpowers other flavors unless the dish is highly spiced. I've tried this oil in at least 10 different recipes with the same results. There's a weird taste that can't be overlooked. I'm disappointed but I won't be purchasing this again."
2,Caonairphone Digital - used,"The product came on time, however it was packages poorly as the item was moved around during shipment with no packaging material. Given that is was a used item resold, no instruction manual was with it. Also no phone cord one included, as I had to buy that. To this day, I still can't change the date and time plus the volume is still so loud even when set to the lowest. Eventually, I will buy a better one; I took a chance on this one because of the price. Not really pleased with this order."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"I first read this piece of rubbish at a local library several years ago. It was purported to be the ""real diary"" of the notorious pirate Jean Laffite. But, several experts in handwriting and historical documents pronounced it a fake. (I too had examined the ""real diary"" first hand.) Back many years ago, John Laflin was passing himself off as a direct descendant of the ""Terror of the Gulf"" but it turns out he was a notorious forger. He forged this item and a handful of photographs as well. He managed to make a nice sum selling this trash. What's even more amusing is how Price Daniel Sr. the former governor and a collector of Texana was duped into buying this hoax. Now my dear reader, I just hope YOU won't be duped into buying this nonsense."
5,"All good, no complaints!","I recieved the book in good shape, it was used, just like the add said, but in very good shape. I'm happy!"
5,A Ghost Writer's Perspective,"This story is about an eleven-year-old girl named Allie Nichols. She is an average six grader with one special quality. Allie has the ability to see supernatural beings. Ghostly spirits appear to Allie for help so they can eventually rest in peace. She meets the spirit of a handsome young man named John Walker. Allie believes he genuinely needs her help, but she soon realizes that some ghosts are not honest. Although the intended audience for this book is 14 or older, younger children who like suspense and mystery will also enjoy reading this book. If you listen to the audio book, you will be intrigued by the narrator's mastery to bring the characters to life. It will capture your attention and imagination!"
4,Fire,"The Ghost And Mrs. Hobbs is about a girl named Allie who is solving a ghost mystery with her best friend Dub. While Allie is trying to solve this mystery strange things start to happen to her. Dub leaves Allie because he doesn't like the ghost's attitude, so Allie is all by herself trying solving her ghost mystery.I really liked this book by Cynthia DeFelice. I have read 2 of her books. I can really relate to the charaters in this book, like how Allie was upset that Dub left her. This is a great book. Read it!"
4,The Mysterious Ghost and Mrs.Hobbs,"A ghost came to Allie for help. He wanted revenge. He wanted to get back at the person who killed him. He goes to Allie and tells her things. She goes looking for more information about what happened to him. He was killed in a fire. While Allie was looking for things in the library, things started to melt. She goes and interviews Mrs. Hobbs, the lunch lady. While she is interviewing her, the papers on the table catch on fire. John Walker (the ghost) told her that Mrs. Hobbs killed him. Later in the book, she finds out more unbelievable things about John Walker.I like to read mystery books. I think they are the most interesting things to read. One thing I liked about this book is the clues were the most interesting. If you like mystery book, you would like to read this one.There is another book like this one. It is called The Ghost of Fossil Glen."
3,Earnest,"The essence of early-80s electronic futurism distilled into forty minutes, this sounds quite silly nowadays - po-faced, deadly earnest, tuneless and generally monotonous, with lyrics about urban decay and lines such as 'he's a tangent, she's an angle'. 'Plaza', 'No-One Driving', 'Underpass', 'Tidal Wave' and 'Touch and Go' grow on you, but Foxx's two-note vocal range and punkish aversion to melody dates the album unfairly. Played fifty per cent faster on bassy speakers, it's quite good as dance music. It's fascinating if you're into analogue synths, though, as it sounds like a more uncompromising version of the Human League's pre-fame albums, all screeching strings and thwupping percussion. It's also apparent that Gary Numan stole most of his vocal inflections from Foxx, although his masterstroke was to add hummable tunes. Foxx followed this up with 'The Garden', a more conventionally poppy record, and a swift slide into ambient music, computer game soundtracks and obscurity."
2,Way too big,"Before I ordered, I read the existing two reviews saying that these bulbs are big, but I didn't pay enough attention. These bulbs are HUGE -- twice as large by volume as the incandescent candle-shaped bulbs I hoped to replace. They look ridiculous in the old-style ceiling fixtures we have throughout our house. No matter how cheap they are, they are not cheap enough to get me to use them as I had hoped. I guess I'll put them into closets where no one can see them, in which case I have ended up paying 4x as much as what I would have for spiral-shaped florescent bulbs that could have done the job."
3,ElectroCFL Candle Shape CFL45 Energy Saving Light (Uses 13W = 45W Output) -- 6 Pack,"These are not small. they are longer than 4"" long. they fit the regular size socket not the small socket chandelier which i thought it would have fit and the light is dim. I was not pleased."
2,AN IRRITATING NECESSITY,"If you're doing AV scripting (TV, particularly), this is a must. It's MUCH easier than struggling with Word columns or templates, and it delivers a very professional looking product.But there are too many missing or problem features. First, it has an irritating tendency in Windows XP to shut down due to errors. So save...early and often. Then, there doesn't seem to be a zoom function for Windows (there is for Mac), so you're stuck with a full page at a time, which isn't great if your eyes aren't as strong as they used to be. And when it comes to sharing...if the person receiving your script doesn't have Final Draft AV, you'll have to export as a .pdf or a rich text file.In other words, for as long as this product has been around, Final Draft hasn't attended to some basic issues. Make it exportable to .doc format for Word, make it zoomable, and above all, figure out what the code issue is that's shutting it down and it will be a MUCH better program."
1,The slowest program I've ever seen.,"I bought this to work on a long form documentary. I have about 70 pages and it takes 5 minutes to just open up. It is extremeley slow to use. Very frustrating. This is true when I use it with my IBook 600 mz or with my dual core 2g. This program is worth nothing unless you only use if for one or two pages, which I guess would not take up too much memory. Don't know cause I haven't tried. Good Luck"
4,Only One Like It,"I have been struggling with Word with Tables to create two column scripts for over 10 years!! Thank heaven that the guys at Final Draft have made a program that keeps the columns lined up!!! Really, it is a pain, with everything out there to make a script that will only be a few minutes - it takes over 3 hours of sweat to get it right. The program doesn't do a lot, but what it does do it does with precision and ease. If you write AV two column scripts, GET THIS PROGRAM. It is worth it!!"
4,When Time Ran Out,"This was a very good book about a jewish boy and his family in Germany during the rising of the Nazi's and Hitler. It shows what some of the regular people were doing and how they felt, not to mention how people's views and feelings change."
5,Big Louie's Review,"My Grandchildren loved this skeleton !!! They played it over and over again. Any loud noise sets it off and even my 2 year old granddaughter could do it. If I had to do it all over again, I would purchase it again."
3,delta blues/cajun two step,"The previous reviews are for a different video. This video has a cajun quartet, a fife and drum band, Son house, Skip James, and Bukka White only. All of the performances are good, with son house the standout."
4,Great DVD but needs play all button.,I LOVE Super Why! My daughter LOVES Super Why! The only reason I didn't give it five stars because the DVD doesn't have play all button so you have to hit play for each & every episodes. I will buy any Super Why! DVD out there since it has help my daughter so much with knowing her letters.
5,Great Buy!,My son is almost 3 and he LOVES Super WHY! This show is so great for preschool kids who enjoy interactive story lines. It's helpful with letters and reading and the characters are a modern day fairy tale and they retell the stories we grew up with! Great Buy. We have a number of the Super WHY products including the other dvd.
2,"not support subtitle(english, french, spanish)and serve many ad","my son, he is 5 years old, really love to watch super why on TVbut it is not easy to watch on TV on time.so i decided to buy super why series.but these not support any subtitle . for example english, spanish, or french.you know that, super why is not easy to young children.my mistakes, i bought many little einsteins DVD at Amazon.com.little einsteins support subtitles , english, spanish, or french.personally, i recommand little einsteins DVD. it is easier to young children.Super Why!: Jack and the Beanstalk"
4,Godo product,Pretty good product. Just as remember them. Wish they were a tad softer and they would have gotten 5 stars.
1,Had a Waxy Chemical Flavor,"I've been eating Haribo Gummi for years and especially love the Tiwn Cherry gummi. Imagine my delight when I bought two bags of Haribo gummi candies, the Twin Strawberries and Twin Cherries. However, when I got these bags of candies, there was an overwhelming smell of wax and chemicals that just turned my stomach. Not only did my hands stink of this horrible chemical smell, but the candy didn't taste very good. As a result of this horrible cloying chemical smell, I ended up throwing 3/4 of these bags away. The large sized bags also did not have the same flavor or texture as the smaller bags of Haribo. I wouldn't recommend this product to my worse enemy."
1,CHEAP Candies.,"If I could give it -5 stars I would. It doesn't taste like cherry at all. It tastes like a normal gummy bear candies you bought at the store, but these taste worst, they taste like they are loaded with SUGAR.Do not buy and think these are not sweet, they are so sweet with artificial sugars and colors.VERY BAD!"
4,Distinct Cherry Flavor -a little tough,"3.75 stars to be exact.If I had my druthers each piece of Twin Cherry Candy would be a little sweeter (but without a sugar coating), a little softer (it's not too tough to chew as is though), and a little smaller. -But this product is still a nice change from super-sweet candy."
4,WAIT!,Okay this is a really nice product. It's cheaper than going to the store and getting the same amount. BUT WAIT! Keep looking and you can find the same item here on amazon with free super saver shipping on orders of over $25.I was kinda bummed because I only discovered this fact AFTER I had paid for my order. And this cost 12 dollars to ship.So save yourself 12 dollars and get it with free shipping.
3,Togummi even for a gummi candy,"I love Haribo products. I think they are amazing and I have them on recurring delivery with amazon.com for quite some time. On this one however, they dropped the bomb. It is to gummi and does not have enough flavor."
3,Bland,"It could be that they simply aren't my type of gummi candy but I was not to fond of these. They were a little rubbery and the cherry flavor was very weak. I could tell the flavor, but if I hadn't known (and they weren't shaped like cherries) it may have taken me a few tries. I ended up throwing a fair portion of these away, not because they were gross or anything, but they just weren't good enough to warrant the calorie cost."
5,A wonderful treat,"I have always loved Gummis, or thought I did. Now that I know what a REAL gummi treat should taste like, not to mention the texture and freshness I will never go back to any other brand.I love Haribo treats, ALL of them. In fact I have to ration them out otherwise my family can go through a 5lb bag in about 2 days.The $15 is a huge savings and they store fine in any ziploc or tupperware."
5,Yet Another Gem from Andy,This CD has it all--from smooth sounding arrangements to complex harmonies and timing. Andy and John play well together and have produced a recording that all steel-string afficionados should have.
3,Solid '60's thriller (...and don't mess with the baboons!),"I saw this movie back in the day (when it was new) at the drive-in. All I could remember was the final image of a man and a baboon locked in a bloody death struggle... so when it hit blu-ray, I had to check it out.Solid thriller. Great cast (oh, Susannah...York! Dee-lish!), interesting predicament where survival is not so much against the elements as against each other. A few cheesy effects in the animal and hairpiece department. All in all, recommended.Note: this is another film collaboration between actor/producer Stanley Baker and writer/director Cy Endfield, who had previously worked together on the classic war/adventure ZULU. While this flick isn't on Zulu's level, it's still a solid drama/thriller well worth watching."
4,Entertaining Action Film,"Sands of the Kalahari is one of the more entertaining action/survival films of the 1960s. A cast of mainly British actors, along with American actor Stuart Whitman, give strong performances as survivors of a plane crash in the south African Kalahari desert. Director Cy Enfield, who also adapted the screenplay, proves himself to be a fine action director as he also did in two other 1960s films, Zulu and Mysterious Island. Olive Films has presented a very nice remastered widescreen transfer with vivid colors and really sharp picture quality! Though there are no dvd extras(or subtitles), the transfer quality more than makes this dvd worth the purchase. All in all a very nice surprise for those of us who remember this film from late night TV!"
4,I've Waited for this One,"I watched this in the ready room aboard the USS Shangri La CVA38 back when it was first released. I saw it once more back in the 80's on broadcast tv and recorded it on VHS. That tape was loaned out and never returned. I've been waiting for this DVD release and now have it. The story is as spellbinding as the first time I saw it.I also have the book and have read and reread it many times.I am disapponted that there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired. My wife, and thousands of other people, depend on subtitles to fully enjoy the videos."
2,ball stand,"I ordered it several weeks ago and am still waiting for it to ship. By the time I get it, it will have been over a month since I ordered it."
2,Not the greatest collection,"There are much better compilations in my opinion than what is on thisCD, why did I buy it then? I purchased it for my boyfriend, but the songs are just too familiar to spark any real emotions other than a sing along. We hardly play it at all. Just my opinion."
4,It's a pretty good collection...,"Although individually the songs can stand on their own, I think the compilation could have been put together better. There are a couple of songs, you really don't want to listen to if you're in the middle of a serious ""Quiet Storm"" love power play! For instance, the Jackson 5's ""I'll Be There"" and Bill Withers' ""Lean On Me"", doesn't give off the same scent and vibe as ""Cause I Love You"" by Lenny Williams and ""Float On"" by the Floaters! Compilations should be smooth and even..like hot melted butter! But as I said, broken down song by song, it ain't bad."
4,Pure Slow Jams,This is an excellent CD of Old School Jams. I have really enjoyed listening to the selections on this CD.
1,Buy from somewhere else,"This may look like a good deal compared to some of the other listings on here for Ford door panel clips, but this one only comes with 3 compared to 25 for the others."
1,Still going down..,"As one reviewer said, this is ""the album that time forgot"". And forgot it just because it's bad. Because it does not sound lick Priest. Because it's unfocused, commercial, and they were still licking their wounds from the TURBO fiasco!RAM IT DOWN is really, really obnoxious."
1,THE WORST PRIEST ALBUM...(WITH ROB HALFORD),"JEEZ! WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? One thing I can say about Judas Priest is that if you read their linear notes they are either always patting themselves on the back or under the delusion that they are infallable. RAM IT DOWN starts off promising with the title track...not a bad tune. HEAVY METAL starts off with a cool guitar intro...then everything goes downhill. The lyrics are so silly (and not just this song) you'd think after this many years and albums they could maybe write something other that something with ""metal"", ""rock"", or visions of fire and brimstone. Lyrically, they've been as deep as a bucket of water. Songs like HARD AS IRON, MONSTERS OF ROCK, and LOVE YOU TO DEATH are not only goofy, they're lacking one very important element: melody!Sell outs? Nah! They just happened to put out a rotten album. Thank God they redeemed themselves with their next album 4 years later...PAINKILLER.I still can't believe they can be proud of an album so bad."
1,SMASH IT DOWN,"Time forgot this album simply because it is obnoxiously bad. Priest flerted with an electronic drum sound, weird pacing, they were totally lost here. Prove of this: after this drummer Dave Holland left, they hired drummer Scott Travis and released the extreme heavy and aggressive PAINKILLER, by many considered one of their masterpieces (altough I think it contains the worst lyrics ever by Priest).For you measure the low quality of this album, a cover of JOHNNY BE GOOD is the best thing in the whole album!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ewwww.,"OK, I love Priest, but this album is horrible. I am willing to forgive Rocka Rolla because it was their starting point, and the Ripper era if you can listen to cheesy lyrics. But this is simply Priest's worst album ever.The first song is AWESOME! Cheesy, but a good and fast paced starter. Then Heavy Metal comes along with an awesome intro... and the the song falls on its butt soon afterword. The other good track is Blood Red Skies, despite being a tad too ""techno"" for my tastes. Other than that this album sucks.I'm a Rocker? Ewww.Love You To Death? No Thanks.Hard as Iron? Uh, I was planning to KEEP DOWN the meal I just ate, not vomit it back up.Love Zone? Nope.Monsters of Rock? Monstorously bad.Lovezone? WAY EWWWWWW.Johnny B Goode? Way to rape a good song.This is the worst excuse for a Priest album than this. In the mid 80s they went downhill and released 3 bad albums, each worse than the other (Defenders of the Faith, Turbo, and now this). Thank God for painkiller.Just avioid this."
3,Return to Roots,"Some of these songs were intended for Twin Turbo album, and it shows. The drums are electronic, producing a mechanized feel. There simply just isn't as many good songs here as on other Priest album. When they hit, they hit haqrd, as in the title track, Heavy Metal and Hard as Iron, but those are few and far between. Still, it's worth picking up, as it is at least traditional metal Priest, unlike Turbo. This is still a good album, just not up to the usual Priest quality. Priest's return to regular metal would be solidified with the 1990 release of the masterpiece Painkiller, their last with Halford."
3,"""Mechanicially"" as they said ,this wasnt a total failure...","The next step after ""turbo"". This one finds them returning to their aggresive style. Rob goes back to screaming and k.k and Glenn rip into their gutars. The album is Alot mechanicial sounding as it's always been tagged. They defintley did need a new drummer whose last apperance was on this one. Some filler on this one especially the last track ""Monsters of rock"" but overall melodic and hard-hitten."
3,"Weak, but still worth it for the price...","If I had to rate all the Priest studio albums in order, I'd have to say Ram it Down would be at the bottom of the list, even under Turbo. The remaster has no new studio tracks, and the two live tracks are both weak. That being said, the album is still worth it to any Priest fan that doesn't have this on CD. Ram it down is pretty generic speed metal, but Heavy Metal is a bit better. I won't even dignify Love Zone, Come and and Get it, or Johnny B. Goode with comments. Hard as Iron and I'm a Rocker are passable, while Blood Red Skies, and Monsters of Rock are much better. Very dark and heavy doom sound, if a little long. If Ram it Down as an album has an overwhelming weakness, it's that the lyrics, never a strong point with Priest, are almost laughably generic in places. It's more than likely that some of Spinal Tap's hillarity was inspired by this band."
3,Better than Turbo...but that's not saying a whole lot,"This album was released in early 88'...almost 20 years. How time flies. Growing up in the 80's, I discovered Priest around 81' after hearing ""Steel"" and bought every successive album and even their 70's heyday material soon after 81'. However, I immediately lost interest in the band when I heard ""Turbo."" It sounded like they went ""Cinderella"" on us. I'm embarrassed that I still have that dusty cassette over 20 years later. Anyhow, ""Ram it down"" left me scratching my head. The guitar and vocals were truly great heavy metal experiences for any listener on most of the songs, especially the title track. What killed it was the lame Chuck Berry tune from a cheesy Anthony Michael Hall flick by the same name. Where does this fit in with the rest of the album? The lyrics were very infantile too. ""Ram it down....straight into the heart of this town."" Sounds like something a 4th grader wrote during lunch period."
2,The beginning of the end...,"""Ram it down"" gives us a wink of where Judas Priest were going, and while this album is far from the best once, it's clearly better than the previous dreadful ""Turbo"" and the awful ""Painkiller"" that followed. Some songs are quite good, especially the title track ""Ram it down"". But there are too many fillers and the cover of ""Johnny B Goode"" doesn't work at all.Judas Priest were in top form between 1978-1982 while they released the superb albums: ""Killing machine"", ""Unleashed in the east"", ""British steel"", ""Point of entry"", and ""Screaming for vengeance"". Nowadays I have totally lost interest in Judas Priest since I can't stand their attempts to be the most metallic band in the world. Halford on his own is much more interesting."
1,smash it down,"ram it down is one lousy album. good guitar work and pretty good vocals, but horrible songs. the title track is good, but rest of the album is poor. Blood red skies is decent, but love zone, come and get get, I'm a rocker all are weak. The album is filled with weak sounding drum machines and bad song writing. Ram it down is one album to skip"
2,Lots of filler,"After Turbo, Judas Priest tried to make a real heavy metal album. They ended up with just two good songs, Ram It Down and Hard as Iron. The rest of the album is pretty bad. The songs are based on weak riffs with dumb lyrics about rockin' all night long. *YAWN.* Johnny B. Goode is an interesting heavy metal re-write, but nothing special. Blood Red Skies is just a bad remake of The Sentinel (from Defenders of the Faith). And the bonus tracks are horrible --- the sound of Halford out of breath and disinterested as the band goes through the motions. It's all very loud, but also very boring and cheesy."
3,Not so bad at all!,"I agree that the lyrics here are sometimes nauseating, but as far as the music goes, this is a very solid record. It's hard and rough. Also, Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing display the beginning of the shredding technique they would use with great skill in Painkiller.What I don't understand here is Dave Holland's drumming. It seems that producer Tom Allom was making everything possible to mess the sound of his drums with each passing record since his debut in British Steel, finally succeeding in transforming it in a lifelees mechanic sound, what is a shame, since Dave is a great drummer (Check his work with TRAPEZE).RAM IT DOWN is not a bad album at all. No doubt it still suffered the influence of hair metal, but is fine heavy metal record, full of cliches and cheesy chorus, but with Judas Priest`s traditional ability flowing from the first to the last song. The bonus tracks, as with most bonus from this series, are not a big deal."
4,You Know What I Meeeeen!,"Most people would like to forget that Ram It Down exists, but like a rotten, stale eggsalad sandwich, you just can't keep it down. This album is considered just as bad if not worse than Turbo. I can see where this reputation came from, but personally I have a weak spot for a group that puts out something cornier than their usual work. Ram It Down is a guilty pleasure for me. It sounds like Painkiller-lite with a drum machine. And what about that album cover? Is that a textbook example of a heavy metal album cover or what? Now, to someone who wants to get into Priest, I wouldn't recommend Ram It Down. This one is reserved for those of us warmed up to Priest and dedicated enough fans to accept an album as silly as Ram It Down. That's not saying that only fans will appreciate this one, coz it's the fans who are the harshest critics on this album. But if you don't demand perfection from Priest every time and are willing to accept a slip up album, you should have fun."
2,Forgettable and Disappointing,"Every great band has a weak point or two and ""Ram it Down"" is Priest's. It's without a doubt the most forgettable and uninspired Priest album to be released.To me, it seemed that the band's collective fuel tank is pretty much on EMPTY for this one. Technically, the ablum is well-made. The muscianship is its usual brilliance. Rob ""Metal God"" Halford's wake-the-dead wail is there. The composition and arrangements are fine. Yeah, the album is functional, but it's missing Judas Priest's greatest strength: and that is the sense of rebellion, energy and edginess that just propelled earlier LP's.Without that energy, ""Ram it Down"" sounds just plain silly in most cases and difficult to take even a little seriously. About the only thing ""Ram it Down"" can do -- with tunes like ""Hard as Iron"", ""I'm a Rocker"", ""Come and Get it"" and ""Love Zone"" -- is make a fan truly appreciate their other material."
2,A Stinker,Pop sounding like Turbo but not as catchy. For the completist only. One of their worst albums. Like many bands with longevity not all their albums can be good.
2,Shoulda paid more for something else.,"I'm somewhat happy with this pressure cooker set. It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $ I paid, it is OK. I wish I'd bought a better cooker; I'm pleased with the results.This is a copy of my review of theManttra Smart 8-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker. It seems the products are the same but for color, and I bought the silver one."
3,Not a happy camper,Disappointed that the unrated version is only available on blu ray and I can't afford to buy blu ray players. It's also unfair that some unrated films are only available in that format like Saw VII and Terminator Salvation.
2,Poor,This movie was way overrated I really liked 1 and 2 but 3 was not that intense did not have the fear factor of the first 2.
3,My review.,"I'm only reviewing the bluray itself, not the movie. I actually enjoyed this movie when i saw it in theaters. The trailer was missleading but the movie still delivered. Now after the movie had ended I had thought that there must of been two completely different cuts of the film to explain why they made a trailer with scenes that for the majority of the part were not in the movie. alas i was wrong. in this bluray you get the theatrical release, and the unrated version, along side the lost tapes which is pretty much a bunch of scenes where the stepdad just scares his wife in funny places, and his promo commmercial selling himself as a video recorder for special occassions. really. thats it. thats the special ""lost tapes"" that is all. so do yourself a favor and buy the single dvd version of this movie. it is still a good movie to watch."
2,Not Scary Or Believable,"Paranormal Activity 3 is neither scary nor believable. First off, the story makes no sense. Is it a ghost, a demon or a coven? Get it straight. Second, who would videotape themselves watching a videotape? Strange behavior. Next, why would the ghost or the people allow recording. Finally, videotape was not widescreen and had poor low-light capability (this movie is dim but we can see what's going on).The kitchen scene is the only interesting scene in the entire movie.The best movie of this genre is still Blair Witch Project. Everything about that movie was somewhat believable.[DW]"
3,Not what I expected,The problem I had with this movie is the same as another reviewer. There were scenes that were shown in the trailer that were not in the movie. For instance the scene with the little girl throwing the water on some invisible being while her mother was there. The scene with a priest having his head slammed on a table by same said being. These were two scenes that drew me to want to watch this movie. There are also other various scenes not included. This instalment didn't add up to the other two movies in my opinion. They did set up movie number four though.
2,I was disappointed. . and irritated,"My 19 year old daughter saw this at the theater and came home terrified. I thought I don't know if I want to see a movie like that given my daughters reaction. But being the horror fan I am I finally took a chance and ordered it. Boy do I wish I hadn't.First off Micah got on my nerves THROUGHOUT THE THE WHOLE MOVIE taking all those bumps and strange occurrences as a joke, talking crap to the demon AND let's not leave out him going out getting a Ouija board after she pleaded with him not to. I mean really if someone tells you they've had stuff like that happening to them and it terrifies them where's the humor in that. . Then another point that irritated me was all this stuff was happening and Micah says don't call the demonologist. .""What?"" and of course by the time they did he was out of town. I wasn't scared by this I guess because I was so irritated by the time it ended. I think Blair Witch was a bigger scare than this. I was not feeling this movie at all."
3,We want more!,I enjoyed the movie with the exception of one thing...why did you cut out a lot of the movie we all wanted left in??? Are the clips from the trailers going to be added to make an extended version??? I collect movies and will not buy this unless the scenes will be added. In my opinion it would have made the movie a lot better. I am speaking for a group of ten of us that saw this in the theatre. Hope to see the footage added!!!
4,IT'S STILL GOOD...,"Ok, I admit- I love the genre, so I'm biased a bit. BUT, it wasn;t the best of the series, and it's not as good as Bake Street Hauntings (and yes, BSH technically came first like someone mentioned). Everyone knows adding kids always makes us care more about the characters. Good idea..I think they should move on now to new story. Evil doesn't just haunt one group of people, hehe."
2,A weak attempt at best...,"First and foremost, there are no such things as ghosts, demons, angels, witches, sasquatch, wizards... You get the idea. I enjoy supernatural horror for the same reasons I enjoy zombie flicks, crappy alien movies, etc., because they are an escape from the every day reality of life. This entire series of movies was mediocre, with painfully delivered dialogue and only your basic boo-and-jump moments scattered through. This one was easily the worst of the three as it brought in the element of a coven of old lady witches to explain the ""origins"" of the fictional villain. The parallel was unnecessary in that it brought no additional believability or involvement to the story, much like the map arguement in Blair Witch.All told, if you're a fan of the genre the you should watch it. Maybe you'll get something out of it that I didn't.But rent it, don't buy it. It's not a watch-more-than-once type of a film."
2,"No. Just, no.","If you like seeing a camera taped to a rotating fan for 70% of the movie...Then this movie is for you. So many flaws also. It's 1988 and it looks to be filmed in HD. The overall setting looked to be in todays world. The first two sucked, so I shouldn't be surprised this one does too. It brings absolutely nothing new. Leaves unaswered questions that will probably wont get answered. The only thing that was good, was the littlest girls acting. Two stars just for her."
1,Unfortunately unimpressive,"I'll put it this way. I'm at the scene with the babysitter. She looks like a barbie doll. I saw her and immediately started singing ""I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie worrrrlldd"" in my head. When you can do that during this sort of movie and still not feel any odd effect or feel jarred or anything at all.. well, that kinda tells you what sort of movie it is.It's not that it's a bad movie. The acting is decent, the sets are very nice, costuming is perfectly fine and the writing is alright. It's just.. dull. Dull and long and... yeah.I'm finishing this review just as the babysitter scene is ending and I'm STILL hum-thinking Aqua in my head.Likin' Plastic. It's fan-tasticcc."
2,1 GOOD 2 GREAT 3 NOT SO MUCH,I think after seeing all 3 Paranormals this one was a let down... big let down. What happened? Who dropped the ball? I thought the second one was the best and should have stopped while they were ahead.
3,Worth watching,"This is a prequel to the Paranormal Activity film, and this one shows how the haunting of Katie and her sister began. Once again, this one is full of tension, and the filmmakers have been able to maintain a level of quality through three films in the trilogy. The first was quite groundbreaking and hasn't been matched, but the second one was also quite good, the third to a lesser extent. There are some cheap scares in this one, but they provide a bit of levity at times. This should be the last of the trilogy, and is worth seeing."
3,...,"I thought this movie was supposed to be scary! HA this movie cracked me up more than anything. I wasnt scared once, nothing made me jump. All I did was laugh. Worst one of them all!!"
3,"PA3 entertaining, forgetable","PA1 scared me. I was checking over my shoulder looking out for any malevolent entities in my house. I adapted to the style, which is why PA2 was less scary. Sure, it had some tense moments but it was the same movie as the first.PA3 is like PA2. It will make you jump a few times but by now you're getting used to it, so it's losing its power. I predicted the plot for PA3 once a certain character was introduced. The film runs like Blair Witch in the end and leaves a ton of unanswered questions.Not bad. It's just human nature to adjust to something once you've experienced it enough times."
3,They really could have made this movie better,"PA1 was fantastic. Really had you checking under your bed. PA2 was great too. The guys basically handled the haunting in the same way, but you'd expect that as these story lines happened parallel to each other (same time period). But, it's like they slapped PA3 together like late homework. Then there's the same story line with oh, something's happening so the guy puts up cameras and nobody notices what's on the film til it's too late. The people that made PA1 and PA2 showed a true gift. Guess the gift ran out!"
1,movie,Did not get to see it as it did not load. Wish I could have seen it. So i really dont have a review on the movie.
1,Cheap gags for this one,"Unfortunately they went really cheap with the effects and did what so many do take a good story and copy other movies as they can't come up with anythig better. The first was great,the second was ok this well it's b grade I would expect the fourth won't be any better"
3,Good but disappointed,I was so cited to see this because I love the original and the sequel. Plus the trailer made it promising but I was discourage because they 180 the storyline and thought it could have been better.
4,"Best in series, but still doesn't explain anything",This one certainly has alot more action than the first two. Where they slowly build up to the ending in a put you to sleep pace. This one after 20 minutes starts up the activities heavy. But still doesn't explain at the end exactly what is doing the haunting? Witches? Bloody Mary? Demons? Largely leaves the events of the first two still up in limbo.A bit deceiving as they don't have many of the scenes from the trailer in the actual movie just like they did in the second one. You know where Katie walks into the room from the bathroom in the second one. The third one does this even more. The bathroom scene with the person showing after they say the words. Not in movie. The pyshic guy from the trailer. Not in the movie either. A bit dissappointing that you use cut scenes to advertise the movie.
2,least favorite and a dumb ending,a few good scares thats why I didn't give it a one but a real let down and i thought the ending was really lame don't understand how they could advertise it would mess you up for life
2,It was OK,"I had heard of this movie from a friend at work. Sorta reminded me of Close Encounter of the Fourth Kind there at the end. I knew I shouldn't watch these kinds of movies, they give me nightmares. lol I'll give it one thumb up as it did scare me and make the hair stand on end on my arms and back of my neck at times."
4,Do NOT open the door...,"Being a fan of the first two movies, I had high hopes for this one. While I didn't find this to be the scariest of the bunch, it is still enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though, it definitely has it's scary moments (bloody mary scene anyone?). If you're like me, you thought you had a fairly good grasp of the story based on the first two films...this one just opens up a whole can of worms. The ending is relatively confusing and leaves a lot of questions unanswered...which leads into the inevitable sequel. Over all if you liked the first two, you'll probably like this one...and if you didn't like them then you'll probably hate it."
4,Better than expected or told it would be,"My boyfriend and I are surprised because we know a couple who went hog-wild over the first two PAs but hated this one. This one may seem a little slower only because all of us are familiar with the formula! I say this because we watched 1 and 2 again this week after watching #3 online here and 1 and 2 were ""slow"" too but we didn't recall thinking that originally.PA3 has an ample supply of gotchas with a satifying ending that is as plausible as #1 with a little extra punch.If you liked 1 and 2 and are hesitating on 3, you should not."
2,"Been there done it ,got my tee shirt,","I saw saw paranormal activity 1, 2 and now 3. this last of the franchise was my least favorite. The first two were very creepy. I fully understand this film is suppose to take you back to the beginning. I felt the movie was slow and didn't offer anything we haven't seen before.I got the impression there was a Subliminal message from the film maker. 'We need to milk this dry"". If your'e going to ask us to come back, show us something new and inovated, not the cheap tricks of having someone jump out of a closet with a mask."
4,I liked it.,I know some people don't really care for movies such as these but I enjoyed it. It shows of what happened to the two sisters when they were younger and has an interesting story to it. I would say that you could watch this one before the other two as it is more of a prequel in a sense. I would recommend this to anybody who has seen the first two or to anybody has an interest in the genre.
2,The subtlety that made this series interesting is gone.,"The creepy factor has been replaced with the shock factor. However, nearly every other horror film uses the latter as its primary ""scare"" point. Thus, the interesting parts of the PA series are drastically minimized. What's more, it's rather obvious that the producers are revving up the Fonz' Norton to jump the shark due to the obvious limitations of security camera focused cinematography."
5,Paranormal Activity 3,"This trilogy of horror films in my opinion are great, very entertaining. I very good plot, everything ties in together really good. Showing how It all begins is a great ending. I'am ready for part 4. Kim Jones"
3,"Same good movie, diffrent wrapper.","It was almost as good as the first one, but the jumps are lessened because you know what to expect."
4,Still Scary!!!,"This movie was just as scary as the first part. It has the same suspenseful-edge-of-your-seat quality. AND just to kill the monotony, a few extra things were thrown in to keep it interesting. I really enjoyed it. I have all 3 parts in my dvd collection. Will there be a 4th part? Who knows. If so, I think it will be worth looking at."
1,Verry Dissapointed!!!,"I rented this one because I love the whole premise. Everything I was looking forward to from the commercials on tv was not in the movie. Because of that, I will wait for 4 to come on video to rent instead of wasting my money on buying it or going to the theater."
2,Not What I Expected !!!!!,The Movie doesn't deliver the chill through your spine as of what the first part did..... Second part was ok too but this was nutt even close.I just hope they make the 4th one worth watching and make u jump of ur seat.There were not many parts except 1 or 2 where you gonna have eerie kinda feeling and thinking that somehing gonna happen now. Even the ending wasn't up to the mark.Just an Average movie to kill some time if you have nutt to watch.
4,"Scary, but not life changing.","I personally went and saw this movie in theatre with a few friends the night that it came out and was very pleased with the movie. I'm a scary movie buff and of course after watching the first and second paranormal activity I was hooked on these types of movies. This movie is done much in the same way, with the whole film being shot as a series of ""home movies"", and much like the other movies paranormal happenings do not start happening right in the beginning, as there is a little bit of a story line to go with the scaryness. I will admit that even I didn't catch on to what was happening until the last seconds of the movie, and right as you figure out what is happening the movie ends. But I have to say that I will be buying this movie and that every penny will be worth each scream and jump that I experience. And as for the ""the last 15 minutes will mess you up for life."" part of the advertising.. the movie is scary, but not quite enough to mess me up for life."
1,So Bored !,"I'm sorry but this was the most boring movie I've seen in some time.Check it out for yourself, you will know what I'm talking about.Don't be fooled by these reviewers who ARE IN FACT members of the movie, or have had some part to do with production.This movie deserves 1 star, and I'm being honest... as an outsider of this film.This movie was flipping HORRIBLE!!! That's all I have to say.Money well WASTED. You'll see. This is a terrible movie.Do NOT waste your money or time! All I gotta' say."
1,Not that good.,Honestly after watching the 1st one I don't know why I even bothered to rend this one. Almost exactly the same story line guy grabs camera after strange things start happening..blah blah blah.Low Budget film.
1,Not Worth My Time,I watched the first Paranormal Activity when it came out on video and wasn't too pleased with it. I never watched the 2nd one and when this one came out I heard a lot of good things from other people I know that it was an awesome movie. Let me just say that this movie was a complete waste of my time. I was very disappointed after hearing all good things about it. It was way too slow for me and boring. The scary parts weren't even that scary. Good thing I only spent $1.20 renting it.
2,BORED TO THE POINT OF SLEEP,"So unimpressed, i simply went to bed and just passed out within the first 30 minutes... if you liked the first and second films, you will be sorely disappointed."
4,Second Best,In my opinion the second one was the best. Then this one is second best. The only scary party of the third one was the bathroom scene. The second one was scary throughout the whole movie. I've bought all three. I hope there will be a fourth and fifth continuation.
3,Hmmmm,"Overall, this movie was probably more fun to make than to watch. I guess if you havent seen anything like this before, which I hardly will watch anything of this sort, it was not too shabby. Not too scary and not too messy.So I give it an overall 3 star rating."
3,good until the end,"Pretty decent and scary, just like the other 2 paranormal activity movies- right up until the end. I really enjoyed these films but thought that the ending was horrible."
3,seen one seen them all,"Paranormal 3 follows the same formula as the previous two movies .........hey lets pull the door shut with fishing line and toss furniture across the room with scary noises when no one is around. This is supposed to take place in 1988 but its not very convincing, the movie still has a very modern 2012 feel to it. The ending is pretty crazy. I still like the first one the best."
4,a great general survey of a rarely discussed topic,"The motif of Jesus' victory of the devil and demons is a theme that Garrett persuasively argues is underappreciated by scholars. She delves into the background of witchcraft and ancient Near Eastern thought about the devil inside and outside Judaism during the time of Christ. For a reader interested in biblical literature and wants a scholarly rather than just a pastoral approach to spiritual warfare as a motiff in biblical literature Garrett is the only author I've come across who covers the subject at all, as most Western scholars tend to ignore the subject of demonology in the New Testament or just defer to specialists of apocryphal literature. She wrote a book called The Temptation of Jesus in the Gospel of Mark that is also an interesting read on this subject as it appears in the other synoptic Gospel."
5,Awesome Reading,"I read this book many years ago in Russian, now that I have grown up I am reading it again. It is wonderfuly written. I do not know about the english version, but the Russian verson was just brilliant. Can't put it down, the royal dances to the horrific changes in Russian history, tied in with the roamance. I love this book. Reccomend it to anyone. Enjoy!"
3,Not for everybody,"Lean for Life is not a balanced diet. At its core it's a high-protien, low-carb program. This works well for some people, but not for everybody. I felt fatigued, cranky, and hungry almost continually after my 5th day in ketosis. I experienced more strong food cravings than I have on any other program (and I've done them all.)I've found that I do much better on a 40-30-30 type of program. Your body may do well on the Lindora program... just be sure you follow the instructions carefully, and don't stay on the weight-loss program for extended periods of time."
5,It is so simple and the pounds just disappear!,I love this book. It is my weight loss/weight control bible! I have lost 55 lbs. on this plan and did it in 4 months. It is very simple to read and is motivating. If you stick with the book and the way you need to eat the pounds will disappear. I have been on several diets and this is the easiest and the fastest! I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs to lose weight!
1,NOT FOR STUDENTS,"This book is no good for students, as it has exercises with answers only available to lecturers though a password system.The examples are ok but do not help for the exercises so it makes the book imcomplete and very dissappointing, If you need help for real time systems then this is not the book for you, If you just want to read a book this might be ok, but learning is not going to be done.(...)"
5,Have you not read this...it is a must read!,This book presents the 7 disciplines that are required for an abundant and successful Christian life. This is a must read!
1,The recipes are wrong,"The book looks great, but the recipes are bad. Try to find a Thai cooking book that is written by a Thai person."
5,Wonderful book...a family ancestry book for me,"Did a family tree and found out I am a decendant of this family,it is great finding a book I can read about my ancestors.their reign,their life and tribulations."
5,Does its job well,"I use this for my lighting stand. It is what it is; it's durable, intuitive and simple. I used my lighting setup for a dance, and it was a big hit- it would have been impossible without this controller."
2,Shiped Broken,"works like its supposed too but the 8th rocker switch was broken so i have to replace it, seems like it was used and they just re shipped it as new, the box was basically made out of tape, works great but 2 stars because it was damaged when i got it."
1,Eliminator Lighting Controllers PL-07 a junk,"Eliminator Lighting Controllers PL-07 Stage Light Accessory (Electronics)Sure this thing is only around $20, but this thing was built horribly. I had to snap the buttons back into the metal face plate as they were coming out from the factory. After a few times of switching button #1, it failed and wouldn't turn off. Another button stayed partially illuminated even when off. This is junk, stay away."
3,ok saltwater only game,"Bad graphics, great sound, nice underwater graphics, good sound, mind-boggling variety. An OK SALTWATER FISHING game (no Largemouth here but 1000 + pound Marlins are around!).Bottom-line_ an ok choice to add to your fishing collection f ya like big/saltwater fish."
5,Love this game,I love this game. The only sea fishing game I can find. I like that it saves your fish records in the gallery
4,Bought for the hit single,"When I purchased my IBM Thinkpad notebook PC many, many years ago, it had a sample A-V file which was the music video ""Good Times"". When I upgraded, I missed this song and ordered the CD which included it. I was pleasantly surprised to find gems such as track 11, ""Like I Do Now"". Most of the songs were more soulful (such as this one), instead of upbeat like the song I originally wanted, but it made for greast easy listening in the evening. Although not a chart-topper, it's a solid album."
3,Teaching With the Brain in Mind,"I'm rating this book a 3 based upon my need for the information. I was looking for a more condensed version of information in order to quickly gleen and gather information for a workshop. However, the book includes good information, especially for newer teachers."
2,Book for course,"Again, this book was used for my college education course. Very good reference book. This book was an excellent source for my course."
2,Awful smell,"I don't know what all the rave to this product is about, but it smells so awful. I received it as pictured, but when I opened the bottle to use it, it smelled really bad; there's a fishy combined with trash smell. It's so bad that after the 3rd day I felt too weird using it so I can't comment on the effectiveness itself but it does absorb quickly and the packaging is nice which I give it a 2 star."
2,No Real Difference To Nails,"Well, I've been applying this product 2-3 times a day to my stumpy toenails which never seem to grow past the quick for almost a full month now. I've followed the instructions carefully (massaging the oil into the nail and cuticle), but my nails are still super short and janky.I did notice that they seem more supple/flexible than before.I've also applied to to my fairly normal fingernails as I go and though they aren't growing any father than usual, the tops do seem a bit smoother. Overall, not the best product if you're trying to grow sandal-worthy nails in a short period of time. It does seem like it would be nice for people with brittle, flaky nails, though!"
5,WOW!,"I have actually never had nails! All the sudden, my nails started growing a little so I bought this stuff to keep them strong! Now..they are definitely stronger now! Will continue to buy and use this! Also my nails look healthier, including the cuticles!(sp)"
5,Wow,"I was not expecting this to work, but I thought that I would at least give it a shot. Lone behold, it actually made my nails tougher and grew them quicker. I was shocked that it worked. I would recommend this product."
2,doesnt work for me,"after reading all the positive reviews on this product, i was excited to try it out. i have average length nails but i wanted them to grow longer and i have been applying this product on my nails 2 times a day and after 5 days, i have not seen a difference. my nails aren't growing any faster or longer. well at least i don't notice it.. it may work for others out there but i wouldn't recommend this product.."
4,Great in its own way,"I got Scottish Ghost Stories ten years ago whilst on vacation in Scotland and it continues to prove an interesting read. It's a collection of 12 different stories with a couple of great illustrations by Tim Hunt for each.The stories range from those about hidden rooms at Glamis Castle to glowing ladies in the night and scary dark cellars. At least half of the stories are excellent, although they're all quite readable but one or two do drag a little.Many of the stories are those which the author has heard from others or are contributions. They all seem to have the same style though, ..., they're still great to read.The style of writing could prove a little '1940s English' for some, but most books by older authors are like this."
3,Fun read for the nighttime,"Good compilation of stories. Well selected and well written. We will add them to our Halloween times! Good, solid ghost story buy."
4,Scottish ghost stories,"I'm enjoying this read very much, it reminds. me of the many days and nights listening to my mother and her friends telling simaller stories in our home in Glasgow, now I reside in Australia. I'm back in Scotland a frightened you girl again!. It must be a good read to do that.Elizabeth irvine"
2,"No magic, literally or figuratively","I was a little surprised that someone could take such a rich story and boil all the flavor out of it. This is simplified to the point of boredom. Until the last few pages, it appears to be the story of four men of various sizes who fight a war while young boys watch from the bushes. I liked the artwork, but my three-year-old daughter and I were wondering where the rest of the story went. Maybe a younger child would be OK with it, but there are many, many books out there that will stir the imagination of a young child more than this one."
3,Fun Easy Reader,"Reason for Reading: Ds read aloud to me as his reader.A very basic bones representation of the King Arthur story telling the part where Merlin claims whoever can remove the stone from the sword will be the king. All kinds of princes try at no avail and then Merlin tricks the boy Arthur into pulling the sword form the stone. We picked this one up this week as we needed a quick read for ds and I'm rather more impressed with the story than I thought I would be. He laughed and certainly enjoyed the story and the pictures, though he already knows parts of the Arthurian legend. Reading level was spot on for him, mostly easy with a few harder words to make the book a learning opportunity as well. A fun easy reader."
4,Estleman Hits Where He Aims,"And he aims right for the gut. If you are familiar with the Walker series, you know what I mean. If not, this series is not a procedural (like CSI on TV), nor psychological thriller. It's a fast story with a hard-boiled heart. Amos Walker, PI, matches wit and humor with everyone he comes across. Smart characters/devious motivations/muscle cars seem to be the backdrop of each of his stories. Why not? It's the backdrop of Detroit. I agree with the other reviewer that stated Walker is fresh, even as he ages. I only complain a little about the ending. Highly recommended."
3,more progressive,i can say that dj networx vol. 10 is a part of new progressive fashion in trance. good for hard energy listeners bad for pure trance listeners. for me? I believe in trance in both ways
5,Audubon exposed!,"I am pleased to give my unprejudiced review of Under A Wild Sky by William Souder, my son.The author paints a picture, in words, of a 19th century complicated man, dedicated to giving his and future generations beautiful and accurate portraits of Birds Of America. This is a great book for all interested in learning about the life of the man and his work."
5,air deflectors,This is a great product shipped quickly and it works great on my harley. When you need a breeze you open when its cold you close it and works very well.
4,I thoroughly enjoyed the book.,"Although I found the book interesting and very readable, I was often reminded of Carlos Castaneda. I knew nothing about Ms. donner previously so I was surprised to find that she was acquainted with Mr. Castaneda. The book probably is fairly accurate as far as the cultural anthropology is concerned but there are many areas that are not believable. I would recommend this book as a light read about the Yanomamo."
1,A Sham,"A badly written hoax by someone who never actually lived with the Yanomami, this book features the convoluted adventures of a woman who decides to live in a community of Brazilian Indians. To those familiar with the Yanomami (I lived with them for 5 years) this is obvious fakery, although my edition of the book did not claim that the book was ""a true story"" or ""nonfiction"". Among other clues: she describes a Yanomami wedding ceremony--when in fact no such ceremony exists among the Yanomami, a fact you might know if you had read one or two of the many ethnographies on this tribe."
5,I enjoyed the journey with her into the jungle.,"A very captivating story. As I was reading I could almost feel like I was there with her in the jungle living what's like to be completely fusing with the nature without any necessity of the ""civilized word""Serene"
2,A SUBJECTIVE view,"This is a decent story telling book, completely subjective. It leaves a lot to be desired and a more factual OBJECTIVE anthropology book would be necessary to understand the yanomamo indians because the author tells her story but doesn't explain the signifigance of myths, rituals, and customs."
1,Only if you're looking for Indian Culture NOT shamanism,"If you're familiar with Castaneda's work, this is NOTHING like it. It's a book a about Florinda's experience with indians. It has a lot about they're culture, and some far references to shamanism (as part of the indian comunity). It's NOT a book in witch you will learn about shamans like Castaneda.A have not yet read her other books concerning Don Juan's teachings. I believe they are worth a try.I feel like I've lost my time, hence this review. And I haven't even bought the book."
3,Okay,It is okay. Half of the songs on it are real obscure and not real great hit records. The other half is real good and some teriffic finds.
3,Not as shown in the photo,"The box I received is not as shown in the picture. Mine is a light color, not dark, and has no latch on the front. That said, it does look nice on the outside, with a high-quality look to the wood. Inside the box the leather lining (I'm not convinced it is leather) is not glued down very tightly and easily lifts as you put the watches in and take them out. I expect that it will look shabby on the inside pretty quickly. On the plus side, it does seem to work well."
4,A good introduction to an alt.country legend,"A legendary '70s troubadour/country clown/stoner god/party animal, Jerry Jeff was an icon 'way back when, and he's still kicking and touring and making great records today. His independently-owned Tried and True label has had a great track record so far; Walker's new material is at least as good as any of his classic ""outlaw"" material on MCA... This 12-song sampler isn't quite as comprehensive as 2001's somewhat similar ""Ultimate Collection,"" but it's a fine set in and of itself. Includes a surprising number of Jerry Jeff's raunchier cult classics, and will certainly do in a pinch. Diehard fans will, of course, have to seek out the original albums, but anyone who just wants to get their feet wet and see what all the fuss is about will find this disc pretty useful. I wish they could've included ""London Homesick Blues"" as well, but hey, you can't have everything! This is a good look at a warm, humorous performer with a very human persona."
5,reproducing my vinyl collection,"All of the CD's I ordered I had on the original vinyl albums, which I still have, all scratched up and covers water damaged... Jerry Jeff remains one of my all time favorite singer/songwriters, along with John Prine and James Taylor. It's a pleasure to have the option to order whatever books/music I want so easily... My only problem is that I want too much!"
1,Will make you curse,"Even the most righteous among us will curse when trying to use this shower. First of all the hose kinks easily so to use it must be kept straight but, with the shut-off valve at the bag, the shower head will be at your chest or you won't be able to reach the valve to turn the water on and off. O.K. so I cut the hose so it was about 4"" long and that solved that problem. HOWEVER - while turning the valve on and off the cap popped off half emptying the bag before I got it back on. This happened several times including once while I was hanging it up while fully clothed. Oh yea - there was some cussing."
4,"Strange, but I like it",Cephalic Carnage drop state of the art bombs of schizophrenic death/grind unto the ears of the unsuspecting. Dare to comprehend Cephalic's self-proclaimed Rocky Mountain hydro-grind.
5,Correct Tracklist,Amazing album and I just wanted to put up the correct tracklisting in case anyone cared.1. Hybrid 04:172. Driven to Insanity 01:063. Rehab 05:494. Observer to the Obliteration of Planet Earth 03:125. On Six 00:066. Gracias 05:027. Cryptosporidium 04:278. The Ballad of Moon 01:509. 9 Feet of Smoke 03:1310. Warm Hand on a Cold Night (A Tale of Onesomes) 00:1111. Invertus Indica (The Marijuana Convictions) 04:4312. Molestandos Plantas Muertos! 01:1113. Eradicate Authority 05:5214. Paralyzed by Fear 01:3815. Exploiting Dysfunction 15:26
5,This cd rules!,"Pretty amazing stuff from cephalic carnage right here... I enjoy every song & the lirycs are very well writting---Personally cephalic carnge makes me kinda jelaus for some reason, i quess cause their music sounds to good & realy , realy original. A must have if your into extreme deathmetal! Cephalic carnage rules!"
5,Exploiting dysfuntion indeed...,"Where to start? This stuff is insane , jumping from insanely fast -paced grind to groovy deathmetal even to some jazz/fusion type stuff and the guys in cephalic carnage even managed to throw in some wierd noise bleeps,sound effects,and movie samples. the songs range from 6 seconds (""On Six"") to 15 minutes (""exploiting dysfunction""),and the lyrics deal from splicing mice with marijuana to school killings,alien abdution and even a song (""gracias"") that is all band names growled/screamed. + vocals vary from very low death growls to a high pitched kind of scream.Also the production is quite good where you can hear everything clearly while having a muddy-ish sound to it. All in all an intense and fun musical experience and one of my favorite cd's. Enjoy!!! :-)"
5,"Pure ""Rocky Mountain Hydrogrind"" @ it's best!","This is one of the most surprisingly great cd's I have heard this year. ""Exploiting Disfunction"" is jam packed w/ top of the line grind but also offers plenty of strange atmospheric parts and even jazz/blues-like riffs to add variety and keep you tuned in. This album is amazingly original and loaded with talent. I have found that I am compelled to listen to it often."
4,It'll Grow On You,"Cannabis is an obscure band from Rhode Island who released their only album on a tiny indie label in 1972. While made up of admitted tokers, there's only one pot oriented lyric that I noticed. While there's some good rock'n'roll songs on here, for the most part, this leans towards mellow west coast folk/rock/country with good vocal harmonies not too far from the sound of groups like the Grateful Dead, Moby Grape, New Riders Of The Purple Sage etc., and maybe even a bit of influence from groups like Humble Pie and The Original Caste. While it's nothing brilliant, it's certainly enjoyable and it grows on you with every listen. The sound quality is lacking at times, but it's a nice relic of a another era, and for those who enjoy this kind of laid back hippie music, a nice addition to your CD collection. Kick back, relax, and enjoy Cannabis."
5,Price is right,"When I bought these products, they were on sale. So, I bought them and thought they were really cheap compared to the other ones. For the price I paid, these items were really good. Also, they are reliable and looks cute."
4,"Good quality, esp for the price","This is a very nice set, and the stainless steel cup it comes with also feels very high quality. I really enjoy using these tools."
5,Kitchen Tools,"I have been looking for something better than the plastic stuff you can get at the supermarket, but the kitchen specialty stores are so expensive. This looks great and works great for a small price. You can't get any better than that."
5,Excellent canister and utensil set,"I concur with the previous reviewers, this canister and utensil set is a terrific buy. Not only is the price a bargain, the set is beautifully made and classy looking. As stated in other reviews, there is room in the canister to add a few other utensils one may own and the canister/utensils are sturdy. I'm very happy with my purchase."
3,"Good for the price, but not perfect","I concur with many of the favorable reviews in that this product's quality is good for it's price. The only detraction (also mentioned) is that food sticks slightly more than teflon (but what do you expect?), thereby requiring additional cleaning. Overall, a worthwhile purchase."
4,A Good General Introduction to Magnetic/Nutritional Products,"The US is a relatively new marketplace for magnetic products so I think this book is a wonderful primer for those who are curious about magnetics for health and want to try them out for themselves. I tried some of his suggestions on some personal ""owies"" and found his advice helpful. The nutritional information was very enlightening. It was information that I hadn't read anywhere else in my extensive studies. I appreciated Dr. Whitaker's honest investigation and lack of hype in his book. This is not a book that condemns medical treatments but only suggests adding some non-invasive alternatives to our wellness arsenal."
3,DOES NOT FIT A 2002 NISSAN ALTIMA,"This switch fits the 1998-2001 Nissan Altimas and apparently other vehicles, but it will not fit on the 2002 Altimas. The 2002-2005 Altima switch has 2 sets of plug in wires (this one has 1), has 3 screws bolts mounting it (this one has 4 ), even the length is different. The picture only shows the bottom 2 bolt holes so you cannot see the difference until you receive the product. Amazon needs to change their compatibility chart to not show the 2002 Altima for this product. I requested a full refund and it looks like they will do that but it means shipping the item back to them and waiting 10 days for a refund. Hope this helps. NOTE: This item arrived quickly and was new in the box. No problem there. I gave it 3 stars but I was unable to test it."
3,Not a Toy,"This is not a toy. If a child were to play with it, it would break. It is more of a model built for display. I would not recommend this for a child who wanted to play with a ship.As a pre-built model, it's not too bad. None of the parts move (the turrets) but I would buy this or other products like it again for display purposes."
4,Very good overview of narrative fiction in Latin America,"Lindstrom's book is a nice history of Spanish American fiction since the arrival of the Spaniards until the end of the 19th century. It is clearly organized in 6 chapters, plus an introduction and a conclusion, and you can find useful information about most of the narratives that are part of the cannon of Spanish American fiction. In that sense, it is not a revolutionary or innovative work, and owes a lot to the previous research by scholars such as John Brushwood, although Lindstrom incorporates recent scholarship as well in her work. That's the only reason I do not give it 5 stars. Note also that the book does not include the literature of Brazil or other non Spanish-speaking countries of the continent (it is not Latin American narrative, only Spanish American).Recommended for libraries and students interested in Spanish American literature and culture."
5,The best of Roger Whittaker,This is a wonderful album for someone who's never experienced the multifaced singer and entertainer. His classic singing is distict and enjoyable. It also makes a great gift between good friends.
4,music,Roger's rich voice would make singing the dictionary sound good. Very relaxing to unwind after too many hours at a stressful job.
1,Where's The Story Line???,"The only reason I got this game was because of the extremely cheap price. This game was't worth a dime of it. And where's the story line? You just go around shooting and that's it. Don't let the price fool you into buying this good-for-nothing game. Instead get Syphon Filter of Metal Gear Solid. Not only do they have a story line, but they're better."
4,It touches your heart,"Nicholas Gunn's first Chrismas album. Hear one of the world's most beloved flutists, you will fall in love with it, especially if you like flute."
2,Unspiring,"As much as I love Nicholas Gunn's music, this CD leaves me uninspired. It's sedate and lacks creative arrangements."
4,Melodic Surrealism,"This album is the product of several creative minds experimenting with the electronic music frontier. It has obvious influence from Skinny Puppy, Frontline Assembly, and Circle of Dust. It has atmospheric textures of electronic sound flowing over a foundation of melodies. It feels surreal and chaotic, but within the chaos is rhythmic structures in beautiful harmony. It is just as great as Buka's first project, Argyle Park. My only criticism is in it's volume of content. Whereas Argyle Park had 34 total tracks, 16 of which were actually songs; AP2 has 12. The best tracks on Suspesion of Disbelief are Heroin Hate, My Sympathies, Sillouette of Rage, The Pact, and Resurrection of the Ravens."
2,An average song by an average band,This song is well tolerable. I am not a fan of the spice girls but i suppose if you are a fan that this song would most likely appeal to you as it is better than most of its predecessors
3,itty bitty replacements,"You need replacements, well, as far as the lamp that goes with these, well, my kids have had them for some time and use them all the time so the quality of the lightbulbs is great- I was sent a couple replacements with the light when they got them for gifts but to this day have not had to replace them."
4,Too expensive but convenient to order online,"Bulbs are not built to last, but whatever special filament and glass, gives much better light that cheap imitation replacement bulbs"
2,Purchased by mistake - confusing suggestions on website,"I made a mistake in buying these as I had purchased the itty bitty slimline book light, that does not use these type of bulbs. It was confusing as the replacement bulbs were listed as items often purchased with the slimline book light and I did not realise that the larger book light was listed there as well. So now I have some light bulbs that I don't need."
4,Zelco Booklight Replacement,"It's been so long I don't remember this purchase, but I am sure they worked otherwise I would remember."
5,-work great,"it is not that easy to find these bulbs in stores, so it was great to find them on Amazon. They work as well as the original bulb it came with."
5,Itty Bitty Booklights and Bulbs,These are my favorite reading lights and I was having difficulty finding them in stores so was glad when I found them on Amazon.
4,Itty bitty light bulbs,"product was as advertised, quick delivery. Could have been a tad more reasonable on the shipping costs considering the size of the items being shipped. Otherwise a good experience."
5,Good deal,This was a great deal on the replacement bulbs. I would not recommend buying a bulb that is not Zelco brand because they burn out immediately.
3,Case is for smaller cameras only,I bought this case because it was advertised as holding medium to large phones. I bought a canon powershot and thought it was a medium to large camera. There is no way that my camera will fit in this case. If you have a small camera this case would do well for you though.
2,Dry and dull,"The topic is very interesting and I had high hopes when I began reading it. However, quickly the material becomes too involved and told in very dull language. I would look else where for a book about the Supreme Court. There are many good ones."
2,Such a complicated book,I enjoyed the writer's style and characterizations but the book kept getting more complicated as it went along so that I finally held up my hands in surrender. Perhaps its too much like real life to me.
4,Unbelievable Characters - but great fun.,"This was my first contact with Whiskey and her Afghan. Mysteries galore keep you guessing throughout. The story moves at a fast pace, with a light and humurous touch. I was left wanting more and will certainly be reading other books in the series."
4,I can hardly wait for the TV series,"Like any great TV series featuring small town America (think Northern Exposure meets Twin Peaks), Whisky on the Rocks' strongest points are its people and its place. Magnet Springs is a quiet country town where all is not as it would appear in Whisky's realty brochures. Smart, funny, and full of life, this book's mystery is mearly one of the reasons to return over and over to the world Ms. Wright has created. These characters have legs, meaning it feels like a world we will definitely want to visit in future books to come. Bartender, give me another."
5,Mysteries,This is a light delightful tale and especially good story because it includes a devilish Afghan hound! Can't wait to read the others!
4,Forget the blurbs,"It's a shame that the book jacket markets it as just another blood-and-guts crime book. Blurbs like 'Violence'Blood-smeared and naked.' and 'the punch of a sledge hammer' do more harm than good.Yeah, the book is about a bank robbery. Yeah, there's a bit of blood. But those things are not the key to the genius of the book. That key is the dialog. More than half the book is dialog. The plot jumps through its incredible use. No wonder it was made into a movie. It's everything a movie should be. Action, character development, plot, atmosphere, everything is carried, and carried amazingly well, by the dialog. Too bad this book will end up only on the shelves of hard-boiled fans. It should be required reading in Script-writing 101."
2,Super Sweet Harmonies,"The harmonies are honey sweet. Their 3 voices meld perfectly together.I wish I could say the same for their songwriting. The lyrics themselves are straight up and forthright with little embellishment or simile.While these gals have most excellent voices their own songs are not quite ready for prime time. The songs on this disc vary seem to be written from either the ""Mother with Kids"" or ""Single & Looking"" viewpoints. The only gems on the disc are written by other folks & you can hear the difference.I bet the Chenille Sisters are great live but their probable stage presence doesn't translate on the CD.I'd skip this one unless you're a fan."
5,Tough Times,"This was a very sensitive documentary and captured my heart. The content focused only on the poor, innercity child of color though. I wish it had broadened its scope and included children and grandparents from all walks of life.I am grandmom/mom - we adopted our 7 year old grandson in December of 2007. Yes, we are white, yes we make a combined income of over 80K a year, and yes we live in suburbia in a newer home and drive newer automobiles. But, drugs affected the lives of the parents and long story short, we his grandparents, ended up here at this place today when we should be planning our retirement.I would have liked to see more interaction, ideas, solutions, and support integrated into this documentary rather than the hopelessness that it portrayed."
3,A simple Guide,"Although this book is a result of an intense research and insights, this book is just good. I will have on my library for eventual consultations."
5,Macrobiotic/whole food Bible,This is a truly comprehensive guide to the macrobiotic way of eating. One friend refers to it as 'the bible'. The entire back half is devoted to helping certain health disorders.
3,The Macrobiotic Path to Total Health,"I know nothing about this book. It was requested and purchased as a gift.The service from Amazon was good, as usual."
1,Limited Options,"The careers suggested by the author were limited and unimaginative. Pass on it, there are much better career books out there for both romantic and creative types!"
3,Better than nothing but.....,"I was so exited when I found this online, guess I should have paid more attention to the deminsions. It is way too small for any shopping cart I have used and leaves a great deal uncovered. This defeats the purpose since I bought this so my son would not be putting his hands and mouth on the germy shopping cart bars or handles.It does, however work great on resteraunt high chairs. So for that aspect I think it was worth the purchase."
1,Out Dated,Seemed like a good idea but these days it hardly fits over any of the grocery carts or high chairs at restaurants. So now it sits in my car fading in the sun. Save your money.
1,Truly doesn't serve its purpose.,"So...I bought this for our 7 month old. What a nightmare. What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE. It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen. And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end. Forget the bar cover. It is just as narrow. This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING. To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support. My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed. The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.Just bad. Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart!"
1,"good concept, but lousy product",I had trouble keeping my 7 month old in the cart seat. I saw many good reviews on this product so I decided to try it. BAD idea! My daughter still slips around in the cart. It is very expensive for a small piece of fabric and very bulky too to carry everywhere with you. I took it back and got my money back.
2,"Nice try, but doesn't cut it.","I was so happy to get this since i was tired of my son slipping and being so uncomfortable in shopping carts. Also, I was getting grossed out by him chewing on the bars. Well, it only took one time using it to realize it was a waste of money. While it held him in place fairly well, at least better than without it, the covering was useless. Most of the cart was still left exposed for him to put his mouth on and the padding isn't very large. If all i was interested in was him staying secure in the cart, then this would probably be OK. But with babies there are other issues like comfort, cleanliness, and ease of use. I returned it right away and a week later discovered ""The Floppy Seat"". What a lifesaver that has turned out to be. So much better. It covers the entire seat and is padded nicely. It also is very secure. Babies r us just started carrying them. It costs twice as much as the secure me, but it's worth it."
2,BETTER PRODUCTS OUT THERE,"This seat doesn't cover the whole grocery cart and doesn't seem to be very comfortable. It is also not easy to place in the cart while holding your baby. I recently bought a similar seat by infantino called Shop & Play. There is a removeable pillow for the back of the cart which my daughter loves-I'm sure those carts can get uncomfortable after awhile. It covers the whole back and handle of the cart with leg holes that have flaps for babies legs to rest on. There are three toys which are over the handle to entertain baby and easy to roll up while holding baby. I bought it at Wal-Mart for just a little more than this seat, but well worth it for the extras."
4,Good product,I bought this seat when my son was five months and was still having a little problems with sitting up and the belt on this helped him sit up in the shopping carts and i didnt have to worry about him chewing on the shopping car bar. My only complant is what about the sides of the cart.
1,Product is good but the seller's headline is misguiding,"I have just bought these gloves and was under the impression that you were getting a ""Set of two"" pairs since no one buys gloves for a single hand. Also, since the product photographs shown here reflect that this is an older product as compared to what is available on CLC's website, I think it is a rip off for this price.Someone please educate the seller that a set of two (in gloves) means two pairs and not one right and one left..."
2,Not what I expected...,"As a graphic artist, this book was a book about templates, and personally I have created and seen much better work than was featured here. This is the last book I buy from Mr. Green."
2,Good for one reading; but not for reference,"This book is good to browse through and get tips on. However, after one or two readings, the book can basically be ""discarded"". This book is not worth buying. It's worth reading at a bookstore, but that's about it."
1,I decided to return the minute I opened the cover...,"I'm sure this book would be helpful to people with out-dated computer software. It is basically a book of templates. Almost all current desktop publishing programs come with a wide variety of useful templates. The book was useless to me. I'm sure to other people it would be helpful, but definitely not for anyone with an ounce of experience in design."
1,Disappointing,"I'd hoped I was investing in a useful book, esp. since one of the authors (Ismail) has coedited a book with Carver Mead. The material lacks conceptual clarity. It appears more like a compilation of material - a ""cut and paste"" effort by people who are strangers to analog circuits. I've met Terri Fiez at a conference - she was charming, but it was clear that she did not have a clean grasp of what she claimed was her area of expertise. Perhaps it was too much to expect Ismail to save this book ...."
1,A let down,The shoes arrived with multiple scuff marks on both sides of the shoes as if they had been sandwiched in a tight spot that caused a significant rub mark on the outer portion of the soles (where the little toe resides). Very disappointed to pay this much for a shoe and then receive them damaged. Of course would like to get a better pair because I used to really love Johnson and Murphy shoes but now I will never buy another one again.
1,Do you want a ROCK STIFF shoe? This is it!,"Style and size are right. If you're looking for a very nice, ROCK STIFF, very uncomfortable pair of shoes, that will leave your feet in pain every day, this is it. If you don't want having to think about your feet or shoes during the day in a painful and regretfull manner, do not chose them and go to something else."
5,Breathtaking,"I just bought this pair of J and M. They are breathtaking. I went to a fancy wedding tonight and everyone was complementing my shoes. Buy them. They are beautiful. You will never regret it. J & M make a fine, fine product."
2,Poor Quality,"Stay away from this shoe. I purchased a pair of these J&M Meltons and within a month both of the heels starting flaking/shedding off. (I only wore the shoes a few times each week). Thankfully, Macys took them back and I exchanged them for a real pair of shoes from Allen Edmonds. Save yourself the trouble and go up a step in shoe quality to Allen Edmonds, Alden, Brooks Brothers, etc."
1,Buy a used pair of AE Park aves,"After owning a pair of park avenues, you will not be able to wear these.The leather on these shoes are made from corrected grain. Therefore, because of the treating process, the leather is left stiff.Go on ebay and buy a pair of Allen Edmonds Park Avenue's. They are the same style shoe but are of much better quality. They should last you 10-15 years."
5,Oxfords,"Great shoes to look at, and very comfortable, and solid. I would certainly reccomend them to anyone that has a desire for a solid high quality shoe that feels good for walking."
4,Feels pretty good out of the box,"I bought these shoes because I wanted a decent quality shoe, but I also didn't want to pay an enormous sum. I paid $109, whereas the shoes are listed at $175 in the J and M catalogue. I only have to wear this type of shoe once or twice a week. At the same time, I wanted something that would be suitable for meetings with lawyers and courtroom testimony.I've had them for a very short period of time, but I'm pleased with them. They came quickly and were consistent with the advertisements and information about them. Though they are pretty stiff out of the box, they are not uncomfortable, which is a pleasant surprise. And they look great!"
5,Dress Work shoes,"If you absolutely have to wear dress shoes with your suit to work, these are a must. I work in retail and standing, bending and walking all day in these have never given me a problem. They are comfortable yet still sharp and dressy."
4,Good shoes,"As expected. Many previous Johnston & Murphy shoes, always meet expectations. Dignified, understated and well made. Not as immediately comfortable as higher priced Italian brands but equally comfortable after some wearing and much longer lasting / better value."
4,High Quality Shoe,"Impressive quality workmanship. Full leather sole is stiff and requires a break in period to get that ""old shoe"" feel. Fully lined."
3,Never had so much trouble trying to lace up a pair of shoes!,"Not sure why they sewed the tongue of the shoe to one side of the shoe near the holes. It made it VERY VERY difficult to lace the shoes up. What would take about 1 minute to complete took a good 5-10 minutes as I tried to squeeze my fingers into those cramped spaces, getting finger prints and smudges all over the shiny shoes. I dread when I have to relace the shoes when the laces break. The leathers are very stiff but with the help of a shoe horn, I was able to slip my feet in. I guess the break in period will be longer than my Bostonians..."
4,Great Shoe,"These shoes run about a size smaller than most shoes, but I knew that from trying them on in a store. They can be tight at first but will break in well after a few wears. I purchased the 9D but wonder if i should have got the 9E. Overall, happy with the purchase, and definitely the price for it is cheaper at amazon than anywhere else."
5,Still a good pair of shoes,"I have another pair of these that's 10 years old. I've resoled them several times and they still hold up. Although my new ones were made in India (rather than the USA like my old pair), the quality appears to be the same. These take a few days to break in, wearing lightweight socks helps make the process less painful. Sizing is true to size. I think these shoes are a solid value that should last for many years with proper care."
2,"Great looking dress shoe, but its the most uncomfortable pair of shoe I have ever owned!",I will not recommend this product! It looks really good and sharp until I wore it for a high profile event for the 1st time! My feet was hurting every step I took.
3,The shoe is OK,Pretty good the heel slips a little. They take a while to break in and hurt your feet at first.
3,"Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny, Volume 1 (Indiana Jones)",I expected more from this book when paying about $20 for it. The subject is a great one to write on but putting this book in this format and in 3 volumes is a little bit too much. Just make one book out of it at a descent price please.
2,Not detailed enough.,Only gave me basic information I could find in a user forum. Definately not worth the price.
5,"Meaningful lyrics, powerful voice.","I stumbled across this CD and was very thankful that I did. These songs have helped me through an extremely rough time by helping me focus on the positive things in my life. Richard has a powerful voice, yet soothing, and the lyrics are very meaningful. I look forward to hearing more of Richard Follett. Thanks, Richard!"
1,Dictionary for Dummies,"I thought this was a great idea - a portable dictionary so that you don't have to get up to look up a word while you're reading. The problem? As far as I can tell, it only has words that are already pretty common. Some of the words we looked up that it didn't have include gelid & eidetic - okay, those aren't exactly easy words. Some others, though, like merlot, were surprisingly not there. It became a quest to find words that the thing DID have. We came up with one: onomotapoeia, and then gave up. I think this would probably be a great gift for a young reader, but for most avid adult readers (there were 4 of us), it just doesn't cut it."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This product held so much promise but failed to deliver. 50,000 words might seem like a lot but the really tough words, the ones you really want to know the meaning of, are not in this dictionary. Also, one must spell the word they want the definition for nearly perfectly to get any definition at all. Even if the word is spelled perfectly, if that word is not in this dictionary, it will give you the meaning of any other word that has some of the letters in the word you want to know. I think that the idea is great, the gadget is easy to use and it makes a good bookmark however, it is a poor dictionary due to its very limited vocabulary."
1,horrific device!,"i doubt this dictionary would have the word 'horrific'. wouldn't you think that the designer of a bookmark dictionary would realize that the market would be bookworms, that is, folks who have no need for every day words and a yen, an insatiable itch for that word just beyond reach? this was, therefore, one of the most frustrating purchases i have ever made, and i was frankly relieved when it failed to survive a rainstorm. by the by, one would also think that it would have survived a little rain. unless you have the vocabulary of an eight year old and the patience of a saint (and live in a desert) do not buy this product."
2,So-So,"This is a handy device but seems to have a fairly limited vocabulary in storage. I'm guessing that I don't find at least one-third of the words I look up in its dictionary. If I had it to do over again, I probably would not purchase this product.Update: Having had this for several years I can tell you that it is frustrating how many words are not in its dictionary. Also, the ""I"" has been problematic for quite some time -- sometimes it works OK; sometimes not at all. Don't waste your money."
5,Beautiful Puzzle,"What an awesome puzzle, it is really beautiful. It is a bit tedious with all of the snow but I think that's what makes it such a beautiful puzzle, I will be buying a frame and hanging mine on the wall., I wish there were more 1000 piece horse puzzles to choose from. I am a horselover and we do have our own with all kinds of pictures on the walls. A must have for any horselover/puzzler person. I would recommend for any adult with patience but not children."
4,Good Overview of Concepts,"The book delivers what it promises: a very succinct overview of Contracts law. I found it immensely helpful in understanding major themes in Contracts, and the book addresses many of the most popular cases found in the casebooks. My one complaint is that Prof. Chirelstien is sometimes a bit verbose at times. It often appears as if he looses sight of his audience (law students primarily) and tries to impress his colleagues in academia with his vocabulary and academic wittiness. I can get that in class from my own professors. That said, I think the book a very helpful guide to law students who are still fuzzy about the concepts after reading the casebook and going to lecture."
5,Short and sweet,"This is a very readable introduction to contracts. It is quite short, and I used it to give myself some basic familiarity in advance of beginning the class."
3,"Dense, too few examples","I got this book as a supplement to my coming law classes. In general the concepts are very well explained and the many explained examples are helpful. However, I wish there were some examples provided that were not explained and allowed the reader to work through them on his/her own."
1,Unhappy with book,"The book was not in ""good"" condition as promised. The book was literally falling apart and had a strong smell."
1,OK...But not for a law students,"This book was ok. It won't help the 1L law students looking for an aid to help them supplement their readings. This book is just a glorified canned case book. Highly recommended for those CONSIDERING law school and want to read about contracts BEFORE they start school. Once your in law school, look for another source."
2,Wireless a good idea?...... maybe not.,"This system is a piece of cake to install. Two people make it easier and faster. Make sure you have electrical outlets at both locations where the monitor and camera will go. Then, FIRST take the camera and set it in the area where you will later mount it. Then set up the monitor where you want it. Good picture? Congratulations! Poor picture? Try adjusting the antennas on each device to hopefully achieve good reception. (Poor reception will have rolling lines through it.) Still poor reception? Box it up, send it back, and buy a wired system. Perhaps the First Alert brand. It worked well for me."
5,That's 70's Show,These short episodes are just great when you want to view something and don't have 1 1/2 hours to watch a regular movie. I sure hope there is a 70's Show Season 8..Actually I own all 1-7 seasons
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I still enjoy watching this show and will certainly buy this set for my collection, but I should say that this season is by far not the best. For anyone who is new to the show: buy either season 1,2 or 3. Those episodes were hilarious!After having been on the air for so many years, one just can't expect That '70s Show to still have fresh ideas all the time.The plotlines really are less interesting and significant this time around. All of the characters are grown up now and they lack the on-screen chemistry they used to have.However- It is still worth purchasing, for the fans, because it's the last season with the entire cast still intact before Eric and Kelso leave in Season 8."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS EVER!!,"That 70s Show is quite possibly one of the greatest sitcoms fox ever produced. Season 7 is just another hilarious ventures into the 70s. Donna dyes her hai blonde and looks finer than ever and she and Eric are past the whole lets get married phase and the gang is back to their old antics and new ones. This probably should have been the last season, but the show was still very strong with plenty of laughs."
4,A decent season,This is a good season. Some of the episodes were very funny and bringing back chong and was a good move for the show. This should have been the last season though. There is no way that the remaining characters could have continued the show on their own. It would have been a different story if they added some strong characters but bringing in randy was a mistake. I think this is the season where Wilmer(Fez) starts to lose his ability to deliver lines.
4,"A delightful, intensely musical mix","To paint his own masterpiece, Bucky Baxter used a heavy palette of bright and vivid color. And he filled a big canvas.A longtime sideman for Bob Dylan, Steve Earle and others, Baxter finally got down to recording his own album last year. The result of his labors, Most Likely No Problem, is a delightful, intensely musical mix of instrumental tunes that embraces and celebrates practically all known styles of music.There are bits of gospel, pop, blues, rock, jazz, reggae, country and swing, and one tune was even written as a score for an imaginary cartoon.Some of the selections are tributes to other musicians; all pay tribute to the power and importance of music itself. While there are no lyrics, Baxter has lots to say, and he states it gracefully. He's surrounded himself with able musicians here, but it's Baxter's tasty, persistent steel playing (lap steel, pedal steel and dobro) that unifies the record and provides its ultimate appeal."
5,Great book / Small print,"I bought this book and the soup bible. Both books were written by Debra Mayhew, however this print is very small. Bear that in mind when ordering this book. I prefer the soup bible over the soup encyclopedia because of the large print. Almost identical books!"
1,Terrible,"Bought this item as ""new"" for $50. Received it in a manilla envelope, no packing. Opened it. corners were crushed, scratches on the front and was clearly not new. There was a sticker on the back that said, ""List price, 14.95"". Have had to file a dispute with Amazon. The seller is incredibly rude and unapologetic."
4,Great Amplifier Switch,"This amplifier switch enables multiplexing of two amplifiers to a single pair of speakers, and I suppose that it could be connected as well to switch one amplifier to two pairs of speakers. I have opened the enclosure to verify that it consists of merely a four-pole double-throw switch on a circuit board. Given the simplicity of the contained switch and circuit board, this device appears to be over priced. However, it would not be possible to build such a device oneself at much lower cost, and the end result would not be as compact and nicely finished. A minor complaint is that this device accepts up to 14-gauge wire, but not 12-gauge wire, which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. In reality, however, this amplifier switch does what it claims to do, and does it well."
4,Some of the grooviest music you never heard,"Money Mark's first album is an introduction of a talented member of a band (Beastie Boys) doing his ""own thing."" I can't really describe it as being one genre. Mark did many things on this album, it's half instrumental, and half pop and blues songs. I like the whole album, but I skip through the songs depending on the mood I'm in. It's a gem in my collection of over 300 cd's. If you're just totally into Beastie Boys, you'll probably not like this album, but if you have an open mind for blues, old school groove, and instumentals, you might find this is an album worth adding to your collection."
5,Quick Service and Quality Product,"I received this product within seven days after order, at an APO address and during the annual Christmas rush. Speak volumes for Amazon.com and Cables to Go. A good combination of customer service and price. The cables' timely arrival averted a loss of system usage between computers and Smart Boards at our school. Indeed, the teachers had nothing but high praise for our quick response and materials acquisition. This is all thanks to Cables to Go and Amazon.com."
1,Be Warned!!,"When I bought this item, the remote wasn't working but an email to the company soon had one winging it's way in the mail to me. However, after a few days the dvd player itself stopped working and all subsequent emails were ignored. I ended up having to get a refund through Amazon. The dvd player went into a dumpster. It was a shame because when it worked it was real easy to play any region dvd's. It's quality is more than reflected in the cheap price though."
3,It would be nice if it was available...,"I spent hours doing research on different options to play my international DVDs, and finally settled on this one given that most reviews were promising. The player can (apparently) only be purchased from one company, and after giving them my card info, I got an email from Amazon saying that unfortunately this seller cannot take payments from Amazon at the moment. This was very frustrating and a waste of my time. Why they list companies that cannot work through Amazon is a mystery to me. I recommend you contact Amazon and the seller before attempting to purchase it... the whole experience felt fishy to me."
1,Defective item,"This device seemed fine when it arrived. However, it stopped working after about 3 months. We have tried to reach the seller various times, but are not getting a respond. Thus, we are stuck with a defective player and completely wasted our money."
4,"A very good compilation, but not enough","This is one compilation from the ""Noise Records"" years. I think Rage have too much ""best of"" songs to put in only one album, and also I think this album has some songs not very important to an album like this. Where is Wasteland, She, or the Accept cover Fast as a Shark?. It's a good album but not enough. Like the Trapped! album.... enough is enough."
4,BURN THE FACE OF GOD!,"Well, this is certainly brutal! This isn't quite as good as ""Diabolical Conquest"" or ""Onward To Golgatha"", but this album still destroys, nonetheless! I've only heard this once, though, I'm pretty sure I'll be listening to this piece of barbaric death metal once again! I can't really remember the hight lights than I was going to say, oh well, there's always next time! Also check out Centurian's latest CD on FMP, and Burning Inside!"
4,Easy to use,"I was looking for virus software for my Dell Axim X50 and came across this item, because there were no reviews I went to the Airscanner web site to find out more info, while there I found out that you only have to pay for it if you are a professional/ business (ie: not for personal use), if it is for private use you can down load the full version for free. The installation was a snap and the program is easy to use and has no adverse effects on my operating speed or any other programs. I'm very happy with the anti virus sofrware, I recommend for anyone looking for PDA protection."
3,shining stars no more...,"My daughter received this as a gift, however, when I went to register a month or so ago, the website posted a message that more stars were being added and would have to check back later. When I went back again today, the message changed stating that Russ Berrie filed for bankruptcy on April 26 2011 and so the website (www.shiningstars.com) associated with it is no longer maintained...The toy is cute, but if you are purchasing in order to have a star named after a child, you will be disappointed."
2,Do not buy!!!,The company that makes these went out of business and so you can no longer register your star! That was the purpose of giviing this to my daughter on her first birthday....so disappointed because we had gotten one for our son a few years ago so he has his star named for him but now she won't. Wish I would have known before spending money!
5,Great gift idea,"This cute cuddly shining star plush toy makes a great gift for little ones. I've not had any problems with the website. Naming a star after herself was a great self-esteem boost for the recipient. As always, Russ offers a quality stuffed toy. Very soft, very cute, beans in the feet to give it a good feel. This unicorn also have some glittery hair that this little adored. Highly recommended for children."
4,toy,My grand daughter asked for this as a Christmas present and loves it. But now she has to fight off her two sisters and bother!
3,Pretty much what I expected,"The unicorn is a little smaller than I expected it to be, but it is very soft and plush like advertised. The naming a star is kinda cool (although, how can we really be sure how many have named the same star...). Overall, it's a cute unicorn and makes a nice gift for the unicorn loving child."
1,NOT a WEBKINZ,"I am upset because I wanted to purchase a Webkinz unicorn and this came up as a webkinz brand because it is tagged as such with Amazon. It is not Webkinz! It is Russ brand. You can go online with this in a manner similar to Webkinz but only on the Russ website. Cute unicorn, but not the one that my daughter had requested. I have also had difficulty returning to Amazon because although they managed to send me this request for a review, they don't seem to be able to find a record of my purchase so I can return it. Sign me very disappointed in Amazon for this one!"
2,NOT VEGETARIAN,"As one other reviewer already did, I would like to point out that these are NOT vegetarian- they contain gelatin."
5,Best gummy bears period!,"I love these gummy bears. They put me into a sugar coma though, so I try to only eat them every once in a while, but you can't beat the fruity flavor and gummy consistency. My favorite flavors are the Red and White. Soo full of flavor and yummy. Great deal on Amazon for these, based on what you pay in stores!"
5,LOVE,"My husband absolutely LOVES his Haribo Gummi Bears. No other brand will do. These always arrive fresh and quickly from Amazon, and are a far better value per bag then any other store in our area. I highly recommend this product."
1,Stale and hard,"These gummy bears are indeed original Haribo candy but it is made in and shipped from Turkey (yes, Turkey). I am not sure how long it takes to get to the US but the candy is unusually hard and stale. You may want to stick to the ones you buy at a local supermarket. I have had much better luck (albeit 30 or 40% more expensive) with the same product from a local Walmart. Your mileage may vary of course."
3,Love Gummies! But These Aren't the Best,"I am a big fan of gummy bears, but these Haribo Gold Bears are just your average gummies. Black Forest gummy bears are much more flavorful in my opintion. With these Haribos I sometimes can't tell which color I'm eating."
1,***Beware VEGAN/Kosher Eaters!!!***,"THIS PRODUCT AND OTHER HARIBO PRODUCTS ARE NOT NOT NOT KOSHER!!!!! THEY ARE NOT NOT NOT VEGAN!!! THEY CONTAIN PORK GELETIN!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR PORK-COLLOGEN-FREE CANDIES OR ANIMAL PRODUCT-FREE CANDIES, SEARCH FOR VEGAN GUMMIES AND MAKE SURE YOU VISIT THE PRODUCT WEBSITE AND READ YOUR LABELS PEOPLE!!!"
2,Haribo,"as a real german person ( and sorry for my englis, but i try my best ) i have to say these gummy bears taste not like the gummy bears back here in Germany. i come to the US twice a year and the one year i was a bit ""homesick"", so i bought a bag of my fave german gummy bears. what can i say, the taste was like the original but actually not, even the colors aren`t right. my american friend loves the gummy bears from Germany, so i carry every 6months 30bags into the US. if you love the american version, fine, but if you ever have the chance to get a bag from Germany, try the ""original"", much better."
1,Not even close to the original...,"I am German but have lived in the United States for almost 13 years now. It truly pains me to see what Haribo has decided to sell here in the US under the ""Gold-Bears"" brand. Anyone who has ever tasted the real thing will know immediately how fake these are - by simply looking at them!You can tell right away that their German tagline ""No artificial flavors or colors"" does NOT apply here.Imported from Turkey? If you're going to ship all the way from over there, why not give the American consumer something worthwhile...?"
2,American version,These are the American version NOT the European version. Too damn gooey and sweet. The euro version has a firmer texture with more flavor and less sugar. These are disgusting in comparison.
1,bad for heatlh - corn syrup - no original haribo,"I'm totally disapointed by HARIBO and by the american product - produced in Turkey. They called it original and its not, because they use the corn syrup in the Haribo for the Americans. I'm German living in the US and ordered it for my 2 year old daughter. But I'm totally disapointed. They dont use fructose or syrup made out of fruits. The corn syrup goes into the lever of our kids and turns into fet. Its a grazy thing what Haribo does and I throw all the Gummibärchen into the trash. Its not ORIGINAL Its against kids and its not a sweet in somehow a good way - its a sweet in a very bad american way where people are used for the experiements of food industry and there profit."
3,"Kids favorite, but Im not so impressed","My kid is absolutely crazy about Haribos, this is the only candy/chocolate I dont share her passion with.For starters it is a bit too rubbery and chewy. Agreed it has flavor, but the flavor has be fought for by chewing really hard,I Prefer something that would not be so rubbery. but again, individual tastes differ.The good part is it comes in those mini packs, really handy when travelling out with kids, I usually keep few of these in my bag for ""emergency"" tantrum situations.. comes in handy. Afterall kids love it, so overall they r ok I guessAlso this is not overly sweet or anything, just lightly infact"
5,Gummi Bears win but Amazon loses,"I recently ordered 2 boxes of Gummi Bears as a gift for a friend for Valentines Day.They arrived and she was surprised and happy. Unfortunately somewhere in Amazon's shipping chain someone cut open one of the boxes and stole one of the packages. An Amazon sticker was places over the intruders opening to attempt to cover up the theft. I reported this to Amazon but I received no response.I had previously only ordered books from Amazon and never had a problem, always received what I ordered in good condition and well packed.What really ticks me off is that they did not respond when I reported the theft.Peter"
4,Fresh Voice on a Fresh Subject,"Calloway takes us into a world few of us knew existed, much less knew in detail. She uses writing talent and a fresh voice to bring insight into a fresh subject matter, something that is much needed in today's book world. A great read and a good value, this one is well worth the money!"
5,love it!,"I loved it! Its a beautiful color! I didn't have any issues with the smell. It kind of smelled like a pool float at the beginning, but now its gone."
5,Love the colors!,"Like the majority of commentors here, I agree with the distinct factory odor that the mat carries. However, that is a minor tweek to the mat. I love the colors of this ocean print, and it helps to stir notions of relaxation and concentration. It's very comfortable under my body, and it's quite affordable under my budget. It's a great investment for the determined yoga-er!"
1,Slippery,"I bought this mat after reading all the good reviews. Washed it with a little soap and air-dried for a week to get rid of the smell. On my first use, I was sliding every time on downward dog and on standing poses. So much so I had to change to the gym's mat in order to continue with the class. I am disappointed with this purchase."
3,Sorely dissapointed,"While I really like the length, color, and thickness of the this mat that's where the good qualities end. This mat is slippery. Not something you want when it comes to a yoga mat. I don't know what coating this company puts on their mats or why but they might as well have coated them in butter. I washed it off in the shower first to try and make it sticker, and when that didn't work, I washed it in the washing machine and put it thru 2 rinse cycles to try and get whatever coating off, but to no avail. I bought this so I wouldn't have to use the stinky, used, unclean ones at the gym, and to use at home. I used it for one class, and slid so bad, I had to go back to using the gym's to avoid injury. Keep your money or send it to someone else."
2,Slipperiest mat I've ever used,"I have been practicing Iyengar yoga 1-3 times per week for 4 years; my practice is intermediate to advanced. I received this mat recently as a gift, and tried it out yesterday for the first time.The surface of the mat has a coating on it (probably the antimicrobial coating) that makes the surface dangerously slippery. I was unable to hold standing poses without ending up in the splits and attempts at Adho Mukha Shvanasana slowly slid me onto my face. This is not standard for my yoga practice. I attempted valiantly for 10 minutes, and then gave up and switched to a borrowed studio mat.One positive is that the thickness was nice, and standing on my knees was well padded and unpainful using this mat."
4,"Great Mat! Don't be afraid of the ""smell""","I really like this mat! It's not only pretty, but is very soft and comfortable, and is a good length (I'm 5'9""). It does have a slight smell when you first take it out of the box, but it went away after a day. The other reviews grossly exaggerate the extent of the smell, I didn't even have to wash mine. I use this mat for pilates, and my hands did occasionally slip a little bit but that would probably more of an issue for those who do yoga. The minor slipping is the only reason it got 4/5 stars."
2,"Cool design, but not so great","I was very excited about this yoga mat because the design/colors were so cool, but in the end I disappointed with it. Despite reviews of its being sticky, I found my feet sliding during my yoga sessions. In the end, I returned the mat for a longer, thinner, cheaper yoga mat."
4,"Good value, looks good","I like using this yoga mat; it's a pretty color and design, has a firm, somewhat sticky surface that is excellent for standing poses and also is thick enough to cushion knees and elbows. I find the standard length and width o.k. for my practice, but some might want to purchase one of the larger ones offered.I think the material should stand up better than some of the softer mats I've used. It's one of the less expensive mats on this site, but is listed for more on the manufacturer's site. Overall, I think this is an excellent, reasonably priced mat for both beginners and more advanced yoga students."
2,Very slippery - impossible to remedy,"Has an oily residue that I thought I could remove, but nothing seems to take it off. I tried vinegar & water, straight vinegar, lemon juice, dish detergent & water. My hands still slide out from under me in down dog. I do not recommend this mat. The thickness is what I was looking for, but it won't work for yoga."
4,Great mat but does come with funny smell,"This mat is great but it does come with a funny chemical odor when it's first out of the package. I scrubbed mine with just hot water and soap and let it set outside flat for a couple of days to air out. That worked fine. The other thing that's nice about this mat is it seems the more you use it, the more pliable it becomes. Gorgeous color too."
3,would have returned it if I hadn't of opened it.,"I was set on this mat since it was the same brand the yoga studio uses that I go to. The tapas mat is different in class. This ultra mat is thick and pretty, but does not give me the non-siipperiness that I need. My hands still slide in downward dog."
3,"Not as described, but quality mat","This mat arrived promptly, and while it had a smell, what do you want for a giant sheet of plastic? My chief complaint was the color is not what is pictured - mine was almost solid green. I wanted a yoga mat that was different than everyone elses!!!! It was also very short - I had assumed (perhaps wrongly) that 68"" was the standard size my yoga studio stocked (I am 5'9"" and this was about 5 inches too short to full stretch out for cobra). However, that being said, the 1/4"" was nice and cushy, and very sticky (I did try it out at home before returning for about 5 minutes). I returned, and re-ordered an 80"" burgundy ultra hugger mugger tapas in the 1/4"" thick. Great brand, I was just looking for longer, and a different color than the average joe."
1,I wanted to love it ... but I couldn't!,"I bought this mat because of the wonderful reviews it received. It sounded perfect! Thick enough to protect my knees and head, sticky enough for my hands and feet to stay in place and oh-so-pretty!But it just wasn't sticky. AT ALL. I've never had this problem before so imagine my surprise when I was slipping in down dog. And in various warrior positions. My gosh, it was so distracting!So while this is such a beautiful mat, I am returning it because it isn't doing its job :("
2,no arch support,"Ouch! My aching feet. These shoes arrived today, and they wore out their welcome in fifteen minutes. They are flat inside, with no arch at all. Quality of construction seems adequate, but I'm going to have to cram some aftermarket arch supports in these things or my tootsies are gonna be squealing in pain."
3,Good,"This is the first time I've read a Bobbi Smith book and I liked it. Elise's story was good but it didn't get real exciting until the end of the book, I wanted to turn the pages. It was a good story and I liked the characters. I would recommend it as a good read and I will read the other ""Brides"" stories."
2,Bad tranfer of good flick,"There's nothing really outstanding about this vintage martial arts film, although, Chia Ling does make an imposing heroine in a standard revenge tale. The real story is the terrible transfer. Tai Seng should be ashamed to not at least panned and scanned their dark 3rd generation print."
3,A good introduction to the Cyprus question,"This is a well written, vigorously argued book on how Cyprus came to be divided. Hitchens makes his case with passion and conviction in a style that is enjoyable to read.Naturally, this is a very partisan book. My own feeling is that Hitchens has magnified the roles of outside powers at the expense of analyzing the roles played by the Cypriots themselves. There is a visceral New Left animus toward Washington's role here that may obscure the extent to which this conflict was home-grown.Nonetheless, this is a strong book and a good introduction to the Cyprus issue."
4,itty bitty book light 2,this is a great thing to have it comes with a battery case but I purchased the power pack ..it works for me.i do not use the battery pack it is big and outwieghs the light..i would recommend the one that has the battery pack in with the light...i have that one too and I love both of them.Very handy light. As i do my cryptograms in bed while my husband is sleeping.
4,Necessary,"If you use your booklights much, you will eventually need one of these. Watch out that your adapter has plenty of air space around it; they tend to overheat without it. If you see any signs of distortion in the outer cover, replace your adapter immediately; you don't want to risk a fire.Don't buy it here without first checking on the cost from the manufacturer."
4,good product,only problem i have with it...is that the plug doesn't go all the way into the power supply..which seems a little bit unsafebut works great
1,not usable,"This AC adapter does not come with a cord, so cannot be used. It was a waste of time to order it and now have to return and reorder a different one."
4,night reader,"so far the booklight is great. it is my fourth one. the cables are very sensitive, but it is still the best reading light at night."
3,A long wait is over,"Anyone who spent anytime at all listening to F.M. radio in the sixties will remember the slinky soul instrumental CAN I DEDICATE and Linda Tillery's gritty version of GOD BLESS THE CHILD. The rest is good to hear again, but it's pretty standard BAY AREA sixties soul/rock. For those of us with fond memories of KMPX and KSAN,the high water marks on this CD will take us on a very cool journey back to a time when chances were taken by both the players and the listeners."
4,Good Beginning,"Sue Grafton's early books with Kinsey are very good. Believe it or not - they start to get REALLY good later in the alphabet! This book starts off with a missing person, then evolves into arson, burglary and murder!"
3,Maybe Kinsey is like a mold. She slowly grows on you.,"This book had it's moments yet they were few and far between. I enjoyed getting to know Kinsey better (as most reader's will) but I found that the novel lacked interesting characters for Kinsey to hang out with. It is not a waste of time, but you won't go recommending it to your local clergyman."
4,Missing Widow,"'B' IS FOR BURGLAR is second of Sue Grafton's Alphabet Mysteries and it seals our fate as readers--we will keep reading.Kinsey's hopes for a fast case to give her bank account a much need infusion of life. How hard is it to find a widow who lets the world know she's around by wearing a $12,000 fur coat? The lady would stand out in a crowd.But murder is on Kinsey's plate when Elaine Boldt's bridge partner turns up dead, the coat appears, but is minus Elaine.One of the best series around.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
3,Fun reading - great distraction,"I find Grafton books to be wonderful distractions while going through a hard time, i.e. recovering from surgery, illness, having family problems, etc. I bought this one to give to a friend who needs fun, easy, distracting reading. Great diversion. Not literature!"
4,"Complex plot, well delivered read","Sue Grafton is a consummate professional. Her storyline and characters well developed, believable and delivered with excellent writing skill."
4,"Fun, quick read","A very compelling tale of missing persons, burglary, murder and investigation. Grafton's heroine is genuine, flawed, courageous, and relatable. This series is a must-read!"
3,B is for Burglar Review,"So I just finished B is for Burglar by Sue Grafton. It is the second book in the series and the second one I have read...obviously. It was a lot better reading this one compared to the first because I knew how the writing in the goes. I love Kinsey Millhone, she is a great investigator and I would definitely hire her to find a person for me. The suspense in the book kept me awake far past my bedtime, I couldn't set the book down because I wanted to find how what new information Kinsey would find out from her suspects. The end of the book definitely caught me off guard, I wouldn't have guessed that the guilty person was who it was. Sue Grafton knows how to write a book in a way that doesn't give to much away, and the reader is able make their own investigation while reading the book. I would recommend this book to readers who love suspense and a good crime novel."
4,"""B"" is for Burglar.","The book is great. However the proofreader did not do so well. Sue Grafton is an excellent mystery writer and I'm looking forward to reading ""C""."
2,B is for Boring....,"I just started the series and simply tore through ""A"". Unfortunately, ""B"" left me crying ""get to the point already!"" It was very drawn out, lots of details that didn't add anything but pages to the book. I think the plot was good, had it been more condensed I think ""B"" would be a great book to read. This simply took forever to finish and sadly has challenged my interest to read the rest of the series. All the other reviews seem to really celebrate the writing. I just couldn't find myself engaged with this book. Maybe I'll come back to the series after a short break."
4,A Good Murder Mystery,"As the second installment in Ms. Grafton's alphabet series the character of Kinsey Millhone is a bit more developed.The book is better than the first, ""A is for Alibi."" While not a great mystery, it's a good solid read. Ms. Grafton is developing her main characters well. She also has a bit of a talent for the use of metaphors in her tales.The book is not as good as her later ones in the series. The climax of the story comes & goes very quickly at the end. Yet, it's still an enjoyable mystery."
3,'B' is for Burglar,"The second novel in Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series, 'B' is for Burglar is a great improvement over the first book. Kinsey is hired to find the estranged sister of her client, but when the disappearance suggests murder her client balks and stops the investigation. The missing woman's elderly neighbor, however, becomes delightfully involved in the investigation, and rehires Kinsey to find out once and forever what happened to Mrs. Boldt.The flow of 'B' is for Burglar is more natural than the first book, although Grafton still wanders away from her original story from time to time. The book itself is dated by fashion (and a typewriter!), but in another few years these details will be charming instead of strange."
5,I'm now a Grafton addict,"She's been writing for years but I've only read the first three but Grafton is wonderful. This book is just another example. An edge of your seat mystery thriller, the twists and turns keep you guessing while the first person accounts by Millhone make you feel like she's your best friend. If you want a wonderful quick read, pick up this -- or any other Grafton book."
4,When print can be just too small.....................,"Great story, winner of private eye writers Shamus award. 5 star. Lousy presentation - take off a star. The type in this edition of the book is just too, too small. Really denigrates the reading experience. Publisher, Bantam, was too concerned about the number of pages being printed it seems. Check out other editions before buying this one, you'll regret it if you don't. I know I do."
3,"Good, but shouldn't be award-winning material","I like the Sue Grafton series. I got hooked with A and have been working my way through the alphabet ever since. However, this is my least favorite to date. In most ways, it's just like her other work, only this one had a gaping logical hole at the end of the book, which will kill even the best-written novel."
4,Good read!,Nice series for anyone that wants a decent mystery series to read at work or during down times.
1,errors in it.,"Thankfully I did not purchase this book. I borrowed it from the public library. At least I didn't waste money on it. On Page 219, first paragraph, she says she left the keys in the ignition and got out of the car. On Page 224, first paragraph, she says she became aware of a hard knot pressing into my thigh. Car keys. I just couldn't keep up on all the characters, there were so many, Lily, Marty, Beverly, Elaine, Tillie, Pat Usher, Mrs. Ochsner. I think the author should go for more character development, less on so many characters, and less on scenery development. I do think the alphabet mysteries are pretty good but this one needed editing as described above. Still better than some of the mysteries out there by other authors."
3,I just wish I could care a little more for Kinsey,"I am an inveterate mystery writer and Sue Grafton's books are mysteries and they are well plotted, but, I really have a hard time caring much about Kinsey Malone, her heroine.I have read about the first five books in the series now, and i will continue to read them, but they are not high on my list because I want to be involved with and care about the heroine (or hero) and Kinsey is too remote to care that much about."
2,Not worth the read,"I've read another of Sue Grafton's novels, and just like the previous one, this did nothing for me. Between the plot, the characterization, the writing style, there's nothing about it that stands out as being anything above mediocre. In this novel, Kinsey goes looking for an eccentric wealthy woman. This leads her to Florida and a woman posing as the missing woman. The red herrings were weak. The villain was not very believable and the story was a bit dull. This isn't worth the read.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
4,Entertaining and fun,"Grafton continues to develop and expand on Kinsey's character with the second book in her series. Its been less than 2 weeks since the events of ""'A' is For Alibi"", when Kinsey is approached by a new client, who needs her to locate her missing sister, so she can recieve her portion of a late relatives estate. When Kinsey cant find any evidence that points to where the sister has dissapeared to, she suggests going to the police, and her client promply fires her, but she continues to persue the case anyway. Grafton deftly takes us through many twists and turns on the way to solving the mystery, which once again culmunates in Kinsey nearly getting herself killed.A very well told story, that keeps the reader interested, but is very similar to the first book in the series. Kinsey continues to grow and develop throughout this book, and I can't wait to see what happenes to her next"
4,Better than A,The second in Sue Grafton's alphabet series really helps the series pick up speed. This one takes Kinsey from California to Boca Raton Florida and back.
3,It was ok,"The plot is very clear, but I feel that I missed a lot by listening to the abridged version. For example, I never really ""got into"" the characters. The book consists of 2 tapes and its over before you know it. If you can afford the investment in the complete set of tapes, it is probably worth it.The read, Judy Kaye, is easy to understand and portrays the characters much more vivadly than I could in my head!"
3,Not a bad light read!,Not the brainest of books. Light hearted. Decent plot etc. Enjoyable! Nice to have a female lead for a change.
5,B is for burglar,"Excellent story easy to read, Susan Graftton's way of writing is easy to understand. If you follow her stories you get the feeling you know her well."
1,Simplistic,"As another reviewer has said: Too many names, no identities. Completely unbelievable (the police, apparently, are morons) and not well written. I was hoping for better and now am not sure I want to investigate the alphabet any further."
4,B is for Burglar,"This is my second book of hers to read and am loving it just as I did the first. I have become a fan and can't wait to get to the next book. Each read is different from the last except the main characters remain the same as with any series. You do not have to read the books in any kind of order and still can know the main characters with a new mystery. I'm sure it's better to read them order, but I've not had any problem whatsoever. Whatever book you read first introduces you to the people and just go from mystery to mystery after that read. Hope you enjoy these easy read books as much as I am."
4,Involving and enjoyable,"After enjoying ""A is for Alibi"" so much I was a little worried that the rest of Sue Grafton's series would be lackluster and dull, but if this sequel is any indication the rest should be just as good! If anything, ""B is for Burglar"" is superior to its predecessor. While enjoyable, Alibi was a tad too predictable - I knew exactly who the killer was the moment they first showed up. Not so with Burglar. I was still guessing right up to the end, which made it a lot more suspensefull to read. The case in this one is also more difficult since no one really knows the truth about what happened (is Elaine really missing? If not where is she? If she is, is she still alive or has she been killed?). I would highly reccomend this to anyone who likes mysteries, and I can't wait to continue following Kinsey's adventures!"
4,It kept me interested.,I was interested in the story so much that it only took me one day to read it. I couldn't put it down. I could hardly wait for the end. The only problem I had with the book is the ending is kind of jumbled. It's hard to figure out who is doing what to whom. All in all I think her books are great and I have all of them except O.
3,"Double Your Pleasure, Double Your Aggravation","This pamphlet shows a lot of hard work went into the research of Ace double science fiction books, however there are a few errors in the data such as The Stars are Ours by Andre Norton/Three Paces of Time by Sam Merwin, Jr. is listed as Ace D-119. It is actually Ace D-121. There are nice cross reference lists at the end of the book; cross referencing by author and by title. However, I found that they are not complete. When looking up a few titles I found the titles were not in the list, but are in the main text. I don't think it is worth the $6.95 being asked for it, but being the only one of its kind out there one does not have a choice."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I read a review of this chart by Alison Weir, herself a confirmed authority on British royal genealogy. It was a disappointment. The chart is neither comprehensive nor expansive. It maps only the major members of the ruling houses, saying nothing of their more complex relationships to one another (Henry VIII was related to all 6 of his wives in the degree of 4th or 5th cousin, depending on which line is traced—this is not even suggested on Taute's chart). She doesn't even include birth dates. For the casual historian or someone needing a basic reference this has its uses but it's nothing spectacular save for the extensive lines of the ancient Welsh, Celt, and Scots tribal kings.Also the chart is highly outdated. If you want anything referring to H.M. the Queen's (quite large) living family, this has not been updated since before the birth of Prince Harry. Yikes!"
2,Browne is down for the count,"I really like Jackson Browne and I have all of his albums, but I'm disappointed in this release. It seems Browne has lost it, and if he doesn't come up with better material for the next one I think he should consider call it a day. ""The naked ride home"" and ""The night inside me"" are pretty good tunes, but most of the rest on this album feels so uninspired.Compared to songs like ""Doctor my eyes"", ""Rock me on the water"", ""Take it easy"", ""Ready or not"", ""Tender is the night"", ""For America"", ""Two of me , two of you"" among others the material on the album falls rather flat.If you haven't already bought Tom Petty's ""The last DJ"", I think that would be a better album to to spend your money on."
1,Jackson Browne is truly running on empty,"As a loyal Jackson Browne fan who has waited six long years for a new album, I was very disappointed with this collection of duds.I often wonder why it is that so many artists seem to write songs of great depth and beauty when they are seemingly too young to have such complex insights and experience; and then, after years of learning life's lessons in love and loss, seem to come up with only shallow platitudes. I don't get it.The first song and the last couple of songs on this album are okay. Other than that I would say skip this one and buy yourself new copies of the four that I consider to be his master works: For Everyman, Late for the Sky, Pretender, and I'm alive."
3,A rejoinder?,"I agree with many comments on these pages that Jackson Browne's 'The Naked Ride Home' doesn't rise to the heights of his earlier releases. The music lacks freshness and blends too many disparate elements. But, at their best, the songs and the poetry are great. For me, the CD is indispensable for the title track alone. Compare and contrast the song with Joni Mitchell's song Night Ride Home in the light of her criticisms of him in recent times. Browne's song is altogether more intelligent and poignant than many on these pages have been prepared to acknowledge when it is interpreted against this backdrop. Intended or not, the contrast between the calm, togetherness, joy and privacy of the relationship in Joni's song, and the turbulence, disintegration, loneliness and public exposure of the relationship in Jackson's song is very pointed. It might be drawing a long bow, but seen in this context, the song has been a long time coming."
2,Long time fan says buy something else first,"A pretty good album, which is as bad as it gets for Jackson.Buy Late For The Sky or Lives In The Balance. Even the dated and overrated Running On Empty is more pleasing than this."
1,"A Pale Ghost , Copy Protected","I have been a follower of Jackson Browne's music for 30 years, and have never been so disappointed in his work. Self-conscious, hectoring tripe. None of the vitality of Lawyer's in Love nor the Depth of image and feeling of the Everyman period. As someone who plays all of my music from digital libraries, the copy protection was also annoying. If I pay for a copy I expect my fair use rights to be respected. Until Electra/Asylum reverses their policy on copy protection and issues refunds or replacement copies of these crippled goods to affected users, their label is off of my buy list."
2,Disappointment,"I have been listening to Jacksons music for more than 17 years now. I have got each of his 13 albums. I love his music and I admire him for his ability to write unique lyrics and melodys.What made Jackson so special to me was the combination of his wonderful melodys and his extraordinary lyrics, something I didnt know before I bought my first album ""Hold Out"" in 86 on a fleamarket.But... where are the beautiful melodies on ""The naked ride home""? Where is the beautiful sound which he expressed over three decades? I am deeply disappointed.Do you agree? Do you have a complete different point of view?

2,Questionable,"You can pick and choose what you like from this book. Some of the advice ranges from ""look good to attract a man"" (as opposed to ""look good because it makes YOU feel good"")to practical budgetary advice. I found myself shocked at some of the 1950's style advice, but enlightened by some of the stories told. The advice seems overall pretty basic...not necessarily aimed at a single woman who has been out in the world awhile."
1,Latte for one and loving it.,"This title is deceptive. It's not ""Latte for one and loving it"" - it's more like ""Latte for one while you find a man"". The first four chapters deal with dating. The tone of the book is that you're not complete with a man, that getting married is the ultimate goal, and that this book will help until you achieve that goal. But if you're single and want to be happy being single, this book will be depressing."
4,Great book and the life of Joseph,"This is a great book with great insights on the life of Joseph! I recommend this book to anyone who teaches, ministers or preaches the Word of God! I have a few books on my list of books to read...if that weren't the case of me I would read this book over again!"
5,Encouraging,"We found this book to be very encouraging and inspiriing. God's message to us is that we should wait and allow Him to vidicate us. That message is the source of great strength and patience, and we are grateful for having read this wonderful book."
5,What is more American than S.O.S. pads :),"Lets face it, it is just a steel wool pad imbedded with secret soap stuff, but heck these pads work, on dang near anything and at this price for this many you can't beat it, the same super soap pad most of us grew-up with is still around (unlike Twinkies) so stop wasting money on ""New and Improved"" and use a trusted and fun product."
2,Disappointing sound,"Very disappointed of the sound. When I buy a pricey Blu-Ray disc from Opus Arte I expect exceptional sound quality. That is not the case with this disc. Regrettably anything else from the production to the singers becomes kind of irrelevant without good sound. The overture started very good. The orchestra is vibrant and with full sound. But once the singers appear you start looking for the sound, looking for anything wrong with the audio systems. The problem is the disc itself. What a pity! (please see comments for updates)"
3,Singers' Undressing,"Don Giovanni [Blu-ray]Excellent performances, and stage settings.The real turnoff for me was the stars stripping - DG baring his chest, and he and others taking off their shoes. Why did they do that?I am staying with my Glyndebourne version."
2,Good but fell apart...,"I love this book and I have nothing negative to say about the images, the text, the quality of the illustrations... except that my book fell apart very rapidly. I own a lot of art books and handle them constantly, but this never happened to another book before. The book binding is just glue (no thread) and the pages (all single) started to come off after a few months. Now my book looks like a folder with loose pages. What a shame...I love my book."
2,Nutranail Cuticle Remover,It doesn't seem to work well. I think it was a waste of one's money. I wouldn't purchase it again.
2,This didn't do anything,"I'm not very familiar with cuticle removers, but I was expecting it to remove the excess cuticle at the base of my nail. It did nothing of the sort. At best it softened it, so that I could use my cuticle cutter, but I could've just soaked it in water and achieved the same results."
4,It's Okay for the Price!!!!,"This product cleans your cuticles. It's a good value for the price. However, I probably need something stronger cause it only lasted two days so I guess I have really dry cuticles."
5,A Miracle!,The BEST of the BEST products out there. You will not believe how powerful this little thing is. You don't have to wait for a min or so with struggling to remove your cuticle btw I used to use Creative Nail Design Cuticle Away Cuticle Remover 6 oz. no chance at all to stand to 30 second remover. The cuticle are being threatened by this they will just go XD
4,Great cuticle remover,Decided to start doing my own manicures/pedicures versus having them done at a salon. This cuticle remover works pretty well and makes my manicures and pedicures much easier; with better results. I presoak before applying which seems to do the trick
5,Beautiful music for both young and old!,I originally bought this to add to our baby music collection. My son loves it but we also love the beautiful adaptions and acoustic arrangements. I even played this cd during a party at our house and got great feedback. I definitely recommend this cd to help your little one's mind grow and to add some relaxing tunes to your day!
1,Poor Guitar Playing,"The guitar playing on this album is very amateur. Lots of string noise as the left hand shifts. An immense amount of extraneous noise from the fingernails on the right hand. A tinny and metallic tone. Poor fingerings, such that notes from the previous chord bleed over. Tempos taken much too slow on various pieces (I've never heard Fur Elise taken at such a snail's pace). Occasionally, the arrangements themselves are very poorly done.If you want to hear real classical guitar music, most or all of the pieces are recorded elsewhere by competent classical guitarists. Check out the albums of Christopher Parkening, David Russell, Manuel Barrueco, or John Williams."
5,creepy...I can't get parts out of my head,"The book is very well thought out. In a couple places it seems a bit too quick and easy (like escaping froma prison bud through a vent in the ceiling), but 99 % is well told. Just the facts alone about what this country would go through after four bomb targets...forget a fullscale war. It's scary: the famine, the outbrakes of disease, the nation splitting up... read it! You won't regret the time it takes(I finished it in two days)"
2,Detailed but so demanding!,I found the text to be frustrating at times as I kept losing my place in the maze of variations. More is definitely not better. It was almost as if we had had access to his notebook computer files where variation upon variation had been patched in over the years.The author is a highly respected French defence exponent. Perhaps it showed my own shortcomings and is more suited to 2000+ rated players.
3,Another re-master screw-up.,"While it is great they remastered it.Though not much of a difference, I bought it for that and the bonus tracks. I found on Disc 2 during the song ""Turbo Lover"" it's mixed or mastered wrong. It sounds terrible.The bonus tracks were recorded during a different tour. Does Columbia think Judas fans are stupid? Id reccomend saving some money and buying the orginial one issued on cd a while back. the guy who supervised and Re-mastered this whole project should not be in buisness. Most of the remasters have some flaws or another. None the less this is a good album of them live."
2,Sony lying to the fans...yet again!,"Don't get me wrong...I am a HUGE Judas Priest fan. The 2 stars are really a rating for the record company, who have bastardized this fine library of work from the get-go. The 3 ""bonus"" tracks on this album were NOT ""recorded during the Fuel For Life tour""; Screaming For Vengeance was recorded from Memphis in 1982 and the other two were recorded during the Defenders Of The Faith Tour in 1984 from Long Beach, CA. How do I know? I have (STILL) both of these concerts on cassette tape when they were originally broadcast on radio and I know these recordings by heart. Does the record label think we all are stupid fans who will part with their money just because it says ""remastered""? I know I feel stupid because I did...and I am STILL waiting for Sony to fix the Defenders Of The Faith remaster screw-up of reversing the channels, like they promised me they would. I bet Michael Jackson's back catalog didn't have these problems."
4,Solid Live album of Priest's 80's material,"Priest Live is a good release and includes most of the bands best songs from the 80's. I know a lot of people are down on this album as they consider it the Turbo era release and point towards the flashy costumes and big hair the band sported for this tour. However, the playing is fantastic. The vocals incredible and there are many songs from British Steel, Screaming For Vengence, and Defenders of the Faith to rock out to. Also, I always liked Turbo more then most other Priest fans and the opening with Out In The Cold was to me unique and brilliant as Priest showed they didn't follow the mold for bands of its genre and era and had the balls to open a show with a Ballad."
4,Halford is god!,"I love this album for the pure power of the Metal God's voice. It was taken off the ""Turbo Lover"" tour, and the tracks ""Rock you all around the World"", and ""Private Property"" get the crowd riled up, and screaming the chorus back to Rob. But my absolute favorite Priest song is ""Some Heads are Gonna Roll"", and Halford screams the song out like no other. Only Bruce Dickenson can come close as far as screaming ability, and one only hopes that Halford and the boys patch things up, and give their fans a final world tour with the true Priest, and not ""Steel Dragon"". Rob Halford may be a bit strange, but as far as being a Metal singer, he is the very best out there, and to his hardcore fans he is was and will always be the true ""Metal God""."
3,It's Priest and it's ok!!,"All I'm going to say is it sounds clean, a little to clean. The song choices are ok and nothing more. Theirs not much interaction with the crowd and at times it does not sound like a live show. Halford's Halford, which mean he's God like when it comes to laying down some amazing vocals. The twin guitar attack is clean and heavy and the solo's are good. The bass is present but almost subsonic at times. Dave holland's drumming is well, Dave Holland's drumming, yawn!! Overall it's a pretty decent cd as it provides a good perspective of what Priest was about at that time, however if you really want to hear Priest live in their glory, get Unleashed In The East!!"
3,Priest...Live,"You can expect to find some ""Turbo"" songs on here along with some ""Defenders of the Faith"" songs. If you don't like ""Turbo"" then you won't like this album. I got this to complete the Remster series. The sound on this is really good. I agree with others that ""Unleashed in the East"" is better. I've heard Rob sing better live than on this cd. His voice breaks up with the higher notes and sounds off key at times. Maybe I'm just too fussy, but I don't like the way Rob sings on this album. I like the DVD ""Electric Eye"" much more than ""Priest...Live"". It's nice to hear some ""Defenders of the Faith"" songs, but kinda disappointed."
4,I was just listening to this,"After seeing the band live at the OC Fair on 8/5/09 and what caught my interest was that that it had the song 'Out in the Cold' (very good song) from the Turbo album but it's also included as the first song on the DVD release of the Dallas Show from the Fuel For Life Tour and I couldn't help but being fasinated by it especially with the way it was sung. The video needed some work due to the limitations of video back then and I disliked the way that the guy that was filming would place images of the crowd over the performers while singing and the DVD has that 80's imagery to it but it was still a fantastic show, not as good as the current one though especially after seeing them live on 8/5/09."
3,too many filler songs,"There's too many unsatisfactory tunes here to make this the definitive double-live Priest album. Quite simply, such an album hasn't been recorded. Unleashed in the East comes close, though.I prefer the choice of material on the Live in London recording, but that was made with Ripper Owens. He did his best, but he's not Rob Halford.Now that Priest have reunited with Rob Halford, there's no doubt another live album in the future."
4,Better than Live After Death!,"This is the best live album of the '80s. What brings the rating down is that the three bonus tracks are tacked on the end. I would have preferred if the entire album was kept on one disc even if it meant no room for extra tracks. I like that there are no songs that were already on Unleashed in the East. It would have been nice if they squeezed on one more song from Point of Entry. This has the definitive version of Living after midnight. Turbo Lover doesn't work that well live, so they should have cut that and included an older song that wasn't on Unleashed."
1,Uh.....THIS SUCKS!!!!!,I have ALWAYS thought this album was terrible...and guess what...I STILL DO!!! I strongly recommend 'Live '98 Meltdown or Live in London over this weakling of an album....in the words of Beavis and Butthead....UHHHHHHH.....THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!! Maybe if I click on the album cover and press delete enough times it will go away for good!!!!!
4,International Winner,"This is another winner in the Baby's First Series. It's a terrific combination of songs and beats from around the world. It's an especially cool CD for quiet time activities. My kids (4 and 2) and my students (5th graders) love this CD. Don't let the ""Baby"" in the title keep you away from this series. It is terrific music and SO AFFORDABLE! The price is unbelievable for what you get. I've sent many CDs in the series to friend with kids of all ages. The Guitar and Fairy Tales CDs are especially well done and enthusiastically received by moms and dads and kids alike!"
3,Oh my! Dirty song! Dirty song!,"They say ""marijuana"" on here! That's all you need to know! These people are obviously terrorists! They're murderous drug fiends! They want to destroy America! Run! Hide!Hey but at least the cockroach isn't shaking her fake boobies and thrusting her pierced belly button in your face, eh?But anyhow, never ever share your marijuana with a baby. They are total bogarts."
4,a favorite Ian Hunter film,"Bette is always great, but I particularly enjoyed Mr Hunter. Only recently discovered this actor and the wealth of 1930's movies he was featured in. Also a good performance by Colin Clive who is nothing like Dr. Frankenstein here."
2,"Some good info, but sloppy and poorly organized","This is the text for an editing course I am taking. There is a lot of solid information in this book, and the exercises will push you to apply what you've learned. But the way it is presented and organized is driving me nuts. You can't tell where exercises end and text begins, and it's difficult to relate the various sections because of poor page layout. There are also inconsistencies in terminology and use of editing marks and just general sloppiness. Seems to have been written by someone who knows their stuff, but fired this book off on their home PC over a couple of weekends without much thought to organization and layout, then printed the pages on a photocopier. Oh, and didn't bother to edit it very carefully."
4,"Put it on your shelf, writers","After reading the entire book, I'd say the most useful feature are the checklists found at the back of each chapter.They often listed things I would forget, and that, right there, is more valuable than anything."
2,Pretty is as pretty's made,"This item is very attractive--BUT--it's made out of pressed PAPER, with just a coat of paint on the outside.. Very hard to put together with no directions. Had it 90% together, just needed to tighten screws (very difficult, because they couldn't get a grip on the paper), when I stepped away to answer the phone--and the whole thing fell apart, the screws on the bottom ripped through the paper and the paint, damaging both the inside and the outside of the wall. There's no way to repair it, because it just crumbled. I got it together, using the glue that's included to hopefully hold it together, although it's still a little shakey, but have no doubt that it won't hold up to the steamy bathroom. Very disappointing. It's a nice design, looks great, if they had only made it from sturdier materials. Also, there is NO drawer, as stated in the description. Overall, not worth a fraction of the price."
1,Don't waste your time!,"It came pre-cut from the manufacturer and the pieces were cut wrong. We ended up sending the item back, as as it is a manufacturing issue, there was no point re-ordering."
1,"Biggest piece of crap, ever.","Received this. Opened it. No step-by-step instructions. Needed several different sized phillips head screw drivers. Did not have the correct parts--had 2 upper door hinges, no lower door hinge.If it would have been a simple item to return at that point, we would have done so."
4,A Falcon's Eye View,"This little book by Dans and Harrell is a charming introduction to the city of Baltimore, as seen through the eyse of a young Peregrine Falcon. Endangered peregrines first returned to nesting in cities in Baltimore in the 1980's after nearly going extinct in the United States - garnering international attention. Dans skillfully weaves the birth and first year activities of a baby peregrine in with the marvelous history and architecture to be seen in downtown Baltimore. The combination of natural history and scenic Baltimore is very appealing. Kim Harrell's illustrations provide a keen perspective on the falcon's view of a beautiful city."
2,Pretty much a rehash of other documentation,"I was disappointed that there seems to be little new work included here, especially in the initial section documenting already deciphered languages. The section on Linear B almost seems like plagerism when read side by side with Chadwick's book.I would rather more complete presentations be done on the undeciphered scripts and less on those that have been deciphered (after all, that is the title).This book may be a good introduction for those who have not read the related individual accounts are are just looking for a very high overview of decipherment, but any true amateur researcher should shy away from it."
3,Barry Fell Deserves A Better Deal,"Holy Olio's review (10/27/02)of Robinson's Lost Languages says that he is encouraged that the author mentioned Barry Fell without dismissing him or disrespecting him. I would say, however,that the Robinson statement on the first page of his concluding chapter comes close to being a dismissal: ""A Harvard University professor in zoology, Barry Fell, was convinced that he had deciphered rongorongo and the Phaistos disc before he died a few years ago, though his extensive published papers were very far from scientific in their method."" It is to be hoped that Julian Fell's biography of his father, Barry,""Biography of a Renaissance Man"" will eventually be published in book form. Part 2 of the biography, ""Barry Fell's Revolution in Deciphering Old World Scripts"" appears in the Summer 2001 issue of 21st Century Science & Technology. ..."
1,NOT UNIVERSAL STEPS,The steps look great.They do not fit my vehicle though.I ordered them for a 2008 toyota tacoma.I dont think i can make them fit even with a few brackets.I will never buy anything from go-rhino again!
1,not what pictured,The step received looks nothing like the picture. It is a black tube with a narrow silver plate instead of black with a rubber grip covering.
4,Just for relaxing and lounging around,"That is exactly what this CD is for. Great Jazzy beats, and smooth tones introduce you a world of relaxation and chill."
3,The title needs to be changed,"I bought this to play for my younger children (age2) because the title says ""babies"" but some of the stories are definitely not for younger children. These are the original stories with no editing. (ie.. in little red riding hood the hunter takes a gun shoots the wolf and then takes a knife and cuts his stomach open to let grandma out). The story telling is very graphic. Some of the stories are fine though and we put those on a tape for them to listen to."
1,Sound really terrible,"I having hard time trying to listen to some of the stories. And there no ""break"" in between each story, like a music or anything to indicate next story. I won't recommend this."
4,"I would highly recommend, certainly if you've read Chris Hedges ""Death of the Liberal Class""","If you've heard Chris Hedges speak or read his most recent book, he starts with the Creel Commission in 1917 also called the Committee on Public Information (CPI). Noam Chomsky references it in one of his recent books too. This is written from the perspective of an educational historian, and continues C. Wright Mills theme around a mass society. Well worth the time, to gain the historical foundation of the origin, perspectives, and actors of US propaganda. Interesting that resisting Fascism was a big part of the rationale, given our current circumstances."
2,For Computer-phobes,"If you are afraid of computers and have never used Quicken before, this is the book for you. You will also find this book useful if you want to see what Quicken looks like before you buy the product. The book provides pictures of all the screens and repeats the descriptions that Quicken provides. If, however, you are passingly familiar with Quicken or are brave enough to click on things and read the help, you will not find much of use in this book. If you want a better understanding of how to organize and use Quicken, pick another source."
3,Taiko Project (and others though),"I had high expectations for this DVD, so perhaps it's unfair to say I was disappointed, because there are some really great parts, but there are some not so good parts as well. For variety of styles, extra material and video quality it is good, but the ability of some of the performers is not too impressive and less than half of the disk is performed by Taiko Project! So the twirls and high speed tricks they do were really limited to a couple of songs. Even Omiyage was performed by other groups! Still worth it though."
2,Outside appeared great!,"The book jacket, book cover, and pages were in great condition but the minute I opened the book, the binding started cracking. I was going to give the gift as a Christmas present.....now I'm not!"
4,Great Song,"This contageous song can be played in my cd player all day. It has a punchy bass line, catchy organs, the sexy lyrics, and an alien sounding voice singing. Certainly a ground breaking song. I am disapointed in the sound of the remixes. I feel that they are stale. I love hearing them, because you can make out some of the voices more but over all i really dislike these remixes. For a ground breaking song, a ground breaking remix would have fit much better. These remixes sound very 1993.I also wish the slightly altered in sound video version was on here.But get in your car and BLAST the Radio Edit out of your stereo and you will feel it pump through your veins."
3,Mixed,"ROXANNE is a wonderful script/film. How could Martin go wrong adapting and putting a spin on one of the great classic plays (""Cyrano De Bergerac"")? But L A STORY shows Martin is weak when originating a long narrative. It's really a quite terrible script/film. In fact--while I saw ROXANNE 3 times--I walked out of L A STORY half-way through."
5,Read it twice,"Mainly because I had to retake the course, but it is actually a really good book. Details the history of the Far East back to the Sage Kings and all the way up through the 1980s. Well written, well organized."
3,Black and white text books can cure insomnia,"I had this book for a US - East Asian affairs class at my local community college. It was a decent text book and contains tons of information about Asian history and the emergence of Asian nations as strongpoints in the Pacific.Each page of the book is separated into two columns which means that you have to read each page twice. Also, the whole book including all the pictures is in black and white. When reading about the extensive Chinese dynasties, these combined factors can make the casual reader very drowsy."
1,Junk,Don't waste your money on this trash. Little better than no glove at all. Already falling apart at seams after wearing 3 TIMES!!!!!
3,Not bad had better,had better cheaper gloves. ordered them and not long after i have holes in them already.
5,This is the same collection as The Complete Upsetter Singles,"This collection of singles from 1969 is a stunner. This collection contains A & B-sides--the first 50 ""Upsetter"" releases Perry put out through Trojan Records in the UK. Particularly shocking is that this collection represents less than 1/4 of his singles output over 3 years. The set contains a pretty thorough booklet that provides not only a ""history"" of Lee Perry, but also information on each of the tracks included in the set. These tracks are pretty upbeat by dub standards. There are some rude songs, a cover of ""hello dolly"" and a real strong 60s soul influence. Lots of harmonies--beautiful stuff."
4,Lennox Furnace Exhaust Venter Blower,The repairman told me this came in a kit ( approximately $400.00). I went online and found this blower that matched my unit. I removed 8 screws 2 electrical connections and one hose clamp then reversed the process. Fired up the furnace and it worked perfectly. have almost a months worth of use out of it.
5,Review by mom of 18 month old boy,"We bought this to use in our son's playroom under his new playset/slide. We wanted it for cushioning and for letter and number recognition as he grows older. He loves it. It is colorful and fun for him to take apart. I know it will serve both cushioning and educational purposes.However, this is not a 62 piece set; it has well over 100 pieces when you count 26 letter blocks, 10 number blocks, 36 edging pieces; and then add again 36 pieces for the numbers and letters because they all pop out of the blocks; plus many squares, like B, D, O, P, Q, and R, have center pieces which come out (for example: two extra pieces for centers of the letter B). The numerous pieces also has me concerned about the smaller parts getting mislaid.I would recommend this product, however, unless the parent is prepared to be picking up and putting together many pieces, I would not recommend it for a child as young as mine."
3,abc mat,i bought this mat for my baby b/c we have hard wood floors and i wanted somewhere soft for her to play. It helped when she would try to sit up and fall over but that is about it. My daughter would take the end pieces off and chew on them then she moved on to pulling all the pieces apart. It was such a pain to keep putting it together and making sure she didn't have foam pieces in her mouth. This product now sits in a closet maybe i will use it again when she gets older for learning her abc's.If you are looking for a soft place for your baby to play I don't recommed this product.
2,Nice concept but our son too young for this toy,"I liked the idea of this toy. I wanted a soft mat for our son to play on and I liked the puzzle factor. It just hasn't been a toy our son is interested in. Maybe when he is older he will put the pieces together, but it seems too difficult for him at this age. He just tears it all apart, and so it is useless as a mat. I end up piecing it all together, which is time consuming, and then he destroys it. I've put it away for when he is older, and I'll try it again then."
1,****POTENTIAL CHOKING HAZARD**,"My child almost choked to death on one of the inserts for one of the letters, even though I was supervising her play. She placed the piece in her mouth lightening fast, it washed into her airway because of excess saliva and then swelled. It took a trauma team to remove it because of the material the puzzle is made from. This toy should be modefied so that none of the letters or numbers contain punchouts-I am in the process of contacting the manufacturer with this recommendation. My kids loved this toy prior to this, but into the garbage it went.UPDATE: 11/2003 The company contacted me in July 2003 to notify me that they would redesign the toy with no inserts. The redesigned model is due out this quarter of 2003."
1,Hours of Fun for Mom and Dad to pick up after toddler wrecks,"Seriously folks, save this toy and give it to someone you don't like! Our two year old, who usually enjoys reading books and quiet play, thinks the game is tearing this puzzle apart. My husband and I spent an hour picking up the pieces from all over the house. In addition, there are small cutouts in the centers of letters like A (triangle), P, R, Q, etc. and these small pieces are apt to get lost. I would say the age for this toy is 6 and older, simply for the parents' peace of mind."
2,Disappointed,"The set is called English Spanish reference set. However, only one of the books is English/Spanish. The other two are English. For the price it is okay if somebody doesn't already have a regular English Dictionary and Thesaurus."
4,Good book!,"I had to buy this book for a class. It has some great ideas for school wide leadership by using teacher leaders. The book correctly points out that administrators come and go, but teachers are usually there for much longer. So it makes more sense for teachers to take more of a leadership role.I would recommend this book.I gave it a 4 because I don't know if there's anything revolutionary about it's approach, but it does make some good points and make us notice things that were in front of us the whole time."
5,Purchase Received,I am so happy to have received my book as promised. Great Service and my book was in GREAT condtion!!THANK YOU!
3,Great Mixing But Some Bad Choices.,"Thunderpuss knows how to move a dance floor. They have done wonderful remixes, However this cd contains 5 songs I really hate. 1) We Are Family (The orginal is much better.)2) The Almighty mix of ""Can't Fight the Moonlight is 10 times better. The last 3 songs should be replaced. Would rather have the words in CLUBLAND. THE ORGINAL MIX OF DIVE IN THE POOL And the Hex Hector mix of Don't let me be the last to Know."
3,Pretty Good,"This album is pretty damn good. I like it quite a bit. However, the only complaint I have is: where the HELL is the Thunderpuss remix of Amber's ""Sexual""? That mix is arguably THE best Thunderpuss mix yet, and they didn't include it on there. Other notable mixes that were missing were ""It's Not Right But It's Okay"" (Whitney Houston), ""Papa's Got A Brand New Pigbag"" (Thunderpuss), and ""Stranger In My House"" (Tamia)."
3,hmmm,"Although i love thunderpuss, i'm not too found of this cd... a Thunderpuss mix comes a live in the full length versions...And Where oh Where is Donna Summer's Love is The Healer... probably their best mix to date!?!"
3,too much of a revved up thing,"too many radio hits here reproduced in a shape radio fans may balk at; also a disappointing sameness in their treatment of so many diva-style soul dances. Dance music needs repetition to keep it rolling, but it needs surprise, changes, and -- why not say it? -- inspiration to give it SOUL. (Yes, SOUL. If one is going to feature soul voices like Suzanne Palmer's and Thea Austin's, one might as well offer the real results... Isn't that what makes voice divas more than just fashionable singing stylists??)"
3,Variable,After a while everything Chris Cox and Barry Harris does sounds the same. Enrique remixed is still not danceable but worth the purchase for Suzanne Palmer - Hide U if nothing else.
2,How can you forget Donna Summer????,"This CD is enjoyable, but they forget to insert at least one of the jobs they did with Donna Summer. I will go with you, Love is the healer or The power of one were absolutely enjoyable mix.I'm so sorry!!!!Bruno Capitelli"
3,Could be fabulous...,"When you think of THUNDERPUSS, you think of fabulousness! For the most part, this CD holds very true to Thunderpuss' diva vocals, harcore beats, and gay club anthems. However, as the CD is winding down, TP2K tends to stray away from all that with a not-so-exquisite remix of ""Dive In the Pool"" by Wayne G. Heaven, and a less satisfactory Britney Spears song, ""Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know"". I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for those two minor...but serious faux pas!"
5,A very good textbook for beginners,"Has very detailed contents. So no need to worry if you are not that good at Math. It has a few examples about how to interpret your model outputs. It was a great help for my homework when I was taking a discrete choice modeling class. Actually, it was the designated text book we used for that class."
2,Difficult to use,"A couple of years ago I bought home design software from Punch software and gave up on it after a few days of trying to figure out how to use it. (And I'm very technical and generally good with new software). I would not recommend this software unless you really have the time to spend figuring it out.Google recently released a FREE home design software. Much like other Google products, this one is very easy to use - although not as powerful as one you might purchase. Before buying, I strongly recommend you check out Google's offering.

3,Can Not Insert Fractions of Inches In Your Dimensions,"Fractions of an inch are not available in any of Punch software packages.So if you are remodeling or designing a kitchen where 1/2 of an inch is critical, keep that in mind."
1,All promises and no delivery,"I have worked as a manager in the construction industry for over thirty years. In my estimation this program is over complicated and under featured.I have struggled with this program for over four months. Windows, tubs, showers, doors and other design items are limited to the internal library. For instance I have a design that needs a four section casement window. Sorry, the library only has one to three sections. You only discover this after a very long and frustrating amount of time reading through a very generic help menu. I want to add a porch with three columns but what I design in the framing menu does not carry over to the floor plan or three dimensional view.This program is all promises and no delivery!"
1,Has anyone at Punch ever built a house!?,"This program is adequate for designing dog houses, but not for the real deal. The most fustrating thing with this program is adding floors (the type you walk on, not a story). Punch seems to think that the second story walls of a building are built directly on top of the first story walls - no Punch, they are built on top of the floor that sits on top of the walls below it. That throws your elevations off by about a foot for each story (assuming 10"" joists and 5/8"" plywood).When you look at the detailed framing view, you can see they have no clue how a house is framed."
5,EXCELENT HOME DESIGN SOFTWARE PACKAGE!,"I WAS USING 3D HOME ARCHITECT 4.0 AND WAS LOOKING FOR A MORE FLEXIBLE / FEATURE RICH SOFTWARE. AFTER CONSIDERING THE UPGRADE TO 3D HOME ARCHITECT 5.0 AND LOOKING AT THE NASTY REVIEWS IT GOT, I SAW A REFERENCE TO PUNCH! SOFTWARE AND WITHOUT A DOUBT I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE WITH THE SERIES 18 PACKAGE. FULL OF FEATURES, VERY FLEXIBLE, CAN CREATE VERY COMPLEX FEATURES WITH THE BUILT-IN 3D WORKSHOP. GREAT INVESTMENT!"
4,Good for the price,"This a great product for the price. It is feature rich and fairly easy to use. The documentation is well done and the videos inside the program are very helpful. There are a few rough spots in the programming. You can tell this product did not come from a huge company like Adobe or Microsoft. If it did, I'm sure it would be three times the price..."
2,Punch Home Design 18,A step above Etch-A-Sketch. Fell way below my needs. Full of bugs. OK product for first time homeowner wanting to tinker around with thier plans.
2,slow program and 3d bugs make it practically unusable,"This is a very frustrating product - it is good in that it has a lot of features, however the major features seem to have bugs that make them almost unusable. Doors and walls disappear in the 3D view unless you ""nudge"" them around so that the program redraws, and even then it doesn't always do it correctly. I have spent more time on this program trying to get it to do what I want it to do, and it is extremely aggravating.I am using Windows XP with a 1.5Mhz Pentium IV processor and 512MB of RAM, so I don't think the speed problem is due to my computer, but just a problem inherent in the product. Viewing Punch's website support forum reveals frustrated users continually running against the limitations or outright flaws of the software.I don't know what other home design software to recommend, but not this one - there's just too many flaws for it to be worth the purchase price."
3,Punch AS18 - no knockout here,"The AS18 is packaged in a beautiful box, one of the best. Perhaps this is a clue. But what's inside (the software) doesn't match the box. It was disappointing to save drawings only to open them again and note that the dimensions changed. Since this happened repeatedly, it was clear that this is an undocumented feature (UDF = bug).So it was time for the patch, which made the system behave far worse and didn't correct the UDF (bug).Worse yet, Amazon only refunded 50% of the purchase price of this software. Yes, that's it - a 50% restocking fee for buggy software.Well, this was not one of my better purchases."
3,difficult to use,"I was really looking forward to using this project. I am a designer without CAD experience. I thought that the guide was difficult to use and confusing. I thought that the program was likewise difficult. I am sure that someone with CAD experience would have no problem using it, but if you knew how to use CAD why would you need a new program? I really would have liked it if they could offer a training course - even an online training tutorial or CD. I have basically given up on using it for any professional application."
1,Punch! Software Lacks the Punch! it promises,"Punch! Software Architectural Series 18 promises to do everything easily and effortlessly but doesn't. Even with the printed manual and the video tutorials, it still leaves you trying to figure out how to make things happen. I am an architect and was looking for a design program I could implement into my business. I will keep drawing the old fashioned way with pencil and paper. This program is absolutely worthless. Don't bother purchasing it. The only ones who could ever use this program are the ones who created it. Save your money."
1,Beware of installation bugs!!,"I purchased AS18, but cannot tell you about the features, because it has a bug KNOWN to Punch! Software, that overwrites some of your WINDOWS SYSTEM FILES when it installs!! If you are running Win 98, 98SE, or ME, you will lose your Internet Explorer browser functionality, that is, IE6 will stop responding to any window that required user input (including the Microsoft Update site, when you try to download critical updates!, an ISP logon that uses a non-80 or 8080 port number, etc.)Rather than issue a patch, Punch support will point you to a microsoft.com technet page that will allow you to fix the problem if you have a few spare hours and a degree in computer programming.I was VERY disappointed with this product!"
3,LetDown,"The software proved ""fair"" at best. Gable roof intersections with unlike pitches give ""unique interior construction"" results but not anything anybody want to build. The window offering include many shapes of fixed pane windows (triangle, round,hex, right right angle triangle) but they didn't include a rectangle or a right angle triangle with different length sides. Deck construction- want some frustration, use this deck construction software. Overall layout tool is good, foundation doesn't supply a foundation depth so on a slope you end up with a floating house (contractors will find that one difficult). I'm not an architect, I do use CAD packages (and will probably fall back on them to design again). Although kids will probably enjoy making houses with this, I won't recommend it for a serious home design or addition design."
1,latent2002,"Many software problems that they could not solve---not for a professional-After months of work on using the program, all was wasted and had to return the software. Printing problems-file conversion problems-half blank screens-it converted and cancelled walls that were exterior converting from interior--Not suggested-lost programs in my computer that the program no longer recognized."
1,not worth it.,"This software is ok, but it's not worth the money. It does a terriable job with roofs (won't calc. rafter and jack sizes on a hip roof). Finding stuff is really hard. I can't find roof vents. Took me forever to get used to the user interface and I'm an advanced pc user. Can't find where you can add an overhand on a roof..... to much to list."
5,Buy or Upgrade NOW!!,"The new punch software package is great! The added and updated features add alot of value. They have also included a bunch of tutorial videos for the users new to punch. It still is as easy to use as previous packages but has added features like a DXF Importer which works rather nicely. I imported a complex CAD drawing and in under a hour I had a complete first floor Punch drawing of punch objects.This new package is expandable, punch has added ""plug-in"" functionality so third party players can add to it. Now if I only new how to program!!I haven't ran into many bugs yet, even if I do punch has started to be better at posting updates on thier site that fixes them."
1,I design software for a living and can't figure this crap out,"This is the worst software I've used in a long time. I design software for a living, so I know good and bad stuff when I see it. This is glitchy, buggy, and just plain crap. Contrary to other reviews, I don't see how being an architect would make it any easier to use. It's just glitchy and non-intuitive with a horrible user interface. I haven't been able to get the 3D viewer to work yet and as previously mentioned, I work with computers for a living. I'm running it on a pretty good machine, not state of the art, but exceeding minimum requirements for the program. There is no reason for it not to work. Every few weeks I give it another shot and just frustrate myself even more. What a waste of money. I highly recommend against this bug-infested mess."
3,Sequels,"These are a double feature pack sequels of the Quentin Tarantino film From Dusk Till Dawn. The title comes from a bar where the movie is set, which is open from dusk till dawn. They are both decent vampire flicks. Quentin is not involved in either film. The third film tells how it all began."
3,"Irritating Menu, Good Stories","Like most of the Thomas DVDs, the stories on this DVD are fun, exciting (for a 2 year old) and full of great moments in Sodor. Really, my son loves to see Thomas shooting by the other engines because of the jet engine and claps when everything ends well.Now, on to why this DVD gets 3 stars instead of 4 or 5-- the menu. Normally, I am pretty patient, you hit the DVD Menu button on the controller and wait a few seconds while it does its little intro dealy so you can choose the ""Play All"" choice. HOWEVER, on THIS DVD, you have to wait through Sir Toppum Hat's speech AND through an explanation of each and every choice on the menu! Seriously-- it IS annoying because there is NOTHING you can do to hurry it through or to bypass it!All in all, if you don't think that would bother you, I really recommend this DVD!"
4,It's hard to put this album in a category...that's a good thing. It's original.,"Bif Nake's Purge does not seem to stick to any genre, neither do any of her other works. Collectively, Bif Naked's sound has amazing similarities to No Doubt's Gwen Stefani as well as similar rock artists such as Good Charlotte. This album certainly explores the genres of alternative, pop, punk, as well as dance. Purge also has a sound consistent to Bif Naked's earlier title I Bificus. Tracks like ""Tango Shoes"" have a very catchy sound, similar to something No Doubt or Good Charlotte would put out. Later into the album, the genre changes however to dance and alternative. Purge probably a stands as one of Bif Naked's strongest titles to date. It's all about originality and versitility, which she does fairly well."
4,A fun walk on the darker side.,"Bif's sophomore album provides us with more fun songs with a dark edge.At first listen this album seems to be quite different from ""I Bificus"", but as you listen to it a little more you find that it's the Bif that we've come to know and love with a slightly different sound. Her songs delve into subjects such as religion, obsession, lost love, and tango shoes. With a mix like that you know you're in for a treat.The first single from the album is ""I Love Myself Today"". It has a rock/hip-hop feel to it that grows on you the more you listen. Then you have ""Stolen Sidewalk""... if you liked ""Lucky"" from her first album then you will love this one. It has the same haunting feel of ""Lucky"", but makes you feel more of the emotion behind the song. After that you have a string of songs that will stick in your head and have you humming at work all day. All in all I would say that there are about 6 or 7 solid songs on this album with the rest filling in quite nicely."
4,Finally!,"I've been waiting for the US release of this album for a really long time now. Every time I drive up to Canada, I considered getting it, but as was the case with her previous release ""I Bificus"" both versions had diffrent songs, and the US version was a LOT better. This time, the two versions are exactly the same. Anyway, it's a pretty good release, despite the absence of any spoken word tracks (like on her self titled debut). I would recomend ""I Bificus"" over this album, mostly because it has much stronger lyrics, but this album has it's strong points, like ""I Love Myself Today"" ""Tango Shoes"" and ""Stolen Sidewalk"". Please support Biffy and BUY THIS ALBUM!!!"
4,An insinuatory and thrilling novel (Party Going).,"WILL SOMEONE PLEASE READ THIS? The best book on Pre-WWII London ever written? Please! Ignore what Burgess said in 99 NOVELS, you can discuss it!Party Going is about the rich and poor, the in-crowd and those who want to be ""in"", all during an all-confounding fog at a train station in London. The writing is a bit confusing at times, but the style matches the substance, and the book works. I only gave it an 8 as it's not longer."
1,Not for me,Could not get into this book at all. Prose to intense and flowery. Took a pass and gave it to a resale shop.
2,"Sorry, John","John Updike is one of my favorite writers, but I found reading Henry Green like reading Upstairs, Downstairs in ultra-slow motion."
1,This novel is like...Ah never mind...It just sucks,Loving is one of the worst novels I have ever read. The dialogue--which other reviewers praised --is too fake and rehearsed to sound in the least natural. All of the characters--including the servants--speak in an overly stuffed scholarly tone that reeks of snobish English professors and equally arrogant students trying to impress them. For God's sake! Can't characters in a novel speak like normal human beings and don't have reviewers regard the novel as trash
1,Cliche-driven doggerel! Yuck!,"I only read ""Loving,"" but let me tell you, that book is the worst. Every fundamental rule of writing is broken is this ""book."" Yuck! I mean, the last line of the book is really ""and they lived happily ever after."" Puh-leeze!"
4,Cat is crazy for these!,They are simple catnip filled mice. My cat goes bonkers for them. He does try to rip them apart.. so I hope he doesn't eat the eyes or anything because they do come off.
3,probably won't be purchasing again,"good: my cats do show some interest in the toys once in a whilebad: when the do play with it and bite down, the toy mice get stuck to their teeth. so they end up having to use their paws to remove the mice harpooned to their teeth."
3,Against review spamming,"Darn it, Nora Navarro, quit spamming your liberal agenda on every fur cat toy review. I happen to be looking for 'real fur' mice and these are NOT real fur. Your canned response is really unhelpful."
3,Serves it's purpose,"Because I have searched high and low for the sink mat I used to use, and was unable to find it anywhere, I purchased this mat. It serves it's purpose which is to protect my sink, but it is definately NOT the same type Rubbermaid used to make. The plastic is ""stiffer"" and doesn't mold to the shape of the sink like the old mat. However, after time I have noticed that the plastic is ""loosening"" up a bit. Why oh why do companies discontine products that are superior, and replace them with inferior types?"
3,disappointing,"Not as good as their old product.I don't know why they changed a classic, basic product.I also bought the sink mats and didn't like them as muchas the original products either."
1,Not a good product!,"I read the reviews and most were not good, but I went ahead and purchased this sink mat anyway. BIG MISTAKE!!! Like most of the buyers said...the mat does not stay on the sink divider. The suction cups are totally useless. What a pain it is to keep putting it back on the sink divider to use it. Shame on Rubbermaid. I am 77 years old and have bought many of their products and have been very happy with them, but this is one of the worse products they have ever made. It sure is not like the ones they made back in my earlier days. They were much heavier, too. I will keep it and use it only because I got tired of putting a towel on the sink divider."
1,Material used has changed,I have bought this product for years from Rubbermaid. Can't find in stores anymore. Ordered on line only to find Rubbermaid changed material they used to make it. The suction cups dont hold and mat will not fold down over sink divider. No better than the garbage I found in stores. Dont recommend anyone spend their money on this. Rubbermaid really needs to rethink this one.
1,Very Poor Sink Protector,"I got this not just to protect my sink but to be able to rest pots and pans on it while I scrub. From just one meal with spaghetti sauce in the wash water, the stains on the divider will not come out. I've tried scrubbing powders, liquids, even straight bleach. Nothing removes the tomato sauce stains. As a desperate move I put it in the dishwasher. Stains didn't budge. Like others said, the suction cups don't work and it slides all over the place. The rubber is just too stiff."
1,I do NOT recommend this!,"I agree with other disappointed reviewers. The suction cups do not hold and within weeks, the rubber stained and the stains do NOT come out, even with chlorine bleach. I am still searching for a divider mat that doesn't stain."
3,"LCD Clock W/Calendar, Displays Date, Time and Temperature (SPECALEN)","It's a nice desk piece for work.The clock works, I suspect the thermometer is a litlle off but it's a pretty piece for cubicle desk"
4,Enjoyable,First time reading this author and I enjoyed this story enough to want to buy Some Like it Wicked and will buy Some Like it Brazen when it comes out.Clara is a beauty but it's her brains that makes her special. Finally a story where the man needs a beautiful woman for her brains and not her money. Clara is kidnaped by Hawksley but he ends up needing her for her logic and ability to think thing through in finding his brother's killer.I was a little disappointed in the ending with the way things were left with family and society. I hope their story continues in Some Like it Brazen.
1,Boderline Moronic,"I have never felt the need to write a review before, and I greatly appreciate those who do as they give me insight on the book at hand.This one is beyond stupid. Most of it was unbeliveable and some of it was absurd. I wish I could give it half a star for trying, but that isn't a choice.The characters were dull and the drama silly. Normally it takes me 2-3 days to breeze thru a book (and I have a toddler)but this one was almost painful to complete. And in fact I didn't even finish the last 3 pages because I couldn't have cared if they made it together or not."
5,Calculus Gilbert Strang,I found the book very comprehensive but a little more hard to understand than I expected because of my current level of mathematical knowledge and skills. Plan to pick it up after I do a bit more preparation. A very good book in very good condition inside. The back spine cover was broken loose but a little Elmers Glue and the book is just like new. A great value for any serious student of calculus.
3,When do you see results?,"I have used the product for 1 month, twice a day. I have noticed very slight results. Somehow, I thought the product would reduce the appearance of fine lines. There are many products that promise reduction of fine lines (wrinkles); I thought this products was different from the rest. I will be patient; perhaps there will be some noticeable changes over a period of time."
2,didnt like it,tried this product for 3 weeks and my skin felt dry and flaky. i am going to try something else now
1,Piece of (expensive) junk,"This thing did not help me one bit. The V2 compression part of the belt would have been OK if the crotch piece was positioned properly to address the typical varicosity. Because it is aligned so it is centered (and not to the right, where most vulvar varicosities occur), it was not applying the most pressure where I needed it. Additionally, since the hip belt is so wide and thick, it dug into my flesh when I sat (and I did have the correct size). Not at all comfortable. And using the word ""discreet"" to describe this product is a lie! Wearing this thing with a bra under your clothes is certainly not discreet unless you're wearing a big sweater!"
3,Meh,"This did take pressure off my pelvic bone, but then my back became just as painful. For the price, it would have been nice to have total support."
3,I do not get it,"I have read several of her novels and this is the last one that I am going to read. The characters are stilted, the feminism is over the top for any time period and the ending did not add up - who the heck was Ismene? I find all of Barbara Michaels' characters very stilted-I sometimes wonder if the author ever had a relationship with a man or with other women for that matter since dialogue and relationships in her novels are stiff and not true to life. Also what was with the scream at the House of Stone - the author never really explained that either. The conclusion was not satisfying - I could not figure out who Ismene was and why she was locked up to die in the House of Stone."
5,Creepy yet funny...,"Others have already gone over the plot, so I'll only add that while this was a creepy novel (especially when as I listened, a real thunderstorm coincided with the one in the book!), it was also spiced with enough moments of humor and interesting plot twists to keep me riveted.The characters - aided by Barbara Rosenblat's expert narration - were rich and diverse, and I'd even enjoy meeting a few of them - like Peggy, the acerbic yet fiesty older friend - in real life.This is only the second book by Barbara Michaels I've listened to, but it encourages me to check out more of her work!"
4,Out of the ordinary,Yet another fablous specimen of fiction from Ms. Michals. A delightful mix of mystery-suspense-romance. If you like this try Elizabeth Peters Amealia Peabody mysterys.
1,Padded Gibberish,"I found this book in the gym, so I took a chance on it. I wasn't expecting great literature, but I was looking for an entertaining and perhaps scary story. What was sent up instead was literary pretensions, unappealing characters and virtually no plot. The feminist stuff was annoying. Karen Holloway was boring and insufferable and not believable. Simon and her friend were a joke. Their patter and forced laughter was without wit. The plot of looking for Ismene in the lost manuscript was ludicrous and the ending was forced and false. This is one of the lousiest books I have ever read. You Barbara Michaels fans can have her. I don't get it."
2,A disappointment,"Enjoying her Amelia Peabody books written as Elizabeth Peters, I was really disappointed by this book. Slow plot, transparent characters and a very whiny unpleasant main character. I gave up half way through the audiobook. Just didn't care and was tired of hearing the character get on an out-of-place feminist soapbox (unless this was placed in 1977 and I missed that). Even in the South, we've advanced farther than anyone in this book."
2,Took effort to finish and I'm a Michaels fan,"This was a re-read--I always had loved the Michaels books as well as her Amanda Peabody books, but man, this was a slog to get through, even though the quotes about women writers were fascinating. It felt dated,even for a book written in 1993, with the over-the-top feminism theme. The main character isn't likeable and her relationships with every other character are awkward and friction-filled. The ghost story is a clunker and the ending unsatisfactory and not really believable. The humorous bits were sort of out of tune with the rest. It was just slow, to boot. I'm an English teacher and am interested in the literary discussions but I can't imagine most other people wanting to read all that. I guess I forgot this was one I didn't like? I've read every book she's written. Give me Ammie Come Home..."
2,Not what was pictured,The item I recieved looks nothing like what is pictured. The towel I recieved is black with a wide satin like section sewn on one edge.
5,Aaron Tippen Stars and Stripes,This is a wonderful tape with many songs and praises sang to us about our country. Aaron Tippen does a wonderful job.Glad I purchased it.Thanks
1,Garden print by Monet,"I purchased this picture as it was shown. It arrived with a totally different frame. I wanted to receive it as it was represented with the frame that was shown in the picture. The frame I received was a modern, gold, plain frame and not the one pictured on the computer. I am very displeased with the frame they sent me."
4,Not as good as other Lonely Planet Guides,"Having used Lonely Planet guides in Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, I expect a fairly high level of quality within the confines of their ""backpacker"" emphasis. I was disappointed in the Ecuador guide; it seems not to be as in-depth or accurate as other Lonely Planet guides. For example, I noticed some street name misspellings--probably not disastrous--open hours incorrect, maps not quite right, etc. Not fatal, but enough to be annoying and to make me question the validity of all the rest of the information presented. (In contrast, the Lonely Planet guides for Chile and Bolivia seemed to be uniformly excellent.) This guide is still quite good--better than most of the competition, although I thought the Ecuador chapter in the South American Handbook (unwieldy to lug around if you are just going to Ecuador) was better and more consistently dependable. I give it four stars ONLY because of the dearth of good competing offerings for Ecuador."
4,Indispensable,"A true guidebook from our favorite travel publisher, we ended up using this book more for its information about Ecuador and its capital city, Quito, than we did for the information on the islands. While I doubt that anyone actually reads a travel guidebook from front to back, what we do like to do with the Lonely Planet guides is to concentrate on the two text sections called ""Facts about the Country"" and ""Facts for the Visitor."" These sections help travelers gain some insight into the place they are about to visit, including cultural clues (for example, it is generally not acceptable to wear shorts in Latin American cities, even if you are on vacation) and suggestions for places to go and things to see.Make sure you get the most recent edition of the guidebook if you plan to use the restaurant recommendations."
2,"Outdated, lacks some good info","Two years after print, I found the LP Ecuador guide to be very outdated. The book was written when the Sucre was the currency of Ecuador, now that they have change to the dollar, all of the prices have increased 20%-40% over what the book says. Also, I found that it lacked information on good, reliable tour operators. I found more reliable tour operators and better prices by doing online searches and by going to the towns and asking around. I believe that a lot has changed in Ecuador since the publication of this 6th addition so I suggest finding a more recently published guide."
1,"Very, very disappointing","This is the biggest disappointment I have had in quite a while. I own this concert in VHS and I bought this to upgrade the video quality. To my own dismay the video quality was the same as the VHS tape; actually worse, because it is 4:3, you can't even make it 16:9. It ought to be illegal to advertise this as BD. Trust me when I tell you: if you expect BlueRay quality (or even DVD quality), then you are certainly buying the wrong product. I could not even finish watching the first song. I took out the BD and played my old VHS, which with the upgrade feature looked better than this disk."
4,"Sure the video is poor, but the sound is great!","I will keep my review simple.Video - I agree with some of the other comments. The video is poor, however as already mentioned it was shot on 16mm film. Plus in someways, between the dodgy fashion and haircuts (of those on stage and off!) it does take you right back to the early 1980's.Sound - The sound is fantastic and in my opinion well worth buying the blu-ray for alone.In short... if you love Dire Straits, buy this release. If you are a ""picture guy"", then perhaps stick with the DVD version. However if you are a ""sound guy"" or just love great music, this blu-ray is for you!"
2,"Poor video quality, not such a great sound quality","This should not be called blue ray, even for the regular DVD the quality is poor. Also 4:3 format is really unexpected. Dire Straits is great, that is why rating is 2, not 1"
4,"very good, but not as exacting as I prefer","Very enjoyable concert with great musicians ! Video was a bit ""grainy"" but not intrusive to the eye. Voice audio was not very discreet on most selections in performance, but Knopfler was never the most distinct enunciator of lyrics ( although most of the bands CD recordings were much more clear). The result came from the record levels at the board, most likely. The instrumentals were much better in record quality , the base was a bit low, but otherwise a very good rendering of the original master with todays technology."
2,looks like vhs,"The picture quality is terrible. I know it's old footage but, Queen Rock Montreal was recorded 2 years prior and the picture quality is amazing. Don't bother with this bluray because it looks like vhs quality transfered to a disc. Sounds good though."
2,Disappointing video quality,"I expected the video quality to be much higher since this is a DVD version with a product description that said ""Restored to pristine high definition visual clarity..."". If you believe that, you will be highly disappointed."
2,Where's the fidelity?,The Audio quality did little to convey a sense of representing the image of the sound stage.
3,Overrated concert...,"This concert has its moments... I saw the group live in 1985 touring after 'Brothers In Arms' was released and that concert was definitely better than this one... also saw them live in 1988 with Eric Clapton.On the debit side, Mark Knopfler's vocals are rather weak at times on 'Alchemy', and he has a tendency to change the lyrics. This version of 'Romeo And Juliet' is a stinker. The best tracks by far are 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love' and most of all 'Telegraph Road'."
2,An overrated concert,"This 1983 concert was not the band at their best. The instrumentals ramble at times in the first half. This version of 'Romeo and Juliet' is a stinker and no match for the studio original. Knopfler's vocals are not up to scratch in some tracks either and in some songs on this video has an annoying habit of changing the lyrics from their original form. Parts of the concert have been edited and it clearly shows.The second half is better though, the strongest tracks by far are 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love' and 'Telegraph Road'. The 'Going Home' theme is good too. I saw the group live in 1986 and they played a much better concert than this one so I say stick to the original studio albums."
1,FAKE - NOT ORIGINALS - ARE SOLD HERE!!!!,"These DVDs are fake. They are delivered in home made packaging. No such product will ever big released from a real studio.As someone who used to manage a music store, I can tell fake vs. original when I see it. The prices are low only due to this fact."
1,Are you sure this was really Dire Straits?,"I was abhorred by this concert. It didn't sound like the Dire Straits songs on their record at all. None of the leads were anywhere close to the originals, and the vocals were not very good. Sucked overall."
5,run time 2 hours and 50 minutes!!! awesome DVD!,"Hi Folks,this just arrived and while Amazon.com claims its run time is 60 minutes its actually 1:30 for the concert another bit for a couple of classic TV appearances and another hour for a very cool documentary which is archival quality not something produced recent...so I feel pretty darned happy for my 12 dollar investment indeed!!Whether I would upgrade to blu-ray is debatable....the picture is not poor but its of its age and not something perhaps benefited by that format...Jump on this one folks!!!"
2,best they could expect from sub-par original recording,"bluntly.....this was the best that could be done with very sub-par recording techniques employed in 1983 to record this concert. pic quality is terrible but remembering it was 1983 explains it. the sound though adequate sounds more likd an average dvd. not at all blu-ray quality. worth owning but not any where near the top of my list more like a curiosity of bad 80's hair and the most rediculous fashion choises I have ever seen in public. sweat bands, sport jackets pushed up to the elbows, even ankle warmers on the drummer. If they paid someone for this type of professional advise I would bet there was a lawsuit. buy the cd and forget the bluray"
4,Whopeee,"Fantastic..... the audio re-mastering is just superb.I have watched this concert on VHS many moons ago. Maybe something like 20 + years. We enjoyed it then, with whatever systems we had.Today I own a much better 2 channel stereo, as I am an addict to music. The audio quality just blew me away.... whew. I have had the audio CD for several years now but the audio on the DVD is just too good. The video quality is a bit disappointing though. They have not managed to improve on the VHS tape. My kids are fascinated by Mark's red boots. They have seen only his rather recent concert DVD's, where he looks prim and proper. :-)Hats off to the re mastering team. Thank you very much."
4,Great Concert with downloadable mp3,"I really like this concert. As already mentioned, the video is not that great but acceptable considering the source. The sound quality is outstanding. I love the fact that this concert is available on the BD in mp3 format. I didn't realize it when I purchased this that in order to get the mp3s you need to have a BD player on your computer.What I would really like seems to be missing from every concert I have bought so far in the BD format. That is - a digital copy that I could transfer to my computer or iPod. I've got lots of digital copies of movies which I never use. Only once have I ever watched a movie on my ipod and the experience was not very satisfying. If I had digital copies of concerts however, I would be very happy to put those on my ipod and play them since I would be caring more about the sound.I hope a few manufacturers read this post and take it to heart!"
5,"A ""Legacy Performance"" by Mark Knopfler and the group.","After years of wearing out my old VHS format of this legendary concert by Dire Straits, this digital rendering is finally available. For Knopfler fans, the multi-camera work provides great close-ups of his signature fingerpicking style on his Strat. Keyboard extraordinaire Clark is surrounded by melodic options and makes his presence known on every tune. ""Tunnel of Love"" and ""Telegraph Road"" must be ranked among the best live rock guitar performances ever recorded. No Dire Strait's fan will be content without this in their library."
2,Disappointing,I was very diaappointed in this Blu-ray version. The video is very dark and grainy due to low lighting in the original recording. Audio was less than stellar on a surround sound processor. All sounds are delivered up front where crowd noises could have been handle on rear speakers. This Blu-ray version should have had enhannced visual and audio presentations; the technology is available.
3,"Good show, great songs, but poor image","The show portraits the best years of the band Dire Straits, but the quality of the Blu-Ray images are not good, probably due to the quality of the original shooting."
1,A SLAP IN THE FACE TO MARK KNOPFLER & DIRE STRAITS,"I have to agree with multiple others here who have said that this product is deficient and sub-standard in virtually every respect. In fact, it is so poor in terms of the overall package (audio + video) that it does an incredible injustice to the world class artists involved. When all is said and done, Mark Knopfler will go down as one of the top five guitarists of all-time, and fortunately, the audio portion of this disc continues to preserve his outstanding artistry with a Fender Stratocaster, but to characterize the grainy, scratchy, 2nd rate video portion of this disc as ""Blu-Ray"" is misleading and almost unlawful! The quality of the video on my VHS tape of this same concert is INFINITELY superior to this so-called ""Blu-Ray"" disc. Save your money and hope that they re-release this performance again some day with video of proper quality."
4,"great dvd, but could have been better","I must agree with the previous comments. It is a shame that the picture quality on this dvd has not been improved. It does look like a clean vhs transfer. The story about old footage is absurd. Today with modern techniques the footage could have been surely improved. There are dvds with older, more primitive video and they look better than this one. See Led Zeppelin dvd and Majicat from Cat Stevens for example. And in the case of Majicat, you have extra footage where you can see the difference between the raw and finished footage quality.It has to be said that the sound upgrade is tremendous. And the documentary is a nice treat too. I'm not sure but I believe that there is footage of Lady Writer from this gig too, but not sure."
1,Image quality much worse than VHS,I can't believe my eyes. Such an image should not be legal on a blu-ray. I don't think I have any VHS casette that is so bad. This Blu Ray only use is to listen to music with TV/projector turned off. I don't think it has more than 320 initial horizontal lines. What a shame !!!
2,Not Very Good,"Compared to other Haribo products this one is not very good at all.Will not purchase again.Texture too hard, flavor lacking and flavors too similar between differetn colored fish."
5,great for students in dorms,"a 5 pound bag is funny enough....college students ate them all in a day, so i hear....."
5,"Umm, yeah, these are good!","My wife and I LOVE Haribo gummy bears. It's by far our favorite brand. So when we decided to have a birthday party at the beach for our one year old, and decided it would be a fish themed party, we started looking for gummy fish to buy.Lo and behold we found these on Amazon. They are every bit as good, if not better, than the Haribo gummy bears. Absolutely worth the price (which was actually very reasonable).We haven't yet, but we will be getting these again."
4,They're Gummis,"And lo and behold, they taste like Gummi candy. Not quite enough sweetness for me, but the Gummi texture is on target. And 5 pounds of Gummis is A LOT! No, really...a LOT! Good deal."
5,Inspirational,"In `Touching the light', Keith Zang has created a wonderful guide for those who are just beginning their spiritual path and also for those, like me, who have been on it for many years. The book is not only helpful on many levels it is fascinating as well. The author delves into subjects such as Reiki, spirit guides, the afterlife, angels and much more. All the information flows with a captivating ease that makes it difficult to put the book down.I highly recommend this book to anyone on the spiritual path. In fact I recommend that anyone slightly interested in even one of the several subjects covered in this book should pick it up. Although I have many spiritually related texts in my possession, `Touching the Light' will be one of the few that I know I will love turning to again and again for guidance and enlightenment. My heart filled thanks goes to Keith Zang for writing this beautiful book."
4,needs more slugs.,"Good cd , would have liked to heard more of the slugs singing their tunes tho....poor poor ronnie"
1,Piebald keeps getting worse and worse,"If it wasn't for Travis's annoying vocals, I'd swear this wasn't even Piebald. Are these guys scared of their old sound? Do they say ""No Comment"" when people ask about ""Sometimes Friends Fight"" and ""When Life Hands You Lemons""? I saw them play about a year ago and they didn't even TOUCH ""WLHYL"" and only played ""Marcus Garvy"" off of ""Venetian Blinds"". I won't see them play again. Even if they played their first two albums in their entirity, I wouldn't go. I'm that pissed off. Piebald sucks now. Period."
2,Wishful prehistory,"This is a gentle retelling of Bible stories from a feminine perspective. Unfortunately it is from a modern Orthodox woman's perspective, a woman apparently not at all aware of Archaeology. Anyone who is interested in the real lives of the women depicted in the Bible should read ""Did God Have a Wife"" by Dever. The early tribal women who ended up being the ancestors of the Hebrews were not monotheists at all, as much as this author wishes or believes that they were."
2,There are better collections out there,"The print quality of the photos in OLD NEW YORK IN EARLY PHOTOGRAPHS is quite good, better than most. And the quantity of the photographs is equally impressive. And that's about it for the positives.Arranged by neighborhood, the photos have little else to do with each other. There is no unifying theme holding the photos together. Not that every collection ought to have a theme as powerful as Jacob Riis' HOW THE OTHER HALF LIVES, but these photos seem so haphazardly arranged. The scanty text doesn't even attempt to explain how the individual vignettes came about, or how it relates to the particiular time in New York's history that the photo was taken. And, of course, Manhattan is the only borough represented here. I suppose the citizens of the other four boroughs had yet to climb down from their trees and build fires, never mind operate cameras.Rocco Dormarunno from ooog-ooog Brooklyn"
5,extastic-fantastic,"Flashback is a really good single. It lifts you up. There is nothing more to say to it. The video is great, too."
3,3 Stars for City By the Sea,"John Murhpy is an unknown composer to me, but City by the Sea is a pretty good album. Nothing groundbreaking, to be sure, but well-made and occasionally moving. The score is short, which is not a surprise considering it comes from Varese Sarabande, but if you can find it for cheap like I did (11 bucks) than it's worth it. In terms of action or suspense, there isn't much here. This is more of an experimental drama score, that sometimes has very tragic string, piano, and orchestral arrangements. It's not bad, and makes Murphy a name to look out for.cheersKZ"
3,ok,I thought this was nice to help remember Michael's life and legacy. It still makes me cry everytime I watch it..though it was not formatted well. It's amazing the things Michael was able to accomplish in the short time he was with us..though he was not given the praise he so well deserved here on earth. the good lord is making up for it in heaven.. rest in peace Michael.
3,Michael Jackson Memorial Tribute,"I was a little disappointed with DVD. The opening choir hymn(Going to See the King) was missing; and I feel that is really unfortunate because it was a really moving segment that contained the arrival of Michael's casket to the event. Also the video quality wasn't all that great, it is obvious that this is not a professional DVD."
1,MICHAEL JACKSON DVD,"LOUSY VIDEO QUALITY,IT'S AS IF IT WAS FILMED W/A CELL PHONE,VERY POOR..HAD TO RETURN IT...DON'T BUY THIS ONE..."
2,Incomplete badly done version of memorial,"Don't purchase if you expect a full version of the Memorial Service. Really wish I had not erased the taping of the service as this ""professional"" copy did not include the most moving scenes and was clearly taped from television!Oh, but if the Jackson family would simply agree to the beautiful service being shown again!!!"
2,Michael Jackson Memorial Tribute Video,I was expecting the same program that had been televised originally however this edition was more like a jackleg version and not a very good jackleg version at that.
1,Michael tribute,"As an advent admirer of MJ,I was very disappointed in this bootleg copy of Michael's Memorial. My VCR won't play poor quality bootlegs well. It kept freezing and skipping. Unfortunatly other matters were pressing so I missed the deadline for a return. I will wait until Sony or someone professional release copy of The Memorial to add to my collection. Shame on You."
1,eh,"i ordered this cause i thought it was the memorial itself, but it still had all the great short films"
1,does not work as advertised,"I upgraded from Punch's Super Homesuite because I wanted to do Heating and Air Conditioning design (as well as model my house which is a 1 and 1/2 story house - a two story house with a room with a vaulted ceiling to the second story). AS-18 costs more money and was a step back from Super Home Suite. The moderator for Punch's on-line community states the software is really meant for visualization, not for actual design. Actual design is what I purchased it for. I am a Licensed Professional Engineer. I purchased the software for some remodelling projects and perhaps a shed in the yard. 20 years in the business and i found this software difficult, frustrating and unsuitable. I am still looking for a capable & easy to use home remodelling/design program. I wish I would have checked the reviews from Amazon before buying."
1,AS18 Makes Simple Tedious,"I have read the book, used the online help and still, this program just makes simple things tedious. For example: I create a wall, then click to move it -- poof there's a flyout menu in your face. Click the wall again and NOW you can move it.There's just a lot of stuff like that. Little annoyances that make the simple, harder. I am extremely disappointed as the potential with AS18 is there. Maybe their new 3000 addresses some of the tedium, but I'm not willing to pay the price right now."
1,Won't fully charge and losses charge quickly.,"The battery will not charge completely, I bought this as a back up battery and am very disappointed. I would spend extra money and get a better battery."
5,New life for my old {OLD!} camera...,"Was about to give up completely on the little old digital camera I ""inherited"" from my daughter when her hubby bought her a new one - it's really old! Couldn't zoom anymore without draining the battery, even right after a fresh charge. Thought I would try one last thing and see if I could find a replacement for the battery online and voila ~ here it was! Only cost around 2 bucks and worked like a charm! Thanks Amazon ~ once again you saved the day! ;)"
1,Only works with good people,"Great book! I bought one for me and her. Tells you everything you could ever need to know or ask about starting and keeping a yonger man older woman relationship alive and well.BUT: After many years with the love of my life aged 55 and I 22. She had an affair on me and broke up with me two weeks ago!! She had everything she could have ever needed in this world but she got gready and wanted more so she went for the money man. Love ment nothing to her, I guess I was just her part time ""Boy Toy"" until she found better.I am CRUSHED I loved that woman more then life itself. Now she won't even talk to me. She had a frind of her's tell me that it would have never worked out and that I should move on with my life find someone younger and have kids, even though I told her I didn't want kids.So guys listen up before you end up just like me. STAY AWAY because the pain will be worse then all the good you ever had."
5,Colorful & tasty! :),"This colorful indian cookbook has photos of every recipe with simple directions. A lot of basic recipes for spice mixes & coconut milk, chapati, naan, other breads are this book along with a section at the beginning explaining cultural influences. There are tasty desserts like ""Cashew Nut Fudge,"" ""Pistachio Halva,"" along with wonderfully refreshing drinks ""Lime & Mint Drink,"" ""Indian Summer Punch,"" and more! Tasty main dish recipes for ""Creamy Saffron Fish Curry,"" ""Lemon & Coriander Chicken,"" ""Coriander Leaf Chutney"" and lots more. One comment I will make is that most of the main dishes are meat or seafood so if you are a strict vegetarian this may not be the right cookbook for you. It's a good basics cookbook for someone not familiar with how to make indian foods."
1,"Nice design, obnoxious cooling fan","This unit is a nice size and well-designed. But the cooling fan is amazingly loud. Loud enough to hear in a moving car. Loud enough that if I saw someone about to pull this out of their bag on the plane, I would offer my seat to someone else. It seems the designers realized this, and added a variable fan speed control to the design. So the unit goes from loud when it is idle to obnoxious when it is under load. What really frustrated me is that I called Targus and asked specifically if this unit has a fan. They said ""no"". They even double-checked. Grumble..."
3,LOUD,"Holy crap this thing is loud - almost returned it but really needed an inverter. Bought it because I needed to power my portable GPS in my car (didn't have a cigarette lighter adapter) - works great but man is it loud. When I came back I plugged it into my much larger, bulkier 350 watt inverter and decided to only use the new Targus Slim Line only for emergency/travel situations. For daily car use, I'm sticking with my much larger unit. Just too freaking loud."
2,"works, but incredibly annoying whine","Pro: Works as advertised.Con: This device makes a constant, loud, high-pitched whine, because it uses a tiny cooling fan that must be spun at high RPM to be effective. While in use, it sounds as if you have a mosquito inside your ear. Road noise at highway speeds and a loud radio are not enough to mask the noise."
1,Pathetic,"The sheer volume of intellectual dishonesty within the pages of this book is unbelievable. The author should be ashamed of himself for falsifying factual information. It is similar to proving that the world is flat despite all the contrary evidence.For any comments or questions please email Helmut Fien, PhD or Vahan Setyan, MS., PhD at setyan@CelsuInstitute.org, with subject heading - Historicity."
3,fletcher point removing tool,I have not had much chance to use this tool for what it is actually for. I did use it to bend the points up and reposition them back to their original position to frame 3 different pictures. I seems to be well made so I would assume it would work well.
3,The Hobbit Companion - A Look at Language,"This book is great as long as you realize what it is about. It is not a companion in the sense it explains the book and takes you by the hand to show you the hows and whys of everything. What the book does is explain how the language is used taking you from the formation of the word Hobbit to how the name of Bilbo Baggins explains both sides of his nature, rich upper-class do little hobbit to burglar for hire.The author looks at the importance of word play and word choice through out the novel. Overall an interesting look by David Day at the use and meanings used by Tolkien throughout the Hobbit."
2,Kind of silly,"While not utterly terrible, TE is a definate disappointment. The concept starts out as pretty cool but very quickly becomes borderline silly. The author struggles (unsucessefully) to find a meaningful story and the characters are flat and kind of juvenile (admittedly, they are young adults, but still...). One has to suspend a great deal of disbelief to stomach this book.I've never read Jack Williamson before and it is very unlikely that I ever will again.Not recommended."
2,Entertaining but nothing new,"This is a fairly entertaining book. However the plot is very similar to the plot in Stephen Baxter's ""Space"". The basis for the plot is, however, so much more solid in Baxter's book.The ending of the book is very abrupt. It seems like Williamson runs out of ideas, and hurrily tries to gather his stuff and leave."
1,A great idea gone so wrong,"What a waste of time this was. The start is good, but around page 80 I realized it was going nowhere. It's basically a bunch of unrelated random short stories; you could read the first chapter and the last one or jump from one to another without much trouble. Williamson tries to tell a story of cosmic proportions but fails mainly due to a group of very stupid and shallow characters.I've read some people's thoughts about this novel and believe me, this is NOT hard science fiction. Is just mediocre science fiction. The idea is good if not original, but the result is so, so bad.And Pepe's spanish (that is, Williamson's spanish) is not only ridiculous but insulting.Do not waste your time or your money in this. I'm sure Williamson has a lot of other, GOOD novels from where to choose."
