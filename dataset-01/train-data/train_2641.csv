1,Other Books WOuld Be Better to Read for Your Miney,"This book is essentially ridiculous. It is written by someone who is more concerned with his ego than actually conveying anything useful or meaningful. The author wanted to come to the United States to earn more money (which he did), yet he clearly has contempt for America. You are left with the sense that he is very proud to be such a cheap person. I would not recommend this book- save your money for biographies on people who are more noteworthy and less self-praising."
5,greatest table ever!!,This is the best toy a 1 yr old can have! Not only does it encourage my son in learning numbers and letters he also is learning motor skills with dancing to the music and different melodies. The volume is not too loud and makes a great travel toy since the legs remove easily and its lightweight!!
5,great learning toy,"We received this as a Christmas gift for our son. he did not take to it right away, but now he is about 13 months and loves it! He pushes it around the living room and turns the pages to make different sounds. He even dances when it plays music. Great learning tool, and very durable for active toddlers!"
3,Not much to this toy,"My son received this for Christmas when he was beginning to pull up and I was excited because it seemed like a great educational toy. After pushing the buttons for a few minutes he moved on to something else. Frankly, I think this is quite costly for something that just has a few lights and music and sings the alphabet. It's also a bigger toy that can't be put away easily. This toy is the kind that sounds much better in the commercials than what it truly is."
5,Simply perfect,"I bought this for my best friend's son for his 1st birthday. Although I wasn't able to be there in person to see him open it, she said this toy stole the show. It was the only one he would play with and can't get enough of it. Although he is learning quickly, this toy just makes it that much better for him to advance and perfect his sensory and learning skills. She was very happy and appreciative for this gift. When I asked her to help me rate this product, she gave it 5 stars!!"
5,My 8 month old's FAVORITE!!,"I got this toy when my daughter was six months old. She wasn't pulling up on things yet, so I left the legs off and she played with it on her tummy. A month later (when she did start pulling up in things) I put the legs on, and it's the first toy she goes for. She plays with it ALL the time. I would say this toy is by FAR her favorite. She'll play with it for hours (with tiny little breaks to rest her legs) But it's always been the first toy she goes for in the morning, and the last she plays with at night. Definetly worth the money."
5,Best table toy ever!!!,We bought our daughter this toy about 3 months ago and she still just loves it. She is 9 months old and it is one of her favorite toys. There are many different things to do. If your baby loves music like mine this is the toy for you. It has also been great to help her learn to pull up on. It's a great toy!!!
4,My almost one year old loves this toy!,"We bought this as a Christmas gift for our then 10 month old son. Knowing it is a toy that he can stand at was a big plus and definitely helped us to decide to go with this toy. He really enjoys the trombone, banjo and maraca. I think the functionality (turning the page) that changes the toy from music only to music and singing/talking is a bit subtle and is completely lost on my little guy. He seems to enjoy the toy in either mode. I can guarantee a good five minutes of playtime each time he goes to this toy."
4,Leap Frog Tabel Great for all ages!,I got this for my son (9 months old) for Christmas and I don't know who gets more enjoyment out of it my almost 5 year old daughter or my son. They both enjoy the music part of the table dancing and singing. The tabel encourages and supports my son in standing. He's having a great time with it.As an adult I love the 2 levels of volume (we always leave it on low) and the ease in which it was assembled.This is a must purchase for a family of music lovers.
4,Good clean fun,"We got this for Christmas for my 11 month old. We haven't had any trouble with it falling over but my girl can walk very well so she doesn't need it to help her stand. It has a FABULOUS volume control that is well hidden so baby can't turn it up. It can't possible be very educational though because so much is going on it is hard to focus on one thing. The music is very jazzy and she loves dancing to it. But it does loose her interest, as most toys do, after a few minutes. She does go back to it though. I wish it would play through an entire song without changing to some new noise but such is a parent's lot in life. :)"
5,Best Toy Ever!,"My daughter got this toy for her first birthday and she absolutely LOVES it!!! I love how much it teaches her like the ABC's. She even hums to the tune. As for the noise, I totally disagree. We put it in our living room and she plays with it while we watch tv sometimes and I can't complain about it being too loud. We do keep it on the softer setting, but it definitely not too loud. I am so happy we picked this table. I first saw it advertised on PBS, so I knew it would be a great learning tool. I haven't had any problems with tipping or anything and it was sooo easy to put together!"
4,My nephew loves this table,"I purchased the LeapStart Learning Table at Christmas-time for my 7 month old nephew. He loves it!! Although he doesn't walk yet, he enjoys pulling up to a standing position and walking around the table to explore eveything. He looks so adorable rocking side to side to the music and he especially seems to like the alphabet and counting songs. The only reason that I have not given this product 5 stars is because I think the legs could I been a bit more sturdy. But, I remedy that by making sure that I'm always close by to lend a hand if he needs it."
3,Lots of fun but a little too much for my one year old.,"My one year old enjoys this table, though he is far from mesmirized by it. There are so many different stations on this toy that he doesn't really focus in on any one and quickly moves on to other toys. My son is very active and seems to learn best when a toy has just a few lessons to teach (e.g., push the farm animal, hear the noises the make and have mommy tell him what the name of the animal is). I still think this is a pretty cool toy and hope that it will have much to teach him as he grows older."
5,a wonderful toy,My daughter received this for Christmas and loves it. She plays with it all of the time. It didn't take her long to figure how to go from the talking part to the musical part. This is really a great educational toy. Grandma was a big hit for buying this toy. Leap Frog has really combined a playful toy for the child and a great educational tool that a parent loves.
4,Not happy at first,Bought the learning table for my daughter at 9 months of age and was disappointed that she showed very little interest in it. Now a year later she's playing with it daily and loves the table.
3,A bit disappointed,My daughter is a year old and I searched high and low for some toys my daughter would play with longer then 1 minute. I was very excited when this came out. Unfortunetely she is still not spending more then a few minutes at this toy. I like Leap Frog products and think they are all wonderful! This product is very durable and the songs are wonderful. It just doesnt capture her attention well. I am still searching for toys she likes. I am very stumped.
3,Incorrect Description of Batteries Needed!!,"I bought this as a gift for my niece, and I wanted to include batteries. According to the product details shown online here it requires 44 (!!) AA batteries, so I also purchased 2x 24 packs. As it turns it, it only requires the more reasonable amount of *3* batteries. Hope this helps someone from making the same mistake I did!"
3,LeapStart Learning Table,"I purchased this for my one year old. And while it is entertaining and he loves it, he insists on climbing on top of it. Luckily the legs come off and he can sit on the floor and play."
2,Repetition and Tipsy,"The little boy I nannied received this table as a gift and I HATED it. The poor guy would pull it onto himself every time he tried to pull up on it (the age for which the table is reccommended, I believe), and when he got up there with my help, he really wanted to read the ""book"". Too bad the page turns ONCE?! Why even have a book-like thingy? I was really disappointed in the top-heavy-ness of this table, and took the legs off so he could actually play with it."
4,Not a favorite toy,"I bought this toy for my oldest son about 2 1/2 years ago. Now it is past down to my youngest who is one. My boys play with occasionally, but it does not hold their attention for very long. I personally like the toy except for two things: 1. The counting song I wish was more clear and slower 2. The purple door on the table comes off very easily."
5,SO GREAT,"We received this table as a gift when my son was about 8 months old. Today, he is 19-months-old and still loving it! When he was little, we could take off the legs and even put it in the crib with him (while Mom stole a shower). Now, he uses it to show off how he knows his colors, shapes, ABCs and numbers. He loves it...and he's even starting to get some of the more advanced aspects of the table...for instance, that when you turn the book page, you get music sounds, and when you turn to the ABCs page, it's all words and language. I HIGHLY recommend this. We use it a lot, and I think we've only had to change the batteries once."
5,A great purchase.,We received this toy for Christmas this year for our 8 month old. She loves it! It holds her attention for long periods of time (at least for an 8 month old). She is able to pull herself up on it and it doesn't tip over. She walks all around it and explores all the different sounds and switches.The volume control is a great feature and makes it a beloved toy forus (her parents) too.
5,A great investment,"My daughter received this toy as a gift when she was 7 months old. I held her up and pushed all the buttons for her the first time we played with it. She laughed and wiggled and has been laughing ever since. She started crawling toward it and pulling up on it every evening when we had floor time. I wedged it between the coffee table and sofa so it's harder for her to tip it over. This is a great educational toy. My daughter loves it and plays with it every day. She especially loves to hear the counting, since that is the button she plays with all the time. The other day she was actually verbalizing with the sounds. She is 9 months old, and laughs, babbles and wiggles every time she plays with it. This would be a great investment."
4,Good but too easy to climb,"My son received this for his 1st birthday. My son loves this toy and so do his 3 and 4 year old cousins. It is fun with many buttons to push. He loves to turn the page in the middle. He dances to the music he can make and it does teach different concepts like, up and down; abc's; and colors. The only complaint I have is that he can easily climb it and it topples over easily. I have resorted to taking off the legs and leaving it on the floor. It still is fun to play with and is one of his favorites. I do recommend this for younger than one year olds who are just learning to stand up, and after that, just pull off the legs."
5,Great toy,My daughter has one and she loves it. There is so much to keep her busy. The only thing is she is tall for her age and the legs on the toy are not. She actually gets on her knees to play with it. I wish the legs would of been a little taller but other than that it's a perfect toy.
4,Has ONLY 1 drawback!,This toy is exactly what everyone claims it to be... a great toy HOWEVER!!! there is a large plastic piece that turns like a page in the center of the table. My daughter is 8 months old and when she turns the page her other hand is sometimes under the page and she gets her fingers stuck underneath her body weight! Those little fingers with all that pressure can really hurt. The first time she did it her thumb was blue! I would HIGHLY SUGGEST anyone who gets this toy needs to monitor the child closely while they are playing with it.
5,one of the best,I let my son start playing with this at 5 months and this is one of the best toys that he had gotten for x-mas. My son has a longer attention span that most babies and he will keep him entertained for over a half an hour and I have been told that is a long time for them!
4,great start for toy collection,"Hi, I purchased Leapfrog Leapstart for my grandson. he simply loves it. It is versatile, can be used in many ways. It is colorful and attractive without being garrish. It is a useful learning tool for the young ones. I strongly recoomned it! 4 1/2 stars!"
5,Great toy!,This musical table is wonderful. My son has been playing with it since he was 4 mo old. He is now 1o mo and still loves it. It plays great upbeat music! My son lifts himself up and dances holding onto this table. He also learned to walk around it to reach different instruments.
5,Best Toy in The House,"After reviewing all the ""activity tables"" out there I found the Leap Frog would be my best bet since they are known for their educational toys. My Husband and I bought this for our daughters 6 month birthday and by far it was the best money spent on any toy in our house. Our daughter loves everything about this table. It is uaually the first toy she goes to and last one she is playing with before bedtime. We especially loved the fact you could take the top off of the base for your child to play with before they are able to pull up and play with it.My daughter has been introduced to many tables at school and at her grandparents and cousins house but this is the only one that really keep her attention. As soon as the music stops she back whirling the tables toys to make more music. We highly recommend this activity table."
2,Unsafe tipping problem - product does not support weight,"The advertising for this product shows a toddler pulling up to standing for the first time while attempting to reach the activities on this table. When my 11 month old attempted to pull herself up by holding onto the table, the table fell over on her and knocked her down. She was not happy.I would not recommend this product for children who cannot stand on their own. This is false advertising!"
5,One of the best toys out there!,"We registered for this item and are so glad we did. It amuses my 9 month old, who loves to stand at it, slap it and watch the lights. Our 2 year old neighbor also loves to come over and sing along with the songs it plays. It plays some neat little jingles - including some that are so catchy to adults that it is ridiculous! I find myself singing along all the time! It is very interactive and teaches a lot - songs, concepts, colors, numbers and the alphabet. Completely worth it.I also love the fact that the legs can come off very easily. When we travel, it is very easy to take it apart and throw it in the trunk of the car. No other toys this size can stand up to its versatility. I truly believe this is one item every child should have!"
4,Good purchase,"My daughter got this for Christmas last year when she was 7 mos. We kept the legs off for several months and she enjoyed playing with it a lot on the music section, then as she got around 12 mos and was walking we put on the legs and also started enjoying the learning section (abc's, numbers, colors, etc.). It tips over easier than I would expect and it doesn't hold her attention for long anymore (she's 15 mos), but overall it was a good purchase."
5,Get this today!,"My daughter is 6 months old now. I just got this for her. I have left it in the floor, w/o the legs on it, and I sit with her in the floor playing with it. She is now really trying to sit up b/c of this thing. She loves it, especially the frog w/banjo that spins around... she laughs and laughs. And I love that it has so many different sounds... it will take a long time for this one to get old as so many do so quickly. It is also very educational, one question though... why, when you slide the trombone does a muted trumpet play??? What is that teaching us??? It is also very easy to assemble... no tools needed... and the best part, it has to volume levels, and unlike some toys, they are pleasant levels. I wish that I had gotten this sooner, I am sure that she would be sitting on her own by now...I also hosted a neighborhood playgroup last week... kids from 6 months to 3 years old ---- they all loved this!!!"
5,We LOVE it,"My 11 month son loves this toy! (got it when he was 9 months) It helped him pull up. Now he runs around it! I dance to the music and now he knows which buttons I like to dance to so he hits them & looks at me to see me dance & he dances along. One thing, it does tip easily. It has fallen on top of him a couple of times. It is pretty top heavy and hurts when it go on top of him. He still loves it. The volume leavels are good. Not too loud or too soft. It's no too big. we take it long with us wherever we go. The legs come off easily as well in case you don't have the room in your vehicle."
4,Good Choice...,"You won't be sorry you purchased this game. I think it really helped our daughter master basic concepts like ""on/off."" Even now, at 18 months, she will strut by and roll the key that starts the ABC song. This was one of our daughter's favorite toys when she was younger. I'd say she enjoyed it most when she was around 7- 10 months old or so..."
4,We love it!,"I love this toy for my son and he loves it too. I love the educational features, and he loves the musical features. The only thing that I would change about it would be for the parent to have more control over whether the educational or musical features are being used, because I will turn the page to the educational part, but my son will turn it right back to the musical part giving the educational part not that much play time."
3,Purple Lid Comes Off Easily,"The purple open / close lid on the table comes off too easily. My 6 month old son is able to remove it with one hand and chew on it. The edges of the lid appear sharp so it has now been completely removed.Otherwise this is a fun table that has taught him a lot in being dextrous with his hands as he can now fiddle with most of the knobs, buttons, and gizmos."
5,Lil One Loving this,"Santa brought this for our 5 month old last Christmas. He just absolutely loves it. Since he couldn't stand yet, we just left the legs off and put it on the floor for him to play with. Once he started standing/cruising we put the legs on & he walks around and plays with everything. He'll stand there for 10 or 15 minutes sometimes, just playing by himself. He's almost a year now and it is still one of his faves that he just goes to and plays with."
5,GREAT TOY WITH LONGEVITY,"My daughter received this toy as a Christmas gift at 6 months old. You can use it without the legs for smaller children. She loved pushing the different buttons and hearing the different sounds. It didn't take her long to figure out how to push and pull the different levers and buttons to get different sounds. She loved the ""spinner"". As she got older and was able to stand, we put the legs on it for her and she loved pulling up with it and standing up like a big girl. She's now 14 months old and still plays with this toy and I can honestly see her playing with it til she's 3 or 4. My 5 year old niece even likes it. Right now she mainly enjoys it for the sounds, but as she gets older it will be a great learning tool for colors, shapes, ABC's, counting. It's a great quality toy, too. It's nice to actually have something that will keep her interest for more than a couple months and will actually last that long, too! I highly recommend this toy."
5,Mommy,I love the LeapStart Learning table. Both my husband and I thought this would be a great gift for our son's 1st birthday. The music it plays is simply the best and the lights are a great addition. He loves playing with the buttons and following the colors. And a great bonus is that our 3 year old son now loves counting and saying his A-B-C's!!! This is a great item to get for your child.
5,great attention getter!,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 8 months old, and it is the only toy that has kept his attention for more than five minutes. He was so excited to play with it that I had to give it to him before even putting the legs on it! It has so many different things to keep his attention, and 2 modes - educational (letters and numbers) and musical. Also, the sound effects are not obnoxious and sound very clear. You can actually understand what they're saying! And the batteries last forever. I've left the toy on for weeks at a time and it's still going! The only problem I've found is when my son was first learning to pull up, he would grab the handles on the side of the toy and end up pulling it down on himself. Not recommended for babies LEARNING to pull up. Once he knew how, it was no problem. I highly recommend this toy for anyone looking for something educational and fun."
4,Watch out for little fingers,"While this toy is a lot of fun, please be careful of little fingers. It is easy for them to get pinched in the book, especially if more than one child is playing with it. I would not buy it just for this reason after seeing it happen to several children in the course of about 30 minutes."
1,Dislike,I feel that the leap frog table is poorly designed. A 6 month old to a 2 year old has a very little attention span. With this table the on/off switch is on the bottom of the table. I realized with mine that my son would play with the table and after a short period of time he would get bored with it and after another short time he wanted to play with it again. If you left it on then the battery ran out after NO TIME WHAT SO EVER and if you kept turning it off and on then it the child soon realizes that you are turning it over every time you turn it on and off and thinks that this is more fun that playing with the table itself. They flip the table over and the legs fall off and then they cant flip it back over on their own. I think on a large toy like this the on/off switch hould be part of the top of the table.
5,AWESOME!!,"My daughter LOVES this learning table. We've had ever since she was about 6 months old... we took the legs off and she plays with it like crazy. Now that she's standing (she's almost a year now) she still loves it the same. I like all the different toys on the table. My daughter loves turning the pages, and playing the piano. It's a great toy... definitely worth the money!!"
3,Good toy.. but maybe defective...,"My son started playing with this toy at 3 mos. He just loved it; He would push the keys, spin the spinner and play with the book. However, after about 4 mos of use it stopped working. I went through 3 different sets of batteries, thinking that was the problem.. still wouldn't work. My husband opened it up and portions of the electronics were scorched..as if it got too hot from use and just burned out. There was no recourse on our end..so we had to throw it out. I bought a different learning table, Fisher Price,, but my son doesn't seem to enjoy it as much. All in all great toy and provided lots of entertainment for our little one, We could have just had a defective one."
5,Great toy but NOT sturdy,We bought this so that he could pull himself up to stand but the table falls over on him most of the time. He is tall enough that he can sit on his knees and reach everything though. I like this toy but don't get it as something for your child to teach themselves to stand!
5,My son's absolute FAVORITE toy!,"This has been one of the best toys we have ever bought our son. We gave it to him when he was 6 months old without the legs on so he could sit up and play with it. Within a month he was using to to learn to stand up! We then attached the legs and he will play with it for at least an hour every day. He loves it as does his 4 1/2 year old sister. He loves flipping the page, and smiles every time he does it! He loves listening to the alphabet song and pushing the colorful buttons. The sounds are not irritating (like some toys) and friends will come over to play and they all want to play with it at once. I would recommend it to every parent out there!"
5,joey's past xmas gift,"my son joey learned alot from this toy. he learned to sing a lilbit, learn to start counting and say ing his abcs... he does a lil but not much but i recomend this to anyone with kids . my son is now 2 and loved it."
4,Great Table for Twins!,"I am a mom of twin boys - 9 months old - and they both like the table a lot. There is a lot to explore on the table - the music, the different sounds of instruments, the singing of the alphabet and numbers, and the lights. My sons are just learning to climb up on everything so this table offers a safe option and something to do once they are standing up. There is an option to lower the sounds which is great because the music can get annoying after awhile. Overall, a great table."
4,She loves it!,"We bought this for my daughter at Christmas, when she was about 6 months old. We left the legs off of it until she was starting to stand by herself pretty well. She loved it from the first day we got it out. She still stands and plays with it often at almost a year old, and she has figured out how to make the ""good music"" with the maraca, and that turning the page makes the lady stop talking. :) She much prefers the music side. This toy is even enjoyable for my husband and I, who often sit with her and play with it. It has a lower volume button, but it isn't annoying even at the loud setting, unless my ADD husband is TRYING to annoy me with it. :) THE ONLY thing that I don't like is that she can pop the purple lid off very easily. She loves the jazz lady that sings when she opens it, but she gets too excited and pulls it off. But even with that, I love this toy. I'm so proud that we bought it for her."
4,great toy,MY child recieved this when she was 5 months old and it didn't interest her. Now that she is 9 1/2 months old she loves it. She pulls her self up and doesn't stop banging at it. It will hold your babies attention for long periods of time.
3,This needs recalled!,"I am from the toy industry and have had this toy for about a month. There is a purple lid on the tray my child broke off. The lid has two small ends that snap into the tray. These ends broke off leaving two very small parts that ended up in my childs mouth. In fact, I can not even find one of the two ends which is probably in my childs stomach. This is very dangerous and Leap Frog needs to fix this immediately. I can not be the first to have this happen. I am just waiting for my child to get very sick. These are considered small parts that will fit into a small cylinder for measuring whether a part is considered a choke hazard. There is no doubt this needs recalled before there is a very serious injury."
2,sorry item,this isnt at all like it says in the product description. The table only has 4 things it does on 2 different wavelengths. I could have saved the money and bought my grandson a 2 dollar piano and it would have done the same thing
4,Leap Frog Table,"We got this for our niece. She loves all the different music and pulling herself up on it, and now walking to it."
2,FINGERS!!!!,"I wish I'd have read the reviews before purchasing this table. My son loves it, until he smashes his fingers in the book. He has his hands up there and flips the page with the other hand putting his full weight on it. This is in the standing position with the legs on it. He's too young to realize what he's done, so he keeps smashing them. This is the worst part of the table. I hate it. I hate hearing my son scream when he does this. No more table for him. This needs to be fixed!!"
2,Disappointed by LeapFrog,"First up, we are HUGE LeapFrog Lovers and have over 13 of their toys for our two little ones.Because i'm such a LeapFrog Fan, i went out and bought this before doing any research or even reading the box at the store. I'm very disappointed in the music choices this toy has. There is no classical music (like the LeapFrog ABC Ball), no nice songs and tunes (like the LeapFrog Learning Cube) and so on. Overall it's a ok toy, teaching some basics and having a couple of activities. It's just not what i'm used to from LeapFrog and the Toy is going back tomorrow."
2,Not worth it,"I thought this would be a great toy for my son so we got it for Christmas last year when he was 1. He used it to pull himself up and liked the fact that he could flip the book back and forth and pressed the color keys over and over again but other than that there wasn't much interested. I'm expecting a baby in a couple of weeks and i'm hoping that i'll get a little more use out of it when she's a little older so it's not such a complete waste of money and space. It might be good for babies 9 - 12 months but for the price, it's not worth buying to use for such a short time."
5,Superb for young babies,"We bought this for our now 9-month-old son. It's his favorite toy. At first, we took off 2 of the legs which propped up the table at a perfect angle for him to sit on the floor and play with it. Now, we have all 4 legs attached and he stands and cruises around the table. Thank you Leap Frog!"
4,Like it but could be better,"We bought this for our 8 month old son. He loves to play with it and right now it's probably his favorite toy.We are having problems with the purple flap - it comes off constantly. Each and every time he plays with it, the flap pulls off. I've tried to contact Leapfrog twice and they don't respond to me. The other issue we are having is that when he moves from a standing position to a seated position he hits his mouth on the sides. We've had two bloody mouths in a week. It would be an even better toy if it was trimmed in rubber or something a little forgiving."
4,Wonderful Learning Toy,"My daughter received this for her first bithday. She just loved it. This table would keep her busy longer than any other toy she own. She loved listening to the ""ABC"" song over and over again. It has a ton of visual and audio activities. I would have rated it 5 stars but the original one that I received was 'haunted'. In the middle of the night it would shout out 'yellow' or 'blue', etc. I had to make sure I had it in the shut off mode before going to bed. I traded it in for another one and the second one the volume was broke on the purple door that opened and closed. I never did get around to exhanging that one. All in all it was one of the best gifts she ever received."
2,"As the ""tables"" go, this one was a disappointment","My son is into the ""dexterity"" phase, as most kids are around 6-12 months, while also learning to stand and balance. To accomplish such challenges silmultaneously, the concept of a learning table is perfect. However, this table was a big disappointment.It has nothing but lights and sounds...no buttons to push, levers to pull, pages to turn. It kept his attention for a minute at the most, then he was off to something else. I promptly returned the table and replaced it with the one my mom found made by Fisher-Price. MUCH better."
2,Nothing Great,The table is okay. It's definately not worth $50. I can not keep the table working for long because it sucks the batteries dry in a few days(even when I turn the table off when my daughter isn't using it). My daughter likes the toy but since the batteries die almost as soon as I put new ones in she can't play with it for long. It just collects dust.
2,Not for my active 9 month old,"Bought this toy for my 9 month old who only wants to stand and walk now. In all fairness I usually have a hard time picking out toys he'd like because his only interest is moving around.The toy was easy to put together and was sturdy.Unfortunately the LeapStart Learning Table did not hold his attention, he had no interest in the toy. I tried to show him all the functionalities, but he just continued ignoring it."
2,My son is not interested in this toy!,"I read all the reveiws posted for this toy and ordered it the same day from amazon. I have had it now for about 3 weeks and my 10 1/2 month son is not interested in it at all. I think he has played with it for a totaly of 5 minutes since I put it together. I was so disapointed. I had already purchased the arcade pop and fly toy for him and he plays with that table non-stop. I wish I had never purchased it. He likes to put things in his mouth and carry things around the house and he cannot do that with this table. It's very cute with great music, but I just can't get him to play with it."
2,"Hurt my son's fingers - catchy music, but not much else",We got our 10 month-old son this table when he discovered it at a friend's house and played with it the whole time we were there. When we got ours home and put it together we couldn't believe how wobbly the legs are! It literally sways back and forth when you play with it. The sounds and music do change way too much resulting in a chaotic mix when he is playing with the different levers. THE BIGGEST ISSUE I have had is that the book page pinched my son's finger in the hinge and it was stuck in there while he was screaming at the top of his lungs. His poor little finger had a blood blister! We would bring it back for a refund but don't have the receipt or the box. Now he only plays with it if we are playing it with him. It doesn't hold his interest long anyway. It should be recalled because of the segmented hinge that pinches!
2,Less is more,"We received this table as a gift from my husband's parents and had them return it the next day. There was just too much going on at once to be at all helpful for learning and organizing thoughts. Each independent area of this toy has educational value, but in our opinion it was just too chaotic for coherent thought development. Our son seemed to like it, but his normally calm manner of playing was much more hyper and unfocused. Also we found it did not stand well for a child that was not yet steady on his/her feet."
5,Great Activity/Learning table!!!!,"My 1 year old daughter received this for christmas from her grandparents and she just loves it. She is still at the pulling up stage and this thing is sturdy! She's not pushed/pulled it over! She loves all the different music that it plays and dances right along. Then she flips the page in the middle to the ABC/123 mode and listens to the lady counting or singing the ABC's and much more. I,too, almost got her the activity table with the blocks but am so glad she got this one. She picked up on all of the activities very quickly and plays with it ALL the time! Right now she's basically interested in the sounds and lights but I know as she grows that the educational value will come into play as she's able to understand more!Great toy even if it is a little bit more costly....but much more fun than the others!You won't regret it!"
5,Lizzie loves it!!!,"We bought this for our grand daughter Elizabeth (11 mos old)as a toy for her to play with at Poppa's house. Lizzie spends a great deal of time with it, she seems to like the tactile parts of pushing the brightly colored keys and shapes as well as listening to the great music and songs and looking at the flashing lights. She will crawl off and do something else but all you have to do is push a key on the table and she will come back to play with the table some more. She especilly likes to put her ""O""'s in the little compartment...food, sounds and working the door delights her. A very-very nice learning and entertainment toy.Fast forward three years to 2009.... this toy continues to delight my second and third grandchildren Danny and Isaac. If the table isn't in the family room they will both go searching for one of their favorite play things. Still on the original Duracell batteries!!!"
5,This is a great learning toy,"My husband bought this for our daughter when she was 6 months old. It took her awhile to figure out what to do, but now at fifteen months she still plays with it. There is a small purple door that has storage space where we put her snacks and she enjoys finding them there. I would recommend this table to anyone."
2,Malfunction and smells burned,After 2 months of use (my son just played maybe 10 minutes a day) it began to malfunction and after a few minutes where the loudspeaker is smelled a lil burned. My son had fun when it worked but now he's just disappointed when he tried to play and doesnt work he looks at me with a sad face :((
2,ack!,"The kids may like it, but my gosh...the toys is driving me absolutely up the wall. it is so noisy. repetitive noisy. the kind of noise that slowly (or quickly depending on how much my darling plays with it) driving me insane. The music is catchy, sure, but hitting the same button over and over and over again is making me want to pull my hair out.I don't care how much she loves it! the minute this toy is not as interesting, it is going to charity!"
3,A limited toy but fun for physical development of 8-14 mo old,"We got this for my son when he was 10 months old, and he loved it... for a short while. By the time he was 14 mo old, he had outgrown it. He would periodically come over and push a few buttons but his interest would wane in a short time.It's a great toy for helping little ones get interested in playing while standing... but once they are walking (my son started walking at 11 mo and never looked back), they get quite bored with it. I prefer toys that have a multiple purpose, and encourage open play, but sometimes you have to have the loud electronic toy that flashes... this is a good choice for that type of toy."
3,Not as pleased as I hoped I would be.,"My daughter received this as a gift for her second Christmas. I like the fact that if she was smaller, she could play with this while it was on the ground, but since she stands the legs are on. My daughter doesn't take much interest in this toy. The book in the center has a purpose but I wish there was more to it other than turning the pages to change the settings of the table. Sometimes when we're not even at the table, it plays on its own. I wish this was a little more interactive and had more to it than it does. Such as the letters and numbers, I wish you could press them and have the table tell you what letter is you pressed.I'm sure this is a great toy for other children, but my daughter just doesn't care for it so I'm glad I didn't buy it and waste my money on it. Unfortunately due to my hopes of it having more than it does, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I don't hate it though, just wish it was better than it is for us."
5,A Wonderful Toy!,"""Santa"" brought this to our daughter for christmas and she was facinated at once! She was 9 months at the time and now at 15 months she still plays with it often. She dances to the music shaking her little butt, and points at the frogs. I really liked that the legs are removable as she wasn't standing when we got her the table. She had an even more renewed interest once she started standing and it moved up with her. This is a very fun toy that holds interest, is sturdy and as all Leapfrog products educational."
2,just so so,"This toy is one of those things that is only fun for the first day or two. I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 10 months old. The only time she played with it was when it was the only thing she could reach, while sitting on my lap. It is also chaotic--if a button is pressed soon after another one, it interrupts what it was saying. Since kids like to bang a bunch of keys at once, the jingles end up playing just the first syllable before switching to the next one. Irritating. No off button. The ABC song is slightly different than the one most kids know, so it could be confusing--I don't know why they couldn't stick to the original.Also--kids in the age group may be learning to climb. This is the perfect height to try to climb onto, so WATCH THEM; it is not very sturdy."
4,LeapFrog LeapStart Learning Table,"I bought this toy for my 1year old and she absolutely loves it. She is a hard one to entertain and usually gets tired of her toys easily. This toy, however, has proven that even the toughest critic (my daughter) can be won over. My only regret is not getting it sooner!"
5,This product is wonderful,"I bought the Leapstart Learning Table for my son when he was 6 months old. I was looking for something that would keep his interest and be a great learning tool. This product does both! I have not found a learning tool/table, that compares to the Leapstart Learning Table for babies 6 months+. Now at 8 month my son still get excited with he get to play with his Learning Table."
5,A MUST HAVE,"The learning table is the only toy my son comes back to time and time again. He has had the toy since he was 9 months old, he is now 13 months and he plays with it like it was brand new. Lots of music, but also learning with music. A great must have."
5,Spectacular toy!,"My son got this gift for christmas when he was three months old, and has played with it every day since...he learned to pull himself up to standing, and began cruising around it before walking!! At 27 months and going, it was a great investment!"
5,This was the best toy we have ever bought!!,"We gave this to our daughter for Christmas when she was 7 months old, and anytime we go anywhere, we take it with us. She could play with it for hours! My husband and I agree, that it was the best thing we bought for our little girl. She plays with everything on it. When we take it places, other kids of all ages just love it!! She never gets tired of it. She loves to flip the pages, and she bobs her head to the music. It is definetly something that has grown with her. It is so solid! It even took my friends (not so little) boy climbing on it. Excellent toy! I would recomend it to anyone!!!"
5,The Perfect Gift,"This was given to my 9 month old son for Christmas. He instantly loved it and continues to play with it non-stop. The legs are detachable, so he could sit and play with it. Now that he is standing, it was a ""snap"" to reassemble the legs! The music sounds nice. The table plays a number of songs so you don't go insane listening to the same song over and over. The best part is that it only takes 3 AA batteries. My son has played with it everyday since Christmas and we have yet to replace the batteries. This was the perfect gift!"
3,It was great...until she started walking,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she loved it! Couldn't get enough of it. Now, she is 13 months old, walking and doesn't even look at it anymore. She just isn't interested in standing in one place and playing with a toy. She likes things that keep her moving and are more interactive. I think the table is great all in all, but wish I would have gotten it for her earlier to really have gotten my monies worth."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"My 8 month old son LOVES this table. You can leave the legs off for floor play or you can put them on for standing.It will sing and play music with every touch of everything on the table. Each thing does something different. If you turn the page on the book in the center it talks with every touch. Very ineractive and very educational and fun!! He absolutely LOVES it!!! Very durable, sturdy, educational and FUN!!!!!!Good ahead, buy it it is worth it!!!"
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!,"We got this for my daughter before she could stand. It was perfect for her to play with in her lap. As soon as she was able to pull up, we snapped on the legs (with ease, I might add!). She plays with it daily, and never seems to get bored. She now can walk around the table, and is able to manipulate the various noises more easily. I look forward to her being able to sing the ABC's with it as she continues to grow. This is worth every penny!!"
5,One Toy You Have To Get,"I love this toy! Every morning first thing my 11 month old daughter does is go right for the learning table. She supports herself up by the table and starts dancing to the music. There's a little tray that I fill with Cheerios and my daughter just loves opening it up and finding Cheerios in the tray. All the musics are fun and most importantly, it keeps my daughter's attention for a long time. There's a volume control and a on / off switch. Before I got this toy, I thought the noise might drive me little crazy (like my daughter's other toys) but it really doesn't. This is one toy you have to get for your child."
5,The Frog That Really Is A Prince!,"LeapFrog has designed the most entertaining toy my daughter has ever used. She received it as a Birthday present last week when she turned one and when I first turned it on she bee-lined to it and played with it for 15 minutes nonstop! Even when something else diverted her attention, she came right back to this toy within a minute or two. I am sure that she will learn her numbers. letters, shapes, colors and appreciation for Jazz vocals from this toy alone."
2,"Not worth the money, does not hold childs interest","I bought this toy at a neighborhood yardsale, and I'm glad I only spent $5.00 on it. My 10 month old son is too tall for it already. He has to bend over just to play with the buttons. The toy also does not hold his interest very long at all, maybe 3 or 4 minutes at the most. I'm hoping that as he gets older maybe he will enjoy it more, but for now it just takes up space and the lady's voice is very annoying on it."
2,Cheap and Dangerous,"This is not worth $40!! It is extremely cheap and it didn't teach my daughter anything. It broke an hour after it came in the mail. And my daughter, who has one tooth, managed to chew a hole in the carcass of this cheap toy. Now, all you moms out there, would you want your child to swallow a piece of plastic and choke and die?????Now, this toy may be a tiny bit fun with it's little annoying noises and sounds, but DO NOT GET THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Exciting but Dangerous, buyer beware","My son received this table for Christmas. He does love all the interesting things that it can do. Unfortunately, every time he tries to pull up it tips over on him. This is unacceptable, and very dangerous for any baby to experience. I am thoroughly disappointed. In the past, my children have enjoyed the excellence of Leap Frog products. The table just does not live up to that. When I called them to explain the problem, they told me to not let my son use it as a table to just put it on the floor. However, it is advertised specifically to help babies pull up and learn. In Baby Talk Magazine the description for it is titled ""Pulling Up"". I found it disturbing that Leap Frog was not interested in my child's safety. They did not want me to send the table to them for inspection to prevent this happening to other children. My son loves this table, but it is just unsafe, and Leap Frog takes no responsiblility for that fact."
1,Make it stop!,"My daughter's grandmother bought this for her as a Christmas present and it's the worst toy I've ever seen. As if there wasn't enough crap when kids get OLDER that dumbs them down!Very simple acitivies, nothing to ""learn"" about it once they're past about 8 months old and they should have mastered these skills. It's just a table o' chaos - overstimulation anyone? This is great at keeping kids entertained, but there are BETTER, simpler toys that will keep them playing and learning for a much longer time - try anything by Melissa & Doug."
2,Enough with the ADD inducing toys,"We asked my mom to buy this for our son's first birthday. He loved it, for a minute-- he pushed all the buttons at once, and a couple times he danced to the music. It soon went untouched in favor of simple toys and books. We've since decided to stop buying things with lights, music, and sounds. I don't believe for a second that this sort of toy teaches ABCs, colors, etc. to this age group- it's just a bunch of noise. Do your kid a favor and get something else."
4,Pretty Great Toy,"We received this table as a gift from grandparents for my oldest son's first Christmas. He was 7 months old at that time and we went ahead and put the legs on the table first off. He used the table to pull up on and the would play with it. As he got older, he would dance and wave his arms to the tunes -- cackling the whole time. We put the table away for a few months and brought it back out recently as our second son is starting to stand/pull up. It is just as big of a hit with him and my oldest is starting to benefit from the learning aspects of the table, i.e. repeating abc's and counting along with the numbers. It is really a great toy that your children will play with for a long time!My oldest did like to climb on it once he got around the 1 year mark. It is a small table, so it will tip over if climbed on.-Michele"
4,Good toy,"Our daughter received this toy as a Xmas present from her grandparents and she loves it! She specially likes the ""country like"" music and she plays it over and over while dancing around the room. If it makes our little one happy then it's good :)"
5,Love it!!,I bought this for my 8 month old son as a Christmas present. He loves it!! The legs are detachable so it can be used on the floor or as a table. This has really helped my son with standing. He plays with it more than any other toy. I definitely recommend this awesome Learning Table for every child!
4,emma,The product was what I thought it would be. My granddaughter (7 months) is able to stand at the table and it holds her weight nicely. She can even pull herself up from a sitting position and it holds her.She also loves it because while standing she can play and listen to all the music and learn coordination.
5,THIS ONES A KEEPER!!!,"My daughter has had this toy since she was 6 weeks old. We introduced it to her at about 4 1/2 months when she started sitting up on her own. From the start she just adored this toy! She is now just about 9 months and still plays with this toy every single day. The purple open and close lid does pop off a little easy, but I just pop it back into place for her. This is definately worth the money and gauranteed to keep your child's attention for more than 2 minutes!!!"
5,another great leap frog toy,"Get it, Get it, Get it.This is such a fun toy, it is educational and stimulating, It has a cool jazzy sound, and you'll find yourself humming the music later. It has two volume settings, and the detachable legs make it easy for toddlers to stand up to it, or just crawl to it.The only bad thing is that it has a little purple door that opens and closes, and it falls of easily. But the rest is awesome."
1,Need to Ship these out faster or offer money back.,"I ordered this on a Thursday to arrive by Monday as a Birthday gift for my nephew for his first birthday. It took over a week and a day to just ship it out. Don't believe the info on the web site that says it will ship out in one day. I paid for the faster shipping hoping to get it to him for the day after his birthday but this will only be a very belated birthday gift. Haven't even had a chance to see the product, normally Amazon has not dissapointed me but this time around I am not too happy. Then even if you try to contact someone at Amazon, good luck, there is no customer service anywhere to be found, the help system stinks and just runs you in circles. Hope this product is the best thing since sliced bread, it will be like pulling teeth for me to order products from Amazon again."
2,Okay toy but my kids never played with it,"What can I say, there is no accounting for childrens' tastes. I purchased this for my daughter and son and they only played with it for about half-an-hour before toddling and crawling off never to play with it again.There is nothing wrong with this toy. It seems rugged enough--it is not terrible stable but doesn't break when it falls over-- but they did not find it very entertaining. Son crawled off to play with giant legos and daughter went off to play with Barbie.Perhaps the problem is the lack of diversity in what the table can do. I mean after you make the banjo play a few times, how exciting is it to make it do it again. Likewise, it does not offer any opportunities to use/develop one's imagination.For the price you might want to look elsewhere. Ours went to the neighbors twins."
5,Love this Toy!,"My now ten month old daughter loves this toy and has since she got it for Christmas two months ago. Since she wanted to be standing all the time, we were looking for a toy that she could stand and play. This one is perfect. It's durable, no worries that she will tople over. And there is so much going on! She loves the music and dancing to the ABC song!!"
5,We All Love This Toy!,"My son (1 yr) just received this toy as a gift. We all love it. It has a high and low feature so it's never too loud, which I wouldn't even mind - the music is jazzy, the singing is hip. It gets us all interacting with my little boy, we all love to play and sing along with this toy. And it's the toy that holds my little boy's attention the longest, he really enjoys the lights, sounds and singing. He has recently just started to try to sing along himself.I highly recommend this toy for fun, education and safety."
3,Very unstable!,When my daughter started to pull up on things I took everything out of her reach that was of any danger. I purchased the learning table b/c it advertised that it encouraged a child to pull up to standing position. I took it out of the box and she immediatly pulled up to it to play. Within 3 minutes she fell down and the table fell down on top of her! I will be bringing this item back!!
5,We love it!,"Our daughter loves her learning table! We gave it to her when she was 5 months old. We took the legs off so she could sit and play by herself. Now, she is 8 months old. We just put the legs back on and she pulls herself up on her knees to play with it. It seems to be one of her favorite toys."
2,It broke!,"I bought this for my son for Christmas and right after about 3 months, it broke! It no longer makes any lights nor does the sound work. I tried changing the batteries and wiping the contacts with rubbing alcohol, but none of it works. The warranty runs out after 3 months-how convenient! My son was only 9 months old loved it while it lasted. It sounds like I just got a dud...."
3,Unstable and dangerous,"The legs are wobbly, not good for a child that stands. It's very noisy too which my daughter loves so I gave it 3 stars. We took the legs off so she plays with it on the floor. Don't buy it if your child is just learning to stand or walk."
3,Good but annoying,Speaker broke without much use (a common leapfrog problem) and the purple door comes off. Customer service told me the door is supposed to come off but I think that makes it hazardous. Great idea for a teaching toy. Just needs to be better made.
4,Great Product - one minor flaw,"To date, this is the best money we've spent on a toy for our 11 month old son. The only complaint is that he now loves to detach the purple door which can be pulled off. I've heard the same complaint from others so wondering why LEAP hasn't fixed it. Either way, that's a small price to pay. We'd buy it again in a second."
2,"Not very educational, and stopped working","For something to be educational for a one year old, they have to be able to see some sort of cause and effect. This doesn't. The noises/songs go on for too long for a toddler to really understand how one button causes one noise and a different button causes another. My son still liked it, but then it stopped working after about a month - some sort of an electronics problem, where it just made a horrible screeching noise. Not very impressed."
3,Not a great toy for climbers!! Computer chip mind of it's own.,I have twins who are little climbers. Not stable with legs on... so we took them off! Great toy with the exception that it has a mind of it's own and will just start playing that constant grating music!! We had to put it in the gameroom in the basement.
5,hands down winner,This toy was definitely worth the $'s. It assembles easily-just snap the legs on and go. The legs also remove very easily for storage-just push a button.We got this for my daughter for Christmas when she was 4 months old. She initially played with it on the floor without the legs on. Once she started pulling herself up we put the legs on it. the legs are broad and stable on this to keep it from tipping over when your child pulls up on it.My daughter is almost 18 months now and she still plays with it daily-she loves to turn the page on the book to make the different sounds.
5,Definitely worth the money!!,"I bought this for my then 1yr. old daughter last year for Christmas based on its great reviews and I have to say that it is the best ""toy"" we have ever owned. My daughter could sing her abc's (almost all the way thru correctly) by the time she was 16 months old and she started counting up to 10 by the time she was 18 months old! My oldest daughter who had just turned 3 hadn't even been able to go all the way thru the alphabet or count past 5 without ""messing up"". So she also benefited from the learning table because now she ""knows her abc's"" like a pro! I truly think if a child has just 1 toy, this should be it. Both kids still like to play with it and hear the songs. My younger daughter is now learning her shapes with the help of the learning table. I highly recommed this toy!"
5,"So far, so good!","Got this today for my 6.5 month old. There are LOTS of songs, activities, learning tools that I would highly recommend this to any parent. I watch her play with this and see her trying to figure things out...any time an activity can do that I am impressed. It's really cool because it can just lay flat on the floor for now so she can reach everything. Plus the variety in the sounds and songs is a lot more enjoyable for me too since some toys just play the same thing over and over."
5,Great,"Great toy, my daughter played with it every day for about nine months and now she still plays with it occassionally. She started to dance and learn about rhythm with it as well as being caught by the colors and sounds. I recommend it to everyone who has a baby."
5,Perfect for all ages,"This toy has been a favorite from 6 months to 2 years so far. The music is great, the toy is educational, and it promotes standing. I also love the two volume settings and how easily the legs unattach for use on the floor or in the car. Excellent buy, easily worth the money."
1,Didnt fit the phone.,"I got this for my mom and it didnt fit her phone, even tho her phone is listed as it would work."
2,Not Stable,"This tripod is flimsy, has slack in all of the leg joints and is really hard to stabilize. They provide a small ground anchor screw and bungee cord which does very little for the stability. I use this for our RV when we travel and ended up strapping it to our spare tire which I leveled on the ground prior to mounting the tripod. This worked great but really looked low rent. Unless you are in a place with level ground and no wind, you will find this hard to use. Take a ratchet tie down and strap it to something."
2,Don't be fooled by the title,"I bought this book thinking it would help with my insurance company pay my claims they denied (no names, but their initials are Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Georgia). It wasn't helpful in that way. This book seems to focus on people who actually have a choice on picking what insurance they want. It doesn't help the 99.9% of employees who don't have any choice on what insurance plan they're offered.The book clearly explains all the ins and outs of insurance companies, but is little help in ""making them pay."""
1,Overly Simplistic and Out of Date,"Extremely simplistic and brief (139 pp), it dwells on the obvious such as 'what is sound,' or 'what is a microphone'. This book was originally written when sound capture and playback were analog tape-based, with minor edits to give passing mention to digital recording. There are 8 pages of simplistic block diagrams (a full page each) on how to plug sound sources and outputs into an analog mixer, but not a word on post-production software. I am new to sync sound production, but even so I learned exactly nothing from this book that I could not have guessed at from first principles."
1,Save your money!!!,"The worst MP3 player I've ever owned, and believe me I do have a few. Save your money and get something else. It can not play most MP3 formats, the keypad is not responsive at all and the sound quality is terrible. I returned it after a week."
1,DON'T BUY THIS P.O.S.!,-WEAKEST PLAYER ON THE MARKET-BUTCHERED THE QUALITY OF MY MP3S-RADIO IS WEAK-BAD SOFTWARE-SPELLING ERRORS AND POOR GRAMMAR IN MANUALBUY ANYTHING ELSE
1,Nice functionality but extremely poor quality,"I actually bought two of these units about two weeks apart. BOTH units experienced the headphone jack problem described by the reviewer below. The first unit was sent back, and I had the same problems described below - the entire process took EIGHT WEEKS and a lot of phone calls on my part due to lack of response from Digitalway. The second unit broke about day 130 - ten days after the warranty expired. They refused to honor the warranty period despite my explanation that I had the same problem on another unit and I was only 10 days out from the expiration date. They wanted [$] plus shipping to fix their defect, so I took it apart and fixed it myself in less than an hour - virtually no solder on any of the connections. Terrible design and customer service. Shame on you, Digitalway. Too bad, the unit sounds nice when it works."
1,very bad.. pain in the neck,HiThis is one of the worst product. First of all it does not have all the features. Navigation is very hard. Does not play all mp3 formats and cannot figure which ones.. think twice before buying.
3,Good MP3 Player - until it breaks!,"This MP3 player is a sweet deal for less than $50. The radio works pretty good and storage with a 128 mb smart media card is over 60 songs - which is very nice. However, this product has a history of breaking. I found out the hard way that the earphone connection port has a tendency of breaking off inside the player. The problem, as several other reviewers correctly stated, is some faulty soldering. Thanks to those reviewers I was able to correct the problem with a few drops of solder, no thanks to Digitalway. I tried to contact them numerous times and received no response. I finally emailed them and told them I would never buy any one of their products again - which I won't - and of course, they haven't responded to that email either. Buyer beware, the product has a history of breaking, buy it knowing that this could happen. For $50 you probably are willing to chance it, just thought you should know before making the purchase. Good luck."
2,NO Firmware,"player will not recognize external media card,since i got it for 43, price i guess is sorta OK.if anyone know the trick to this emailkaiotes@mail.com"
3,Beware,This was a geat player until the earphone connection piece broke off. The sottering was bad and is basically not able to be repaired. I have read this same problem from others-but only after mine broke.
2,Could be a good product if better made,"I received this product a few months back and it was un-useable the day after I got it. [...] I got the new one and was able to use it for a couple of months before the sound went out. I did get it with the $50 rebate and really didn't want to go through an RMA.So, being the tinkerer that I was, I opened up the player to see what was wrong. The headphone jack was not connected in a secure way and two of the three contact points had become disconnected. I'm still working on repairing this myself because I enjoy doing stuff like that.Bottom line, if they spent a little more on better components and designed it a little better, it would be an awsome product. Right now, it barely passes for half-way decent. All the features in the world won't help a defective design."
1,CUSTOMER SUPPORT STINKS!!!,I bought another type of player from digitalway and downloaded a firmware upgrade FROM their website which completely zapped my player. I sent it to them and they informed me they wouldn't be able to repair or replace it. Basically I was just S.O.L.
4,Good Buy,I haven't used the scanner much yet but from what I saw so far it looks like a good one. I did scan some negatives and they came out fine. This looks like a good value.Larry
4,Canon 8400F,"It works fine. Good deal for the price. Resolutiion on 35 mm slide is a bit less than I hoped for, but it is acceptable. It's excellent for scanning larger materials in any mode --- color, gray scale, or black and white. Included software works well. No problem installing it on an XP computer. Easy to use. On the whole, I'm very happy with it."
1,POC,"It's great when it works. Just can't get one that keeps working 5 months later. My assistant bought one a year ago. 5 months after purchase it simply won't turn on. It gets replaced and works fine. Thinking this is just a quirk, I buy one myself. Sure enough, I go to use mine 4 months later (after about 10-12 uses total in that time) and it won't turn on at all.Pass on this one."
3,"Good quality scans, but.....","The scanner worked fine for about a month, producing good looking scans as advertised. However, after 10-15 uses the ON/OFF switch did not power up the unit any more. The local Canon service lab replaced the entire scanner due to the faulty switch. It appears that some other reviewers on this web site experienced the same issue."
5,Canon CanoScan 8400F flatbed,"I love this scanner. It has intuitive properties of being able to select what I want to scan, it's is fast and easy to use. The results are clear and it picks up the subtlties of color from the original."
4,"affordable, more than adequate for home use","My only gripe is that the TWAIN interface is a little clunky and the default settings are a bit odd. I would prefer a seperate application (along the lines of Scanwise for Agfa scanners), with more straightforward access to settings like descreening, resolution, etc. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied. Haven't tried scanning any slides/negs yet, but it's nice that it comes with the hardware to do so.)"
3,"Product is good, accessory kit only available in Japan","For a premiere company, Canon sure blew it on the accessory side of this product. On page 13 of their Quick Start Guide, they say you can purchase the Accessory Kit (CSAK-8400F). Good luck. It's only available in Japan. Amazon Japan carries it, but won't ship it to the US. Canon won't sell it in the US. Beats me why Canon would sell a scanner in the US and then not make the Accessory Kit available in the US. Without available replacements for the protective sheet or film guides, which aren't that sturdy, this otherwise very good product rates a max 3 stars for me."
5,Bang for the buck,"Plainly the best scanner you can get for the money for ease of use, quality of scanned image, and incorporated features"
1,Canoscan 8400F not for Windows XP,Scanner installed easily and was a delight for size and style. It worked at first and then went unused for about a week. After that Windows XP would not recognize it. I spent several hours with Dell and with Canon to no avail.I tried to get another one from Amazon but was told that it is no longer available.I did some more research on the internet and decided to try the Canoscan 8600F It installed and was recognized. Results are excellent. I have only had it for a week so I don't know if it will continue to work but I have high hopes.This scanner is about the same footprint and just as stylish. It is however taller.
3,Very Happy and Relieved,"I needed a scanner mostly to download old pictures for a movie project I am working on. I use a Hewlett Packard at work and it works fine, but I needed a step up in quality and speed for all the work I need to do. I bought this scanner based on reader feedback and I have been extremely satisfied and pleasantly surprised with it's speed and quality. Additionally, the ability to scan old slides is a huge bonus for me, (we have about 20 carousels of slides from the sixties I need to scan). The package also came with an Adobe photo software, which was a nice surprise to me. I have had no problems at all with this product. I started using it right away and have scanned about 250 pictures so far. Needless to say I am extremely relieved and happy that I got exactly what I was searching for. I thank those who took the time to write a review, and Amazon for the offer."
1,Twain Error,"Bought this scanner about 14 months ago. Up untill two weeks ago I was fairly satisfied. Now when I try to scan I get a ""Twain data transfer error"" box pop up. I've been back & forth with Canon by email without success. Next step is to call Canon Tech Support directly or go buy another scanner (not Canon). From other reviews I've read, I think I'll be waisting my time calling Canon."
1,worked great.. for a while,"purchased scanner about a 1 1/2 ago. it worked great, although the scanner software was a bit frustrating at times. then one day it just died and will not power up. what a waste."
1,It died right after warranty expired.,"I received this scanner a year ago as a gift and today it is dead. It was barely used, too."
1,The single worst piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned in all my long years,"I hope this review is helpful, here goes: This scanner captures great images. When it feels like it. It works about once out of every 5 times on Windows XP; the other times it gives the same TWAIN error that I'm now reading that people all over the web are having. In the driver's readme.txt file, it notes that this error ""occasionally"" (for me, 80% of the time!) occurs when you have XP and an NTFS hard drive. This scanner cost me hours of headaches and hassles and I wish I could save you the same; I'm replacing it with an Epson and am hoping for the best. No other Canon product gave me these problems, but this is really a ripoff.UPDATE: I just bought an Epson Perfection V100 and it's working like a dream, so far."
5,"Thank You, Canon, for your 8400F Scanner!!","The 8400F scanner is wonderful; it is easy to learn to use and produces excellent scans. It comes with frames for three film sizes: 35mm, slides, and 2.25"" sq. negatives. (I also improvised a frame out of black card stock, which will fit inside the 2.25"" frame, for holding my old 1.5"" sq. negs. and it worked well.) The frames are a bit delicate and need careful handling and are apparently difficult to replace. Other than that, I'd say this scanner is just about perfect, and it also saved me hundreds of dollars in photo reproduction fees!I had well over 100 old black & white 2.25"" and 1.5"" square negatives (and other sizes) to print, which would have cost $3-per-neg. handling, plus reprint fees, at a photo shop. The 8400F Scanner has made my Family Albums photos affordable, beautiful, and very professional-looking."
3,Bigfoot,"Good scanner, though kind of slow. My only real complaint is the extra length this beast has! I don't need the slide scan extras that come with it, but the price was a super deal when I bought it. I figured the extra parts could stay in the box. However, they made this thing with extended length to the case to accomidate the slides features, and it does not sit in the space I have for a scanner. It's only able to scan one 8.5 x 11 inch page at a time, so why does it need 22 inches of length (with cords plugged in)!?! Other than that, it's a good mid-priced model."
5,Review of Canon CanoScan 8400F Flatbed Scanner,"I love this scanner! I am by no means a techno-wiz, but I was able to install the software, connect the scanner, and be up and running very quickly. I does a great job and works fairly quickly too."
3,Canon CanoScan 8400F Flatbed Scanner,"Scan quality on slides, photos and typed documents is excellent. Ease of use is excellent. But there is some compatibility issue with Windows XP. I spent well over an hour with Canon tech support trying to iron out problems to get the scanner to scan documents. I have to go into msconfig and disable something to make it work. Have never had such a problem with any other hardware. That's why I gave it only 3 stars."
5,CanoScan 8400F Flatbed Scanner,I have used the 8400F scanner primarily for scanning and copying 35MM color slides to CDs. It has performed extremely well even though many slides were over 40 years old and the colors had deteriorated. I highly recommend this scanner.
4,Mighty fine scanner this Canon 8400 flatbed,"Set up was quite simple and easy for me. Everything worked right out of the box. I have scanned slides and the image quality is superb. I have also scanned non transparent documents that have resulted in excellent quality.I would recommend this scanner. If you are impatient to wait on the time it takes to scan multiple slides, I suggest you find a different, faster model, but for the price this scanner has been excellent so far. None of the set upproblems that I read about while making my decision on which scanner to buy."
5,CanoScan 8400F is top notch,I ordered the scanner after doing research on the Internet and finding many solid references to the CanoScan 8400F. The purchase price was very competitive at Amazon.com and delivery was quick. The product was what I had expected and it has performed flawlessly. I would recommend the scanner to anyone who needs a home scanner that's easy to use out of the box with minimal setup.
5,Great Product !,I've had my 8400F for 2 weeks and love it.I searched the net for the best of the consumer models and this one is it. My previous scanner was an HP3300c...it always seemed flimsy ; not the Canon. It's solid and works like a charm. I needed to learn quickly to use the software to reduce scan size since 1.5Mb for a page document really was not needed! It has made me happy and I feel it will grow with me.
5,Fast and Reliable Photo Scanner,"I have a Canon FS4000 film scanner that has a slightly higher resolution (3200 vs. 4000 dpi). However, I far prefer to use the new 8400 because it seems like it is about 20x faster. Most of this is the USB 2.0 interface. Most digital printers don't support more than 600-720 dpi right now anyhow so the additional dpi of my film scanner is mostly wasted. Also my film scanner I think was about $800 when I bought it several years ago. So I guess what I am trying to say is that this unit is a great deal for what it does.I have to spend a fair amount of time cleaning hairs off of the surface of the glass of this scanner, but this is something you have to do with any scanner. Other than that, this unit is extremely easy to set up and use. So far, I have been extremely pleased with canon's imaging products!"
4,Easy to use,"The scanner I had was still working, but the adapter I'd need to purchase to connect it to my new computer cost more than it was worth. I'd been wanting some of the features I had read about on the new scanners, too, so decided to spend the money on one. After doing a lot of research online, I kept coming back to this scanner. Although some of the others scanned at a higher resolution, the CanoScan 8400F had consistantly higher reviews. I've thoroughly enjoyed it. It scans quickly and the feature to scan slides is great. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the holders for the slides seem fairly fragile. I've made a special place to store them and will take care not to break them, but it is a concern."
3,48bit color - Not Quite!,Canon's own utility program does not support 48bit color in all modes. Worse yet is you have to enable it because the default is only 8bit per color and that is what most people end up using not knowing any better. Canon should fix their utility program so all modes will allow 48bit color.
5,Canon CanoScan 8400F Flatbed Scanner,Another wonderful Amazon purchase! This scanner is fast and does a great job with every scan. Easy setup- easy to use.
2,Great at first but no longetivity,"I purchased my canon 8400 3 years ago. At first I loved it. I enjoyed its speed and quality of copies. In the last few months, there has been a drastic drop in speed. It takes 3-5 times longer to scan a page. I wish I had only paid $65 for the device. I paid about $300 at the time. I guess it's worth $65 because you'll need to buy a new one in about 3 years."
1,if only i can give less then 1 star,"This machine is worthless! It can scan a 8x11 page of document but nothing more. It cannot even focus on a framed 35mm slide. Even then, you get strange lines across the picture. You may get a readable image from a 6cmx6cm slide without frame. The image you get from scanning slides is so fuzzy, poorly defined, and low in contrast that it is useless no matter how much time you spend on correcting it with photoshop or any photo processor for that matter. Do not buy."
1,Dust in it new,Brand new out of the box it had dust that showed up on ALL my slide scans. I couldn't get rid of it. It's going back.
1,Junk,"After reading all these great reviews, I bought this product on this website for only $99 and thought it was the deal of the year. The scanner came and worked perfect for about a month, then strange things started to happen. First, the lamp scanner would lock in the middle of a scan. Then it started making a very strange grinding noise. Finally, it would not turn on. No power. I could have returned it, gotten it fixed, blah blah. Instead, I threw it away and chalked it up as a loss. I'd recommend another scanner."
2,No film scan on XP,"Should have paid heed to other XP posts here and elsewhere. Scanner will not scan film. While other XP users get a TWAIN error, for me it scans other materials no problem but with film I only get noise or black."
4,Silverado window regulator,"Product was packaged well, which came with instructions that made the install very easy. Worked like a charm and haven't had any problems since. Winter will be the challenging part of the year for this product, thats when the old one went out. The window regulator from Amazon is worth the money!"
2,"Perfect fit, but very slow & noisy","This was a perfect fit for my Silverado, but the window moves noticeably slower than the stock motor I have in the other door. This regulator also makes significantly more noise than the stock one.Slow & Noisy, that's what you'll get...stay with the GM parts!"
4,Dorman 741-644 easy to install,Was very easy to install even with no instructions. Installed it the same day it had arrived and so far no issues. The motor on this fairly quiet. Someone that may not have any knowledge would have some problems however there is also youtube and forums to help guide someone.
4,"Fast delivery, easy install","This part would be a 5 star if only it wasn't the 3rd time in 5 years that I have had to buy it. Fortunately, I still think that I save $$$ by buying it from Amazon and installing it myself. I only wish that it would last longer than 2 years. As for the product itself, it is exactly what you need to fix a broken window regulator in a 2002 Chevrolet Silverado. I admittedly have no automotive repair skills, but I was still able to replace the part in less than 30 minutes. The first time took about 60 minutes.All in all, good product, shipped quickly (arrived 2 days even though I picked standard shipping) only wish that it could last a little longer."
4,SO SO CD,I GOT HTIS FOR ONLY ONE SONG AND THAT WAS ATOMIC DOG.I LOVE THAT SONG .THE OTHER SONGS ARE OKAY BUT NOT WHAT I WANTED IT FOR.
4,Authentic! Features 14 hits and Honesty,"The Best book so far to impress friends, out of the Bruce Springsteen greatest hits or the ultimate Elton John Collection. The Billy Joel Authentic keyboard is to play your favourite songs JUST as the artist recorded them IN KEYBORD obviously though it features guitar chords. The Introductions to most of the songs are exactly the same, best for solo playing and singing isn't very hard at all. Songs Include Allentown And so it Goes Captain Jack Honesty Just the way you are Movin out anthony's song My life New York State of Mind Piano Man Pressure Scenes from an Italian restaurant She's always a woman Streetlife serenader She's got a way The Stranger"
5,Simply AWESOME!,This book is great! The authentic keyboard transcriptions allow you to play just like Billy.Want to play the REAL stuff in Piano Man? Get this book!
1,QUestion,"Why can't you show a SINGLE page from a song with the layout, just an example, not just the TOC or the cover page, seriously? are you that worried about having a transcription stolen? I am not going to purchase this book bc I can't preview it properly to see if it's for me."
5,A must-have for any *true* Billy Joel aspirator.,"""Aspirator"" is not someone that breathes, it's someone that aspires, duh. It's a beautiful book with the REAL notes played - not the watered-down stuff in the Billy Joel ""Complete"" volumes. BUY THIS NOW. You will not regret it. Really."
5,Use this knife every day,"I use this knife for everything. I love the size and the feel. It does everything. It's almost never put away since I use it all the time. Get one, give some as gifts."
5,Akebono EUR688 EURO Ultra-Premium Ceramic Brake Pad Set,"I had heard good responses on the Jaguar forum about these pads but as my jag did not need new pads till now I bought a set all round for my wife's 2007 Jeep GC they are great pads got good feel and stop the jeep really well also my wheels are not black they seem to stay so much cleaner which I like a lot they also seem to be pretty good to the rotors as well hardly a wear at 25,000 k,s I will be using these again and recommending them to my friend that like their wheels to stay clean"
4,"""Another excellent piano performance of Debussy's Music!""","Pascal Roge is my favorite when it comes to playing Debussy's music, but, Ciccolini is a close second for me. With in 2 weeks we played this DVD around 3 or 4 times. I give his soft touch at the keyboard 4 1/2 Star's ! By the way, It didn't hurt that Debussy's compositions are the GREATEST ! ! ! !"
4,Fantastic blend of voices and styles. A must get!,"This recording of the Kansas City Chorale is a wonderful collection of American songs ranging from 20th century Britten to spiritual arrangements that are superbly sung. I have sung many of these songs myself, and will heartily recommend this CD to anyone looking for a choir with tremendous expression, musicality, and tone. This CD has a variety of music that music teachers can use to preview pieces for use in their choirs. It isn't often that you can find an album that has such a combination of styles, and it is refreshing to listen to. If nothing else, purchase this CD for the title piece Fern Hill."

2,Disapointing,"Uninspired singing, poor recording quality, lack of precision and cohesiveness. Great potential with professional choir, but a disappointing result."
1,"Cartoon Globe, Dont Buy It","The Globe has no countries, only continents, no rivers, not even Hawaii (important for American kids), you cant even see the shape of England because of the cartoon of Big Ben over the UK. The information is mainly about animals that live on the continents, and not too interesting facts about them either. The music IS NOT really from the countries of regions its supposed to be from. The globe cannot be rotated to see the South Pole adequately. My daughters first question was 'Where is Germany?' (because we live there) but its not on the globe, then 'Where is Washington?' (where her grandparents live) also not on the globe. My daughter loves globes, maps, time zones, etc but this toy is uninteresting to her and of little educational value. However my 21 month old likes to tough the elephant with the pen to make it roar."
4,Great for young kids,Wonderful for young kids...enough to peak their interest and keep them learning and asking questions. Not to be used as a resource. Gets you involved with the child and the learning process
2,A waste of Money...Just buy the regular model,"This toy identifies the names of the continents and oceans...that's it. There are no individual countries on the globe. The regular Explorer globe for the bigger kids is a much better value for your money. It does cost a bit more, but is worth every penny. My two year old can play and learn with it, and it will serve her well for many years to come.If you are looking for something your child can enjoy for many years to come, your best bet is to avoid this model, and buy the regular Explorer globe."
4,fun geography,"My six-year-old has learned all the continents, plus many countries and a few major cities after playing with this toy (no adult help) in just a few days. I'm impressed!"
5,Awesome Learning Toy,"I bought this toy for my 5 year old son. He loves it and plays with it OFTEN. He spends time alone with the toy listening to the information and truly learning new things. He is always proud to come and tell his father or I the new things he has discovered on his globe. My other sons play with the toy also, and I am EXTREMELY impressed with it's durability. My 2 and 3 year olds have dropped it down the steps, carried it around the house by the pen and it still works ""good as new"". I love this toy and plan to purchase a more age appropriate globe for him over the next several years."
3,Was good to a point,"Susan Wilson did a wonderful job at putting Beauty and the Beast in an realistic light. But may be to realistic. With a fairy tale like this one you always want a happy ending, expectially after so much hardship to begin with. In a way it ended well but not great not how you would expect."
3,Not a bad retelling....,"The best thing that can be said about this modern retelling of Beauty and the Beast is that it is entertaining. the worst is that it is inconsistant. Overall Wilson did a nice job of creating her characters. We know from the begining who will wind up with whome but there's a certain pleasure in watching that happen. I liked that the greatest challenge was not in the ""beauty"" character loving the ""beast"" character, but rather in him allowing himself to accept that love and believe himself worthy of it***spoilers ahead***A lot has been said about this book's ending and I feel that that's where it really falls short. I don't object to an unhappy ending if it serves some purpose or works in the context of the story. My problem here is that Wilson seemed to add a sad epilogue in order to avoid the ""happily ever after"" found in fairy tales, which makes little sense because that's exactly what this is. This ending simply feels tacked on after the ""real"" ending"
3,"Well-written, though not entirely concise...","Wilson has hit home with her adaption of the age-old tale. Modernized, this is her idea of the story about love and loss. It is enjoyable, though it moved almost too quickly and was a bit unbelievable, given the two had only spent one week together to ""bond."" Alix is a true heroine, and everyone who reads the story eventually falls in love with Lee themselves (you simply can't help it). If only real-life love were this uncomplicated!"
3,An ending consistent with the characters/plot is crucial.,"I just started and finished Beauty yesterday. It was an intriquing read until the last 13 pages. It was then that the tenor and the narration of the book changed. A story that could have been romantic and uplifting, instead turned into a poorly written and maudlin tale in which the main characters suddenly lost their character, and the ending lost whatever significance the author had hoped to achieve"
2,Reinforces society's punishment of independent females,"The premise of 'Beauty', a modern re-telling of 'Beauty and the Beast', is innovative, and at first Alix Miller is an interesting character, both as woman and as artist. However, the last 20 pages or so change drastically in tone, transforming this tale of the importance of loving the soul of another, not the physical appearance, into another patriarchal diatribe displaying the extreme consequences a woman suffers for defying society's wisdom. What do Alix and Lee gain? They are both punished for their love, not rewarded for it.'Beauty and the Beast' doesn't necessarily mean that the 'Beast' has to return to a 'normal' apppearance for a happy ending. However, neither should 'Beauty' die for her love of the 'Beast'. I absolutely loved this book until the last twenty pages, when it just made me ill. The message this book sends is quite the antithesis of the whole spirit of 'Beauty and the Beast'. An extreme disappointment."
3,Review of Beauty,"In its own right, this is a lovely story. If you, like me, are buying this novel because it seems similar to Beauty and the Beast, you may want to double think that decision as it does not follow the actual story like of the original Fairy Tale. Also, if you do not like ""adult material"", then I would be cautious. If however, you are looking for a beautiful love story (no pun intended), this is an excellent choice."
2,"Who wants to read a ""fairy tale"" with an UNHAPPY ending?","This book had me right up until the last chapter. Then I went from totally loving it to totally hating it! I loved everything about it (enchanting characters you could empathize with, beautiful descriptions of winter scenes, engaging plot). I thought it had a magical quality, in spite of the modern setting, but then it all went right out the window in the last 13 pages. (I know this was supposed to be a modern, updated telling of the classic, but was the depressing ending REALLY necessary?) If you want to enjoy this book, DON'T read the last chapter, and just pretend they lived happily ever after!"
2,Too depressing,"I tried to like this book, there was the beginning of a good story line. The problem was that she decided to add the last part of the book, and the charctors never really seemed to be passionate about each other. I would not recommend this book if you like happy endings, like I do."
2,This project should have been left to Patricia McKillip,"While I think the premise of the novel is interesting, Susan Wilson's use of language is not powerful or evocative enough to create a sense of atmosphere which tends to be essential in many fairy tales (or powerful romances such as Wuthering Heights). Somehow, this story does not work or give it the power of the fable from which it is derived, perhaps because the majority of the description is limited to reminding the reader how ""modern"" this world is when expressions of feelings, mood and atmoshpere would have been more to the novel's advantage.This project should have been placed in more able hands, namely Patricia McKillip (see her version of Tam Lin in her novel Winter Rose...there is a novel which reeks of atmosphere and mood)."
1,The Stuff That TV Movies are made on,Lovely descriptions but otherwise depressing romance about disfigured Beast and questionable Beauty. Story should have ended before the 'Beast' takes over the narration; this flaws the overall structure of the novel by giving it a convenient rather rushed ending where the main character dies of childbirth and the 'Beast' reaffirms the old saw that 'no man is an island'. Three snores and a beer can!
2,Thin plot needs work.,"Beauty is a novel that bores the reader to tears because the author tries so hard to make you care about these people. Alix and Lee are flat and not well developed. You were left wondering what they saw in each other and why you should care if they lived or died. On a more positive note, Beauty does have lovely descriptions of the winter cold and snow. The reader becomes engaged with Wilson's use of the color blue and of nature. If it were not for the picturesque setting, Beauty would be completely empty."
4,It is fun and easy to with your kids,"My dughter is showing an interest in science, so Santa brought this kit. It was a lot of fun for the two of us to do together."
5,Great for Preschool,I ordered this for my preschool classroom. My kids love science experiments and they are having a great time with each one in this kit. Great!
2,Unamazing,This was rather unamazing to my 8 year old daughter and I. I would have like to have had more information on exactly what the experiments were. It wasn't very expensive so I wasn't upset but I wouldn't recommend this as it was boring.
4,Test Tube Wonders,I bought this for my 6 year old grandson and he loved the experiments! The reason I bought them is because I work as a preschool teacher and have used these Test Tube Wonder Labs before. All the kids are always fasinated with the expriments and want to do them again and again! Great gift!
5,AWSOME!,My kids and I are very impressed with this kit. The kids love the test tubes and all the experiments are separate with easy instructions and no mess!! Going to buy some for birthday gifts for sure as most kids will love these projects and parents too.
2,kids science kits,"I have had these ""test tube in a bag"" kits before and sang their praises. But the one listed I was very disappointed with and would not buy more from this company unless I checked it out. One noticeable thing was how clumsy the test tube holder was, it could easily fall over, their previous stands were solid. The disappearing ink worked poorly. Making the ball was good, but the bubbles were not easy for the girls to use. Growing the jelly like balls was a repeat from another experiment."
5,Science in a tube Rocks!,Bought this set for my girls ages 8 and 6 for hands on science. It is not a in depth learning experience but it is great fun and creates curiosity to find out what else they can do. Think I now have budding chemists on hand. Any tool or toy that helps my girls get excited about learning is a winner in my book.
3,Fair,"Bought this for my 8 year old grandson. Had to help him understand and follow the directions - which I think is the best thing about any game - when an adult and child work together. Two of the experiments didn't really work that well. He was intrigued with the dry sand, the snow, and the dinosaur one."
2,Try something else,Purchased this for my kids two kids who range from 4-7. The kit fail to peak our interests. The test tubes are not sturdy and the experiments are hardly a real teachable moment in the world of science. It is more like a magic show than science. Would not recommend.
3,It's ok....,"Got this for my 11 year old son for Christmas, and he seemed to be pretty bored with it quickly. I agree with one of the previous reviews that a connection should be made between the experiment and real life stuff, otherwise it does feel like magic tricks. For us it was just ok."
2,not worth the money,"My grandson enjoyed this toy,but it could only be used once and several of the experiments didn't work. This was used with adult supervision. Very disappointed."
3,"OK - but lacked ""excitement"" factor","I purchased this for a fun thing to do with my 5 1/2 year old grandson because we had so much fun learning together with the Magic Science Wizard's kit (he loves Harry Potter) ---- It was ok, but lacked some of the WOW factor that I found in another test-tube kit. He didn't want to ""try his own"" experiments like he did with the other one. For my Grandson, the other kit was more interesting for him. The other kit had ""disappearing ink / bubbling water... etc... more Harry Potterish ...Scientific Explorer's The Magic Science Wizard's Kit"
1,"Cute collar, but NOT built well at all","I bought this collar for my 25 lbs. Boston Terrier and within a month of her wearing it I noticed that the buckle came off. Apparently it was not welded and it was not one whole piece like it should have been. I am glad I noticed it before I put the collar back on because I would have lost my dog. The free charm that comes with this collar is very cheap. Within a few days of my dog wearing it, the crystals in it came off. This has nothing to do with the seller, it is the product that is not the best quality. So beware!"
2,"Get a real, used sewing machine instead",Be forewarned - the description on the outside of the box says that the toy sewing machine runs on batteries or an AC adapter. But this item does not come with the AC adapter! You have to buy it separately!
4,How Two Poor Kids Built an Empire,"This is the short and simply-written story of how two poor guys, through hard work and intelligence, created the wine business in the United States. Their lives were the American Dream. The book offers a good lesson for the current generation: work hard, take risks, and good things will happen. Unfortunately, the book reads as if Gallo's lawyers were all over it and that is perhaps its biggest shortcoming. It leaves many questions and details unanswered. It would be fascinating to hear the ""war stories"" of Ernest while he is still alive to tell them. With any luck there will be a sequel."
1,Sleep Inducing,"This is the authorized version, actually justification, of Ernest and Julio Gallo's lives. Ernest busily pats himself on the back while Julio chimes right on schedule like a church bell. Somehow Bruce B. Henderson stayed awake and wrote it all down."
4,"Simple, fun toy!","My son received this for his 3rd birthday, even though the age on the box is older, its perfect for him. The assembly is too hard for him, so if the track comes apart he needs our help to fix it. But this toy wouldn't be much fun for 1 kid, 2 people are needed to make it fun.This looks like the one we got, but ours came with 4 cars. Everything fit together fine, its just if you bump it then parts of the track will disconnect. The cars zoom really fast, so if you put it on the highest level the cars will not stay on the track. But its just a lot of fun, you can even try some of your own Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars to see if they'll work. The cars jump right through the hoop in the gap in the track. Very innovative. It takes up a lot of room for a simple toy, but you can easily disassemble it and reassemble later. We recommend this toy, very fun!"
2,"Great fun, then it breaks...","Our boys LOVED this toy and played with it for over an hour after opening it... then it broke!As we left the room for a meal, one of the two cars bacame caught in the spinning wheels, freezing one of the motors -- and causing it to heat up and break. By the time we were back from breakfast, only half the toy still worked.Our boys were very upset since they liked it so much. We just sent it back for another one... we hope to have better luck next time!"
1,The track pieces didn't fit together,"My husband bought this from the Hamburg, NY Toys R Us. The package was opened. He questioned the cashier about it and she said that if it was on the shelf then whatever it was returned for was fixed. Apparently that's not true. The parts and the empty plastic bags were loosely thrown in the box. Two of the cars were broken. The decals were put on haphazardly and the used decal paper was in the box too. The careless packaging could have been forgiven if the toy actually worked. We discovered why it was returned. The turn pieces don't fit together. This was an early birthday present for my son from my husband because he wont be there on his birthday. Needless to say we were very disappointed."
4,"This is a 1/8"" radius rounding over bit...",This bit does a good job. The cutting edge has a slight shear angle to help it cut smoothly.
1,Weak compilation,"This compilation is one of the least cohesive and least loungy I have ever heard. With all the great artists out there (Thievery Corp/dZihan & Kamien) and great compilations to choose from (Hi-Fi Lounge!), I wish I could send this back. Instead, I have two new coasters."
4,Richard,I received this CD and it was a very good CD. This is great if you like John Tesh. It's worth it to purchase it. ENJOY!
3,pure hymns review,"I was very disappointed in this selection. Not the music; it is a good CD. I am disappointed in the presentation of the product. I searched for christian piano music and this came up. NOWHERE in any explanation or review did it say that it had a band in the background and even a choir. I would not have gotten it had I known that. I was looking for piano music, not a band or choir."
3,Escaflowne en franais!,"Assuming this part of the french dub is the same as the last eight episodes which I own and have viewed, I would have to say that this dub is inferior to the original japanese or english. The french dubbing itself is so-so, and the quality is not as good as one would hope. However, if english or japanese versions of Escaflowne are out of the question, you might as well go ahead and watch it.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this DVD. (FYI: I'm coming from the POV of a french-as-a-second-language student. What do I really know about the french dubbing industry?) Some lines dubbed over made me giggle."
4,Great information for the practical,"Lots of comprehensive, practical information for a serious DIY'er! Most of the more advanced plumbing books are textbooks and code guides aimed at people trying to pass tests, not at people trying to actually build something. This is the book that explained the logic of when to use sweep vs. normal bends, and shows several detailed diagrams of how to arrange specific fittings to drain and vent fixtures in different ways, depending on layout.It could use an update, as it doesn't even mention PEX water supply piping and talks a lot about cast iron DWV. Fortunately, PEX isn't rocket science and a good waste system is the same configuration, no matter what material you choose."
4,Good book -- especially venting,I needed this book to help figure out a complex venting issue and it served the purpose well. Allowed me to avoid hiring a plumber at considerable expense. Would recommmend.
3,Only covers rough.,"Like most Taunton Press books, this one is excellent, but its big drawback is that it only covers rough plumbing, not finish plumbing, so you're forced to buy two books to cover most projects."
2,Badly needs to be updated,"I was very disappointed with this book because it really needs to be updated to include the latest, most common plumbing methods/materials such as the use of PEX tubing. The author does do a good job of explaining the whys and hows of working with the older stuff. But, almost noone uses old iron drain pipe any more and even the use of copper is becoming rare in residential construction. In my area of the country (Southeast), flexible PEX tubing for supply and PVC for waste is used almost exclusively. An update is needed."
3,Great book on infertility,"This was a great book - there are discussion questions at the end of each chapter. The only thing we didn't like was that it was written for women, from a woman's point of view. We read the book together, and my husband felt men were stereotyped as being distant and unfeeling (which he is not). On the whole, the book was a good tool for us to get on the same page and have discussion."
1,Lacks substance,"After seeing Horace perform live many years ago, and listening to his early recordings, I looked forward to reading his insights, and maybe gaining a clue into what made his music magical. I found no insight, but came to realize that to become any better at my own piano playing I would just have to continue practicing. maybe that was all I should have expected to discern from reading this ever so short story."
2,Doesn't Get Down,"Sorry, I have to blast this book. It drags. The man just lists the names of famous folks and his stories sag. There is no drama, no insight, nothing new. If you are looking for something that will enrich his music or give you an insiders view of the jazz scene, this book will not satisfy. I doubt I will ever finish it."
3,Wonderfully Horrible movie,"I knew what I was getting into ordering this movie, and that's why I ordered it. The movie is terrible - campy, cheap and hilarious. The idea of Gary Busey turning into a gun wielding cookie tells you everything you need to know about it.The second one is nothing but salacious drivel. It lost all the campy goodness of the first one and didn't have the solid base of Gary Busey's voice to save it. I turned it off."
2,Dont believe it.,I don't know why it advertises 15 gallon capacity....Its not.It's more like 2.5 GPM. Every thing that could leak did leak.Tore it all out.What a waste of my time.
5,Great one,"This has been working so well for past 7+ years for me. I have been using this to do my taxes for past so many years, that I don't go to any other calculators. I don't even know if Xerox still makes these. As previous reported mentioned, the cover came long back, but this is rugged. I mean real rugged for daily home use, my daughter uses it to correct her homeworks. (not for main use :) )"
1,Eats up AA batteries and REALLY short run time,"1. It was fast until I saw the high quality RC cars and then I got one (high quality RC car) and it seemed like a piece o' junk.2. As in the title, Eats up six AA batteries in a very short time which equals VERY short run time.3. It only goes a slow pace and you have to have a really smooth place to run it on.IN A NUTSHELL IT PERFORMANCE IS TERRIBLE"
5,Nice learning toy.,"My son received this toy at 7 months old and really liked it. He will still play with it from time to time and he is now 20 months old. He really perfected saying bye bye with this toy, because it tells the child bye at the end of playing. This toy is not ment to be used as a pull up toy, for those who thought it was unsturdy,they should try a learning table or something."
3,Disappointing,"My son got such a kick out of this toy - but only because we cheer very loudly when he gets the ball in the hoop. The toy does no cheering, counting or spelling what so ever! So from an educational standpoint - this toy was very disappointing. In order to get the ""frog"" to say the letters or numbers, you have to hold down the knob inside the basket for a really long time. What kid does that? When I purchased this toy, I also bought the Learning Piano and See & Sound Phonic Radio - those toys are great & I'd recommend those over this one any day."
3,Not very durable,"My son received this when he was about 7 months old. He is now 10 months and continually tries to stand up using the hoop as his stabilizer. The problem is that the hoop detaches easily, so when my son pulls on it, the hoop falls and my sons chin hits the base. Although he loves it, I don't believe it is safe for young children."
2,Disappointed,The connection between the base and the post for the hoop has too much play in it. Every time you touch the hoop with any force(much less grab it or yank it like every baby will do to balance and play with it) the board re-sets like you are starting over. I have checked repeatedly and the post is in as far as it will go. Not much help for learning letters and counting. Needs a re-design!!
1,THIS TOY IS DANGEROUS!!!,The hoop on this toy easily pops off. My child actually had to go to the emergency room because of this toy. She was playing with it as it was intended. The hoop came off which made her lose her balance. She then fell and hit her eye on the hoop. She ended up with a NASTY gash in the crease of her eyelid! If she would have hit any lower she could have actually damaged her eye ball! I sent a letter and received no response. Please do not buy this toy!
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Our one year old boy has a blackeye as a result of this toy!As he was playing with it, the hoop fell off and he fell right onto the toy. A week after, he still has the blackeye. We called the company. They didn't tell us it was discontinued, but it seems as if they have received lots of phone calls with the same issue and thus were extremely apologetic. We will return the toy immediately."
5,It was almost an obsession,"Around the time our son started to sit up, he could not get enough of this toy. Like other children, he figured out fast how to reach in and push the button (rather than put the ball in the basket), but he still liked to play with it and loved watching the changing scoreboard. Now, at 15 months, he recognizes and says most numbers 1-10 as well as numerous letters. I'd swear this toy has a lot to do with it.He does get bored with it, but like with any other toy, we just put it somewhere else for a while and then let him ""rediscover"" it. Works every time."
4,my daughter cheats,"This toy is really great. My husband is a high school basketball coach, so we bought it thinking it was only appropriate since she's been in a gym since the age of 3 months. Kaylee loves to put the basket through the hoop and when we clap she just grins. The only problem we have is that by 7 months of age, she had realized all she needs to do to get the toy to count is to stick her hand through the hoop and click the button. We try to encourage her to use the ball, but she'll just crawl to it and stick her hand through the hoop. She thinks it's hilarious. (so do we)"
2,Bought two both disappointing!,"I bought this toy for my son when he was 4 months old. He obviously loved the lights and sounds, however it did not register each time he put the ball in the hoop. Which was not very rewarding-it was not helping him learn cause and effect like I hoped it would. My husband and I loved this toy so much we decided to return it in hopes that we just got a defective one. The second one we got worked for a couple weeks and now it randomly starts over-we can never get all the way to ten or even halfway throught the alphabet. He is now getting to the age, 6 months, of trying to pull up on it and I am terrified to let him use it after seeing others reviews regarding their children falling on it and ending up in the emergency room. It is an awesome idea for a toy but I think it needs a little more work!"
4,JCB Fastrac is great complement to Bruder log truck,"Received the JCB Fastrac 3220 frontloader with log gripper. My 3 year-old grandson loves it. He's one who takes care of his toys and is a big followewr of Mighty Machines. Detail is fantastic, but there are additions like a complicated trailer hitch whih aren't explained. I would recommend this for any Mighty Machine follower."
4,Enter Metzzo,"This is a very pleasing album. The selections are varied, and I really enjoyed most of them. I try to be objective when listening to a piece for the first time, and I was not dissappointed with the music selections I had not heard before. I recommend this album as an alternative to your usual favorites."
4,Great book--terrible cover!,"This is a great addition to the Tall, Dark and Dangerous series. Just try NOT to look at the cover...yuck! I was pleased that the female had a brain and knew how to use it! A bit of a departure from the intrigue but good just the same. Eagerly waiting the next installment...the story of Wes."
4,Very entertaining,"I enjoyed this book very much. I have enjoyed the entire series and while this wasn't my absolute favorite, it was still very good. I especially like how the author give updates about the characters from her other books. Can't wait for the next one."
3,Taylor's Temptation,This book is sure to make feminists around the country scream in frustration. The premise of the story of traveling to a war torn country with the help of a Seal team is too much to believe. The idea of Colleen constantly throwing herself at Bobby Taylor is embarassing at best. Not Suzanne Brockmanns best Seal novel.
1,STEER CLEAR OF THIS SELLER,This is a non-working solar panel. Turned out to be an expensive door stop. Stay far away from these guys!
5,"Love this, our FAVORITE blanket","...and we have a TON of blankets. The minky soft side is soooo yummy soft and the cotton print side is funky and cool. I love that it is not too girly and pink froo-froo and could ultimately be used for a baby boy if we don't have another girl. Great size, washes up well. We get lots of compliments on how cool it is. Highly recommend!"
5,nice product,fit perfect in my 2006 mini cooper s with a nice kenwood deck. fit really flush so it looked factory
5,If you only buy one trance compilation...,"Why settle for two-disc trance collections with 30 songs when you can get this baby (4 cd's, 100 tracks) for the same price? I found this collection when I was in Holland (ie. trance capital of the world!) and it lives up to the ultimate tag! If you have any interest in trance music whatsoever, this collection is a must. Even if it's the only trance compilation you ever buy, it will be enough, there's so much here!Some of the many highlights are ""Back in My Life"" (Alice Deejay), ""Turn Up the Bass"" and ""Sunstorm."" All of the songs are mixed together and are perfect for a party/rave of your own."
3,Limited Applications for this Wire Set,"Using Amazons ""make sure it fits"" tool this item was supposed to work on my 2000 Ford Explorer with 4.0L 6 cylinder. This is the first time that I have experienced the failure of the ""make sure it fits"" tool so I will have to double-check their recommendations from now on.Doing a little more research I found this wire set application is limited to 1989-1991 4 cylinder 2.3L Ford Ranger pickups with DIS (Distributorless Ignition System) using a dual-plug system."
3,Nice sound but disappointing noise reduction,"These cans produce nice big sound from a small source but, compared to the Bose QC3, the active noise reduction isn't good enough. They're lightweight and comfortable but at the expense of a permanent six feet of wire with mid-line battery belt clip. A good first attempt by AKG but the design and noise reduction need some attention -- which explains why you can find them for about $90."
3,Not Happy with the quality of these puzzles,I've bought other puzzles from Melissa & Doug and The Learning Journey. My son loves puzzles but these are his least favorite.
1,Very low quality,"We got these when my kids were moving beyond 48 pieces. The picture was fine and of high interest for boys. But the puzzle was very poorly made. Right out of the box, a few pieces were already peeling apart - picture side from the hard-board or cardboard backing. Also, some pieces were slightly warped and wouldn't lay flat. The $4 puzzles at Walmart and Target are better-made than this junk!"
1,Stretch Away Volleyball Pain,"Poorest product I ever purchased. DVD inside was labeled ""Stretch Away Basketball Pain"" which alerted me right away that there was a problem. After watching for a few minutes I understood that ""strecthing"" exercises are generic exercises that relate to any sport not a particular sport such as volleyball or basketball, etc. in particular. No individual or group exercies, just computer generated images illustrating the exercise. Nothing at all like typical yoga or aerobics DVD that I desired. I note the seller has other DVD's labeled for different sports which I suspect are all just the same DVD with a different title."
1,PAL Region 2 means it won't play in U.S.!!!!!,"I AM NOT pleased that Amazon's website does not SPECIFY plainly that PAL Region 2 means that the DVD WILL NOT PLAY on American machines!!! And, returning the item is a royal frustration if not impossible."
1,Why this plays for some and not for others.,"The discs will not play on my playstation 3 either, but I did some research on the subject. So the problem is not that the blu-ray is region specific. I believe this series is actually suitable for all regions, unless you manged to get one that isn't. Anyway, the problem lies in the disc format. These discs are 1080i/50 which run 25 frames per second, which is cannot be played back on numerous players. Only 1080i/60 (30fps) or 1080p/24 (24 fps) will run on certain players. The list of players that will and will not play these 1080i/50 discs are here:http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1117941scroll down a little bit to the second post to see the list."
2,This Blu-Ray disc wouldn't play,"I was most looking forward to receiving this Blu-Ray Disc. I had previously ordered this through a bookstore (twice) and both times it wouldn't play on my brand new Blu-Ray player. I thought, ""I should have just ordered this from Amazon in the first place."" Guess what, I ordered it twice through them, and twice more, the disc would not play. Amazon was very good at responding back to me the first time I had an issue, and I found it quite easy to return it both times. However, I was disappointed that the manufacturer, or whoever, made this disc unplayable. Just wanted to let others know before they go through the trouble of ordering it."
3,let the buyer beware,"I ordered this and was pleasantly surprised when it was delivered the next day (awesome!) However, to my sad surprise, this disc is not region free as listed in the product description. I am not going to send it back however...I love Richard Armitage so much, I am just going to have to get a region free blue ray player!"
4,It's Region 2 - but TOTALLY worth it.,"Fortunately for me, my computer plays any region of DVD AND I have a region-free portable DVD player, so this DVD worked out fine for me. Entertaining show :)"
2,Can't view this on my Blue-Ray,"I wanted to watch this since I'm a fan of the Cinemax Strike Back series. The Chris Ryan's Strike Back is the original British mini-series.The one I bought was a Region 2 and it doesn't play on most of the machines in the United States.So disappointed. Hopefully someday, the Region 1 version will be abvailable here."
2,Why Are You Selling Region 2 In The USA,Very unhappy that you are selling this DVD series in the USA which happens to be region 1 and not region 2 and not clearly stating in your listing that this DVD will only play in Region 2. In my opinion that is very unethical. Going to contact Amazon and strongly suggest that they make sellers clearly state this in their listings. Why would I buy a DVD I can't play?
3,A good textbook for novice videographers.,"This book is a concise, well organized and inexpensive text for beginning level video production classes as well as a good reference for first time producers and directors. It gives a good overview of lighting, audio, crew positions and responsibilities, studio equipment, concept generation, wardrobe and more.A good, functional teaching tool."
5,The Book of Old Silver,An excellent reference book for all your silver identification. Easy to read and far more comprehensive in information than its competitors. Highly recommended to identify your silver pieces.
5,great book for all american silver marks including coin silver,great book overall for identifying american coin silver marks along with english and pretty much all other countries marks which can be a hard task but this book makes life so much simplier the book to buy to identify old silver
2,too much of nothing,"Talk, talk, talk. So much information about city hallmarks and nothing about purity marks. No way to really identfy general items that a novice collector would have. Is it real or not? Talks about fakes and again nothing about standards of silver and what they are. High brow attitude toward the subject with little or no information on Continental European silver in detail. Too little to late!"
1,Complete waste of money,This book contains 130 pages and if the font size were normal it would have been around 30 pages. I read this book in less than 15 Mins and I have not learned anything new.The book has 5 chapters which basically can be classified in three partsPart 1Explains the Oracle Certification in which can be viewed on the Oracle Web site.Part 2Decorum - How you present yourself at an interviewPart 3Basic questions on OracleEg - what is the password for Scott user and System?- Describe the difference between a procedure and a function- How do you select the date from sqlplus?
1,Waste of paper,A long time ago I purchased a book by Mike Ault and inside there were the same questions he publised in this book - the problem is that a good portions of these questions are completely obsolete by now (like SQLnet v2 or utlbstat/ustat questions) while some answers are wrong (like myths about high hit ratios)!This book should never be published (like almost all the rest of 'Rampant' books). Save your money and get Oracle Interview Questions from the net as these found in this book will not be asked on Oracle job iterviews.
1,Is this a Joke!,"If IT managers need this book, the organization is probably in big trouble. Contains very basic stuff. With smaller fonts this is probably a 50-page white paper. The material is not worth the money.The book costs about $15, do charity with this and get some tax relief.This book is not worth the price."
1,"Over Priced, Poorly Edited","I had to buy this as a text for a course on Africa. It is poorly edited, including basic typos, missing words, and mistaken punctuation. Additionally, there are entire sections that repeat material found earlier in the same chapter.If you're looking for something on your own, get <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Contemporary-Africa-Introductions-Regions/dp/1588264661/sr=1-1/qid=1162422288/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-4093239-7648745?ie=UTF8&s;=books""> this one</a> instead. It is better edited, contains more in depth information (which is reflected in its larger page count), and is considerably cheaper to boot.The African Experience is a big disappointment."
4,Well Made,It fit in my Ponitac grand prix just like the oem works great had in my car going on a little more than a year no problems
1,Contsantly breaks,My car sits more than it is driven and I live in Texas. The plastic wheels in the device melt and break on a regular basis. I am on my 4th set and I have not had working windows in over 1 year. Unfortunately I have not found a working alternative to this Dorman model that won't melt and break.
2,You get what you pay for...,"Well I saved a bunch of money upfront by buying the Dorman replacement - installed it on Sept 14th 2011 and it died on June 26th 2012... Seems like it should've lasted longer than that. I mean if it's only going to last 9 months it's probably worth buying the (overpriced but what're ya gonna do?) GM brand option...I will say, it worked great right up until it didn't and Amazon got the motor to me overnight and I made it through the winter with a working window!"
3,Others miss the point,"This is a ""Tribute"" NOT a ""Cover""!If you're the sort who's tastes are tied to a narrow band of the musical spectrum and you're expecting metal, or something similar, you will probably not like this. If, on the other hand, you're open to a wide variety of music and are fond of skillful acoustic guitar (especially if you've heard Strings of Fire before) you'll likely find this enjoyable whether you're familiar with or a fan of Guns n' Roses, or not.I like Guns n' Roses, personally, but i found this while searching for Strings of Fire and there's some fine work here. It's not fantastic, but giving it 1 star seems pretty narrow minded.It was careless and deceptive of someone to tag this with ""clasic rock"" and ""hard rock and heavy metal"" since it fits neither in any meaningful sense."
1,Axl would be insulted!,"Considering that W. Axl Rose is a lyrically euphonic genius, producing a disc without any of these lyrics makes absolutely no sense. Why take away that which is so important? Is Guns N' Roses actually Guns N' Roses without Axl's vocals? I think not. Nor are they such without the compelling and provacative stringmanship of Slash. Come on now, do you think Axl listens to this for enjoyment in the privacy of his own home? I agree with the music fan who gave the review before mine, why can't anyone get this tribute thing right? I guess no one can do it like AXL!!"
1,maval scientifique pen,"The picture makes it look like it comes with bottle of the hardener, but it does not. The pen seems almost dried out and I don't see any way to refill it."
3,Beautiful but damaged,Tub is beautiful and exactly as advertised.The tub did come with the front lower left corner damaged.The box was fine but the crack on the tub is noticeable.
2,Disappointingly thin view of Bloomsbury,Despite the fact that the late Quentin Bell was a peripheral part of the Bloomsbury circle don't look for this book to be very informative. The mini-bios Bell lays out for the various members are quite shallow and inchoate for the most part and the occasional sprinklings of anecdotal material do not make up for the lack of substance overall which will hardly fill the apetite of the curious. Generally the book is too ambitious in trying to provide meaningful sketches of the lives of several fascinating historical figures each of whom could fill many volumes of interesting reading alone. Nor is any attempt made by Bell to try to help the reader understand the genesis or the historical significance of the Bloomsbury movement. For a reader unacquainted with Bloomsbury who wants an easy somewhat fluffy read maybe...anyone with a real interest in the movement might want to pass.
3,Not Bad,"Movie was done like a video game preview. Cute. Oh and the second guy wasn't lieing the cut outs to the green screen don't always match the actors Arms, faces etc."
3,My Review on Origami Thousand Cranes Kit,"This is really a fun kit but you do need a lot of time on your hands to actually build 1,000 paper cranes. I would like it better if the paper was a little bit bigger, so it would be easier to fold, so if you cannot fold tiny pieces of paper do NOT buy this kit. On the other hand it is fun to put together and a fun way to teach your kids to build origami. Also this kit comes with everything you need to start building!"
4,"Good, but missing colors...","So this was pretty fun but when I decided to put the colors in order of a rainbow (2 papers for each color to make it easier) I found I was missing a couple sheets for one color... some colors had like 5 extra, some had 1 extra, some ran out perfectly... kinda miffed that I ran out of a color of blue but I had plenty extra of the darker blue to help make up for it. Still annoying"
4,Origami Thousand Cranes kit,This kit was great for a project for elementary school students. My only wish is that the size of paper be little bigger. Some students were having hard time folding them because they were so small.
2,Ok But not The best,Like all screen protecters they create so many bubbles and the film glares like mad the bottom line buy somthing like NuShield for a better screen protecter.
3,Nice soft heat,"We purchased this for newborn puppies. I like the fact that it doesn't get too warm for them. It doesn't get very warm at all, but seems to be okay for the puppies to head for when then get a little chilled. My only drawback it that it doesn't have an adjustment setting. Over all it was a good purchase."
5,Salvation!,"This is not the first heated outdoor cat bed we've purchased nor will it be the last! We've bought several this winter season for the feral/homeless cats that live in our garage and while it has not been a very rough winter so far, it is nice to know that not only are the cats out of inclement weather but even when the temperatures drop below freezing, they are much better able to maintain their body heat -- without depleting fat reserves! I see these beds as providing some level of material comfort that maybe makes their lives just a little bit better. Very satisfied."
1,Lousy Customer Service!,"Item arrived non-functional but it took me a month to figure out it didn't heat, so couldn't return it to Amazon. Contacted manufacturer, K&H Manufacturing, received a returns authorization code. Shipped it to the address in their current on-line catalog on their website (a PO Box). Turns out they no longer have the PO Box, never received the package (it was tracked to the PO Box). I emailed them the Amazon receipt, the K&H Manufacturing authorization code and the tracking information yet they are unwilling to replace the item, saying that I need to return the item to their current address. Since I don't have it (it was, after all, delivered to their PO Box and after 5 weeks has not come back to me) that seems to be impossible. Now THAT is customer service! I wouldn't buy any of their products again for the world."
1,poorly represented,product looks totally different in picture and packaging as is actual. Had lots of trouble getting it to work as represented. It never expanded as stated and pictured. Chalking it up to a loss!!!!
3,It was great....at first.,"When the mat first arrived I thought, this is weird, but then after following the instructions for set up, I thought it was pretty cool. Only problem was, after use for about a month, the mat lost it's heat, and the foam pad inside kept shifting, twisting and bunching up. I'm thinking the twisting and such might have caused some problems with the wiring inside and that's why it lost it's heat. Ultimately, I am returning it and probably going to buy one of the hard ""Original Lectro-Kennel"" pads. I have a small one for my rabbit, and even though it's hard, I just toss a little blanket over it and he likes it so hopefully I can toss a thin pad over the hard Lectro-Kennel warming pad and still get a little softness and the warmth too, without the problems."
4,Works as described.,"We expected the warm bed to be a bigger hit with our pug, but he's just as happy in a non-heated bed or chair."
5,Great Product,My cats love these pads! I picked this one as it has a metal wiring around the cord! I have one cat that chews everything and feel safer with the metal. The ones rated for indoors don't have the metal on the cord.
3,This is a heated air matress,"The bed is okay. First off, the bottom is always a lot more warm than the top, which seems rather silly to me. The bottom has the cord attached along with a plastic air valve. As it is an air matress, it makes a crinkly sound when my dog steps on it, which I find to be rather annoying, and some pets may find offsetting. The pad is thin and despite the ""soft"" in the title, it isn't. I ended up having to put a soft dog bed underneath the ""bed"" so that my great dane would use it.In short: this isn't a bed, it's a heating pad that is insulated by a small amount of air so that it doesn't have to use as much power. If you're looking for something that your animal will find super comfortable, this probably isn't it."
3,Not for doggies who like to chew!,"This seemed like a great bed to put in the dog house for the cold winter months. But two days after we placed it into the dog house, it had been torn to shreds by our enthusiastic puppy (7 months old) who thankfully was NOT electrocuted. I wish I would have ordered a hard kennel mat but now that I'm out the money, I think the puppy is going to have to wait for awhile. I gave the item 3 stars because I don't think it's the products fault for the puppy chewing it up, but maybe the material could be more tear resistant?"
1,buyer beware,This item is not effective at all for a small animal enclosure. Bought it to keep a cpl outside cats warm this winter. Temp here is only 35 degrees and this thing was just as cool as outside air temp
3,Smaller then I thought,The heated dog bed is smaller then I thought. The cover that comes with it easily falls off when my dog adjusts his bed. I do think that it keeps him warm in my unheated garage on the cold MN days! I think this would be a good thing to have inside or out for an older arthritic dog too.
2,I guess K&H don't have mud or dirt.,"I bought this for my arthritic old lab. He is an un-neutered stray who pees on anything vertical otherwise he'd be an inside dog. This 'soft','outdoor' heated bed finally expands to a non-supportive 11/2 inches. The cover for this 'outside' bed is off-white fleece(!), secured at each end with a shallow flap. It does get warm.But it provides no cushioning for the dog, the cover slips off whenever he moves and a white fleece cover might be appropriate in the desert, but outside, in the quagmire of an Oregon winter - come on!I finally found a use for it under the full cover of a thick foam dog bed, otherwise it would be useless."
1,Does Not Work,"We have a 15 year old German Shepard who has become incontenent and is now an outside dog. It is winter here and we wanted our faithful companion of many years to be warm and comfortable outside. The K&H Lector-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed seemed the perfect solution. Unfortunately, the bed did not perform as advertised. In fact, there was no heat generated at all by the pad. I perfomed tests with a very acuate thermometer (good to + or - 0.2 degrees F). I placed the thermometer between a blanket on the outdoor doghouse floor and the pad. After an hour there was no increase in temperature. I placed a 50 lb weight on the the bed to simulate the weight of the dog. Again, after an hour, there was no increase in temperature. I then repackaged the bed and returned it to Amazon per their return instructions."
3,Bed or play toy,"I'm not sure if this is a bed ( K&H; Lectro soft heated outdoor bed )or a toy. We had a puppy adopt us, of course my wife fed it so it stuck around. Being animal lovers and not wanting this pup to get to cold we bought a dog house and the heated bed. As soon as this dog eats it starts chewing everything in sight, including the bed. we make up the dog house at night now and take it out in the morning. This dog wont come out of the dog house when its cold and I dont blame it. The way we make it up is the heater goes in the back and the blanket in front. He loves it.North Carolina Dog Lover."
4,Pet cage warmer,"Item works great, our dog took to it right away. Would like an on/off switch on the cord. The cover is a bit flimsy and the plastic backing has already come undone on one end from the dog moving it about. This is the only weakness in the product to date (1 month). Would definitely go with this product despite the one issue.Bob in New Jersey"
3,it works ok,i purchased this for my small dog a corgie fox terrior for his dog house outside. I touched the pad and it's luke warm and doesn't seem to be really putting off that much heat. I think he enjoys the pad though b/c it's cold outside and he lays on it inside the dog house eventhough he does have a pet bed in there as well. From all the reviews read i thought it would be alot warmer. The cover that comes with it is pretty much worthless it easily tears.
5,Old Dogs Can Learn New Tricks,"I bought this for my daughters boyfriend 3 year old Lab. We live in Arkansas and he is an outside dog. I was afraid that he wouldn't get the hang of using it, but the first time we plugged it and called him into the dog house he layed down it warmed up and the next day they found him laying in it. My daughter has a very prissy Maltese who enjoys it as well. Great gift to give my ""granddogs""."
2,Read this before purchasing.,"I always read reviews before I make a purchase. All the reviews for this heated dog bed were pretty decent reviews. I honestly do regret this purchase. It does not get warm at all. I have two Basset Hounds that are outside year round. They have a regular bed and when I placed the heated one outside, they would not even lay on it. It is not thick, or comfortable in anyway. I would not make this purchase if it were for an outside animal that will be in pretty low temperatures."
4,Good product,Our outdoor cats are getting old and my husband felt so bad for them on cold cold nights. They love these warming pads! The price is a bit expensive though.
4,warm!!,"Middle aged stubborn kitty who insists on sleeping outside in the cold carport, appears to love this bed.I started out with a regular heating pad - they get too hot and turn off automatically. This one only heats when thekitty is on it and does not need to be turned off and on."
5,heated pet bed,"this heated pad is soft, outside cats love it will keep them warm all winter long. excellent buy. i own two of these."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,I would leave no stars but that is not an option. It is so thin that there might as well not be called a bed. Not worth $20 let alone $82. You would be better off buying a $10 heating pad at the store and put it on a real dog bed.
4,3 years and it still works,"I use this in a ""cat house"" on our porch in winter. We have a formerly feral neighborhood cat that we had spayed. She's very sweet but will only be inside very short periods before she starts to panic. I wanted her to be warm on cold nights. It still works three years later as long as my teenager doesn't unplug it to plug in his amp for practice! I'd give it 5 stars if it was just a bit warmer. It really just takes a bit of the chill off but combined with her body heat she seems just fine. It was a good purchase and I would buy another if it stopped working."
1,Not nearly enough warmth for puppies :(,Bought this for a litter of puppies and the heat is so low that I couldn't even tell it was on. Also the fleece cover easily comes off and is of no use. Look for another heat source for your pets.
5,GREAT KITTY BED WARMER,"I have this heated pad in my kitty house it is big enough for 2 full size cats to fit at the same time. Works great, fuzzy and warm cats."
4,H&H Lectro-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed,"Goes wonderfully well with the Cozy Cottage Dog House. Our dog is quite comfortable staying in the dog house doing rainstorms, cool or cold weather, She seems to prefer to be outside instead of inside most of the time. There have been no problems with either the plug or the pad itself."
5,Cats Meow,Tommie my ferrel cat loves it. He brings his girlfriend over and they cuddle. Yes he is fixed their relatonship is just platonic. I think. Anyway it is life saver for him in the winter
2,Apparently this mat is delicious,"Our dog demolished this mat within 24 hours of it bring in his house. The top cover is super flimsy and doesn't stay on. Not something I'd recommend purchasing, unless you have a very small, toothless dog."
2,Quality control issues,"Had it for a year and while it worked the cat loved it. It is located in a sheltered area on our front porch. Does not directly see the elements other than cold. After one year it is dead. After re-reading some of the other reviews I remember my trepidation over buying this product but gave it a try anyway. Looks like no quality control and the lack of response to the buzzing noise comments made from other users has me concerned about replacing with product from this manufacturer. I will look around before I do anything, and I guess the cat gets some nice over-nighters in the garage instead of the porch. Anyway, be careful with this item. Looks to me like a company that doesn't really care too much about their products."
5,My cats love it.,"Recently had to put my 3 cats out in the garage/back yard, this heated pad has helped tremendously in getting them better acclimated to being outdoors."
5,Absolutely perfect!,"I've had this bed for 4 months and I could not be happier! I have a small Jack Russell Terrier who likes to be with me in the garage where I work, he was always shivering even when I covered him with a blanket! I bought this bed and he adores it! I even purchased a small dog bed like this one:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZYF1LG/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00I then slipped the heated pad into the cover of the dog bed (on top of the padding) and then ran the cord through a small opening I cut into the back of the bed and now my dog lounges in ultimate heated comfort! I would recommend this product to all of my friends, in fact I already have!"
4,Kitty Warmer,"It seemed to do the job, but you can't really feel the warmth when you put your hand on it."
4,Heated Kitty Bed,"There are 2 outside cats who have been hanging around my house since the summer. They don't want to come inside so this is perfect for them. I have it ""under cover"" so it is easy access for them. They spend a lot of time during the cold weather using the heated blanket. I have felt it myself and, while it's not hot, it certainly is warm; perfect temperature for them."
1,quit working,Bought a K and H model 003 which quit working after two winters. I am very disappointed with that fact and that I have to spend the time and more $ in finding a replacement that is 1) not made by K and H and 2) not made or assembled in China. Two winters is not enough at any price.
1,short life time,"Exactly one year after I purchased this dog pad, it stopped heating. Guess that's why they have a one year warranty. Going to look for a pad with a longer warranty."
1,"If your dog has teeth, consider this a ballon","It didn't inflate or heat correctly. If your dog has a pulse and teeth, consider the hard Lectro Bed instead."
4,worked just fine,I got this for a Boston Terrier. She got bored and chewed on the cord! Very scary! It seemed to provide a good amount of heat without being too hot. Had to send to my dad for his Minpin because I did not want to come home to a dead dog.
5,Love it!,I have a porch kitty. I also have 3 indoor cats that started out as porch kitties but have all moved in when I became concerned about cold weather so this bed was a dream come true! This way I don't have to worry about my porch kitty or my family disowning me for moving in another animal. The best part of this bed (besides the heat) is the price. A large pet store in my area had a similar one for $100 so I was able to save big with this product.
5,Good,"This is a very nice bed, padded cord and washable also good. It could be a little bit warmer temperature wise for this area."
5,Cat loves it,Bought this for the cold garage our cat to sleep on in the winter. When it's below freezing outside it's about 40 in the garage and the bed is toasty after the cat is on it. good buy
3,didnt last long,"We bought this for our ""outside dog"". She loves being outside when its hot and when its cold....whines when we bring her in.So we bought this hoping to make her huge dog house just a bit warmer. She got to use it for 2 months before it just stopped working. I would not recommend this item!"
1,Doesn't really work,I can't feel the warmth with my hands or feet. My dog prefers a rag. Doesn't seem to get as hot as it's susposed to.
4,Warm Bed for my Little Sweetheart,"This bed is a self inflating air mattress with warming coils. It has a thin cover that overlaps the underside on each end by about 2"". The instructions state that you should not put a blanket on the pad, but my little guy likes to scrunch his blanket and create a place to rest his head. I had him sleep on it bare the first night and he didn't seem too happy so I put his lightweight small polartec blanket on it the second night and I think he has figured out that when he lays down it gets warm. I would have liked to found a doggie bed that warms, but didn't see one. I am happy to have something to keep him warm at night in the house. I don't think this would be warm enough for outside use or for a dog that chews on things. The ""small"" size I bought is just right for my 5lb Chihuahua. It would have gotten 5 stars if the cover was much thicker."
4,2 Years - Works Well,"We bought this bed a couple of years ago for our dog who stays outside while we're at work during the day. He loves the bed as we always find him laying on it during cold evenings as we arrive home. The bed only warms when the dog lays on it, saving energy. The cover, however, is fairly flimsy and he tore it off ""making his bed"" or scratching at it as some dogs do. Also, the large isn't that big so be advised that some of the larger breeds (over 100 lbs) should probably get something bigger."
1,Where's the heat?!,"This blanket is so not-warm, that I sent the first one back because I thought it was broken! The replacement is just as bad as the first blanket. My dog actually perfers her old bed to this blanket, and she is a warmth lover (sits on the heat registers when the furnace kicks on)."
1,dissapointed,I got this item for a cat who stays in our barn outdoors. I had a heating pad that worked well and didn't have auto-shutoff. When the heating pad went out I couldn't find another one without auto-shutoff so I purchased this item. It didn't get warm and it was cold to the touch so he never used it. I finally found a heating pad at a medical supply store without auto-shutoff for 17$ and it works great.
1,Heated Lectro-soft outdoor bed,"On Nov 1st I ordered my K&H; 1080 Lectro-Soft Heated outdoor bed. I received it on the 6th and set it up in the doghouse. Within 10 minuts my dog had pulled the slip cover off and turned the corner over enough to chew the red air valve. I contacted K&H; to see about exchanging the product as I didn't even have a chance to see if it worked. They refused to make the exchange or give a refund claiming it wasn't a product defect even though they had the where with all to place a metal wrap around the cord to keep animals from chewing. The slip cover is thin and barely covers the mat and the air valve is on the same end as the power cord which is facing towards the front of the dog house making it an easier target to have the ends turned up and reachable for a curious dog. If you buy this product I would place some duct tape over the air valve area and put a pillow case over the whole mat for protection.K&H; 1070 Lectro-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed, med"
1,Doesn't Work - and Amazon Writeup Didn't Say It Was an AirBed,"When I ordered this ""Lectro-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed"", nothing in the writeup said it was an inflatable bed. Nonetheless, I'd bought it so I figured I'd give it a try for our outdoor cats. Problem is, the instructions are confusing (do I let the air *out* while trying to inflate? Really?!?) - worse, that doesn't matter because it never inflates or heats up anyway!I'm returning this, and getting the outdoor cats a *proper* heated pad...."
5,Warm Kittens,"So far so good !My brother recently found 2 kittens on his property and he knew if he did not take care of them the harsh Indiana winters would be the end of them.The kittens are now healthy, happy, well fed and have a warm heated bed in the extra garage. The product works as described and the kittens stretch out the full length and purr themselves to sleep. I hope the product continues to perform, the winter is just beginning!"
4,My Cat Loved the Heated Outdoor Bed Immediately,"My 13-year-old cat took to the Lectro Soft Outdoor Bed as soon as I placed him on it. After a day or two with it on my covered front porch, I moved it inside his kitty house on that same porch--a kitty house he generally avoided in the past. Now he's in it all the time! (I also created an area with straw toward the front of his kitty house, but he chooses to nestle behind the straw on the heated bed that rests on the flat bottom of the house.)"
2,Bed did not heat up,"I purchased this bed for my outdoor dog expecting it to warm up to compensate for temperatures in the 20s and 30s. We have had several days in the 40s and the bed is not warming up outside. I placed a pillow over the bed as directed to simulate my dog laying on it but when I removed the pillow, the bed was cooler than my hand temperature. Cannot recommend for outdoor use. good thing amazon takes returns."
3,50/50,"I bought 2 beds for my outdoor dogs. One of the units is working great and the dogs seem to love it. The other bed was destroyed within 1 week. My dogs are older and not destructive but the bed couldn't hold up to 1 week of use. Unfortunately I was being proactive and bought these beds in November and when I went to use them in February and 1 was so quickly destroyed, the 30 day warranty was over. I would recommend this product for cats or very old arthritic dogs but not for adult dogs who like to scratch at their bed before turning 3 times then lying down."
4,Outdoor/farm dogs loved it!,"I purchased one of these two years ago, and it was damaged by a puppy (our fault) so I had to throw it away. It worked wonderfully for two winters here in the midwest. Our dogs barely wanted to come out of their insulated dog house after sleeping all night on this thing! Now I don't have to worry that they are suffering in the cold, and truly have a warm place to go if they like. The cord was well covered with a wire 'sprial' to prevent chewing. I would not recommend it for young dogs- as it is easily destructible. An all-around great product for the price!"
5,Keep ypur pet warm,"My cats must sty out of the house because of my allergies. It can get well below freezing, and little houses alone left them cold. These heated pads do the trick! When a cat comes out of the house, its fur is warm and cozy. The pads last, too. I have had one pair for three years. No problems.K&H; 1070 Lectro-Soft Heated Outdoor Bed, Small"
3,Heated outdoor pad medium,"This is not that great, my stray doesn't use it much, have it in my garage inside a box, but it doesn't really get very warm. Kind of a waste, not sure I can recommend it for extremely cold weather."
4,My cats seem to like it.,My cats live out on an unheated sun porch. I set up some boxes with the pad in the bottom and the only time they come out of it is to eat or use the litter box. They seem very happy. I know some other reviewers think they don't work because it doesn't seem to feel to the touch but the pad doesn't heat up until pressure is applied to it. Very good purchase.
4,Heating pad for cat,"Love the heating pad, however I wish it got warmer so to be more comfortable for our cat in the colder weather. Recommend this product for warmer climate states that do not get below freezing."
3,Gets warm... but just barely warm,"This was purchased for a cat that must stay outside. She has a wooden house with light bulb mounted inside for additional warmth. It is warm, but just barely warm. Animals do not need temperatures as warm as humans, but it is just barely warm to the touch. But with that said, she rarely leaves it on a cold day. It must be fine with her."
2,Little Interest,I do not know if it is the product or my cat but he would have nothing to do with this bed. I would have returned the bed except for the reduction in the purchase price plus a 15% restocking fee plus the return shipping charge so I guess it will just go in the closet.
1,Doesn't heat. Stays cold outdoors.,"After reading the reviews I was skeptical that the item didn't heat very well. I figured it would heat enough to at least feel it and therefore be somewhat comfortable for my small dog; but this product is plain garbage! After plugging it in indoors to make sure it worked you could barely feel the heat on your hand. I plugged it in outside for my dog and came out in the morning to feel it and it was cold as ice! At first I thought my electrical outlet was bad but I checked to find everything on my end was working properly. This ""heated"" pad stays so cold in fact that if it snows on it the snow wont even melt! I tried removing the sheepskin cover to see if it made it warmer but the fact remains it doesn't heat and is a worthless product. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!"
1,Not warm enough,Not warm enough. I bought this item so my cat won't start sleeping on my labtop again while I'm using it. But it is just not warm enough. My cat still like to sleep on my computer.
3,Misleading Specifications,Just received my cat's KH-1070 Lectro Soft Outdoor Bed-Small from Amazon. Amazon's listed spects says it (Approximately 40 Watts). The box I received says it only 20 Watts. HELLO>>> This is (HALF) the rated product that I payed for. I feel I've been cheated and miss lead from Amazon's sight. Don Barbee
3,Cheap and mismatch,"Even if the wood is beautiful, the workmanship is not: cheap golden bolts which need to be tighten, sharp cutting angles which need to be sanded and the worst: all the chairs are not the same: 3 are slighty higher and some armrest angles are different. Package was poorly made and some feet needed to be files and sanded to look nice again. we will not buy this again!"
2,Weak Construction,I have had four of these chairs for about a year now. They are cheaply made and wobble. I am giving them away to a friend and buying cast aluminum outdoor furniture.
1,GREAT BOOK; HORRIBLE EDITION,"Jane Austin fans will love this book, too, but don't read this edition. We are asked to ""forgive any missing and extraneous characters"" but this book is almost impossible (or should I say impoffible) to read. Here is an example: ""Her difpofition v;ti,.r/.!iM:t in'finGerity,..."" (pg 67). I'm actually struggling through it as an exercise for my brain, but I've ordered a copy from another pubisher. The origianal book was published it several volumes and this is only Vol. 1."
2,Broke Twice in Two Years,"When it worked, it was great.When it worked.First, like in other reviews, one day it just died. Luckily, it was under warranty and Samsung did fix it. They said the motherboard got fried, but all I did was charge it...?Then, over the past few months, the screen started to get dimmer and dimmer, so that I can't watch any dark scenes at all in a normally-lit room. Trying to watch Sin City was like listening to a radio show with occasional white flashes on the screen.Finally, tonight, the thing just died again. Since it isn't covered by the warranty anymore, this time it goes in the trash."
1,same as the others,I too bought mine a year and three months ago. It was working great and then all of sudden stoped working and will not turn on or charge. I bought this refurbished agreed to pay extra for a extended four year warranty but will see what comes of that. My suggestion is buy the longest warranty possible for any of these portable dvd players as i have heard of problems with many different brands.
1,poor display,This is an expensive (comparatively) DVD player and the large display would have been great - if you could see it. The picture is so dark that you spend the whole time tilting the whole thing this way and that to try to get the best angle for viewing. Many scenes are just not watchable.
5,Best Unit I have used,"I have had several portable DVD players, I always opted for the cheapest and got what I paid for. This unit has excellent sound, great battery life at least 6 hours, resolution is very good and you can set the screen for wide screen or square format. Also works very well plugged into the TV to show videos and has a full function remote control. Most of the time it is used I'm in a place that I can plug into the wall or use a 12V power plug. I highly recommend this unit."
2,A review of Marie Marten's Deliver Us From Evil,"The book follows two brothers, Juan and Jose Rodriquez and their maturing in Columbia, a country plagued with cocaine as one of it's cash crops. The author took on a challenge by attempting to write about the Columbian culture. Some descriptive scenes in the book seem realistic, but there are a couple of other scenes that could better be described as ""fairy tales"". An example: Page 326 describes a person with scuba gear confronting a shark and getting the shark to flee by shoving a whole bag of cocaine (that had been under water for a year) in the mouth of the shark and then pulling out his hand before losing any fingers or arms. The story line is not that bad but the individual sub plots don't go into a great deal of detail, suggesting the author's limited knowledge of what is trying to be conveyed. The most aggregious aspect of the whole book is the numerous typo's and poor proofing that was evident."
1,Messed up download,"Downloaded only seven of the songs due to download #8 freezing my computer. The first review was right! Buyer beware.I am re-editing now this review after contacting customer service. They allowed me to redownload the album free of charge! Kudos to Amazon! The rating should be now changed to four stars, but I'm unable to change it, as the editing software only allows me to add these words I'm typing but not change my previous star rating."
5,Wonderful anthology of Brazilian writers.,"It's a pleasure to teach the classics of Brazilian literature with this excellent collection of Brazilian poetry, theater, stories, novels, etc. ""A Literature Brasileira Através dos Textos"" contains writings by Machado de Assis, Aluísio Azevedo, Monteiro Lobato, Rubem Fonseca, Jorge Amado, Moacyr Scliar, Lygia Fagundes Telles, Graciliano Ramos, Raquel de Queirós, Vinicius de Morais and many others.Esta é uma antologia de textos literários representativos dos principais autores e das várias fases históricas da literatura brasileira.For more Brazilian books, check out Atlantico Books!"
3,A litte something missing ...,"It is an ok product. But could be better. For one thing, it is too short and the extensions are not that long. The handle coul have been flat. It slants upwards which make it hard of for the kid to hold onto. Also could have used a bar attaching both handles for another holding option. I had to make one myself."
5,Review,"Tom Cruise's best feature thus far, cleverly written story, great acting. A classic story focusing on the complexities taking place at the end of the samurai era."
3,Picture and Sound Quality Not Great,"The picture and sound quality of many of the movies in this collection is not great. I sort of expected the movies from the 1930's to not have a great picture or sound, but even the movies in this collection from the late 1940's and 1950's are not much better. I guess the company who created this collection didn't copy the movies from the original master reels but must have used film copies instead."
3,old movies,I happen to like mystery/suspense movies of the past.. Some of the movies are okay. Others not so good. Need more and better old classic movies.
5,Educate children about fiscal responsibility,"DaddyBank: How to Teach Your Child to Handle Money & Avoid Its Pitfalls by Gregory K. Brough (father of three and experienced financial consultant) is an impressively ""parental friendly"" and highly recommended guide written especially to help fathers and mothers to educate their children about fiscal responsibility. In a world where credit card companies encourage excessive spending and hefty interest payments, where inflation goes ever up, and the stock market is as trustworthy as quicksand, young people need now more than ever to learn smart money tactics ranging from the simple process of spending less than one earns, to comprehending how compound interest and financial investment returns work."
3,Just ok -,This album is too average. I cant find a reason to make me hearing this album many times. Its not only the vocals its the music -> there is nothing special than any common metal album release.I like the production (its not like old Judas Priest and its better i can say). just a nice album but nothing more. And yes Halford is better singer. But i have to say that this album is better than Jugulator (i didnt like this album at all)
5,This may not be what you expected!,"This may not be what you expected from Judas Priest and that would be hard to disagree with. This album, hands down rocks the house and if you place this in your ride, you need a sub to get the idea....hold on! I can't believe that anyone would give this anything less than 4 stars unless they're turning country in their listening venue.......I have always put Judas Priest on the top of the list and I am sorry that they didn't record more work with the Ripper Owens, this is straight up killer material and if you disagree so be it, maybe its cause I'm getting older at 40, but I don't thinkso! Buy this you will not be disappointed unless you're in search of strictly Rob Halford vocals or more nostalgic Priest....if you're open minded you will not be disappointed at all!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ouch!,"I am a long time Priest fan who, like many, was anxiously (even after Jugulator) waiting for the new release. Knowing the amount of time they had to put into writing and recording this album, my hopes were cautiously high. It took about 3 seconds to realize the album [...]. The lyrics are weak and amature, almost laughable at times, if it weren't so painful. The patented Downing Tipton dual attack missing,and the production [...] to boot. I had to pull over to the side of the road to fight back the tears, and am sad to say I am embarassed to even use this CD as a coaster. On a positive note, if you are after new Priest material, check out any of the three Primal Fear releases. They, unlike Ripper era Priest, will not disappoint, and show once and for all, Priest made the wrong choice in passing Ralf Scheepers over for the then vacant front man position."
1,Disappointed!,"I have been a Judas Priest freak for many years and I am SO disappointed to say that their new album 'Demolition' is NOTHING like what you are used to hearing from Judas Priest! The album may have one or two reasonable songs on it but, on mass, I think it's rubbish! Ever since Rob Halford left the band and 'Ripper' Owens became the new singer, they have really (in my opinion) gone down hill! They are now sounding like another one of those American dark metal bands. If you are a new Priest fan, then, may I strongly recommend that you buy one of their all time classic albums, like 'British Steel', 'Screaming For Vengeance' or 'Sad Wings Of Destiny'.......These albums are VERY different from 'Demolition', but I can asure you.....YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2,What a shame,"One of the great metal bands of all time gone down in flames. The title may be Demolition but it also Demolished Priest's career. Without Halford there is no chemistry. The production is muddy and the songs are really boring. Glenn Tipton should get Halford back and fast. Buy Halford ""Resurrection"" thats good stuff. Like I said Demolition is such a waste!!!!!"
2,lame,"I couldn't be bothered to continue listening after the first five songs. This CD actually made me reconsider my opinion of Jugulator because Demolition is so much worse. After the first few songs I shrugged, put on Painkiller, and consoled myself with the reminder that I bought this piece of junk secondhand. I'm sure Priest is still a fun show to see live. Maybe they will eek out one last tour with Halford before they get too old."
2,Another disappointment,"Judas Priest is not Judas Priest without Rob Halford, just like Iron Maiden was not Iron Maiden without Bruce Dickinson. 'Nuff said."
2,"At least its better than ""Jugulator""","What happened to Judas Priest? One of the pioneering bands in the metal onslaught that happened years ago is now nothing more than a nostalgia act. The songs are tediously long, and very very cheesy. No disresoect to K.K. Downing and Glen Tipton, but they can't write to save their lives without Rob Halford with them. And don't get me wrong, I love Ripper Owens, I think he's great, but don't be surprised if Rob Halford returns to Judas Priest (a la Bruce Dickinson returning to Iron Maiden), considering how great Halford's latest album was, if he returned to Priest it would time to celebrate. Skip this and get Halford's ""Resurrection"" and ""Live Insurrection"" albums."
3,Not better than Jugulator,"I only like four songs from it. I dont know why some reviewers say that this is better than Jugulator. Although there are some good songs here, none can compare to Bullet Train, Abductors or the greatest: Cathedral Spires. Although this is better than Turbo, or Ram it Down, it doesnt come close to Painkiller, Defenders, Sin After Sin, or Stained Class. I still have to listen to it more, but for now I only give it 3 stars. Demolition in average has better songs, but Jugulator has three that are superior than any on Demolition. Better get the Live in London DVD, the new and the old sound great."
5,metal,I pulled this one out again today after listening to Nostradamus (spelling?) and I was pleasantly surprised. Why do people hate this album? It flows well and the metal is definitely there! Ripper's vocals are on point. It's not Stained Class but come on!
5,'' A VERY GOOD EFFFORT '' ! !,"AFTER REALLY GETTING INTO THE DEBUT CD WITH RIPPER OWENS ON VOCALS , I GOT THEIR NEW RELEASE AS SOON AS IT HIT THE SHELF !I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT HOW HEAVY THEY REMAINED ..EVEN THOUGH SOME SONGS MAY BE CONSIDERED A BIT WEAK , THEY SHOW HOW VERY GOOD THESE GUYS ARE AT WRITING SONGS WITH VARYING STYLES..THE SONGS '' CLOSE TO YOU '' AND '' IN BETWEEN '' SOUND AS IF THEY WERE LEFT OFF THE ALBUM '' POINT OF ENTRY '' .. MOST OF THE SONGS ARE AS HEAVY AS THE MATERIAL ON '' JUGULATOR '' THE SONG '' FEED ON ME '' SHOWS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE PROGRESSED AS A BAND .WHILE NOT EVERY SONG WILL PLEASE HARDCORE PRIEST FANS , THERE IS PLENTY TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED . JUST CHECK OUT '' DEVIL DIGGER '' '' HELL IS HOME '' AND '' BLOODSUCKERS '' !!A CLASSIC RELEASE WITH A WIDE MIXTURE OF METAL UNDERTONES . PRIEST LIVES ON !!!! GET IT NOW ! ! !"
3,IT'S JUST.....ALLRIGHT,"When I heard that Priest were putting out a new cd with Ripper, again, I thought well let's just hope it's better than Jugulator. Well, it is, however, there is only one Priest and that contains the likes of MR. ROB HALFORD. Again, this is an allright cd, a wee bit different than one might think. If you are a die hard priest fan and can remember to the first time you listened to TURBO and thought WHAT!!!! Well, you are kind of thinking that again. The cd does have some good tracks on it with better guitar work on it than on Jugulator. The additional tracks of RAPID FIRE and THE GREEN MANILISHI are just not the same without ROB HALFORD. This version of the MANILISHI is slowed down a bit and just isn't the same. There is a few good songs on this cd such as MACHINE MAN, ONE ON ONE, HELL IS HOME, BLOODSUCKERS, IN BETWEEN, AND METAL MESSIAH. This cd is for one to buy if you are a Priest fan. Maybe, ROB will be back...soon!!!"
1,STILL not the same,"One would think that after the horrid JUGULATOR, Judas Priest would attempt to get back to their roots. Wrong! Like JUNKULATOR, this album suffers from overused guitar, horrid lyrics, and death-inspired titles. ""Bloodsuckers""?, ""Devil Digger""?. Come on, guys you can do better then this! Oh yeah, what's with all the explicit lyrics? Trying to sound like Slayer is not going to earn you any more respect. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens still tries to sound like Rob Halford, but to no avail. I still can't understand why Judas Priest is trying to sound like a thrash metal band....TRASH metal is more like it! I have no idea what Downing and Tipton had in mind, but this is a band that has gone downhill, FAST!"
1,Horrible :(,"The years of anticipation for this album is the biggest let-down in Priest's career. There are no new sounds, catchy riffs, ear-piercing screams or anything else that might make fans want to re-discover Judas Priest. Look to Rob Halford's solo material to see the direction they would have/ should have gone."
1,Almost as bad as Maiden without Dickinson,"The riffs are lame, but not as lame as the vocals! LAME, LAME, LAME... stay away at all costs!"
2,One of Priest's Worst,I just saw priest with the newly reformed Halford at the OC Fair on August 5th and now I understand why after hearing the Live Priest album Meltdown as to why they were bad with Ripper Owens - Halfords voice is a 4+ Octave Voice and that is why he is a LEGEND. He sounded that good even in his younger days.I even got the Live DVD of Meltdown and there is no comparison. Fer cryin' out loud he was in a Priest COVER BAND. His vocal capabilities were not the same.
1,"Sucks, avoid like the plague!","What were they thinking. Priest meets indutrial. Give me a break. I know it's hard to make an album as good as Jugulator, but come on, did Priest forget how to write songs. They all suck. I can only think they purposely made this cd suck so ""Ripper"" Owens would leave and Halford would come back."
3,"Good, but not heavy enough","After Jugulator, I expected Judas to go on a heavier and faster direction. It would be great to have the dark (Defenders)plus the explosive (Painkiller) plus the rage of Jugulator. Instead, this is a step in a different direction. I've been listening to Priest for 22 years and this is for me a strange step, like Turbo (which I am beginning to like). My favorites are Lost and Found, Machine Man, Hell is Home, and Cyberface."
2,I WOULD NOT BE MY LIFE ON IT !!!!,"After the huge dissapointment with JUGULATOR, I was very suspicious about this DEMOLITION. Ripper Owens proved to be a great metal singer, but the new ""Musical orientation"" of the band astonished me, so bad it was !!! Anyway, I listened to this DEMOLITION. Another dissapointment... Anyway. I'll watch their show here in Brazil, in the city of So Paulo, since I've never had the opportunity to see my favourite band alive. I hope they play one song at best from JUGULATOR and DEMOLITION and stick to the old classic."
2,Another Glenn TIpton solo album,"This is what DEMOLITION is all about.We must remember the replacement Ripper Owens is just a hired gun to the band: he does not write even the lyrics (contrary o Halford).It was after his solo album, BAPTISM OF FIRE, that Glenn decided to wave the banner of Judas Priest again. In Demolition, he's credited as producer, as most of the songs are of his authory alone, without even using the famous partnsership of Tipton / Downing.So, Glenn decided to take the band to more ""Modern"" times, designing a new logo, and trying desperately to seem ""aggressive"": lyrics and music, SOmetimes it's trash, sometimes it's nu metal, but almost nowhere we can see a glimpse of the good-old mighty Judas. Even the great lead breaks are missing.As for Ripper, he has great ability, but, like I said before, it's just a hired musician that did not offered any insight to the band.Scott Travis still is one of the best metal drummers of the world, he can't help here. Tipton is the ultimate boss."
5,Demolition Delivers!!!!!,"I know alot of fans don't care for Priest without Halford, but I prefer it. I mean no disrespect to Halford whose contribution is substantial, but I prefer Ripper's voice and range and what he brings to the Priest sound. I really enjoyed Jugulator and this disc is a continuation in a way. It seems they went back to the classic Priest melodies. Aftet the first listen I was intrigued, and after I finished it a second time, I just love it start to finish. Solid songwriting all the way through. Give it a chance, don't just discard without giving it a fair chance. ...."
5,UNDERESTIMATED,"This is one classic Judas Priest CD. This is unerrated like Turbo, Jugulator and Ram it Down. People say that Tipton [stinks] at song writing. Well, it's [bull] he is a fantastic song writer, just listen to the tracks One on One, Jeckel and Hyde, and Machine Man. Don't listen to the negative reviews."
2,What A Travesty!,"Judas Priest with explicit lyrics? My Judas Priest? Blechhh! I guess their trying to be really cool and attract young listeners who like crude, angry music, that just makes my head hurt. Get real people. Ripper may be a lot of things, but a singer like Rob Halford he ain't. There's maybe 5 songs of the 13 tracks that I could stomach listening to. Glen is clearly lost without Rob. These ""ballads""?, ... You'd be better off buying Halford's solo CD which is really good (other than Cyberworld), which Rob should have donated to this effort, as it would have fit right in..."
2,What happened Judas Priest?? :O(,Ok Im a big JP fan but this album has no punch... Its not polished like Painkiller.. I understand JP is trying to stay modern but sometimes modern will hurt you rather then enhance your career. Scott Travis sounds like a different drummer on this album WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SCOTT TRAVIS OF PAINKILLER?? Seriously there is no energy from you this time. I know Ripper may have the same vocal range as Halford but he isnt as clear vocally. Get Halford back and Scott hit harder man.. Get the Painkiller producer back. Do something!
1,Good priest cover band,"Basically, a huge disappointment. I thought the last album was pretty solid, but this one pretty much sucks. A coupl mediocre tracks, otherwise no sense of effort in the songwriting. Audio production is lame also."
4,Terrific machine but not so all inclusive,"This Vaio is a terrific machine whose screen brightness surpasses all the other model of its same level as Compaq 2715, Tosh 5000 and HPzt series. Its major drawbacks are the lack of floppy disk inside (you have to use an USB drive), and the modem is quite cheapy (I had to write an extra string to connect at 50k).Overall performance insuperable, nice design, 3 USB ports, end even a slot for MS of Clie Handheld. Keyboard almost as good as the one of IBM Thinkpad. Sound very good. Should have at least 512mb of RAM. Battery, an acceptable 2:45 h.I would give 4 stars and a half."
4,Dragon SIM-13,A good read realistic and lots of good action the story and character's were very well done I plan on reading more stories by this author.
5,"""A PUSLING TECHNOTHRILLER."" Publishers Weekly","That's just one of the reviews this book received upon publication. ""A NAILBITER IN THE BEST TRADITION OF ADVENTURE FICTION,"" is the rest of the Publishers Weekly summation. ""A DARING RESCUE PRODUCES A CLIMAX WITH ENOUGH SUSPENSE AND ACTION TO SATISFY THE MOST JADED OF THRILLER FANS."" Library Journal raved. The Kirkus review is already posted above. Amazon.com will soon be offering copies of this novel for sale once more beginning mid-September 1998! This is the second book in Bob Mayer's series of novels on Special Forces. Check out SYNBAT, the third book in the series!"
4,A decent read,"I liked the book overall. The writing pace is not as fast paced as I had hoped but true to military type timelines, it may take a bit but you will get to your mission and then the action heats up. I have since sought out other books by Bob Mayer and I have enjoyed them all. Not for everyone but definatelly worth a shot."
4,Good Read!,I'm really into techno-thrillers and this was a good read! Defintely worth the money and the time to read it.
5,Another great story,"This is another great read by Bob Mayer, I have read about 40 of his books and am looking forward to more."
2,Dragon Sim-13,"The Kindle version is full of typos and formatting errors. How does this happen? Overall, you never forget that you're struggling through a mediocre book. It never becomes an experience."
4,great. very important stuff for serious divers to know.,"As an instructor, the most common physical complaints I get questions about concern the ears. All of us, at one time or another, have experienced trouble clearing our ears during a dive, and many of us had that ""full feeling"" follow us around for several days after we have finished diving. Is this an indication of ear damage? Are these symptoms serious? Answers to many of these questions can be found in Underwater Ear and Nose Care by Noel Roydhouse. Written in layman's terms with excellent diagrams and photos, the book demystifies the ear and many of the problems we as divers encounter with it. From how it works, to how it breaks, and how to keep it from doing so, Underwater Ear and Nose Care is a must read for every diver who's ever given his buddy the ""something's wrong"" signal followed by a finger point to the ear."
5,Fine Refining Book,One of the authors showed the book to me. I wish it had been out two years ago. It would have given me a better understanding of ULSD chemistry. Chapters by Mochida and by Song give unexpected detail on new catalysts such as STARS and Nebula.The best way to describe the difference between this book and others is its breadth. It covers a lot of things I didn't know much about. That's going to be a big help to me as a relatively new refinery engineer.
3,"All fine, except for being very close to the expiration date","Hi,it arrived quickly to my address. The only thing that I didn't like is that they sent me a product very close to the expiration date which it is in a couple of months and it was manufactured in 2010.Thank you"
2,Interesting and unusual jelly...,"We bought this jelly as it was recomended on the Dr Oz show as a weight loss tool. I was hesitant to try it. Honestly, I will eat about anything, but this looked like a jar of tar. After giving it a try, I would say it reminds me of the filling in a fig newton. Its not that bad. I am glad I tried it, but it wasn't for me. It was a good price, very large jar for no more than it cost."
5,Great comedy,"Goldblum, Graff, Scott-Thomas all have excellent chemistry. This one will delight!I've been trying to find the soundtrack to this or at least the artist and title of the music with the tingle-ing bells. On my recorded copy the credits are so small and blurry haven't had much luck. And no soundtrack seems available."
5,Smooth Jazz and Great Guitar,"Smooth jazz and great guitar-this CD is awesome. It is one of my favorite CDs to take on the road, and is worthy of my CD collection. ""Afraid of the Silence"" is worth the five stars alone. Doug is indeed a guitar master."
1,Don't torture your baby with this trash,"Baby screamed as soon as I put this vile concoction on her. I peel back the label to discover it has alcohol in it! WTF?! Who puts alcohol in a product meant for irritated baby skin? Thanks, Earth's Best, for hurting Baby and wasting my time and money. If I could give zero stars I would."
2,toddler reaction to cream,We tried this Calendula cream on our 2 year old and within minutes his skin rapidly became very red and blotchy. He has been using California Baby Sensitive Skin cream since birth and has never experienced a reaction. I give the cream 2 stars because it does seem quite moisturizing on adult skin - it was just too strong for our toddler's sensitive skin.
4,Gotta love it at this price,"Bought to replace 15yr old cranks on my MTB that had begun to shift shabbily. This crank restored shifting to like new (as best as I can remember it). Almost bought a set for my touring bike, but it put gearing a tad low.Chainrings are riveted together so you can't replace them individually.Great to have this option of an inexpensive triple to resuscitate an old bike."
4,Very good replacement,"I've had it for a while, and it feels very solid. Its doing its job well.A few gears seem to be chipped, but that might be because of how hard I ride."
2,Frustrating Fix,"After hours of work I am stuck with this upgrade that still doesn't work the way that it should. Starting with the unknown. Did I need to know that there is a specific size for which this crank fits onto????? It seems that there is a hairs difference in the size of the square peg onto which the crank slides. It will not slide all the way into position--about a quarter inch shy of proper position--so that my derailleur can only swing out as far as the middle gear. I have tried several attempts to compress it further using c-clamp and pounding with a two by four, and the bolt that secures it, but neither arm will go any more inward. So now this beautiful black satin finish is all marred up and non-returnable, and I still have no recourse but to take it to the bike shop which defeats the whole purpose of ordering and doing it yourself. This venture is killing my pride. So BEWARE BUYER***THAT YOU CAREFULLY FIT and prepare to send back if it doesn't easily seat into position."
4,Massenet at it's best,"This is an excellent performance by the Vienna State Opera with soprano Edita Gruberova as Manon. Gruberova not only excels in the dazzling coloratura parts, but also in the subtle melodic arias. Her acting as well as that of the tenor Araiza are first rate as is the orchestration. The two principals are not native French speakers but diction is accurate and clear. Visual and sound quality are quite good."
3,Cosmos (Soundtrack),"This CD is ok but if you want to hear-listen to the Real Deal that'll blow your socks off,, I suggest you get/ buy ""The Music of The Cosmos"" DIDITALLY REMASTERED COLLECTOR'S EDITION !! ( Carl Sagan ) You won't be disappointed !! :o)"
4,Finally Carl Sagan's beauties collected on CD,"Soundtrack collection with highly varying styles. These are tracks that Carl Sagan has used in his popular ""Cosmos"" series and, unexpectedly, the different tracks sound incredibly fitting when heard together. Less experimental or renewing than I at first thought, but nice anyway."
2,Not the full soundtrack,"I have the Cosmos soundtrack on vinyl and love it and was expecting the same thing on CD. However, when the CD arrived it was entitled ""Selections from Cosmos"". The CD has only 6 of the 18 cuts on the vinyl soundtrack."
3,Excellent book in an age of fear,Excellent book in a series or spiritually invigorating books. Particulary good in today's age of fear and rampant consumerism.
3,Paradoxically I'm in two minds about this book,"It's a summary but also a mild extension of Peck's previous works (although I have only read two others). I very much like his notion of 'paradox' being central to life and the system of which we are part. His words on the reality of death I found confronting but very sensible and challenging, and felt that this was an important part of the book for me. I found other parts of the book fairly self-indulgent, for example his constant references to his marriage and the mistakes he had made, his descriptions of his foundation (FCE) having to learn about business and the realities of retrenchment etc, and also his poetry. It takes effort to read this book. I would not recommend it to any of my friends, but am glad I pushed on and finished it myself."
3,Good Stuff If You Stick With It and Search For It,This guy gets it in life but his books are hard to read. You have to endure much to retrieve the good stuff in this one. I did and its worth it but tough read. He has the 'piece' when it comes to understanding human nature and people in general. Case studies are good but sometimes overdone. In the end - if you endure and are interested in knowing more about yourself and others - it is worth it.
2,Not a very practical book,"If you like the book The Road Less Traveled, you could be disappointed by this one. This book is just a synopsis of a number of the author's views on various topics like life and organisation without having examined and discussed each topic in detail. However those who like to have a concise guide to some of the Peck's view might find this interesting."
4,Some good tidbits,"For the most part, I like this book because there was something that I wanted to underline in every chapter. It's true that the author keeps referencing previous works and I have absolutely no idea why that goes on and on. That should have all been edited out in my opinion but there are still good things in this book. I personally don't like when Mr Peck refers to God as ""she"" What's with that? Not sure I'll figure that out so I'll just leave it be."
1,"I can't understand Scott Peck's book, especially this one","I read it from cover to cover but I couldn't understand him. I tried hard to get something out of it but his style of writing and use of words is ""away over my head."" This is despite the fact that I have been reasonably educated in that I have an undergraduate degree plus an MBA degree. There is a lot of repetition in the book. I also read ""The Road Less Travelled"" but got a little more of this book. Let it be known that I read non-fictional books every morning. I read about 40 books per year."
1,A let's make some more money with this book,"This is the first book I read of this this author, but I do know there is a title ""The road less traveled"".But based on what I was reading and the title this seems like an attempted sequel to the first book with constant reference again to the first and other books by the author sometimes on a page to page basis is a real turnoff. One perceives the author has nothing new to say."
4,"A powerful book, challenging and confronting","Initially I found the book a little slow and less exiting than ""The Road Less Travelled"" and this disappointed me at first. However it gets better and more confronting. I struggled to keep up my reading pace due to the implications of what the writer touched on. Its not easy to be a 'conscious thinker' as Peck puts it and this brought home the difficulties that I have experienced in my own life. Every person has their own way to avoid being true to themselves.I think that ""The Road Less Travelled"" is a great book to read if you've just started on the journey to mental/spiritual health. ""The Road Less Travelled and Beyond"" is helpful for those who have taken up the challenge of personal growth for some time and are ready for more challenges."
1,I wouldn't suggest this to anyone!,"Having read ""Further Along the Road Less Traveled"", and its predecessor ""The Road Less Traveled"" I had great expectations for this book. I was gravely disappointed, however, to find that it was nothing more than an annotated bibliography (of sorts) of every book that Peck has written to date. It is, simply put, a long advertisement of the author's writing and practice accomplishments. I wouldn't suggest anyone flatter his ego any more by buying this book!"
5,Excellent product,"This sweatshirt, for the price, can't be beat. For someone looking for an extremely useful piece of workout gear, this in the one."
4,A Must-Have for all Musiq Lovers!,"The disc was great. The only drawback is the 'DJ Finesse' in the background of the beginning of each song. Otherwise, I'd give the disc a FIVE star. It's not that noticeable though."
3,Great requiem with poor video,"This is one of the great requiems with 4 great soloists. It was shot in a baroque cathedral of immense beauty. Unfortunately the video at times looks like it was shot through cheesecloth and video is only 65 minutes long. And the skin color of everyone is kind of pasty, With these old videos they should be combined to give the viewer more value. For instance this would have gone quite well with his Mozart's Mass in C also shot in Bavaria."
3,Flying Saucer Attack - 'Goodbye/And Goodbye/Whole Day' (VHF) 3 1/2 stars,"As it turns out,this release is actually an EP.Thought that since the duo worked with New Zealand experimental guitarist/composer Roy Montgomery on this CD,that 'Goodbye...' should be good.It is,but this 3-track effort marks the departure of Rachel Brooks,who was Dave Pearce's(who is,essentially FSA)partner in the band since the start.Each tune is,within itself charming,well played and a bit noisy.Track listing:""Goodbye""(4:48),""And Goodbye""(8:48)-recorded live and ""The Whole Day""(9:58).A decent post-rock/ambient effort."
3,"Good product, quick shipping, but ...","... the case for the CD was badly broken. the CD was OK, and we found an empty CD case to use. Perhaps a little better packaging would avoid this in future."
5,Completely Satisfied,This CD is great. I love the worship and the praise. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a praise or worship cd.
2,Power Filled Living,"I have read a book by this same author on prayer; which was life changing. This book was not. In all honesty, it was just boring and tedious."
3,Good for the type,"This is simply a foam filter that removes most refuse from the water. It stays operational for a fair amount of time considering the volume and number of critters. While other filters are more effective, here you get what you pay for: a simple, easy to clean filter that gets rid of most of the ""yucks""."
5,great filters and reuseable,These are great filters considering how small these are they work quite well. They can be rinsed and used over and over again (rinse with water that has been declorinated and no ammonia) and it acts also as a BIO filter!
5,designing exchange conversations in a new historical style,"Steven's book brings a rich articulation of the social practices innovations unleashed by the Open Source collective: a new understanding of private property that better fit the tech forces and the challenges of the present. His book it is not a model; it is not the list of the 10 reasons why...; it is not the defense of an emerging theory; but an historical account in which anecdotes, facts, historical moment, tentative hypothesis, set the background to allows the reader to reshape her/his own questions. The book gave me a perspective I have been testing with IT architects, programmers, software designers...I feel myself much more prepare to engage in conversations about the future in a meaningful and effective way. Thanks to the author!"
4,Civil rights and music are twin threads in this book.,"A girl discovers her true vocation as a musician as she forms part of a trio one summer. The civil rights thread in this book seems a little forced and dated, but the discovery of music is treated in a marevlous way. If you liked The Mozart Season you will want to try this book. The sequel about the heroine's experiences at music camp is even better."
3,Hmmm...,"So far I've only had time to flip through the book. It looks really interesting. I probably wont be able to make clothes from it, but I know folks who can help me draw patterns from these instructions. I'm not very experienced at sewing."
5,Makes me want to sew even more!!!,"I use this book as a refrence for all of my hopelades and Surcotes, and several of my men's things. I love this book!!"
3,"a useful resource, but not the best","In short, one of the only things I truly enjoyed about this book was the apparent use/artistic copy of actual woodcuts and pictures to display to the reader what the garb of the period looked like."
1,In my most hated pile,"Heavy reading, outdated and it frankly had nothing new to teach me. The fact that I was forced to read it did not help."
5,My all time favorite book,"I was given this book when I was only 16 by a gentlemen that owned an incense stand on Venice Beach. The book is written in the form of letters and short stories in the first person, (from different characters.) My favorite is the story of a beautiful young girl that is painted by Picasso in the Madonna in Hell and later grows up to be used as a baby making machine and concubine/ wife of various men - due to her extrodinary beauty, then discarded. She becomes a harlot and writes her letter is written to her children from a whore house. A unique, empathetic perspective from a man that understands... While not all of his stories are of this nature this one stands out some 14 years later."
1,Da F**k is this???,"For those of you looking to spend your money on a good movie, DON'T BUY THIS ONE!!! The first part of the movie was interesting, but then it was all downhill from there. There is a voodoo premise that was poorly done. Some research would have been helpful, and might have helped the ending make more sense. The plot was extremely predictable. The ""surprise"" ending was lame to say the least. The acting was halfway decent, but it couldn't save the movie. There are vague flashbacks throughout the movie that are supposed to tie everything together, but it holds like thin spaghetti. Bottom line is just nail this one in its coffin and bury it quickly!!!"
1,Disappointment,A perfect example of how a DVD cover can seduce the viewer...what a disappointment!!!Let's hope SAW IV DVD is better than this excuse for a horror flick.
3,I'm surprized,"This movie was alot better then what I thought it would be.I usually don't watch horror movies with a majority black cast because they usually suck,but this one was good..."
4,good backgroud information,"Very detailed biographical information helps you understand where the band members (and others close to the band) come from and how and why they got to where they are now. Unfortunately this book only covers up to the release of Joshua Tree, but its great for information on the real early and formative years of the band. I found that some things were repeated many times throughout the book but at least that made you really remember them well. It was a fun read for a fan who wants to know more."
5,A Brilliant and Compelling Book About The Rock Group U2!!!,"This book is a wonderful look at the band known as U2. Named after a spy plane, this story takes you back to the band's humble beginnings in Dublin, Ireland and how a group of four young boys became one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time!!! It shows what incredible hardships each member had to face growing up, and all the obstacles the band has overcome. This books leads up to the band successful breakthrough album The Joshua Tree, and all the sacrifices the band had to endure to make it to that point. It also tells how Bono(Paul Hewson), and The Edge(David Evans) got dubbed their new names. Bono's name actually came from a hearing aid shop in Dublin called Bono Vox, which is latin for ""good voice."" That moniker seems to fit him perfectly, since he does have a damn good voice!!! Bono ended up giving the edge his name. I can't remember the source for his name, though. I'd better start reading the book again!!!"
2,Not worth the money,"The information in this book can be readily found on the internet. As a consequence, do not buy it."
2,"Stone is fine, chain is cheap.","The stone and setting are fine and as described. The chain, however, is possibly the cheapest and flimsiest feeling chain I've ever had the misfortune of owning. The clasp is tiny and difficult to operate, and it feels like one sharp tug would break the chain. I'll be buying a decent gold chain at a department store to put this pendant on."
5,KREMA = THE BEST,The BEST Tasting Peanut Butter on the market ... Period. The sole ingrediant is Peanuts. How can one go wrong? EXCELLENT!!!!
1,Amazon continues to not properly describe what they are selling.,"I bought this because I am a semi-pro mechanic and always insist on the quality of fel-pro gaskets.This set is all fel-pro except the head gasket, that is some euro brand. This set has the same part # as the local parts store but not the same gaskets. DO NOT BUY IT HERE unless you don't care about the off brand head gasket.FYI, You MUST replace the head bolts on these BMW's and you need special alignment tools for the vanos cam timing."
2,this thing is a waste of money,The only thing that is good is the timer. It trickles out water no matter what you do to adjust it. IT does not build enouph pressure and overall has a cheap feel to it. A $4 spray bottle KO's this thing.
1,not good,"did not work long.i got it home followed the instruction ,it worked for about 5 days, than it quit working.i was very mad,and i will not buy this again."
1,Believe the reviews!,I have a small terrarium with one chameleon so I thought this would be the perfect item for keeping him hydrated - the thing has no water pressure and basically just makes a mess - don't waste your money . . .
1,Watch yourself.,"The item I received leaked, as a matter of fact it leaked all over my digital power strip. Good thing there was no fire. I went online and found that a lot of these items leak. Pissed off I tossed it, wasn't worth the time of trying to get a return, went to order the Zoo Med Fogger (Also Leaks but manageable). No more Zoo Med Products for me. The seller however had the item to me fast."
3,not a mister,"This unit really should not bill itself as a ""mister"". It is a sprayer and not a very ""fine"" one at that. The little motor inside does not build up enough water pressure to disperse a fine mist spray - but, rather shoots a course spray. Depending on how you are using it it can be pretty good, but, if you want a fog or fine mist to cover a large area, this is not for you."
1,Habba Mist Machine,"This unit worked reasonably well for a few weeks, though as noted by other reviewers, it produced more of a slow stream rather than a mist, however after a month or so the motor became louder and louder, and the water stream became more of a drip than a stream, until it became un-usable. The build quality is very poor. I would suggest spending a little more and getting something that will last."
2,better know as...............,"this machine works well if you're trying to replicate a tropical storm in your terrarium. As for a ""misting"" system it not what you want!"
1,Absolute waste of money,"As others have stated this is an utter waste of money,I have owned it for a while now and it has spent most of its time collecting dust in a cupboard. It never worked as it should from the start and as soon as the warranty ran out I decided to pull it apart and discover why it wasnt up to the job it is sold for. The reason it will not build pressure is because the ""pump"" part,I use the term pump very loosely as it is merely 2 nylon gears running counter rotation in a relatively cavernous housing. The gears provide no seal against the walls of the ""pump"" housing so therefore will never be able to force water down a small bore pipe at anything like what it needs to be. I have now swapped the motor and pump for that off an automobile washer bottle to make use of the timer function. If you aren't hands on send it back stating not fit for purpose as in my mind it is a trading standards issue and is indeed not able to do the job it is advertised for."
1,worthless junk.,I got this product and all it does is leak water into the cage from the hose and the timers do not work at all it just sprays water when you unplug it and plug it back in. It is a piece of junk buy something else save you money its worthless..
1,RAIN,"this device not only irratates your animal, it also brings you humidity down with the large amount of water at the bottom. dont think about buying it it is taerrible."
5,Spriritual Warefare: Disarming the Enemy Through the Power of God (Fisherman Bible Study Guide),Just started using the book in our Sunday School Class. It looks like a great book. We were really pleased in Amazon.com and the prompt service that we received for getting us 37 copies of this out of print publication.
5,Some great metal,"I have waited forever to get this album, and it was really worth the wait. I have a huge CD collection including all the Lamb of God, korn, system of a down, disturbed, slipknot, Five Finger Death Punch, Van Halen, and Guns and Roses albums, and I have to say, this little Gem from As I lay Dying is among the best I own. Just hearing them so raw, and heavy is amazing, and I kinda wish they would have stuck to this style of writing and recording. All of there other albums are good, but this is the best in my opinion. Its put together great for a debut album, and is a little rough around the edges, which is just how I like it. This my friends is a hard hitting album, and should be in everyone's CD collection."
1,Why these christian bands try ripping off zao ?,"Can't they come out with their own vocals styles ?Well, as far as the music goes...I hate as i lay dying but i decided to give their debut a chance because i didnt enjoy their other album frail words collapse but hey it doesn't mean that their debut will suck for the fact that many debut's are better then its continues release right ? Wrong! Aild's debut still horrible and i dont even know if ""beneath the encasing ashes"" is actullie their debut but well it realy suck hard and again all the songs are mediocre..Heavy ? Please--this coulnd get heavy if it tried to be at all! Buy red chord's *fused together in revolving doors"" now thats a heavy metalcore. For good christian metalcore stick with normajean & zao foget the rest please!!"
2,Wrong filter this is not a metal one.,I bought this filter thinking it was the metal one but it is not it is the same plastic one i could have bought for $6. Disappointed in Amazon for product misinformation.I'll keep it cause I can still use it but I wont be purchasing filters from Amazon anymore :(
1,This game is terrible,"The game crashes and repeatedly reboots my computer after the very first credits screen comes up before the main menu. My system more than supports this game as I have a P4 2.8ghz processor, an ATI X800, 1gb ram etc etc. They have no support for this game either and I have had a very hard time being patient with the techs I get on the phone. All of my drivers are updated as well so I don't know what can be causing the problem. Also, every other game I have purchased in the past year has worked just fine on this PC. Anyway, unless you're prepared for long phonecalls with no results from a crappy tech support team don't buy this game."
1,most unfriendly to setup pc game I loaded this year,"I have played alot of pc games over the years. I am very familiar withthe ability to customize controls for these games to best suit personal style. This game has exactly 0 ability to use the mouse or gamepads... a very frustrating and dissapointing limitation. The mobility of the charachters is also very archaic and limited as well. I was hoping to use the advertised 2 player capability to let both my kids play at the same time - the only way this is possible is to have them both using the keyboard at the same time - and they are 4 1\2 and 6 yrs old, so guess how easy that is? Not gonna happen. In hindsight, I wish I had not bought this game. Bummer.P.S. I rated 3 for fun because to be honest my oldest son still likes to play it... but he has LOTS of requests for help, FYI."
1,Multi-player Bunk,"No Gamepads work. The instruction book says there is a controller setup under Options but it does not exist. When you look at Player 2 under Options the Gamepad appears programmed for play and appears functional , but then fails to operate when you start the game. The only multi-player action possible is with 2 people on the Keyboard. What a joke! There are no patches anywhere and apparently no fix in the works. The maker does not publicly acknowledge any problem. I have 20+ years as a computer builder, user, and gamer and this is pure bunk (spelled crap)."
2,BORING...*yawn*,"Just like every other beat-em'-up game, this one does not capture your attention. Oh my god, if you are going to waste your money on this, buy something like Half-Life or Call of Duty 2 or even World of Warcraft. God, how long can they keep this up?"
3,seller great,"I have purchased from this seller before and never had a problem before, this time the coffeepot was sightly irregular but I guess that is why it was markdown so much. I still will purchase items from seller they always ship on time and are willing to work with you when you have a problem. (which is rare)"
2,Curtains,Not being a sewer nor very good at math I found it challenging to figure out the yardage etc. Would have liked more pictures and step by step instructions. Curtains in book were very old fashioned and dated. I did manage to sew some curtains for my living room although it took longer than I would have liked it to.
2,Disappointing,"I just finished reading this book and am not sure why I didn't abandon it halfway through, perhaps due to hopes of it getting better. The heart of the plot is random and unrealistic, the characters are stereotypical and mostly underdeveloped, and the ending is disappointing and unsatisfying. I'd say the only good thing were the descriptions of the streets and working class life of India. I never quite bought into the weird depresssion Ramchand was going through based on other people's problems."
3,"Intereresting, but....","Not a bad first attempt, but there are definitely flaws. Characterization is hit or miss - some characters are much better developed than others, and even the better developed ones can be a bit hit or miss. Imagery is great. Plot is unfocused, choppy, and ends with the equivalent of ""and she died."" (Not really a spoiler.) I'll check out a second novel...this was a passable read."
2,Really depressing...,"As a fan of Indian fiction I was really excited to read this novel. I had read a glowing review on it and put my name on the local library list for it. Boy was I disappointed! The writing was overly simple and dull. Ramchand, the main character, elicited no sympathy from me. I never felt like the author adequately explained the inner turmoil that was so central to his character. Overall I found the book depressing."
5,A Beautiful Novel,"I loved this book. It was as good as Steinbeck. It was also cleanly written- unlike many of the overly pompous reviews here.I read it when it came out, and have been doing Google searches once a year or so ever since, waiting for more by this author. I just found out today that she had a new book come out in May, 'Tell Me a Story', so I came to Amazon to order it-and was so suprised by the 3 and a half star review average for 'The Sari Shop' that I had to add my two cents. This is honestly one of the most perfectly written books I've ever read- anyone complaining about the plot, characterization, ""simplicity"" or anything else is a Fool."
4,Decent . .,"Really good sound quality for the price range. Suppresses outside noise very well due to such a snug fit. Since there are six (three different sizes for each ear), most people should find a decent match. Some of my friends found it kinda' hard to get used to sticking it in their ear but I thought it was rather soft and comfortable. It also stays in the ear quite well even while shaking one's head (Yep, I tried. I like a good tight headset.) According to everyone I called, the voice quality was also pretty good. Never had anyone complain to me about not being able to hear me unless it was windy or lots of background noise. (Don't think any other phones really do well in those conditions anyway.) The one downside is that due to the cylindrical design of the wire, the wiring came apart on the inside (took it apart to figure out why) because I used to wind the cord when not in use. Lasted about six months though. All in all, a pretty good headset . . just don't wind it up or fold it too much."
1,Not So Good,"I bought 2 of these (one for me and the other for my sister); we both didn't like them. At first, it seems like the fit is perfect... then after about 15-20 min. my ear starts hurting (so much that it's impossible to wear) - I used this for about a week, thinking my ear needed to get use to it - that didn't work. Also, I found the mouth piece too far from my mouth - this isn't a problem if you talk very very loudly. I also noticed that there is a constant quiet fuzz sound in the background. My sister experienced all of the above as well. All in all, I ended up taking them both back. Still looking for a good one!"
4,Doesn't quite hit the mark but good read none the less,"Jessica Kincaid is the Mayor of Dallas. Brant Harding is a former secret service agent now living reclusively in Arkansas. When Jessica starts getting threatening emails and phone calls, her good friends Veronica and Thurmond convince Brant to return to Dallas to protect Jessica. She represents power and money. He 's macho and down to earth. They battle and sparks fly first from anger and eventually from passion. It's typical romance fare but initially I couldn't buy the attraction between these two. They both were a bit too remote and unyielding to be really likeable. The story was, however, interesting."
3,Good but could be better,"I finished the story only because I wanted to see how it finally came out. But before the end, the heavy use of backflashes started to bother me. Would have been much better if instead of the backflashes to tell us what happened we could have stayed in the action and witnessed it first hand. The hero for being an ex-secret service type seemed a bit too soft, even if he had been out of the game for awhile. There just seemed to be too many holes in his security. Even with that this would have been a 4 almost a 5 if there hadn't been so many flashbacks."
5,Good Looking and Effective,They add some good looks to my viola and are very effective. I find them to be quality fine tuners. They make tuning much easier.
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this for my 20-month old as she loves stickers and likes to manipulate things. I thought she would enjoy placing the stickers in different places on the pages and had originally tried to find Colorforms but apparently those aren't made anymore.The stickers were hard for me to pull off their original sheet, even using my long fingernails. They were impossible for my toddler to pull off. They were only slightly easier to pull off of the other pages. The price is very low on these so at least I'm not out a lot of money, but I was very disappointed."
3,Eddie Begins a Decline...,"He wasn't the same in the mid-seventies. With titles like ""Bad Luck is All I Have"", ""I Need Some Money"", ""How Can You Live Like That?"" and ""That is Why You're Overweight"", one might get the sense that he was a little bitter. After all, the electric reed trumpet never really caught on and the seventies were rather hard on varitone tenor players. There are a couple funky moments on these albums and some serious straight ahead jazz playing as well (""Ambidextrous""), but overall this is a very unfocused set and not at all easy to listen to."
4,"Entertaining, but not for purists","It's tempting to dismiss ""Bad Luck Is All I Have"" and ""How Can You Live Like That?"" as sell-outs, but there are fine musical moments on both. The vocals are amusing. It's not ""Exodus To Jazz,"" but then few records are."
1,It's amazing what gets published these days,"This book is offensive with blatant, nonsupported blanket statements about the eternal dance between men and women. It is not respectful and it degrades women. Anyone who would take it seriously would destroy any relationship worth keeping. It's no wonder there is a 50% divorce rate -- probably occurs with people who read this stuff and believe this is how relationships and families operate."
2,It could have been better...,"It made me feel as if men are supposed to do whatever it is they want to do while their female companion continually ""gifts"" them. I'm tired of ""gifting"" all the time, just to receive zilch!"
1,are you kidding me?,"Seriously. An ""OWNER'S"" manual? OWNER. Right. Here in America, men do not OWN their sex partners, wives, girlfriends, or lovers. That right there should tell you how much respect this author has for women. Seriously, do not give this guy even one of your hard-earned dimes."
3,guy thing,"This book was helpful for understanding guy logic. I learned alot and found it informative. However, the book also tends to be repetitive and could have been edited more stringently."
1,D,"This book is fairly demeaning to men - it takes stereotypical behavior and uses it to explain men. Men - like women - are people, and are far more complex than this book makes them out to be."
3,mixed bag,"I agree with previous reviewers who say this perpetuates stereotypes. The stuff about how women dress getting their male co-workers turned on was especially silly. And I am probably one of those masculine women who likes men in touch with their feminine.However, I read selected parts to my teenage son and he said ""I hate that book, it explains too much!"" And there are parts of it that make clear some male behaviors I have seen repeatedly and wondered about.So ,as with any book, just a little more so,use your judgement, make use of what makes sense, discard the garbage."
1,Setback in Relationships,"The book took old stereotypes of male-female characteristics, couched them in new age terminology, and tried to pass them off as new, original ideas. The suggestions ever perpetuate behaviors that men SAY they find irritating about women, such as being indirect. Not only are the concepts here uninspired, but often inaccurate. There is no indication of what Mr. Dieda bases his theories on. I could find no research cited, or even a mention that this is based on his exxperience after counseling X number of couples in X number of years. And if I see the word ""gift"" used as a verb one more time, I might scream!"
4,Attention Chrome Cowgirls,"This is a very personal, spiritual and inspirational book from Sasha (who also happens to be a dear friend of mine). The writing is clearly from the heart and soul of the author. Included are many other stories of women and their rides and what motorcycling has done for them and their lives. There is also a great chapter on the history of women in motorcycle. The many photographs included are an added plus. Every woman who rides or is thinking about riding should pick up this read."
4,Girl Power,"Once upon a time there were only a handdful of female singer songwriters of note. You know. Joni Mitchell, Carly Simon, Carole King, the usual suspects. These days its women who are changing the styles and moods of pop music. So, for a new act to pop up on a brand new independent record label, who is way more than yet another Jewel wannabee is welcome news indeed. I heard her at the beginning of may at a theatre date in Memphis Tennessee,and the album is a more considered , more polished version of her quite compelling live show.Vantreese is wordy, sometimes too wordy perhaps but she gets aways with it because her heart and soul are in the right place. Musically this is broad ranging, some acoustic gentility and some raunchy rock guitar at different times. If anyone out there likes Sheryl Crow and Tori Amos and Anni DiFranco they should check out Lynette Vantreese. A surprise packet and I'm glad I found it"
1,POOR POOR POOR QUALITY,"Meridian can only be found if you buy the Charles Band Collection for quite a bit. Decadent Evil can be easily found though. I was happy to get Meridian and Decadent Evil both in a single pack. However the quality of both movies is worse than VHS quality. In fact it looks more like VHS 3rd generation bootleg copies. A normal DVD is 8.5 gigs a movie. Many older film stock movies can easily fit on a 4.5 GB dvd without any really noticeable quality loss. However, the company that put this out put BOTH movies on a single 4.5 gb DVD resulting in a horrible quality product. It's so bad I kinda wish I had simply bought a used VHS version of Meridian. If anyone from Echo Bridge Entertainment sees this, then I hope in future releases you pony up the extra ten cents or less it costs to produce a quality dual layer DVD of these two releases, use two separate discs, or a double sided 4.5 GB DVD so we don;t have to suffer through horrible quality movies."
3,Comes in an Eight Movie Pack for a lot less.,"Received these movies in an eight movie pack from Walmart all for $5.00. The dvd is called, ""The Midnight Horror Collection 8 Movie Pack"". I see that Meridian is expensive by itself. Don't pay too much for it. This movie does show as a vhs tape though. It wasn't remastered at all, but it will do. I haven't seen all of the movies yet. The legend of Sorrow Creek, have some pretty good actors in it. Kind of a weird curse story though. For $5.00, I'am not complaining."
2,"Review the DVD, not the movie itself!","Poor quality transfer of a film of little interest... But, this is a film about nudity. In fact, this is the only time you get Sherilynn Fenn nude as a brunette (Boxing Helena is unacceptable, so don't go there). That's all this film is... the same as Gia or Embrace of the Vampire. Pretty actresses looking hot at their peak- that's it. Review A/V only please!"
3,nicely made but theres something funny with it,i dont know whether it was one that i got or if it happens alot with the master replicas but if you swing it around a few times it seems to flicker and start turning on and off when you swing it a certain way. trying to wait for master replicas to send me an email as to fixing this matter.
5,Lightsaber,"I liked this item a lot, and its very durable, realistic sound and actually yoda size compared to the other ones"
5,Amazing!,"Bought this for my son for last Christmas and he loves it. Very realistic. I wish they had these when I was a kid! It is very green, in a cool way."
3,Delayed Sound FX,"There was a problem with the sound effects in the lightsaber that was sent to me. The ""clash"" sound occured about a second after the lightsaber struck a surface. I returned the ""Master Replicas""-branded lightsaber and ordered the Hasbo-branded one. I just received the second lightsaber today, and it does not have the delayed sound effect. I'm not sure if I just received a faulty Master Replicas lightsaber, or if all of their Yoda lightsabers have this problem. It is not a big problem...just very annoying, and one that you don't have to put up with."
2,Very poor sound effects,Most of the time the sound effect for swinging the blade either doesn't happen at all or occurs long after the blade stops moving. The sound quality is also very tinny.
5,Great!!!,"its super bright and pretty durable, i lest it at my friends house one time and the switch wouldn't work, but after playing around with it for a little bit it went back to working every time, and its 100% fixed now. p.s. its good for raves to."
2,"Fun toy at first, now (8 months) it does not work very well.","I purchased this one about 8 months ago, and it was delivered on time and a perfect working condition. My son loved it and occasionally played with it very gently. He has other cheaper version of lightsabers for the rough play. The light part of this lightsaber is made with about 5 sections of lights from bottom to top. About a month ago, out of blue, The bottom part of the light is now inverted. So it comes on when the power is off and it goes off when the power is on. The other lights work normally. So just to keep it, we had to take the battery out. It is impossible to open to see how I can fix this either. So sadly, it is just resting on a shelf..."
4,Yoda Lightsaber,I bought this for my son and he loves it. It is smaller than the other ones and therefore easier for him to handle.
4,"Short but very consise. Gets to the point, no fillers","As I prepared for the exam, I was fearful of getting a text book as thick as a dictionary. This book is only 316 pages, including the sample tests and index. The author covered every area of the exam with precise information. He covered all the material and gives you a good picture of what to expect for the test."
5,The History of American Religion,"Coming from a background that is neither of the Restoration Movement, nor of the Holiness movements that came from the Cane Ridge American revival period, I still found this book to be objective and interesting. Conkin, as previously stated by other reviewers, does an excellent job of presenting the materials in a way that is neither flattering, nor insulting to the frontier's people. Instead, he gives rational explanation for why they behave how they do and a peek into the 17th century religious mindset that would prompt the religious exercising. This is a book worth checking out, even according to this 20-something Bible College student."
2,BAD SINGING,"I HAD TO GIVE AWAY THIS DVD. THE SIGING WAS TERRIBLE, ESPECIALLY THE TENOR.THE PRODUCTION WAS NOT GOOD EITHER. NOT NICE TO WATCH. SOUND WAS POORI WILL STAY AWAY FROM THE M22 PROJECT"
5,No better way to start your day,"John Paul was and continues to be one of the most insightful and astounding men of faith who have shared this planet with us lay folks. He begins this booklet with the ever famous statement, ""Do Not Be Afraid"". He then gives reasons why we should have ""no fear"". Begin your day having BREAKFAST WITH THE POPE! Then check yourself for attitude change after a few readings. One a day and the blahs seem to go away. Recomended for Catholics, Protestants, and all faiths."
3,Considering the range of Romanian books...,It is a good book for people like me who desperately need material; however it's not great for learning Romanian thoroughly.It's worth the money but it has a few obscure phrases and not enough that I would like to learn. It is a good book but not a 'one stop shop' for learning Romanian and other resources would be required
5,Great advice for advancing your career,"In today's policy environment, a large part of the analyst's job is selling their ideas and analysis. Too often I've seen bad ideas and analysis win over good ideas just because the bad ideas had better marketing. This book helps you learn to present yourself and your ideas in a more persuasive fashion especially to decisionmakers who don't have the time and/or attention span to really understand an issue."
5,Depileve deluxe warmer,perfect !! just what i was looking for ! ! ! ! ! ! !! ! !! ! ! ! ! !! ! ! ! !!
1,Horrible almost from the beginning,"I don't know if this was just a fluke, but mine was horrible almost from the beginning. It sounded terrible; made a lot of creaking. I took it into the bike shop and they didn't make it any better. I'm replacing it now because the cranks keep coming off."
2,not overly pleased,After 5 wears the stitching in the wast band has come out and the belt no longer works. Look and comfort were good but now they cant be worn.
2,$10 shorts with $5 shipping...,"I was very unhappy to find that the shipping for these shorts, shorts that cost under $11.00 had a SHIPPING COST of $5.00. That was OUTRAGEOUS. I didn't want to keep the shorts but since the shipping was so much (50% of the value!) I decided I'd rather give them away then return them."
5,great cap,"these caps were a lifesaver, i could not find the right size cap at home depot or lowes, then i found these. they were cheaper than the stores and they are high quality. cant beat it!!!"
2,ok to have as acollector's item but...,"Compared to the original this is a joke. It's only my opinion, but most of today's music is garbage. Kinda like the 2nd woodstock, gimme a break. On top of it, everyone got out of control; nothing at all like the original. I guess in my opinion I just like to keep it real. I gave it 2 stars for it's collectible status, but 5 stars for the disc itself being a good frisbee."
5,good cd but wasent limited edition,i bought this cd when it first came out. a few years ago i broke the cd. bought it again from amazon and was listed limited edition but wasent.
3,Slurpy Good,"This is a swirly slurpy dream of an album! Perfume Tree were far too underrated in their prime. ""Felt"" isn't quite up to the standard of ""Feeler"" (it's less cohesive), but definitely worth owning. Buy it quick, before time leaves these beautiful musicians in the dark drifts of history's dust."
5,Amazingly long lasting and beautiful,"If you like citrus, marvelous hibiscus, and lemon with a beautiful vanilla base, you will love CSPs latest creation Vanille Citrus. In my humble opinion, this is simply exquisite. This is longlasting and smells great on skin as well as on fabric. Love this!Notes: Candied Lemon Peel, Brazilian Orange, Blackcurrant Syrup, Tahitian Vanilla, Pink Hibiscus, Sweet Rose Jam, Chocolate, Vanilla Cream, Sugared Condensed Milk."
2,Absurd price,"I've read a few of the essays in this book, and found them to be very good, so I thought I'd get a copy to review, with the intention of possibly using it as a textbook.I can understand how the hard copy could get so expensive, if it had gone out of print, but why on earth is the infinitely reproduceable kindle edition $167?! If the price were reasonable (say, 1/10 of the current price) I might consider assigning it, or recommending that students purchase it. Then Blackwell would make plenty of money, making between 10-20$ for each copy of something that costs them nothing per copy, instead of failing to sell any copies at all (because, lets be real here, there are very few people out there who would pay this kind of money for a book that they can get from a library). I can't imaging what the reasoning is behind this."
4,This blanket works great when used with Kiddopotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Blanket,"My baby always got out of his swaddle blankets and I tried them all, including this one which he also can get out of. BUT I found a solution that works. If I use this blanket with the Koddpotamus & Co 100% Cotton Knit SwaddleMe Blanket he stays swaddled all night! Amazing. So for those of you who are desperate to have you babies stayed swaddled and nothing is working, try this and the other swaddle blanket I mentioned together. Put this one on first and then the other one on over top. I leave the legs out because it's the arms that cause the waking. Ths reason I give this blanket 4 stars is because it doesn't work without the other swaddle blanket on top."
3,no so sure anymore,My 4 mo old STILL will only sleep if swaddled. This is a great blanket for that. Although today I heard him squirming around and I got up to pick him up and the loose end of the blanket that he is supposed to be laying on top of (wrapped around) had made its way over his face!! Luckily we have a movement monitor that would have gone off had he stopped breathing but I have no idea how this happened. I'm glad I was awake to hear him and get up. I have loved this blanket these last 4 months. he won't sleep without it.
3,It's ok.,"I bought this swaddle blanket because I needed something bigger. However, my 23inch little man didn't fit. It caused his legs to fold up. I do really like the weight of the material if you live in a hot climate and the seperate bottom is nice for the middle of the night diaper changes. It is easier for a baby to break out of this one then the Halo Swaddle Sack with velcro if you are tired and don't get it tight enough."
3,No Go,"I was so excited about this product. Great design, instructions and texture.But after 2 days of being swaddled in the hospital my baby wanted NOTHING to do with this blanket or being swaddled. We even had the nurses try it out, just to make sure we were doing it right... and it was a 'no go'. So, I would wait and see if your child enjoys being swaddled.. then purchase this product. It think it would be very affective but because it is expensive I would hold off on the initial shopping spree until baby arrives.Side note- my baby also would not sleep on her back. She is 6 months old and has slept on her tummy/side and is perfectly healthy. But due to SIDS, please remember to try different approaches for back sleeping first before going with tummy sleeping. Wanted to mention this because swaddling requires them to sleep on their backs and this ended up not working for us.Best of Luck!"
4,Great product,"Works great for my baby who was flailing around in her crib and got out of every other swaddling blanket. The only downside is that she is now over 4 months old and is completely addicted to it. There is no way she will sleep in her crib without it. I'm not sure how hard its going to be to wean her off of it, but I wish I hadn't created a bad habit that we'll have to break"
3,its ok but not for cold places,we live in a drafty house and this just didnt cut it and they grow out of it quickly if you get it get early
3,eh.,"The only plus is he doesn't escape it like the others. It did not cause him to sleep longer (3 months old, sleeps 6 hrs) and its a pain to get on. After a few times it becomes routine but in the middle of the night.... annoying. You can slip the bottom down to change baby's diaper but it becomes loose. If your baby breaks out of the others then get this... but don't expect baby to sleep longer."
2,Beware! Text is Spanish,If you don't read Spanish then consider this book just a picture book. It would be nice if somewhere it had been mentioned that this book is NOT IN ENGLISH. The pictures are OK.
3,Beware-it is in Spanish,Nowhere in information about this book does it mention that it is in Spanish.
3,still waiting for them to flatten,"The posters are lovely and I am looking forward to putting them up. They arrived in a bundle and after three weeks of lying under heavy books they are still curling up, which makes putting them up on my classroom walls very difficult! Strongly suggests the seller uses flat shipping boxes instread of the triangular one.Also there was unnecessary propaganda included in the package."
1,Titanium PowerBook and Mac OS 10.3 ONLY!,"Be aware that this Cardbus Adapter, though sold as for the PowerBook with Mac OSX, works ONLY with the Titanium PowerBook models and with Mac OS 10.3 ONLY. If you upgrade to Tiger, your out of luck... No mention from D-Link IF or when they may upgrade the software drivers. Additionally, to use this Adaptor, one has to open the System Preferences to access a rather clumsy control panel each time. There is no quick access through the menu bar... As for range, it is actually less than the Airport Card on the Titanium PowerBooks, which is not very good. If you have an older PowerBook, I would recommend finding and buying an original 802.11b AirPort card. It will cost you more but in the long run, you will be much happier."
2,Not 802.3af PoE compliant,"It is not readily apparent when reading the product description but this product is NOT 802.3af PoE compliant. This will cause compatibility problems with some POE cameras such as the Panasonic line of products. The only thing this product is guaranteed to work with is Dlink products. For me, having separate transmit & receive modules defeats the purpose of having POE device. The DC out cable will only work with a limited number of products. Recommend you look elsewhere if you want to power a non-Dlink camera or POE device."
3,Wrong Item,This is not a POE Injector!!! If thats what you want this is not it. It power items through ethernet but not POE items
2,Misunderstood. (trying to get XBox 360 online),"First off, I'm sure that this is a great product for what it's supposed to do. But i was looking at all of the other POE adapters and wondering why this one was so much cheaper, I bought it and thought I was getting a steal. When it came in the mail I was confused this POE adapter unlike most of the others requires for a long long ethernet cable (not included) to be ran from your router to the device you want to hook it up to, it isn't one of those wall to wall ethernet adapters. So in short if you know what your doing buy this product, if not Don't. Know I have to purchase another POE adapter so that i can finally get my XBox 360 online."
3,Compatiblity Alert,"This product is not 802.3af PoE compliant. That means you must use the included terminal unit with the included base unit. If you get a PoE switch later on it will not work with the terminal unit. Why they did it that way, heaven knows. Given that, you might as well hack splitters on both ends yourself and save some money. No electronics would be involved just wiring in the AC adapter at the base end and wiring in the connector at the terminal end using the unused cat5 pair. With a long cable run the device might not work but you've got nothing to lose."
5,Great for my camera!,I used this for a d-link camera and it worked great - directions could have been a tad easier - or better labeling on the components themselves. Make sure you read the directions closely.
4,Ethernet Adapters,"Nice little gadgets..Works well, pretty neat, you wont be disappointed and for the price you just can't go wrong, so try it."
4,Works but not the way I thought it would,"DWL-P200 is really intended for use with products that dont have POE ability. It is not intended to power a POE compliant Device. Basic configuration of the DWL-P200 is straight forward and easy. It is a nice way to power a 12v or 5 volt network device in a location that doesnt have any wall outlet power (attic or basement).simply, plug the base module into the network and plug in the powersupply to the wall.run and connect a CAT5 cable between the base and terminal module ..on the terminal unit select the approprate voltage via switch (5/12 vdc)plug the dc power cable from the terminal module to your network deviceconnect a network cable from the terminal module to your network deviceBINGO! Done!"
2,No power supply,This item did not come with a power supply... how am I supposed to power my POE devices without the adapter? lame.
2,Does not do what I wanted,I purchased this thinking it would circumvent running Cat5 to a room in my home. From what I can tell that is not the case...it's only good for keeping from having to run low voltage power to a remote location such as for a surveillance camera. Well shame on me for not doing the proper research. I had never messed with PoE before so I just assumed what it was good for.
3,Works well... when working.,"Neat little device that works well for obtaining the general direction for dish pointing. Very easy to use. Of course, care in storage seems vital as mine apparently was placed next to my angle finder by someone at home, and it lost all magnetism, so has been useless since."
1,Not worth 9 cents,"Compass is not magnetized at all that I can tell. If I hold it level & turn around, the needle just turns with the unit and shows no tendancy to seek north. They could have painted a fake needle on top and it would have 'worked' ( not ) just as well. This company obviously has no quality control and workers who care zilch about the product they produce. Save your $$$"
5,A book every Christian should read!,"So powerful. I learned a lot from this book, especially about marriage, prayer, fasting, God's healing and spiritual warfare. God really spoke to me through this book and the Bible verses discussed in it. So many times when I had questions, the Holy Spirit would lead me to read a part of this book and then to the Scripture, and my questions were miraculously answered! I've started experiencing this recently ever since I got baptized by Him. It's amazing how God makes all things work for the good of those who love Him. Praise Jesus!"
3,Wasn't as good as I'd hoped,"I had a couple of songs from HM sampler disc's and really like those songs, so I tracked down a copy of the whole album.To be honest, not as good as the singles.Sound-wise, it's mid-90's alt. college rock style. There are a few decent tracks on it. It's not bad, it's just not great."
4,"Compaq WF1907 19"" LCD Monitor","I like my Compaq WF1907 19"" LCD Monitor since it doesn't take up too much space but it gives you a clear and moderately large screen. The colors are clear and vibrant. The print is easy to read. The only thing that I would look into if I was doing it over again, is that I would like a screen that is hinged that I could tilt.Compaq WF1907 19"" LCD Monitor"
3,"Looks great, but hurts my eyes","Ok, so I just bought this monitor to replace a 15"" LCD monitor.I first hooked it up through the analog input and ran the auto-calibration. First thing I noticed was 'wow, this looks great.' Second thing I noticed was that it hurt my eyes and head. I had a headache after 3 minutes of using it. Even after I stop looking at it, my eyes hurt. I tried DVI cable through the DVI input, and it was the same. No wonder there aren't many reviews on this monitor, it never got popular because it hurts peoples eyes.I think I""m going to go with my fallback, a Viewsonic."
3,Where's the volume??,"The screen is good. Everything works and was really easy to hook up. HOWEVER, the volume on the speakers was quite low on some websites, so I wound up disconnecting the monitor speakers and went back to using my old speakers."
5,CD Shows Range of Jerry's Talents,"From the opera-like drama of ""Be My Love"" to the country lilt of ""Have You Ever Been Lonely,"" this CD proves that Jerry Vale can take any song in any style and make it his own. His pure vocal talent and sensitivity to a lyric are evident throughout. ""Have You Looked Into Your Heart"" and ""All the Way"" are gems. Buy it and find out what real singing is all about."
3,Little too fat for me.,I'm a vegetarian because I try to be careful about the food I eat. While there some useful recipes in the book. I found that many were just way to high on the fat-o-meter and I will probably not use the book too much.
5,Authentic Russian singing from the prairie!,"Who would ever have guessed that such an authentic-sounding performance of this quintessentially Russian choral music would originate from Kansas City? The Kansas City Chorale, surely one of the finest groups currently singing in the US, is augmented by several extra basses (who sing those low C's with apparent ease) and by a US-based Russian orthodox priest singing the celebrant. It's no surprise that a New York Times music critic nominated this recording for record of the year."
3,Badly formatted but a good book.,"McGahan's work is clever and topical, speaking with fair directness to recent controversies over the role of inheritors in the sins of the past in Australia. His book is filled with relevant metaphors that are useful without being ponderous or distracting from the interesting and well-written central story. An old man, stained with sin, and a young boy who has to choose whether to embrace that inheritance or defy it.Unfortunately, this is one of many ebooks that appears to have just been scanned in with Optical Character Recognition, and no editor seems to have laid eyes on it since. While very readable, there are frequent errors in punctuation - in particular, the ends of dialog have their ."" changed into a :, an irritating shift.A good book, but overpriced at $10 considered the poor quality of the edition. Give it a pass."
4,Gothic cautionary tale set in Australia,"Australia is similar to America, but for every similarity, there is an almost surreal twist. This story could have been set in Kansas or Nebraska, including disregarded treaties with and atrocities performed on Indigenous Americans instead of Aborigines. There are parallels, but enough differences to lend a touch of the exotic. The only caveat I have concerns the age of William, who is at the center of this book. It seems to me that eight years old is too young to be left alone so much, woefully neglected almost to the point of abuse, and even sent on a form of walkabout. Natives send young men on such voyages of discovery when they are on the brink of manhood, not barely pubesecent. But the writing is lively, the characters three-dimensional, and the plot is a real page turner."
2,How to pay four times the price for what book is worth.,"This book on Theravada Buddhism was obviously written by remnant hippies from the 1960's. Anything stated within it can be gleaned from a hundred other sources on the subject matter which is probably what they did, and then decided to market it at the outrageous price of $37 in order to support whatever lifestyle they might have. The marketing blurb for the book is probably worth more than the book itself which should retail for around $8.Here are the names of three other texts on Theravada Buddhism which are worth every cent of their purchase price, and each of which are priced well below $25.""What the Buddha Taught"" by Walpola Rahula.""Theravada Buddhism"" by Richard Gombrich.""Love and Sympathy in Theravada Buddhism"" by Harvey B. Aronson.Incidentally, the Aronson text retails for $12."
4,Beautiful overview of images!,This is a great way to get aquainted with India's graphic history.There are many items worth using and particularly clear for many art project uses!Have fun!
4,3000 designs I might say.,"This book has a nice selection of Indian designs although some are very simple & primitive.I bought it for using in graphic designs, not all the patterns but at least 1/3 are useful.Nevertheless I'm very fond of owning it."
2,Great Designs But...,"Unfortunately the printing of the book I received was flawed. Pages are offset too high, cutting off the page numbers and top border. The bottom of the pages are stuck together and tear when I open them. I bought this book as a gift and I am very disappointed and too embarrassed to give it to the person I bought it for. If postage to/from Australia didn't take so long I would would send it back."
4,"great book, though some of the drawings are low quality","My family all love arts and design, and over the years this book has become dog eared because we have turned to it so many times for inspiration for everything from easter egg painting to cake decorating to holiday gift certificates. Some of the designs are quite low quality, it's true - they are much more useful for inspiration than for copying a design straight out of the book. I love it, and I think every household should have one - but that's just me. If you are looking for a glossy commentary and showcase of indian design, this is not the book for you."
1,gross taste,the dutch chocolate is wonderful. please taste this stuff before you sell it. it is not strawberry and it is not cream. it is chemical pink.
5,Classic sound that never ages.,"I recently rediscovered the Brandos going through my vinyl. I had 'Honor Among Thieves' and wondered why only one record from such an amazing band. So I looked online, and happily found out about all the other major releases, which I now own. 'Honor Among Thieves', 'The Light of Day', 'Pass the Hat', 'Gunfire at Midnight', 'Nowhere Zone' are all rock solid. Powerful vocals, crisp slashing guitars and solid rhythm, makes a wonderful classic rock sound that never ages. Some songs can be quite intense lyrically, as in the Solution. And there is the occasional quirky Irish folk tune ""Hard Times, Come Again No More"" on Light of Day, or rockabilly ""The Last Tambourine"" on Gunfire at Midnight, But all well done and it keeps things interesting. Any and all are must haves."
5,I learned a lot!!!!!!,"As a child, I listened to the radio all the time and of course, in the '60s, the Supremes dominated much of the airwaves. I loved their music, but really knew little about them. This book educated me, and no, I do not think it was a ""Diana Ross Bashing Book"". I believe Mary told the truth. We were just outsiders looking in; Mary was there."
3,Very Interesting,"I found this book to be very interesting. So much information on the beginning of Mowtown. The struggles of stardom and the effect it had on the friendship of three young ladies. The nitpicking Mary does on Diana went a little overboard, but otherwise very entertaining."
4,Very interesting book,I found the book to be quite interesting and nostalgic. I visited the Motown Records Museum in 1989 and would recommend the museum (Hitsville USA) to Motown fans.
3,Jealousy and Bitterness is Obvious,"Mary and Florence and some of their friends originated a girl group. When their friend, Diana Ross is brought into the group and chosen to become its lead singer, Mary and Florence feel slighted so they become jealous of Diana Ross. Who knows how long this bitterness has been harboring, but it comes to surface when Mary decides to write a tell-all book. She brings attention to herself and garners sympathy from others while tearing Diana down and painting her as the B-----(rhymes with witch) of the group. She disrespectively refers to Diana Ross as Diane when she knows full well that her name is Diana, and that's what she prefers to be called. People have a right to be called by the name that their parents gave to them.Get over it Mary. Being the lead singer of The Supremes was Diana's calling. Whatever God blesses, no man can tear down."
4,Has the Goods,"First, War of the Ancients was fun, Exspecially since im a Big time Warcraft buff, and for fans of the license, a must read.The only problem to me was the beginning was kinda confusing, many things went off at once and the conclusion suddenly became known to those who needed to know.Well This was my first Venture into the Warcraft books And I was hardly Dissapointed. I Easily understood, and enjoyed the Flow of Knaaks Style and what he added to the, though very cool, shallow surface to the characters the (warcraft) games gave to us. Cenariouse Anyone? he had nothing in Warcraft, and now we see why he was as great as he was. Good Job, Cant wait for the Second book !"
5,"Love The Lore, Love The Author","You can say that it is fairly, well, nerdy to do such a thing, buy a book based on a game you have played. But no i thought of this as an individual fiction story that could've been self based and it has represented as so. I love the authors writing capabilities, perfect mental imagery and very nice descriptions. Interesting how he transverses threw the story timelines.Very nice Lore on world of warcraftVery nice fiction novel (Half way threw the first book)I would recommend this.--------------------------------------------This brings back memories from when i first playedthe game =D (aka first few months it came out)i can't just imagine scenery better with the fact thatI've played"
4,erm? title?,"This book is really good if your interested in the warcraft lore. It describes what happens very well. I've always wanted somthing more then a summary of the story in a warcraft manual book. Its a must read for big warcraft fans. I thought it interesting all the way through, I couldnt seem to put the book down, and look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy."
4,Fun for Fans,"Just finished reading this book and had a great time doing so. The author of the book is a terrific writer of fantasy and does an excellent job of developing the scenes and characters for the readers mind. For myself, the story was a bit difficult to follow for the first two or three chapters because there were many different stories and backgrounds that had to be developed in various locations of Azeroth. After that though, the characters really begin to come into focus and the story line is easily drawn into play.The Good:1 - Follows closly the relation to Warcraft and Lore2 - Easy to understand and read (after the first 2 or 3 chapters)3 - Multiple stories that build into a pinnacle for the reader4 - Thrills that keeps a reader eager to continue onThe Bad:1. None to speak of, wish I could write as well as Knaak."
4,Good Beginning to a Great Series,"This is a good first book to a great series as i said above. I say this because, when I read this I was grounded from playing world of warcraft at the time. SO in a way this helped me ""feed the need for WoW"". I would recommend this to any warcraft fans, the next ones in the series get better!"
4,Warcraft The Well of Eternity,"In the fantasy genre this is an outstanding read. Easy to stay with,hard to put down.If you play World of Warcraft it is a must to give you the background for the game."
4,4 stars but could have been 5,4 stars instead of 5 because Knaak can be a little overly descriptive at times. Overall it was a very well written work.
4,Nice account of the first war against the burning legion and the Night elves past,I enjoyed this book as I had not previously known enough about how arrogant the Night elves used to be.I also like the development of the character known as Brox and also getting to know the character of Whisperwind
4,Semi-Lyrical Novella,"Though the supposedly YA orientation of this novella doesn't precisely play to Hand's hallucinogenic style, there's enough mystery, romance, and glamour on hand to make this a fun read. Though length and structure-wise it feels more like a novella than a short novel, the length is well-suited to the parlor romance feel of the material.And though this is pitched as YA, and Hand crops her style accordingly, in the end the overall vibe is more a middle-aged memory piece than YA romancer. That's not a criticism, just an observation."
4,"Fantastic portraits of DiMaggio, Sinatra, etc.",I say 4 stars only because of the datedness of some of the material. But the pieces on Frank Sinatra and Joe DiMaggio in this book (both written in 1966) are brilliant and incisive portrayals of a time and states of mind (and of icons in an age when celebrity was in some ways larger than life than it is today and in some ways refreshingly not) that are both long gone.
3,Shiver me timbers!!,"This book brought home, in a very real sense my experiences growing up in a sea-going family. Oh, how I longed for the days of swashbuckling and hotbunking. A bit too graphic, perhaps, for the faint of heart. Overall, a good effort."
1,Deconstructionist Rubbish,"Some people may enjoy rewriting history to suit modern prejudices; I find it revolting, and this book is a perfect example of the phenomenon. It is at best a poorly organized and incomplete review of the era of piracy; at worst, it is a pathetic attempt to impose the author's misconceived ideas on reality. Avoid it at all costs, for it is garbage."
4,The Littles,The Littles was one of my children's favorite shows when they were little. This movie will allow them to share it with their childrenThank you
1,a waste of money,"the wide angle mount is a total waste of money. the ""adaptor"" is a simple sticker magnet that attaches to the lens of the camcorder. Once it's attached, you can't even use the camera feature of the camcorder because it's crops out some of the picture (on the corners of the shot). Additionally, once you hook up the wide angle, the lens causes the shot to be continuously blury.Don't waste your money on this at all!!! F for quality and functionality"
3,Good but not great,"I purchased this lens for my Kodak Zi6 Camera.[...]There is NO question that this wide angle helps you capture a much larger field of vision. The only major downside is that the edges of the field of vision become blurry, which greatly reduces the value.But for ~$30, it's not a bad buy."
3,"Nice Try: Good Construction, Bad Photo Quality","Good construction - the magnetic ring attachment system works well. The lense feels secure when it's attached to the camera. I use the lense on the Canon Powershot S110 and SD100. *** Sadly the photo quality is lacking. *** Photos come out very blurry on the edges. It's a nice toy, but it's just a toy..."
3,The industry would collapse if all men read this book,"Hey fellas, how would you feel if you knew that hot phone-sex operator you wasted $40 on last night was really a GUY? This memoir of life in the highly profitable adult entertainment industry can be funny, but overall it is very disturbing to read about all the horrible things callers make the ""girls"" say and do. Lots of mysogyny, horrible cursing, sadistic and pedophilic fantasies...but I guess it's better these losers pay some girl (or guy) to take their abuse over the phone than inflict it upon their loved ones or strangers. A very surreal read, not for the faint of heart."
3,Prudes Beware,"Wow, does this book have a lot of language and stories. Not for the shy or easily offended. An entertaining read if you can get past the sometimes vulgar visual images that are created with the dialogue."
3,The Apology,"Just what the books states, ""A time of healing"". To know we can heal and move on with our lives is so important in our survival. This poem in itself was very real for a lot of women. To have two very important words spoken to our soul and our spirit has been not only refreshing to us but also very healing. Yes, it is very important for us to hear the words ""I'm sorry"" for what has happened to you in your life, in your relationship, it is reassuring to know there someone out there does care how we as ""Mothers, Wives, Sisters, Friends"" feel not only outward but also inward.Thank you again my friend,Beverly"
5,A must have for the historical or casual basketball fan,"This book moves to the top of the list of basketball reference books. It is an excellent resourse for basketball researchers young and old. Every professional basketball league, men or women, every coach, every player, every season and its results, every award winner, most every transaction of personnel or ownership, all of the current teams or the defunct ones and many more items are all in here. This is the Leonard Maltin of basketball reference books. I do not know Robert Bradley, but I can thank him. I guess you can say I liked the book. It brought back memories of the old basketball info books that always left you craving more info, except this has plenty of info to keep you busy."
5,THE MOST COMPLETE BOOK ON PRO BASKETBALL PUBLISHED YET,"This is the most complete book on professional basketball written yet. More stats and catagories than an almanac, with insightful commentary on the origins of professional basketball. The pre-NBA professional leagues as well as the beginings of the Players Union. This is a complete history of profesional basketball in America."
2,Not the place to start with Mr. Rhythm,"Andre Williams is a legendary figure in the world of greasy, sleazy Rn'B. Andre's recordings for Fortune Records in the 50's and his soul/funk sides in the 60's are too good to be believed. In the 90's Andre came back in a huge way with two mind-blowing albums of psycho-garage-soul on In The Red Records - in between these albums he recorded this one. ""Red Dirt"" is Andre doing his country and western thing - obviously this type of music is one of his passions. Unfortunately, Andre simply isn't a country artist and this recording never reaches the heights (or depths) of his other records. His voice is still great and his lyrics are still funny, but the musical background just doesn't suit him. For Andre Williams completists this is an OK record, but this is definitely NOT the one to start with if you have never experienced his genius."
2,Great artist; incredibly bad mix/production,"No question that Andre Williams is one of a kind, legendary, and so on ... but the production of this CD is atrocious. Williams is credited first (of three producers). If he really had control over the sound, you have to wonder if he acquired hearing damage over the years. Massive amounts of repeat-echo and reverb, the voice mixed down to the point where you can hardly hear the words of some songs, and heavy-handed guitar that makes you feel you're sitting in front of the wrong speakers at a cheesy night club. The material is great--if you can stand to listen to it."
3,Read tool manual before you buy,"Unsure if this is a quality product or not. However, when I received the oil, the label states that the 50P oil is used on 3/4 inch impact wrenches or larger. I bought a IR 2130 impact wrench and Amazon recomends getting the 50P oil. This is wrong. You need to buy the 10P oil for 1/2 inch and smaller impact wrenches. The 50P is too viscous."
4,Hope for the future and understanding sibling relationships better.,"This book is mostly intended for older siblings, but as a 30 year old eldest child of 4, I find it especially helpful as I reexamine my relationship with my three younger brothers more closely. I am fortunate enough to have all four grandparents still living, and so when the book begins to talk about how the dynamics of sibling relationships change over the years and into older adulthood, I can't help but notice this is true! This book can offer younger siblings the hope for closeness with our siblings in our futures even though right now at this stage of the game we practice separateness to the highest degree. It's an easily digestible quick read!"
4,good cd,"I bought this for my boyfriend and he was very pleased he said a ""this is a Must for Jessee Collin young fan"""
2,Not the Best Of,"This 2 disc set is like many compilations; one decent CD and one that is just material that never went anywhere. Disc 2 is all over the map,jumping from one tempo to another, then changing rhythmically and thematically into a jumbled up mix. Speaking of mix, the sound on disc 2 is horrible. JCY's voice is drowned out in horns, blaring guitars, piano's and backup singers. It doesn't flow together in any coherent way. I say this is not the best of JCY by a long shot."
1,Feeling ripped off for the first time.,"This is the most disappointing cd of Jesse Colin Young. I love his music and his voice but this cd sounded like it was very cheaply made and some of the songs which I thought I was getting were not studio recordings but poor recordings of live performances. I ended up buying 2 of his studio cds to get the songs which I thought I was going to get on this cd. After buying at least a couple hundred cds over the last year, this is the first time I have felt ripped off. Still a huge fan."
5,Must own this one!,"Awesome and educational dvd, a favorite! Much better than many BE dvd's. Another good one that I rented from the library is A to Z symphony muisc appreciation 101 for toddlers."
4,Carved In Bone,Very well written book that is as intriguing as it is informative. Dr. Bass and Jon Jefferson do a great job of telling an interesting murder mystery with enough details as to give you a real feel for how forensic science works. It's a great read that keeps you wondering exactly where it's going.
4,great read,Really nicely written mystery with a lot of forensic detail from a man who literally wrote the book on forensic detail. The treat is in meeting the Tennessee mountain people and the author's wonderful ear for dialect. Recommended.
4,A Winning Combo,"I enjoyed the scientific aspect of the forensic details, and the way some humor was mixed in with the gruesome details of a murder investigation. The characters had some good southern flavor and distinctive personalities. It's nice to be entertained by a novel and also learn something new. If you've heard about the real 'body farm' in Tennessee and are even a little bit curious about what goes on there and how it helps to solve murder cases, you'll enjoy reading this book."
5,Best Book I have read,Because I am retired I read a lot of books. This is one of the best that i have read. I hope the authors write more with Dr. Bill Brockton in. The plot is excellent as are the characters. You learn a lot about the firld of forensic science. William Barnhardt Ret.
2,Surprised by all the Good Reviews of this Book,"I'm apparently in the minority here, but I really thought CARVED IN BONE was a pretty poor effort. This is a forensic anthropolgy mystery, in the style of Kathy Reichs, but it's far inferior to her work.The flaws with CARVED IN BONE are many. The characterization in this book is paper-thin, and the main character Dr. Bill Brockton is about as bland a hero as you can imagine. The romantic subplots involving Brockton are almost embarrsingly bad and sophomoric. The mystery plot just plods along, and the novel is filled with page after page of numbing exposition. Overall, this book just has a flat, uninspired quality that makes it a subpar read.There's some interesting information about forensics in CARVED IN BONE, but nothing you couldn't find in a far superior book by Kathy Reichs or Patricia Cornwell. Unless you're a hardcore forensics junkie, my advice is to stick with those authors and to skip this misfire."
2,Realistic portrayal of forensic science,"Technically vivd, but a generally unexciting mystery as it meanders through the storyline. Much more exciting are the scenes of the scientist performing his craft and his interactions with his students and assistants. In other words, the side stories overwhelm the main one."
3,Not the best out there.,"While I liked the story quite a bit, the lead in the book, Dr. Brockton, had the emotional maturity of a teenage boy. And, his getting sick twice, once in particular when he put his life and anothers in danger and resulted in the death of a dog, I found pretty unbelievable. And, he passed out twice.I wouldn't like this at all in the leading character of a woman, and I certainly don't like it in a man. Some of his choices in his work had me wondering why he made such a stupid remark, or such a poor choice in the things he did. All in all, these authors are not for me."
4,"Good read, interesting characters, good details","For the first novel from the collective minds of Dr. Bass and his writer/friend Jon Jefferson (or Jefferson Bass), it's a winner. Unlike many novels that are written by a team, there are no obvious 'breaks' in this book. In some other team-written books I have read, it is obvious that writer A wrote chapters 1, 2, and 5, while the other author wrote chapters 3, 4, 6, and 7. It seems that they worked together much better than most other collaborators.The story moves along at a nice pace, has interesting characters, some plot twists, and is just a fun read. IN addition, you know that the technical details are real, the result of having one of the world's foremost forensic anthropologists on the team.I am looking forward to reading more from Jefferson Bass."
4,Decent entry into the thriller/mystery genre,"The Body Farm is a research facility located in Tennessee and popularized by Patricia Cornwell's novel of the same name, as well as nonfiction books such as ""Death's Acre."" Now, a scientist (Dr. Bass) and a novelist combine to write a story set in and around the Body Farm. The protagonist, Dr. Bill Brockton, is a professor at UT. The case he's handed involves a somewhat preserved corpse found in a cavern and the local yokels (I can't describe them any other way) who'd rather her killer not be found.The fact that this is a 'first novel' is evident in the thinly drawn characters. There's a bit of a plot twist at the end, but anyone who's read Patricia Cornwell before could probably figure it out. References are made to real-life Body Farm cases in the narrative (such as an explosion in a fireworks factory). It's good...not great, but not bad either."
3,Good Read But......,"A good forensic tome but those awful jokes and a lack of character development need improvement. Middle-aged men in action adventures is better left to other writers. Bass' skill is in the field of forensics and he should stay there.Better than Cornwell who has become bizarre, not as good as Kathy Reichs who has a much better literary style.Cut the action, ramp up character development and add a little depth to style and story developments. Leave the forensics alone....they are fine."
2,Carved in Bone,"High expectation, low satisfaction. I didn't like this book and can't understand the 4,5 stars in customers review rating. I gave it 2 stars and tried my best not to stop reading it to the end. I didn't recommend it."
3,TOLERABLE FIRST EFFORT!,"If you enjoy details of forensics, as I do, then you will enjoy that aspect of this book. The storyline is in keeping with an interesting mystery but falls a little short. Keep in mind that it is mostly forensics with a detailed picture grouping at the end of skeletal bones then you will enjoy the bonus of the mystery. An enjoyable first effort and I would read another of his books."
3,Gaye fades brightly,"This has the audio mastering of a distinguished amateur bootleg, making it something of an ""extreme fans only"" release because of many other live releases. The late-career performance is commanding enough, hardly touching on the studio brilliance Gaye cultivated but rather underscoring how an elaborate and well-honed backing band allowed him to flourish on stage."
1,Beware possible fire hazard!,"This bulb was in use for only 3 weeks when one day we heard a loud popping noise - like a light bulb bursting. We looked over at our iguana enclosure and saw this bulb engulfed in flames! Thank goodness we were home or this could have been much worse. Now I can't say for sure if the bulb or the fixture was at fault, however, we had been using the same fixture with other bulbs for approx. a year and never had a problem. Beware of the bulbs you buy for your reptile, lower prices do not always equate safety. We now exclusively use Mega Ray bulbs with our iguana and never leave these lights on when nobody is home. Hope this helps some.Zoo Med Halogen Heat Lamp For Reptiles 50 wt"
5,Wow!!,"I was a little hesitant at first because when I opened the jar, it looked like this purple paste-goop. I was so used to using whatever shave gel I found at the grocery store. However, I decided to take the foray into shaving with some real shaving cream and a badger hair brush and will never look back.I was skeptical at other users who said to only use a dab, but I didn't use much on the shave brush and WOW it lathered my entire face!! I used this shave gel, the gillette warming face scrubGillette Fusion Proseries Thermal Face Scrub, 100-ml (Pack of 2), and a colonel conk badger hair shaving brushColonel Conk Progress Model 1001 Standard Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Black Handlealso bought on amazon, and received the closest shave I've ever given myself without shaving against the grain.This stuff is awesome"
3,Same as Proraso Shaving Cream But Triple the Price,"Same quality that Proraso Shaving Cream, I will recommend the Proraso, of course. This Geo F. Trumper Shaving Cream is well expensive, three times more than the Proraso. This violet color leave stain on the brush too."
2,Works well but,Really works well but is greasy and stains. I have gotten some great shaves and it lathers better than other products but leaves a stain on the jar itself. I am going back to Bond cream.
4,nice,"Didn't get 5 stars b/c of how expensive it is. Not sure that it's worth the price for the functionality. I'm a newbie on using a straight razor, so maybe I am missing something, but functionality is all I was searching for. I find that the WAY less expensive items I can buy at the local grocery work just as well, or maybe even better for me.DEFINITELY smells GREAT. One would think that a great smelling, purple cream one puts on their face would be less than manly, but IT'S NOT!I'm going to use the sturdy canister to hold loose screws and nails in my shop. I bet it would work as a good ash tray as well."
4,Review of Kasco De-Icer,"I have been quite impressed with the kasco de-icer 3/4 horsepower model so far. I placed it off the end of the dock and it has kept the entire area free of ice. It may have worked too well. In fact, not only is the area around my dock is ice free so is a 100 feet on either side of my dock. Some of the ice fisherman are complaining. The only thing keeping my score from a 5 star rating is the electrical draw. After the first month of usage my electrical bill jumped up quite a bit. Since then I have realized that I can run it half days and still keep the water open even in near zero temperatures. Some have bought the optional thermostat and that seems to help keep the utility bills down. Overall this thing does what it promises and will keep water open in even the coldest of temperatures."
5,Such a great idea!,"So you loan a book to a friend. A trusted friend. A kind friend. A friend you know will return the book in due time. A couple years go by ... and you forget all about that $30 hardover book you loaned to your good friend. Meanwhile, she's forgotten all about it too. She sees it on her shelf and thinks, ""Who did I borrow that from?""Well, worry no more! Don't let overdue books ruin friendships! With the Personal Library Kit you can keep track of who has what book and for how long! It's such a cute idea.Not only can you keep track of your books better, but you can also see how many people have borrowed a particular book (you could even add a rating-system to know who liked/disliked the book).I am so thankful my friend got this kit for me. I just started using it and it's a hoot. It would make a great gift for any booklover who likes to spread love through books."
3,Great but...,"I love this kit, it comes with everything you need. The only problem is that you can't buy those same pockets and cards anywhere else. I have so many books, I've already run out of pockets! So I either have to buy a whole kit again, or get some cheap pockets and cards instead. I wish they sold them seperatly too."
3,historic interest,"very good book about the creation of the israeli army .Wingate was to the jews what Laurence of Arabia was to the arabs.Easy reading!!Wingate did not participate in antisemitism,rampant in England,so he found death in an""accident""just like Patton."
4,read it!,"I am not a very big reader. I read this book and fell in love with it. It has a lot of everthing:romance, comedy,and pure poetry. After reading the story, my class and I put on a play of this book, everyone enjoyed it of all ages. So if you are not a big reader like me read this book you will change your mind."
2,Bride of the Castle is a dissapointment.,"The earlier Castle Perilous novels have had their ups and downs, but have always satisfied on the whole. Bride of the Castle, on the other hand, isn't worth picking up. DeChancie's humor, action, and witty dialogue are still there, but he tries to make the plot too big. There's the main plot of the wedding day of our hero, Gene. and our heroine, Linda, and Gene's doubts about whether and he can be a husband, and the temptation of infidelity before the wedding, which dissapointed me somewhat. Then there's a whole subplot about some guy we've never heard of before, and his struggle to return from an alternate universe to his own home. Confused? So am I, and I read the book. The latest Castle perilous novel take on a plot beyond it's needs, and then ends very abruptly, making it seem like the author didn't have time to come up with a more satisfying ending. New readers or fans(I know there are a few) of Castle Perilous, this book isn't worth your five bucks"
2,Lifeless,"This Castle Perilous book was a huge disappointment. This book was missing the wit, charm, and pace of the other books in the series. To be blunt, it was dull, lifeless and unimaginative."
3,Saving The Best For...Next To Last.,Easily the weakest link in the otherwise solid Castle series. That being said it is enjoyable for a true fan of the Castle novels but not on the same level as Castle Spellbound or the original.
1,not helpful,"the dvd only covers less than 7 minutes of instruction on extremely basic stuff. you already know it. couldn't get the cd to work.the book is now obsolete because the software, simply mepis 3.3 has already changed/improved. try a copy from the library, but save your money. not worth it."
2,"An introduction to desktop computing, not to Linux","This book will help people who never used a computer before. It can help you getting started with computers via the Linux way, but it will be almost useless if you are experienced with Windows or Mac OS."
2,oh please,"You can figure out most of what this book talks about by doing simple trial and error. The version the book contains is old...not the books fault....but let me tell you something about Linux.WIFI SUCKS with linux. Its more secure and its a new thing to mess around with and explore and all that, but there is a huge reason why microsoft is bitchslapping every other company around. Its easy to use and it works ... most of the time.I gave up on linux solely because no wifi manufacturer makes drives for linux.....i mean some do..but not the ones most people have. Anywho...SimplyMepis is one of the more user friendly distros...others include PCLINUXos which i liked..(but again no wifi) and knoppix 5.0 dvd is pretty cool.I dont know what the craze is about ubuntu/kubuntu...?? not as user friendly nor works as often as sm and pclinux. but im a linux newb."
2,No Annie Lennox,"FYI: The version of ""Ev'rytime We Say Goodbye"" on this soundtrack CD is NOT the version sung by Annie Lennox in the film."
4,Enticing,"Sewing fleece doesn't really fit into my plans, but after checking this book out from the library, I almost wish it did. LOTS of suggestions for embellishing basic fleece garments that are much more refined than I expected when I first picked up the book.I don't own any of her books, but should my life take me to a climate where fleece-wear was needed outside of December and January, I just might have to get them."
5,Presents several questions particularly designed and ideally place to assist the reader in their own personal decision for love,"Ably written by Robert Wolley for older readers who find themselves without the companionship by a ""significant other"", Seniors In Love: A Second Chance For Single, Divorced, And Widowed Seniors takes as its particular focus seniors entering back into the '""Love Game"" and helping them to realize that there is nothing wrong with falling back into love, or falling in love for the first time, as an elder citizen. With an outline containing several main issues, Seniors in Love presents to the readers several questions particularly designed and ideally place to assist the reader in their own personal decision for love."
1,Not the right size,"This stylus is not the correct size for my T-Mobile MDA(US) as noted by other reviewers earlier. The slot on my MDA has become loose, which is why I needed them. Nevertheless, these are too short in length to slide all the way in.I'd say choose another item."
3,Item not expected that way it is delivered.,Service is prompt. But....I bought 3 Stylus pack for my TMobile MDA. It is showed as a pack in description. But are delivered as 3 cheap quality separate styluses with no packing. They dont fit tight in my MDA and I already lost one because it didn't fit. Cheap quality stuff. Wouldn't buy again.
1,Not the right size.,They fall right out of the phone. Cheap material used. Not as shown in the picture.
2,Replacement,"These exactly replace the original stylii on the MDA. Unfortunately, the original was poorly designed and uncomfortable to begin with."
5,delightful...,Well worth more than the asking price for the core audience. I wish they would make the entire series available.
1,An amateur effort,"Having seen a fair bit of Mummy type cartoons, I have to say this is the worst one I have seen. Came across as though made by amateur cartoonists, so bad I did not finish the disc. The Mummy Scrolls were much better than this weak effort. A waste of time commenting further on this one.!!"
1,Great music but shamful production,"The idea to reproduce all 22 operas on dvd is very exiting for all opera lovers, but unfortunately this is a dissapointing and shameful production of Ascanio in Alba. This is VANDALISM.... which would kill Mozart."
1,Terrible,"The only saving grace of this production is the quality of the singers. The rest was Horrible with a capital H. The blocking, scenery, costumes, and just overall concept were just so utterly horrific it was almost laughable. Especially the chorus in fencing attire twitching and thrashing around like there was something wrong with them.The singers themselves, especially Ascanio and Venus are flawless in their technique and tone, but the director did something unforgivable by making them look bad. Not enough can be said about how awful this production is. The only reason I had the misfortune of suffering through this is because it was the only DVD of Ascanio in Alba at the time. If only someone had warned me..."
3,Boring...,"I love Celine, specially in French, and try to get everything about him... but this book is really boring! Hard to read (lost in translation ?) and not very interesting anyhow!"
3,"Worth it for the ""From Jewish Folk Poetry"" portion","For those who are excited by the spectral inventiveness of Dmitri Shostakovich in his symphonies and quartets and operas then you may want to pass on this homogenized version of the Synmphony #15. How a work of such irony, wit, and ultimate fatalism can sound so bland in at the hands of Haitink and the London Philharmonic must be tied to the studio monitoring of the work once recorded. This recording has no crackle or fire or even pathos.The same conductor at the helm of the Concertgebouw Orchestra performing 'From Jewish Folk Poetry' benefits enormously from the vocals by Ryszard Karczykowski (tenor) and Elisabeth Soderstrom (soprano) and Ortrun Wenkel (contralto). The diction is crisp and pungent, the rhythms dance, and the overall recorded sound is splendid. This piece is worth finding a disc to add to your Shostokovich file! Just skip the first 4 tracks of the #15...."
4,"Here Kitty, Kitty!!","I bought this kitty for my daughter for Christmas because she loves kitties. I was looking for something that she could cuddle because I knew she would want to sleep with it. I took a chance on this one. It turns out that this is the perfect stuffed kitty for cuddling. It is extremely soft, cuddly and floppy and she sleeps with it every night. It is far cuter than any of the stuffed cats I came across in the stores, so I am glad I ended up with this one. It seems to be durable - no problems with it yet."
5,Heavenly harp music,"Just heard opus 17 on the radio. It is extremely soothing and yet primitively wild at the same time. It comes from the same serenity Harpo would lapse into while playing, yet you knew what turbulence was just underneath the calm surface.Can't write more now, have to go ahead and order this CD. You should know I'm not much into classical music or any other kind for that matter, just what gets to me. This gets to me like 'Coat of Many Colors' by Dolly Parton, Led Zeppelin played loud,'Watching the Detectives' by Elvis Costello, the original 'Switched-On Bach', the soundtrack from 'Repo Man'..."
4,Undersea Adventure,"Brad Matsen is an excellent historian. Not only is Matsen' book a first rate adventure story about Beebe and Barton's explorations in the Bathysphere but he gives historical prospective on the times they lived in, including the influence of the media and the politics of science and exploration in the 1930s. If you ever wondered what it would be like to sit in a four foot metal sphere a half mile under water, read this book."
4,Good book!,I am a reader of historical novels but this non-fiction book is as easy to read as a novel!
5,Is it worth it??,"In my case yes.On a regular basis I have to install telescopes that require a high degree of accuracy in regard to the elevation. Where the more accurate the better. Now setting the elevation (equal to the Earth's latitude) is as simple as it gets! This saves me a lot of time where time is money. Mounting the unit to a flat plane I simply adjust the telescope until the elevation is equal to my locations latitude. Very accurate, lasts forever on a battery, nice plastic case, easy to use. What else can I say?It is pricey but you get what you pay for. I am completely satisfied with the product, and highly recommend it."
1,Ruined my whites!,"I used this on a white cotton t-shirt. It looks great in the shade, but in the sun it has big yellow blotches where I used the pen! It ruined my shirt and I threw it away!"
4,Works,It's pretty neat to watch the moldy lines of grout in my shower magically turn white over night. Worked exactly as I wanted it to.
2,Does not clean grout,Does not clean grout as I expected I had to redo th grout. It's ok for clothes bu not grout
3,Disappointed Mom...Happy toddler.,"I ordered this item for my son because his cousin had received one last Christmas when he was about my son's age now, and he absolutely loved it. I got it because of the cause/effect of pushing the buttons on the truck that toddlers seem to love at this age. I thought I was ordering the item in the picture and described, so imagine my surprise when I received a ""similar"" item and was told that the item pictured was no longer available. I have been an extremely happy Amamzon shopper for some time now, but am very disappointed with the false advertisement. My son is still enjoying the item received because it still provides what I bought it for. Even though he is happy, mom is still a bit disappointed."
2,Book of References,"This book was not what I expected. Every chapter was full of references to other books, in particular his 1st book."
3,Great Colour but Handles Can't Stand Heat,I bought this strictly for the color as I am going all turquoise in the kitchen. My main issue is with the small pot- I've only used it for boiling water yet the plastic part of the handle burned the second time of use and keeps burning anytime I boil something over one or two minutes. The plastic part of the handle became badly damaged quickly.I have not experienced this as big of an issue with the skillet. I've barely used the larger pot so not sure how that holds up. I will say the set is very easy to clean. I would recommend for other lovers of aqua coloring.I might also mention the set is available at Century 21 Dept Store in NYC for $24.95.
5,Perfect fit,"perfect fit, jsut needed to use my old screws the supplied screws didn't fit. Bright light and matches well the Spyder tail lights."
4,I couldn't decide on the rating.,"On one hand, I wasn't to crazy about the writing style, somewhat repetitive. But...the book does have many very beautiful incantations, blessings and prayers! I will certainly use them as a base and only do moderate personalization. The chapters are also nicely laid out with information about the appropriate forms of the Goddess for that topic."
3,Goddess Bless,"This brought me some interesting information, some fine Goddess Prayers. Would make a great gift for that Pagan Lady or friend in your life."
2,Pass on this one,"This marker is characterized by a couple things:Lackluster rate of fireAn exceptionally weak closed bolt systemPerfect Scenario FrameIt's appearance isn't any excuse for it's poor design. Pass this one up in favor of a M 98 if you want a beginner's gun, or even something to upgrade to a scenario marker."
4,93 Accord SE: Good fit,"Installed in 93 Accord SE 4 door sedan. It's not quite as strong as the original motor, but it fit perfectly, and works well."
4,Good kids airsoft vest,This is a good vest for a pre-teen. My eleven year old received this for his birthday. He and his friends have pretty powerful air soft rifles (340 fps); the vest worked well to protect him. He likes the look of it (very similar to police vests). This vest IS on the small side. It would not fit my three older sons or husband.
2,Don't buy unless you are very small,"I'm about 5' 6"" and this vest doesn't protect much. It's very small and doesn't fit well on me. There are two velcro straps on the sides to make it bigger but you can't make it cover more."
2,Only if you're under 5.6 and 170 lb,"I'm 6.2, 205lb and in a decent shape. This looks like I stole my little nephew shirt. One size fits all.. yeah right.. :)"
5,TOP CARPENTER SCORE,"This new release features some new tracks, previously unreleased on CD with additional dialogue samples from the film, great collection! RECOMMENDED FOR OWNERS OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION!The tracks sound different to the original release and I wouldn't trade them against each other, but own both of them!This release is dedicated to the memory of Lee Van Cleef."
4,Correction of error in review,"Darryl Stevens states this is a double CD-set - it ain't, it is two albums on ONE CD! Did he/she actually listen to it? This is from the Cadence catalogue and is, by far and away, far superior to the dross he recorded for CBS!!!!"
5,Don't Expect Anything,"I have been a Thile/Watkins/Nickel Creek Fan in all the multiple iterations. Every time something new comes out, I never expect it to be as it is. With Deceiver, I am not at all disappointed. This albulm is a glimpse into Thile's musical brain, not just a pleasant hour worshipping his virtuosity. It's an indulgent album. Chris plays every instrument! Go figure if he isn't amazing at all of them.My review may sound like some kind of critisism. It ain't me place to criticise. Let me tell you that I enjoy this record up one side and down the other. I enjoy the fun he has making the music, the quirkiness of it, and the juxtoposition of amazing skill and awkward newness.There are only a handful of artists that can write, play, arrange, and produce their own music. When one does, check it out. You get to see them undiluted, unleashed, and unencumbered. When (not if) you listen to this disc, know that Chris made it for himself, not for you silly"
5,Experimenting.,"It seems many people missed the point of this CD. I don't think Chris was trying to write a CD that would be full of radio hits.Many people wanted another Nickel Creek CD. That's not what he was trying to do here either.It seems he was trying to write a very personal album, something that was totally different from anything done before. We can see this in his strong structures-- not your normal verse/chorus/verse/bridge/chorusx2 deal. The strong structure remind me more of works like Queen's ""Bohemian Rhapsody"". Sometimes no real chorus and verse parts, that repeat, just a linear musical work.I think Chris accomplished what he was shooting for. Some may not like it--but that wasn't his goal here.Personally I love it. And I have to disagree with the reviewer that said he lacked at the other instruments. I think they sound great, especially the guitar and drum parts."
3,Good ... but not Nickel Creek Good,"I sure miss the sound of Nickel Creek - this is close - but the harmonys are lacking. One of those CDs you play a couple of times, then it disappears into the glovebox and you don't really miss it. You find it a year later and say ""Oh Yeah - I forgot about that one"" - but don't really bother to play it again."
3,Not what I expected...,"I am a huge Nickel Creek fan, as well as a huge Chris Thile fan. I listen to Not All Who Wander Are Lost almost every day, and I've had it for months now. When I realized that Chris had a new cd, I immediately bought. I received the cd two weeks ago, and I have to admit I wasn't so thrilled. It's not horrible, it's just not at all what I expected from him. I have to respect him for trying out new things, but if you're looking for something like Nickel Creek or his other solo albums, this probably isn't the one for you."
1,Come On,"So apparently the last time I reviewed this it was so scathing that it got removed after 2 weeks. I'll shorten it up this time: This album is wonderful for those who think it's wonderful. I respect that; I'm a pro mandolinist and an art lover. However, Chris has a special gift to create instrumental newgrass music for the next millenium. He has NO special gifts with his voice or his emotions; his are just like everyone else's. He made this album, that's fine. It's a symbol of the state of the music industry right now. Get on with your career and use your gift as a newgrass instrumentalist! Oh and p.s. Every time I see you play live, your sound guys do a terrible job; the mandolin should be much louder. Love U. Dave."
3,Keep Paddling the Old Canoe...,"Oh. My. Goodness. I wouldn't have put it quite so colorfully, but I have to agree 100% with the review by ""luva/hata 'ragout77'"". Spot on.Technically, Thile is a wunderkind, but honestly--maybe he should not be writing his own songs right now. If the songs on this album are a sampling, he'll benefit from a A LOT more life experience, a few lessons in melody and some meaning to back it all up.I can't say this album didn't evoke emotion in me, because it did make me feel very annoyed. And disappointed. Was that what he was shooting for?Keep trying Chris--I'm a fan so I can't wait for it to be good."
5,Not a bluegrass album.,I love seeing people complain about Thile's album's as if they're all supposed to be bluegrass. This is one of the top 5 albums I own of any genre. You can easily see where Nickel Creek's newer material comes from through this album and Sean Watkins' 24 Miles album. I'd probably have to rate this higher than any of the Nickel Creek album's just for his departure from the norm. I strongly recommend this album.
1,I suspect he'll be embaressed about this in the future,"I believe Chris Thile to be the finest mando player the planet has ever seen. I was at a duo concert with him and David Grier a few years back which was one of the musical high points of my life. I expect to like some things from a given musition more than other things. I absolutly love Not All Who Wander Are Lost and Into The Cauldron. I love some of what Nickle Creek does but find some of their stuff quite uninteresting.As far as this cd goes, I think it's really a low point. When I bought it I didn't expect it to be my favorite (I'm not a big fan of recordings where one person overdubs everything), but I figured it would have at leaset a few very high points. It's like he's taken the elements I like least about Nickle Creek and added some stuff I like even less. I'm sure there'll be more great cd's in Chris's future. This, however, is one to forget."
2,What Happened?,"Chris Thile is an unquestionable virtuoso and an incredible musical magician. Even his album STEALING SECOND, done when a child, illustrates his creativity and technical proficiency with delightful results. Unfortunately, someone must have filled his head with compliments a few times too often, to the point where he seems to think he can do no wrong. This album is AMPLE proof everyone makes mistakes, and Mr. Thile made his biggest yet in doing this CD. There is the rare tune where his technical virtuosity and consummate creativity shine through, but they can't pull the weight of this release alone. It's the musical equivalent of walking around with his pants unzipped: didn't he have any friends willing to tell him the truth in time to prevent his embarrassing himself? An incredible disappointment."
3,Ummm.... Yeah,"I could only listen to it one time through (and that was a struggle). Ever since I met Chris at a release party, I've always been a big fan of his. This is truly a wonderful self-expression; however, it can be difficult to digest. I believe Ben Folds has done a better job in mastering the one man show. Nevertheless, it is genius."
2,The Wrong Idea,"What should one expect from an experimental new approach with an opening track titled ""The Wrong Idea""? Unfortunately, while I really appreciate Thile's stellar musicianship, this set doesn't work for me. It's just too odd and doesn't move me. I do REALLY like the rocking track ""The Believer"" with great searing lead guitar and an intriguing lyric, ""You can point & laugh; I'm sure he's used to that, using faith like an acrobat 'til the net breaks."" ""This Is All Real"" is an interesting homage to George Harrison that makes me want to break out Sgt. Peppers and play ""Within You, Without You."" ""Empire Falls"" has potential as a rocker if there were a more compelling tune for the lyric about a ""black Mercedes at the textile mill."" ""On Ice"" almost works with some nice mandolin. All in all, I welcome Thile's desire to experiment on ""Deceiver."" Perhaps he can get some help recognizing when it works and when it doesn't. Taxi."
5,I agree with reviewer Melanie...,"When I first purchased this CD I had Nickel Creek and Mutual Admiration Society expectations. Although I love both of the previously mentioned, I was pleasently surprised by Chris' genre range. Its good to have variety. Its the spice of life. He shows all of his musical interests. The jazzy ""Locking Doors"" which I assume is a take off of the ""As Good as it Gets"" character Melvin Udall, is wonderful. Also, ""This is All Real"" could easily be a Harrison song. The reviewer who stated that Mr. Thile would be embarrassed about this album in the future was totally off base. Were the Beatles embarrassed by Rubber Soul? Its called artistic growth.Kudoes to him for stepping out of his box."
4,Good!,Easy understanding and ideal for begginers with a lot of quilting patterns to create your own designs.
5,Buy it!,"I own this book and would never part with it. It is a comprehensive encyclopedia of patterns, along with directions and pictures. I donated many quilt magazines to Goodwill after purchasing this book, because it is all you need. There are more patterns in here then you could make in 1 lifetime! I enjoyed the full color photos and added directions on how to change the size of the quilts from wall-king size. Also, it has both rotary and template piecing directions."
3,Easy to read,Enjoyed the book. It is easy to read and can be done in segments. Not technical or overly intellectual. Could be inspiring. Has some helpful suggestions about play.
5,Magical. Mystical. Mesmerizing.,"While I love the early Blossom Dearie records for their simplicity, sophistication and wit, I also love this. ""Ladies Who Lunch"" takes you through a moonlit garden of bifurcating paths, ending in a tar pit of dinosaurs that she's nonetheless upbeat about. Incredible.The second track (Bluzette? I'm sorry I'm writing from an internet cafe in Hong Kong) starts out soft 'n sad 'n gentle and ends up rocking. How does she do it? She belts the final lines like a disco diva.On all the numbers the background muzik is right on. No, this is not just Blossom and a piano, although I love that. It's a bigger-yet-quieter production.I've listened to this album 1000 times already."
2,Tired Blossom,"Blossom's Verve and Capitol records are among my favorite, but Blossom's performance, and the arrangements of the songs on this CD are tired and lack spark-despite the Brazilian influences. The version of Wave is deadly-all 7 minutes of it. The cover of this CD speaks for itself. Blossom looks tired and the music reflects this mood. Come on, Blossom, wake up and give 'em the ooh-la-la. For now, stick with vintage Blossom."
2,okay,I feel that this story needed more action! It wasn't as interesting as it sould have been. It needed more characters. It seemed like the person that wrote it didn't put as much as effort as he could have. I'm not saying it was terrible but it could have been alot different. Maybe if the characters did more besides being in the same room the entire time they're house. It should have involved maybe him at the movies actually telling what he was doing it seemed too lame not to be too critical and all. I think that the auther should have made it more comical made it where people would laugh it seemed too serious. Maybe that was the way the auther wanted it to be but I think if the author wanted more attraction to his book he could have made it longer more comedy more action more settings away from the house over all it wasn't the greatest It could have been better!
3,"Starts slow stay's slow, but it's not to bad..","I somewhat liked the book. It stated off slow and really dident pick up.. But it had a great climax. It was a fun book to read, but I would read it before bed, because some parts will put you to sleep! There really isent any twist or turns, if there is they are very slow. But over all it is a good book to read. It's great for high school kids. Over all I enjoyed reading it!"
3,Could have been better!,I believed that the book was very well written and that Tennessee Williams is a great writer. I also believe that this was not one of his best books. I didn't like how Amanda was always on Toms' case. Amanda also sheltered Laura way to much which could have made her the way she is today. Scared and alone. The part with Mr. O'Connor was kinda pointless to get someones feeling all twisted and upset is not cool. It made me feel like I was going through what Laura was going through and there is nothing to be done about it.That messes with our emotions and thats could send someone into a deep drepression. The books could habve been better. Maybe I just didn't like the plot.
2,optimistic opinions,"How do I start? The glass menagerie shattered everywhere! It could just be the hype or my more 2002ish expectations, but I'd rather read the dictionary. I was looking for more strife and ""great, depressing strugle"". On the other hand it had a decent plot."
2,student opinions,"The glass menagerie was an ok book to read, but it started kind of slow, and had a predictable ending."
2,gentlemen callers,"In my opinion, this book wasn't really that great. The people in this story were not very down to earth, and they were annoying characters. This story was not an attention getter in my opinion. Amanda, the mother in the story, always called Tom, which is her son, selfish, and in all actuality, she was the selfish one. She didn't want Tom to do anything that he wanted to do. She acted like she was all knowing and that what she did was the only right thing to do.So in conclusion, i really didn't enjoy it so if you have another book to read....read it"
2,My Impressions On The Book,"The book kept me interested untill the end.Even tho there was no adventure or action in the book. I thought that the book had no ending. I would not suggest reading this book in the future.The book had a good story line, but ended no where. Leaving me in confusion.The gentleman caller was hypet up to be something that he wasnt. The mother was very annoying. She made me fustrated, and I wanted to put the book down.Overall if you have no life and are a boring person, you would probably like this book."
2,Glass Menagerie rating,"This story was boring!!! I didn't really like the whole story because it's not the type of book that I like to read. The reason I gave it 2 stars was because it had a good plot to it, but it doesn't really seem like a book that teenagers are interested in. The characters come off like the author wanted them to, because they were suppost to be annoying and they were, the mother espically."
1,this book sucked but it is a classic,"Ok, maybe it is a classic but, it does not deserve to be a High School required book, i mean the whole gist of the book was how horrible this one guys life was and honestly there are people in the real world with disabilitys like lauras and if i was them i would be depressed as hell after reading this book. and toms constant naging about how horrible his life was ruined the book and im not even gonna talk about the mother and her refusel to let her life even begin because she is to worried about a man in the family and she treated her son as if he was five, a bad message to all the to be high school mothers out therethis book sucked but to some it is a classic."
1,The Glass Menageria is descent,The Glass Menageria was a descent book but I wouldn't waste your money on it because its not very interesting. I am an action man so I really didn't dig it to much. If your into drama and like sad stories about a drunk or a crippled depressed girl who's mom keeps pressuring her to get out and find a man.Or if you like drunks that lie.This is the book for you.
2,Red Tide is dead tiring!,"I found the plot very good, but he just didn't do enough with it. The book was slow, and plodding, and I had to struggle to get through it. Thank God, it wasn't bogged down with detail and was relatively easy to get through. He used other author's names, such as Clancy, as characters in his book, hopefully to strike the readers' interest. It didn't work, at least, not on this reader. The story was about the old hardliners in Russia, trying to take back their country from the weak, liberals that sold it down the drain. The arch villain was a supposed descendant of Tzar Nicholas, who attempted to take back what he thought was his rightful place as the new Tzar of Russia, and unite all the former replubics behind him. As I said earlier; Good plot, could have been better done."
3,Giant Steps,"Michael Mahonen is excellent as the quirky teenager. Billy Dee Williams mumbles alot. On the whole I liked this movie because of the off beat style and music. Some of the minor characters were a bit overdone, but I enjoyed the message about ""being decent"" and setting priorities."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The makers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves for titling it after a great jazz album, Giant Steps by John Coltrane. This movie is poorly written and filled with inane dialogue--and it has a slew of bad actors. Billy Dee Williams (a good actor) really made a mistake with this turkey. He tries to channel the cool that came naturally to jazz musicians of the past but his performance is ridiculous and embarrassing. The only good thing about the movie is the few minutes of jazz that come all too infrequently.I can see why this movie hasn't been released on DVD--it's just awful."
5,Fabulous story for children,"This is an adorable story and Frances comes up with a clever way to solve the problem of being taken advantage of by a friend. The book was written in 1970 so the prices of tea sets and candy have gone up, but it's still fun. And $2.17 is still a whole lot of money to a little girl."
3,Try to find a tea set for $3!,"My daughter and I liked the way Frances used her head, but the story keeps pounding the three dollar price of the tea set, which is of course wholly unrealistic. We tired of it pretty quickly. I wouldn't buy another Frances title without being able to read it first."
5,A Bargain for Frances,An easy to read (Level 2) reader that teaches your child a valuable lesson in life. A fun book for you to read together. Well illustraited.

4,I want a hippopotamus for Christmas!,"All my 2 year-old son said for weeks before Christmas was, ""I want hippopotamus."" He told everyone. We found this for him to snuggle up with at night, and it's SO SOFT and snuggly. It was a great find! Arrived in great condition and well before it was supposed to.Now he wants an elephant..."
4,Camper is back!,"In a day when a renion cd can mean that half or less of the original band is back, ""New Roman Times"" actually features all the original members of Camper Van Beethoven. And what an ambitious cd it is. The songs, while great on their own, form a concept cd that is a dark political parable for our times. Everthing you expect from Camper is here: instrumentals, humor, politics, and psychedelics. But this is also a mature group and they bring influences of their individual work since 1989's ""Key Lime Pie."" In fact, Cracker's John Hickman plays on the cd and co-wrote ""That Gum You Like is Back in Style."" This is the tightest the band has ever sounded. Just take a listen to ""Civil Disobedience"" for example. For Camper fans, this is the reunion we've been waiting for. Here's hoping it reaches new fans as well."
5,An extraordinary CD,"This is a brilliant collection of songs that are diverse, pleasantly strange, and ingeniously conceived. Such songs as Might Makes Right are so well-done is gives you chills. Yes, I'm a fan of Cracker and find David's tunes the strongest here, but I can even appreciate the 70's prog-rock inspired excesses like White fluffy clouds listenable. This album seems to have come in under the radar but is still a wonderful CD. Cracker went its course, apparently, and now Camper is better than it ever was. Whatever caused them to go their separate ways have made them even better now 15 years later."
5,Been Through All Kinds of Changes,"Wow. Fifteen years since Key Lime Pie and CVB are back, and boy did we need them back. People will say it sounds like a more mature Camper, a bit like Cracker, a bit like Monks of Doom and really they will all be right. The band members have all matured and been all over the map as musicians since Camper first broke up in 1990, and this record really shows this off. More importantly, it took the guys two years to make this CD, it's no quick cash-out, and in those two years they have really tightened their sound on tour. We get some manic, throwback instrumentals like R in R Uzbekistan, dreamy country pop in That Gum You Like, and some ska stylings in Might Makes Right. Throughout all of this we are treated to some fantastic lyrics (what we've come to expect from CVB) and Jonathan Segel's return to the fold on violin. Listen to the samples folks, you can't go wrong with this one."
4,plain old camper,"This is just your standard, run-of-the mill CVB album, showcasing an innovative band with a continually evolving and changing sound. In this case, that is a very good thing!"
3,Not up to par....,"It's great that CVB has returned from a long, long hiatus, and to know that there still are original, talented bands in a world dominated by crap music. However, this CVB release, as great as it is that they are making music, is not one that I would consider ""great"", or even ""good"" for that matter. Most fans will automatically give this album 5 stars just because it's a CVB release, but as hard as it is, I simply can't because this is a dull album. Song after song, there seems to be some missing element, I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's there. Maybe it's the fact that the violin is in every song, and can get a tad overdone. Maybe I shouldn't have expected an old-school styled album, or maybe I just don't understand this band anymore, but whatever it is, I'm left disappointed with this album."
5,Morrissey's Re-emergence. How Amazingly Fantastic.,"I am thrilled to see Morrissey back in the spotlight. As I feel myself getting older I now appreciate Morrissey's lyrics as I can more deeply connect with his literary references and influences, then when I was 14 in 1984 and it was the Smiths, not the solo artist I was a fan of. I can now connect with the obvious works of Oscar Wilde, the creative 'A Taste of Honey', and after living in London for two years I can connect with his 'Northern' ethos/pathos and his championing of the 'Northern' (UK) woman.What more can I say that has not already been said? Morrissey is a love/hate artist. I have never met someone in the middle (they obviously exist but Stephen Patrick does not elicit lukewarm responses).Damon"
1,cheech n chong hat,"Tiny hat for an XL size, no buckle or anything at the back to adjust. Waste of money!"
4,Sweetly nostalgic yet fizzy,"A great budget priced compilation, this mixes most of Clark's biggest hits with some obscure and previously unreleased tracks. Tony Hatch was the composer/arranger/producer who helped create Petula's phenomenal success with many of his tunes, and this album showcases that very particular 60s English sound. A bargain."
4,The picture is of a different bit...,"It works fine, but this bit is a 1/4"" rounding over bit.

2,Lack of resume makes player worthless,"This player does everything right, except for one minor detail which would probably take 10 minutes for a programmer to fix! The resume is HORRIBLE. First of all, it does not correctly work when shuffling (and sometimes not at all). Say you are listening to one of your folders, like classical in shuffle mode. Everytime you turn off the player, you have to navigate through the godd*mn menus to get back to the folder you want to resume. I wanted to use this player in the car, but the lack of resume makes this pretty much a pain ... I can't believe something this basic is missing in this player. I would love it if not for this huge failure. ..."
1,"Horrible MP3 player, good price.","If you are looking for a good MP3 player, this IS NOT the one for you. It is the worst MP3 player ever, it freezes on you, mine even stopped working. The downloads for this player don't even work, it can't detect my MP3 player, DO NOT BUY!"
3,"Bulky, difficult controls, cheap headphones","This is my first MP3 player, so I have nothing to compare it to but my PC.With that said:LIKES:1: It's only $300 for 40gigs2: USB 2.03: Plug and play with XP4: Comes with Musicmatch driver that makes Syncing with your PC super easyDISLIKES:1: It's bulky & heavy2: The main control used is very difficult to make go ""down"", especially with the case on3: Not very loud4: The headphones do not sound high quality (but fit me just fine)I'm returning it and will probably go for an iPOD"
2,I have problems with it,"Ok, so the interface isn't great and the buttons don't work all that well (not that I had significant problems with them). My real problem came when I actually tried to listen to music on it. The player has frozen on me twice now. Once it is frozen, short of voiding the warranty, opening the case and removing the battery, there is no way to turn it off and get it working again. you have to wait 10 hours or so for the battery to die and then recharge it. Obviously this is unacceptable. When it is working, i don't have any real problems with it."
1,Expensive Paperweight,"I would have rated this item 0 stars, but that wasn't an option. This jukebox blows. I should have realized there was a reason why 40G was so affordable. I have only owned the hunk of junk for 5 days. It is going back this weekend and I do NOT want an exchange. I have spent hours downloading the latest software, copying my music to the jukebox, resetting it at least 10 times after it freezes up. I have never been so frustrated. I have owned 3 RCA mp3 players in the past and I loved them. My suggestion for RCA is to stick with the mini mp3 players and get out of the jukebox business. I ordered a Nomad online yesterday. I can't wait to try out a REAL jukebox."
1,HELP!,"I hate to make this into a ""help me"" page but this is kinda an emergency. After two months of good usage, I keep getting a ""Failed to load files! Reset unit to resume operation.Update lyrahd system files if problem persists"" after it stays on the ""RCA Lyra"" boot screen for about 10 seconds.I can't update the system files b/c the lyra can't boot fully, meaning the computer can't recognize it when its connected. Also, resetting it using the little hole doesn't help either--it just turns it back on/off. A dumb girl needs help, if you could take 10 seconds to email the response at alexpais@yahoo.com . thanks in advance."
2,My experiences with the RCA Lyra...,"We bought this MP3 player around Christmas 2003. We did this at the ""spur-of-the-moment"", dropped $300 for it. We loaded the player with a lot of songs on it--and about two to three weeks later, we started having problems with it. The buttons came defective--they were hard to press, and didn't always function like they should have. The player often froze in the middle of a song--it just sat there, screen frozen, no button would do anything, nothing we could do except to let the battery run down and recharge.[...]The new one (the second one we had) works MUCH better than the one that replaced it, but still occasionally freezes in the middle of a song (but not as much as the old one did). We found that we could reset with a paperclip--but still somewhat annoying. This player is currently hooked up to our home stereo system, where it suits us fine--but the next thing we're buying will be an iPod!"
1,TWO IN A ROW DID THE SAME THING- FROZE TILL IT DIED,"so i purchased this product based on rca's rep for being a good quality and the fact that it seemed like a killer deal... which is where i went wrong- turns out the rca rd2840 lyra doesn't always turn off when the on/off button is pushed, it instead freezes up until the battery runs out- kind of a bummer on a long flight or drive.. or just considering the investment. i exchanged it for another one that did the same thing again. i've built computers, run websites, and delt with electronics of all kinds and this is one of the most poorly designed products. Oh, and about the 10 hours battery life... within 10 minutes of using it the battery indicator already started dying- i'd say on a good day you might get 6 hours life..."
1,dont bother buying it,"I bought this 4 months ago b/c i couldnt wait to buy a regular ipod that wasnt in stock.the worse think i ever done.the player doesnt work,i call custumer serv. they give me the run around. it is terrible and now it gets worse i tried to exchange it at the store i got it and they said it was to late b/c i was missing sum papers that came with it all i say is stick with teh ipod.the reason y its more money than teh RCA b/c u pay for the Name of Apple and theyr great service ( i have a ipod mini and im loving it) buy the real thing.. not a knock off"
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"I am a pretty avid music listener (22GB CD library) but not an audio snob so my comments are from a practical side only. This player is a piece of crap. I constantly had problems with it locking up. It is also very sensitive to the initializing process when you make any changes. Never did get it to work with MMJB. Manuvering through the menu's was not intuititive. I took it back after 3 days and got the iPod. Now there's a fine piece of equipment. Face it.. this is a luxury item. If you can't afford $500 for and iPod, you probably can't affort $300 for the Lyra. Put out the extra $200 and get the iPOD. I promise you won't regret it."
2,Very Slow,"This thing is very slow and it constantly freezes (at least the one I had). Also, it is too expensive to be such a piece of crap. (...)"
1,Very disappointing,"The documentation is weak with this product and it is very confusing to figure out. Worse,I recieved a player where the enter button does not work, making it impossible to use the player. Amazon informs me that this item is not eligible for return so now I am stuck with a $250 paper weight. A terrible choice, don't do it!"
4,Great !!!!!!! but need software improvement......,"I would be great if all the functions that are added to the playlists (artist-album etc.) work2 the same way with the ALL FILES MENU :1-The folders are not sorted correctly2-You cannot add songs to likes/dislikes.3-If you play your songs from the ALL FILES menu it wont remember the last song played after you turn off the device, even with the new software (december 9)4-If you go back/up from a folder it doesnt remember in wich folder you were , so you have to go from the first folder to the one you were in (imagine if you have a lot of folders )5-If you are listening to the last song of a folder i doesnt continue with next folder.I mention this because i have 300+ discs and i already have my collection organized in foldersArtist > Album(s) formatthats why i like to use the ALL FILES OPTIONS, i use this format with other devices so im very familiar with that."
5,Rca Lyra 40gb player (awesome),"This Mp3player is awesome besides it having 40gb to hold a lifetime for most people of music music it is really easy to use with great features.Its great it includes graphic eQ great big blue display, chromeed out heavy duty body.The size is perfect it's not to big not too small fits anywhere.It can hold3000 40 minute cds on it or 50 days of music.This is your best bang for the buck don't go out and buy an Ipod 40gb that cost 400.00 this is a much better value. The headphones are excellent nice and small earclip phones.The player pumps out tons of juice it is totally capable of runing studio headphones or any headphones with out using a headphone amp.Comes with easy to use instructions make sure you do the tuteral.Comes with car kit too and car ac adapter.If your thinkin of buying it, buy it,i strongly recommend it . Enjoy"
1,I smashed mine to pieces out of frustration... Good Luck!!!,"I don't recall when I've had such a frustrating and disappointing experience with a piece of equipment before! I downloaded about two dozen albums and a few zillion old time radio shows, in hopes of being able to listen to them on my long drives. I'd push the buttons and it would take forever for anything to happen. Then it would tell me there was an error, but of course, no explanation for why or how to correct it. Why can't people learn how to simply communicate? Sure, I lost money on it, but I can't tell you how much I enjoyed smashing it to pieces and ripping the guts out of it! I guess I'd have to say, it was well worth it... 40 GB's is worthless if it won't play anything! It's heavy and the buttons are designed for some delicate flower... You can have it!!!"
5,Very informative text with may interesting asides,This book is one of those books that when you start to read it you can't put it down. As well as the main text there are interseting asides that take you behind the scenes of the the lifes and times of a warrior race that was both bloody and brutal as well as being artistic and restrained. Mr. Cook has written a wonderful narative that take the reader inside the Samurai's world.
3,Comforting Piece of Social Research,"One Nation After All is an excellent analysis for a fascinationg social research project focusing on the American Middle Class.The study and subsequent analysis is a well thought out, detailed work packed with citations and comparisons.As an added plus, the study shows that overall, the American Middle Class is basically a tolerant, reasonable group of people who prefer NOT to tell others how to live their lives.For the uninitiated, research papers are writtin in the passive voice! This may require some adjustment on the part of the reader."
3,Alternative alternative views,"Though I have not read this book, the last review begs for a response... if you are interested in accounts that go beyond the red and blue divisions and explore similarities, I recommend ""Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America"" by Morris Fiorina, a Stanford political scientist.""Culture War?"" is a marvelous little book, arguing that the great majority of Americans (i.e. all American citizens minus political elites and extremists) really agree on most of the issues we are often led to consider divisive and insurmountable. I don't personally swallow Fiorina's argument whole, but it certainly contains a lot of truth and valid arguments. In either case, it is a refreshing and thorough alternative view - concise and wonderfully smooth to read, too.As I have not read the Wolfe Book, I'll go with the average in terms of stars, don't take the rating seriously."
1,Almost impossible to read,"The author appears not to have intended for anyone to actually READ this book. Its sentences are horrendously overlong; those few meanings which aren't badly obscured by the turgid writing are overly subtle, and in many cases underwhelming. Don't bother trying to read this."
2,"It's not LIKE a term paper, I'm DOING one on it!!","The previous customer review said the book reminds him of a college term paper gone wrong. Well, I'm currently working on a college term paper on this book, and I'm looking for lots of background info or else this paper WILL go wrong!"
2,bwahahahahahahahaha,"They say everything with the word ninja in it is cool! Hey if you love ninja strom that much to buy this then by all means do so. But if you aren't at total freak about it and neither is the person you are buying it for ""THEN DON""T BUY IT, I REPEAT DON'T BUY IT!! I laughed my but off when they gave this to my brother he is 11yrs old and he didn't like it. He threw it at me so I looked threw it. It really wasn't all that bad but not something worth getting for a B-day or any other day. Hope this helped."
2,"cute, but very uncomfortable","I was excited to receive these shoes! They were such a good buy and I loved the style! As soon as I tried them on,(I think I may have had them on for 10 seconds), they were extremely uncomfortable! Way too tight around the toes and if you have a narrow foot, you'll probably walk right out of them. I hated to have to send them back."
3,"A Medley of ""DANCEABLE"" Gospels.","This selection of music is good enough to minister to all kinds of listeners,since it has both traditional and contemporary gospel rhythms well represented. It has mainly mid-tempo to high-tempo beats and is good for the gospel music lover who wants to ""groove"" to his music!"
2,Just OK,"This does not have the version of Dream a little dream I wanted. The rest of the songs are quite dated and out of fashion. However, if you trully love Momma Cass Elliot. This may be the album for you. Not for me."
2,Don't give the fans what they want,"It's dizzying the amount of times some of these tracks have been released on CD, yet Elliot's THE ROAD IS NO PLACE FOR A LADY album remains unavailable on CD. Yes, this collection does include a couple of selections from that LP (though not the best track, ""Saturday Suit""), but fans want the ENTIRE album.We get a previously unreleased song here. It's somewhat slight, but a breath of fresh air amidst the many songs the many fans already own on many other CDs. Which begs the question: Why not give the fans even more rarities? I'll bet there are other Elliot tracks in the vault. Plus, there are a number of singles and B-sides from the early seventies unavailable on CD."
5,Lectures on the Book of Revelation by H. A. Ironside,"This book enhances my understanding to the future things this world will experience in the last days, and I believe Harry Ironside to be an excellent author and authority on Revelation and the subject of prophecy."
3,Great Music & Musicians. Poor Production,"The singers are excellent; especially Annick Massis, Julia Kleiter and Veronica Cangemi. The rest of the cast is actually very fine. To be honest the singers carry the day. The conductor and orchestra are also on a very high level. WHAT'S WRONG? The production! Strange costumes, some bizarre staging , fair set and cuts in the score! Why would Salzburg condone cuts in a great early work of Mozart - a genius? The music is beautiful... one glorious aria or number after another. The music and all musicians deserve FIVE STARS; only the production and cuts bring it down to THREE STARS! Don't miss Annick Massis or Julia Kleiter in any of their other CDS or DVDS. I'll listen to this DVD again just because of the singers, conductor and orchestra."
5,Best product,My son uses this. Bought it for him for Christmas. Best price on the web. Arrived quickly. He was thrilled.
2,Perfect Rx,"Not perfect! Has distinct fishy smell. I am sure product is good for you, but I could not drink due to smell. Husband also tryed it, but did not like that product was hard to mix & chunky. I found that it is best shaken, but ended up giving to coworker that runs marathons."
2,Deceiving title,"The title does not justify the contents of the DVD. demonstration of the stretches are done through computer simulation and the entire DVD is more like a power-point presentation where you have to continually press the buttons on yr remote control to gain access to the stretches. The stretches shown are extremely basic and you are not taken through each stretch and proper form and technique is not demonstrated. If you're a runner and need specific pre run and post run stretching, then this DVD is definitely not for you. It has not assisted me in any way whatsoever."
5,Leading Rather then Commanding,"In my last job I worked for the owner, a manager of the style who believed that if your were always concerned about getting fired today that you would work harder. His style yielded a lot of turnover, much grumbling and a family business where senior positions were held by family members who were loyal regardless of their competence.This book is based on observations of businessmen who have gone beyond the 'my way or the highway' approach. These new managers are not so concerned with their own status that they refuse to listen to their employees. They look for change, especially as they see the world changing around them and forcing ther companies to change to stay competitive. Here are companies and managers that estalish a firm position towards hiring and keeping talented people."
1,Politically motivated work,"Although there are some things that are correctly noted, the book is politically motivated and written to evoke hatred and controversy. Authors like her only seek basal pleasure in hatred and controversy because they want to reap money from others.This is really a very disappointing work, but then any idiot has the right to publish."
1,Falls flat,"I was eager to read this book after I saw the author's summary of her argument in Frontline. But I was disappointed in how she develops her case. Apparently, she does not possess adequate knowledge of the Indian scientific literature, and she relies on summaries of it which are out of date or have been refuted. This is one of the three legs of the stool, and as it falls, the general argument becomes invalid.Nevertheless, the question of how Hindutva groups use modern science for a variety of political purposes is most interesting. If only it was examined by a scholar who knew the Indian science part of the evidence."
1,Meera Nanda sees no irony in her own life,"In short, Meera Nanda is arrogant and blinded by her own Marxist superstitions.She flaunts her current employment with Templeton Foundation, but apparently sees no contradiction in being a super-rationalist who remains employed with an organization that gives away the ""The Templeton Prize For Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities"" including for ""thanksgiving and prayer"" !! So, when will you write a trope opposing your employers' supersition, Dr.Nanda?""Yoga"" and ""Ayurveda"" are unproven techniques ? That is not what is experienced by hundreds of millions of practitioners across the world. Dr. Nanda believes that the only acceptable standard of proof is her personal ability to comprehend any phenomenon.Don't waste your time or money on this book. Use my mistake as your proof :-)."
1,Dorman 741-717 Honda Accord Front Driver Side Power Window Regulator with Motor,"I bought a Dorman window regulator for my car. It didn't work within days after I paid to have it installed. According to my mechanic, Dorman is supposed to make good regulators but they should last more than a couple of days.Now I have to pay to have it taken out and will end up going with a dealer part. Very unhappy about this."
4,"This book is OK, nothing spectacular......","As a die-hard Clooney fan, this book didn't tell me anything new. If you don't know much about him, this book will clue you in a little. The information appears to have been gotten from magazine articles that written previously. A few good pictures."
1,Nice try but. . .,"This book is full of problems. I hate to bash an aspiring author, especially one who obviously admires Sherlock Holmes, but Fullenkamp's pastiche deserves some criticism. It was amazing to learn that Dr. Watson's name was Johnathan and that the structure at 221 Baker Street was not laid out anything like Conan Doyle described it. Fullenkamp also has the building with ""upper rooms inhabited by Mrs. Hudson and a few of the other tenants."" The conversations have an American character and do not sound like 1880s England. Fullenkamp has Holmes and Watson doing things completely out of place and character, such as rushing into a room with pistols drawn and then rolling on the floor into firing positions. Watson has named his pistol ""Mildred."" There just are too many elements of James Bond and Bruce Lee and not enough of the Holmes and Watson of the Canon. Perhaps I expected too much of a book the author paid to have published.--""Samson"""
2,Sherlock Holmes and the Adventrue of the Three Dragons,"A quaint mystery book that was a good quick read. However if one were looking to meet Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in yet another adventure, you'd better look elsewhere. The author missed the essential Sherlock Holmes. For one, throughout the book both Holmes & Watson referred to Inspector Whittington as Charlie. While Watson may have occasionally lapsed into a first name basis, only on rare occasions would Holmes ever do so. Both their nature and the times would have required the more formal Inspector Whitington. Mrs. Hudson's home and Holmes and Watsons abode were altered from the orgiginal Conan Doyle descriptions of the 221B Baker Street residence. These are only two examples of where the author missed the essential Sherlock Holmes. Readers will no doubt find others as they read the book. It's a good little mystery book, but just not an essential Sherlock Holmes. Hopefully the aurthor will improve if he writes another Sherlock Holmes book."
1,Terrible,"An utter waste of money.The author clearly hasn't a clue about the Sherlock Holmes series; the book abounds in inaccuracies, unlikely dialogue (old boy!), signs of a lack of basic research about Victorian England and simple inconsistencies.This doesn't even cover the utterly changed personalities of the protagonists, though I suppose ""Johnathan"" Watson could be forgiven some of these.........The plot is pretty ludicrous and the Fu-Manchu crossover has been done far, far better by Van Ash.All in all, avoid the book and the author. The only reason it gets a star is Amazon doesn't have a lower rating."
3,"Pleasant Victorian sci-fi, not for Holmes purists...","This was a fun read, and the author has a strong descriptive style and energetic pacing which transports you (along with Holmes and Watson) to various Victorian locales including the Paris sewers and a Mary-Poppin-like flight through London's night skies... and the villain and plotline are imaginative. But too many liberties (see other reviews) are taken with the Holmes/Watson relationship, dialogue, and personalities to satisfy the real Conan Doyle fan. If you can forgive these, it's a pleasant way to spend a plane flight - and I've always been partial to Victorian science fiction gadgets, which abound here."
4,A reader from Ohio.,"Although I am a Sherlock Holmes purist, I decided this book was very well written and displayed a wonderful imagination. The reading was fast, the plot very interesting. This book held my interest, even though it did take a different path from the original Holmes and Watson. Overall, I was very delighted and impressed with the writing style."
4,An excellent first book,The suspense coupled with vivid descriptions thoughout this novel make it difficult to put down once you begin reading. The characters emerge with real personalities and not as mere players in a drama. This is an excellent beginning of a writing career which will hopefully continue.
3,Pretty but shallow,"All the sounds are very pretty, and the music is beautifully sung. But the majority of the disk is devoted to the Sarum Chant, which is remarkably uninventive and undifferentiated. Moreover, the non-Sarum items are quite awkwardly interwoven. These items do include several numbers by the wonderful William Cornysh, but they also include named composers whose music (judged by this) sounds much like the Sarum Chant, albeit (sometimes) more inventive. Not impressive. If there was a point to this compilation, I don't know what it was. The ""fayre ladye"" theme is a weak one."
3,Hard to Operate,"We love the look and construction of this dragon puppet, but it was not clear from the picture that this is a FINGER puppet. The puppet is large and hard to operate with your finger. My husband commented, ""Nothing ruins the puppet illusion like seeing the rest of your hand."""
5,Medline T.P. 2 ply,"fast to ship (5 days) great value for std size full roll. This is a Good grade of T P . I don't care if it is a ""green"" product! the price is good,and it works as intended.low Cost & value is what what we needed, and this T P is better than what we have gotten in the past from the big box, & local business supply outlets.We think we found a good deal and we will buy again as needed. (it is strong,soft, & not brittle or waxey like)No BS, ...just buy it....it just plain good old 2 ply T.P."
4,Money-saver,"It's no Charmin-Ultra when it comes to softness, but my toilet is happier, and I'm glad to save a tree, and spend less money on this deal than at the discount store."
1,More brown than green,"I don't understand what was so ""green"" about this product. It didn't let me use both sides of the paper when extra use was needed, that is not a good way to save the environment. In the end I learned buying the stuff that is five dollars rather than twenty-five is far more worth it when I can use that extra twenty on burritos and beer."
2,Toy Does Not Come As Represented,"The toy would be excellent but there is a problem. The picture shows a wonderful figure with a REVOLVER. However, when you order and receive it, the toy comes with a .45 handgun. Now, that may not seem like a big deal, but when you have a ten year old who sees the picture and WANTS the revolver, there is a problem. I sent the original order back, explained the situation, and they sent me another one with a revolver, which I in turn sent back."
3,"cute but ""MINI""","Look at the dimensions before buying. The description does say ""MINI"" This case is smaller then pictured.It is made well & it is cute."
1,Not about cabling and definetly not for contractors.,"Just look at Table of Contents. This book offers very little practical input on actual installation of cable. It's better suited for network topology design and review of network equipment,protocols, and theory in general. Almost half of the book is an assortment of RFC's and protocol standarts. Regurgitation of irrelevant information. Get 'The Cabling Handbook' by Vacca or 'The complete guide to network cabling'."
5,Facilitated Stretching,Facilitated Stretching 3rd Edition is a very Helpful Addition to my practice.The explanation's and Visual diagrams are excellent!This is a very easy protocol to follow.
2,Dangerous,"Although some of the assisted exercises might work well, I found many of the other stretches inflamed a number of joints after several weeks on this program. The solo stretching exercises seem to be poorly researched."
1,This book is hard to follow.,I much preferred The Wharton's Book on stretching as it's practical approach was user friendly. This book should be updated.
5,Must Have,Probably the most often overlooked thing about exercise is stretching. This one is a must have book. It demonstrates facilitated stretching both as provided by a second party and as implemented by yourself. I have relieved years of pain by learning the proper way of stretching and this is an amazing resource for just that reason.
3,More to PNF stretching,Facilitated Stretching is good but...Pros:Helps a person to move muscles through a range of motionmakes one more aware of the lack of blood flow that happens to musclesa good system to learnConsno organized system for the whole body stretchingsuggest to hold stretches too longcan lead to micro tears in musclesWould suggest learning this system as part of your knowledge based
5,Jim Dunlop Jazz III Ultex,"These jazz IIIs are even better than the originals in my opinion! They have a brighter, snappier tone and can make even dead strings sound almost new again. They are almost impossible to wear out, It is more likely you will lose them before you can wear them out. They also have a nice matt finish on them that helps you keep a good grip on them. Since they are small, and would usually be easy to drop, this is a major plus. The only bad thing about these picks is that even though they are harder to drop because of the matt finish, they are very hard to find if you drop them on a dark stage."
5,Good for heavy playing,"These picks are just like the black Jazz III's, only they feel a bit meatier in your hand. Produces a slightly more bassy tone, and lacks the razor-precision of it's thinner and sharper older brother. Therefore, I would consider these best for heavier rhythm on the lower strings, yet they still do work better than most picks on lead playing. White powder on each pick to absorb sweat, nice idea but feels like touching a chalkboard and it wears off after the first use. Overall great picks with a ton of control and super strong, but I would still prefer the black Jazz III's for their versatility."
5,Fantasic pick for acoustic guitar!,"I want to start out by stating that this review is based solely on performance on an acoustic guitar, which I believe the sound of Ultex is well suited for.I have been playing guitar off and on for about sixteen years, mostly on a strat using the red and black nylon Jazz IIIs for playing blues, rock, and metal. I just recently became interested in bluegrass and traditional music, and quickly discovered that my old faithful nylon Jazz III did not give me the loud and snappy tone that I needed to stand out in an acoustic jam. I tried to use other Ultex picks by Dunlop, but none felt or sounded ""right"" because I had gotten so used to the smaller Jazz III size and pick bevel.If you are a fan of nylon Jazz IIIs but never cared for their sound on acoustic, I highly recommend these picks. You can't hide behind effects and EQ when playing acoustic, and these picks are wonderful for getting a good snappy tone and the volume needed to stand out when going unplugged."
5,best picks Ive ever used,"They are really surprisingly easy to use. Didnt have any problems switching over from big picks to these, so I found them very easy to get used to. They sound alot fatter than normal picks of the same depth. The ultex is really long lasting. I bought a 6 pack a year ago and Im still using the 1st pick I took out of the packaging, and its still sharp like new. They are transparent, so if you drop your picks alot you wont be able to find them easily. The jazz III logo sticks out of the pick, making it have a good grip. No complaints, easy to use, good sounding, and long lasting is always best."
2,I prefer red one,This has more friction against strings than red one. The grip feels nice. maybe this is good for acoustic guitars. but playing fast phrase with this is difficult cuz not as smooth as red one.
1,There Is An Alternative,"Sure, it's cheap but that darn earpiece just won't stay in your ear. I highly recommend the Jabra Classic Ear set with Gel-like attachments. It will stay in your ear comfortably! Make sure it fits your Model!"
5,An excellent and thorough book,"Charles Derry's book is based on his 1978 dissertation on the psychological structure of suspense films. His approach is entirely thorough and engaging with two excellent sections on the anatomy of ""suspense"" and ""thrills."" His theory of the sub-genres are thought-provoking and filled with examples to illustrate his ideas. He also provides a framework of literature for his reader by summarising the ideas of others including Altan Loker's book ""Film and Suspense."" It is the work of a writer that gives so much, it is incisive and an excellent book."
2,Nothing more than the book jacket,"I was very excited about this book and suggested it to my whole book club. I felt like everything I needed to know was on the book jacket! There was no suspense, just a tale of a really messed up mother and how terribly she treats her daughter. Very predictable."
5,if you want a true perspective...,"What I liked the best about the book is that it's told in students' own words -- students from a number of colleges commenting on topics ranging from how to schedule classes to handling homesickness to handling finances to getting along with that up-all-night roommate. You're getting the real scoop on college life from the people who are LIVING it, not what the admission literature says. As a student affairs professional, this is the kind of ""quick read"" resource I'm going to buy (on Amazon, of course) to make available to my students."
1,"Nice features, poor implementation","To summarize what everyone else pointed out but I ignored:* this unit runs very very hot* this unit just stops working every few days and requires a full restart which _may_ make it work again.Don't get it. You'll worry in the back of your mind about the heat, and you'll be irritated with the constant reboots."
3,Does what it is supposed to,"not the easiest config but not nearly as bad as other reviews would have you believe. Most of the ""doesn't work"" reviews can be attributed to user error.It's worked flawlessly on my xbox1 and 360 for 2 years. Strong connection, good speed to both the linksys and dlink routers i have used it with.Beats $99 for the ms 360 wireless adapter and works just as good"
1,Just awful. Never worked correctly.,"As others have indicated, this unit is just awful. Runs hot, very difficult to configure, my unit failed within a few weeks. Generally speaking I like DLink stuff because it's simple, down-to-earth, and easy to configure. What a mistake the DWL-G820 has been. It's even been discontinued at the store where I bought it -- too many returns. Pass on this one."
1,Did not work with Apple Airport Extreme and PSP LF-PK1,"I could not get this unit to work wirelessly with the Sony Locationfree LF-PK1 and an Apple Airport Extreme router.I WAS able to use the Buffalo Technology AirStation Turbo G High Power Wireless Ethernet to stream TV to PSP wirelessly and across the internet.Tech support was fine, the device was just incompatible with my apple router."
1,D-Link Customer Service Sucks,"I recently received a D-Link DWL-G820 wireless gaming adaptor for Christmas. I spent a few hours trying to get it working with my home network without any luck. I then called D-Link support 1-877-453-5465 during normal business hours, (not during the Christmas rush) and after waiting on the phone for over an hour I returned the item and bought a Linksys wireless gaming adaptor.Set up was difficult for me likely because I wasn't connecting to a D-Link wireless router. I'm not a network administrator, however I work in the high end computer industry and I'd say that I'm more knowledgeable than a large portion of consumers. The set up instructions, web interfaces, and wizards were poor.Needless to say I don't recommend buying anything from D-Link, or any other hardware provider that doesn't take customer support seriously."
4,Watchout for Silverlight,This is an excellent product for turning a wired ethernet port into a wireless port. I have used them for networking printers and for connecting a Linux machine that wouldn't work with USB wireless adapters. The only gotcha is that it cannot be configured with a connectiin to a machine that is using MS Silverlight. The only way I was able to figure this out was to find a reference to another D-Link device on their website that said it wouldn't configure with Silverlight. I turned off Silverlight and was able to configure it normally.
1,Worked for 3 weeks than stopped?,The game adapter quit working after 3 weeks and I can't get it to work anymore. Once I got it running I threw out the packing so I guess I can't return it.
2,Works for some time,"This works decently for about 3 weeks at a time, then freezes up. Powering off and on does not fix it. I have to completely reset it, and then set it up again for my wireless network."
2,Radio interference from xbox 360 wireless controllers,"While this Wifi Bridge works flawlessly with the ps2 & xbox, Logitech wireless controllers on both, it does not with the xbox 360's wireless controllers. The wifi signal dies the second I activate the wireless controllers. I'm working on trying to fix this, but if anyone has any advice, it'd be greatly appreciated !"
1,Does not work with DI-624,This game adapter does not work with the DI624. But works perfectly with a ***BELKIN*** ROUTER. How strange is that.
2,Was hoping for dome/mask...,"I was hoping for more of a sturdy (washable) plastic/rubber dome or mask type. I was slightly shocked when I opened it for the first time to see a piece of plastic and mouthpiece. The gloves are not the highest quality, but I can buy a pair of nitrile gloves from the drug store.I'm still glad that I bought it; a cheap barrier *shield* is better than none at all!"
4,SHIPPED QUICKLY,ITEM SEEMS A LITTLE CHEAP BUT WILL GET THE JOB DONE. QUICK SERVICE WHICH WAS VERY NICE RECEIVED THREE DAYS LATER!!!
5,CPR Keychain Kit,I use this product during training classes as prizes. We test the students verbally and they have a chance to win a kit. They love it because many people ask where to get these.
2,no happy with advertisement,"I taught a CPR class to a large group of people in a private company. I wasn't happy that the items had an advertisment phone number on them. If I had known, I wouldn't have received them. It was a cheap marketing technique."
5,"Awwe, good times good times","So this CD is wonderful..I forgot about the song ""Goodbye"" until I heard it again watching an online commercial for the last episodes of FRIENDS.. It made me really upset..Normally I would not be sad over a TV show ending..It happens all the time..But the song ""Goodbye"" made me feel like a part of my heart was being stolen from a sitcom? Listen to the sample..It lasts 29 seconds..But you'll wish you had a soundtrack to your life and ""Goodbye"" was the song played during the end titles.. Of course this is just one of the songs on this CD... the rest I feel just as passionate about"
2,"""Goodbye""","The song Goodbye was written as Plankeye was on the edge of breaking up. I saw Plankeye at C-Stone '98 and I was expecting to see the entire line-up but I saw Eric B. doing all the guitar/vocals and Wayne Everett (SF59, Lassie Foundation, etc.) on drums. Plankeye played the song Goodbye but Eric said that was the 2nd time they had ever played it and he was actually crying while playing (I have it on vhs). I was just noting that Goodbye was written as their break-up song but then the band decided to stay together and record another album (Relocation). That's my $.10"
3,Interesting....,"I gotta hand it to the last 2 boys, the cd aint bad. But as long as Luis and Eric keep the plankeye name, I cant help but be dissappointed. I'm a diehard to the core Plankeye fan and Scott Silleta will be missed. There are some good songs here and its worth the purchase, but if you want the pure stuff i reccomend their earlier stuff (the spark, commonwealth, and a couple hard to find ones[the one and only wasnt that hot though]). Luckily we can catch Scott with his new band Fanmail. While the golden days of Plankeye have come and gone, I will still listen to there stuff for a long time. May God bless you all."
3,"The Life and Times of Bill Smith, Inventor of Aspirin","So this is the new Plankeye. It seems like whenever bands lose their lead singers, I lose interest in the band. It happened with Newsboys, and now these guys. And the sad thing is, I don't like Scott's new band Fanmail. But this is not about Fanmail. This is about THIS! Relocation's got some well-written songs (I liked the first one), but for some reason I always have to turn it off half-way through or I'll get a headache. Not a good sign. Maybe just the songs tend to get repetive or something..... I'm not sure. That's my warning, though; either take it or buy this album."
4,Excellent !,I think it is very good for advanced as well as stater users of the model. It gives the basics regarding theory along with some excellent tips for modeling.
4,For a Water Pro - Not for Newbies,"This book is a bit overwhelming at first - both size and complexity. However, it needs to be in order to thoroughly cover the topic. Someone familiar with the field will find it useful and informative - and even fun to read at times. A novice or student reader may bog down in some of the topics and with some of the detail. It is a comprehensive treatment of water distribution modeling, planning and operations."
4,PE Preparation Material,"Having minimal experience with water distribution modeling, I've found this book to be quite informative and easily understood. As I prepare to sit for the PE Exam, this book is one of the books that I have used as a resource."
4,Advanced Water Distribution Modeling_Review,"This book is extremely useful in modelling applications. Easy to read,detailed an all round winner."
5,Review of Advanced Water Dist Modeling and Management,"Hastead Method's new book entitled Advanced Water Distribution System Modeling and Management is an excellent expansion and extension of its previous book, Water Distribution Modeling. I found the previous book extremely helpful and utilized it many times in my work. The new voulme has been expanded to inculde such important topics as: model skeletonization, demand allocation using GIS, water quality sampling and calibration, integration of modeling and SCADA systems, Genetic-algorithm-based calibration and design, modeling of variable-speed pumps,water system security and hydraulic transients, use of flow emitters and the integration 0f GIS with hydraulic modelng. I expect to use this new text extensively and stongly reccomend it to both beginning and experienced engineers."
4,An excellent textbook !!!,"Advanced Water Distribution Modeling and Management is not only a complete and current reference for professionals involved in water distribution systems but also an essential textbook for undergraduate and graduate courses. In fact, what makes this book different is that it contains from basic hydraulic concepts up to the most recent researches and experiences in a comprehensive language."
5,"The Best ""How To"" Book on Modeling","This reference has given us an edge in satisfying client needs from the simplest capacity study to the most complex model. It has helped make our competent modelers more efficient and the up-and coming modeler function like a pro. Many common questions and problems are anticipated and clearly answered. Because the book so thoroughly covers system management issues, I believe many parts should be required reading for water resources engineers."
5,Keep this book at arms length,I use this as a reference every day. An excellent follow up to the previous Water Distribution Modeling publication. The book provides valuable information from a small subdivision network to entire pressure zones. Haestad has another winner on my shelf.
3,Donw-home ramblin',"One of the most successful horse trainers in history, and the only trainer to win the Belmont Stakes five times in a row, tells his own story. Its language is about what you'd expect from a horse trainer in his upper seventies (at the time the book was written-- Stephens is now deceased). It's laconic, plain, understated. Easy reading. Probably interesting, if you follow horse racing, and especially if you remember Woody's streak of Belont wins in the early to mid eighties. If not, it probably won't hold your interest."
2,Did not get product ordered,"I had ordered the anti-greying formula. Someone put a bar code that read anti-greying but the label on the bottle did not say anti-greying. I did not want to hassel with sending it back butI was not happy.Further, I was with the product and it does have a strong odor. I had to wash the items twice. I must use less of it going forward."
1,"Can't get past the strong, unpleasant perfume smell","I like the Perwoll scent, but this Persil Power gel has a quite different and very strong perfume-like scent that makes me feel a bit queasy. It's very pungent and has filled my entire home since I started using this to do my laundry. I would definitely not buy this detergent again. I don't want to smell like this!"
1,Persil liquid washing gel,"Tried this horrible stuff. It pours straight through the detergent holder into the washer, so no presoak is possible,all the goo, no matter where you put it goes straight into the first wash cycle. It stinks and so do the clothes when ""finished"". It is so greasy it spreads over everything like the container, your hands; it is very difficult to remove by rincing, the smell stays for ages. Ugh!"
4,Power Spike Pro Beach Volleyball,"If you love volleyball, then you'll like this game. You get to pick your own 2 person team out of tons of famous pro volleyball players, both male and female (like Gaby Reese), and play in tournaments on beaches all over the world. There's a steep learning curve- it takes a while to learn how to time passes and spikes, but after a few games everything gets easier and actually pretty addicting. Considering that there are hardly any volleyball games out (and this is the only one for the Playstation), Power Spike Pro is successful as a volleyball game with all-around good gameplay, graphics, control controls and action."
5,Bass-Sax Duo Exposed,"Do not expect to hear something akin to Ray Brown walking merrily beneath a post-Parker alto. This music comes from the British school of free improvisation (as opposed to Free Jazz). As such it can be angular and jarring in places if its not the kind of music you're used to. Simon Fell is one of the treasures of free improvised music in Britain (although he has recently moved operations to mainland Euriope). A lot of his music fuses his bass playing with electronics and ""found sounds"" but on this recording he plays purely acoustically, alongside alto saxophonist Graham Halliwell. Halliwell is incredibly under-recorded - appearing on a handful of recordings by Fell - but this allows him to be heard clearly and without the distractions of other horns, showing what an interesting improviser he can be."
5,A must read,"If you are new to lean this is a must read. Questions & misunderstandings I had after other books were answered in this read. I ""get it"" a lot more now. You'll find you see your company in the examples he outlines at the end."
2,Disappointing,"This hardly qualifies as a book: not more than 30 pages including the covers!It includes lots of Lean Manufacturing concepts, but at such a superficial level that it's not much use. Go for Masaaki Imai's Gemba Kaizen which really is first rate."
2,Texan's don't like it!,"Not as good as others out there, especially the Kaizen Event Implementation Manual. No details or real life information."
2,Not much new information when you have read 'Kaizen' already,"The book Gemba-Kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'Kaizen' already. It gives not much new information. The only new idea in the book is the attention given to the 'Gemba', the place where the processes are performed. Imai is right to stress the importance of the Gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples to illustrate the Gemba's importance. However, only one nice idea is somewhat poor to fill a whole book. The major message of the book can be told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages."
2,Same Message New Buzzwords,"After reading Lean Thinking, The Goal and a few other books on manufacturing, I picked up this book based on the Amazon recommendation. I am sorry to say that the book was disappointing since it spoke of concepts that are well known. JIT, Kanban, Lean Manufacturing. Just like the hundreds of books on these concepts, this is a mere extension of the same concept and nothing in this book is different. I am used to reading both management and extremely technical books, but this one just could not hold my interest."
4,Pretty Durn Good,"I used to work at an electronics superstore chain, and this wasdefinitely one of the main speaker systems that everyone in thedepartment loved to hear. Crisp, clean sound, very good bass, and 4 speakers allowed for excellent gaming experience. Numerous customers would return saying how much they enjoyed these speakers after upgrading from their rinky dink ones that came with their computers. The only minuses that I had with it were that it didn't have an external, easy to access independent bass control (which can be solved by going into the sound card preferences if needed) and all the wires can get hairy, but with 4 speakers, that's understandable..."
1,Awful ...,I reeaaally didn't care for these ... pick something else ... anything else ... horribly overpriced!
4,Health Care Management: Organizational Design and Behavior,Book arrived within several days and is in very good condition Only slight highlighting and some penned underlining in first few chapters. Met my expectations or above.
2,Buzzwords and Citations,"This book was required for my Health Care Management course, but I wish they would find a different text to use.The authors seemed to take a handful of buzzwords, mix them up with citations from other texts, and then add a few of their own insights for the sake of originality. Here is an excerpt:""To acheive the organization's targeted strategic outcomes, the manager must create distinctive competencies within the organization by integrating resources, capabilities, and technology.""Although the book is flush with cited material, it seems to provide very little original material, and practically no personal anecdotes from the authors. The book reads as if the authors have practically no experience in the health care management field.The overabundance of citations, the lack of personal accounts, and the wealth of undefined buzzwords made this book thoroughly boring for me."
3,Health Care HLAD 455,I find the textbook is quite different from the 4th edition. My professor uses notes he created using that edition so it's difficult to follow. Other than that it's okay.
1,This Book Puts the Bore in in Boring!,"I have to echo the sentiment of some many others who have reviewed this book. The citations listed among the actual reading material is absolutely hideous! The idea of being innovative has been replaced by confusing instances of references that couuld have very well been placed strategically at the end of the chapter and/or the book.On top of everything, this is most drawn out, overly versed, double speak I've ever read! I am bored to anger, because it takes so long to read one chapter and I am totally disinterested after the first 5 pages. It makes me want to drop my course, entirely! I had a management course last semester and the book was enthralling, engaging, and actually got to the point of the lesson in less than 5 pages.This book gets a thumbs down from me!"
3,same as other books,"Similar to many other books on healthcare organizational behavior, informative and less waffle than other books I have encountered on the subject."
1,Shady company,"When I placed this order, I paid for expidited service however the company sent the book by priority mail instead. I placed my order on the 19th, it wasn't sent out until the 21st. I did not receive it until the 25th. A day late for my class. I contacted Amazon and the company, each blamed the other for the pricing difference. Neither refunded me the money for the difference. I would not trust this company again."
3,"OK, but with problems","Firstly, I love Panasonic - I have Panasonic everything - tv, dvd, vcrs, phones ... all with great results, so I when I needed a fax machine, Panasonic was my only choice.It's OK -- receives faxes ok (though 1 page faxes go to 2 pages some times), sends ok (though I'm having a problem now where the roller is apparently sticking).My biggest gripe is that the answering machine is unusable for me. It works, but the message I leave always has static. I replaced the machine and the same thing occurs (they sent me a replacement right away - GREAT service). So, I just use it for a fax and phone ... and bought a cheap answering machine ... that sounds a whole lot better."
5,Just What I've Been Looking For,"""The Pentecostal Pastor"" touches almost every area imaginable to the pastor/minister. While covering everything in a pastor's life, both professional and personal, this book gives practical information, ideas, and advice for ministers looking for an extra ""edge"" in their ministry."
4,Great Step by Step to a Budget that Makes Sense,"I discovered this book when writing The Complete Idiot's Guide to Grant Writing and found it terrific for learning how to put together a program budget. Having done this for years and having taught others how to do it, I found their approach clear and to the point. The many examples are especially helpful."
1,This isn't by Tex Avery!,"The cartoons on this DVD are ""in Tex Avery's style."" That is, they've used many of the tropes Avery did -- fast action, sexy women, (allegedly) goofy characters -- but managed to avoid anything resembling humor. The cartoons are annoying at best but more like painful to watch.There are plenty of collections of Avery's ACTUAL work on this site and elsewhere. Don't waste time or money with this."
1,i wish it worked...,"when I ordered this product it said that it would not arrive until after Christmas, which was fine since it wasn't a gift, but it arrived sooner than another product that I purchased at the same time that was a gift. so both made it by Christmas but the the lightbulb came several days before the Christmas gift came. That was really great, until I went to put it in and turn it on and it doesn't work! I was shocked! but in all the excitement of Christmas, I lost the receipt so now I can't even return it. I thought maybe it was the clamp lamp I had screwed it into, so I went and bought a new one but it won't work in that one either. so even though I got it really fast, it would've been really, really great if it wasn't broken."
4,A Little Glossed Over,"This enjoyable book gives a fairly comprehensive look at Isabella of Castile. It does a good job of presenting the relationship between Ferdinand and Isabella - a rather unique one for that period of time since Isabella had more power. The author obviously admires Isabella, not a bad thing since she had many admirable qualities, but this causes her to gloss over a few of the not so admirable things Isabella did. The Spanish Inquisition barely gets mentioned, and her treatment of the Jews is presented in a more sympathetic light than perhaps it deserves. Those short comings aside, I found this book to be highly informative and definitely worth reading."
3,excellent biography marred by poor copy-editing in kindle edition,"I have not seen the print edition, but strongly suspect that the kindle edition was scanned from a hard copy and lightly (if ever) copy-edited. There were many stretches in which there was a typo on every page. I cannot recommend the kindle edition. The book, on the other hand, is excellent: Isabella is fascinating and Stuart does a great job of providing rich details about her life and times."
1,Simply Terrible,"This book has terrible characterization and very little plot. There is really nothing redeeming about it. All of the characters are extremely two-dimensional. Also the title of the book is misleading. If you were intrigued by the idea of intelligent rodents, then don't bother reading the book: the protagonist never even sees a rat."
1,"If it was possible, I'd give this book a zero!!!","I'm sorry, but this book is one of the worst stories I have ever come across. The book had only one or two mentions of the supposed 'smart rats' None of the characters were very well developed, and the main character was impossible to sympathize with. Don't waste your time on this one."
5,It was in GREAT condition. My daguther loves it!!!,It was shipped quickly. It was in great condition. We watch it about every day. It's my horse loving daughters favorite!
5,Great Cartoons,My kids love this cartoons. They are cute and funny. They are clean and great for any age. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
4,Edward Hopper,"A gorgeous book with a well-written, informative and enjoyable text. Obviously I wish there could be more color in the book--but it's an older book and they couldn't do as much color then, and I doubt that could be upgraded for a reprint edition at half the price.The size is a great factor, too--the book is huge and you get the feeling you're looking at the actual size watercolors in that part of the book."
5,The best astrology book for teens you could find!!,"This book is the best book teens anyone could find! This explains what a astroloy is, who you are compatible with, what carrers you should look into, and much more! It had the best graphics ever and the pages are fantastic! All in all this is a great book that you should definitely check out."
2,Recycle bin,"This book is a reedition of two guides that were provided at Customflix as free mailing. Both are well written, quite informative and deliver, but there's nothing new in this book to justify the price (and it's cheap!), apart from a discount code (25% for CustomFlix On Demand).Don't get me wrong, Giles and Bosko are gods, it's full of info, and Customflix is the best thing to happen in indie cinema since DV, but there's nothing new if you read the DVD Nigthmares and Ten Tips to Film Distribution. Have a look at Bosko's Independent Film Marketing Handbook.If you want to save your inkjet or have no access to internet, go ahead, but the full book can be delivered, chapter by chapter, to your email from Customflix."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I don't know why I don't like this novel. It just didn't interest me at all. I have to admit that I only forced myself to read till 100 pages or so. Perhaps, the author didn't focus on the main plot enough. There were too many subplots, like missions that weren't really related to the main storyline. Although I got to learn a lot about SWAT team and medical stuff, I just didn't hook up to it."
2,Mentally ill heroine,The protagonist in this novel is so profoundly mentally disturbed that I'm surprized she could function at all in an ED setting or in the field--or that she would be allowed to do so. I work both in an emergency department and with emergency medical services in the field. Some one as nearly mentally unhinged as this girl would never be allowed to continue to perform her duties. She needs intensive counselling as well as consideration for inpatient therapy to come to grips with her issues. There will be no happily ever after for this chick until she deals with her abusive past that she has allowed to continue into her adulthood.Seventy five percent of this book goes on the head of the heroine and is both repeititous and tedious. The twenty five percent that is action is good but it's very sparse and spread out.
1,Pass on this one,"I guess I am swimming against the flow, but I'm not liking this book. The author is cramming way too much trauma into each page, so much so it is hard to follow. Then at the end of a day our heroine goes home and [makes love violently] without any soothing or loving talk and wrecking her home in the process. It's too much to absorb. And the little over the dining table scene with her father and bimbo #7 was a bit much and unreal.Give me a Robin Cook whodunit any day."
2,All right book,Bought this book for one of my classes in my MBA course. I thought the book is not well written and very confusing to understand. The definitions are usually not clear. I had to google some of the definitions to make sure I understood what the author meant. Also very boring to read.
2,Didn't do me any good.,"It was a book required for my MBA course, but it speaks to what seems like common sense. Read the Wall Street Journal if you want some insight on real world strategy."
3,Make Sure You're Keenly Interested In The Topic!,"I was surprised how little I enjoyed this book. I had been wanting to read a book on the topic for years, and finally got this one at a greatly reduced price...only to be bored by it for the most part. It is over 700 pages, and that is a big plus, in my opinion; but between the massive historical accounts, and the current personal accounts, I was left simply...bored. Nothing in it seemed particularly touching or intriguing. Maybe it's just me...maybe I'm not as interested in the subject matter as I thought I was at one time."
1,Horrible book.,"Horrible book that seems to be aimed at either making the audience vomit or titillated. The beastiality and the ritual circumcision scenes--Just because you can write it, doesn't mean you should. Bad usage of florid language. Just overall a horrifically bad book."
2,Not Recommended,"I think the author has talent, and I hope will one day write an interesting story really well. But this one isn't - even with dragons and sexuality and so on, it's boring. I would try another book of hers, outside this trilogy."
5,Breaks new ground,"Can't understand the controversy, but male readers seem to be the ones most likely to not ""get it"", if that tells you anything. Roc's marketing strategy is also bad, the cover artwork and Carey's endorsement works against this book.This is not light entertainment, but a more literary and cerebral read of thoughtful social commentary. Cross deftly weaves in subtle, understated commentary on not just sex oppression, but that of class and race, as well as the power dynamics of religious and political oppression on us all.As a new writer, it predictably, but occasionally falls down in a few patches, where Cross doesn't quite 'pull it off', but this is a minor criticism of an overall highly talented work by a new writer.My only concern is that this potential talent, will be pressured to deteriorate into sensationalist trashy 'Sex & Violence' in order to sell. Nonetheless I am curious enough to get the second installment. I hope I'm not disappointed, after such a promising start."
4,"good, but next one even better",This book really grabbed my attention from the beginning. The one thing I really didn't like about this book is that it's the first one so you have to learn all of the background history and a new language (which consisted of around 100-150pgs). The good thing is that J. Cross makes the history and language interesting as long as you have the patience to read through the first 100 pages. After that though the story and plot line get extremely interesting and I didn't put the book down. At the end of the book all I wanted to do was read the next one right away. I can't wait until this August!
2,Too much detail,"I love scifi and twisted romance but this book took entirely too long to explain things.. I like to imagine things, this book takes your imagination out.. she explains everything down to the color of the dirt... I've read over half the book and I still cant seem to get into it.. There are some amazing parts in the book and if she would have focused more on those then I think I would feel different.. But reading for 20 minutes about food or the definition of a word is jus not my cup of tea."
4,A grim but engrossing saga,"Like Philip Jose Farmer, Jane Gaskell, Samuel Delaney and other speculative writers who have defied genre taboos, Janine Cross's Touched by Venom pushes the boundaries of fantasy literature. This isn't a book for Anne McCaffrey fans; many readers may question its subject matter. But Cross's vividly realized world is as fascinating as it is disturbing. For the reader of adult fantasy, it offers many rewards."
4,Not a light read,"I picked this book up at my local library. My library really surprises me! I did find the beginning to be tedious and simply wished for simple English text so that I could enjoy a light read. HA! By the middle of the book I was immersed in this world, with its language, oppression, addiction and basic human frailty. I found it shockingly real as it parallels current human existence for many people. Fascinating. Cross' style however is somewhat ... tedious. Have I been watching too many movies? I will get the next book."
3,Cute boot but not high on comfort,It was hard for me to get my foot into the boots. They are very hard to get on. I had to wear a slick sock. They are decent quality and not bad for a clearance price. I would not pay regular price or have high expectations.
2,Hurt like hell,I bought these for my girlfriend a while back! She never wears them and says they hurt like hell.
4,Hot Boots,My only complaint about these boots is that I wish they were a little bit longer. They were hard to put on at first but after a wear to two they're alot easier for me to put on. But these are one of my favorite pairs of boots. They look great with jeans tucked in
3,Buyer Beware!,"This video is only 14 minutes long -- at these prices, there are better investments. If you need in-depth help, this video probably won't meet your needs."
5,Really good product,I gave it 5 stars because the Amla oil does what it is expected. My hair was shedding so much and it stopped it from shedding and it does a good job with the color of my black hair. However the smell is disguising it smells awful ...ewwwww. So I still have it and will use if I need too but until then it will stay in my bathroom cabinet for only emergencies but GREAT product.
3,The Smell is Terrible,"I tried this product and the smell was way too much not only for me but also for my husband. He told me never put it in my hair again, it smelt up the whole house. But after using it my hair looked and felt healthier. The second time I used it I mixed one capful of the Dabur Amla Hair Oil into 3 tablespoons of Lustrasilk Placenta & Jojoba Oil Cholesterol and put that on for 1 hour. It works great and the smell was so much better. My husband didn't even know I had it on and the results was excellent.I think it is too strong to use by itself but if you mix it with something else it it more tolerable."
1,Contains Mineral oil......,"Mineral oil is horrible for ethnic hair not the mention the bottle is so hard to open, but it's a good thing because I probably would've never noticed the contents."
1,Sooooo very horrible,"I don't understand how anyone has anything good to say about this product .The smell is so very horrible!! and it doesn't come out!! Its not just a scent its a chemical like stench. It made me feel dizzy and sick and will not wash out. I have had a horrible headache all day and have really bad nausea.I haven never smelled anything so bad!!Also, my hair didn't feel any softer, instead it felt less soft after washing it out. It feels crispy and dry. It also felt moist when the oil was still in. I didn't understand how this could be. Horrible experience"
1,has mineral oil in it!,Read the label...it has mineral oil in it. Stay away! I would not recommend this to anyone. Just a word of warning...
5,Great Spray,"We have been in the Custom Embroidery business for over 20 years. We have always used No Fray Spray for the back of the embroidery to make sure all is locked in. Never a problem with it, used for 20 years, love it."
1,Save Your Money,"In my opinion, this book is poorly organized. In addition, many parts of it were at odds with what I was learning from a native Japanese-speaking instructor in adult school. The CD is much too fast-paced to do any good, and the designations of ""CD"" and ""track"" were reversed, so I found it difficult to find what I was looking for. The Japanese-to-English and English-to-Japanese dictionaries were so small that I could never find a word I was looking for. Forget it!"
3,A word of warning about the kindle version,"I bought the kindle version of this book while traveling through Japan recently. The text was good and definitely helped me pick up some extra phrases. Unfortunately, the Kindle version doesn't have the audio support from the CD. This was a problem, because it meant that I couldn't hear the pronunciations. While the e-book does have text-to-speech activated, the pronunciation isn't quite right. If you want the audio functionality, buy the book, rather than the kindle edition"
3,"Good book, bad CD","This book does a wonderful job conveying Japanese through Romanji. The author has clearly worked very hard conveying his subject matter. However, my problem is with the CD. The CD comes with a number of tracks. Each chapter has ONE TRACK. Each track is divided into about 10 sepearate sentences/examples. What that means is at each example in the text, you have no way of repeating the sentence unless you skip back to the very beginning of the track, or if you use a slider bar on a computer audio program to effectively guess where the sentence would start. Also, there is no long pause b/t the examples. This makes using the CD effectively difficult. It is beyond important to hear the Japanese, since many Japanese words written in Romanjii are pronounced quite different then they are spelled, IE, vowel sounds are dropped from the end of some words. An example would be the verb ""desu"", being pronounced as ""Dess"""
4,Great entertainment,"While this movie is not super plausible and definitely not an Oscar winner, it is very entertaining between fast cars and racing and watching the actors strut their stuff. It is not one that you watch to enrich your life, you watch it because it's just a lot of fun and a great escape!"
4,Go Fast,"Movie starts off great, but for a car movie slows down a bit in the middle and at the end. But still some good action."
2,oog,"Paul Walker trying to act black was worse than seeing my Great Uncle Harry showering. ""Packing Heat"" is one of many references that made me want to scream while stuffing popcorn into my ears. This movie is oog. There is no other word to explain this atrocity of film making."
4,Value for money!,"This bit is perhaps not as good as a Freud brand router bit, but at half the cost of a comparable Freud bit, it offers excellent value for money. It is quite well machined and delivers a smooth finish. This is quite a large bit with a large radius so it suits shaping table edges the best. At least that is what I have used it most for so far."
5,Thumpin or what....,I'm glad that there is a group out there like this that can draw in the younger generation. By the type of music beat style that gets their attention with gospel. There are a few lines that I personaly wouldn've used but you still get the message of where they are coming from. Look out Winans faze 2 these four guys are great comp.
5,Mr. Carroll has written the book novices have needed.,"This book shows great insight as to the information the master and novice need before beginning any project.And he not only made it usable but easy to understand.The shop teacher at the high school where I work plans to order several for his students.Great work, MR. Carroll!"
3,I don't know,I bought this for the guys in my family. The guys will use it. There seems to bee some terrific information.
1,"Good book except for page 27 & other similar ""metric"" references","This author is in the dark ages with respect to the use of the metric system. As a country, we've been there / tried that. We can't help it if the rest of the world is backwards using the metric system! Why was at least a whole page WASTED in talking about this? How ridiculous! It is an okay book, but mostly black and white drawings and lots of text. Perhaps if the author, and Taunton, had spent more time with the content of the title and included some color in a book that is the same price as their other titles with LOTS of color, they would have had a good book."
1,Very disappointing,"I was looking forward to an in depth review of the cards and instead got a very fluffy basic overview. If you've never read anything about tarot, this book is a great intro or primer. The title is very misleading. If you're going to put mastering of anything in your title certain expectations should be met. This book falls horribly short. One star for a nice looking book. Zero stars for informational content. (unless you are an absolute beginner)"
3,christmas+teenageska=interesting,"I recieved this for christmas two christmas's ago and was very surprized at what i got. I had heared other songs from BOB such as Missions Trip To Mexico and Homeschool Girl which made me think bob would be something that i'ld like to have on my wish list. The cd is insainly lively *a good thing* and something great for those hyper christmas mornings. but i was sortof dissappointed that most of the songs sounded generally the same and in certain songs the girls tone wasn't very pleasent. don't get me wrong the cd was great what other group of 15-18 yr olds could make two cd's (20 songs) that are all ska and they sound somewhat different? if your a ska fan or punk fan go ahead you'll like it but if your more pickie and only like mxpx b/c they have some radio play b/c ""it sounds like blink on that song"" then this ones not for you ~:)"
2,"Might be good for some dogs, but not mine...",I got a sample of this product from Mud Bay. What can I say? My dog just doesn't care. It ranks up there with kibble. She's a picky eater. YMMV. She's a much bigger fan of Baa-Baa-Qs and Dogswell Chicken treats.
5,Good pick that's definitely worth the few bucks for anyone to try,"It's a good pick that's definitely worth the few bucks for anyone to try. I find it good when playing fast single notes. Bottomline, they're not bad. So give 'em a try."
1,Ack,"Hey Joe is filled with the youthful exuberance of that happy stupid kid that nobody ever wanted to hang out with in high school, but he still thought he was cool. No. No. No. How can you write a book about a guy with no problems and expect it to work? I didn't think it possible to do, but Neihart has written a book with no pathos whatsoever. It is a no-pathos-having book. Pathosless. The only interesting character is the nasty boy's home benefactor, and Neihart spends little time on her. This is a gay softcore romance novel or something like that."
3,"Great Style, Meaningless Plot...","This book achieved a lot as far as dialouge, style,description of setting (New Orleans), and the characterization of Joe, but as for plot, most of it was random wandering or the sub-plot of a trial that was disconnected and irrelevant. It seemed like the whole trial story behind it was thrown in just to make it the length of a novel. I liked the main character, and I wish the author would have concentrated more on him and his 'coming of age' story without the annoyance of the in between trial chapters. On the whole, however, I found the book readable in a lighthearted way, but it is just not a memorable or life-changing book. Oh, but the last three lines of the novel were incredible."
2,"Do yourself a favor, read 'Dream Boy' instead.","Hey Joe received some attention because it is one of the first novels of the nineties to present the story of a relatively happy, relatively adjusted gay teen going about his day, a gay teen who is not going through a huge family drama and/or a coming out crisis. This is notable, but Hey Joe is pretty forgettable. It has some strong images of New Orleans, but the story is so light. The ""quirky"" characters are barely memorable and the whole crime subplot is irrelevant at best. Read Jim Grimsley's Dream Boy instead, a much better novel about young gay life"
1,no good,ok i bought this light for my gameboy and guess what i got more light from the passing lamp posts than this thing i mean i couln't see squat throguh the light all i got was really glare and so little light that i coulnt ever see it DONT BUY spend of a worth wile light. yes i know my grammer and punuation and spelling suck learn to live with it. o yeah did i mention the look of this thing is cool if your about 6 years old
2,Misses the Mark,"The Crumbs first s/t album is in my opinion one of the best Rock n' Roll flavoured Punk albums ever. The ideas they were going for, and the songwriting on this album are great...the problem is the production is horrible. The songs could have sounded great, but they are buried in guitars that are way too loud, and a horrible drum sound. This is especially dissapointing considering the s/t album has some of the best production I have heard in the genre. The song style on this CD is like a mix between the s/t album and some 70's Stones. A little more soul added to their sound. If you LOVE the first CD this might be worth picking up. Definately don't buy it as your first Crumbs CD though."
2,bought for a friend,"he thought they were cheap looking. We haven't taken them out of the box, they are good for a collector"
2,Don't read this if you want to feel happy.,"This book is read is really depressing, but if you like that feeling, please feel free to read it. It is sometimes scary, and has no suspence."
4,Alone in the dark for adults only,"I thoght this game was pretty good.It keeps you guessing and has the blood and gore to make you worry about the creators. There are even a few places that make you jump a little. SAVE YOUR AMMO whenever possible. Tword the end, after the manor, you will need it. The book is not essential if you are in mensa, so I recommend you get it. The only thing Bad to say about it is that once you get the book, you can solve it in about 12 hours. That is if you choose Carnaby as your charachter. I have not tried it as aline yet but will probably do so soon,"
5,ALONE IN THE DARK (BEST ONE EVER MADE),"This is the very best (ALONE IN THE DARK) game that has ever been made up to 2011. Seriously, there are 2 different characters, Great graffics, haunting music, cool story line, good puzzles to solve, and 2 disc long to keep you playing for awhile. I love this game better than any other alone in the dark that i have in my personal collection. And i have every single one ever made. Please get this one if you like survival horror games. Also try the DREAMCAST version of this game too. They are both AWESOME!"
1,"Pretty, but buggy.","Although I rather like the game and really enjoy the graphics and music of it, I now wish I hadn't purchased it at all. The game is rather buggy. It has a tendency to crash when you attempt to skip dialogue, and sometimes key items simply do not work. One of the online faqs I read explained in detail that sometimes an item simply won't work as it is supposed to, and in such a case, you basically have to start all over. Restarting your PSX/PS2 won't fix the problem. I had that happen 3 hours into the game with the library keys. What a waste of time. Good game; lousy quality control."
3,"It was OK, but not as good as the other reviews say it is!","In a sense, the game does have good lighting and use of the shadowing, but it just didn't scare me that much. Maybe, that is because I have been through the horror in other games such as Resident Evil, Dino Crisis, and other games in the survival-horror genre and already have experienced that. I find though that the monsters in some parts were not that frightening like the shadow monsters in the attic area. Althogh there was a somewhat frightening effect added with the monster in the water towards the beginning of the game. There wasn't that much to offer, though. I recommend the games from the Resident Evil series over this and the Dino Crisis series. They have a scarier vibe. I don't recommend playing the Silent Hill series because it is just crap with cheap monster and overly dramatic effects, which detract from any horror of the game."
2,library code,"playing this games is very best and enjoy but i have problem to find the code at library ,"
3,Slightly disappointed,"This book was useful and somewhat helpful in providing additional information on reformatting my resume. However I probably would have chosen another book had I been able to compare. This book is 199 pages of which well less than half is actually narrated tips on creating a resume. The remainder of the book consists of resume and cover letter examples. In actuality this book should be considered a book of examples rather then instructional. In, addition, the examples are repetitive and often provide the same information over and over. Really in the approximately 75 pages of examples there are only about a dozen unique items to learn from. There are also pages dedicated to listing institutional references which seem to serve almost as a page filler.The book does do a good job of diversifying its audience to a wide level of financial professionals however; in general, it seems somehow inadequate."
3,Very disappointed with Sony!,"Bought this computer 2 weeks ago from Best Buy directly. Although the computer is pretty easy to use in most cases, we found there was no user guide or any warranty information that came with it. Talked to the store manager & he claimed Sony does not give much information of their products any more. What?? So, I called Sony to inquire about this but got no satisfaction. Looks like the support is lacking too! The main purpose why we picked the more expensive Sony over all rest is because we have had great luck with 3 different Sony products in the past. Well, no more! This may be the last Sony I will ever buy!"
4,Winds binging storms,"After reading this ant the preceeding two books of the Winds triligy, I am looking foward to the coninuation of the story of Valdemar and the impending threat form the East. All of Lackey's books have the fight between good and evil as their focus but it is her development of the environment that makes the whole thing great reading."
4,pretty good,"In my opinion, Winds of Fury was the best in the trilogy. This is a well written fantasy novel, rated high in the books that i have read, although not the best. Mercedes Lackey did well in her development of the characters and plot. I particularly liked the development of An'desha. With the long overdue end of Falconsbane she skillfully brought in a new character who easily wins the heart of readers. Her use of figurative language in metaphors and similes works well to describe places and events, and her work contains proverbs that tell truths. Although I liked the book and found it believable and well developed, some of the dialogue she uses is a bit awkward. It does not happen often but enough to be noticable. Overall, her message of good triumphing over evil once again works well in her plot, along with the light romantic interludes that give the novel a sentimental quality."
1,NOT A GOOD SELLER,SELLER DID NOT SEND THE ITEM WHEN I ORDERED IT. I HAD IT EXPEDITED 2-3 DAYS AND NOTHING WAS SENT TO ME. THE SELLER ALSO DID NOT RESPOND BACK WHEN I TRIED CALLING AND WRITING AN EMAIL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
3,"Pretty, but SMALL!","If you're like me, you have a hard time gauging the size of something just by looking at the dimensions in the item description. I got this jewelry case in a box mixed with other products, and at first I thought it was overlooked and not included! Then Lo! and behold! There is was... boy! I was pretty disappointed--it's waaaaay too small for the price. Don't get me wrong, the product itself is pretty and nicely made, it's just LITTLE! Unfortunately, I had to pay for the return shipping ($5) but that was a small price to pay compared to being stuck with a $70 item that doesn't hold very much. On a side note, the individual stacking trays I got from the same company are awesome."
2,Disappointed.,"I had hoped to use this for the parliamentary procedure section of a public speaking class at a junior college. It was simply not worth the price. The content is too basic, and there is no actual processing of motions."
1,One of the worst yet !!!,"I'll keep it short and simple: this is as poor a recording of this venerable work as I have ever heard! John Wallace might be an adequate trumpet player technically, but his musicianship suffers incredible lapses. His (own) cadenzas are all ego and quite ugly, his intonation frequently slips, his articulation is sloppy, and the liberties he takes with the score are trite. He's in the same category as Rolf Smedvig. Skip this recording and instead get Hakan Hardenberger's beautifully played and artfully realized version instead."
4,Good at baroque,"There is no doubt that wallace is a fantastic trumpet player! He is especially good at early music. If you have heard other exponents play the Haydn trumpet concerto and thought it was great, then you ain't heard nothing until you've heard Wallace's rendering. For me Haydn can get a bit boring from tiome to time, but Wallace really brightens it up with some amazing virtuoso playing. I really recommend this CD. But, having said that, give Wallace anything other than a baroque trumpet and you will notice that his sound is just awful! I have never heard a so-called expert rasp so much. He murders the sound of the cornet like you wouldn't believe. Technically very good, though, so if you buy Wallace, buy Baroque and you can't go wrong."
5,Amazingly Under-Discovered...so far,"There are no words to effectively describe this CD or Andy Mullen. The more you listen, the more you WANT to listen. If you are a ""lyric-person"" buy this CD. If you like to bounce around to catchy simply consructed music, look no further.I've read a ton of comparisons about Mr. Mullen and none sat right with me. I DO hear some of his influences, but his originality overshadows all of them. I have not been this much of a ""fan"" since Rickie Lee Jones.If this is missing from your music collection, your collection ain't complete."
3,"humorous themes, lyrics, and stories","I'm not really a fan of folk music, but Mullen's humorous themes, lyrics, and stories are a refreshing change from the same-old-same-old tales of love and ocean voyages."
5,"Wonderful DVD...Soothing, Relaxing, Beautiful Scenery..","I bought this dvd because I was getting tired of listening to rock, alternative,reggae, hip hop and whatever else there might be. I was thinking it would be good to start listening to it at work..since alot of people don't mind soothing music. Well I popped in and started watching and listening...It is amazing. The sights, the music I was so pleased with the dvd that I bought another one for my home. It has been a way for me to relax my nerves and forget about the everyday stresses in life. I pop this on and boom! My way of thinking shifts and I begin to feel good.I highly recommend this..."
2,Lacks Thoroughness and Full of Typos,"When I first started learning Romanian on my own, I thought this book was very useful, and I'd still say it is if you just want to memorize a bunch of phrases without learning why they're constructed the way they are or how to contruct original sentences. But after taking two years of college Romanian, I'm horrified by this book's lack of grammar explanation (Romanian grammar is quite complex and requires clear explanations for English speakers). The book helps you memorize common sentences, but in fails to prepare you to speak Romanian outside of a script. Also, there are so many typos I want to scream. Typos in the English text, in the Romanian text, in the dialogues, even in the exercise answer keys. I can't recommend it."
3,Not for the non-immersed student of Romanian,"I read some of the other reviews here and decided to give this package a try. The bundled CDs were very appealing and it looked like just what I was looking for. Unfortunately, this book can't stand alone in teaching what it sets out to do.With the included audio, this book is great for the beginning phase...learning the alphabet, simple phrases, and various words from the language. This audio remains helpful throughout the book, but this is not enough. As the chapters progress, the reader is expected to have great leaps forward with their grammar. The book just doesn't include enough material for the expected progress."
2,So - So,This teaching method is not very user friendly - it focuses on vocabulary and verb tenses rather than conversation. I much prefer the Pimsleur method.
5,great live album,This is a great album. Like all of heather Myles albums. If you have a love of music this album will not disapoint you.
4,very objective review,"Just got my photo frame. here's a quick and HONEST review.PRO: PRICE, EASY TO USE (PLUG AND PLAY), NICE STYLISH FRAMECON: PICTURE QUALITY (more on this below), frame shuts down when i move it around. at first it was annoying but once i had it on my desk, i didn't need to move it and it wasn't that big of a deal.now regarding the picture quality, when i first plugged it in, i thought it was pretty bad. I never owned a digital photo frame and didn't come close to my LCD monitor. But i kept looking at it, and it wasn't all that bad. matter of fact, i'd now recommend it to my friends because for the price, it's definately worth it! so save yourself couple hundred $s and spend it on buying a nice new camera."
4,Good for the price,"This has a lot of options and is great as a gift. I bought two for the holidays and they are going to great use. You can change the photos periodically and there are different modes to view. Good for the price but sometimes the resolution can be grainy. However, considering the price, it's still a deal."
2,Photoblitz Picture Frame,"Difficult to use. Tried to return it, but their customer service department was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE and UNCOOPERATIVE. I will never, ever, purchase another product from this company."
1,crap,This thing said it will work with vista but it doesnt. Matsunichi should STOP production and recall all of these worthless things and destroy them.
2,Does not work with Windows 7,Does not work with Windows 7. Online support is basically non existent. Don't waste you money on this if you use Windows 7. It's not worth it.
4,nice photo frame,"I actually purchased this over a year ago, but hadn't given it a review. The frame is nicer looking then most, a richer look to it. The picture is good, sound is good. Took awhile to figure out how to load the music."
4,Good For the Money,"The resolution is nothing to write home about, but unless you want to spend at least 3x as much money, you won't notice much difference between this and any of the other digital picture frames under $200 or so. About my only ""complaint"" concerning this unit is that there is no provision to run it on batteries, rechargable or otherwise. That is pretty common with these units though, unfortunately. I found a great SD memory card for this on Amazon for less than $20. All things concerned, this is a really good deal, and I am very satisfied with the purchase. Stupidly simple to operate. Would make a great gift."
3,Technology just never slows down...,"Two or three years ago, this would have been an amazing product. Now it is just fine for a stocking stuffer. If you can get a good price, it can make a nice gift.The low resolution produces a somewhat grainy picture. But you can use low resolution jpg's and fit a ton on a small memory card that has outlived its usefulness for your camera in this world of $20 2GB cards.It is very easy to setup and use. Stick in a memory card and turn it on. This is good since the instruction manual is written in somewhat broken English, despite the California address for the manufacturer."
3,This frame was okay....,"At this time, it's really hard to find a good digital photo frame that doesn't cost as much as a decent 17"" LCD monitor. I gave this frame to my mom for Christmas and the picture quality isn't the best...but it's decent if you're not picky. You can tell the pictures are a bit pixelated and the colors definitely aren't the same as the originals. Maybe if you stand a couple feet away you won't be able to tell. Bottom line is that if you don't want to spend $150+ for one of these things and aren't too particular about picture quality, this one will do. At least the frame is nice."
3,"Poor picture, cute idea.","This is a cute idea for a busy mom who wants to carry all her kids photos. The screen is just too small to display any photos with more than one person in them. Pictures with two or more people come out very pixelated and hard to see. But, what do you expect for under $20?"
3,Cheap and workable.,Good for the price. Pretty hard to get the memory card out without using a tool. Grandma was really happy!
2,Disappointed- no memory card,"This product is a disappointment. It does not have any internal memory.. fine, but what I was not told was that I needed to purchase a separate memory disc for it. I would have purchased it at the same time, or at least, I would have known.I am debating whether or not to return it.Oh, and the mini-disc adapters that pop up as a recommendation.. You do NOT need them; at least, not for this item.YOU DO NEED A MEMORY CARD!-Disgusted"
2,Piece of junk,"The usb is the only way to power it. The battery runs out within two days and needs constant recharging. The software doesn't always want to work and needs to be manually recognized repeatedly. Service from the company purchased from is slow to non-existent. This Matsunichi photo viewer has low resolution and is a total piece of junk. I will keep it and use it as a prop, but it serves no functional purpose."
4,good for this price,"The q-ty of pictures rezolution is good,specialy i did like that slide show changing it self in different stiles.The only think i did not like is that you can't control the functions"
3,digital frame,"Frame is very plain, some pictures on the card are turned the right way but show up the wrong way and when you try to turn them on the frame, they turn but it doesn't save the turn--it just goes back the next time around the wrong way again. Control buttons are hard to figure out--somewhat confusing."
1,Not a good choice,I purchased this item as a gift for my parents. My father is a gifted photographer and very savy with digital products. He tried several different photo memory cards and everything he could think of and got horrid banding and color problems. They returned this product. No fun!Matsunichi PF-809 8-inch 16:9 Digital Picture Frame with Remote Control
1,Aweful resolution,"The screen is so tiny that NObody can view the aweful, grainy pictures without getting a headache."
1,Not for your parents!,"I ordered this item thinking it would make a great Christmas gift for my mom (78) and my father-in-law (93). The screen was indeed a nice size, but I decided that the controls were too small and difficult to see to make a good gift for Mom and Dad. If I had difficulty seeing them and operating them at 50, how would they manage it. I ended up returning the items and I must say that WorldWide was very accommodating about the return, although I did end up paying shipping both ways!"
2,Only 480 x 234 resolution,"Based on the review stating that the person reduced his pictures to ""800x800"" and gave 5 stars, I thought for sure this was an 800x600 (or similar) picture frame with a good display. Unfortunately, it's really only a mediocre 480x234 display. I'm returning it. I should have known better based on the price (notice how the higher resolution frames cost more) but I hoped for the best. I also should have done an internet search to get the specs. It would be nice if Amazon listed this very important spec. Oh well, at least Amazon has a very good return policy."
2,Inexpensive but shows,I bought two of these for Christmas gifts.Both were scratched around the frame.The menu system is horrible.NO remote!Spend a little more and get a better product.
5,Nice digital Picture frame at a good price.,"This is a good digital picture frame, and it is working great. It is well priced compared to similar picture frames."
2,Not so great,Bought for Christmas gift. Bad quality photos. Program does not work with newer Windows. Ended up buying better ones from another store.
4,"Overall, a great frame","I only have two real complaints about this frame. The first one is that there was some trouble getting the SD card in the right way so it would read the pictures. I am used to the typical spring loaded computer and camera slots, so this one was a little tricky. Once it was in though, everything went great.The second complaint is that some pictures are a little pixelated, and under some settings, parts of pictures are not displayed. It's really not a problem, especially considering the price.I bought this as gifts for family members. I preloaded photos on 2GB cards before wrapping them. They worked perfectly, and was a great gift,"
4,digital frame,"This is a really great frame, but a bit difficult to program. I would recommend this frame, but not for the computer beginner."
4,Good Deal! Decent Frame,Got this for $50 through Amazon and was concerned about the quality based on other reviews. Granted - it's not as high resolution as I was hoping but it looks good. I wouldn't put a picture of a large group of people in here but it serves its purpose. Don't buy a $50 digital frame and expect it to work like a $300 frame. It's not junk at all. I was happy.
4,Good Fit,"I bought the picture frame for my non-technological saavy mother and she figured it out quickly. The instructions are clear and easy to follow. It was the cheapest model I could find in it's size at the time, I am sure you can find cheaper now. When our first memory card filled during Christmas we put it in the frame and the older parts of the family thoroughly enjoyed seeing pictures of the family during the day. TigerDirect was very fast with the shipping (1 1/2 days with standard shipping) and I would recommend buying from them if you are in the midwest."
2,Matsunichi Photoblitz 7-inch Frame,"This frame was fair for the price. I received a Pandigital frame as a gift which was MUCH nicer for only $40 more. The Pandigital plays music, has better options for the slideshow and is more user friendly. But for a cheaper product, the Matsunichi is fine."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I've been waiting for the price of the digital photo frames to drop a bit. This was the first one I've seen that I would consider cheap enough for the gamble of buying without seeing it first. I was not disapointed. Just like a TV or computer screen, if you are too close to it, the picture looks grainy. Arms length or further is perfect for viewing. Pictures are clear in a bright office environment or a darker living room in the evening.In the four hours I watched the unit before boxing it up and shipping to my mom for mothers day it mis-read two pictures. That's acceptable for the price."
3,You get what you pay for,"Although cute and practical, I would say this photo key chain is like a lot of the other ones out there. The images are very pixelated and grainy. If you crop your images from high resolution to just a portrait or specific detail in the picture then it'll probably be alright. But for the size and price, it's still a fun little gadget. Don't buy it for those tech-savvy people because they'll be just as disappointed as I was. Program installed easily as well and it was quick to add pictures into the key chain."
5,Fine Product,"Super easy to download my pictures to my own memory card, then insert the card into the frame and turn it on. This was a gift for my mother, and she loves it. Picture quality is fine.As of mid-Jan. 2008, I've bought three of these for family members. All working super, no problems."
1,Broken within 10 minutes,"I bought this is a gift for family with a plan to load up an SD card with photos. I inserted the SD card and watched a slide show for around 10 minutes before the screen went blank. I have been unable to turn on the frame since then. Now we'll see how the return process goes. Once again I am forced to learn the valuable lesson, ""You get what you pay for."""
2,poor quality,You get what you pay for. The picture quality is not very good and the menu system is terrible. Just changing the default screen is an ordeal.
5,nice for the price,Bought this for a gift for my wife after reading previous comments. All the pieces were there - except for the storage chip but I knew that.Loaded it up with photos of her horse and surprised her for her birthday -the wife not the horse. Set it to be a clock with picture mode and gave it to her to take to work.My wife loves it.
4,7-inch photoblitz,"Overall, not a bad product. The first one amazon sent me had a faulty film on the screen which wouldn't come off so they took it back and sent another at no charge. They even reimbursed for the return shipping! but that's not the point. Point is, it's a solid frame. Resolution is okay, pictures look decent, menu is easy enough to navigate, price was great. Unless you're a hardcore photophile, you should definitely grab this--but be sure to buy directly from amazon for free shipping and great return policy, just in case."
3,Picture is a bit out of focus,The picture is okay. If you dont look at it straight on then the pic looks out of focus. It is easy to use though. The price was good.
3,Click!,"I like the looks, but it's a little tough to set up and to send to someone to run a little cumbersome. I don't like the fact that I have been unable to take out the ""set up slide show"". Other than that, great for the price I paid."
3,Not too bad for the price,"This product was purchased as a gift for two relatives. They arent big into technical items so they wouldnt know if it was high quality or not but would be amazed at the process of it all. I think the looks of it was well worth the cost, the images were midiocre (but I have seen worse quality for more money!). I would suggest this to anyone. The only thing I wish were different was that it was battery operated or rechargable as it has to be plugged in. The cord/plug can be a bit unsightly unless you can set it up somewhere that its hidden."
3,Decent product for the price,"First the bad news: No memory chip is provided. I failed to notice this when I purchased the item, so I was out another $20 for a 2G memory chip. Also, the photos are displayed somewhat cropped, especially vertical ones. No software is provided to show you how the picture will be displayed and help you adjust the image. I've seen this software included in much cheaper brands of digital picture diplay products. However, for the price this is a nice digital picture frame and overall I'm happy with it."
4,Excelente compra por el precio,"Ayer recibi el producto, la calidad en terminos generales es buena, fácil de manejar, la resolucion de la imagen no es la mejor, pero considerando el precio esta super bien.Recomiendo este producto y el proveedor.Puede ser un excelente regalo para cualquiera."
3,Bottom cut off pics,"I bought this frame knowing that I was paying a lower price and would get lower quality. For the most part, my pictures come across fine. There is a little pixelation, especially with photos take on an older 4MP camera, but it's not bad for the price. My biggest complaint is that the bottom of the photos is cut off. Many of my photos now look like I centered the frame then moved the camera up an inch before taking the shot! Like another reviewer, I think this is fine for a constant slideshow on your desk at work (which is where mine sits), but if you want good quality presentation, spend the extra money for a better product."
4,Good picture quality,"The picture quality from this frame is better than those of another frame I purchased for almost twice the price from a major retailer. The controls are not as intuitive and there is no music playback, but for a digital frame does that really matter? I never plan on using these for sound anyway. Overall a very satisfied customer."
1,Broken out of the Box,"After trying several different memory cards, formatted every way possible, using the cameras, a windows computer and a Mac, still could NOT get it to recognize there was a card. Kept getting a message ""insert memory card for use."" Only online tech support is available. This was a big disappointment, because it was a Christmas gift for my wife. Purchased a Coby Digital Picture frame for three dollars more and it works great. Had to spend $10.81 out of pocket to return the Matsunichi and have not heard from them since. So as it now stands, twenty days after Christmas, they have my screen and I am out $111.00. Not a happy customer"
3,digital frame,"The instructions were not as clear as they could have been and I did not understand that there was no internal memory. I happened to have the some memory chips that worked in it. Once I loaded the pictures on my memory I already had, and figured out the way to make it go to slide show, I liked the product and was happy with the purchase. The resolution could be better, but you can still see the pictures and my mother will enjoy seeing pictures of all of her grandchildren."
5,Harp? You must be kidding!,"Hi, Victoria's cousin here again. I reviewed ""Harp Dreams"" and am back to tell you how much I enjoyed ""Harp Favorites."" As I said in my other review harp has always seemed a little upscale for my tastes; i.e. Willie, Roy Orbison, etc. But having listened first to ""Harp Dreams"" and now to ""Harp Favorites"" I'm here to tell you that this is the most beautiful music that I have ever heard. The selections are fantastic and the heart and soul that goes into the playing is out of this world. If you ever feel that you need a little peace in your life, then get this CD -- it will open up new worlds to you."
5,Popeye poster,"The quality is good. I wish it had been offered in a larger size, but I put it in a larger frame and it looks ok."
3,Not very good,"I bought this at a local store. The good thing is it comes with a clay bar case to put the clay bar in. The actual clay bar isn't very good. I used it on my hood and it would not pick everything up. I kept on hearing the scratching noise. I rubbed the same area for 20 minutes. I went to my uncle's house and he had the Mother's clay bar. His clay bar had been used on 3 cars, mine would be the 4th. It took almost everything off. The Mothers clay bar is softer so I think it worked better. My clay bar was never used, but it still didn't pick everything up.History about my car, it is a 2004 Infiniti G35 Coupe. I felt the paint after washing it and it felt like the car had never been clayed. So Mothers worked the best for me. I did clay the rest of the hood with Mothers and it was very smooth. I will need to clay it again to get as much of the dirt build up as I can.I would recommend the Mothers Clay Bar over this from my personal experience."
3,"Surface Difference is Amazing/ Looks, Not So Much So","I was expecting at least the looks/shine/gloss to look 30% better or more. Unfortunately I literally can't see any difference (and I'm a detailed oriented guy). I took before and after pics, showed them to others and they don't see it either. I will say the surface texture is worlds better after claying. It's like going from sand paper to glass smoothness! So there's that."
4,"Works good, but one bar seems a little small","Purchased this for a detailing project on my vehicle. Was the first time I have ever used a clay bar. Seems to work very well for removing contaminants from the paint surface, but seems like one bar is almostly too small. Only opened one bar, maybe better with both, but one did the job."
5,The Best,"I think meguiars is the best product for the price on the market today, you cant go wrong with all of the items they sell just read the directions first."
3,Good Value,"This clay bar kit offers a lot of value compared to competitors. It comes with a microfiber cloth, a small bottle of cleaner wax, clay lube, two 55g clay bars, and a black container to contain the bars.The clay is easily bendable and does a good job for picking up contaminants such as tree sap, tar, and rail dust. If you are trying to clean up overspray or anything major I would suggest buying a more aggressive clay bar. The reason why I gave this 3 out of 5 stars is because the price on Amazon is $5.00 more than what local stores are offering."
5,Really Good Product,"Clay Bar,,,Paint!!, This product is amazing, it will make your paint surface smooth as a baby's you know what."
5,Great Car Products that Really Work,"I'm now a great fan of Meguiar's car products. All of the ones I've used do exactly what they say they will, and what more could you ask. A bit pricey, but after you see what they'll do to the surface of your car, compared to the other products out there, you'll see that it's well worth the few cents extra.As for this particular product, if you're all into the ""wax on, wax off"" sort of thing, this is the arm exercises for you. The clay does wonders for the car's finish (my truck looked like it was rusting, and now it looks showroom fresh) and the wax is easy and simple to use with no extra effort required. For a great looking car finish, this is the real deal."
4,works,this product did smooth out my hood pretty well. Not quite the results I expected but it was still a big improvement. Very easy to use/apply etc.
2,clay? kit,"The key word in a ""clay kit"" is kit. There is a cleaner, some polish and a buff cloth, but almost NO clay. However, the product does work well."
5,Better than expected!,"I used this on our 2009 Nissan Maxima which I just picked up a few weeks ago. It was the first time claying a car and I couldn't have been more impressed with the results. After claying it, the surface felt as smooth as glass, removing all imperfections that were previously there. You can easily see and feel the product working as the white clay bar turns almost brownish after removing the nasty contaminants that were previously there. Just fold it over and and use a clean spot after moving onto the next area. I then used the provided cleaner wax to clean things up and protect the finish until I apply some better wax next month. The surface as it is now though, is probably the smoothest feeling I've ever felt on ANY car I've owned. Now that the surface has been thoroughly cleaned through this process, I plan on using Meguiars NXT 2.0 Tech wax to keep the finish in stellar condition."
4,"Worked well, hard to apply.","Worked well for me, hard to apply - after work is done get ready to spend even more time cleaning your car from CLAY. But overall - it worked, can't complain. Removed contaminants very good and price is fair.(See my other reviews of Meguiar's products.)Recommended."
5,Worked great for what I needed,"I'm not a professional and I haven't spent a lot of time detailing my car, but I did some research and wanted to get the best feel and look for my car and tried this product. I've heard everyone talk about the clay and I really don't know the difference, but that may be simply that I am new to detailing my car. Anyway, it took the contaminants off my car and make it as smooth as glass. I can tell from using it that it was smoothing out the surface of the car in seconds! And it was fun! I took the time and did my car in less than an hour and it's look great ever since."
4,Works as advertised!,"I bought this a few weeks ago, for around $16 AT THE WORLDS LARGEST RETAILER (Sorry I'm not plugging them)...and I tried it last night. And all I have to say is it really, really works! I was a little hesitant about whether how well it works, but it thought 'what the hey' tried it and was very impressed! My neighbor even commented on the difference. My car '07 Honda Accord (black), and the shine was impressive. My only gripe is that, from prior review reads, I believe this is a PRE-WAXING detailing product. The product doesn't talk about this as a PRE-WAX detailing system, but....oh well. I'm sure you don't need to wax afterwords, but I'm going to. As of now I will continue to use this product, or maybe try the ""ICE"" clay product (NON-McGuires) to compare. But, like a lot of the others here have said here, most like it. If you like your car and like to see it shine, Try this, it works! You won't waste your $$$."
1,Useless.,"Suction cups too small. I just won't stick to windshield. That is, after all, the only thing they are supposed to do."
4,Great holder,This item works well with my EZ-Pass. I really hated the velcro and pulling it off to bring the tag into another car and now viola I never need to do it again. My only complaint is that after a year of use a part of the plastic cracked but they are so cheap I had to buy a few more as backups.
4,good buy,"Very easy to use and makes it a breeze to move the ez-pass between cars. While this is not discreet, it's a worthwhile purchase especially if you need to share your pass and don't want to have the tape residue on your windshield."
5,Great EZ-Pass Holder,This makes moving my EZ-Pass from the windshield to the glove box a snap. Plus it can also allow me to move the EZ-Pass from car to car.
2,Stick with the Velcro,"I purchased this a few months back, and was pretty happy when it came in. I really didn't want to stick Velcro on my windshield, ya know? It worked great, until it didn't...After about 3 months, the suction cups were shot. They were so flattened, I threw the thing out. It just kept falling off because of the wonderful roads here in PA, so I would have to re-stick it up.I'm buying the Velcro, and that will be that."
4,Works as advertised,"This is a great alternative to the ""velcro"" adhesive supplied with an EZ Psss. Certainly makes transfering from vehicle to vehicle easier."
1,Don't Bother with this item,First hot day the item suction cups do not stay on the windshield. Completely useless. They want 20 words so I will just say don't waist your money on this item.
4,OK,It was received on time and it works as advertised. I would recommend it for EZ-Pass holders. I don't know if it will fit other rf ID tags such as Florida's Sunpass.
2,Weakness,"Started out well, worked exceptional until one day I was going around a right hand corner only have the tag come shooting at me. This was only a few weeks after purchase. I put it back in the holder but it became a regular thing in falling out on right hand corners. This tag never had to leave the holder so it would have have gotten weak from useage. I had use some two sided tape to he it in the now."
5,Cheap and easy solution for rentals,Cheap and easy solution for rentals without getting in trouble with the rental company if the scanner does not pickup the signal when hand holding the unit agains the windshield.
1,How can they sleep at night?,"Bill Kristol and his ilk need to be banished from all access to pens, pencils, word processors, etc. He is beyond repugnant.He is all that is vile and contemptible in man..."
1,Old-fashioned prejudiced dressed up with appeals to science,"This book purports to be a scientific examination of homosexuality, but unfortunately, it approaches the subject in a decidedly non-scientific manner. It starts with a conclusion (""homosexuality is harmful"") and then searches high and low for evidence supporting its position.Unfortunately, the scientific evidence for their conclusion is lacking. The authors gather up a motley collection of various doctors and pundits who represent a ""who's who"" of the anti-homosexual political movement in the United States. Their ""compassionate"" arguments against the dignity of homosexuals is a chilling display of bigotry dressed in modern social scientific discourse."
5,"Weather dancing, singing, or killing, these women look good.","Kiss me monster starts out fast. There are two sexy nightclub-singing detectives. They seduce and kill. Sometimes they just cripple. Jess Franco directed. He's made some strange and very sleasy films over a long career: Sadisterotica (with the same cast), Faceless, The Awful Dr. Orloff, The Diabolical Dr. Z, Night of the Blood Monster, And other films under false names. There is a mystery to be solved and lots of fast paced dialogue. It's confusing from the start, super stylish, and the girls are smart and sexy. The first time I saw it I was very confused, the second time I got it. It's like a European Russ Meyer movie without the pnumatic aspect."
2,ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS----NOT,"Jess Franco teamed up with Adrian Hoven, of MARK OF THE DEVIL fame, though this is a lame movie, that seems to have been written in a couple days, maybe when some last minute money became available---which is how some of Franco's movies were made.No gore, a few seconds of nudity, lame action, no sets, all cheap location filming; not much going on for a 1969 spy movie. The plot is totally unimportant, as is a Frankenstein type monster (with no makeup) that is part of the generic action.There is a disco scene with a horn section version of YOU REALLY GOT ME, and the location filming in Fascist Spain are nice. The title music sounds like it was lifted from a German Edgar Wallace movie, maybe THE CREATURE WITH THE BLUE HAND.In a weird way, this movie, with two women for the heros, does come across as a less funny episode of ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!"
5,A Great B Flick,"I recently became a big fan of Jess (Jesus) Franco. This has to be his funniest movie. I have to admit though, I not sure what was meant to funny and what wasn't. The cheap production, the bad dubbing, and the over the top story, make this one very enjoyable movie. If Mike and the bots ever do another MST3K film, this is the movie they should be forced to watch. I would highly recommend this to any fan of B movies."
2,"Inferior sequal to ""Two Undercover Angels""","I truly wish I could have rated this one higher, because after all, it's Jess Franco, one of my favorite directors. However, I must call a spade a spade: this film, a sequal to ""Two Undercover Angels"" (see my review), never truly sparks. A viewing of ""Angels"" is essential before digging into this one, and even then ""Kiss Me Monster"" so full of campy in-jokes that one quickly gets exasperated. Here, our two beloved ""Red Lips"" chicks travel to the tropics for an ""adventure"" (I use the term loosely). I caught myself glancing at the DVD timer to see how much time was left--and it's a short flick! As a Franco completist, I own it, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it to the public at large."
2,"""Eurotrash"" on the spine of the case sums this one up.","A couple of buxom babes traipse around the Carribean, tracking down a mad scientist. One of director Jess Franco's least successful efforts. For die-hard Francophiles only."
5,Great learning tool for the weekend golfer,"As a person who loves to play golf but cannot get out to play but once or twice a month, this book provides great instruction to help me monitor my own game."
5,"Well written, easy to understand, and sure to help your game",This is the BEST golf instruction book on the market. The photographs are fantastic and the reading is simple and to the point. Mr. Dunigan has conquered the game in writing. Well worth the time to read it.
4,Deeyar is a plagiarist,"I haven't actually heard this album, but I was curious to see what people thought. I thought Deeyar's review was fairly well-written, until I checked out Allmusic and noticed he or she cut-and-pasted the review directly from their site. That's hack. Don't pass off other people's reviews as your own."
3,"good rappin, weak beats","Obviously the raps and lyrics are great but the beats seemed weak. Comparing them to what else was going on in 1992 they seem out dated and behind the times. But, this is worth the price just for the MC."
2,There's only ONE good track in this album!,"Track #1 (Whats on your mind) is probably the best track on this album. It would be the track that would be loved by even today. The rest is played out. There is no single for Track #1. But it's also on the House Party 2 Soundtrack. The soundtrack is an average soundtrack. I think the price is worth buying. So since there is no single for just that one song, I'd rather buy it on the House Party 2 Soundtrack."
1,"nice diagrams, bad information","I recently used this book in an undergraduate genetics course that was taught by a M.D./Genetics Counselor who, after the first month or so of using the book and the accompaning powerpoint presentation got so frustrated that told us not to bother reading the book anymore. An example would be the improper use of the Chi Square test that the book uses and instructs.If you are an instructor save yourself the trouble of dealing with a book with so many errors in it."
4,Interesting mix!,"I bought this album because of the song ""Go back to Piaui"" by Juca Chaves. I was surprised to see the quality of the recording is very good and the other songs in the cd are also good. This is a very interesting album that added value to my collection."
3,"For the price, a decent camera","The Mercury CyberPix S-555V - Digital camera - compact - 5.0 Mpix is a good buy for the money. Just understand what you're getting. It's $30. It uses SD cards. It also uses batteries (AAA). And it's slow on the shutter action. And the flash isn't automatic, and when you need it and turn it on it takes 10 seconds to charge the separate flash battery, and then another ten seconds to recharge after using the flash. But for $30, it takes decent pictures as long as you adjust the settings for the type of light present. Plus it fits in your shirt pocket. And you don't worry about it being stolen in poor security areas."
3,Creaative.,"This production was very creative, but it might not be welcomed by the traditionalists. At first it was hard to watch because of my own concepts on what an opera should be like. Once I could go beyond my small mindedness and open my heart to the creative idea and focus on the music it was good. I realize I should explain this better. The puppets were the characters on stage and the singers except for Colas who sang with the puppets, sang behind the orchestra. It was interesting how Bastien und Bastienne was inserted within Der Schauspieldirector. It seemed to work. The singers were very good, especially on the coloratura runs."
1,"Too much water, not much Yosemite!",Misleading description. There's not much of Yosemite here at all unless you count the shots of rushing water that takes up 95% of this video. It could be any river any where as there is scarce coverage of any trail or surrounding environs. A big dissappointment.
4,Orcs!,"Another hard-to-find module from the ""lean years,"" this one throws the PCs into one of the most classic scenarios of all time... assault the Orc lair, rescue the prisoners, destroy it, plunder it, and get out alive! Seems pretty simple, in a fun hack-n-slash kind of way. But once your heroes (levels 2-8) come to the dread Orcish city of Krimba-Hai, and the fell secrets that lie within, they'll never trust you again... :) A vicious, ingenious twist on every predictable gaming hook ever devised... highly recommended!"
2,Not quite what I expected.,"The first problem I encountered with this came right after I took it out of the box.Both connectors were covered by labels, which left a bunch of sticky residue when I tried to pull them off. I spent about an hour just trying to get them clean enough to use.Second problem came when I popped in the ""software"" disc. It turned out to be nothing more than a readme file linking me to drivers that didn't even work. I spent another 20-30 minutes searching the net for drivers that worked.The cable itself worked fine after I managed to clean the connectors off, find the appropriate drivers, and download Windows Media Player. Be aware, if you have a Chocolate with V5 firmware, you won't be able to use programs like BitPim with this cable."
2,Danger Will Robinson,"This cable did not work. It fits the unit and computer, but I was unable to make the connection using the cable and software. My computer did not recognize it. I ended up buying the Verizon product for V-cast Music after all. Very disappointing."
2,Good as a charger,The software was not included in my cord. Thanks alot. Makes good as a USB charger which I don't recommend using as such. Much like a car charger in voltage which I have noticed has effected my battery life.Thanks
2,not sure,i bought this product about a month or two ago. and i still haven't been able to figure out how to use it. i had other phones in the past and used a data cable to download ringtones and were easy products to use. THis product seems to be a lot harder unless it's the wrong data cable which it shouldn't be since it's advertised as an EnV data cable.
5,Outstanding!,Very good - the video shows how certain signals that are often misinterpreted (as dominance or defiance) are calming signals that dogs use to reduce conflict. Our dog is more responsive now since we watched the video and incorporated Turid's training into our training.
3,dog body language,This is a good DVD to help a person learn about canine body language.Turid certainly has a way of understanding dogs and anyone who spendstime with dogs can benefit by watching her presentation.
3,"Really helpful, but dated","What Turid Rugaas has to say is invaluable for people wanting better understanding between them and their dogs. We misinterpret dogs' calming signals as signs of excitement or other, but this DVD is really helpful to identify and understand our dogs.Where this DVD could use some updating is in the editing, sound, and the addition of a menu or chapters. The DVD is really primitive and the music is awful to the point of distraction and humor. That said, it served its purpose. The DVD is about 45 minutes long, but could really be edited down to 25 if they would have been more succinct in some of the sequences intended to illustrate certain signals. So the price is really high for such a short DVD, but the information is good. Also check out the accompanying book that she wrote. I'd suggest reading it before and reading again after watching the DVD. It helped clarify some points from the book."
3,Pricy,"This video does have some good information in it, but it is sometimes a little hard to understand what she is saying. It appears to be like a home movie but the information and examples are excellent. I do think that it is a little high priced at $17.00. If I had a chance to do it over again I would have just purchased the book."
5,In the 'you don't know what you don't know' vein...,"I recommend this for ANYONE who has a dog. Even if your dog is practically perfect, it will teach you what to look for with other dogs with the calm and quiet signals they are tossing out all the time and we 'stupid' humans miss. We all see the barking, growling, fighting, but miss the 5 minutes prior that the dogs were TRYING to calm the situation down to work things out.Plus there are easy calm things we can do to help the situation or make it worse. BUY THE DVD! Really shows us what to look for with tons of real dogs."
1,Errors,"Either there is a major error on page 256 and 263 or everyone and their brother happens to perceive it incorrectly. The photo and caption are of a John Deere 30 series (2030, 2630, etc.) and it states it is showing a 2010. Two completely different machines! Accuracy and definition are critical in a book like this."
5,Fantastic Beginners' Book,"This book is a geat How-To-Book for beginners. Great projects that can be used; such as a shawl, hats, belts, several purses, decorative and household items. It provides really nice photographic and text instructions for paper samples, small size yarn practice samples in various weave styles and more. Very practical for the beginner and for teaching others."
3,A fine bargain edition,"I would recommend this volume for all casual students and readers of Shelley. It is inexpensively priced, and I believe it contains all the pieces printed in Mary Shelley's 1839 version of her husband's ""complete works,"" along with their corresponding prefaces (rarely provided in more insipid 'best of' collections of Shelley). However, I am unable to award this book a higher rating because it is plagued by some very glaring typographical errors and misprints (example: ""and if the spark with which Heaven lit my spirit/Had been with purer nutriment supplied"" from ""The Triumph of Life"" is presented as ""purer sentiment"" in the Wordsworth edition). Nevertheless, at less than 5 bucks, this book is a great introduction to the unjustly neglected poetic achievement of Shelley, in my opinion the supreme genius of the great triad of the younger Romantics."
3,Small Print makes reading hard,"Personally, I thought the Poetry itself wasn't too bad. Unfortunately the print was way too small, making reading difficult. For that reason, it didn't hold my interest too well. I hope to return to the book again later, once I get my new prescription specs."
5,Christian Rapers With Mad Flava,"This cd is awesome! Its about time that some really great rappers come along in the world of christian rap. these guys have deep lyrics, gangsta beets, and cool voices. If you are interested in christian rap, but DON'T want to listen to music thats 10 years behind in style, than Grits is for you!"
4,good christian hip hop? yeah sukka!,"i have searched a long while for some good christian hip hop, and i must say that i have not been too succesful. untill now, i love this album! grits is what true hip hop is all about! also check out ""erace"" by the gotee brothers another great one"
5,Reminds me of Tulsa......,"""They all fall down"" is the only song I heard by them and so far the only one I like, the song reminds me of Tulsa during the Campmeeting of '99 I had the time of my life there...They all fall down...brings back memories...Very good memories. :)"
4,Very good manual for thesis,It book helped me to write my thesis on the topic Marketing in Banking. It was very good
4,The Ultimate PowerBook,"I agree with the reviewers who said that there are some compromises required to slide this bad boy into a backpack or open it up in Cattle Class while flying. However, I've had mine for over three years, and am about to buy another one (I need a bigger hard drive). I love my 17"" PowerBook and can't imagine switching to anything different. I have seen and tried all the other laptops around the office, and this one is still head and shoulders above other Wintel newer ones.My current 17"" PB also went off my motorbike with me in an accident a few years ago. The front left corner (hard drive!) was severely dented and the aluminum bent out of shape. I put it to sleep, took a pair of Vice Grips and a mallet to it, and pounded it back into shape. Opened the lid and started typing. Several years later, it is still working reliably. In some respects, I'd rather not get a new one, as this one has performed so well!Two (bandaged) thumbs up!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"Great software platform, absolutlely worthless hardware to run it on! Don't make the same mistake I did; purchased a PowerBook Notebook 17"" less than 6 months ago and it has spent a month, on and off total, being ""repaired"" for all kinds of issues. Read the fine print in the extended warranty; this company loves to use refurbished parts to fix their computers. As much as Steve Jobs likes to pontificate on his next operating system( you can watch it in all it's ""glory"" on Quicktime) he has forgotten two important factors: (1) A quality computer to run it on (2) Basic Customer Service 101, "" The customer is always right"". The reality of this is that Apple has become nothing more than an online music store (iTunes) and a maker of a MP3 player to listen to it on (iPod)."
1,I wish I could give it a -5 stars,"I am taking a class in Fiction Writing and this was one of the texts for the class. This book was touted as the be all and end all in assistance in the writing process. I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. I found it used in the bookstore for $40 (remember, starving college student). I got it home and was astounded by what I read in the second paragraph. We were to read chapter 2 first. Well, let me tell you. I have never been so insulted in my entire life. ""...it's probable that your impulse to write has little to do with the desire or the skill to work out a plot."" (p27) EXCUSE ME?!?!?! It only goes down hill from there. This author is arrogant and leads one to believe that she is the only one capable of writing a story. I've attempted to read chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 as they have been assigned in the class. It's complete torture to get through them.I will be selling my copy as soon as I possibly can."
5,Review?,This is not a review - but I have a question. DOESN'T ANYBODY WHO REVIEWS AT AMAZON KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REVIEW AND AN OPINION????? I get utterly frustrated at all of your opinions and I still don't know what's IN the book most of the time. Go read up on how to REVIEW a book before you enter stuff here and waste our time!
3,For academic-literary writers only,"For would-be writers looking for a first book on fiction writing, this book is as good as any, provided and only provided that you are interested in writing what might be termed the academic-literary short story. For those interested in writing for readers (termed by academics the ""popular"" novel), this book could well be highly misleading. The fact that Burroway and others such as Macauley & Lanning think that the same basic principles apply but that ""literary"" fiction goes beyond--this fact shows that they understand neither popular fiction nor yet ""literary"" fiction. In fact, the two are based on diametrically opposed principles and have largely opposite criteria of quality.Also, bear in mind that you are getting only the ABCs in this book. This is a first book, not a last book.That said, the exposition is clear and there are numerous examples (all from academic-literary fiction). Whether it is worth the price--ah, that is another question."
1,Too expensive and too general,"I used this book twice in two different classes, and it simply repeats everything one can find in a $20 creative writing book. The readings selected are lackluster or horribly common in creative writing books already.If this book were even $30, the content would not be so reprehensible. However, with the hefty price tag, the pages should be littered with helpful tips that are new and exclusive to this book. Burroway's ""Imaginative Writing"" is just as boring and hollow, but it at least does not gouge the pocket.I would reccomend not buying this book if one is looking for a creative writing book. Instead, check out ""The First Five Pages"" or ""30 most common mistakes of Fiction Writers,"" both of which rest comfortably under the $20 marker. For those who are required to use this book for a class, either don't buy it or purchase an earlier edition."
3,The great Nero seems to be going through the paces a little,"TEXAS ADIOS comes with a good pedigree: DJANGO-era Franco Nero, director Ferdinando Baldi of VIVA DJANGO and BLINDMAN. Despite this, the film turns out a little leaden and melodramatic with long gaps between bursts of action. Nero, playing a sheriff, leaves his Texas town to cross into Mexico to find the man who killed his father years ago. Nero's kid brother tags along for the sole purpose of being the subject of a soap-opera-style plot twist late in the film. The disc, by Anchor Bay, looks great; and the original Italian audio is available, always a plus. However, the proceedings, despite being nicely shot, are a little wanting and lifeless. The great Nero seems to be going through the paces a little. A better option from Nero's catalog is MASSACRE TIME; Baldi was much better with the aforementioned VIVA DJANGO. Check one of those out instead."
2,Yawnsville,"Meh, this movie is not one of the better Spaghetti Westerns I've seen. Its like a mixture of a bad American Western and a Mexican Soap Opera. Boo.But, as usual, Anchor Bay has done a great job with the presentation, so theres yer two stars. Clean print, widescreen, nice extras. You definitely cant fault Anchor Bay's treatment, it's just that in my opinion, the product aint so great in this case.Avoid unless you're a Spaghetti Western completist."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping for some more Django-esk fun, but it is not here. The character playing Franco's brother was goofy! The action was pretty good but sadly not enough was here. The DVD quality is good."
3,Texas Adios,"HiThis movie is OK, but not great quality. It does attempt to do something but lacks the real grit."
2,Short versions of classic rags,"Virginia Eskin is a good pianist and her playing of Joe Lamb's classic rags is quite enjoyable.However, those of you who appreciate classic rags played with repeats of strains, be aware! Eskin (or the producer?) cuts out at least one of the strain-repeats on most of the rags. As I see it, this does not add any value to the anyway short pieces of captivating music of Joe Lamb. There are only two rags out of twenty on this CD that are presented as full versions (Alaskan Rag and The Old Home Rag). Why?"
2,American Sorta-Beauties,"Ms. Eskin certainly can play piano. She can certainly read music. And she can combine the two well enough. What I found most distracting about this album, however, isn't the fact that she doesn't repeat many of the measures. It's that she tends occasionally to hit clinkers. After the first one or two, I found myself listening more closely for mistakes than actually enjoying the music. Another problem with this album is that her renditions are too bulky and heavy. I've heard much cleaner-sounding performances of Lamb's work.I paid the money so I don't intend to return the CD. But it'll play well enough in my noisy car driving to and from work."
1,Cheap price,"Please check in the same listing, the same DVD is priced very cheaper i.e. $ 8, this one here is close to $30, so ensure before you click the buy button."
5,Beautiful,It is exactley what the title says. I will be buying this book for gifts for all my friends from now on.
5,Great Journal Prompts,"When I was a teacher this was an invaluable resource. Every morning I would pick a new quote to have my students write about in their journals. This is also just a great book full of thought-provoking quotes. I am buying a copy for a friend of mine for x-mas. She is not a teacher, but an avid journaler. I think this would make a great gift for anyone who enjoys journaling, not just educators."
5,This is my favorite of Eric Muhler's albums.,"OK, I might not be an expert on jazz, but I know what I like, and I love ""Live at the Jazz School."" The first number, ""1990-for Jane"" is wistful and charms me into craving more. The energetic ""Sand Castles"" is destined to be a classic. And joyous ""Zoe"" makes me want to dance."" From beginning to end, this is jazz at its best!"
1,"Whatever this is, it is not Montreal's The Dears...","What language are they singing in anyways? Sounds like a Korean or Japanese pop band - it is not French, nor is it The Dears of Montreal."
1,BUY NO CITIES LEFT!!!,"FIRSTLY, Buy No Cities LeftThen Orchestral Pop Noir RomantiqueThen End of a Hollywood Bedtime StoryThen, if you feel like it, this piece of poo.It sounds like they did this with a four track recorder in a garage and the songs blow.I've seen them live, they are not like this crap at all, they are AMAZING!!!there is even liner notes that says this really isn't even the dears as we know them today....."
1,"""Foil-Enhanced"" - uh, not at all","The certificate was listed as ""Southworth Foil-Enhanced Certificates, 8.5 x 11 Inches, Green Border, 25 per Pack (CT3R),"" but these were not foil enhanced at all! They were just plain-printed certificates. I would've sent it back for a refund and exchange, but I didn't have time and had to settle with these. I could've printed something like this on my own. Please make your description accurate. Also, each of the pages had a little green smudge on it - BOTH packs. Very disappointed."
1,Did not last!,"Seemed to have very well for 8 months and suddenly the clutch fan burned and caused the compressor to lock up. So I am in process of replacing it with a new one. Could have been simply a bad unit. I thought of returning it to the seller but they stated that I would get parital payment for returning it, then I had to pay shipping for returning it and shipping for them sending me a replacements so the costs calculated to be about 60% of the cost. I threw in the towel and bought one locally."
5,This Classic Should Be Re-released!,Picnic is one of the all time great movies. A stellar cast and multi-story plot offer great acting and pure entertainment. The music theme is unforgettable. What a relief from the drivel coming out these days. PLEASE re-release it.
2,Picnic,"Old fashioned, too out of style to watch, boring as heck. Didn't even finish watching it, waste of time. Good 25 years ago."
5,Much better than Far From Heaven or Mona Lisa Smile,"Excellent 1955 classic starring William Holden and Kim Novak that accurately portrays the way things were in America circa 1955. The Technicolor cinematography is absolutely splendid, even more than Far From Heaven's (there is TOO MUCH color, a problem that didn't plague Technicolor movies). And that's not the only thing that makes this movie better: it shows how things REALLY were in the 1950s because it was MADE in the 1950s. There is no liberal vendetta or pro-homosexual propaganda. And that Moonglow dance...AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
4,"Girl from the golden west, etc.","My wife liked The Girl From The Golden West better than I did. We both are in our 80s, and enjoy old movies , and do not waste our time on the stuff being put out today."
4,Picnic,"Glad to have it on DVD, sometimes when you fast forward the talking is out of sinc and you must hit the button again. Have always liked this movie, so am dealing with the problem. If you like Kim Novak and William Holden, you will like this. I like to watch it from my portable DVD player, put you right into the movie."
5,Queen Madge of Neewollah....,Excellent 1950's 'Scope film by the usually weak director Joshua Logan filmed on location in Kansas. From the opening train whistle to the quilted farmscape ending this one is really well done....not as stagey as some of the director's other films....well worth it for Novak and Holden....beautifully framed by the great James Wong Howe.... Twilight Time did a fantastic job on this blu-ray....the nighttime scenes are exceptional....especially under the otherworldly Moonglow of the Japanese lanterns....
5,Great movie,Made in the 50's. Acting a tad hokey by some. William Holden never looked better. Same for Kim Novak. Love the picnic scene when they danced on the dock. Worth the watch. Music beyond great.
