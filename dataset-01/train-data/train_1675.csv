1,What happened to such a great group?,"Chris Thile is the best mandolin player in the world, and Sean and Sara Watkins are certainly also world-class on guitar and fiddle. Their first album was incredible, so I've been looking forward to the group's second album ever since the first was released. I also own all of Chris' albums, and Sean's solo album, so I had an expectation for what this album would be like. What a dissapointment! Other than the first song, an instrumental, the album is almost un-listenable. I forced myself to listen a second and third time, but that's probably it for me. The second song in particular is very bizarre - it reminds me of the Beatles' (who I despise) psychedlic period. I hope they return to their bluegrass roots and continue creating wonderful and unique music. They have SO much talent, it is truly a shame to see it being wasted on an album like this."
2,Big miss on this one,"Nickel Creek missed it big time on this one. Smoothie Song had me cranking up the stereo, but Spit on a Stranger had me nearly turning it off. Things dont get much better from there until the 9th song which is a traditional tune that Nickel Creek does best. The next four tunes are more of what I expect from this group, Chris finally lets Sara sing something. My advice to this group is to stay away from the progressive stuff and stick to traditional and bluegrass. Definitely not the quality of the last album. This is one of those albums that is good for three or four songs only"
2,Sophmore Slump,"I really tried to like this CD, I did . . .Nickel Creek first impressed me when I saw them on a Grand Ole Opry special on TV, I bought the first self-titled CD, thinking they were an instrumental group. Boy was I wrong. Where the first album has strong songwriting with some of the most beautiful harmonies I've ever heard, the new album ""This Side"" lacks. Now it'd be foolish to think Nickel Creek would make a carbon copy of the previous CD to try to keep the momentum of that gold selling disc, they seem to have taken from all the less desirable parts of the album, and recreated it here on ""This Side"". The disc does have it's standouts though, with Green and Gray, This Side, and Seven Wonders recapturing some of that classic Nickel Creek sound, mostly, this disc falls flat. Still, if you enjoy this CD even a little bit, go see the Creek live. They're awesome on stage."
4,"Different, But Good","If you have enjoyed Nickel Creek's first album, with ""This Way"", you are in for something a little different. Their first album consisted of several instrumental pieces and a few vocal offerings. ""This Way"" has only one instrumental piece, and strays a bit from the traditional bluegrass feel of their first album. I feel that this album is more about the lyrics and less about the actual music. They fail to showcase their talent as good as they did on their debut album. All in all though, ""This Way"" makes a good purchase - whether you are a long time Nickel Creek fan or are new to their music!"
3,Contemplative melodies,I've enjoyed this album quite a bit. Can 'experimental' be translated as 'unsure how to end a song?' There are 3 tracks have awkward endings - is that a production error or a deliberate action? Not sure - but it detracts from an otherwise very lovely cd.
2,Where's the bluegrass?,"They are so talented. So incredible to see ""live"". I was sad that they chose not to do bluegrass pickin' and hope Nickel Creek will consider doing more in the future."
5,Straight up Talent!! Who cares if it's not hardcore B-grass,"Nickel Creek is a group that is very young and talented. They have so many years ahead of them, who knows what they'll be coming out with 3 years from now. People change in life and music. I get so tired of people ripping on albums because the artist isn't playing the fiddle enough. I heard the same complaint about Alison Krauss's Forget About, and now we have to hear it about Nickel Creek. HELLO. The voice is an instrument as well!!!"
4,Don't Hold Back,I have been waiting for a long time for this one. I have listened to it over and over. I like the cd but it really doesn't showcase Nickel Creek's energy. There are way too many slow songs on this CD. I do like them but I think they are at there best when they are playing all out. Allison Krauss produced this CD and I am a huge fan of hers also. I love New Favorite. I saw the special on CMT about Nickel Creek and Allison said she really had to tone them down on the new album. I think she over did it a little bit. I would buy this CD again. I think that it isn't quite in line with what I think of when I think of Nickel Creek. IT does have it's magical moments. Smoothie Song is worth the cost of the CD.
4,A mixed bag,"I hesitated between 3 and 4 stars on this one; my husband says ""Too early to tell"" because we've only listened to it three times since it arrived earlier today. I went with 4 because I suspect it will grow on me.Nickel Creek is trying to stretch its wings, which I appreciate. Sometimes they soar, sometimes they hit the grass in a way that makes you wince. The Sean Watkins-penned songs are the best on the album, and it's good to hear his voice on the title track (my immediate favorite). Chris Thile gets a little too Glen Phillips-esque on a few songs, and I was bummed to hear the Gen-X-angst whine tinging his normally pleasant tenor. (I'm 21 so hopefully I can say that without sounding like a fuddy-duddy.)All in all, I'll give it a few more complete run-throughs before I resign myself to hitting ""skip"" on a few tracts. Hopefully their next album will be more cohesive."
1,This Side CD,"I had to run right out and get Nickel Creek's new release -- This Side. I absolutely loved their first release -- self-titled, Nickel Creek (5-star rating), so I was really looking forward to buying their second release. I spent quite a bit of time listening to the CD last evening and for the most part was disappointed. The songs lacked the substance found on their first CD. I found the only radio-friendly tune to be the title track, which is featured on CMT as a ""hot shot"" video currently. It was spunky and upbeat. This is the ONLY song I truly enjoyed on the entire CD.I had difficulty trying to speculate what Nickel Creek's next single might be. There just didn't seem to be many songs that stood out. I thought most songs were down -- not upbeat...just the opposite of their first release.I think the members of Nickel Creek are extremely talented. I've seen them in concert and they were outstanding! However, for whatever reason, this CD missed the mark."
2,Weak Creek.......,"Nickel Creek blew my socks off seeing them live after thier first album, but this seems to have taken a step backwards. The songs seem cheesy, and the whole thing reminds me of trying to be cool in High School. I wish I could say I liked it because I have a lot of respect for them (they are all virtuosos). I saw them again recently and they were still great but everybody seemed way more into the songs from thier first and solo albums too. I hope they aren't getting sucked into the gaudy, gloss-pop vortex of doom."
2,Too much Chris,"I loved the balance in the first album but Chris's song writing and gratingly high pitched voice on the majority of this album was hugely disappointing to me. No real duets with Sara, only one instrumental track...basically a solo Chris album. He drowns out the great background instrumentals which are the key to Nickel Creek's success! And, frankly, I prefer Sara's soft voice (ala Alison) to his as she subtly accentuates the music. Anyway, I haven't listened much, but I can guarantee you there will be many tracks I'll skip (Green and Gray is awful)every time I listen."
2,What CD have they been listening to.....,"Let me say first of all, I loved the CD that came before this one. It is a fixture in the disc changer in my car. As soon as I recieved my copy of This Side in the mail, I put it in the player. Never have I been so dissappointed. I have skimmed most of the other reviews on this sight...and frankly I don't know what CD they have been listening to. I wish I had read the CDNow review before I bought it. The characterization that the CD lacks the creative maturity equal to the performance talent of this band could not be more accurate. I have come to the conclusion that Nickel Creek needs a new grass producer who can bring some direction to the music that is beyond adolescent experimentation. While not entirely a disaster, for the most part, this CD qualifies as an experiment that should not have seen the light of day. My copy went straight to the second hand CD store."
2,Uninspired Musical Direction,"Nickel Creek is an exciting and fresh band that can carve its own path and attract listeners from a number of different genres of music. Unfortunately, ""This Side"" seems as though they, along with the help of Alison Krauss, are trying too hard to package a new sound. The music on this album underutilizes the energy of this group. With the exception of a few cuts, it seems to drag. It is a shame because this group could do so much more. The CD seems to be following too closely the direction Alison herself has been heading. Unfortunately, her latest CD is also not very inspired. She seems to think that the ""whispery"" vocals are providing a new direction to bluegrass or whatever genre it is. Too bad that the energy is lost. In my opinion, Nickel Creek and Alison Krauss need to reassess how their natural musical energy can be shown rather than inhibited."
5,This Side,"On their second album, Nickel Creek have shown signs of growth, and experiment with their sound more. The sound is very different from their debut. There are some interesting cover songs, including a cover of Pavement's ""Spit on a Stranger,"", Carrie Newcomer's ""Should've Known Better"" and the traditional ""House Carpenter"". They make these songs their own and give them an interesting twist in sound. The original compositions by the band such as ""Speak"" and ""Beauty and the Mess,"" are highlights as well. Who cares if the music here is less bluegrass and lends itself to other genres? At the end of the day, all that matters is that it's good music throughout."
2,Not so good...,"I bought this album because i loved their self titled debut. Unfortunately, it really is nothing like their first album. There is only a hint of bluegrass sound, Chris Thile's vocals are straying into an alt-pop sound, and frankly, many of the lyrics are painfully insipid. Too bad, their first album was (and still is) one of my favorites. If you liked Nickel Creek (the album) for it's unique sound, don't buy this one."
1,Major Disappointment,"After a delightful debut album spotlighting their great instrumental talents, this group has gone for more vocal cuts on this album; their voices are fine and blend beautifully, but as soloists they are thready and weak, self-conscious and even timid. It seems they have attempted to reach a larger audience by going more ""pop"" than folk/bluegrass. They should have stuck with what works, because this doesn't AT ALL."
1,i was hoping for so much more...,"Nickel Creek's debut CD is one of my favorites and I was so excited to hear their new CD. I was extremely disappointed. ""This Side"" is NOTHING like the debut CD. The style is completely different and the music just doesn't pull on my emotions like the first CD did. As much as I hate to say it, if you enjoyed their first CD, you probably aren't going to like this one. Sorry."
2,Their first album was MUCH better.,"Nickel Creek's debut album of the same name was pretty good so when ""This Side"" came out I had hopes it would be a good follow up. I was wrong, if you expect this album to be anything like the modern Bluegrass of the first album don't bother coming here. I liked many of the songs on the first CD but it seems like all of the selections here are much more Pop flavored, little or no tradition to them (the video I saw on TV was too weird to believe). Any of the group members can do much better than the work they display here, Sean Watkins is a good instrumentalist and Sara Watkins can really sing, but they left that behind on this one. Maybe a third album, if there is one, will be better."
1,Going on a journey,"I too liked their freshman effort and was sorely disappointed in their sophmore effort. They seem to have veered off the path they had started on, exploring a road full of synchopated techno-pop and try-to-hard chord structures. I, for one, don't wish to follow them down that road. Perhaps one day they will find their way back to where they started but until that time I will wave a fond farewell and search for other inspirations. I only have myself to blame though, I bought the CD without even listening to any clips on the web. Fool me once, shame on you.I won't be fooled again. Bye bye Nickel Creek. Hope you have a good trip!"
2,This Side,"This is a nice album if you need sleep enducement. I was verydisappointed with the lack of energy. After watching these guyson a TV special, I assumed this to be a high energy group andwas blown away by the indivdual talent displayed by each on theirrespective instruments. I did'nt realize they did so much vocalwork. No chance for their real talent to be displayed on thisCD."
1,They are lost and trying to find their sound,"I was pleased and excited with the first CD ""Nickel Creek"" from this fine, albeit eclectic group. The melodies were distinct and memorable. This CD, however, is without a soul. It seems they are forcing experimentation to define themselves. Unfortunately this experiment fails miserably. If you liked their first CD, you will not like ""This Side"". If you loved ""Nickel Creek"" you will like some cuts here. Save your money, pull your favs from Kaza and wait for their next offering. If their next offering is as wanting as this, we will probably never hear from them again; and that won't be a bad thing."
4,Keep Playing The Music,"I have watched Nickel Creek for sometime now..seen them in concert and they are a great group. The second CD was off the main stream...can't plug it into Blue Grass...Easy Listening...Country..., but who cares? Good music is Good no matter what label you pin on it. I really think this music will be a soundtrack for a movie down the road...I told you so!Buy it...enjoy it...and have a great day!"
5,"Different, but still a great CD","This CD is different than the first, but I like it just as well. I think it is refreshing to see artists do something different instead of making the same music with different song titles. (ex. Kenny Chesney) There is less instrumental only songs. (only one) What the CD has is great harmonies and instrumentation. If you loved the first CD like I did, you will still love this one, too!"
1,This Side - Nickel Creek,"I was excited to see the new CD released, but what a let down. These are three of the most talented musicians to come along in a long time, but what a total misuse of their talent. This was an CD of ballad songs. Nowhere in this CD do we get a chance to see the talent of the three. It's like there trying to prove they can sing. It would have been nice to hear an uptempo song somewhere on the album. I do not know what they were thinking or why Allison Krause would let this leave the studio. If they don't want to play bluegrass fine, but at least don't journey to far from what they are best at. I bought the CD as soon as it came out, listened to it three times and sold it back to the store for something worth hearing. Nickel Creek, you let your fans from the first album down bigtime, and I am a big fan."
3,Deeper than one track...,... but not by much. I enjoyed this cd as well as their debut album but agree that they need some more polish to really break out and appeal to the masses. (if that's what they want) If you're only aware of the title track there are no other songs on this cd as catchy or as well-produced. The title track just holds together better than the rest. Still better than much out there. Reminds me of Toad the Wet Sprocket or The Kennedys.
2,like bluegrass? buy the 1st one,"Unfortunately, I'll have to give this one a ""thumbs-down.""I was really looking forward to hearing the new CD, but...well, Nickel Creek's first CD is Soooo much better than this one; if you're looking for something other than bluegrass, this may be for you. I did enjoy three of the songs on the CD but was really put off by the second track; try explaining to a five-year-old bluegrass fan(my son)why the song seems to say it's alright to ""spit on a stranger!"" Nickel Creek has so much talent, but unless you own their first CD, you'd never know it."
4,A Good Accidental Find,"I bought this CD without a cover at a Pawn Shop thinking it was a 2002 Train CD (their crown symbols are similar)- when I put it in, I realized right away that it was not - but I wasn't disappointed. This is a very well crafted set of songs that are soothing and acoustically woven. I like this better than what I thought I was buying. I see reviews below where people didn't like this because it wasn't Bluegrass - thank God, I would have died.This is a group of true musicians and if they take a turn, I'll say what I always say - let the band be true to themselves and find or experiment with their sound.While definitley not Bluegrass on this set, there are some GREAT tunes here. There is plenty of Bluegrass and Country out there - this is something different, more folk inspired and I like it a lot. The beauty of Amazon is that you can listen before you buy - so give it a chance! :-)"
4,It's foreign on this side.......,"Everybody else has said this too, but this album is different than the first. However, it isn't as drastically as you might think on a first listen. The funky newgrass element is still there as is the stellar musical talent and killer harmony. They even have Edgar Meyer on bass for a couple of tracks! There's also some nice new stuff that comes from their experimenting. Obviously they have been touring with glen phillips (from toad...) and that effected their style. The biggest disappointment to me were the self absorbed and often limited scope of the lyrics on several of the songs (thus the 4 stars only). But, that shouldn't keep you from buying this incredible CD."
2,This isn't Bluegrass.,"I'm not saying it's not great music. If anything it's great music. There's a mix, even an emphasis on folk and British Isle style of music and poetry, a little too sad and a little too serious. Oddly, it's also a little too pop. These folks (kids?) are obviously super-talented both with their song writing and their ability to operate their instruments. However, their music appears to be searching for direction, or maybe just THINKS it's searching for direction. Overly dramatic, overly self-conscious, overly-non-bluegrass. It's not even newgrass, but more like Neo-Folk-Pop. Yeah, it's great music, but it's not what I was shopping for and not what I was expecting. If I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have bought this album. This isn't bluegrass."
3,Weak Sequel,"The first effort was phenomenal. Maybe I was expecting too much this time. Its not bad, its just not nearly as strong as the first release. Hopefully it will grow on me over time. The talent is still obviously there, the songs just arent as strong."
4,a new and different side,"As the artists of Nickle Creek grow and change, so does their music. This follow-up album to their self titled debut has many wonderful moments. Sean Watkins title track is by far my favorite, and the most reminiscent of the first collection. The rest of the album is an interesting mix of many different genres of music. I listened to the whole album three times in one day to get a feel for Nickle Creek's new, but equally addictive, sounds. A must have for any fan of the group, but don't expect that same bluegrass core as they branch out in the musical world."
5,Update!,"Hey, I'm the person who wrote the second review for the album, and I am changing my rating! After listening to this CD as much as I have, I am ADDICTED! This album is awesomely cool, extremely original, and I love all the songs on it. Therefore, I am upgrading my previous rating of 4 stars to 5 stars. Awesome work."
5,Have You ever Heard of Nickel Creek?,"Unless you are very lucky you probally never heard of Nickel Creek. This was a small group(no longer together) that played and recorded some great music. They even appeared on Austin City Limits on PBS once. If you do know about this group you probaly own this CD- if not, you should treat yoursrlf to some great music."
5,New Horizons,"Don't expect just another bluegrass album, even if you thought you had imagined Nickel Creek's style with their first self titled CD this very different. It's an album of three young talented muscicians who are curious enough to try out almost everything that comes to their mind. It's really an album that needs to be listened carefully, because some tunes don't please for the first time. But if you are looking for something besides the mainstream developments: that's it. I am eager to see how these folks have developed in five years time."
3,I was dissappointed...at first,"I wrote a review of this CD over a year ago and I admit I was dissappointed at first listen. While there are some tracks I still don't like, this album really grew on me. I still don't think it's quite as tight a collection as their debut CD but it's as good as it can get. Most of my dislike for some tracks boils down to my own personal preferences. If you liked the first CD, it certainly isn't a waste of money to get this one as well."
1,Nickel Creek Where Art Thou?,"Like a lot of you I started my latest round of summer purchases with the new Nickel Creek CD and I wish I hadn't. The cartoonish cover sums up the album perfectly. It's an eclectic, akward mess that clunks and limps along with no unifying threads and none of the barely contained energy or breezy, lightning fast instrumentals which characterized their brilliant debut effort. Instead they chose to concentrate on their vocals which was in my view, a major mistake, Thile and Sean Watkins share the vocal chores on the majority of the 13 tracks, but it is Sarah's vocals on ""Seven Wonders"" and ""Sabra Girl"" that provide the only highlights on an otherwise very disappointing sophmore effort. I hope this band which once showed so much promise can regain its stride after this misstep."
2,Waste of time!,"The words stink!!! (I don't know what the producer was thinking)The music is o.k., but nothing compared to their first CD."
1,This Side,"This CD is a total letdown after Nickel Creek's first release. It has a few interesting notes but the ""bubblegum"" nature of most of the songs will keep me from playing it. I have decided not to see them perform live again. I wish that I could get my money back."
2,A sequel that disappointed me.,"I loved Nickel creek's ""Nickel Creek"". In fact I would give it 4 maybe even 5 stars. Maybe my expectations, of this sequel, were too high. I will give my impressions of ""This Side"" as a comparison to ""Nickel Creek"". ""This Side's"" recording quality was, by comparison, on the dark and somewhat thick side.as opposed to the former's up front ""alive"" sound. Gone was the stunning instrumental vertuoso fireworks of the former replaced with lack-luster ""poppish"" lyrical wanderings.The former was 85% Bluegrass with a smattering of progressive pop/new age sound which melded into a pleasing new style of blugrass which I liked.The latter was in compairson about 15% bluegrass, and the balance was the bland uneventful lyrical wanderings mentioned above. After listening I could not recall a single tune to hum or whistle, that's too bad.""Nickel Creek"" was a hard act to follow, but they are young and very very talented, I'm sure they will do it again."
1,Don't waste your money.......,What a letdown..........no energy....nothing worth listening too......save your money......
2,Creativity?,"I am reading a lot of reviewers saying they are creative, which is driving me crazy. How many covers are on this album? What is really pissing me off is that their Pavement cover sucks. Pavement is so much better and then Nickel Creek comes is having trouble making their own material for their next album so they steal songs from people that are better than them. Nickel Creek does get some credit, however, for having some good taste in music. They obviously like Radiohead (The Greatest?) and probably Pavement (THE Greatest)too because they did that cover."
1,Pretentious Newgrass Experimentation,"Someone told me this was a great bluegrass band and I should run out and buy this CD. I have never regretted a CD purchase more. If there were standards for defining bluegrass, this would defy them--and I don't mean that as a compliment. The main vocals are utterly devoid of talent, much less vibrato--sounds like whoever sang the ""Friends"" theme song. It's all very plucky, full of pointless stops and starts.Yes, these young musicians clearly know their craft--perhaps too well, because instead of listenable tunes, the entire album pushes the limits of tempo and style for what seems to be annoying experimentation for it's own sake. If you like the rich, rhythmic sounds of AK+US or other traditional, foot-tapping bluegrass, avoid this album like the plague. If you like uppity prodigies experimenting for kicks, then buy this."
2,Disappointing Blu-Ray transfer,"Since this was the DVD and Blu-Ray debut of KOTSW, I was expecting a decent transfer if not an outright restoration. We got neither. The video on the Blu-Ray shows a softness akin to VHS or laser disc and there are numerous artifacts that appear throughout the film. If someone went through all the trouble of releasing a deluxe edition they should have at least made it more presentable."
5,When is this movie going to be on DVD already???????,"My VHS tape is wearing out. I really liked this movie, good story good acting. It's a one sided love story. William is gay and in prision, Raul is a political prisoner and they share a cell. The corrupt warden makes a deal with William, if he can get Raul to reveal some vital information they can use against him, William will get his sentence commuted. But, in spite of their obvious differences, the men become closer , William realizes he is in love with Raul and refuses to tell the warden what Raul might have revealed to him. Enjoy!"
1,very disappointing transfer quality,"I am delighted to finally have this movie in my movie collection again. I have sorely missed this title since I got rid of my laserdiscs. But I am shocked by the quality of the transfer. I consider my standards low - I have been thrilled with the quality of some titles that have been poorly reviewed by those with higher standards, like reviewers at dvdfile and highdefdigest. But I was truly shocked by this title. I am sure that my laser looked better. And this is a blu-ray! Still, I am thrilled to at least have the film, and the documentary included is outstanding. I do hope that this title receives the attention of professional reviewers. Consumers need to be warned by voices they trust."
5,THE WAIT IS OVER!,"FINALLY RELEASED !!!!!!!!!! THE BLU-RAY SHOULD BE SPECTACULAR, CAN'T WAIT. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE EXCLUSIVE:)"
5,It!,"TV had screened this movie just once years ago-and it is really a masterpiece accomplishing both context and performance.Producing DVD is ""better later than never"". Enjoy!"
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,I watched this movie will it came out years ago and putting it on blu-ray might make the transfer nice but the movie still sucks. You'd be btter off sleeping then watching this movie.
5,"Kiss of the Spider Woman, Great for Human Interest and Entertainment","Magnificent acting, Splendid direction, Great conclusion. If only you could offer it in Region 4 (Viewable in Mexico), I'd order it in a split second. Please, please, do your best to get it in Region 4 format.Thank you."
1,Non-anamorphic low quality DVD-R transfer.,"Save your money and buy the retail boxed / glass mastered version of this movie. I purchased this version not realizing that it's the burn-on-demand version. The transfer quality and bitrate are much lower than what you'd expect from a regular DVD, and the image quality shows it."
2,Can't get this to work in my DVD player,"I ordered the DVD version, sent first one back. Received second DVD still will not load. Says DVD on disc so I am sure it is not blu ray. Sending second one back. Was really looking forward to watching this old fave, even had a few friends over for an evening of viewing. What a disappointment. Did load up another oldie and served up the popcorn."
1,Disc is completely blank,"I ordered Kiss of the Spider Woman on July 27, 2012. I opened it and it looked good, no damage. I finally got a free evening and decided to watch it. The disc has NOTHING on it. Incredible! Now when I look into returning it they claim I'll only get partial money returned. It's my fault for not checking it immediately. I'll know for future purchases to do this. Who charges someone and sends them a blank disc? That's terrible. I hope your laughter and my hard earned money is worth the scam. Congratualtions, you're a horrible person!"
5,Kiss of the Spider Woman,"A ""knock-out"" film with a great cast. The late Raul Julia was outstanding and William Hurt was equally great. Took a long time for this film to be available on disc, but worth the wait."
5,WHERE IS THE DVD??????,"I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS 17.... OVER 20 YEARS AGO ""I LOVED IT!"", Would like to buy it on DVD...or i'll settle for VHS? the acting was great Hurt and Raul were terrific"
4,Movie Factory 6 plus is very good,"I used this to create a compilation of 20 or so short movie clips. This program allowed me to create the menu, although I wish that I had a little more creativity with it but I can't complain about that. The DVD came out beautifully and reccommend this program for basic movie making. I may feel that more advanced editing can occur as I get more experience with it."
1,A TOTAL RIPOFF BY COREL,"If you buy this product you had better hope it works for what you want it to do. There is NO SUPPORT if you have a problem. I wanted to do what I thought was a very simple thing. I wanted to take 2 DVDs and combine then into 1 and then burn that 1 DVD. It could not be done. I thought that was such a simple thing that I wanted to do that there was a problem with the software so I went to Corel's web page to ask for help.Their reply was ""You need to pay for support to find an answer to you problem"".NO MORE COREL PRODUCTS WILL EVER BE ON MY COMPUTER. I leared my lesson. I hope other profit from my experience."
2,No Titles,"I am sorry that I bought this software. I am glad I only paid $25.00 for it. Although the software has many great features, it lacks the ability to create titles or end credits. I have had to resort to creating title scenes in Microsoft Windows Maker, save them as video clips and then import them into Moviefactory 6. I have even spent several hours on the internet trying to find a fix for this shortcoming. The rest of the program is first rate and makes it easy for an amateur to make a good looking movie. Until I find an inexpensive program that does everything I want and need, my procedure will have to do."
1,Not good for HDD editing,"I purchased this product with the hope that it would work better than Adobe's Premiere, but it doesn't. The only way to get my movies from my HDD camcorder into it is via my PC or a DVD, and it is too heavy and slow, and when I try to use the edit room it freezes."
4,movie maker,Bought item to make a copy of a very important dvd we had made. The product worked well. Would recommend to anyone who wants to make a copy of a dvd.
3,UNIVERSAL STRUT NUT REMOVER,"I bought for my 1998 Dodge Neon struts (front) but when I went to use them noticed that the outer nut tool isn't long enough to reach the nut without some fabrication to upper strut mount housing of the strut (had to remove a small amount of metal along outer edge of hole so tool(socket) can reach nut)and the supplied inner socket tool fit extremely tight (had to hammer it on) so if you are using this tool set for a Dodge Neon front strut be aware you will need to work abit to make it work as if the manufacture had made the outer socket (largest socket)where they tooled it down a bit longer would work perfect but being a bit short easier to remove a bit of the metal from the shock mount rather than the tool (metal lathe needed for tool to remove stock correctly)other than these issues they work fine. Have not used on any other vehicle struts, shocks as of yet."
3,Bitter Aftertaste,"I bought the bulk pack of Raja's Cup as I was looking for a coffee substitute. At first it tastes just like regular coffee, but it does leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste. It is still pretty good and I will probably try it with a little milk or sugar substitute to tame the aftertaste."
5,Mom of 3,"Love this toy, probably the best of the year. It is well made and sturdy. The drill fascinates my 4 year old, and even the 8 yr old and 11 yr old enjoy matching the pattern cards (and they are all girls...). A toy my children will play with for at least 30 mins straight(quite a feat in the video age!!!) If you are considering it, try it...I would bet that you will be impressed."
3,A little tedious for younger child,I purchased this for five year old. The drilling was fun but she hasn't really played with it since. It appeared to be too tedious for her to remove the screws to create another design. She became bored with it very quickly.
1,Impossible to Install Batteries!,"This looks like it would be a great toy. My 3 year old daughter has played with the manual screwdrivers but the power drill is IMPOSSIBLE! I have spent at least an hour, first unscrewing the tiny little screw to open the compartment to install batteries. The batteries are on a spring so you have to use force to close the compartment. I have now worked very hard to tighten the compartment but, because of the spring, you can't get the screw to make contact with the other side. I have tried everything -- duct tape, packing tape, rubber bands, etc. It just won't do it. So, even though this has been fun for the manual tools it was way too expensive considering you can't use the power drill (along with having a 3 year old crying because she can't use the toy). So, big Thumbs down on this toy."
2,Broke after first use,"I bought this toy to work my pre-school special ed students. While one student had a few minutes of fun, the drill stopped working and we have not been able to get it started again. Unfortunately I missed the window to return it.The concept is good, but the drill is worthless. I would not recommend this toy if you are looking for something durable!"
4,Fun and unique,"This toy reminds me of the male, mechanical version of Lite Brites. Our son loves screw drivers and screws and anything he can take apart and put back together. This is a good toy for him since he can operate the drill on his own (with supervision of course) as it fits in his hands and is safe. He is not able to copy a pattern design on his own yet at the age of three, but soon he will enjoy that feature as an added bonus. Right now, we just get creative and make it fun. Good, durable, fun toy. The drill/screwdriver has a good amount of torque over other toy drills we have."
4,excellent toy,THis was purchased for my granddaughter who is 3. She had used it at a pre school program. She loves it as well as her five year old sister and my 30 year old son.
4,Great toy!,"My son who was 3 got this for Christmas last year and loved it! He and his cousins fought over it the entire week. (It might have been nice to have an extra drill!) He enjoys the sound and the mechanical drill.My son will not make the designs on the card, but my 6 year old daughter will. I do usually have to unscrew it when he is finished with it, but it isn't too bad, since it takes him such a long time to screw them all in.I take off one star for ""staying power."" Almost a year later, this toy doesn't get taken out very often, and has lost much of it's appeal. Kids who come over still really want to play with it, but again, there is only one drill. (There are screw drivers and wrenches, but who wants that when there is a power drill?) But boy was it fun for the first few months!"
4,4 year olds went crazy for this!,"Great toy for boys and girls. Gives them lots of opportunity for imaginative play. The drill, however, is VERY difficult to put the batteries in. Had to return one because it was broken. Also, not clearly written on the box that you even need batteries."
5,Drill didn't work but was painlessly returned great toy definily worth it,This came quickly my son loved it but the drill didn't work out the box I retuned it n just days I got the other one n I'm n Kodak so that was definily fast. Fun fun toy!
5,Very engaging toy,"This toy is spectacular, my son loves it. It is also great to have something he likes well enough and plays with long enough that when he is bad I tell him, but if you aren't good, I will take your drill toy and it usually works! It is also good as a single mom to prep him for putting stuff together, now he knows how to work a drill! :-)"
4,And yet another toy for the children,"They have played with this much. Once they do a figure, it doesn't seem to be as much fun taking out the screws. Some times I am the one doing it. They love using the drill and I know they'll be playing with it in the future."
2,Disappointment,"Originally purchased this for my children for Christmas. The drill turned on initially (as soon as we put batteries in), then abruptly stopped working. My son really loves playing with toys like this, so we exchanged for a different one. The second one worked, but the screw on the battery compartment door stripped almost immediately. We really wanted to love this toy, but I ended up returning it. Need to look for something more durable."
5,A 5 year old's DREAM!,"I had bought this toy soley based on reviews I saw on Amazon. I had never seen or heard of it before. I never write reviews for products I've bought on Amazon, and this will likely be my only one! This toy has literally brought HOURS of fun for my son! It is durable, sturdy, and a TON of fun for my 5 year old. He uses the toy drill to ""drill"" in the bits and un-do them as well. There are different kinds of bits to use just like ""daddy's drill"". It also comes with pattern cards to look at and make different pictures from the colored bits. An excellent product and I would recommend this to anyone with a child from 4 - 7 years old....heck...my husband was playing with it...never mind....4-37 years old! :o)"
1,Doesn't work!,"I was very excited to receive this toy. With amazon prime it came a day earlier than expected. Got it home and my son was super excited. Put three different sets of batteries in and I got nothing. The drill does not work. So disappointing, I will be returning this item. It also looked like it might have been used or a return."
1,drill did not work!,The drill doesnt work! Such a disappointment on Christmas morning!Do not buy this toy if you expect that aspect of the toy to work.All the other parts were there.
1,"Great idea, VERY POOR QUALITY","I purchased this toy for a Hannukah 2011 present. When I opened the box the drill did not work. The battery compartment would not stay closed so you could not actually use the drill. Amazon was fantastic and sent me a replacement the very next day (Dec 23, so I was impressed with that being so close to Christmas). This drill did work properly. I was very excited. The 2.5 yr old boy I gave it to was ecstatic. However, after using the drill only supervised and properly for 2 and a half weeks the drill quit working. For no reason, I've tried everything and the drill will not work. I am now returning this product and getting a refund because I am disappointed. And the 2.5 yr old is completely heartbroken. I would not recommend this product."
3,Fun but NOISY!,"My grandson loves the Design & Drill Activity Center, and played with it for hours.The one drawback: it is so incredibly loud that I worry it will damage his hearing. It certainly hurts mine!"
1,"Great concept, but built for a child much older","The pro first: The toy is a lot of fun to play with...The cons:... when it works. I have bought this same product twice. The first time we returned it almost immediately because the screw holding the battery panel stripped the first time I attempted to open it. This could have been my fault, but I open battery panels in all my other kids' toys and this had never happened before. Annoying, but I thought maybe it was just a bad screw.The second time my son received this as a gift from Amazon and we got a battery in and the drill lasted approximately two hours. I have no idea what went wrong, but the drill died. I will NEVER buy any electronic toy off from this brand again."
5,3-year old lvoes it,"I wold not get this for older then 3-31/2 year old but so far he loves it. He does complain about having to take hte screws out but he likes ""being like daddy"" with this drill. It is a cute idea!"
2,High hopes dashed,"This was a gift for my young son. Played with it on Christmas Day (supervised) for about two hours, loving every second screwing and unscrewing the pieces. Next morning, he played with it for 10 minutes before it stopped working. Two issues: 1) out of the box, you had to set it on 'reverse' to screw IN the pieces. HUH? 2)Currently will only unscrew. We are so disappointed and my son is really upset. All in all, an awesome toy (in concept)if it were better quality."
5,Will be a Christmas gift so hoping it will work well.,Was sent in a timely fashion and was what i expected. Looks great can't wait for my grandson to open it for Christmas.
4,good toy,It is good toy. I will recommend. My 2 old son likes this toy. I think this toy helps to make fingers work.
1,defective drill,"I bought this toy for my 2.5yr old boy and he was so excited when he opened it, so we put in the battery and find that the battery door was unable to close as we turn the screw in. But since my boy was anxious to play w/ it, we just tape the door close. He played for like 3 days and got bored w/ it and we put it away...and totally forgot about the door problem. We even forgot about this toy till 2 months later, we took it back out and let him play...it works fine except the battery door sometimes open when tape is loose. Then we thought we deserve a new drill since the door would not close from the start, but because it's been 2 month...amazon would not allow us to exchange or return =( Then I contacted the manufacturer, but they would not do anything about it because we bought it through amazon.I've purchased many things from amazon and never request for any exchange or return and this is only my first time and I'm very disappointed, this is just poor customer service!"
2,Maybe it's defective?,"I purchased this item for my 4 year old nephew's birthday. I tested it out to see how it works. I loved it and knew he would as well. It seemed to be the perfect blend of an educational toy and a ""boy toy"" (the drill is really cool) I was right- he LOVED it! He was able to use it almost entirely independently. It kept his interest for over a half hour. Then, suddenly, the ""reverse"" mode seemed jammed. He kept trying and after about three minutes, the drill started smoking. We haven't let him use it yet, for fear that it could be a very dangerous defect. I suppose we have to return it, but he keeps asking for his ""machine"" back and will surely be disappointed when he realizes he may never get it back. I am especially concerned since I bought two more of the same toy as Christmas gifts for other children in the family. Now I don't know whether to keep or return them! :-("
4,Great customer service,"My kids use this product every day. It's now the main staple of their play workbench and it was so popular with my twins that I had to get the other take and go product with the screwdriver since they were always fighting over who had the drill. i tossed the design sheets since they were just happy to drill and undrill the screws over and over (have AA batteries always on hand). Only drawback is that you need to buy a storage box or Tupperware container to house all the colorful screws that have a way of ending up under your feet at 3am-outch.So six months after use, the red drill stopped working. No reason, never got wet or corroded- just stopped working. I wrote the company and not even 12 hours later they replied saying they're sending a replacement out to me. Didn't expect that at all and very pleased they stand behind their product."
4,can keep them occupied,"This toy can holdtheir attention for quite some time, all you'll need is some ear plugs.I love the way they learn to place the screw directly on top of the board and drill it in. Later on the can make the patterns imitating the pattern boards. It has been nearly three years since I bought it and he still loves it."
4,Interesting.,Great mix of math and hand/eye coordination. As a math teacher I like the idea of not only playing but learning basic math concepts like patterns.
4,A big hit for Christmas,"My three year old nephew loved this. He did not start using the designs, but had a ball being able to change to the various drill bits. Nice that you can either use the drill or hand tool option to both place the screws and remove them."
1,Watered down picture of justice,"I just read this book and got very little out of it. The writing style is full of big words from a professor (NOT a cop, which is one of my pet peeves with this author's work). There are many, many other good books on the justice system and the role of police in that system. I wouldn't waste my money on this one."
4,A Must Read for the future CJS Academic,"I don't out stars gratuitously, 4 out of 5 is very good--a 5 out of 5 may involve the author reading the book to me...This book dicusses the formation of justice studies and its imergence in academia. It challanges the reader to define 'justice' for themselves while providing contextual background for the concept.The author makes the case that justice studies include all the hallmarks of 'social science' fused with 'the humanities'.The changing dynamics of America, a call to recognize the growing role of women in the field and the import of imparting ethics to future practitioners are elaborated upon as well.This book ties together some points, while stressing others, that I find yet to have been made to date in my academic endeavors.As close to a 'must-read' for any future academic.<Includes comprehensive bibliography>"
5,Perfect,"I'm usually staring at my monitor long hours and the strain was beginning to wear on my eyes. This was just what I needed, at a perfect price not to be beat."
5,Fantasia is Fantastic!,"Fantasia has made what should be considered one of the top American Idol releases. From the minute that you listen to ""Ain't Gonna Beg You"" to the stunning ""I Believe"", you can tell Fantasia had the assistance of great producers/performers such as Missy Elliott, Rodney Jerkins, Jazze-Pha, Jermaine Dupri, and others. This is a professionally produced album and compared to previous Idol releases, it seems more fun/enjoyable to listen to, as well as being more credible. This albums gives a real urban feel and it comes over very successfully. There isn't one track that isn't somewhat enjoyable but my top picks are ""Ain't Gonna Beg You"", ""Free Yourself"", ""Baby Mama"", ""Got Me Waitin'"", ""It's All Good"", ""Good Lovin'"", and ""I Believe"". I highly recommend this to anybody, but especially to music lovers who are fans of the urban music scene. You go Fantasia!"
3,Not Impressed,"I got this CD because of all the hype of American Idol and Simon Cowell's own declaration that she was the best contestant that they ever had. Firstly, you have to like her raspy voice, which will either wow you or feel like fingernails scratching a chalkboard. While I must say she is no Patti Labelle she does a close imitation. Where she lacks is the soul that Patti gives her music and that is why I only gave 3 stars."
4,This Album Really Grew On Me,"I wrote the November 23rd review, stating how disappointed I was with this CD. Since then, I have listened to it several times - while cleaning and while at the gym and walking to work. I have to confess that I now LOVE it!!! It really grew on me, and I will definitely be buying anything Fantasia puts out there!"
5,ADDICTED!,"I really cant help but keep listening to this Cd over and over again everyday,good lyrics,heartfelt singing,good beats,this Cd wont disappoint u !"
3,average,After watching pop idol in the uk i thought the first cd would be a cracker but sorry just average.Where has the guts gone?OK the couple of songs she sang on pop idol are ok covers but the rest?If i was simon cowell i would say you aint made it yet and on this performance you won`t.MUST TRY HARDER
3,Fantasia~what happened???,"I loved and voted for Fantasia on AI, but I do not like this CD! I like 'Summertime', 'You were always on my mind' and 'I Believe', but the rest of the CD...well I'll mind my manners here and just say that I just didn't care at all for the rest of the songs. Fantasia, you can do better!!!!"
2,not the real Fantasia,"Unfortunately, this is another example of the Idol folks trying to mimic trends vs. really letting an artist shine. Fantasia is a great vocalist and the overdubbing and layering on this CD hides her uniqueness--makes it a Beyonce ripoff attempt. Too bad--looks like we'll have to wait a release or two before we get the real Fantasia."
1,Terribly Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this album.. She was great on AI, so I was looking forward to this album. I got it early this morning, and from the first track 'Ain't Gonna Beg' I was wanting my money back.This cd is so generic and not at all what I was expecting from Fantasia. Go and pick up any R&B; album, and that is what you get on 'Free Yourself'. Only this cd is worse.And talk about overdoing something. 'Summertime' was good the first SEVENTEEN times she performed it on the show. Now it's on her single, AND her album. Let it go.The only remotely good song on this album is ""Truth Is."" That's why it was chosen as a single. But it sure must have been a hard choice to pick from this album.So unless you are a fan of bland, boring albums, PASS THIS CD UP.Nice try Fantasia, try harder next time though."
1,not my kind of music,"Well, I listen to this cd with a open mind and thought it might surprise me but I really didn't like it at all. I quess if your into R&B music (only) you would like it. I'm 40 year old male and I do have a wide range of music taste, but sorry this horrible Fantasia cd is not one of them. Of course I never been really much into R&B music. Fantasia high note parts also need to be tone down in alot of her songs and please lets try not to remake anymore Willie Nelson songs."
1,Save your Money,"I was a Fantasia fan and picked her to win American Idol way before she did. I am not saying she doesn't have talent, because she CAN sing but this CD is terrible. I played it once and eventually sold it on EBay. I couldn't see listening to this twice. Definitely not my type of music. Save your money!"
1,This chick won American Idol?,"Wow, is this album terrible. Her voice is like fingernails on a blackboard, and I can't figure out why anyone would give this talentless loser a recording contract. Don't waste your money."
1,Thought I would give it a try...,"Love American Idol and the talent the show represents. However, I purchased this cd thinking Fantasia would be as good as she was on the program and boy was I wrong. Doesn't have half the quality of her performances on AI and the songs seem choppy and unfinished or something...I just don't get it. Then, tonight I saw her perform on AI and my opinion of this cd was cemented - she isn't so good after all. Oh well, waste of money, but a lesson learned, I guess."
3,What An Ugly Album Cover,"Fantasia should ask for a new cd cover to beprinted. It's one of the worst I've ever seen.It looks cheap and does not compliment her inany way. Also, the mentality of those peoplebehind her trying to establish her musical identityare way off the mark. There are already too manyr&b;/hip-hop divas with great voices but mediocrematerial. Why go that route with a woman who coulddo better with something more alternative in nature?Give her a big band sound, maybe some number with justvoice and acoustic piano or guitar...something DIFFERENT!Missy, Rockwilder, Rodney Jerkins, and Soulshack/Karlinare already played out producers. She needed Leon Ware,Brenda Russell, or Maurice White to give her some oldschool dressing!"
1,No Fantasia,"Definetley a HUGE dissapointment. Fantasia has so much talent, and she uses it on a ill-hearted album. There was no heart in the making of this album. All of her songs are very plain, express no talent at all, and no form of ""music."" It was a terrible album. Hopefully Fantasia grabs a sense of taste on her sophomore album. The day I got this album I returned it... it was that bad."
3,Fan,"I like this CD. The songs 'Truth Is', 'Summertime' and 'You Were Always On My Mind' are my favorites."
4,""" ARETHA, PATTI, & FANTASIA ""","THE GIRL IS REMARKABLE. OF COURSE YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE GOSPEL SIDE OF HER AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING AWAY ANY TIME SOON BUT SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE. SHE PUT HER HEART AND SOUL INTO EACH SONG. I REMEMBER SEEING HER ON AMERICA'S IDOL AND SHE WAS SUCH A JOY TO WATCH. I'D WOULD CLOSE MY EYES AND JUST LISTEN TO HER SING, THERE'S SUCH A ANNOINTING OVER THIS YOUNGLADY THAT IN THE FUTURE, SHE HAS TO DO A GOSPEL ALBUM. I BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS HIS HANDS ON THIS GIFTED YOUNGLADY I JUST HOPE AND PRAY THAT SHE DOESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE GAME. I'M NOT FINISHED LISTENING TO THE CD YET BUT SO FAR SO GOOD!"
1,I didnt know the chipmunks won American Idol,"Although the music porition of the cd has potential, the singer has a horrible voice. I am surprised not more people have noted that she sounds like a chipmunk. Like past AI winners, this is a sore loser in the end. Bleh!"
2,Not without it's charm.,"I actually gave this recording two stars, yet that is after much thought.What bothers me about this record is that Clive Davis is spending time and effort to produce Ms. Barrino yet his ignores the timeless talents of Miss Diana Ross.While it is fine to help up the ladder new ""talent"", Davis has overlooked that the world is waiting for Miss Ross to re-appear rise again as the great superstar that she is.Barrino gives a fine effort on this CD. My main reason for not rating this higher that a ""2"" is due to the song ""Baby Mama"". This is not a song that should be celebrated. Is it now that un-married mothers to be looked up to? If Barrino hopes to one day reach the status near Miss Ross, she should think twice about recording such material."
1,Annoying screeching cat impersonations,"Fantasia has an okay voice, but she ruins it by screeching. No, it is not artistic, it is plain annoying, and she is just vying for attention. The songs are boring, and plain stupid tunes. The tune of baby mama is so dumb, i think it needs to be educated, the song i mean. I hate hate hate this album. I returned my one five days after i bought it. hahahahahahaha. I hate this style of music."
1,Just bad.,"This is nothing like the Fantasia you saw on American Idol. Here her voice is overprocessed beyond recognition, and the tracks themselves are repetitive and boring. The worst of the lot is ""Baby Mama,"" which has some awful lyrics such as ""B-A-B-Y-M-A-M-A"" (each letter spelled out) ""this goes out to all my baby mamas, this goes out to all my baby mamas"" and ""today it is a badge of honor to be a baby mama."" Other songs are not much better either.Save your money and skip this one."
5,Off the hook!!,Fantasia is the best thang that has hit the R & B scene since Mary J Blige. The album is very awesome. It is something that everybody can list to and she didn't lie when she said that she had a story to tell. Missy Elliot came through for her.
5,I can't believe some people !I'm glad i listened for myself,"I'm am so glad I have my own mind, my own taste, and my own knowlegde of what good music is, because if I didn't... I would have believed all the garbage I've seen written about Fantasia by people who couldn't hold a note...even if it was in the palm of their hands.I am a big fan of Fantasia and I absolutely, whole-heartedly think that america picked the right person as the american idol 3. Fantasia embodies all the qualifications to be a star. She has a profound presence when she's on stage and is exceptionally talented. So if you have come here to slam her.... move on. I think double platinum speaks for itself. I bought the album and loved it....Loved it so much I bought 3. One for home, work and the car. I give her 5 stars but should be more."
4,Nice Debut,"A debut CD can be a hit or a miss. In my opinion Fantasia's CD will be a hit. You are getting the sassiness plus the soulfulness on her CD. You are also getting an array of ballards, hip-hop, R&B with a touch of pop. My personal favorites are Summertime, Selfish, and Good Lovin'. Don't be mislead by the title ""Baby Mama"", the song does pay hommage to the single mothers. Bottom line- add Fantasia to your collection."
5,Had To Review It A Second Time!,"Well, this is the 2nd time I've reviewed this CD. I got it as a Christmas present in December 2004, and only listened to about two songs.Now after close to an entire year, I love this CD more than ever! Fantasia's voice is terrific, and it is really needed in the R&B; world today. My favorite song on the entire CD is ""Ain't Gon' Beg You."" Other fantastic tracks here are ""Free Yourself"", ""Truth Is"", ""Selfish"", ""Don't Act Right"", and ""I Believe."" This album proves that Fantasia will go a long way from American Idol. She's actually the best of all the Idol winners, but I won't go on any further about that.If you're a fan [like I am] of some of today's youngest & hottest R&B; vocalists like Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Keyshia Cole, & Joss Stone, then you'll love Fantasia!"
3,"Disappointing, but still decent.","I love hervoice, and all the performances she's done in AI was amazing.It is good to see that she included some songs she sang on AI such as 'Summertime"" or ""You Were Always On My Mind'. They sound fabulous.However, I didn't expect her to make another Beyonce or Mary. J. Blige album. I wanter her to make the best use out of her unique and special voice.Her voice is completely hidden behind all those loud backup singers' voice, and some songs such as ""Ain't Gonna Beg' is too boring.Perhaps what she needed was not Clive Davis or Missy Elliot.What Fantasia really needed was producers with young and creative mind who actually realizes that putting some weird Indian sound at the beginning of the song is not that cool anymore. (I'm talking about the song Selfish)"
3,A different style.,"What Fantasia brings to music lovers is her different style. She has a voice like none other. She almost reminds me of Macy Gray. I was on the fence with Fantasia on AI. Some songs I thought she did OK on, some songs just hurt my ears, yet some songs sent chills down my spine. I thought she did an outstanding job on ""Chain Chain Chain"". I have listened to samples of her album, but she wasn't my choice on AI so I didnt buy the album. I knew she would get some critic feedback because of her ""quacky sound"" but she is different, and thats what we need more of...instead of the same ole sound which gets old and boring. I wish her the best career and hope her new found fame brings her a lifetime of dreams coming true."
3,Disappointingly uneven production quality,"I'm a big admirer of Fantasia's voice and stage presence.I loved her CD with the 3 songs including ""Summertime"" and ""IBelieve"". I was looking forward to the album. But whenit arrived, my overriding impression was that it was rushedinto production before it was ready. The production qualitywas very uneven across the set of selections, and I wasdisappointed in most of the new song material. I hope thatmore thought, time and preparation can go into Fantasia's nextalbum in order to do her voice and efforts justice."
4,Worth buying.,"I must admit that I did prefer Latoya on American Idol,but Fantasia has done a fantastic job on her freshman cd.Everyone please remember this is a review section, not a contest between Fantasia and Diane. Damn!!!!!! Just leave it alone!!!!!!!!!"
5,Fantasia really is Fantastic!,"I love this CD!!! I have been looking forward to Fantasia's solo effort and it was well worth the wait! She has the perfect people writing for her: Missy Elliot, Jermain Dupri, Rodney Jerkins, etc. And with Clive Davis as the producer, there was little doubt this would be a powerhouse cd. There is a nice mix of both slow jams and uptempo songs. Two favorites of mine: Baby Mama, and It's All Good. If you are a Fantasia fan, or if you just like good R&B, pick this up!"
5,The Best,"I know this young lady will always be stuck in the AI world to some people, but to me she has left the pack behind. This is the first AI CD that took a chance and made music for everyone. SHe still has her classics. Summertime and I Believe but she made me fall in Love again With Always On My Mind. SHe put her unique voice to Free Yourself and This Is Me. but the cut that lets the world know this lady has arrived is Good Lovin. That song brins me back to the good times when music was music. I have not heard a song so soulful since Giving Him Something He Can Feel. Trust me you will enjoy this cd."
5,GREAT CD Gift and Fantasia sounds Awesome!!!,"Fantasia's CD is very impressive!! She has a combination of songs from Pop to Jazz to Dance to R&B. The song combinations were very well put together and displayed Fantasia's vocal ability quite well. To compliment the CD even more, she has the best of the best in the music industry who contributed to her CD. The CD is a must buy, and will do down in history as one of the best. My favorite song from the CD today is Selfish and everyday is Summertime. The best thing I like about the CD is that you can listen to it while you are cleaning the house, cooking dinner, driving in your car, or just relaxing because it can relate to any and every person. I am looking forward to her next CD already."
5,she did her thing,"this cd has something for everyone from old school to new slow songs to club songs and introspective songs, if you like real musical talent this the cd to get She Did her Thang."
2,What do people see??,"Fantasia does have personality, and stage presense. That's pretty much it. Her cd is mediocre, nothing compared to Kelly Clarkson, or Clay Aikens. She has appeal in her personality, but her voice is much less than to be desired. She is screaming her head off, and will not have a voice when she is older, probably as a result of vocal nodes. People have compared her to Whitney...she is NO Whitnney houston. I enjoy watching Fantasia on stage, but on cd the effect of her stage presense is lost by her constant screaming."
2,Her Voice Is Reeeeealy Irritating To Me...,"....with no disrepect to her truest fans and her American Idol followers, I'd rather not listen to her. I'd prefer Clarkson, Aiken, hell, even Rueben than Fantasia, any ole day: their vocal tones appeal to my aged ears better. But, I give props to her for having gone through what she has to get her record out...."
1,"How could a record company actually record ""Baby Mama?""","This is the worst song ever and it drags down the rest of the CD!! It glorifies teenagers having babies--really smart. And a line in the song about giving ""Baby Mama's"" their own holiday!! Please spare me!! Worst album, worst choice of music."
2,I can't wait until her next cd,"I am aware that the AI winner doesn't have that much control over what goes on their first cd. I hope this is why ""Free Yourself"" is a ""blah"" cd. I love Fantasia. And would vote for her again, but this cd doesn't show the real Fantasia. Just like ""Soulful"" didn't show the real Ruben. Maybe it is because Clive produced both. Either way, I hope Fantasia, like Ruben, makes up for it and comes out swing in her sophmore cd."
1,We Love Daisy Duck!,"If you want to hear a duck quack for an hour, then this is the album for you! Let yourself drift off with the effervescent tunes of this stellar quackster. See how high the duck can quack! My, doesn't it make your ears bleed. But, if that's the type of songs you like, then this is the album for you"
5,Great Debut Album,"I must say, I was a little skeptical about her album. I didn't know what type of sound she could pull off other than gospel. But needless to say I am pleasantly surprised about this product and am extremely pleased with the result. Free Yourself is well worth the purchase. I have gotten my moneys worth and some. She takes songs that can be sung by any other artist out there and make them sound fresh and inventive. I'm really loving ""Good Lovin"". That old school vibe fits her to a T. I'm infatuated with ""Truth Is"" for it's smooth R&B feel. ""Selfish"" gets me moving with it's infectious beat. ""Always on My Mind"" is that tear jerking ballad. The album is for music lovers of all genres. I highly recommend everyone Free Yourself with Fantasia's debut album :D"
4,Fantastic Debut,"This is a really great debut by Fantasia. I love her voice, and how she wraps herself in each song. My favorite songs are Free Yourself, It's All Good, and especially Got Me Waiting. I hope this album does really well because its just that great. I only gave it 4 stars because I was looking forward to the material that R.Kelly and Scott Storch created for the album, but other than that I recommend this album to everyone."
5,Wow,"Please, you must buy this cd, this is the best cd to come out in awhile, Alicia Keys, Jill Scott, Patti LaBelle, Lauryn Hill...these all come to mind when listening to this cd...this girl is incredible...she's from American Idol, huh....this cd shows why she won...and she is the best one to come out of American Idol, to date, and I've watched all three seasons, and I've liked all of the talent that's come out of AI; but this girl, I knew she was something special, when I watched, but I had no idea...she can sing anything, R & B, Soul, Jazz, even, Hip/Hop...all of this is on this one CD, incredible....Free Yourselves to listen to the best cd I've heard this year.,,,buy it, now...don't wait...she is the real deal...."
5,one-of-a-kind and stunning,"the first time i heard Fantasia it was on Ellen and i was amazed by her unique and beautiful voice...she is a true talent and absolutely shines on songs like ""Summertime"" and ""You Were Always on My Mind""...although this cd did have some faulties...including a mislabeled song sequence...her talent still captivates....as a person who usually enjoys alternative rock and grunge...her talent is what drew me to buy this cd and i am very pleased that i did."
4,I'm Freed,"I really like this album. I know alot of people don't like Fantasia because they don't like her voice. Its what makes her unique and stand out, plus the sista can just downright blow. She got that church voice 4 real. I love ""Free Yourself"" (written by the great Missy Elliott), ""Truth Is"", and ""This Is Me"". There are a couple of songs I don't care too much for, but in others she definitely makes up for it. You can just hear the passion in her voice as she sings, it truly is heaven sent. She is one of the best female artist out there right now and I know she will continue to bless us with good music. So if you already haven't you need to FREE a few dollars bless YOURSELF!"
5,"Finally, an Idol worth idolizing!","Fantasia's album is wonderful! It's not the typical, corny stuff you would expect an American Idol winner to make. She obviously put a lot of her soul and heart into every song. She could have left the American Idol songs off, but that's what the skip button on the CD player is for. If Fantasia can continue to stay down to Earth and soulful, she should have a long lasting career with many successes."
3,A bit cliche.........,"She falls into the R&B cliche of singing about how bad her man is, and adds a rapper. But there are some highlights that make it worth while. ""Baby Mama"" while supposed to empower single mothers is a low point, just not a good song or subject. Fans of her show will love this."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am so proud of Fantasia, I think that this album is EXCELLENT. It should have gone Platinum the first day. Fantasia is an ARTIST, and I can not understand why this album has not gotten the attention it deserves. To all the people bashing Fantasia, don't listen to her music. I find it hard to believe that the people that are hating on her album know every song on it.HMMMMMMMMMMMM, It makes you wonder. Anyway, I can not wait until this album starts hitting the airwaves, Beyonce, Alicia Keys better watch out. Fantasia is on the way.......Her anthem to all of the single mothers is BRILLIANT. It is about time we are recognized...Thanks Fantasia"
5,She's Amazing!!!!,"Everybody know's Fantasia as the ""American Idol"", I feel this album will bring her to newer heights and the whole American Idol will just be a thing of the past. Fantasia has and AMAZING VOICE!!!! this album BLEW ME AWAY!!! I've followed her since the show and i'm gonna continue to follow her, if your not sure on what to do buy it or not my response would be to BUY IT!!!! it's well worth the money :)"
5,One of the Best Singers in the World,"Fantasia is absolutely breath-taking. Her unique vocals & personality are gorgeously displayed on her flawless debut, Free Yourself. Not only do you get the classics ""I Believe"" & ""Summertime"", but you also get new hits like ""Truth Is"" & ""Free Yourself"". The up-tempo tracks like ""Selfish"" & ""It's All Good"" alongside moving ballads like ""You Were Always on my Mind"" show Barrino's undeniable versatility and charisma.In fact, Barrino ranks on my list of one of the best singers in the world. With the exception of Whitney Houston, Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton & Deborah Cox, few singers have moved me to give such a high stamp of approval. Fantasia is going to be a legend. Her live performances are phenominal and her debut proves why she stole america's hearts and deserved her title."
5,I LOVED HER FROM HER 1ST AMERICAN IDOL AUDTION...,"And, I love her even more now.I received the CD for a Christmas present and, in the day after, I had the chance to sit down and take a listen. Fantasia doesn't disappoint.The CD is truly the type that I love - the kind where you can sit down, start with track one and go all the way through the end without skipping. Each song is real, special, and branded fully with Fantastia's trade mark - her originality.I do beleive somebody had it right in a previous review. She is definitely a classic in the making. Now for: David M. Murphy ""marilyn scott fan"", who lamented - 'bad, bad, barino' and went on to hype the second runner- it just smells like some regular hatin' to me.Fantastia, I rooted for you from your first audition and I'm still rooting for you now. You have it going on and the right stuff. No doubt your star will go far and I will be there to watch it rise.Peace and blessings to you my sista. You are an inspiration to us all..."
2,To purchase or not to purchase...,"Before I purchase a cd, I find using the music samples and reading the reviews (with a pinch of salt) can be helpful. Fantasia's voice gives me chills & I think she deserves the chance to pursue her success, however someone is not handling her career with care. Again, I have not even bought the cd yet, but after tasting just the samples, well, I also thought to myself, ""It sounds like all the rest of the cookie cutter R&B sound... And that cd cover??!!"" I hope no one judges Fantasia based on this cd because she really is gifted."
3,Not Bad,"This was actually a good CD. I would have given it four stars if it didn't have ""Baby Mama"" on it. That song really brought down the whole CD. I'm expecting great things from Fantasia in the future. She has great potential."
1,Fantasia: What were you thinking?,"I am a HUGE Fantasia fan, at least I thought I was. After American Idol ended, I missed seeing and hearing her so much. Then, we had to endure the six-month wait for her CD ""Free Yourself"". After much anticipation I received what I thought was going to be a wonderful experience. Instead I was shocked speechless! Of course, I LOVED the cuts: ""Summertime"", ""Always On My Mind"" and ""I Believe"". But I was not prepared for the other ten HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE cuts of what I will loosely call ""music"". Fantasia: What were you thinking when you allowed yourself to record this slop!? Don't you have any self-respect at all? I'm so disappointed in not only you, but in Clive Davis and Missy Elliot. Great music has the ring of greatness in it and the 10 cuts of ""music"" I'm referring to only have the ring of mediocrity at best. I hope this album doesn't ruin your career."
2,Dreadful,"I bought this cd the day it came out because I was a huge Fantasia fan on AI. I gave it away the day after I heard it. The cd didn't come close to her performance on Idol. That Baby Mama song was dreadful. That whole pop/Beyonce-wannabe lyrics just didn't fit her voice or her style. She honestly should have stuck closer to the jass/blues genre. I wish her luck with her Broadway show and subsequent albums and performances, but honestly if this is an indicator than she's definitely off my playlist. I was highly disappointed with this dreadful cd."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!!,"Once again, the creators of American Idol have taken the winner and turned their unique stylings into the same old, same old. I can't believe how incredibly disappointed I was in this CD. Other than the trademark screeching that Fantasia usually resorts to at the end of her songs, you can't tell this is the same girl who wowed me during American Idol.Even the version of ""Summertime"" that's on this album doesn't begin to compare with the soulful version that Fantasia did on the actual show.If you want to purchase this album for ""I Believe""...or to try to further this girl's career...go for it. But if you're expecting to hear the same wonderful voice you heard on TV...FORGET IT!!!"
1,wished I liked it better,"Loved Fantasia on AI3. Also liked single. I only liked 2 songs on this CD. Kind of like I felt about Ruben, wished his CD was more like the soul he showed on AI. I'll still buy the NEXT one."
4,Pretty darn good,"This album was actually suprisingly good. It captured the uniqueness of her voice. ""What are you doing"" is especially amazing. If you don't like her tone, don't get the album. You'd be wasting your money. People still either like her or hate her. But if you like her tone, then if your going to get 1 CD this should be it. It has an R&B Neo-soul vibe that is pretty cool!"
1,I am really disappointed,"Fantasia has so much talent and stage presence, imo, and she is from my area. She even came to a Halloween party a couple years ago, and she put some vocals into some mixed music for us, but, this effort makes me sad. I am not sure who guided her, or allowed her, or forced her to sing these songs, but, the word that comes to me is ghetto. She is so much more than all that on the album. Come one girl, do it right. If you do not have any artistic control, then stop because in my opinion, you have made a really bad album, and the songs are just so beneath you. I truly love this performer and I am so disappointed."
3,Could Have Been So Much Better,"I was kind of disappointed with this album. Fantasia did great stuff on the AI Show but somehow fell short in this album. Her personal style has been subsumed under the attempts by the producers and the songs to define what her style should be.As a result, her interpretations, which has always conveyed vitality (eg. Chain of Fools), depth of emotions (eg. Summertime, when performed live) or hope (eg. I Believe) is missing or curtailed. This is a big mistake. Big.We need her to, like she said, ""feel it, man"".It is a pity, because her talent is great. Let's hope she finds herself in the next album, like Ruben did in his second album."
5,AWESOME!! FIVE STARS NOT ENOUGH - I AGREE!!!,I absolutely LOVE this album. With the exception of Tamyra Gray's album I was so disappointed with the first American Idol winner albums. Fantasia's album has flava'. It is awesome. Even though it is her first album I think it's better than many other artists that have been around much longer. I listen to her album over and over and I haven't tired of it yet. I recommend it to everyone. I give Clive Davis a lot of props for giving Fantasia a more soulful album. This is the only AI winner album that I have actually paid my hard earned money for and it is well worth every penny. It keeps my head bobbing and my toes tapping. She can only get better from here. And I truly hope she keeps her style!!!
5,WOW,"I am speechless. This album takes my breathe away! Fantasia truly shines on this cd, singing with pain, love, heartache, and desire. You feel like she means every word she sings on this cd. A young Patti/Areatha/mary j., Fantasia is only 20 and what a voice she has. Many will come on here and try to bash her, but to do believe this album is WONDERFUL and has something from for everyone.Standout tracks for me....free yourself, you were always on my mind, good lovin, baby mama, and its all good....Every track is simply amazing...even the old songs summertime and i believe continue to highlight her true talentFantasia is truly blessed and has truly made this album a MUST BUY.."
2,She Suck,"actually i'm thinknig of giving her one star..but her uniqueness give herself a star. her voice is unique..but tt's not what attract fans! you gotta have something ppl will like..appeal to at least one kidn of ppl..but ur songs are all so..i got nothing to say..i don't think she need any composer..just 'Yeah, yeah, yeah' throughout will do...she edited the original lyrics like hell..and added 'Yeah, yeah,yeah'. this kind of ppl will be caught lipsyncing very easily..as long as she 'Yeah, yeah' at the wrong position or speed ppl will know..Why i dun like her-->she 'Yeah' too much..gets annoying-->Voice too high pitch..most of the time she's shouting-->too unique..people who loves orange can't find apple same as orange..coz though the apple is something different..tt doesn't mean they have to like it..."
2,No Broad Appeal,I was an avid Fantasia fan during AI and I eagerly scooped up her new album. However I thought it was terrible and listened to it only once and threw it out. The music was good IF you like that kind of music. Best analogy I can give is to compare it to polka music. Either you like that genre or you don't. This album was made for a limited demographic community and has zero appeal to people outside that genre. It also sounds the same as all the other female vocalists of that genre. No use of her talent - no stretch of her range. BORING and LIMITED.
3,chaos princess,"Well she is no Missy Elliot or Patti LaBelle she lacks the class of superstar, as well as the tone. She has more of a Broadway voice her redition of Summertime is beautiful I have to say, but in another few years we'll be saying Fantasis who."
1,"In the words of Simon- BLOODY, BLOODY AWFUL!","That is for sure, this girl cant sing, she is a shrieking, screaming, shouter who should not have been able to record such trash!"
1,Overrated,"To this day, I still can't believe that AI awarded the title to this contestant. Not only can she NOT sing, her voice is just downright a pain to the ears.The tracks in this album don't help improve her ""singing"" (or should I say ""sqeaking"" career) at all. They're cheesy, unoriginal, and sang badly.Save your money. Skip this."
1,Talk about the decline of society,An ebonics laden song glorifying single motherhood. Need I say more?
2,LISTEN TO ESTHER PHILLIPS INSTEAD,"Fantasia Barrino has so much talent that is being squelched by overdone electronics in the studio rather than letting her voice shine with a sensitive backup band. Therefore, listen to the real thing - - ESTHER PHILLIPS. Barino is a weak imitation of PHILLIPS right now, but with proper material and a real and sensitive small band behind her, she could match PHILLIP's excellence."
4,Surprise!,"I waited for ever to get this cd, but when i did, i was very disapointed...at first. the thing that turned me off was the cover of the cd, and the inside picture. What kind of image is she trying to give off, dressing like that and posing in that way? i thought that finally, another artist i can rely on to be a good example to kids...but she ruined that image. the first time i listened to it...i thought, what a waste of my money! but i listened closer, and found that i enjoy many of the songs. I Believe is my favorite, but there are many other good songs as well. the only thing i never pictured was fantasia rapping. as i said, although i am disappointed of her new image, i do enjoy her cd very much!"
2,What happened?,"Okay, Fantasia has a really really good voice and I kinda liked the songs on the CD. There is one thing that bugged me though:1. The cover. It's not that I didn't like her fur coat (actually I didn't) but the fact that it is OPEN and totally exposing her chest. Fantasia did not dress like that on American Idol. Kids UNDER 10 watched the show. I don't think they need images like that. Neither do I, being under 13.The songs, to me, were not like Idol. I liked Idol much better.In conclusion, SUPPORT DIANA DEGARMO!"
2,Could not get past Baby Mama,"I am sorry but I could not get past the Baby Mama song. Unlike some of the other complaints it does not bother me if people are single moms or had a child out of wedlock. The whole ""baby mama"" stuff is just so played out and ignorant sounding. There must have been a more classy way for her to get her story across and empower moms. She has a great voice but this song was beneath her, it ruined it for me."
5,Do Your Self a HUGE Favor....Buy It and LISTEN!,"Fantasia's ease with her performances, and soulful, unique vocal style will send her to the same places as singing legends are now.ok......I have to say first that I ""LOVE"" most of the songs and ""ENJOY"" ALL of the songsGood LovinGot Me WaitingFree YourselfAlways On My MindTruth IsBaby MamaI like the tracks Ain't Gon Beg / This Is Me / Selfish / It's All Good / Don't Act Right ...I will REQUIRE more listening time...but I can get my funk on just fine with these.(I Believe and Summertime don't count cuz I already ""professed my undying love to them before"")Disclaimer: I reserve the right to change my mind like any other female counterpart!!!...LOLShe will shine and give the public her heart........ AGAIN......... people will be given a NEW gift if they haven't already heard her."
5,Clive Kept His Word,"This CD is phenominal! Something for everyone. Every track is excellent. All of the producers who help her, my hat is off to you. Your really did her proud. ""Baby Mama"" should be the ""anthem"" for everyone, not just mothers. When she says ""what don't kill you can only make you stronger,"" that's for everybody. We have got to make this song an ""Anthem."" ""Don't Act Right, It's All Good"" gosh all of the songs are great. Clive Davis, you're a genius. Fantasia, thank you for freeing us."
4,Fantastic,"I love the spirit in this young performer and was anxious to buy this CD after seeing her performance on the American Music Awards. I enjoyed the CD but I felt there needed to be more focus on vocal control for better sound quality. Her voice sometimes projects like a scqeem/screem sounding a little less polished/unrehearsed. I don't want that to take anything away from this product because it has variety, energy and conviction and the collabos were appropriate and not overdone. I particularly like the track with Missy Elliot, sweet, sentimental, and melodic. And ""Summertime"" has a special place in my heart. This joint is in my heavy rotation pile."
5,LOVE THE CD,"Fantasia you did an excellent job on your debut cd, i brought the cd months ago and i still listen to it all the time and also congratulations on your 4 Grammy NominationsThe best songs are....Free Yourself, Baby Mama, This is me, Ain't gon beg, heck all the them...again you did an awesome job and i will be first on line for cd #2"
2,"I love Fantasia, but not her debut","Fantasia showed talent on American Idol but I find her voice very raspy and screechy on this....it is kind of annoying. I was a fan of her on American Idol so I thought I would give it a try, but it's not great. Another bad thing....the picture is terrible.I gave it 2 stars because I like Fantasia and her personality is wonderful, but as for the CD....sorry Fantasia. Better luck next time."
3,"IF you don`t like me, then DON`T talk to me!","OFF THE WALL...This CD is pure ""crappy mess"". I anticipated on getting this title for so long now, I don`t even like it.I thought I would, but it grew on me. NOW I don`t view it the same way.SONGS like ""Selfist(I Want U 2 Myself""/""Summertime"" & ""Good Lovin"" are not completely worth listening to, bUT she deserves 2 thumbs up for tryin with this debut and one addiditonal for not using sex to sell.... IF U canm U Should burn it."
2,Free yourself---from this album,"Fantasia can sing but she can't sing any old thing. Shame on her producers who must have told her to sing as hard and loud as she can. The title track starts off fine but flops when she does all that hoarse ad libbing. And ""Baby Mama""--don't get me started on that one, bad singing and subject matter (whatever happened to promoting family values?). The rest of the songs also suffer from questionable singing and tired lyrics. Who on earth is giving this five stars? American Idol fans or Fantasia herself?"
3,"Fantasia is Great, the CD could be better","I love Fantasia. She is ""the real thing"". But after months of eager anticipation waiting for her new CD, I found the new CD to be somewhat pedestrian, not showcasing her true vocal range or the extent of her talent. On the second or third listen I found myself thinking that the producers of the CD have taken Fantasia's truly unique talent and made it sound just like so many other forgettable RB CDs. With one or two exceptions, the songs on this CD could have been performed by any of today's popular R&B singers. Arrangements are just average. Oh, well, I'm already looking forward to the sophomore effort. With stronger songs or better arrangements, perhaps the unique talent that is Fantasia will finally get a change to really shine!"
3,"Very Disappointed, Not Hating, Just really disappointed","When I went to Wal-Mart I had Fantasia's CD in my cart along with a few others like Nelly, Destiny's Child, Chingy etc.. .they were all on sale, except for Fantasia she was regular price. I loved her so much on american idol so I'm like what the heck I'll buy her's and I put the rest of the cd's back. I popped it in my car's cd player, and the first single aint gonna beg was pretty hot.. I liked it.. but the tracks to follow had good beats, lyrics were okay,, but they didn't do anything for me.. it felt like a manufactured Fantasia not the one we saw weekly on the show.. im not hating on her,, I'm proud of her she is doing her thing.. but some artists just aren't that good when other people write their songs.. maybe she would do better if she wrote some of her own lyrics..."
2,Disappointing debut from an outstanding performer,"After being enthralled with Fantasia's outstanding performances on American Idol, I had high hopes for her debut album. Her TV performances were marked by originality, authenticity and her incredible voice. The CD on the hand suffers from over-production and too much polish that makes so many tracks sound like too many other artists whose names you can't quite remember. What's with the overpowering backing vocals? The live rendition of ""Summertime"" for example was breathtaking, the studio rendition on ""Free Yourself"" just sounds like the best take of a so-so bunch. The single ""I Believe"" really shows what Fantasia is all about, but still suffers from over production.All in all, a very disappointing debut from a performer that has so much more to offer. I look forward to her second album with enthusiasm hoping that a production team with as much talent and originality as Fantasia herself are involved."
4,Don't you know...Don't you know...,"When I first saw Fantasia, I knew she was going to win. Not because she was African American, and female...NOPE it was because she was REAL....She came to the stage with a different power, she thanked God every round, and she was one of the strongest performers. I voted faithfully for her, and yes I'm a CHICAGOAN...With that said...The ""truth is"" ""it's all good"" if you critics took the time to ""free yourself"" and stop being so ""selfish"" you could see that this is as refreshing as a ""summertime"" breeze. ""I believe"" Fantasia did a great debut and it's always room for improvement. ""I ain't gone beg you"" cause right now y'all that ""don't act right"" will see soon enough...B-A-B-Y M-A-M-ATHIS GOES OUT TO ALL MY BABY MAMA'sTHIS GOES OUT TO ALL MY BABY MAMA'sB-A-B-Y M-A-M-ATHIS GOES OUT TO ALL MY BABY MAMA'sI GOT LOVE FOR ALL MY BABY MAMA'sFINALLY A POWERFUL ANTHEM..."
4,promises a rosy future,"Despite American Idol now showing in this part of the world, and CDs by Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Clay Aiken and even Kimberley Locke available locally, J Records have obviously decided Fantasia isn't worthy of release here. What a shame as she delivers a strong debut that shows glimpses of potential great things in the future and an album that would certainly win fans here. The album tries to cover a number of styles from a couple of big ballads through Motown-flavored pop/r'n'b to more traditional r'n'b and into hip-hop territory. And while a few of the latter lack personality, Fantasia's strong and emotive singing carries the album with the singles showing her off best. With so many young singers with little vocal talent getting record contracts and having chart success, it's a pleasure to get behind an up-and-comer who really does have the goods!"
5,Fantasia IS Fantabolous!!!,"Once I popped the disc in, I knew that this was one of those CDs I could keep in player for a long time; it's so classic. Fantasia could not have a better debut album! My favorite songs are 'Got Me Waiting', 'This Is Me', 'You Were Always On My Mind', 'Free Yourself', and of course 'Summertime'. I have to say that all are my favorite; I had trouble listing those few as favorites when all of her songs have a very unique flavor. My least favorite songs are 'Good Lovin' and 'Don't Act Right' but they are still bangin' just not as much as the others. In 'This Is Me' she sounds convincingly like Brandy but I guess that's a coincidence. Brandy is also one of my favorites so I didnt mind that at all. I recommend this CD to everyone-young and old. I can't wait for the next album. You'll definitely see me at this tour. Go Fantasia......you outdid yourself with this one."
5,WOW WOW WOW,"Fantasia, why am I surprised ? Man, I'm sorry to those who disagree, but this woman can sang! I mean stop buying garbage, please buy this album. This girl has a wonderful future ahead of her. Finally, somebody who is worth your precious ears...I can oficially declare myself a Fantasia fan. I'm impressed. Congratulations Fantasia.Excellent job."
5,EXCELLENT,"Nothing else needs to be said. ""Truth is"" I am impressed and now a true fan of Ms. Fantasia. I had no idea what to expect and am blown away. Track #2 is my favorite. The anger... the passion... she's singing my pain. And the song ""Truth Is"" is for everyone who's never gotten over that first love."
5,Words cant describe how good,I am so proud of Fantasia and one day I hope I get to meet her. Each and every song you can feel how real Fantasia is. This isnt just a singing career and making it big this is her passion. I have recently gone through some things in my relationship and every song just about spoke directly to me and encouraged me to brush the dirt off and move forward. All of the songs are my favorite. I have tried to narrow it down but cant. As soon as I put the CD on the first song grabbed me and I was like what? Usually you get a new CD and you skim through it but this one just makes you want to listen to each song. I wish Fantasia the best cause she truly deserves it.
3,c'mon now,what happened to that voice we wanted to hear from American Idol? maybe it was the choice of songs but I really was disappointed.
2,"GREAT PIPES, ZERO PERSONALITY","Like most of the other ""American Idol"" graduates, Fantasia hasa very good voice, and knows how to use it. Or should I sayOVERuse it. I'll admit she's better than most of the others,but you really do get the feeling that these kids go into thestudio with no clue as to what they want to say, and that theyare PRODUCED down to the last melisma. I may be wrong, but thatis the impression you come away with. I wish her luck, she'syoung and has her whole life to learn how to sing a SONG, asopposed to HITTING THE RIGHT NOTES. Fantasia, you ARE talented;now go use that talent in a compelling way!!"
2,I don't understand,"I just don't understand why some people insist they enjoy her screeching. And I can't believe how many people insult Aretha Franklin by comparing this screechy idol to her. She doesn't have even an ounce of the talent and class Aretha has. I only gave this a 2, because people always claim you must not have listened to it if you give a 1. Well, I work with someone who threw away her hard earned money to buy this crappy album, and I have been forced to listen to the screeching and caterwauling. Just awful!!"
3,A waste of talent,"This is an album that I had high expectations for, but it seems that (other than a couple tracks, which she'd performed on American Idol) the label pushed to try and fit a lowest common denominator urban mold. Rarely is she given the opportunity to sing more than 2-3 words before the background vocalists take over the lion's share of the singing. This kid has the chops, but being a newbie had to go where they sent her. Not horrid, but not worth searching out either (wait a few months, and I'm guessing it'll hit the cutout and discount bins)."
4,Great Start to a Promising Career!!!!!!!!,Overall this is a very good cd amazing voice love the inside picture just the beginning to something to watch out for.....First three songs are Tight...Way better than a lot of stuff out there today.
2,"Not a Good Effort...Not Surprisingly, Either.","Fantasia, Fantasia, Fantasia...what happened? Okay, I went out and bought this album with Diana's, and I honestly have to say Diana's is much better. Only her I Believe song is the good one, all the rest need SERIOUS work. And like a Kid's Review said, she never dressed the way on her album cover like she did on AI.Fantasia, here's some tips for you:1) Close the coat. Seriously. You're supposed to be an IDOL.2) Get singing improvement lessons. Seriously.3) And did I mention close up the coat?"
1,Worse than Hung! (I'm serious),I don't see any great talent in this album. All songs are equally bad and annoying to listen. I just saw her latest performance in American Idol result show and felt very surprised how America could go wrong voting for this girl to be the best singer last season. Her voice is worse than average singers'. Her singing ability is not better. William Hung is an awful singer but at least it's funny to watch him. Fantasia's performance is awful and not even funny to watch. I hope American Idol pick a right winner this time.
1,Not even if it was free~~~,"If you gave me this CD I would throw it away---I have listened to clips here and can't stand any of the songs. Then I saw her on AI last night and ohmygosh---she was sooo bad with her screaming and yeah yeah yeahs. I cannot help but wonder how she ever won. This CD does not have even one good song, I would not even give her one star if possible. Save your money or buy Clay Aikens CD."
2,Flash in the Pan,"The fact that there are already 71 used CDs available for sale on Amazon--fairly soon after its release--should be a pretty good indication of the quality of this CD. I never thought Fantasia could sing well. Yes, she CAN carry a tune. The problem is, she sounds like she is singing through her nose. Every time I hear a song by her, I feel like sending her some Kleenex to clear out those nasal passages. I could not imagine listening to an entire CD of that voice.The fact that I have not heard ANYTHING on the radio by Fantasia (thank God)--yet Kelly Clarkson is ALL OVER the radio, is another indication of who has truly earned the title of American Idol. When Fantasia won--as with Ruben--I predicted that they would have (maybe) one hit and then fade to black. Thus far, the post-Kelly AI winners have done just that."
1,FREE YOURSELF from this mess.,"This chick cant sing! How on Earth did she make it on American Idol? I thought this was supposed to be the BEST in America?! If anyone was good from Season III it was Jennifer Hudson. Fantasia is not sexy and last time I checked had a child--19 year old mother? I thought this was American IDOL? Id think more people would be outraged. I could understand if she was graduated or in college, but she is not. As for the album...dont even get me started. At least work with people like Rodney Jerkins who make people who cant sing sound good (cough cough, J LO, cough cough)"
1,Annoying Voice Busts All Ear Drums!,"I've listend to the Cd and it was worse than expexted! Bad Bad Bad Bad Bad! Her voice is okay, but she doesn't sing, she screams! Thats what I hate about her!"
1,This Girl Can't Sing!,"This is the worst person to win from American Idol. I can't believe all the people who actually like to hear a duck sing. When the judges compared her to Aretha Franklin, I thought I was going to be sick! Aretha Franklin can sing, Fantasia just screams!There is not a good song on this cd. Don't waste your money! Diana Degarmo, Kimberley Locke, Clay Aiken, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and Bo Bice are much better singers. They actually have talent!"
3,Wasted Potential!,"If you like modern R&B, you'll like this album. But if you love Fantasia for her soul-bearing, original, fantastic talent, you'll be disappointed. Her debut album could have established her as her generation's Ray Charles or Nina Simone. Instead, her producers waste her talent on more of what we can get from any fly-by-night pop singer. What a waste."
2,What Happened?,"Fantasia won American Idol, but this CD will make you wonder why. The only good song on the album is ""Truth Is""; all the other songs are screechy and soon get on your nerves. I would recommend Diana DeGarmo as an alternative, but to each his own. I hope that Fantasia's next CD is better than this one..."
3,"A Little Lacking but, Fantasia can sing!","Fantasia Barrino won American Idol because of her vocal talent. First, I anticipated Ruben's release only to be sorely disappointed, and after Fantasia received the crown, I just knew she would have a slamming album. Oh Boy was I wrong. The best songs get overshadowed by the awful Baby Mama. What is this? The release has solidified the last season that I will watch American Idol. Now with that said, the songs that are good, are amazing. I just wish she could have had a solid effort.Favorites are:Truth IsYou Were Always on My MindI BelieveFree Yourself"
1,A big Disappointment!,"This was a very big disappointment, i expected more but she sounded like donald duck on helium on every song. don't waist all of your money on this Cd! Instead, buy either Kelly Clarkson's album or Diana DeGarmo."
1,Truly disappointing.,"What can I say? This CD is a complete let down from what I was expecting. The Fantasia that sings on this CD is not the same Fantasia that I voted for and loved on American Idol. The only song that Fantasia's bubbly personality shines through on is ""Baby Mama,"" and that song is cheesy, at best. Even the song that Missy Elliot wrote for Fantasia isn't all that great, either.My fear is that Fantasia is going to go along the same wayside that Reuben is currently residing in. If Fantasia doesn't up the ante with her sophomore release (if she makes it that far), I don't think she'll have the staying power that, say, Kelly and Clay have.Borrow this CD from a friend."
5,Fantasia is a STAR,"Fantasia is a breath of fresh air in today's music industry. You won't be hearing the same old stuff from her because EVERYTHING on this cd id new and hip and HOT! It is hard to believe that she is only 20 years old. She sings with style, class and soul. Move out the way Aretha... make room for Fantasia!!!"
5,GO GIRL GO !!!,"I LOVE THIS CD.I THOUGHT THE LYRICS COMPLEMENTED HER PERSONALITY. I ALSO THINK SHE REPRESENTS ALL THE HARD WORKING, SINGLE MOTHERS OUT HERE & I APPRECIATE HER DEDICATING A SONG TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE SINGLE MOTHERS. OF THE 13 TRACKS, I LIKE 11 OF THEM. IT IS VERY RARE TO FIND A CD THAT HAS SO MANY GOOD TRACKS.I'M VERY PROUD OF HER."
5,Fantasia is the Princess of Soul,All I can say is that this CD is incredible. There is something on this album for everyone from Ballads to Hip Hop and everything in between. Fantasia's remarkable spirit and incredible vocals shine through on every song. This album is going straight to the top of the charts.
5,bookends,"Large book ends are ideal for notebooks, tall and large books and other heavy items. For that purpose, you won't be disappointed."
5,jersey girl,"This brand used in NIH trials that established efficacy.I have used for 5 months. An orthopedist recommended dosage of 3 tablets per day, versus the usual 1 or 2. Takes about 4-6 weeks before you see impact. Can cause gas when combined with soda or other foods, so I take before bed-time all three tabs. Much better price here than at retails stores."
1,charge 2X for shipping,I seem to have been charged separately for shipping for each bottle.The reason I buy more than 1 is to avoid this.I wish I had read other reviews before I bought from this companyVery disappointing. I wrote to the company and got no response.Am looking for another source if anyone knows one?
3,Not Bad,Its not of a great help. But reduces the pain a little and I used these for months it reduces my shoulder pain after couple of weeks and I dont see any great effect. But i still do not have any other option as intake for Join pain relief
3,"not sure how well it works, but .....","I thought I would receive 2-pack of 108 ct, not 3-pack of 72 ct. Besides, it is not boxed as shown. Why don't you tell customers, it is not boxed for those are considering a gift. Furthermore, there is no way that I can figure out what is in it with how much of active ingredients. Isn't that supposed to be posted somewher in this ads? I checked the same product at the Wal-Mart and their price is $23.95 for each bottle. Since I got 6 of the same bottles at a price of little bit over $95. I don't see any 52% saving."
5,An Inspiration,I saw this recording on VHS and I was blown away with the very inspiring songs that were sung. I recommend this CD to anyone!
2,nice hose - rest is a waste,"Nice hose. The rest is a waste. I should have paid attn to the other reviews. I have used the hose some but the attachments don't work well together and are not quality. For instance, I was looking for a good floor attachment. This one is short - have to bend over slightly to use, it does not slide well across a wood floor on account of the bristles, and you have to physically hold the hose to the straight tubes while vacuuming. I have put it in the corner for now as it will take some time to rig up some fittings to make everything work together. The floor sweep attachment may be a lost cause. But, like I said, nice hose."
4,Big Hit,This tiger was the big hit on Christmas morning for my grandchild. It trumped the electronics and the other toys on Christmas Day.
4,Granddaughter was thrilled,I got this as a Christmas present for my five year old granddaughter. It is not perfectly porportioned as the front of the tiger is larger than the rear but she loves it. It is very impressive and attactive. Arrived packaged very well and undamaged.
5,Great Tiger!,"Saw it at a silent auction and bid on it but lost. Did research and found it was a Melissa & Doug so bought online.I foster orphan baby kittens and thought it would be a great picture prop to showcase my little ones, climbing on or snuggled up by this tiger. My foster kittens love it.It is larger than I thought, a nice head on it too."
4,The kid loves it.,Bought this for my granddaughter and she very small that she was just lay on it and falls asleep. The only problem is her older brother wants it also. Ain't life grand?
5,Amazing!,"This tiger is so beautiful is one of the gifts that my daughter loves most, when she was in Chicago she called me and ask me how is ""Tiger"" doing, she is in love, is really big, and cute, and actually really looks real, is just awesome!! We love it :o)"
2,Cheaply made carnival prize,"i bought this tiger and i recieved it today and am very dissapointed. the stuffing is hard, the fur is short and not very soft and it is not nearly as big as i thought it would be. it is closer to four feet minus the tail. i could have won this by tossing rings at bottles at an amusement park- and it probably would be bigger. this tiger bites."
4,Looks great but not the best quality,"We bought this tiger for Christmas for my daughter and we love the way it looks! It's really big and cute, looks very realistic, sometimes when you pass by the room and it lays on the bed I get a bit startled...lol the only reason didn't give 5 stars cause some of the stitches are starting to pull apart and open up. Other than that it's awesome!!"
4,tiger,"Tiger is really big and adorable. But VERY disappointed with the local delivery service. The item was delivered by a guy in a van, that was obviously smoke filled. The box and unfortunately the tiger stink horribly of smoke. I have nowhere to air him out before Christmas unfortunately and now nothing to wrap him in. Sure hope the smell goes away. And that Amazon reconsiders using that local delivery service."
5,lm-4,We purchased this Tiger to go in the frontwindshild of our motorhome for Auburnfootball games.It covers the whole dash and is large enoughto be seen
3,The service was good,"I have not had a chance to read this book just bits and pieces. Sounds a bit difficult to understand if your like me, ignorant about politics. I was happy about the delivery of this purchase thou. As soon as I am done reading Behold A Pale Horse I hope to have an easier understanding about this matter and I will start on my journey on reading TREASON."
1,Nothing new here,"This book is okay but relies in part on whacko conspiracy theory cites where mainstream academic cites are available. It is not a scholarly work but is a good introduction to ""reality"" politics and government. It lacks credibility, not only because its author(s) remain anonymous but also because many of the ideas, opinions, and theories presented are not adequately supported. A ""dangerous book"" this isn't -"
2,this is way breakable,"i bought this on amazon and when it came in the mail and a opened the toy's package the leg broke right off as soon as i pulled it out of the box i was very disappointed and i tried to use the display stand it came with and the stand broke right in half, i do not like this toy mostly a display piece and not for younger children. after i purchased this i watched video reviews of other nightmare before christmas toys and they had the same problem, in one review the toy actually broke right in the middle of the video. later i found out all of those toys in the reviews were all from the toy company NECA. so i will not by any products from NECA again"
1,Ordered spray for boy...received spray for girl!,"Ordered this spray for my 10 year old nephew. It took 10 days to arrive, however once received, it was the wrong spray. I received the GIRL version. I called immediately and spoke to customer service who confirmed my order was placed for a BOY, however could not send the correct item, until I returned the wrong item (and until it was received on their end). There was not enough time to send it back and receive the correct one, so now I am stuck with spray for a girl. The representative I spoke to, could not even tell me if the BOY colonge was in stock. Very disappointed!!! Rep offered nothing to accomodate me for THEIR error. Will not order from them again."
3,Doesn't stay closed easily...,"The compartments are a little large for the standard all natural eggs that we buy from a local farm. It is better in the cooler than having soggy egg containers, but it certainly isn't waterproof and doesn't stay closed well on its own."
5,This worked great!,Item kept eggs all safe and crack free! I would reccommend this for other campers. One always uses many eggs when camping and this was a plus!
3,Okay for eggs,"I bought this to take eggs camping with us. It worked okay. The eggs rattled around in the container and I was worried they would break so I used a paper towel to cushion the eggs. I didn't loose any eggs, even though we were off roading in the desert and it was very bumpy."
5,Great idea,"These work very well. I thought I got a good value @ 5 and some change, until I went to WalMart today and they were 2.88. Great product though and would recommend to anyone."
4,Does what it's designed to do.,"This product does exactly what it's designed to do. Place eggs in container. Close container. Place container in cooler with ice. Eggs arrive at destination un-cracked. I completely agree with another reviewer that said it's cheaper at Walmart, by a few dollars even, but I, too, would rather give my money to Amazon. The only reason this got 4 stars from me is because it's a little pricey on here."
4,Egg holder for camping,"Worked great for camping, kept eggs all from breaking and getting wet in the cooler, would recommend this to anyone goingCamping."
2,Take a trip to your local store!,"I thought this was a great thing to have for our camping trip and ordered it online and paid over $8.00. I was later embarassed to find that I could have bought it at the local discount store for $1.88! I like the convenience of buying online, but I certainly would have made a trip to the store had I realized it was readily availble (in the camping section). The product itself is fine and will serve it's purpose to protect the eggs."
4,good egg conainer,"This egg container works very well to keep eggs from breaking, but it is a little difficult to open. Good product over all."
4,Original 'London Symphony',"I loved this recording when it first came out. Hearing the original music was very interesting and for some reason, I thought the sound was fantastic. The recorded sound is actually not that great: a relatively brittle bass, good dynamic range but not demonstration quality, and all together overly sweet-sounding. I think the LSO plays really well here, and get the feeling they enjoyed playing this original version recorded here for the first time. I love the addition of Butterworth to this disc. Chandos re-released this recording in SACD that presents little additional detail than that released on this standard definition disc. While the original version of the 'London Symphony' is interesting, it is not Vaughn Williams' final take on the music, and as such I prefer recordings of the revised music. For die hard RVW fans, this is a must, but for those intersted in obtaining a great 'London Symphony,' I suggest looking for Previn-LSO."
5,Record of the Year,"Not only did this recording of the original version of Vaughan Williams's Second Symphony win the Gramophone Award for Best Orchestral Recording but it was selected as the best recording of the year.I agree with all of the accolades of the previous reviewers. What sets this recording apart is that it makes familiar music new and exciting. We can now judge whether Vaughan Williams was correct in making his cuts or, as many of his friends thought, he should have left it alone.The Banks of the Green Willow by George Butterworth is also a wonderfully played and unforgettable work that complements the symphony. This is a must have disc for admirers of Vaughan Williams's music and a solid introduction to new comers. Highly recommended."
4,Great and not-so-great games!,"This is a great pack for a wonderful price. The games Master of Orion II and Civilization II are some of my favorite games ever! The other two, well, Deadlock is okay, but I'd like it without a goal besides controlling the planet. Star Control III I can't understand."
4,Cheap,"Civ II is great, I havent played Master of Orian, Deadlock, or Star Control 3 but alll four of them for $10 is a great bargan."
3,Ryoma deserves more,"Jensen is a great scholar, but this is basically scholarship from the 1950s. It would have taken a lot of work to rework it using work done on Ryoma over the past 40+ years, but it would have been worth it. Further, it is an academic work and so of course he cannot say anything in a straightforward way. Still, it has a lot of interesting (though often dated) information and is a careful analysis of Japan at the end of the Tokugawa period--where Ryoma enters the picture he is mostly an example of how a person of his rank and ability came to grips with the changing society. So, while a must read, it is also (I hope) a stepping stone to a full biography of this interesting character."
4,Wonderful tool for teaching about slave resistence.,"This book is a great tool for teaching about slave resistence in the antebellum South. Sidbury gives a detailed description of the plans and strategies used by Gabriel Prosser, and how the whites of the South reacted to the threat of rebellion. This book outlines the process of how African Americans resist racism and the institution of slavery. I used the book in one of my college classes, and it shed a lot of light on a subject that is rarely touched upon in secondary schools. It is a wonderful tool for teaching about slave resistence the United States and a great read for anyone who is interested in the subeject of slavery and slave resistence, especially from an Afro American point of view."
1,Never received the order...,"I would love to write that this vest, tie, customer service and buying experience were great... BUT, I ordered it with expedited delivery service and have yet to recieve it one month later. The seller provided me with information that the post office requested in order to look for it, BUT he didn't reply/respond to my phone call when I tried to do a follow up. I imagine that if the item was returned to him he would have notified me. I can't say that the seller is at fault, but I'd have liked to have felt better taken care of as a customer. Lesson learned - insist of insurance and tracking. Over 30 dollars down the drain and more importantly the event that I needed the vest/tie for is long since over...GT"
4,Great Series,"If you have read the manga of this series, you may be a bit disappointed at some alterations, but that's pretty much to be expected with any anime. The anime of this series is still great, and delves into each character's storyline and role in the entire plot quite nicely. Very action-oriented, with twists, drama, and even a bit of humor here and there ... that's what makes X/1999. CLAMP has never failed to amaze me with their solid storylines and amazing art styles. I definitely look forward to Part 2 and hope to add it to my collection soon."
3,Too Much Formulaic Action,"This series starts out so entirely confusing that it takes three episodes to actually understand what is going on. Even then most of it doesn't make a lot of sense.It has a lot of the flavor of a company putting out a product based on customer surveys instead of a well written story turned into a film.Still, better than nothing even though you have a hard time identifying all of the various characters who all look the same."
5,A call to Mission Work,"As a missionary myself i came accross these two guys on the God Channel and was blown away by their commitment to ""go into all the world and preach the Gospel"" as the Word of God tells us.I was very challenged about my walk with God to do the same after watching the Dvd."
5,divas in spanish,"wow i was shocked ... this was really good . my favorite track on the album is ""amar es para siempre"" by jennifer lopez ...... i couldn't believe that was her singing, she sounds so nice ...... the others did an amazing job also .. good stuff i love it"
5,only one,Definately there's one singer in all the cd that stands out and it is the famous MaRIAH CAREY who is for sure the best english singer ever and with this single in spanish she is so much better Te estoy pensando.... My all The rest of the singers reallyu [stink] and for last I cant believe you dare to compare the amazing voicce of La Mariah to the [stinky] voice of Simpson.
2,Average,"The information throughout the book was very beginner level. I consider myself to be a pretty savvy and intensive user and was looking for more details, particularly relating to database migration, and it didn't even get into that area. My overall impression is that someone simply copied all the Help topics and placed them in a book. It may be of use if you've never used Act before."
2,"Good for beginners, I guess","The last version of Act! I have used was Act! 2000 and would consider myself an expert user of that product. I joined a new company that was using Act! 2006, so I thought I would get a reference book for the product and chose this one. This book is ""just OK"". Good for someone who has never used Act, I suppose.As I looked to design a new layout for my recruiting needs and worked to figure out how to intergrate Outlook, I could not find ANY of the answers I was looking for in this book. I'm not kidding. Literally, anything I looked for an answer on was not included in this book. Considering the title of this book, I would expect more.It's OK as a basic explainer of the features, but for depth, one shoud look elsewhere."
3,Alex Garland fans...beware,"The Tesseract, the book, written by Alex Garland is the best fiction book that I have ever read. This film adapation, directed by Oxide Pang Chun, is LOOSELY based on the book. It has a similar setting, a run down hotel in Thailand. Similar characters, a drug-runner, psychologist, and street kids. But, not the same heart, not the same connections between the characters, and definitely not the same language. What makes Garland's books so wonderful is his masterful prose to describe a scene. Oxide Pang Chun's film does not do the same thing.As far as those who have no knowledge of Garland's book, perhaps you might be intrigued by the non-sequential scene structure and the intermingling of the characters. For those of you were wowed by the book, do yourself a favor, and use the 96 minutes to read it again."
2,Nothing Like The Book,Not a bad movie but nothing like the book. Got a bit silly in places. Great for the Bangkok scenery. Fans of the book will be dissapointed.
2,Get a better one,"From the picture it looks like a good helmet, but it comes in two pieces and you have to snap them together which can be hard to do and comes apart. If you do get this, buy some glue too, to hold it together. My three year old son wanted a Stormtrooper Helmet for Christmas sooo bad, so i thought this would do. yeah he did not know the difference but i feel bad for not spending a little more and getting him a nice one."
2,You get what you pay for,"Flimsy and kinda low quality. Most of the decals are actually stickers that are hastily applied, some of which were peeling off when I took it out of the package. The parts that ARE painted began chipping off almost immediately. I might have a weird shaped head, but the helmet wobbles a lot while wearing it, and it's incredibly difficult to see out of the eyeholes. The front and back of the helmet are held together with flimsy plastic clips, so the pieces of the helmet don't fit together all that well.On the whole, it served it's purpose as a cheap, last minute Halloween costume... But if you're looking for a collector's item or display piece, spring for a more expensive helmet."
5,"these old bones,hello god, stairway to heaven are brillant!!","what can i say about this album, its brillant, there is not a bad song on this album, wasnt much on bluegrass music till i heard this album, ""these old bones"" is a great mountain story and i love how dolly plays the old woman in the song, ""raven dove"" and ""hello god"" are two of my personal favs, the just send chills thru me, love it, ""stairway"" is an instant classic for dolly now, love ""dagger thru the heart"" dolly has never sounded better an an album and bluegrass fits her so nice, i beg everyone who is debating on getting this album , buy it !!!!!"
5,Taking risks and being successful at it,"I like Dolly Parton. I have always enjoyed her movie performances and pop songs that tend to crossover to popular radio. Halos and Horns has moved me in many ways. Few artists can make you laugh, reminisince, and cry during the course of their albums.""These Old Bones"" is a wonderful story that you want to listen to over and over. She shows her story telling talents in this track and I couldn't help but smile and then mourn later in the song. This is the song that I keep going back to and I hear it in my head all day at work. It makes me smile!She has a positive message in all songs. Do what is right and don't judge. Halos and Horns is a great tune that all people should be able to relate to. I just can't put the album into words. It is a great little album where Dolly takes some risks and in doing so finds success in making memorable music."
5,Dolly's done it again,"Dolly Parton has had a slew of creative success behind her past few albums, so its no surprise once again she's turned in a commanding performance on HALOS AND HORNS her newest offering. The album opens with the title track, which has excellent harmony vocals. The album has interesting concepts, for one she covers two well known songs: Bread's ""If"" and Led Zepplin's ""Stairway to Heaven"". As well two of her own past hits get retreatment, ""What a Heartache"" and ""Shattered Image"". The remaining 10 songs are all brand new, and some of her most inspired. ""Hello God"" recalls 9/11 and offers peace, ""These Old Bones"" has Dolly role playing, ""I'm Gone"" is a fun quirky leave-your-man kind of song. The album's first single and video is ""Dagger Through the Heart"", and Dolly does heartbreak well. Overall HALOS AND HORNS is another winner, so be sure to add it to your collection."
5,Wonderful!!,"I've been a fan of Dolly for many years, but I am truly amazed by this CD. It is simply one great song after another. Its hard to pick a favorite song, but if I had to it would be ""These Old Bones"". What a brilliant song/work of art. Its a sweet and sad story told in a bold and beautiful fashion. I am moved to tears every time I hear it. You go Dolly!! Other favorites.. Halos and Horns, Sugar Hill, Hello God, Shattered Image, I'm Gone, Raven Dove, Dagger Through The Heart, If Only, John Daniel, and Stairway to Heaven. If you want a great collection of country music, then buy this CD at once! Its Dolly Parton at her very best. Pure ""magic"""
1,Not a True SACD,"If you are looking for a bluegrass album to play on your new SACD player, avoid this one. While my system works fine with another Hybrid SACD (Dark Side of the Moon), on this disk there is no use whatsoever of the center, surround, or bass channels in SACD mode. It is recognized by the player as a SACD, but it does not play as one. I am not saying I disagree with the mix, I am saying there is no content on those channels. When I play it on my standard CD player the sub-woofer kicks in, just as I would expect.I also am not commenting on the content of this CD. You can find those reviews in the listing for the standard version of this CD."
2,Third Time Ain't a Charm,"Following on the high-heels of THE GRASS IS BLUE and LITTLE SPARROW, Dolly Parton's HALOS AND HORNS is a sad return to the schlocky material and overwrough arrangements that marred most of her recordings from the 1980s and '90s. Parton can be quite a profound writer, but here she opts for cutesy (e.g., ""Sugar Hill,"" ""These Old Bones"") too often. ""These Old Bones,"" which celebrates mountain mystics, just doesn't work. ""If"" doesn't deserve to be revived -- nor does the faux-bluegrass reworking succeed. And, although Parton gets an ""A"" for effort, the cover of ""Stairway to Heaven"" fails. One has to wonder why, if she feels compelled to change the arrangement and the lyrics she bothered to cut it at all. The background vocals are way too heavy, and even some of the bluegrass instrumentation is overdone -- sounding less like Bill Monroe and more like Dollywood."
1,"Sounds like Dolly, but not Bluegrass",I read early reviews that touted this CD as great bluegrass music. It reminded me more of the stuff Dolly sang in the late 60's and 70's. It did not remind me of bluegrass.
4,"A Perfect Album, Almost...","I am recent Dolly convert, thanks to the Grass is Blue and Little Sparrow, two of the best albums I own, so I could hardly wait for Horns and Halos.It is a bit shy of the success of her last two...In ""These Old Bones"" Dolly sings in an old crone's voice, and, well, it gives me the full on Heebie Geebies and has my diving for the Fast Forward button everytime.""Hello God"" to me, is not up to Dolly Standards... a little cloying.Other than that 12 great tracks. ""Stairway to Heaven"" is brilliant. I was worried when i read she was covering it, but it is perfect... Raven Dove and John Daniel are two spiritual stand-outs. I can't say enough about Dolly... She writes such deep lyrics. On this album she sings about giddy love and deep pain and you feel it right along with her. She is one of our great talents."
4,Songs Rated/Sugar hill tastes yummy!!!,"Here are all the songs rated from 0-55 being the best and 0 being the worst#1 Halos And Horns 3/5 -The song is OK it gets tireing after a while#2 Sugar Hill 5/5 -I Love this song but around the end has the best parts#3 Not For Me 4/5 -It is quite a sad song but pretty slow#4 Hello God 5/5 -This is more gosple than bluegrass and alot of people think that it is overproduced but I dont have a problem with it#5 If 3/5 -Not The best song but it is OK#6 Shatterd Image 4/5 I like the older version better#7 These Old Bones 5/5 This is my favorite song on the CD#8 What A Heartache 1/5 This is the worst song on the CD#9 Im Gone 4/5 is a fun song#10 Raven Dove 2/5 I dont like her voice on this song#11 Dagger Through the heart 4/5 -Good Song#12 If only 3/5 -I did like it but is a little sad for me#13 John Dainel 4/5 -This is an older song that dolly wrote but never got recorded until now, The chorus is great!#14 Stairway to Heaven 5/5 -It Leaves Me Speechless"
4,Summer Fun,"Really enjoyed this funny & romantic adventure. It's perfect summer reading. Lots of love and laughs from Allie Shaw's not-so-impossible heroine, Deborah Edgerton. She's a character borrowed from Shaw's first book, The Impossible Bride -- which I also recommend highly."
4,Happy Music,"So I got this blastin at the gas station, and a customer says ""You like that New Orleans music?"" Well I considered it to be Minnesota Rockabilly, but hey, whadda I know.This ain't bad, but compared to ""Hubba Hubba"" this is a little tame.It's rock AND roll and goes well with old cars and beer."
1,From a students perspective,This book would be good for someone who already knows calculus and wants to refresh their skills. In the mathmatical examples there are gaps where more explination is needed. If The book where more thorough in its explinations then the student could learn the subject with a lot less trouble.
5,Quick and Well Balanced,The best hand-held hack saw that I have ever used. There are some jobs that I can do in less time than it takes to pull out the cordless reciprocating saw.
5,DEWALT DW3970 12-Inch High Tension Hack Saw,"A great hack saw, very comfortable to hold. Very solid built. Totally worth a few extra $ to me over cheaper saws. A hack saw is a must have tool for most tool boxes."
4,Very handy tool,It's a great saw with a nice design. My only issue is with the jab portion. A tightening screw in the center of the saw to reinforce the blade would make things much easier and reduce flex. Still a must have tool to have around the house.
3,This was indeed a splendid hacksaw,"So a person might wonder about the 3-star rating I've given it. That is about the only way I have of protesting the piece-of-trash blade some idiot manager at Dewalt shipped out with my saw.Though I already had a much cheaper ""tension"" hacksaw, I was fiddling with the new one to get a feel for using it. After I took out the blade, I was quite unable to get it back in place without using some kind of mechanical vise. After a while it dawned on me to try an old blade from the workshop in the garage. When it dropped into place with ease, I compared the two blades. The pin holes in the new blade were almost 2 mm out of position. Were all Dewalt blades this way? I dug out the package of ten new blades I'd ordered with the saw and they were all OK.This fine saw was almost returned to Amazon because the aforementioned Dewalt idiot was disposing of some seriously out-of-spec hacksaw blades by shipping them with new saws."
4,big & stout...,"Strong & solid. This saw doesn't flex much at all. The handle is a little too large for my liking. It would be nice if it was slightly slimmer. I've got pretty big hands, but I found my right hand a little stiff after cutting through a metal tube. Also, the blade it comes with isn't very good. But, I wasn't expecting it to come with a blade at all. So, I suppose I can't really complain about a free blade, now can I?"
2,not as good as it claims,"First, note that it does not have 160 pages, it is 148 including everything. Second while there are 26 photographs and one drawing they aren't particularly good quality nor are they all nudes. The 54 ""stories"" or ""letters"" from readers aren't particularly edgy or racy, just average quality written by average guys."
5,By The Book,"SEDUCTION BY THE BOOK kicks off the GYPSY INHERITANCE series with a look into the world of a lonely and disillusioned widower. Nicholas Scoville is a wealthy European aristocrat plagued by guilt and suffering from injury.Annie Riley is the bright and energetic youngest daughter of a big Irish-American family whose longing for independence takes her to a remote island as a personal physical trainer.A Gypsy's gift book of fairy tales and a wild hurricane both intervene in the employer-employee relationship creating a powerful story of self-deception and discovery.LINDA CONRAD takes the reader to a place of incredible beauty, long buried secrets and overpowering passion. A story you won't forget."
3,not too impressed with this one,"Generally an okay read although I thought the conflict between the two main characters could have been a bit more realistic. The heroine of the story complained she didn't like the hero making decisions without consulting her. To me it feel flat because the decision he made was based on something she said she wanted, a decision she made without consulting him I might add, and then she had the gall to get mad about it? What? Also his big moment of clarity was based on the fact that he realized he'd been acting like a controlling SOB, but I never got a sense of that throughout the rest of the story. It came across more like something thrown in at the last moment to create conflict. Definitely could have been written better."
4,I'm glad I read it!,"This is an enjoyable book, thanks to Keady's easy style and wit. The confession of Philpot Emmet is one of the funniest descriptions I've read in some time, I laughed hard. Maybe it's because I'm an Irish Catholic. I would have been a bit more comfortable with the book if it omitted the final collision Phelim and Catherine. It seemed too extreme for the otherwise light-hearted and affectionate look at a society that never really existed yet lives on in more ways than we'll ever admit!"
2,A little too cute for me...,"Celibates and Other Lovers is a novel written like a series of intertwined short stories, never quite coming together as a true novel should. Taking place in the village of Creevagh, this slight book is an example of ""cute"" Irish literature, with its silly characters, the expected Irish wake, and the overwhelming authority of the Roman Catholic church; all pushed together to form this superficial look at rural Ireland in the 40's and 50's. (Although you rarely get a good sense of time period other than the occasional pointed reference.) On the other hand, my mother, a first generation Irish-American, loved this book and found it to be very truthful, so I might not be the perfect audience for this one."
2,"No sir, I didn't like it.","It's true. If you read John Fante before and liked it, then these readers are the best deal out there. I got one for the Beats and Charles Bukowski and they are my favorite books. But if you've never read John Fante before -- like me -- I'd read him first. I like most books and couldn't get past the first five pages. Oh, and speaking of Bukowski, if you are thinking of getting this book because he's one of Charlie's favorite authors -- like me -- then definitely don't bother. It's nothing like ol' Charlie.Just sayin'."
4,Easy Setup,"I reviewed both the Delta and the Jet. The main reason for deciding on Jet was how easy it was to access the blades. The blades are easily gotten to with ""no motor in the way"". Blades can easily be remove and replaced within 15 minutes, including setup."
4,Better than a lot of others,"This may not be the Butch and Marlene story that Tanenbaum has written, but mediocre Tanenbaum is better than the best of John Grisham. Marlene goes on a tangent that is one of the best parts of this book when she gets filthy rich and cannot get enough shopping or enough vintage wine. Lucy is her mother's daughter all the way. Butch is really left more confused than usual, but manages to cope. If you are not yet a Butch and Marlene fan, start with the first and read them in order. Wouldn't you love to see Cher play Marlene in a movie!"
4,Enemy Within,I liked this book alot!!! The parts of Marlene & Butch are well done. As are the parts of Lucy & David Grale!
1,Boring,"This was my first book by this author and my last. This book has over 500 pages; gave it my best shot to get throughthe wordiness of this book that goes nowhere. I put it down at 200 pages and can't read anymore. 200 pages and thestory droans on with no life. Its about cops the D.A. office and his family, but who cares.On to something better.Dont bother with this"
1,Has Robert Tannenbaum Totally Lost It??,"I sometimes wonder if people actually read the same book I did after glancing at some of the reviews on this site, but with this book I can't believe what I was reading with the reviews of this one. I have read all the Butch Karp/Marlene novels from the start, thoroughly enjoying all of them. However I draw the line with this book,one of the most boring reads I ever attempted. The book starts out well with a car chase and shoot out but then goes totally downhill. I only got up to page 132 and gave up waiting for something to happen. Absolutely nothing happened beyond the above mentioned scen?? A few legal arguments with Butch and the DA, some banter with his associate, and a basketball game with Butch playing against Lucy, COME ON! This book was totally dead and should be buried, a real pitty as some of the other books in this series have been really good."
2,Disappointing....,"This book is so boring, that I had to plow through it..I have enjoyed his previous books but not this one...it's like one big lecture, and no excitement..Marlene is over the edge...next time I will definitely check his out at the library....and if it is good I will then consider purchasing the next one after that one...the only reason I finished this one is because I had invested dollars from my ""book budget""...."
4,A Re-issue Of A Classic.,"There were Supremes albums and there are Supremes albums but this one is a re-issue of ""The Supremes Sing ""Holland Dozier Holland,"" a classic. This album was paired with the album ""More Hits By The Supremes"" and twice re-issued as a twofer, first for an 80's Japanese pressing, then a 90's European pressing. When I saw that this was available again in a 90's single version, I jumped at owning it again while hoping this would be a 20 or 24 bit stereo re-mastered product. I am disappointed to find that this album is a 16 bit one instead of 24. ""Remove This Doubt"" is the song most desired here because it is not available on any Supremes recent anthologies nor hit compilations remastered for 24 bit. That being said, all of the music here is excellent. 4 stars, not 5."
5,Outstanding Album,"On this rare album, almost every song is excellent.I used to see them play at the Union Bar in Northeast Minneapolis in the 70's around the time this album originally came out. They played with such rich melodic intensity and wonderful harmony - backed by a multi-piece brass band. There is a jazz/soul, even disco feel to their music. I remember hearing them play many of these songs back then.On a quiet evening, in a remote Minnesota town, if one listens carefully, one can still hear their powerful rhythms wafting from some small local bar into the night air.Or catch them almost every year at Taste of Minnesota on July 4th weekend in St. Paul.James Walsh still leads this band which includes several other original members. (Bob Jones & Chico Perez)"
5,james walsh gypsy band,"this is a very talented group of excellent players & vocalists,who form a solid band comparable to tower of power,blood,sweat & tears,& chicago.why didn't anybody get behind this band & give them exposure.who knows what happened to them,as I believe this is their only release.skip the first track,but all else on this is absolutely terrific.the arrangements are precise,intelligent works constructed with soul.a hidden treasure,for sure.worth the cost."
3,A treasure??....at $999.99 it better be....,"I have the first 4 cd's from the 1970's by this band..They are fantastic...The later albums recieved mixed reviews from fans...as the original band was long gone....except for James Walsh.My opinion on bands that keep using a name with only one original member remaining....basically living on the coattails of the original bands reputation.....Maybe James should christen the NEW band with a NEW identity. I am sure they sound similar to the original Gypsy band....That would be like going to see The Beatles....only to see Paul McCartney backed by new members playing a few old classics and more of their current material.Am sure this is a great CD and they are a great band.....but for $999.99, anybody shelling out this kind of cash for a CD....definitely has more budget than brains.'Nuff said"
1,Only 1 plugin. Very bad deal.,"For a price above what one would pay at the local CVS, one might expect more than a single plug-in. The whole ""list price is $52"" thing is deceiving. A single plug-in for $6 is not a deal. Avoid this one!"
1,You only get 1 refill. Bad deal.,I bought this thinking I would get at least 3 or 4 refills. To my surprise I opened the box when it arrived to find only 1 refill.
4,What Are You Waiting For?,"This is one of my favorite mass choir recordings. My favorite songs are Yes to Your Will, Joy, How Much Do I Owe and Oh Bless the Name Jesus. All wonderful and powerful songs. If you don't own this CD yet, what are you waiting for?! This is a definite must have for your gospel music collection!"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I got this based on a fellow homeschooler's suggestion and I must say it just didn't feel thorough. My daughter kept asking about the first page about going to the quarry so I think the story line was a bit confusing as well. I'm hoping there are slightly better books out there to teach about money, but maybe this is the best? I would love other suggestions."
5,perfect condition,I was very happy with this item. It was in perfect condition and my granddaughter was very happy to use it to save money
5,SOULFUL SONGSTRESS!!,"From the opener ""Sad Eyes"" which is a glorius ballad, this is the beginning of a wonderful vocal experience. ""No One's Ever Seen This Side Of Me"" which was penned by Ms. Manchester is a cooker. Melissa's voice is powerfully rousing on the funky ""Stand"". The closing song ""The Warmth of the Sun"" (penned by Brian Wilson & Mike Love) is a moving tribute to one of the Beach Boys most brilliant works. This is a must-have CD for loyal Melissa fans, or anybody who appreciates fine vocalists."
4,enjoyable novels,"Good novels with same characters throughout the various stories - a little romance, a lot of mystery and some good, quirky and entertaining personalities."
4,A great cop even without a donut!,"Hamish Macbeth is a Bobby in a small town and tries to keep everything locked up at night and local problems ironed out and running smoothly, but then MURDER raises its ugly head and Hamish has to solve the case quickly to make sure that one of the locals did not do it! He turns over every leave and rock and finds the bad seed...each time he is successful...his bosses allow him to stay in the town a little longer rather than promoting him because he refuses to move. This is a mystery about writers!....Cool....and the local writers in Scotland are flocking to learn the craft, but when the smokes clears...someone has killed the teacher! This will never do, soHamish is on the scent. This is a great series and I enjoy them very much on my Kindle."
2,Don't Bother,"I always have been a fan of the Hamish Macbeth series, and have anxiously awaited every new release. The newest installment in this series was a huge disappointment. It was poorly written; the book just didn't flow like her previous ones have. The plot was weak, the characters were two dimentional and lacked the usual quick dialog, and the ending was terrible!!I would highly recommend you reread one of the earlier books rather than waste your time on this one. Hopefully the next will be better. Hamish deserves it."
4,Very Good Cover,"This product is inexpensive and does the job. It does a good job at giving you a better ""grip"" on the wheel. A word to the clueless - it does not just slip on and you're done... you need to lace it around your wheel for a secure fit. Overall, very nice."
3,eh. Better than slip on covers. Easy to tear.,"Make sure you heat it up well or it'll break. After my first one broke I put the 2nd in the dryer on low for a few minutes and it went on fine. It was too narrow for full coverage and I got a small rip trying to stretch it. But it fells much better than the slip on covers, and it's cheap. I'd but it again but would prefer a higher quality one if I can find it."
4,Kids 'n Money,"Whitcomb's ideas are generally intelligent. He signs contracts with his kids to teach them the value of money and his concept is sound. Learning to be frugal (not wasteful) at an early age makes it much easier to become a successful handler of money in your adult years. My only beef is the author's frequent suggestion that charity comes first. It is much more reasonable to put away part of your earnings as savings first, then live within your means, and finally give to charity, if you are able."
3,"Great book, if you have the means to implement it.","I got this book at the library, looking for resources to teach my 6 & 7 year old about money. This was totally the wrong book for that, it is more for junior high and up. But I still read the book cover-to-cover because the author was so entertaining.If you have the resources to do this, and can afford for your children to make mistakes, the ideas are great. (He does outline ways to limit your children's mistakes to a certain dollar limit, and by all means, these are cheaper than bailing a college student out of credit card debt later on.) However, if you're living paycheck-to-paycheck yourself, there's not a lot in here that you'll be able to implement."
3,Non-Disney version,"Similar, but more kid focused than the Disney version. And a bit closer to the actual book.The Caucus race song drags on far too long however but my niece is usually glued to the screen during the Mad Hatter's coloring song.This was done in an Asian lab and has the distinctive animation similar to Heathcliff and other afternoon cartoons."
1,boooooooring,"Just because you can play an instrument and sing does not mean you should make an album or assume that you are in league with ""classic rockers"" such as Zep or Bad Company,even. Sheesh these guys are dreadful. Save your money. Go to a local club in your town, have a few pops, listen to a live band with dreams of hitting it big. You sure as hell don't need this. The rest of you reviewers please stop cheapening the 4 or 5 star ratings; if you don't know this is a dog stop review all together."
4,Great replacement for an Overpriced Standard (MS)!,"I haven't had this product long enough to give a full review but, in my long experience with Office suites, I find StarOffice 6.0 to compare (and possibly surpass?) MS office suite Pro for Windows XP. There are a few items that are not available compared with the MS suite such as designating certain default configurations to basic programs (i.e., Excel).My only regret so far is that an e-mail program had not been included as part of the package (I much prefer Outlook 2002 over Outlook Express).I am recommending this to my friends and relatives as an economical way of having MS application compatibal programs"
3,Spreadsheet Too Clunky,"I never considered myself an ""advanced"" user of Excel, so I was hopefull that StarOffice would be advanced enough to meet my modest spreadsheet functionality demands. I was mostly disappointed after spending several hours trying to set up buttons to accomplish my most frequent requirements. One after another, setting up button functions involved work-arounds, compromises on results, or spending too much time clicking buttons and menus. If I was interested in spending that much time and attention in formatting and editing spreadsheets I would have continued with my old 1-2-3 classic. To be fair, it does have some well-thought out features, but in the end I decided that if my time (and attention) is worth anything I need to have a more functional spreadsheet.I don't feel ""ripped off"" however and think it is probably worth the price even if I only end up using the presentation (slideshow) program."
3,Cheaper than M$ Office,"Many people voted for StarOffice simply because it is cheaper than MS Office or hoping that it will force MS to lower prices on its MS Office sometimes in the future. I personally don't agree because people shouldn't compare StarOffice to MSOffice head to head, but with other alternatives as well. For a little more ... people can get some better suites like Works Suites or Corel Family Pack. For family users, I'll recommend Works Suites for its generous software bundle while for office users, I'll recommend Corel Family Pack as its spreadsheet is 100 times more powerful than StarCalc. I use StarOffice simply because it works well with my Linux system. I suggest people considering StarOffice take a look on the reviews on Works Suite & Corel Family Pack in Cnet before making the decision."
4,"fabulous office suite, especially for the price","my one complaint with star office is that it's a little bit iffy if you're converting to PDF format.other than that, it's at least as full featured as MS Office (and how many Office features does anyone *really* use?), but at roughly 1/4 the price.it's definitely worth the price tag."
1,"Far too clunky, and poorly written compared to MSOffice XP..","What can I say I am a programmer and I personally like Microsoft software a lot. Why, because it is very well written and extensive. After trying both Star and MS Office, I can honestly say I was much more productive with MS Office. MS Office XP has application crash recovery, and full intigration with the Windows XP interface, kernel, and data security features of the NTFS file system. While it is true that MS Office is expensive, it has never been more true than in this situation that ""you get what you pay for.""Do yourself a favor and get a real Office suite like MS Office or if you just can't see yourself buying a MS product then try Lotus SmartSuite Millenium or WordPerfect Office 2002, they will yield much better results in the long run"
1,Just use MS Office and be done,"The functionality of this software product leaves a lot to be desired. You can purchase MS Office and have the complete package and be very pleased.The Star Office is full of bugs, slow and the user interface is ugly."
2,Office?,"Most ""offices"" have email and a calendar. StarOffice 6.0 has neither. StarOffice 5.2 had both. Will Sun remove the word processor from version 7.0?"
1,They are about 5 years away.,I tried this product for five minutes and it crashed five times. It runs like a hog and is worth about 5 cents. So if you like wasting your money go right ahead. Like me you will be right back to Office. :(
2,Absurd to buy unless you use Linux,"My only question would be ""why?"" If you are using a Windows operating system, just go with Microsoft. And if you're using Linux, I'd have to ask ""why?"" as well. If you really want to use Linux, I suppose this is for you. Otherwise, it's a ridiculous purchase. This came for free on a computer I once owned and I deleted it."
1,StarOffice6.0 is the bane of my existance.,"After installing StarOffice on my PC operating under Windows XP, all of my programs were erased and the fan in my computer ceased to work. The reason I know StarOffice is accountable for this mishap is that as I clicked the (FINISHED) button after the installation, the fan immediately stopped and my computer crashed seconds later. Now I can no longer play Diablo 2, I was almost at the end of the game. I say F' StarOffice 6.0."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"Well what can I say? Already been using it to good effect, really has been stable on one SuSE Linux system and one Windows XP system. Indeed one can hardly tell them apart on either system.One big thing that is included is a 460 page manual, a setup guide a support entitlement guide. Binary code license in many different languages. Plus a few more items that I will let you find out.Found some weird Excel spreadsheets that opened fine. Heard some Murmuring that StarOffice 6 had issues with opening some complicated Excel files and documents. I have not run into these myself and wonder if the reviewers were doing something exceptional.All in all a great product!"
2,"NOT ""fully compatible"" !!!!","The spec may say fully MS Office compatible, but it's not. The first file I tried to open was an Excel file that was password protected. Star Office simply told me that it was unable to open the file and had an error that it was uable to rectify. It knew the file had a password but couldn't even open a dialog box asking for a password. A lot of my files are P/W protected and I receive a lot from other people. This program is essentially useless when working with P/W protection."
3,Ok---unless you run on a Network,"Star Office 6.0 works great, as long as you are a stand-alone user. I can't get it to work at all on my Windows 2000 network. It requires that each individual user to their own ""install"" on each computer that they logon to. However, my 400 users are students who swap machines regularly, and do not have permissions to install software. It would cost our school ... to use Star Office, and [a lot] for the MS Office licenses. So, I'm stuck! The Sun Star Office Support Forum has lots of people with similar problems, but no solutions that work. The tech support people in Massachusetts must all be Unix folks---they just don't understand."
3,"Out of date, but worhwhile","This book will seem a little out of date for anyone with a little experience. However, having said that, it is a useful book."
5,A language book that's fun to read! Excellent.,"The Elements of Expression is a rarity--a book on language that's actually fun to read. If you're a words person, you should glom onto this book. Plotnik illustrates expressive writing and conversation with examples from Shakespeare to Don Johnson. There are two especially pithy chapters: ""Grammar and Other Night Sweats"" and ""Make My Day: The Power of Tough Talk."" The book concludes with a witty and original discussion of expressiveness in cyberspace--it's as fresh as today"
2,Two Fatal Flaws,"Reading the great quotations, the thesaurus, or anything else that features vivid expression is valuable advice. It almost makes up for the book's two fatal flaws. First, ""Elements"" is jokey, sophomoric, and superficial in too many places. Second, the book's main prescriptions are neither summarized for ready reference nor linked to any underlying principles of good composition. Strunk & White's ""Elements of Style"" is more systematic and a better choice for my money."
1,Expensive,this is my favorite scent but WHY is it so expensive here??? I can go to Walmart and it will probably be less than $4.
3,In spite of...,... being an old recording it is watchable. It will pixelate in huge screens though. Mine is a 42'' LCD screen.Interviews between songs could've been avoided; they break the rhythm of the concert.The band plays really nice and I recommended it if you are inti this band and general 80's rock.
2,April Wine Live in London,"I was disapointed with the quality of this dvd. The track listings were all of songs that I enjoy, so what was the problem? The picture quality is poor, the quality of the picture I would consider to be poor even for a vhs recording. I played the dvd on a blue ray player which is designed to upconvert dvd's to a better quality of picture, this didn't help. The sound quality on this dvd is also of poor quality (one of the most important aspects to a concert dvd). On the back of the dvd case came this suggestion "" If your system includes 5.1 audio, you should be able to switch the amplifier to activate simulated 5.1 surround sound, to enhance this archive recording."" I would suggest you turn the sound off and play an April Wine record while watching this if you want better sound or maybe a casette tape or 8 track tape."
3,April Wine LIVE!!!,"This is a typical (but great) concert from 28+ years ago.The ""wavey"" videography is a little distracting, but April Winesounds great and the track list couldn't get much better.Overall, 4 stars out of 5."
4,Good enough to search for it,"I remember staying up at night to read this book to my brother when we were kids. It continues the story of Lam Lao, now on a planet where a eugenics policy is being enacted. Of course, it's up to Lam and his new friends (including a love interest) to face impossible odds and beat the bad guys.It's been a LONG time since I've read it, but I remember enjoying it as a kid. If I were to read it again as an adult (as I'm hoping to do), I'm guessing that I would find it a little formulaic/predictable. (The first book in this series--from what I remember--is less so.) Even so, both books stuck in my mind through the years--enough to motivate me to log on and look for them. Surely that counts for something . . ."
5,An excellent chisel set,"I had been shopping for a set and researched the reviews for the PSI and HSS sets. Thanks to the Amazon community for taking the time to share their experiences and impressions. I took a chance on this set because it had no reviews at my time of purchase but I am extremely satisfied by the quality, not only of the chisels, including the steel and handles, but the case, too. I'm finding the chisels hold an edge very well and have great heft, balance and overall feel. All together, it's a great value and I am very, very pleased with the purchase."
1,Worked great for a short while.,"I purchased the GPS V a year and a half ago, worked great, then it quit, could not locate satellites, and now will not even turn on. Called Garmin and was told they would look at it for $150.00 plus shipping. I decided to pass, to rich for my blood, sure am glad I didn't get the Street Pilot!"
4,I like it,"I am very pleased with my GPS V, It replaces an older version and the newer model is great. For the money you can't bet it."
5,Best Purchase for my Car EVER,"I've been using Garmin GPS products for about 10 years. My other GPS, a Garmin GPS-III+ is Great. But when they added routing to this III+ look-a-like I had to try it!I'm in the LA area and have set the GPS V with everything from LA County below Whittier to the ocean, and all of Orange county along the same northern line. This device works GREAT! I went on a driving trip to San Luis Obispo after uploading that area and it took me right to the door! This product is great for travel because it's easy to take with you! And at 20% off I it's a steal!"
4,Economical Way to Navigate,"It has been a very succesful unit for us. We have two cars at home, only extra thing we purchased was a base unit to fix into another car. Every time we need to use this GPS we just manage accordingly in any car.Some time it gives you different names of routes. I guess it because the data has not been updated properly.Memory is limited but good enough for daily use, covering all areas where we usualy travel. Keep in mind we always have an option to add or delete maps according to our needs. I would not recomend this unit for any long distance traveler.For beginers this is the best unit.."
4,Works great until you get CLOSE to destination,"I love this thing. It has shown me different routes through and around the crowded LA metropolitan area and I arrive early. I've done one firmware upgrade and there were no problems. My only complaint is that when you get within a couple of blocks (or freeway exits) the system doesn't seem to know which way to turn fast enough. You have to guess, then turn around if you weren'y lucky. It does have an awesome ""off-route"" auto correction feature! Too bad it can't warn you that you're in a bad area of town!"
3,Garmin GPS V - a lot for the money - unless you have a Macintosh,"The GPS V is a great bargain, but Garmin's lack of support for the Mac is lame. It's also apparent that Garmin is milking the product without doing a few easy things which would bring it up to date and make it great. It's got an outmoded RS-232 9 pin connector rather than USB, which requires BOTH an expensive adapter AND a PC to load the included maps, (unless you have an obsolete PC.) Mac owners, even with Virtual PC are hosed because the adapter won't work. That said, it's a lot of GPS for PC owners who don't mind loading maps, because the limited and not-expandable memory has relatively limited capacity. (I can only fit about half of Colorado in the 19 meg.) I'd love it if I had a PC, but I don't."
4,Very good GPS at its days,"It was a very good GPS with sense reception. It is convenient to use 2 AA batteries. You can buy it anywhere and never will lose power. The only down side is the memory is too small that can save map to cover only certain area. Of course compare with today's GPS, this one is very outdated."
4,Great auto routing GPS for the money,"Overall this is the ideal for factor for me as I use it both on a motorcycle and in cars, , the newer 60c units block my motorcycle dash too much and I really do not care about Color, in fact with the issues of color screens washing out in sunlight I prefer grayscale as they will NEVER wash out, they perform better in direct sunlight. Reason it is 4 vs 5 Stars, EXPANDABLE MEMORY, this unit desperately needs at least 32 MB of ram and honestly they should have allowed for some type of media card (using one of the standard ones not the proprietary stuff). But if this came with 32 standard then I would have probably given it a 5."
1,far too little memory,"19MG of memory barely gets me out of 4 states.I bought this unit as I am travelling from Vegas to Virginia on my own and wanted the security of being able to find places to stop easily and also stay on the path. I'm not called Dorothy and I have never been to Kansas but I plan to and I don't want to have to use magic shoes to find my way home either - but frankly red shoes would be more useful that this unit for cross country travel. I have spent the last couple of hours trying to prune my map so I can download the maps - no hope. Am really frustrated as the salesman knew my purpose and I guess did not know the product. There's no way you can use this unit ""As Is"" for any real trips - to and from work would seem to be ok. I am going to return it and try the streetpilot III delux - wish me luck...."
1,"Too old, too slow","I'll be brief... why would ANYBODY buy this antiquated, discontinued piece of crap when, for the same money or less, you can purchase an up-to-date, fast machine with much more memory. Why do you think Garmin discontinued it? And, speaking of Garmin, if you ever need factory technical support, be prepared to wait up to an hour or longer on hold... and they will tell you that in their message!!!"
2,WAY TOO SMALL!,"I bought this for my mother who does alot of traveling. Unfortunately, the screen is way to small to make this a useful or SAFE product to use in a vehicle. The product does have nice features, but needs a much larger display to be useful."
4,Garmin GPS V Deluxe,"I purchased this GPS unit about a week ago and am very pleased so far. The features that are packed into such a small and light device are unbelievable. You can find individual addresses, businesses, points of interest and streets all over North America. The screen is very bright and easily readable. I gave it a 4 because it only has 19 MG of internal storage space for the very detailed maps, which you can download from the included CD. Other than that, it's a fantastic piece of technology worth getting especcially if you like to travel and hate getting lost."
4,Excellent navigator!,"This is an excellent unit! I had purchased the Garmin V Deluxe package with some trepidation as reviews I had read of it were mixed. But I can honestly recommend it without reservation, having had it and used it for a while now. The quibbles I read about the time recalculating routes once off a planned route don't seem right - given 30 seconds or so, the machine recalibrates and calculates. Battery life is good, and acquisition and lock on to satellites is also excellent. In a battery saving measure, the backlight is turned off by default - I do hate that, but it is a very small problem.The unit is smaller than I had thought, and very light. It easily fits in a coat pocket. I like this unit - if you don't require a color unit, talking directions, or a larger screen, this will fit the bill very, very nicely."
5,You cannot go wrong with Garmin...,"My husband and I have several versions of this product, as it has evolved through the years. It is a very good GPS unit. At work, we often have to use a fancy $5000 professional Trimble model. Many times I have not been able to get a good enough signal and have had to use my personal Garmin instead. I don't know why a product that costs less than 1/10th of the price works better, but it often does."
1,Don't bother...,"Did NOT work! I sprayed directly on the bugs, and they jumped with delight. Especially the grasshoppers; I practically drowned them, and they were still hopping around. Didn't smell bad, so it wasn't offensive in the house. That was a plus...but spend your money on another product."
5,Worth the read,Bought it for gifts after reading it on loan from someone else. Purchased 2 and would highly recommend it to others.
5,Want to read this over and over!,"This book is so incredible. My wife and I have both read this separately and now we are reading together after we put the baby to bed in the evenings and we are learning so much. It has such amazing, inspiring stories that confirm the truth of the gospel in such powerful ways. I recommend this to EVERYONE! It contains so many miracles and examples of how the Lord works in our lives."
5,An absolute classic!,"Who could resist giving this book five stars? (Obviously, not many!) Johnston McCulley presents the first appearance of Zorro throughout the world in this classic novel of old Spanish California. Originally published in 1919 and entitled ""The Curse of Capistrano"", this novel is one of the most adventure-packed stories you're probably ever going to find! If you haven't read this book, you should!!!"
2,Misses the Mark,"The book, which is a reprint of the original story of Zorro, is fun and entertaining in a young adult way. The surprise is lost, of course, because I knew that Vega was Zorro. My main complaint is the number of typographical errors, which were rampant throughout the book. As a reader, it brought me to a complete halt while I puzzled out which word it was supposed to be, or who was actually speaking. The editors must have been asleep to produce such sloppy work."
1,The worst audiobook ever!,"This is the worst audiobook ever. I thought that I would have one of my favorite books on audio. I was looking forward to it. Then, to receive an audiobook read by ""Anais 9000,"" a computer, I was angry. Only a cyborg would enjoy this product, and I'm not certain of that! I suggest that you read the book out loud to yourself if you want an audio experience, because this is definitely not it!"
2,Absolute drivel from beginning to end,"The idea of Zorro is interesting, after all, he's the origin of the concept of a secret identity, ala Clark Kent. The bare-bones plot, the puerile formula writing, the romantic treatment of California's feudal past. All of that came out of the tradition of Ramona (check Wikipedia) and none of it is worthy of any of your time."
5,That's the one,"If you are a fan of the original Zorro and you really want to know how everything started, you're going to love this book. The pace, the thrilling suspense that is created from the beggining, it's just awesome."
5,Este es el mejor disco de rancheras de Lucero,"En verdad que Lucero sorprendió con este disco grabado completamente en vivo en su concierto de la Plaza de Toros México, las canciones que incluye el disco son clásicas dentro de la música mexicana de autores tan conocidos como José Alfredo Jiménez, Juan Gabriel y Rubén Fuentes. Además el tema ""Y Volveré"" suena genial con su voz, ""Llorar"" de Joan Sebastian es una de mis favoritas y otras que están muy buenas son ""Se me olvidó otra vez"" y el Popurrí de Juan Gabriel en los que la guapa cantante logra la perfección musical... Este disco lo recomiendo acompañado de amigos y unas cervezas para que llegue aún más al corazón"
2,Luz went out on Lucero,"I enjoy listening to this unique talent, but I was taken aback when she spent a lot of precious time talking, and then the audience became part of the ""talent"" by singing some of the songs. I didn't pay to hear the audience and it spoiled my listening pleasure on some songs, although the ones she sang were excellent."
1,accel coil,my son was travleing the interstate running 70+ when the engine died. he managed to get it stopped and after a few trys got it cranked. took it to a service center today and learned the cap had cracked. mechanic said from the coil. nice looking setup but i recommend staying with the tried and true factory parts. could have been real bad. no harm no foul. just money he didn't have to spend again
5,Tuck this book in your backpack,"I think this book was sad, happy, mixed feelings. I like the part where Helen told Friar Tuck Golden Boy and her life.I liked the book also because the author seemed like this was what happend to him or his sister. I also liked it because Helen was brave to see a dog that she had for a long time going blind.Morley"
5,A good fiction story about a blind dog,"A very good story about a blind dog that gets a guide dog of his own. This was actually the first book I ever read about either a blind dog or a guide dog so at the time I read this book, it was especially interesting for me. This book focuses on the challenge of a blind dog as well as how the dog adapts to having a guide dog. This book is perfect for dog lovers of all ages."
3,None,that was great. i was almost in tears. that is what i call a classic animal story. i want to curl up by the fire and read it again.
4,If you like sad stories read this,The book I read was The Trouble with Tuck by Theodore Taylor. It is about a dog that goes blind. I think the book relates to liberty. Helen has Liberty because she had a good idea and she used it when nobody else thought it would work. I liked this book because it was interesting.By N.S.
1,Puker up for Tucker,"Dear Amazon, (Boo! Boo!)I think this book is so, so stupid! It gives ""Old Yeller"" a bad name! The plot is trash! I mean, come on! A dog who goes blind and then is trained by this girl um.. what's her name? Oh ya! Helen! A dog who goes blind and then is trained by Helen to be led by this Lady Daisy. And about this Lady Daisy, she acts like nothing going on that's exiting enough for her. Get with the program! If I were Daisy I'd bite Tuck's tail off if he snarled at me like that! I really didn't like this book (really).Your Cridic,Zac Man"
3,SEEING EYE GIRL,"In this touching story 13-year-old Helen dedicates months of frustation and hope to resolve a canine crisis: her beloved 3-year-old lab, Friar Tuck, is going blind. As the various ""solutions"" proposed by caring and intelligent adults all prove unacceptable to this desperate young lady, shequietly decides to defy the System. Her goal: to keep her loyal companion alive, at home and free-roaming.Based on an actual incident in California, this story reaches across generations and lovers of pets species, to remind us of the meaning of loyalty, devotion and creative conflict resolution--even tough love. You don't have to be a dog lover to appreciate Helen's pain, or applaud her defiance of grim reality. ""It's never been done before,"" is no excuse! When the principals involved truly have Heart, there Is a way after all. For kids 10-15 and pet lovers of all ages."
5,This is the Best Book Ever!,"The book I read was The Trouble with Tuck by Theodore Taylor. It is about a dog that is going blind named Tuck. The vet has many options of what to do with Tuck. But Helen, the girl, doesn&#65533;t like any of them. So she comes up with her own idea. Will it work? The book didn&#65533;t display truth when Helen lied to her parents. I liked this book because it shows you that you can do things your own way.By C.H."
4,Nice jointer overall.,"Picked up this jointer about a week or so ago. Assemblywas easy enough, and the packaging was very good. Fit andfinish is excellent, and once I got the knives adjustedproperly(which took me forever the first time out) Iwas making nice, clean cuts. This is a really nice jointerfor the $$.Dust collection was also quite good, and my straight edgeand feeler gauges show no more than +-0.003 deviationin any direction across the tables and fence: well withinacceptable tolerances. So far I am very pleased!"
5,Gotta love it,"I'm very happy with this jointer. I'll be retiring an old Craftsman machine now! The Jet went together fairly easily and didn't need any major adjustments. It cuts very smoothly and can handle the hardest wood I've run over it. The length of board it can handle is limited by the bed length, but I don't build a lot of furniture that requires pieces longer than 4 or 5 feet."
4,JET JJ-6CSX Jointer - Good value,"I think this is a good value for the price. I compared this model with Delta, and couldn't justify the additional cost for the Delta. If you do woodworking for a living, you'll probably want something better, but for the serious woodworker/hobbyist, I think this is a good product and I wouldn't go with anything cheaper. I've used mine regularly for about four months. A few things I've found: using a vacuum/dust collector is a almost a necessity as chips accumulate quickly. If you don't, you'll at least need to clean the chip chute frequently. Setting up the outfeed table and blades can take quite awhile (depending on how much of a perfectionist you are), but once I got it set, I've had no problem. I give it four stars because although I've been woodworking for a long time and have done my research, this is my first jointer, so I don't have first hand experience with other products to compare this one to. Product shipment and delivery was quick and professional."
4,Does what it's supposed to,Only took a couple hours to set up (have someone help you place the top on). Adjusted the outfeed table in 5 minutes. Worked great! I like the handwheels (nice touch). Didn't give it 5 stars because I haven't had to deal with customer service. Don't know how that would go.
4,"JJ-CSX 6"" Woodworking Jointer",All cast iron was ground flat out of the box - well within the tolerances that any professional would want. There have been no issues with green castings warping over time. The motor has more than enough power to help the knives plow through the hardest woods. I would never consider a mobile stand for a unit like this. This should be bolted to the floor. One of the best tools I own.
1,Stupid is and understatement,"If you love poor acting, poor directing, and poor photography, then please get this movie. This has to be the dumbest movie I've ever seen in my life. Actors were really poor actors. Even the dead bodies didn't know how to play dead right. The funny part was when the guy got beat up and knocked out by a lady with a little bit of tree bark. Two thumbs down on this one. Wasn't worth the time to film."
3,One Drawback,"The Smead file folders with the reinforced tab are just okay.The pro of the reinforced tab is that it holds up better in the drawer and/or with use.The con is that the reinforcement is created with an extra folded down section along the top of one side of the folder and this ""fold-over"" effect is not securely held down with adhesive on every file folder. This means that your papers can get snagged or caught under that fold and may crumple or rip if you don't pull them out carefully. Since I only have one box I don't know if this problem is batch specific or an issue with the folders overall.So if you just need some folders to hold papers and you don't have any issue with them sometimes getting a little bent as they come out, they're fine but I'd rather have a box of folders where I don't have to worry about whether or not my papers are going to get caught coming out of the folder."
1,Wasted my time and a bunch of labels; plus they're flimsy!,"As one of those people who ""thumb through"" my folders, I like the reinforcement along the top 1"" edge of these folders. It keeps the folders standing up straight, for better visibility.But these folders....I've never seen such a mess. I thought I was imagining things when I noticed they weren't sitting uniformly in my folders. Now that I take them all out and look at them from several angles, I see that these folders are not all the same height! In fact, only one third of them are all the same height. The rest are within a 1/4 inch of each other up or town.Two folders are very roughly cut, which might indicate the ""cutter"" was off on the assembly line. Or they haven't gotten all the kinks worked out for this product.As it is, I've wasted a sheet of labels and must re-start a tedious job. I will give away these folders, as they are unusable for my purposes.Even if they hadn't been defective, I was shocked by how flimsy the paper is."
3,Average,"These are pretty much your average file folder, although the expansion feature is nice. The reinforced tab means they are somewhat more sturdy with respect to the tab folding over, but not much---enough use and pressure will cause these tabs to fold, as well. But what difference does it make, the tabs can always be righted again! I would not find this folder worth a premium price (and I prefer the five-tab vs three-tab variety). The reinforced tab also makes it difficult to turn the folder inside-out for reuse, which I commonly do as a cost-saving and recycling measure."
4,longer lasting tabs,"The reinforced tabs on these file folders are just enough stronger that I expect them to last longer than the ones I normally use. Can't say for sure that they will, but it seems logical to expect it."
4,The end of dog-eared tabs?,"A manila folder is a manila folder, if it's sitting in a redweld or other file where it has a buffer zone, or if it's not being handled much. Folders that need a lot of handling tend to ""give"" first at the tabs, which results in a file that is hard to read (and quickly locate the right folder) from the top of a box or drawer.Certainly not the biggest problem in the world, but if it is something that bothers you, this product's reinforced tabs are designed to answer it. Good quality folders."
4,"Excellent, 'standard' 3 tab folders from Smead ~ great product!","Excellent, Smead file folders - letter size, 1/3 cut tab, 100 per box: what a great product! A standard, reinforced tab folder: plenty of room for writing info on the tab (and it's thick and reinforced - very nice)...these are highly recommended for filing, carrying papers, etc. There are certain office products that you get used to, and then never want to do without again, and for me, good, solid 1/3 cut tab file folders are one of those products: always handy to have around, always can find a hundred uses for them...would definitely recommend a box of these!"
4,I use these a lot.,"Thanks, I use these a lot. With the end of the year coming, I will go through several of these file folders, and they work very well. The reinforced tab and the fact that they are slightly taller than most folders makes them much more user friendly."
5,Absolutely wonderful.,"I bought this book in order to be able to write my senior high school history paper on the extent to which the public opinions of WWI were reflected in the songs written and sung in France during that time. Needless to say, this book was the only thing that made that paper possible. I couldn't have asked for a more well-researched, well-supported book, that was not only informative, but also written in a way which kept it interesting. I only wish I could have spent more time with it, instead of racing through so as to finish my paper by the deadline. A highly recommended read to anyone."
3,Good for what it is,This book is most certainly good for what it is meant to be. It provides primary texts with a minimal amount of analysis. I am reading this for a college course on Heresy and Dissent in Medieval Europe and it provides the basis for the entire class.
3,Jammin' away,"The kids loved the guitar, but it was enough to drive the adults insane. Anytime you touch something on the plastic guitar, the toy belts out a long, seemingly never-ending riff.This toy is only for people with deaf parents.The guitar plays its own songs - with very little involvement from the kids. It was fun for 20 minutes."
1,Truly Dissappointed,I just received this item after ordering it for my nephew's birthday. I was so dissappointed. It is so tiny and cheap looking and I am embarrassed to give it as a gift.
3,Wrong picture/product,"Just note, the picture is for Sense of Peace tea, but the product is Double Vanilla tea tins. The product that comes is double vanilla."
4,Thoroughly researched book on Catholic Churches,"Michael Rose has done it again. His book pointed out with lazer accuracy how much our Catholic churches have devolved from architecturally sound and glorious edifices to the banal, uninspiring structures they are today.For those interested, a wonderful read.Rose marie Ezatoff"
3,some interesting material,"I found a lot of what Michael Rose had to say rather interesting. I've found that most found modern Catholic churches aren't very beautiful, so I aggreed with a lot he had to say. But he obviously had an axe to grind and it was apparent on every page. It sometimes tainted the message, I thought. My biggest complaint was with the photographs. Most of the captions are completely unoriginal, just excerpts from the text. Less than a quarter of the photographs had captions that explained exactly what the picture showed, which church it was, etc. It wasn't until I leafed through to the end that I discovered a photo credits appendix. Why the photo credits couldn't be on the same page as the photos themselves is beyond me. I was also frustrated when he would mention a particluarly ugly church but not provide a picture of it. I had to go online to find photos of some of the churches he talked about, just so his comments made sense."
1,Uglier than Sin,"This book is, quite frankly, trash. Someone needs to read the Bible. Are the examples carefully chosen to show ugly buildings? Yes, of course. But the theology of architecture is both biased, and sinful. Zero stars?"
2,self feed bits,"I ORDERED THIS BIT KIT BECAUSE IT WAS ADVERTISED AS A TWO CUTTING EDGE DRILL BIT. I HAVE A DEWALT 1 3/8 TWO EDGED BIT AND IT WORKS GREAT, SO I WAS INTERESTED IN GETTING A KIT[I AM A CONTRACTOR] BUT WHEN I RECEIVED MY KIT AND OPENED IT, I SAW IT WAS NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER SELF FEED DRILL BIT WITH ONE CUTTING EDGE. I DONT KNOW IF I GOT THE WRONG KIT BY MISTAKE OR NOT, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT, BECAUSE I AM STILL INTERESTED IN GETTING WHAT I ORIGINALLY ORDERED."
5,A New Folk?,"XM Radio has a channel, XMU, devoted to what it calls ""What's Next,"" and among its alternative music forms, it says it plays ""down-tempo,"" usually self-indulgent, adolescent Emo with weak or incompetent drummers. Private Eleanor is not ""down-tempo."" Yes, their individuated, complex weave of acoustic and electric rhetorics is much closer to the intelligence of chamber music than to, uh, stadium rock. This is a new folk music, though, with the interiority of medieval love poetry, the vocal graces of early 1950's duets (like Les Paul & Mary Ford), and the smart kinetics of serious rock. The best thing about such hybrid bands as Private Eleanor - like Neutral Milk Hotel, Iron & Wine, or Rilo Kiley - is the positive, proactive, radical difference in their sounds. Private Eleanor celebrates a radiating solitariness, emotionally, and it's hard to stop listening to it, especially when it matches your own mood... great music can do that..."
1,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately, there is not a lot of information about this item on other websites. I bought this item because I have an angled ceiling with a steep angle. I own a Hunter brand ceiling fan so I bought this Hunter brand ceiling mount thinking it would attach nicely to the existing equipment that came with the hunter fan. This is a stand alone mount, it does not fit with any of the hunter fan stock equipment. You are also expected to drill your own hole to utilize this. It doesn't have any brackets to fit into your existing electrical equipment."
4,Pointed Drills Excellent,The drills are excellent but getting them in and out of the case is a chore. Best use gloves. RHF
4,having the right size at the right time,My first assortment of bits in various sizes for my dewalt drill. So far so good....
3,Not a Bad Drill Bit Set,"Good assortment. One thing about this set, I have yet to have a bit break. Problem is, they do not hold their edge very long. I drill into hard antler sheds and some hard dead woods. Bits are great when new, but quickly start to lose the sharp edge. Expected better from DeWalt. Will probably buy Dewalt again, but will go 1 grade better."
3,A bit rough,The condition of this book is really a bit rough. If I had seen this copy at a 2nd hand store I wouldn't have bought it. I am concerned that it will fall apart with not much use.
2,Good Quality but..............,This is my first Mp3 player but I am dissappointed. After dropping accidently 2 times the radio doesn't work and the order of songs is wacked. The sound quality is good but the backlight is annoying and the led screen doesn't always display the correct info from windows Media Player. The SD card doesn't even notice 1/4 of the songs I Put in and I am unhappy.
2,Broken player,"Initally, I enjoyed using this player but after a month orso the player wouldn't work. I reloaded the firmware as directedby on-line support without success. The player turns itself off rather than playing the selected file. Now what?"
2,ONLY IF NO OTHER OPTION AVAILABLE!,This is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Headphones. These are very light and cheap feeling. The sound quality is poor and not very loud at all. I could only reccomend these if there were no other options. Spend a few more dollars and pickup something better.P.sBe carefull who you buy from and read feedback of the sellers because some are very sensitive about the rating you give them. A 5 star would be for over the top service. Some think they should get a 5 star for just being them. I would look for another headset other than these or head to your local dollar store and pickup the same thing without the shipping fee.
2,Lightlid 35 is pathetic!,"I needed to scan many slides to make a DVD for my parent's anniversary. My brother gave me his Lightlid 35 and Microtek scanner (not X6). The Lightlid barely did what I needed it to. It's a piece of junk. However, it seemed I couldn't touch any other slide scanner for less than a few hundred dollars. Anyway, if you don't need perfect scans of slides, this Lightlid is for you. Beware, forget scanning slides that are too light or too dark, it can't read them."
5,Very high quality tools.,"I LOVE these allen wrenches. I use them for all sorts of things, but mainly to work on guitars & music equipment. They are very well made, and the ball ends are a nice touch and work well. After almost a year of use they still look brand new."
5,Superb,"Superb, profound and highly enjoyable book on the life of the Buddha. It's a truly amazing piece of work.....and will greatly strengthen your spirituality."
3,fanciful historical novel,"This makes the history of the Buddha seem real, which may or may not be a good thing for those who wish to know the most archeologically valid information. Since there is no actual historical information, it seems perhaps inappropriate to just make it up and give the impression that the life at the time was in some way similar to our own. This reads like a good Harry Potter novel. If the reader wishes to know how to Do Buddhism then consider Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book.Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book: Introduction to Rational Buddhism"
2,Rice & sesame salt,"Do not buy this book unless it's to read as a bedtime story to the under 9 set that you are trying to raise as Buddhists. It's sickenly sweet, unbearably redundant, and very shallow (there's little that can be considered remotely deep Buddhist thought). Sidhartha sits and meditates and becomes enlightened, then he goes from town to town where people offer him rice with sesame salt and hundreds upon hundreds of people instantly convert to Buddhism after he says ""nothing is permanent & everything is interconnected."" That's about it, page after page after page. This is my third book I've read by Hanh & I just don't get his popularity."
5,The Buddha's life beautifully retold,"Thich Nhat Hanh's very simple and very lovely retelling of the Buddha's life is almost a requirement for the library of any Buddhist - or of anyone else interested in a life of spirituality, peace, and compassion.A book which may be read a little at a time to calm and restore the spirit. Would make an especially wonderful gift!"
5,For years I've looked past it.,"Of all the books I've read on Buddhaism, Zen, Taoism, etc., the simple, gentle and well told stories in this book has had the most impact on me.Hanh speaks of thoughtfulness in the book, while the book itself elicits thoughtfulness. For me, reading this book brought to mind the similarities of other ""teachers"" found in other religions and philosophies.I found it hard to put this book down, yet very easy to pick it up to reread it. If you know someone who is searching for an identity or purpose in life, share with them this book."
1,Only half the book!,"The content of the book is fine, this review is on the product Amazon is selling, which is only the first of a two volume series. And they do not sell the second volume at all.I would have liked to have contacted Amazon about this, but they make the feedback process so that my choices are to leave a review or give packaging feedback.Boo!"
5,Perfect Fit,"Hey, it's a DashMat. What else could I write? It fits perfect, and the color matches just as I knew it would. It sure looks great in my 2001 Chevy Silverado 2500HD."
3,"My first Eileen Dryer book, but it won't be my last","This is my first book of Eileen Dryer. I loved it. I couldn't put it down. I picked it up because Eileen Dreyer was compared to Tess Gerritsen, one of my favorities. My only complaint is that the author slips and twice calls the main character Maggie, not Molly. I'd understand if it is a minor character, but not the main one. A proof reader should have caught that."
2,Page Turner? No Way!,I will keep this brief. I had trouble getting through this book. I could only get through a chapter at a time before dozing. There just wasn't enough action. There were too many long stretches of boredom. The only reason I give it 2 stars is that it got half decent after I was about 2/3 of the way through it. If you want a page turner about serial killers then try The Hour Game by David Baldacci.
4,"Not really King Kobra, but not bad","This album was essentially the Appice/Keeling band released under the name King Kobra because the Label wouldn't finance it unless there was a brand name attached to it. This is one of the many travesties that record companies put their artist through to make a buck because this music clearly wasn't written to be a part of a King Kobra album most of these songs appeared in a little known film ""Chasing Destiny"" starring Casper Van Dien, Lauren Graham, & Christopher Lloyd. Both Carmine and Kelly appeared in the movie as well. The song Jessy was written for the Lauren Graham's character ""Jessy James"" So if you can listen to this for what it is and not what it's labeled for (King Kobra) you may actually enjoy it. The name is just some legal BS that they needed to put this out back then. The production is top notch and I never heard Mick Sweda play better! It's NOT King Kobra but it's not bad either!"
1,WHY DID THEY BOTHER?,"This is absolutely terrible. Bad production. Awful awful awful!! They actually re-recorded ""Ready To Strike"" and butchered it. Stick with the first 2 albums - ""Ready To Strike"" and ""Thrill Of A Lifetime"". Even ""King Kobra III"" if you can find it. I wonder if they even listened to this before it was released? Any of them. The band? The record company? I was very disappointed to say the least."
4,Has problems with Win XP,"The drivers for the USB card programmer, which you WILL want to use do not support Windows XP. This can be solved by going to the Garmin web site and downloading the updated driver, but you have to either figure this out for yourself, or read this review.<G>If you also get the MapSource update, the ""Save to"" dialog has changed, and you must pick the USB card programmer from the FILE|SAVE TO menu, or from the dropdown next to the icon. The tab dialog shown in the documentation is gone.The updates can be found at http://www.garmin.com/support/download.jspOther than the software installation problems on XP, the unit is GREAT. In fact two friends who have seen it are going to buy it, and another is thinking about it.Now, I can once again carry a passenger in the front seat, and leave my laptop in its case."
2,Close but no cigar,"Just bought the StreetPilot III Deluxe package and returned it after just one day. The product is not ready for prime time because it is slow, has a sloppy interface and poor user manuals. The software finally installed under Windows 98 after a couple of lengthy tries and crashes. Programming the flash card with 128MB of data was a pain -- lousy MapSource interface and very slow data transfers for USB (45 minutes for 128MB). And even with 128 MB, you cannot get in all the data for a trip from NY to Florida. Screen redraws are slow as you are driving. Also, because this is not WAAS enabled, the accuracy is down to only 15 meters and this makes spoken directions on tight turns a little inaccurate. Entering an address to go to is clunky. Magellan's user interface is much better. I recommend the Magellan Roadmate 700 even though it is twice the price."
5,Delivers all as promised,Once set up it is simple to use. Ability to use an address to enter a waypoint is really a plus. Impossible to go off route as it gives instant corrections.
2,Hopelessly underpowered,"GPS systems are great! This one, however, is hopelesslyunderpowered. Its processor tends to be busy updatingthe display when you need it the most. If you miss aturn because of that, it notices - once it finishedupdating the display - that you are ""off route"". Thesubsequent search for a new route may easily take 30+seconds, and once it is finished, guess what. Youprobably took a wrong turn again. So it startssearching again. Get the picture? The unit is terrificif you are brave (and patient) enough to stop and waitwhenever it is busy. I didn't have the guts to stop onhighways, but at places with few roads I found the unitto be really helpful. Too bad the manufacturer didn'tspend the additional 5 bucks to equip the unit with areasonable CPU."
4,Mac users can now use this GPS,"Previous comments lamented the lack of Mac software to download maps to the Street Pilot. There is now a Mac software solution called GPSy <http://www.gpsy.com/features.html> that works with this GPS and many other types.Excellent GPS with advanced features; only 4 stars for 1) moderately complex interface and nonintuative destination programming, and 2) making Mac users pay for an extra map-download program on a $600 product."
2,Second unit died,"I just found out that my friends SPIII deluxe unit died one week before mine went on the fritz. Both units were ~20 months old. Mine is ignoring key inputs. His died by failing to power up despite the choice of power source. The only consolation is that Garmin is willing to fix them for $225 each. At this point, one has to wonder if shelling out the 225, plus $150 for the v6 map upgrade is better than getting a new unit (either WAAS enabled Magellan RM700 or a Garmin 2620) for ~$940. Seeing the two units die so close to each other in time is a bad testament to the product design. Hopefully the new designs of the last 6 months will be better. SPIII is a design from a few years ago."
3,Screen bug-a-boo,"My Garmin 2610 has long been a terrific electronic unit. Now, for no known reason, the screen has shifted to the point where the touch does not allow you to enter text. Garmin wants $250 to fix the unit regardless of the issue. I think this is excessive for a unit that has been immaculately cared for and is quite expensive. Magellan next time for me..."
2,Processer hopelessly slow,"GPS systems are great! This one, however, is hopelesslyunderpowered. Frequently, when needing directions, thesystem was busy refreshing its graphical display.So I had to take a guess. When the guess was wrong, thesystem would realize I am ""off route"" and start searchingfor a new route. During this time (20 sec??), I would likelyfail to anticipate the correct route - so when thesuper-slow search algorithm finally returned with a route,it immediately realized I was off route again. And again.You get the picture? It's painful to purchase a unit forserious money just to find out that the manufacturer saves [money] on a decent microprocessor.It's a great unit for patient people (and people who arebrave enough to stop on highways!). When its screen isupdated, it gives great advice!"
1,Out of date,"This is an out of date GPS that has been discontinued by Garmin.I had a lot of problems downloading the driver into my notebook and desktop (both running Windows xp). I had to try several times (I am computer savvy). The memory card that came with unit was defective, I had to get a new one from Garmin, and you can easily damage it. You have to use their 12th century card reader to plug to your pc to download the software to the unit. You cannot hook the unit directly to your pc (unless you have an old serial port-male)The memory card (128mb) can only hold so much map data. While the LCD has an excellent resolution (that's why I am giving a one star rating), it will take you some time before you can learn all the features of the units and the map source.To sum things up, stay away from this gps, invest a few more hundreds and get a newer version."
1,save your money,What a waste. It is unreadable during the day. Support takes too long to get back to you and it is unuser friendly.
3,Very high level of details,"Goog book, but you have treat it as the entry level for the subject of call center benchmarking. You will not find the detailed information but, as the trade off, it's presenting a comprehensive overview of the subject. So can be used as a guidline for your activities in this area."
3,Hand truck,Have not yet used this item. It appears to be what we need here at home. I like flexibility and light weight.
4,CENTERPIECE OF OUR SHOP...,"This was the second JET product we purchased (after the vac) and we have been extremely pleased with it. In our shop, it is used on a daily basis and with the exception of POOR DUST CONTROL, it is a delight to use. Changing blades, adding the resaw equipment is as simple as just taking the time to do it without requiring repetive or bizzare adjustments. We have added an after market table top to increase it's size and provide a fence that is more precise... but day after day, we find it the easiest power tool in the shop to use..."
4,Super value for a great tool,"I purchased this tool with the 6"" riser block. The quality of manufacturing is great. I found no problems with the saw when I unpacked it and assemly was a breeze.This saw is very solidly made, cast iron. I LOVE the fence. Blade tracking is true. The blade does not wander while cutting. Dust collection is not very effective but this seems to be a common problem on most bandsaws.After using this saw for approx. 1 year, the only thing I would change is the motor. Although it comes with a 1HP motor, it has some trouble when resawing hardwoods. It does the job but not without struggling a little."
3,Jet is knocked out by Rikon,"Band saw is very important for some woodworking styles. Thus, I do rip on band saw a lot, since it is much safer than table saw for small pieces. I also like curves which are not composed from circles. I make tenon and dovetails on band saw.So, I have got this saw (not from Amazon), sold it, and bought Rikon 14"" deluxe version.Let's compare1. Rikon can resaw 12"", no riser block kit needed.2. Rikon has 20x16"" table, no aftermarket table needed.3. Rikon has much more advanced guides.4. Rikon has 1-1/2"" HP motor5. Rikon does not vibrate at all6. Most important point, Rikon can properly tension 3/4"" carbide blades7. Finally, Rikon has absolutely terrific customary service (have not seen better).Rikon is $750, Jet band saw plus all after market items to match only some specification of Rikon is >$900. So, Rikon 14"" saw will knock out Jet band saw in a minute. Delta band saw in a second."
4,still working strong,"I have had the Jet bandsaw for over a year. I have used to resaw 2x4 pine boards to build a fence. It has done well to resaw hardwoods such a oak and birch. It has all the power needed to resaw a 6"" oak board. I also make boxes which I cut curves in a 6"" thick piece of hardwood with no problems. I would recommend spending the extra money to get the 1 hp motor instead of the 3/4 hp. The guides adjust quickly and the blade tracks well. The only problem I have had is the blade tensioner broke after approximately 6 months. Jet quickly sent a new part and it was easy to replace. I have been very happy with this product and I use it all the time."
4,Great Woodworkers Toy!,"This is one great unit for the money, and was extremely fast and easy to assemble right out of the cartons. One feature that was noticed as soon as I turned it on was the limited vibration. The only concern I have is the use of graphite guide blocks. The bandsaw I owned before purchasing the Jet used roller guides, which worked pretty well. Time will tell, but if needed, I can always change them out."
5,This is the real thing!,As we all know this has been a hard to find parfum for quite some time. I got mine in the mail today. I have tested it and it IS the original scent and has lasted for hours already. This price is amazing. I am buying more ASAP! Thanks!
5,Great,"I can't believe I didn't get these sooner. It makes drilling big holes so much easier than alternative methods.Maybe it's common knowledge, but I've found that if you drill a 1/8"" pilot hole first it works faster and I have almost zero problems with the screw getting ""gummed up"" in pressure treated wood."
5,vetri-disc,i have a miniature dachshund that i do agility with and the vet suggested i put her on vetri-disc to protect her back and so far she has shown no problems at all with doing the agility. I love it.
3,sexual abuse victim's journey to recovery and healing,"After reading this book, there will be no doubt in the reader's mind what Erin went through. The author writes about her feelings in detail and does so repeatedly. It's a sad account of a little girl's childhood irreparably broken at the hands of a family member. The book could have been better edited as there are a lot of mistakes. Of course, anyone can read this book but the writing style is that of an adolescent and would be a great read especially for pre-teens and young adults."
2,Stolen Innocence,"This story is really sad and it could have been a good book. but the writer is a terrible one. There was so many mistakes and the way she writes is boring. I understand she is trying to make it look like a 6th grader wrote it (she did a great job at that!) but lets get real, does anyone want to read 248 pages of a 6th grader repeating herself over and over again?i was excited to get this book from reading all of the good reviews but i would only recommend this to a 6th grader going through the recovery of incest that she was.I hope nobody over the age of 13 wastes their money on this book."
5,Carlos in Top Form,"Carlos outdoes himself on this one. His guitar playing is bone chilling. Now That You Know,Bella, Blues for Salvador, and Trane really display Carlos Santana genius as a guitarist. Most of this cd is instrumental rock,featuring Santana's vintage guitar solos as only he can do them.This cd won a the grammy award for best instrumental rock album of 1987. I own numerous Santana CD's and this one is one of my favorites."
5,Some of the best of Carlos.,"The whole Santana band is on this, but it also includes some unbelievable cuts including Tony Williams, etc. Great stuff! Lots of instrumental greatness, including an amazing duet between Carlos and keyboardist Chester Thompson."
2,for 80's synth pop & drum machine fans,"The 80's synth pop keyboards and drums on this album are so annoying that I just couldnt go thru with a 2nd listen. Is this Santana or Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode? This album is a collection of studio and live songs which sound like left-overs from his 80's albums... which some tracks really are.Only tracks #2, 4, 8 are worth your time and money.As such 80's synth pop are way too dated here. We dont need a Jan Hammer or Herbie Hancock sound on a Santana album. [...]."
3,Not Quite Essential But Certainly Creative,"On Blues For Salvador, Carlos Santana explores a somewhat softer more R&B flavor sound. There is a lesser latin influence here but none the less these delightful sounds do creep up from time to time. This effort is almost exclusively an instrumental, as whatever vocals do exist are used more to emphasize the use of the human voice as a supporting instrument rather than as a dominant force. The songs themselves are not as catchy as on Supernatural, Abraxas, or Santana 3 but certainly have their captivating moments. The opening number, Bailando/Aquatic Park is a definite highlight as is the energetic Trane. Bella has some touching instrumentation as Carlos and Chester Thompson blend quite nicely together. Some of the other pieces lack a strong central melody. However, just the presence of Carlos's guitar make this a release that can be appreciated."
3,Interesting,"We all know Santana best from the classics, 'Oye Como Va' and 'Evil Ways'. This late 80's release by Carlos Santana takes the listener in a whole 'nother direction. The title of this review says it for me as far as this CD goes. Interesting. In a good way of course"
2,"Managers can skim for value, but probably not worth the time","While there's definitely some value in the things he says about the relationships between work environment and client respect, it was hard to say that his use of statistics matched what I remember from college. It would've been worth either eliding the high-level use of statistics entirely or just subjugating larger sections on the correlations and significance to a detailed appendix -- like papers on new type systems, people want to know that the semantics are sound in detail, but don't necessarily want to see every proof of every lemma interspersed with the text.Additionally, it wasn't clear how to turn this into anything other than personal action items. It was easy to understand that you should change things in your company, but there wasn't a ton of advice around how to actually make the changes suggested."
4,The Resident Assistant: working with college students,"I used this book for an assignment in completing my masters degree in Student Development. I thought it was comprehensive and very informative, both for the RA and the residence life professional. A good blend of theory and practical pointers from understanding students to program planning. This would be a good resource for anyone wanting to work in a residence hall."
3,The Resident Assistant,"It looks like this book is out of print, which is too bad. It is rare to find a book written for RA's. Although universities usually have extensive training programs for their Resident Assistant's, I found this book helpful to supplement my own training and information."
4,Perfect for fine detail,"Derwent's thin, hard-cored pencils which are great for botanical paintings and fine, detailed work.Derwent say that these have the same pigment cores as the Artists range but in a finer, crisper, more precise delivery.They come in 72 colours and I have to say this, in the interest of fairness, they are not the most lightfast pencils you could buy. Some 8s, but a lot of 4s even in the darker side, and a lot of 1s especially in the light pinks, violets, yellows...be warned.The Studio line is hexagonal barrelled giving you a better grip, which you'll need as these hard, fine pencils are great for detailed work. For a hard pencil, they are surprisingly creamy and smooth, especially over cold-press support. It's almost linear, the surface, which makes covering it a little hard work. But a few layers of these Studio pencils and I got a lovely warm cover of beautiful colour. I can say that the Studio pencils blend seamlessly. I got a smooth and warm transition of colours."
2,Make desktop databases not with this book.,"I purchased this book as it looked like it had lots of database programming information contained within it, especially as the author had included a full working example.On closer inspection, I was very disappointed the example/tutorial application was not concise and was not fully functional.The book content is 50% rubbish to be nice, I mean, why have comparisons with other tools and languages etc. Delphi users know why they bought the product, but now they want to get down to the nitty gritty of where, how, why.The reference section is way to long and tries to touch on subjects other authors have based whole books upon.Other than that, the author covers CS fairly well.Oh and the CD example apps didn't work either. END"
1,great at first...but BEWARE danger Will Robinson,"bought this Jan 2012 (target). Loved this heater at first. Brought it out this Nov 2012 and the temperature sky rockets past what its set at. And yes I know how to work the controls, I know not to use an extension cord, and I know to keep space around it. (why do other reviews chalk up this problem/hazard to user error - really?) Last year I set it and walked away. Now, I am too afraid to use it and will trash it. Which is pitiful to spend $60 and only have used it for 4months. Doesn't anyone make a product that works or stand by it when it becomes a safety issue?"
1,BEWARE of burning plastic smell!,I have owned this heater several years and was very impressed how well it heats up a small to medium size room. The digital display is a little confusing with the numerous settings and limited display but it works well.Aside from that I wanted to write this review to indicate the unit can be a fire hazard. Be warned I woke up to my apartment smelling like burning plastic and had a splitting headache. I had the heater placed near the center of the room with nothing around. I understand I have had this heater for a decent amount of time but numerous other owners on Amazon have indicated a similar problem from burnt outlets to a burning plastic smell. To me this is unacceptable because it's not worth the risk of a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning no matter how long you have the product.
3,So sad it broke!,"We loved ours! A lot of the people who are having problems with it shutting itself off randomly are probably playing with the middle button on the unit - it is some kind of timer. We never used it, but realized when we had the same problem.Our problem is that the oil pan must have burst or something - I came into the kitchen one day and there was a brown puddle on the floor and the thermostat was registering 90 degrees. So thankful it didn't catch on fire or anything, but if it hadn't been on linoleum it would have left a nasty mess on the carpet. Returned it to the store no problem, but we were unable to replace it with the same model as it was not in stock."
1,Unreliable at best.,"I purchased this radiator at Target and it worked ok for about a month. After that the temperature setting malfunctioned and it wouldn't stay where I set it. It would overheat, sometimes getting to 90 degrees. This morning it must have shorted out and actually was on fire. Could be a faulty machine, but if the thermostat starts malfunctioning I'd return it right away."
1,Unit stopped working after one season,"Like many others, we also purchased this unit at Target over a year ago and used it for about four months last season. It warmed our bedroom very well and the digital features were convenient. A few weeks into this season however, the unit has appeared to burn out - and does not turn on at all. Without a receipt, Target is not taking responsibility and we have contacted Honeywell directly and are awaiting response. Hopefully, their customer service is more reliable than their product.RT"
2,Shoddy,"I agree with the others that this space heater is poorly designed or built. The thermostat on my brand new unit is not effective at all in controlling the heat (goes well above the programmed temp without shutting off). After less than a month of operation, it will randomly shut off when it is not programmed to do so. As others have mentioned, the plug gets hot as well which is cause for concern. If I had the option of returning it, I would."
2,just ok...,"I own one of this years ago and it works just fine, but the temperature sensor is not that accurate.And recently I decided to get another one from Target and it was a defect item.. oil leaks after 1st use...I think I won't get this anymore..."
3,"""Duh""",ProsAlmost everything.ConsIf the the power goes off for 1/2 second it resets to off. So that makes it worthless to wake up to a freezing cold room. Buy the models with standard non-digital controls. They come back on when the power resumes right where you left it.
2,Heats well but the construction is incredibly shoddy.,"I have used these types of heaters to supplement my gas furnace for several years now. I have a few different brands. I bought this heater at Walmart for half the regular price since the weather is starting to warm up here. I can say without a doubt that it heats well. That's the end of the good.We haven't had this heater long. The ""silver"" you see around the control panel on the front? It's actually plastic and after the second time using it, it is melted and warped. That cannot be good. Also, 3 of the 4 casters on the bottom have broken off. Occasionally, it gives off an odor too.I have another Honeywell heater like this. It is a white model and it is at least 10 years old. It doesn't have the digital control panel and there is no plastic on it. It works GREAT!"
1,Broke After a Few Weeks,"I used this item daily for a few weeks, then it just wouldn't turn on. Tried different outlets and everything and no response. I will update my review to reflect how this works out trying to use the warranty."
2,Stopped working after three years,"We purchased two of these heaters and they worked fine for three winters. Now this year they will not turn on. The manufacturer, KAZ said they can not be fixed but if we ship them back to them (at our expense) they can replace them under the warranty. It sounded like this was a common problem. It is disturbing to me that they would be designed in a way that causes them to stop working after a few years. That is poor quality workmanship in my opinion."
1,Uncontrolled overheating problem is lethal,It worked fine for a few months then I noticed one night when I went in to our kids bedroom in the middle of the night that it was like an oven in there. The honeywell heater had been set to low heat at 70F. The temperature was reading 85F. It would be one thing if it was in a garage but my kids bedroom!!! They were sweating profusely in their sleep. It is a major health hazard and could be a fire hazard. Do not buy it.
1,Ours was a menace,"After a year or two ours started turning itself onto high, staying on, and getting very, very hot. Its own temperature reading would be much higher than the set temperature. We just cut the cord and threw it in the trash. I just noticed that someone else had an identical problem. We have used a few space heaters, and I would suggest that for various safety reasons you get an oil radiator, but with an old-fashioned manual power switch (off-low-med-high) so that you can set it on low and know that it will stay there."
4,Good for bedroom,"If you are looking to heat up a fairly open space i.e. living room, den, or family room do not get this heater. But if you want to heat up your bedroom for those cold nights then this is the heater for you. It heats up the room without cooking you. The digital thermostat is nice, I like to set it at 72 for a moderately toasty feel. If 72 is your chosen temperature what this unit does is raise the temperature to 74 then shut off then turn back on at 70, so basically you will have a constant gradual 4 degree swing.The unit is heavy, so storage may be a problem for some but overall it does what it is supposed to do."
1,Not Made to Last,Like most other viewers here. I bought this heater because it was quite and energy efficient. After 6 months of use it started to heatup to 80+ degrees. I didn't notice this till I woke up one morning sweating. Iturned it down unplugged it and it worked well for a few more weeks. It now doesn't do anything. It turns on displays an incorrect temperature and doesn't heat.
1,Randomly Shuts Off,"I just bought this today, and about 15 minutes after turning it on, it just randomly shut itself off. It does this repeatedly. My apartment is still cold, and now I've got to go return it to get my money back."
1,Out of Control Heater,"I trusted the Honeywell name, but after this heater, I would NEVER buy Honeywell again.I had this heater for about a month. I use it for my bedroom that is always the coldest room in the home. I program it for 70 degrees. I woke up in the middle of the night sweating. I got up and the temp in the bedroom was 90 degrees. Remember it was set for 70.I thought it was just a fluke, but not at all. About every other time I turn it on the temp starts going up uncontrollably.Other than that one minor problem, it is VERY quiet and effecient when not out of control.I would think twice before buying this."
1,Made for junkyard,"The digital thermostat broke after two months. Unit won't shut off even after desired temperature had been reached. If the thermostat breaks, the unit will heat the room to very dangerous level. It may cause heat exhaustion or death if you are not careful. I would stay away from this unit. Very dangerous and needs to be recalled!!!!"
3,oil heater,"I reviewed several heaters before buying this one. Unfortunately, it took several hours to heat up a 10 x10 room to 72. I returned the product after seeing a Kenmore model that really put out the heat."
2,Slow to heat even a small room,"I bought this last december and, new to heaters, i bought this oil filled one. After doing some research online, this was one of the more expensive heaters that's available in the target store near my place. Tried heating a living room, which was about 700 sq ft but of course, it only heats about 5 inches its radius. I have to put this as close to me as possible and still feel very cold. Use it in my room that's about 150 sq ft and was only able to warm up about 15"" its radius. Decided to get a delonghi and it hits the room faster than oil filled radiator."
1,Don't buy it.,I bought this heater last year from Wal-Mart. The heater worked great. This year it worked for about a month and now it will not even come on.
1,It works - but also the cord catches on fire.,"Yes, the heater works as described by the literature. The downside: this model appears to have a history of cords overheating and in some cases either melting and/or catching on fire. In our case, the cord melted at the outlet, melted the outlet and if we had not been home would have caused a serious fire. So, unless you are going to keep this heater under continuous watch. do not buy it. See reports at Consumer Product Safety Agency for details."
1,DANGEROUS! Do Not Buy,"I have an older honeywell radiator in my toddler's room, so I bought this for my new baby. The temperature sensor must be defective because though I had it set at 70 degrees, it heated the room to 89 degrees the first night. I thank god that my baby started crying cause she was hot, and that it wasn't a tragedy. This item is dangerous. Don't buy it. Or if you do, test it in an empty room to make sure it's running properly. But it's not worth risking your children's lives."
5,Attractive and well constructed,"What first got my attention was the looks. The unit seems very well constructed and the chrome and black are very attractive... Pictures don't due it justice. Second was the digital temperature read out. The controls are easy to use. Setting the temp, time it stays on and heat output level is a snap. The unit heats up quickly and does a nice job of keeping a 15x20 room warm. I highly recommend it."
2,Cheap thermostat,"I bought this product about 12 months ago at Target and have used it frequently over the last year. While it is silent and does what it is supposed to do, the negative review stems from the thermostat, which has never been accurate (off by several degrees) and just broke last week... The good news is that Honeywell will replace it, no questions asked. I just have to pay for shipping my unit back and $10 to cover shipping the new unit to me. Hopefully the new unit will work longer than 12 months!"
1,bad thermostats,"Like many other reviews, I want to warn you about bad thermostats on this model. I have had two of them. Both malfunctioned. One wouldn't turn off & overheated many times. The 2nd kept turning off before it got to the temperature set on the thermostat. My advice - youkinfuggedaboudit. - PDJ"
1,thermostat problem,"this heater throws off great heat,however i purchased it so my room would stay at the same temp.i set it to 69 on 2nd setting.1 hr later went in and it was 78 degrees.if you dont care about thermostate setting get the one for 39 bucks. just as good."
3,More penny - less Christmas,"I had loved Father Foxes' Pennyrhymes and delighted in reading it to my four children - so much so that it dissolved in shreds over time. I just bought two of the Christmas Rhymes for grandchildren and was a bit disappointed, The darkness of the green I found a little heavy, and the drawings on Pennyrhymes was a little finer, I thought. Also the poetry was a tad lurchy. But it is so much better than most of the things for children these days that the grandchildren will still have Christmas for Christmas."
5,Great bang for the buck!,"You can't go wrong... This system is a champ in all areas. Good power, bass and clarity balance out a fine system for any home theater beginner or even a pro looking for good value for the money. I'm sure that there are other systems with smaller speakers with comparible sound, but with tons of S-Video inputs, a solid 150 watt self-powered sub and 650 watts of total power... you just can't go wrong. After checking out out comparible systems, you just can't get a better built, solid sounding system for the money. Onkyo delivers with this solid entry-level system that will satisfy many a home theater lover's needs."
2,sounds ok but,I purchased this HT about 4 months ago and have just had the second sub-woofer go out. I live in the country and don't have to worry about complaints from neighbors. I like to listen at elevated levels especially during movies. During certain movies the sub will start to rattle violently and by the time I get it turned down it is toast. I would not recommend this HT if you like to push the performance.
4,Nice vegetable blend,"Flavorful, peas really stand out, without being overpowering. Easy to eat, tasty and satisfying. Good snack food for any age."
3,Not a fave,My daughter didn't love this flavor. I think the flavors are not as bold as other Earth's Best Purees. But we love the Earth's Best line of products. We use the food as well as the diapers.
2,Not very tasty,The baby did not like this food (and he is not a picky eater) but tolerated it when mixed with some pureed fruit. We will not be buying it again.
4,Bridge Professional's life.,"Alan Sontag's Bridge bum presents a vivid description of the life of a professional bridge player. The challenge match against the Italian Blue team wherein the winning team was to get five Lancia cars; the fierce competition at the Cavendish Calcutta - an event Sontag and his partner won despite the strong field; a rubber bridge game in Jamaica where Sontag played as a jockey; and a small local tournament where Sontag and his partner played on a sixty-five year young woman's team just to help here fulfil her dream of winning that championship are the main stories around which the narration revolves. The book itself is full of Bridge discussion, and would definitely help those who wish to do well in bridge tournaments."
3,A good book...,I thought the book was good but not something I'd pick up & read again. There wasn't very much action or suspense but it was good nonetheless. The storyline was a good one but I expected more from it. If you don't mind a slow romance then go ahead & read this book but if you are looking for a bunch of excitement I'd try another one.
3,in like a lion... out like a .......,"The first half of this book was WONDERFUL, I was soo excited!!!! The story was gripping from the first line. Wonderful chemistry and excellent plot. HOWEVER, the second half of the book was not as well written and it seemed she tried to cram too many plot lines into one book. At one point in the story the Female Lead says she ""will only marry for love and therefore if he wants her, he will have to court her properly."" (THUS THE TITLE) So, I looked forward to his efforts to win her heart. Which did not happen for on the very next page the courting was completely forgotten and never revisited. I was disappointed. I was also not satisfied with the ending. In the beginning you are left wondering about so many things and in the end the answers are all rushed and bogus. Still worth reading. Just a bummer to have it start so solid and fall apart in the end."
5,Courting Susannah,This was a wonderful book - the great quality of Linda Lael Miller is evident in the writing of this story. Following Susannah and her battle to over come her feelings for her old friend and her growing feelings for her dead friends husband is wonderful. Couldn't put it down.
3,Started Out a Real Winner,"This is the first Linda Lael Miller book that I have read, and I was disappointed with this one. It started out really good, but then it began to drag on and on.I really couldn't get the love connection between Suvannah and Aubrey. They fall in love and then he begins the courtship? Hmmmmmmm.This book started out a real winner, but it lost its zip somewhere into the story."
1,Send me the wrong book. I received a Study Guide instead of Text book!!!,I am not sure what is the issue here when I typed in the ISBN number for the text book I should have received the TEXT book and NOT Study guide instead.I am very disappointed with the service.
2,Don't buy!,"The author does a good job of exlpaining Economics, Priciples and Policy. But, his organizational skills are limited. The chapters are out of order in my opinion."
2,Noisy Cot,"The cot is comfortable, light, easy to set up but it is so noisy that it will keep everybody awake. I took two of these cots for a weekend in a remote cabin. Two adults used the cots. Every time one of the cot users rolled over or moved, the cot made so much noise that it woke up people two rooms away (okay, the walls were thin too). The fabric is wrapped around the metal tubes and makes a loud creaking noise as it rubs on the tube. The noise was so loud that we laughed about it all weekend but did not sleep on the cots after the first night."
2,"well, it keeps ya off the ground.","It is very hard to keep this thing in the right position. The legs keep wanting to fold in, especially if you are not on concrete-flat ground, and so every time you move in the night it collapses on you. I is not happy."
1,Coleman? Not the Coleman I know..,"Cots are made to rest on, and perhaps sleep.Not these cots. They are mini 4th of July shows, without all the traffic and the bright lights. Oh, don't worry, the WOW factor is there. Everyone around you will be WOW'd at how much noise can come out of a little tiny cot. Honestly, it sounds like you are rubbing huge balloons together, and that comes from every inch of the cot as you move. Stay as far away from these if you can. Sleeping on cold floor tiles are better than this.Coleman should be ashamed of themselves on this one."
1,Did not get what I wanted.,"I placed the order, the wrong item arrived much smaller. I then called and they reordered the item for me...the second time another wrong item arrived, finally they said there must be a wrong control number attached to this item, they said they were sorry but they could not fill my order because they could not figure out how to get me a Coleman Forester Cot (30""X80"")that they have on the web site.Do you really want to order this item?"
5,Excellent modern day faeire,"Mercedes Lackey really pulls it together in this one. Elves, music, and mortal in a modern setting so very believable. The characters work well, and the good guys are not always right and perfect.There are so many mediocre modern fairy tales that it was a pleasure to read this one. The only other one that comes close was ""War of the Oaks"" by Emma Bull.Mercedes Lackey does several modern fantasy works, but I feel this is the best of them all. Interestingly enough they are all tied together loosly, with occasional comments scattered throughout them to give a richer environment then just a single series would do.Lackey's strengths in characters and their motivations really comes to the fore in this book, as well as her excllent story telling ability and imagery. I heartily recommend this book."
5,Just could not put it down.,"I picked the book up by accident at a used book store, and just couldn't put it down. Ms Lackey has the ability to put you into the story and make you think that you can smell the smells, taste the food, and see the people. I enjoy her work and think that it should be compulsory reading in schools, for English Lit classes."
4,Tor and Baen books..,"Tor and Baen recently people their books on e-book in the last few days, hoping Misty can get some action and get them sold on Amazon or BN. They're a pain the rear to sideload, but they're worth the wait!"
2,Very annoying host; mediocre show.,"The producers have managed to make what could be a great show, into a mediocre yawn-fest. The self-serving host, Sean Riley comes across like a narcissistic douche! He inserts himself into every situation, calls it a tight spot, then takes credit for coming to the rescue. Watch the reactions from the actual workers, particularly when they say ""thanks for your help, we couldn't have done it without you"" -- you can tell he did practically nothing, and was just in the way."
4,An essential piece of the puzzle,"For those who are not familiar with Shunryu Suzuki, this tape may not be helpful. For those like myself who chronically read ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"", this recording of Suzuki's lectures is a fascinating piece of the puzzle in the mystery. Listening to his halting, lapidary but sometimes humorous speech, I got an unusual connection to the real person and got an inkling of why he viewed ""Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind"" as the understanding of his disciples - not as his understanding."
4,"Useful, But Limited.","This relatively short instructional book is written for people who have never taught preschool children before in a church or Sunday school setting. It contains many useful thoughts, ideas, and tips; but is limited because it is specifically written towards new, preschool Sunday school/church educators. The title is rather misleading in that aspect; I thought this would give me some new ideas or advice for the preschool classes I teach on a daily basis. Instead, all I got were a few useful tips and not much else. Some of the material is a little dated, but the book nevertheless fulfills it's directive for it's intended audience."
4,"as described, ill do business again","I will do business again, book was described and accurate.Good prices and deleivery service was also very good and priced right"
3,Motor wears out too quickly,"My cats love this fountain. One of them has urinary issues so it's essential to make sure he drinks enough water. My problem with it is the pump stops working very quickly. I kept it clean according to instructions, but have had to reorder at least four new pumps in the last two years or so. I'm going to try the Drinkwell fountain and see if that is better. If you don't mind the hassle of constantly replacing pumps, it's a good product."
3,excellant book But...,"Overall the book is excellant, but the section on remastering Knoppix has instructions that are vague, misleading and in some cases downright incorrect. The section on using mkisofs to create another iso image is flat out incorrect per the mkisofs man page."
4,Totally Stunning!,This book is really beautiful the scenes are like a gentle lullaby and to boot its educational I recommend all Thomas Lockers books!
5,Cloud Dance,This book has some of the most beautiful pictures of clouds! A perfect compliment to my cloud lesson plans. Thank you!
2,"If you have stomach problems, do not take","The Ethyl Alcohol made me quite sick for several days. If you have any issues with your stomach, you need to think twice on this one."
2,"Confusing, disjointed and too expensive in my opinion.","I teach Statistics for a living, and this book replaced the book by Weiers, a move that I have berated the folks that do our purchasing ever since. The other Stats lecturer felt the same, and we have ended up using old copies of the prior book.For example, the book gives a miserly single page to explain Quartiles, and has very little in the way of examples that are helpful.If you HAVE to have it because your school dictates, you have to have it, but if you want to buy a book for the purpose of teaching yourself Stats, look elsewhere."
4,Another Great tool form Jet,"I purchased my Jet lathe when it went on sale at Woodworkers warehouse before they closed, And as many other have just for the fun of it I had no jobs line up for it at first but boy it was a great buy. As a starter on the lathe I cant not find one complant with this product. Do you have to weigh it down? well that is all on how much you are turning but when you have to place wood across the supports and toss what every you have that has weight on it. no problem. I have to say for the money Jet did Good on this one. (to any one who is thinking about turning, try it you wont be sorry ) As for your Turning Set besure to shop around the best price is not always the best package. I got my lathe with the Turning chisels and face sheild which in the long run ran me cheaper to get as a package. it may be cheaper for you as well. 4 stars being I got what I paid for."
4,"Jet JWL-1236 / 708352 12"" Variable Speed Wood Lathe with Stand","This is my second 1236 Jet lathe. I purchased one three years ago and have been very satisfied with it.The only complaint I have with this new lathe is that the Head was .0010"" lower than the tail stock.,switched tail stocks which didn't help, so I shimmed the head up and all is well now. I may have beenupset if this was a more expensive lathe, but At $578 and free shipping from Amazon this lathe is stilla bargain.My first Jet has been a real workhorse and I look forward to many years of service from both lathes.If I ever need another wood lathe you can bet it will be a Jet 1236."
2,Replacing it after 4 years,"I bought this lathe in 2007 and use it for mostly pens and small items. I have never turned anything as large as a table leg on it. By the beginning of 2011 the bearings were completly shot. I can do small faceplate work but if I use the tailstock, the bearing noise is deafening and I can't get enough accuracy to even turn pens. The steel is really soft in the tapers and galls easily. At least I can smooth it out with sanding cloth.I replaced this lathe with a Nova DVR XP."
4,Sweet machine,"I'm a new turner and my rating of 4 stars is only due to my lack of time on any other lathe. With that being said, the Jet went together in a matter of minutes and in spite of my lack of experience, and some operator malfunctioning, I was turning spindles with very little practice and just reference to a couple of books. The height is perfect for me but I'm not tall (5' 9"") and I put it on an HTC mobile base. I could see that (walking around) being a potential problem if I was turning bowls but I experimented by adding some sandbags to the lower shelf and that kept it stationary. I just took a look at the current price and in spite of how much I like this machine, I would wait on one of Amazon's sales. Would I buy it again? You bet."
2,Left the best parts out!!,"This DVD set is an abridged set of the telenovela ""En Nombre del Amor""..For brevity they edited down the series to the bare bones...The best parts are left out...Not sure why they did it but it ruined it for me... It's kind of like when you read a book and then see the movie about it...Not the same.."
5,book/bad girl creek,the book came very quickly and it was in perfect condition and a wonderful read. now i want to read all of jo ann mapson. thank you.
2,Not worth your time,I did not enjoy this book at all. The characters were not credible and the attempts at humour were weak.
5,I loved this book!!,I loved this book. Remains one of my favorites. I like most of this authors books. I like the way she writes.
4,A Comfort Book,"It took me several chapters of Jo-Ann Mapson's novel to decide if I liked Bad Girl Creek. But once I got into the book I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bad Girl Creek is a story of friendship and love. Phoebe, a thirty something year old woman who is confined to a wheel-chair, finds herself the inheritor of her deceased aunt's flower farm. Still grieving from the loss of her aunt, Phoebe takes on 3 roommates. The duration of Bad Girl Creek centers on how Phoebe comes to find these new roommates & the friendships that form among them. Each roommate brings to the novel her own set of baggage that she must work out. This story is about friendship, of finding one's place in life, of learning to trust others & of having faith. Though the characters have problems, the writing is light and has just enough depth and comfort to make it a worthwhile read."
4,Cute Story!,"I liked this book, especially Juan and Phoebe. I can't wait to read ""Along Came Mary"" and ""Goodbye Earl"" to find out what happens next!"
4,Totally Enjoyed!!,"I really enjoyed the book. The characters were wonderful. Very human, complete with flaws. They all begin with those flaws, feeling themselves lost and adrift, but when they find each other, they find themselves and realize that they are all strong women. When I read the last page I knew there had to be a sequel. I haven't read it yet but will be picking that up soon. I hope Mapson continues with the same strong characters. I lent this to friends who have enjoyed it as well."
5,I closed my eyes and listened and I was there!,"Unlike some of Mrs. Ross's other ""loyal"" fans, I like this CD and its sound quality. I think that she sounds just as fresh and new and beautiful as she did in 1961. Diana, you go girl!"
2,Disappointing,"This is a lackluster live performance from the usually dependable Miss Ross. Her voice is thin and tired on this particular performance, and the songs are so rushed, you wonder why she even bothered at all. The album also suffers because many of the tracks were songs she was releasing at the time, such as Workin' Overtime, Dirty Looks and This House. They sound dated now, and the live performances don't make them any better.If you want to hear Diana in a better live setting, pick up 'Live At Caesars Palace' or 'An Evening With...'."
5,Warm and non-judgemental,I found this book heart warming and insightful. In times of stress and change this would be a good book to read. It reminds you that change is part of life and something to embrace.
2,Not a Great Compilation,"Unless you are looking for a smattering of several different formats to get feel for A & C, the average consumer and A & C fan would be better-off buying a selected individual movie or the new 8 movie collection coming out in February. The movies included are weak compared to the usual A & C talent-studded endeavors (Jack and the Beanstalk and Africa Screams). These are two of the earlier works - not bad, but not up to their other films, in my opinion. They lack the story quality, settings, and cast of their other films that they manage to work their great humor around so successfully.The other DVD's weren't bad and include their history of work and lives on one and clips of their television show on the other. Again, OK, but there are so many other great ones available!"
2,MGM,"Further information regarding the two films in this box, Africa & Jack is that they were made by MGM after the boys were lent out to them; a common practice in the days when stars were contracted to the studios. This is also the reason why these two films are not included on the Universal Box Sets as they were made by MGM. They are not held in high regard, the humour is thin and sparse and lacks the magic of some of the others."
2,TO BIG WORDS.,"IF YOU HAVE A PHD THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. BUT IF NOT, YOU WILL NEED A BIG DICTIONARY FOR THE BIG WORDS. WHY IS IT PEOPLE USE SUCH BIG WORD IN A SELF HELP BOOK IS BEYOND ME. IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW, IF THE AUTHOR USES WORDS YOU DON'T KNOW IT'S TWICE AS HARD."
2,photo hobbyist,The vendor gave me very good service but I had to return the battery grip because the batteries drained much sooner than what I expected. They lasted no where near the 3500 shots that was reported. I even wonder if this was a defective item. I also felt that it made the camera too heavy and I decided that I would be better of buying a back up dedicated battery instead
4,DSLR A100 Battery Grip,Don't know actually how much battery life I've gained using the battery grip compared to the A100's battery. Uses way to many batteries. but if it's suppose to last way longer I guess it's worth it. Adds heft and bulk to the A100. Like the Multiple shutter buttons. gives you various grip options. Sort of gives the A100 a Pro Digital Camera look.I also have the A100 Body Armour. Which is great by itself but as of now!!! not compatible with the Optima BPG. Had to modify a $40.00 Body Armour to get it the way I like. Bottom Line so far I like mine. It's on the camer always I'm for it. The Downside for me is Bulkiness it adds to the A100. I'm not a Pro and the Ideal of carrying a Bulky camera around all day does'nt suit me. I can deal with the added Heft. I guess I'll see how long I can deal with the Bulk when I go on Vacation.
2,This thing is smaller than it looks.,"I bought this for a gift ... and the recipient thought it was some freebie from her bank. This clock is very small in size, feels kind-of cheap ... and the projection is tiny! It seems like it has a lot of features, but is not easy to program with out reading ... there are only 4 buttons on the back."
5,Sure thing.,You can't go wrong with these guys. They are among the world's best on manouche guitar and now a lot easier to find. Used to have to send mail orders to Holland.
2,Not effective!,"This oil warmer does not do what it claims to do! I hardly smell any fragrance when this unit is plugged in, even within a couple of feet from it. It has a setting wheel, which was meant to control the fragrance levels....but where is the fragrance in the air?? Also, the oil does not last long....its all gone just in a week or so. Just a waste of money. My unit is now in the closet...that way I am saving on the refills!"
1,not happy,"I ordered this book used, but in good shape it said, it was missing a page, no big deal if the seller would return my emails and help me replace the book. I have emailed 3 times and received nothing, so I am very dissatisfied with the product and service."
3,Low Quality,"I was very disapointed with this set. The Menu is half French half English and there are no extras.But worst of all was the fact that the video is not 16x9 (it is 4:3) and there is no hi def sound. Only one sound option (besides the french option).None of this is shown in the description.This is not a ""Box"" set, but rather, it is 6 disks folded into a single DVD case with no printed material at all. No episode list. Nothing.Season 5 starts out very strange and gets stranger. It has very little to do with the previous 4 seasons. Most notably is the loss of Lexa Doig as Andromeda.These DVD's have the look of a home made set."
4,works as designed,I wouldnt be writing this review if mine hadnt fallen off the camera into the Hudson river New York.A perfect replacment for the original and have not lost it yet.
2,A Fallen Flower,"I bought this lens hood as a replacement for one that fell off and was lost while I was carrying the camera around. As a lens shade, it does the job of keeping light off the front element satisfactorily, and shows very little vignetting even at 18mm, but the bayonet attachment is not as positive as one would expect, given the overall lens and camera quality."
5,Very Pleased,The product was exactly what I wanted. It was very appropriately packaged and in first class condition when received.
4,keeps out the glare,"lost my original lens hood so i got this. the good thing is that it works on other lenses with 67mm filter threads, like the tamron 17-50 and 28-75. as far as lens hoods go, it's ok. it's pretty small, and it's not lined with felt of velvet like some lens hoods. it's petal-type, so there are cut-outs in its diameter, built of medium-strength plastic. the only reason to buy this is if you lose the one that came with your camera. you could go without it, but it does help to keep out flare in bright-light situations, and can be reversed for a trimmer fit in the bag."
5,Bob's Choice,Item sent on time and received in excellent condition. I recommend this vendor based on my dealings.
3,Seems faulty,"Much cheaper than the alternative dell product but seems to have problems starting up at times. Fairly frequently when I turn on the power to the adapter, the light will fail to light up and it doesn't supply power to my laptop for much longer than it should take. I've had it take over 30 minutes before supplying power to my laptop!"
5,One of the best black gospel albums ever,"This is a God-inspired album with a lot of gospel power. You can almost feel THG as you listen to the songs, and all of His many blessings. By the album !"
4,Good stuff - wrong application,"I intended to use this in order to hang a very large (32K pc) puzzle (in sections) directly onto the wall. The size of the sheets are perfect, working with the material is straight forward. Unfortunately, the adhesive did not stick well to the back of the puzzle (which is blue cardboard-like material). Regardless of how much pressure I used, I was unable to peel off the paper backing from the adhesive, the adhesive lifted off with the paper backing. I imagine it would work perfectly for gluing smooth paper, but it does not work on puzzle backs."
5,Adhesive,I always use this product when mounting stitcheries that I then frame. It holds securely. Recommend this product for anyone who needs a large area covered with adhesive.
3,Pretty Good Club Track,this song works well in a club.I got a bit tired of it after a while because it got played so much.it's standard Dr.Dre production overall.the song works mainly for the Groove.
3,A little on the weak side,"I actually bought this game used and felt that It was a good 5 dollar investment, if you are looking for an advanced baseball game go pick up Griffey baseball or something other than this. If you are looking for just a baseball game then you are in the right ballpark. Mediocre graphics, Easy to learn and the computer doesnt put up much of a fight. Its also very hard to hit in this game on All star mode but I somehow managed to put up 85 points on the yankees. Leaves something to be desired."
2,a little flimsy,a little flimsy compared to nicholson or lenox blades. they have a tendency to twist even in my high tension hacksaw frame. would only recommend on the lightest of materials or perhaps pvc.
5,Great material for self-practice,This is really great opportunity to know what's the issue and point when playing this concerto.
3,Meh,"Felt amazing at first, but the little foot-massaging knobs quickly started breaking and falling out everywhere. I'm still wearing them, but they're not nearly as comfortable."
3,A good 38 page start that doesn't make it to the finish line,"""Guide to Owning a Maine Coon Cat"" starts out strong with a detailed exposition of the various Maine Coon origin theories: the 'Marie Antoinette'; the 'Viking'; the 'Racoon cross'; the 'Lynx cross', among others (I favor the 'Viking' since Maine Coons and Norwegian Forest Cats look an awful lot alike).The author then spends a good deal of print on the Maine Coon personality and the breed standard and colors. The photographs are beautiful, professional and in color.It's when we get to the chapters on care, grooming, and feeding that this book strays away from Maine Coons and becomes generic and uninteresting. The photographs deteriorate into advertisements for various grooming and food products. Some show the covers of other books from the same firm that published this book, i.e. T.F.H. Publications, Inc.Go ahead and buy this book, but buy it for the first 38 pages."
2,Half-baked Book,"The first half of this book is very good detailing the Maine Coon breed, history and standards. Wonderful photos. The second half fails miserably. It is too generic. It does not go into specific details about this particular breed. It just gives the general feeding and caring patterns which are similar to other cats and other books that I have read. It does not tell you what the ideal weight should be, etc. Another area that it fails is to tell you about a specific hereditary trait which I found out about on the internet: hip dysplasia. So only two stars for this book."
2,Duck and run,This device really slows the router. The problem is that there is a lack of information on what are the relative speeds for some of the popular sizes of routers in the marketplace. I am not asking for rpm to the nearest decimal but a rough guide to the expected speeds. For example I have a 2.5 hp Makita router and I have a 3 inch diameter bit that the bit manufacturer suggests should not be run a more than a certain rpm - for safety reasons. So I purchased this device for that expressed reason. The device can be adjusted from zero to ten and that is it. It comes with no documentation that one could use as a guide in changing to the different settings. So at the moment I'm just guessing and getting ready to duck and run if the bit decides that it is running too fast and needs to leave the router.
1,Print Screen Deluxe 6.1,"Hi,Beware of buying AmericanSystems newest Print Screen Deluxe. There is no email support. I tried to phone them and no one is returning my pleas for help. I now paid for version 6.1 twice, and it keeps saying it is STILL a trial version and will run out in 30 days!!! I have owned print Screen 2.0 up to version 5.0. I will find my old copy of PSD and install it, and be out 29.95 twice! I won't try a third time to register Print Screen Deluxe 6.1 This is sad....Wally"
3,Playing to the gallery,"These Rand-type publications are basically for specialists speaking to specialists in their own field (defense analysis). As such, their relevance, impact and even credibility are suspect. Who can have predicted China would be the standard for Communist market reform in the 1980s? Who predicted Russia would collapse in the 1990s? Not the specialists, who basically linearly project and use least-squares analysis (read: continuity) for their predictions.A must read only if you are embedded in the military-industrial complex."
2,"Great book, scruffy copy.","Great classic book, but this copy - ex public library and covered in their stamps, was very scruffy - I should have bought new."
2,Molds,bought to make bath bombs should have read it candy mold was too fragile to make the bath fizzies oh well
4,Gospel Lover,I love alot of James Cleveland's music. It is sad that today's Gospel music has such a secular sound. The reason being is that most of it is not Holy Spirit inspired.
2,Best of Rev James Cleveland & Gmwa,"Rev. James Cleveland has very few CDs out. Many of them are of his greatest hits and each of them only has about a two-minute snippet of each song. This CD is no different except the ""snippets"" are longer. The songs are not done in their entirety. Maybe most of them had half of the song on there. I still have a lot of his record albums. I doubt that they will ever be converted to CDs on the market. However, people have put his a lot of his songs on YouTube."
2,Buy a more expensive one,"I purchased this - as an adult female, the fit is pretty close, my nose is squished and i can not wear my glasses. In addition the interior is not well finished (dripping looking plastic) and contains no padding. the helmet is uncomfortable and does not sit right on my head."
4,Cool,"I really liked this helmet, it looks realistic and it is a full helmet (not a mask) so that is awesome, it looks great in pictures! But it is very uncomfortable to wear for a long time, it is very difficult to see while wearing it (and I can't wear it with my glasses).So if you're planning to wear it for a halloween costume I am not sure if that is a good idea since I can't wear it for longer than 15min without having to take it off and breath. But it looks great as decoration and in pictures. It is definitely realistic."
5,Amazing and elegant,"I have had physics in high school and undergraduate school but it was introductory and non calculus based. Michio Kaku does an amazing job explaining the history of physics, Einstein's personality and work, the changes in physics since his critical innovations, and how history itself affected Einstein and the other pioneers of this field. Kaku, like Einstein, is able to take complex ideas and explain them in a way that is incredibly simple. I found this book to be thoroughly engaging and I read it surprisingly fast. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Lists aircraft concepts I never saw, or haven't seen anything on in decades.","I'm a aerospace engineer with 30 years in the biz. I'm pretty familiar with a lot of unusual craft, and this book (sometimes very briefly) lists some I've never seen mentioned in decades. With good photos and illos."
3,Christmas Happy,"We like the Groovy Girl clothes that completely open up so they don't have to be pulled over the doll's head. My four year old can then dress and undress her by herself and this outfit does that. She did not pay any attention to the cloth ornament, but played with the gingerbread man as a second doll.This cloth doll with yarn hair is like all the other Groovy Girls - Happy expression and multipart outfits. Cloth clothes on cloth doll may be more difficult for preschoolers to manipulate because cloth on cloth doesn't slide much, but a 6 year old guest liked dressing and undressing, matching and mixing, and used the velcro closures gingerly. I like the Groovy Girls but I keep them out of the hands of 3's and under, and anyone else that can't keep the long yarn hair out of their mouth."
1,Not Durable,We bought this for our office. The cart's wheel broke off lifting boxes no where near it's weight rating. It's less than three months old. It's not at all durable. Not worth the money. Not recommended.
1,Impressive roll call but visually monotonous,"Sharp is described by the publisher as ""a collection the likes of which have never been seen before"", a book with such ""brilliant lenswork"" that it allows one ""repeated viewings that never tire or bore.""If you are a photo editor that wants to run images of celebrities that depict every pore, with contrast on the image so intense that the subjects look like coal miners on their way home after a day in the pits, then this is your man and he's in the phone book under Creative Photographers, Inc.In short, while Sharp represents an impressive roll call of celebrity faces, Parry's style is quickly revealed to be visually monotonous in the form of a collection."
1,The Worst,"At the risk of being repetitious, most all the low ratings are right on the mark. This documentary is a real disappointment. Most documentaries interview friends, colleagues and loved ones about the subject of interest in order to give the viewer insight about the person - this film does not do that. The full scope of Madonna's life is not touched on; the video clips and still imagery are the same over and over again (likely, they could not afford or obtain permission to secure rights to use more); the primary ""storytellers"" are an obscure Madonna biographer and a Madonna impersonator who doesn't look much like her. The storyline covers the basics on Madonna that you probably already know and not much more. I am recommending or maybe warning you not to buy this before viewing. I rented it online and glad i did not buy. What a waste of time."
1,Horrible,"Horrible narrator, horrible look-a-like (because they couldn't show M herself). Save your money! The only nice thing about this dvd is the extra with Madonna on the red carpet, but the sound quality is bad. One bit of that extra is a question asked to M at a press conference, but you can't hear the question.. Don't buy this dvd, it is a waste of your money."
1,Is not Madonna,"The person that appears in the DVD is not Madonna, is a fan. Didn't like it at all! Very dissapointed!"
2,"Boo, stinky basketball game","This is a good game if there's a lot of people at your house, but the Season mode does't live up to its NBA Jam predecessors. It also uses every space on a normal memory card,so don't buy this game unless you need every basketball game on earth."
2,"Okay game, but overall waste of money","This game has some of the best cheats, most awesome moves, and a great training area. The big (and I do mean BIG) problem is the fact that it takes up an entire memory pack just for this game. I bought ""The World Is Not Enough"" and it takes up only 2 pages (image that!) of memory. This biotch is so outdated that it takes up all 121 pages. And anything you want to save must be on a memory pack! Forget about a season, it can't even keep the name of your favorite team in Exhibition. A typical Nintendo Memory Pak costs about 10 bucks! That is almost more than the game! Unless you have a constant supply of memory paks, don't even consider buying this!"
1,oogey,Horrible. The gameplay is trash and I have only made a 3-pionter in 1 time with Tim Duncan for the whole time I rented it. There are way to many fouls and the players on your team are idiots. You can't charge the basket because your get stopped.
1,NBA Slam '99,"This game was a lesson learned. It was extreemly too hard to play and you couldn't even change that. But perhaps that was because there might have been something wrong with the version I rented and/or the instruction manual was missing. Anyhow, I'm glad it was just a rental. I'd rather have a normal version of a game to own, not to mention an INSTRUCTON MANUAL (I'm mad at whoever threw that away). The fact that you couldn't change the difficulty of the game was a BIG detraction from the fun. That's why I liked NBA Courtside Featuring Kobe Bryant a lot better. It was a whole lot easier and funner. Buy Courtside if you want an easier version to play, but buy this game if you don't care about not being able to win ever but just want to *TRY* to play."
3,Product Dimensions,"I was disappointed with this product. It turned out to be a ""pocket"" Neopet. The dimensions provided in the advetisement turned out to be the size of the packaging NOT the size of the Neopet. I expected a 4 and 1/2 in tall Neopet not a package that size."
2,Works great until,Bought three of these and two have had the lock button fall out never to be seen again. The wand still works but you can't lock the water on.I think it is just poor material selection as the buttons are plastic and the lock button is held in place with little plastic projections. Both broke within two weeks of use.
4,Who is in charge up there?,Bill Bixby lives! At least in our memories. May he rest in that great Steambath in the sky.....still smoking that cigar and defying a higher power to dismiss him to oblivion.
1,I can't believe this got 5 stars~~~,"This book is an OK resource as resources go - the big problem is that it is not written in ENGLISH - the continuous grammatical errors and problems with syntax make the book a nightmare to go through - in some cases evern confusing simple configuration explanations and in other cases, due to misplaced noun-verb agreement - just wrong advice. Buy a different book.I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS BOOK WENT TO PRINT - a mere one-time run-through with MS-Word's grammar checker could have corrected MOST of this."
1,Mistaken Identity,"Just a note, the 5 star review mentions ""Mark"" doing a great job ... Neither author of this book is named Mark, so me thinks this 5 star review was for Mark Minasi's W2K book ... Just a thought ..."
5,I wholeheartedly recommend this book.,"I am an NT administrator and technical trainer trying to quickly get up to speed with Windows 2000 Server. Mark's book is just the ticket. Let's face it- the guy not only knows the product backwards, forwards, and diagonally, but he knows how to TEACH the relevant concepts.In summary, the book is purposely structured to be of maximum benefit to people with or without prior knowledge of Windows NT. Current Windows NT experts will doubtless learn some new pointers about NT as they learn brand new stuff about Windows 2000. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."
5,Great summary of the CIA's accomplishments...,"Just a quick overview of 50 CIA operations without much detail, but great anyone who hasn't been informed about what the CIA does. If you want more detailed info check out some of the references or seek the truth yourself, if it hasn't already been buried completely by the powers that be."
5,CIA isn't as bad as you think,"Although this books displays some of the CIA's mistakes, keep notice that the CIA isn't allowed to say what it has done that is helpful. The intelligence business means the only publicity you get is negative. When they screw up, you hear about it. When they do good, its secret. I'm sick of you bastards disrespecting the Agency. Come on, you don't know everything they do so just leave them be."
1,Disrespectful,"If I could rate this a 0 I would. Like Deckard mentioned below, much of the CIA's accomplishments can't be talked about or printed in the news media. And, like most news anymore, they only tend to focus on the mistakes. The CIA may have (and had) its downfalls and errors, but show some respect for the men that died serving their country.Check out 'The Book of Honor' by Ted Gup if you want a worth while read."
4,Used it on my Cobra,"Put this on my Terminator Cobra and it has run fine, no slipping on the blower side of things. I would buy this again."
4,Love the action,My husband liked this movie so much I gave it to him for Father's day. Held out attention and enjoy special effects
3,it could be better,"think ""blackhawk down"" plus ""independance day"" without any of will smith's silliness. the alien invaders dont seem very formidable considering they came here from somewhere else.its watchable, but not more than once."
4,Fun Action Flick,"It's a popcorn flick, plain and simple. It worked for ID4, and it works again here.Not a lot of thought put into the script, and not a lot of acting from the cast, despite having heavy weight Aaron Eckhart who was most likely the sole reason for a fair number of folk to sit down and watch the flick in the first place.Don't get me wrong, the visuals are pretty cool, and there's a range of behind the scenes goodness that isn't boring to sit through. It simply wasn't the massive epicness folk wanted it to be - it plays like Halo without the Master Chief. So it's not a bad film. Just don't expect award-winning anything from it, turn off your brain, and watch the explosions."
4,A solid action scifi movie,"I liked this movie. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be a solid action film with a scifi subject. I mean, its nothing ground-breaking... but it is a well crafted couple hours."
4,"No fluff, just action","Just watched it last night and don't know how anyone could not like it. Other than missing a larger than life sound track like in Independence Day this was an excellent movie. Independence Day was a good movie, but you felt manipulated to cry at just the right times. This movie was more like reality even though they were fighting aliens. I enjoyed the extra featurettes also."
2,Disrespect and Mockery of Troops in Middle East,"This is a way to make war seem cool for kids as marines battle against some aliens. This is what its like in the middle east except peoples heads, guts, and limbs are getting blown to pieces. A slap in the face for marines who really have to live this against other people. Those who died and suffer should not have their efforts twisted into some alien recruiting film towards teenagers that this corrupt government wants to ship out to war.Whats worse is the people in the middle east have to live this kind of ravaging warfare in their homelands as their homes are destroyed and children bombed. Hollywood has stumped to a new low."
2,just not as good as expected,"OK, its a SciFi, but it's a pretty bad one. Some special effects are OK, but mostly it is just not a very good movie. Story starts interesting but that's about all.the next day you dont remember, that is how much impact this movie has on a scifi lover. What was that again?? Just OK."
3,Hey Mikey - I liked it!,"Did it break new ground? Nope. Was I blown away? Nope. Did I enjoy the 2 hours of escapism? Yup! Take it for what it is - a movie with good actors, a mediocre story line, and lots of action... then just enjoy!"
4,good action flic,"It lived up to my expectations. Some of the scenes are prdictable,you might even say cliche, but it had some good pyrotechnic shots."
4,Good movie but....,"Nothing pisses me off more than watching a movie depicting Marine Staff NCO's with bad haircuts calling senior staff by their first name while in uniform. Obviously the director had no clue about the etiquette of the Marine ranks. I know this is just a movie, but if you are going to depict Marines, do it right. Don't make them look like Army; it just ain't right. And yes I know my stuff, I was a Staff Sergeant in the USMC myself. Never once did I call a Master Gunnery Sergeant by his first name, I don't care how long I served with him."
2,"Action, but where's the story","This movie had potential but the depth wasn't there. The action was good though, and some decent character development going on with those jarheads. But needless to say all this was was a shoot em up bang bang movie. No storyline, no overarching plot besides running around shooting. I thought this could be a sneaky movie that would grab my attention and I would come away saying wow that one surprised me. But unfortunately that did not happen...think the creators of this were shooting to create a District 9 cult type film, and well they fell flat on their face with this one. If you want a decent and recent sci-fi flick that is worth it detour to District 9 its much better and the story is much more grasping."
3,Great alien Invasion Flick !!!,Another alien invasion'flick for my collection... is a great movie.. look like a documentary... I can't tell you much... you must watch it !!!
5,Action packed,"Fun mvie to watch if you are into Sci-Fi along with the military application component of the movie. Special effects are cool along with an interesting story line. I found myself renting it several times, realizing that I should buy it instead."
2,This movie needs a remake,"Poor portrayal of Marines shaking in their boot with bombs and bullets flying around them. If I was the producer of this movie I would go to the front lines in Afghanistan and watch how real Marines behave. Too much camera shaking going on. Hollywood needs to understand about this. Other than that it's the same old ""bad aliens come to earth to conquer and kill humans"" movie. I've seen it before."
3,"Definitely not as entertaining as War of the Worlds, but decent","For anyone who enjoys a nice popcorn-eating action movie in the theaters, I would recommend this. It was far from War of the Worlds in terms of acting, entertainment, story, etc; but it's definitely worth watching if you're like me and those alien invasion-type movies entertain you. Without spoiling the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, I must say that it seemed very ""empty"" by the ending, and seemed to have left out a lot of other key subjects in the movie. That's why it's not a 4-star or 5-star movie in my option. I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could though, as I enjoyed it, but have definitely seen better movies.But I must say, that this movie deserves a lot better of critic reviews from Rottentomatoes. It really isn't as bad as some critics perceive it to be."
1,GOOD GRIEF!,"Ok, I wasn't expecting a deep film here and actually for the first 40 minutes I was interested, but then it turns into a ham fest with ridiculous overacting and heroic patriotism that is shoved down your throat like a greasy ""A $$ burger"" straight out of a fast food chain in South Park! Sure it's got explosions, but not one character is interesting and everyone is made of cardboard. The aliens are kind of uninteresting too. I caught this on cable, so it didn't cost me anymore than my time, which it wasn't worth taking.If you want to see a cheese fest done right, watch Armageddon(very entertaining), which is at least fun while being overblown!"
2,Too dizzy.,Stereotypical Hollywood view of soldiers. Stereotypical but effective. Excessive camera movement. Background noises so loud you can't follow the dialogue. Backstory - almost incomprehensible.Special effects were top notch. Aaron Eckhart's performance although given boilerplate lines straight out of a bad John Wayne movie - was quite good.It certainly had potential. Blame the director.
4,What do you expect for an Action Flick.,"Not bad. It is a decent action flick. Acting is Fair, what do you expect for an action flick. I could repeat that over and over but again.... It has taken some time to mature my appreciation of cinema. Within each genre, not everything needs to make perfect sense."
5,Great movie,This movie while like Independence Day involves a Rise from the ashes it defers greatly. In this movie in is from the ground forces point of view instead of a pilot and scientist. In my opinion it is the most realistic alien invasion movie I have yet seen.
3,It's OK....but just OK,This movie does remind me a lot of Independence Day with its simple plot and the shallow character development. The camera work is quite jerky at times to a point of distraction. I'm glad I rented it during a discount weekend and I probably won't be watching it again anytime soon.
4,Fun Movie; Great Score,"This was quite enjoyable. Nothing new from a story side, but well acted for an alien action movie and a great musical score."
1,Move! Move!! Move!!!,"Awful. 2 hours of yelling. Cardboard characters. Predictable beginning, middle, and end. Non-stop melodramatic music (to dictate to the viewer how he or she should feel.) No more than a paragraph of meaningful dialouge and no, I am not being hyperbolic. The ""movie"" was, essentialy, like watching someone else play a sci-fi video game for 120 minutes. Even as an exercise in escapism-this movie failed. The cliches were so over-used as to be insulting to the viewer. There was zero attempt by the writer(s)/ director to make this into anything more than an extended preview of, well, any given CGI riddled train wreck. You could literally watch this movie without the sound on and you would miss nothing of its plot. Save your money."
1,IDIOTIC At The Very Least . . . . .,"Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have any imagination anymore. The same old lame special effects, the same tired characters, the same old explosions, the same old same old. I love a good Sci-Fi movie, or any type of good movie, but this stinker is one of the worst. Put it in the same category as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Super dumb !!!!!"
1,Worst digital download EVER,Got the digital download and its at 480i? Wow! First time I've actually paid for a movie and the last time I'll pay for a digital download.
1,SERVICE VERY BAD,"The movie did not play. When I contacted goHastings, they said they cannot replace it because more than 30 days passed. I thought they stood by their products. I was wrong. I will look for other retailers next time."
1,This.Was.Awful.,"Some films are void of all merit. You want to find something worthy of your time within them, but they just rest there like the complete failure that they are. I wasn't expecting something great from `Battle: Los Angeles' but I was expecting something. Instead, what I got was a halfbaked attempt at infusing a science fiction, alien film with a war mentality. There are a slew of characters all layered with `real life issues' and yet none of them feel even remotely `real'. They are all empty and soulless and `who really cares' and yet, this film thinks that it is saying something important. I hate when a film thinks it is saying more than it really is. This film desperately wanted to be `District 9', or at least capitalize on its success, but it lacked so much of the formers rooted realism. Instead, `Battle: Los Angeles' tosses balance out the window and meanders so long that it becomes a boring, pointless, misguided waste of time. In the wise words of my Ammy Twin; ""GOOD GRIEF!"""
1,I WISH I COULD GIVE IT NEGATIVE STARS...,"THIS MOVIE, IN A WORD, SUCKED. NOT ONLY WAS IT BORING, AND NOT GETTING TO THE POINT FAST ENOUGH, THE SHAKING CAMERA REALLY, REALLY BOTHERED ME. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, IT CURES INSOMNIA!"
1,blah...,"Boring..aliens just the catalyst of the drama..uninteresting..please take the time to read the negative reviews as well as the overly gushing positive ones..you have seen this story time and time again..only better told..seems to me just a big pump up movie for the military...thought it would be good..and I love invasion and military movies..nope..this is not it..poor characters..I could care less as each one dies..half the time I didn't even realize who died....poor dialogue...seems like the tried to force blackhawk down and independence day together..but in a way more cheesy and cheap way..had high hopes..let down..can't even say mindless action movie..cause none of the ""action"" was that exciting..skip it..."
1,What a waste of talent,"This is going to be a very short review.. The story is weak from all the imitations, which made it very predictable.It has bits & pieces from the following movies:- Independence Day- War of the WorldsHow many movies have you seen of an alien attack with one Marines unit kicking them off the planet? Not to mention the gaps in its storyline, which makes one go 'Huh?! How.. What did I miss?' One unit thinks and acts better than all international brains put together.. A waste of talent, time, and money."
1,So boring!,So I watched this movie last week and I was looking forward to it. I could NOT keep track of all the freaking characters there was way too many for a movie where you rarely can see their faces and mostly see the uniform their wearing which are all the exact same. And I just couldn't get into it. So I turned it off forty minutes into it.
4,Generally good at what it is supposed to be,"There were a couple of horrific boners - the worst was ""They have come to steal our water, noplace else in the universe has free water"". I wish they had asked anybody that had an IQ above hat size about that one. Mostly, the special effect were first rate. The thing about making a big smoke ring just before crashing into the ocean was a little weird, but Hollywood always does something stupid and unneccessary. The marines were mostly realistic."
4,"A shoot em up movie, not really much with aliens stuff.","If you like shoot em up movie this movies fits the bill. I was disappointed though that not much more alien views ,or stuff was really there at all. I liked Skyline much better, and I hope they do a Skyline 2. Aaron Eckhardt however, did a fairly good acting bit, in this movie."
2,Cheesy dialogue,It is action-packed (allot of gun-fire) but the lines are cheesy and it just lacks the over-all appeal to me. Not really worth watching...
3,No era lo que yo esperaba,Cuando vi las características del la película decía que venia con el beta de Resistance 3 y fue esa la razón de la compra pero no venia tal demo así que deberían quitar esa característica del objeto porque uno se confía.
3,Could of Loved it.,"I would of loved this movie only for one thing the terrible filming. It gave me a head ache, the zooming and unzooming for no reason the panning of the camera so fast the picture is to blurie to see. Lets not forget the shacking of the camera. I understand the director wanted use to fell close to the action but GD way to much and why did he zoom in on everyones faces. The actions was really good in some parts. But I wish they would of went it to more depth on the aliens and I thought Aaron Eckhart did a good job, he was believable as the battle tough Marine."
5,"This was like Independence Day,.... ON CRACK!","This made Independence Day look like the Flintstones. I was so enthralled and entertained by thisI !Despite the fact that this had no a list stars, this movie was awesome upon awesome!I want more alien movies like this."
2,Blowing Up Los Angeles,"That's what it should have been called. Did you know this movie actually had a writer. I'm not sure why, there aren't but more than ten lines of dialogue. Every character has exactly one dimension and most serve as ""red shirts"" or target practice for the aliens that are stealing our water or using our water as fuel or doing something related to our water. Who really cares why the aliens came 200 gazillion trillion miles, maybe they were just mighty thirsty. It was fun mindless (MINDLESS must be emphasized) explosion after crazy explosion. Blowing Up Los Angeles!"
2,Mindless Action,"Most Sci-Fi epics require suspension of disbelief. That's a given. But please! Aliens cross interstellar space in mighty ships to annihilate earth's occupants and suck up earth's water. A Marine platoon faces off against them in L.A. After a seemingly endless series of tedious battles between a few gung-ho soldiers and the aliens, the aliens lose? They're on the run? Get real. Marines are tough, but my advice to them under the circumstances: Bend over, grab your ankles and kiss your a** goodbye.Silly story, decent special effects. If all you're looking for is mindless action, then this is the movie for you."
4,Good movie,"This is a really good movie, so much better than what most people say. The action is great, and there isn't any of that needless love drama that a lot of movies try to pull off. The characters are good and so is the story (although the story is mostly ""kill alien""). Yeah I'd recommend this movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,Better Than Expected,"After Reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much from this movie- but my expectations were exceeded! Movie started out slow so characters could be built up (without wasting too much time as it is a action flick after all), but it also helped so the viewer wasn't desensitized to the violence/action. Movie had a Black Hawk Down feeling to it but not as fast in the beginning so you could get into the movie first."
3,Battle: Los Angeles [Blu-ray],"Movie doesn't break any ground in the alien taking over the world action genre, but it is still entertaining none the less with special affects. just don't expect anything deep here & you wont be disappointed."
3,Well...,"I bought this movie because I did not get to see it at the theater, or on pay per view. While mildly entertaining, and of course as stated, predictable. I guess I expected more. The premise was good, and the aliens were tough as you might actually expect them to be. To me it shows that actors can make or break a movie. The new Lt. is a dork (as seen in Transformers 2), and the guy playing the lead cannot carry a lead role in a movie. Gee, why didnt we give the control sticks of the helicopter to the lady from Avatar? I give it 3 stars, not bad to watch...but dont buy it, it will collect dust in your collection."
5,Battle Los Angeles,"Great movie. It doesn't try to be something it's not; it's simply a great action movie. it doesn't try to take the moral high ground to deliver some message. It doesn't descend into some kiddie show where a bunch of U8's save the world. It's just a great ""popcorn"" movie. Having said that my one criticism of the movie is the cliché of the heroes being marines. It's always either marines, green berets, etc. Never a bunch of average enlisted personnel from any branch of the armed services.The blu-ray is great. The picture is second to none. The sound overall is good, although i did find at times the talking was a little quiet but that may be due to my sound setup and not the disc itself.I try not to over analyse movies. I try and judge each movie on its own merits. I tend to watch movies for the escapism and this review should be considered in this light.I hope you find this review helpful."
3,Be careful if you're getting this for R3 Demo,"I haven't watched the Movie yet - The reason I bought the Blu-ray is for theResistance 3 Game Demo Hybrid - PS3 Game indicated on the Special features. Either I'm a Moron [Because the Theme was on there and I'm just not 'FINDING IT'] or it's NOT included on this 'version'. I shot an email to Amazon, cause if it's on a separate disc they can just send it. I just wanted those like me to hold up til we get clarification.Battle: Los Angeles [Blu-ray]"
5,Much better than expected,"From a military standpoint, this movie is great. The dialog was exactly what I expected. I admit that it was kind of like Independence Day, but that's not exactly a bad thing.Camera is a little shaky at times, but it's fitting when it is. The visual effects are good/decent or on par with movies of today.People who are complaining about the Dialog...what did you expect? It's a pure action movie and they did great on at that."
3,All hands on deck.,"defend the homeland,What if something like this movies portraial of something or someone trying to help theirselves to uor resources.I've done that sort of thing for decades."
3,Battle On!,This movie in blu ray looks very good. The story held my interest. It never got to cornball at least for me. Alot of cool fireballs and crashes. Best part for me was the battle on the freeway with the bus. This is a rental! If you need a blu ray to show off blu ray then buy it.
4,"Good Movie, Good Special Features, Good Bluray",Not the best story or the best dialog but i loved it. I thought it looked stunning with its documentary style grittiness and what i think was visually stimulating. Best alien invasion movie of its time. (not like those retarded movies like Skyline)
3,Not Bad!,"There was good action, but it seemed more like a recuitment film for the Marines. If the price is right, it's OK for your library."
2,"Arghhhh, what is with the shaky cam","Good lord, when will the hand held shaky cam go the hell away. My hate for this type of cinematography again triumphs enjoying any project that might otherwise be good. But Battle Los Angeles is not that good. It never delivers on the necessary money shots. You never really get a good look at the aliens or the alien ships. There is so much chaos going on with shaky cam and at such a distance, it just becomes a blur of activity. I've watched my son play video games and that's what this movie mostly emulates. I will give the props up for probably the most explosions ever in a flick, but I'm not sure I'd really recommend this movie."
3,"Not quite the ""Battle Los Angeles"" I was expecting.","When I first heard about this film, I thought it sounded really cool, despite being familiar. But when I saw the final product, I couldn't help but find it to being lower than my expectations. ""Battle: Los Angeles"" took itself way too seriously, when it should've been fun, exciting, and entertaining. And I'm proud to call myself an Action movie junkie, but I personally expected more and better from this film. I guess for this generation if I want to see an alien invasion film where the military goes to war with them (particlarly if they're robots, like the one in this film), I'll just have to settle for Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" film for the time being. Say what you will, but at least ""Transformers"" never took itself too seriously; and it was better than this."
3,Movie is fair,"Not up to par, expected more. Action is good, but aliens aren't shown up close and are only in the movie for a few minutes."
3,Just Another Alien Movie,"There is a lot of action and special effects in this movie and that is all good. The plot is super simple, the aliens come from space to invade the Earth, and the military responds to their attack.It is little boring in that nothing much else happens in this movie. For example, the 'District 9' was interesting because it was an unusual take on alien movies. The Independence Day had very good special effects and also it was at times funny. The special effects in this movie are not as refined.** SPOILER BELOW **After the invasion starts a platoon is assigned to rescue civilians from attacked zones and bring them into a Forward Operating Base, however when they finally get there they find that it is all destroyed. They proceed to find the alien Command Control Center and destroy it saving the Day.If you really like lots of action, you will like this movie. If you are impartial to it, then I would skip this one."
5,WOW!!!!!!!,The package arrived in less that one standard week and the disk was immiculate and the viewing was blazing!!! I have viewed the show two times since receiving it and have found new things in the background and some spoken dialog which give more insite into the overall experience!!!!!David.
3,Battle: Los Angeles,Overall the Blue Ray movie works great and I am happy with my purchase. The only thing I'm dissapointed with is the movie did not come with a digital copy but in the sellers defense they never said it did. I just assumed that it did because that seems to be the norm when I buy blue rays anymore.
3,Poor at times,"Unrealistic. Trained soldiers do not behave that way. Hollywood actors acting in a low budget movie act that way. You don't walk around with the scope view on, you only zoom in once you see the enemy. And it is difficult to hit targets if both you and they are moving, even if you have them in scope - you need to kneel with your rifle, stand, lie face down or stabilize it on any object you can find. Google shooting positions. You need to crouch and peek around corners first before entering rooms. You can't rush into rooms shouting ""US marines"", ""US marines"". The soldiers talked and shouted to each other during combat! No scouting, plus they rarely hid behind obstacles... $78m. Get professional soldiers to help advise you. The movie was somewhat better from 40min and on."
2,Too much military/war movie not enough sci-fi,I had heard good things about this film and was yet again disappointed. I like sci-fi movies but this was more like watching a military/war movie and less like watching a sci-fi film. If you like war movies with a little twist of sci-fi then this is for you. Otherwise stick to watching Saving Private Ryan for good war movie or War of the Worlds or Cloverfield for traditional alien/monster mashup. The last sci-fi film I truly adored was Cloverfield - that was a movie that's part of our collection to watch and re-watch. Battle Los Angeles won't make our movie collection. Last time we made a mistake by listening to critics when District 9 came out - we bought the DVD thinking it would be great and it was terrible. Battle Los Angeles we rented and is at least better than District 9 but not what I was looking for in a sci-fi flick.
3,Good movie!,Pretty cool special effects and action scenes. Some of them are just too long though. It would have been better if the director left about 1/2hour in the cutting room...including the scenes about the civilian family.
3,battle la packs a punch,I was pumped to see this when i first saw the trailer and although it didnt quite deliver on the extraordinarily high standard set for itself in the trailer i still enjoyed every minute of it and was genuinely riveted at times. First rate action and effects coupled with a breath taking pace makes for great fun. A must for war and action buffs. If i had one complaint it would be a little lack of creativity in terms of the aliens themselves who you rarely get a good look at. Other than that pretty damn fun.
2,Independence Day + District 9,"Hollywood actors, upset by alien bullies, dress up like soldiers, go where they shouldn't, give away their positions, waste thousands of rounds, have tantrums, and generally get into lots of trouble before eventually turning the tide by taking out the enemy's space-hog network server.You sense that a fair amount of money went into this movie, but it's mainly stuff blowing up. The plot and interaction of the 'soldiers' is so unreal that the aliens are more interesting. The dialogue is so trite that my girlfriend got the giggles and annoyed some students sitting nearby in the theatre. The camera tremors are so bad that another good title would be ""JIGGLE: Los Angeles.""The explosions are convincing. If you like lots and lots of shooting and hollering and very large scale urban renewal, check it out."
1,Brainless,"A total waste of time and money. Absolutely brainless. Smoke and automatic weapon fire, yelling and that's it. Really. That's IT for 90 minutes."
1,Not really worth the time and cost,"We generally like the sci-fi action type movies, but this one just never really got going and seemed to be just too ""out there"" for our tastes."
2,The worst movie I've not finished in a long time,"I've owned it for weeks, still have not been interested enough to finish itWait until you can watch it free ...!!!"
3,Is there a purpose for buying this in Blu-Ray?,After watching this movie in the theater I found no reason to buy this movie in Blu-Ray. Makes no sense to make a HD movie and then shake thecamera the whole time for effect. Hollywood needs to find a better way to stress action than the 1940's effect of shaking the camera. I won't even buy this as a regular DVD for this reason. It is really too bad because the movie had a great premise and great writing. Shows what a bad director can do to a good movie.
3,Ok But Kinda Boring,This movie is a stripped down version of Resistance Fall of Man + Black Hawk Down + District 9. The Prawns from District 9 come back to take all the food from our cats. They bring the Angels borrowed from the Chimeran this time. Angels means trouble! The retiring solder is being pulled back for duty. And you know the rest.I think this is an ok movie if you don't ask for too much drama.
1,GOD! WHAT A BAD MOVIE!,"I really don't understand the 5 stars.One of the worst movie of the year.No emotion at all. You care less for the characters.The music didn't help at all. Very bad score and so heavy.Why? because the army?, the GI's?, the Marines?, the War?Sorry but other composers treated army subject with more class.This ""movie"" is very noisy for nothing. Some special effects but that's it.It really looks like a bad VideoGame.The script is so stupid. Ex: You don't make noise when you're surrounded by Aliens.GI's yelling all the time ""GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO GO"". It's 90% of the entire dialog.There are so many incoherence.If you don't believe me, rent it first before buying it."
1,Effective remedy for insomnia,"Shaky picture from hand-held camera will give you gentle nausea. Complete smorgasboard of politically correct characters will give you a warm and fuzzy assurance of things being under full control. Lack of plot will slow down and soothe your train of thought. And the sound of relentlessly steady gunfire will lullaby you to deep sleep.Night-night, everybody..."
1,One of the POOREST MOVIES ever,"This movie has NO PLOT, the lousy EFX are repeated the entire film and there are NO actors or characters. The responsible financiers at SONY must have frozen to ICE when they saw the results of the crew the first time. It was the first movie ever where I needed three seats in the movie theatre. It was easier for me to sleep. Absolute trash and even NOT this. Donate your money to PETA or light your cigarettes with it! If I could give canyon-deep ""-10-points"" I would rate it that way."
1,Perhaps Watchable as a Comedy,"After reading enough good reviews and having a liking for any kind of war flick, I decided to buy the film at my local Walmart. Since I watched the film in my living room, I could not walk out. Battle: Los Angeles is not a film as much as a video game, with video sequences that repeat in intent if not literally so, and audio and dialogue that DOES repeat. Often. Couple that with a lame minimalistic storyline and incredibly bad acting, and you have one of the worst films in a long time. If you are a fan of the original SF war film Starship Troopers, as I am, you will be sorely disappointed in this work which borrows extensively from better films such as Independence Day, War of the Worlds, District 9, and even Skyline. Not that it doesn't have some interest for film students. If you are fan of Avid film editing you will enjoy taking the sequences apart to see how modern editing can make something out of nothing. But for the rest of us, there are much better choices."
1,"yet another dumb movie, this could have been really good","I only watched this show because of Eckhart, I have really enjoyed his films in the past, but this was a very pedestrian performance. The sad thing is that a team of well trianed monkeys could have made a better screen play, the dialogue was pretty much cut and pasted from the other hundred thousand war movies. Same old regurgitated crap."
1,stupid,"Wish I could give it more stars- I like Eckhart, but this movie is not good. Just a remake ofIndependance Day. The movie just stays on the same track of killing aliens (nothing exciting)."
1,avoid at all cost,"This is by far one of the worst movies of the year. Horrible story, cardboard characters, confusing action, and laughable acting. My 12 year old son nearly fell asleep, it was so boring. The only thing that kept us interested was the fun of correctly guessing which stupid line of dialogue the actors would spit out next. People need to stop supporting these kinds of insulting time and money wasters. I know I'll never watch another movie by this director."
3,Very entertaining and lots of fun,"If hostile aliens invaded Earth, this is what it would be like! Or at least it might be like this. Look, this film is no deep intellectual exercise. It is a rip-roaring story with great special effects about the US Military defending Los Angeles against a ruthless alien invasion. There is a solid story here, and I was pleased to discover that this film held my interest at all times -- something that many films these days fail to do. The aliens looked plausible and real, and the troops acted pretty true-to-life--they were not caricatures as too many combat flicks sometimes portray. This one is recommended. RJB."
4,Battle: Los Angeles,"It would be easy to pick apart the technical faults of the movie (hundreds of rounds to kill an alien until they find it's soft spot and then one shot kills? Too much chatter while moving...), but why bother? The movie is very enjoyable and the action believable.I thought most of the characters were fairly well developed. Definitely worth watching."
2,This Movie is worth rental at best,"To be clear, I am only reviewing the film itself, not the blu ray. In my opinion unless this is priced at $12.99 or less, its not worth purchasing. I saw this film in the theater was disappointed. I did not go to see it with overly high expectations, just wanted a good sci fi action film. However the film's weak plot, and corny dialogue constantly drown out all the cool action scences, and the film quickly became annoying. I am in the military and have served proudly for over 8 years, so I enjoyed the fact the movie was specifically about one marine unit trying to survive this alien invasion. Unfortunately, I feel that the movie was geared to be more of a marine recruiting film, than an epic sci fi action film. Overall, not the worst film, but nothing that left me with a wow. Its an average film, that you as the buyer have to ask yourself if its worth purchasing"
2,forgetable Battle,"Battle: Los Angeles is two hours I wish I had gotten back. It is a gritter War of the Worlds type miltary type battle.Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Two Face from The Dark Knight) does an impressive job of spitting out ham-fisted dialogue like he really, really means it in a John Wayne type mode. He is the highlight of the whole film. His Marine Staff Sergeant headed to the way of retirement may be the only reason you may want to watch this film. Otherwise, the Poor character development and a worn out storyline make this a very forgettable film otherwise.Charlie's Angels Ramon Rodriguez and Lost's Michelle Rodriquez seem wasted in their supporting roles.The humans vs Aliens type storyline seem weak. I blame the story, not the filmmaker. However, the film is so gritty that you cannot keep up who is who.I suggest you miss this BattleBennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD"
4,"The Movie is Great, the DVD is ANNOYING!","This is the first DVD I've had in ages that won't let you start watching the movie until you've watched a commercial for Sony, followed by a string of previews for Sony DVD releases. I must have pressed every menu and skip button on the remote a dozen times to no effect. The irony is that it I was playing it on a Sony Blu-Ray player that advertised a special feature button to ""bypass those annoying previews"" that Sony seems to have disabled for their own DVD products. I don't count this against the movie, but it's going to make me think twice about rewatching the movie, and I probably won't recommend that other people buy it."
4,Very enjoyable and fun movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. I seldom watch a movie a 2nd time within 24 hours of seeing it but this one I did. The lead actor was superb in his role, his acting was very good. And Michelle Rodriguez, I could watch all day, she's great. Several of the other soldiers also did a great job of acting. The script in places was sophomoric but some marines and army rangers I knew were just like that in real life. The aliens and their weapons were great, the scenes of a destroyed LA was great, and it had a great ending. I look forward to a directors cut with more footage. Was it ""Gone with the Wind"" or something, no it wasn't, but it was still a good movie."
2,Another alien invasion flick!?,"In a word, this movie is ANOTHER cgi driven, alien invasion, battle flick. Nothing new to see here, move along. While I like the main character, he was not quite what I envision is a marine sergeant killing the baddies, especially when the baddies are outta this world. So, the movie bogged down in places, upon which I promptly fell asleep. Further, some of the one liners were so cliche they were almost offensive. If you want an alien invasion flick, ID still does nicely. This movie doesn't get close to ID's standard."
2,Thumbs down on this movie!,"I am glad I did not pay money to watch this junk Hollywood keeps churning out sinker after sinker.The plot was so poor I had to stop and watching it over several days 10 mins here 25 there. Acting and movie's pace was way to fast. The alien bad guys just like Aliens, Independence day and all the rest of them never do find out were they come from. I am being kind when I give it a 2 stars. It could have been better and as the kids say producers need a do over."
3,worth $4,"In the comfort of your own home. The previews got me hyped for some serious alien interaction that never comes and we know pretty soon exactly how the bitches will be defeated. I wouldn't be surprised if this film got some dosh from the armed forces, it'll make you want to join the marines within the first 19 minutes, if you didn't want to already. I have to note that Eckhart is impressive as a soul-crushed soon-to-be-retired-but-ha!-not-yet commander, and I could never tell if the cold glint in his eyes was CGI or actually, well, acting. But there's great explosions and it's left open for a sequel in which a young Hispanic man leads the rebellion against the ruthless, faceless aliens who killed his sweet dad 10 years earlier. But, y'know, maybe not, especially because that Spielberg pic coming out looks AWESOME. Let's look forward to that, shall we?"
1,Sucked,"This movie just plain sucked ! Cheep special effects, and poor acting .Don't waste your time on this movie unless you like the old 60's B/W syfy. This makes the original Star Trek show look like Avatar !"
3,not one of the best,I watched this several times to see if I could pick up some parts of the story line I may have missed the first time.It helped but not enough to keep me glued to it.
2,Not believable in the slightest,"another completely ridiculous film. some good scenesmany bad ones, good effects, gone astray. you still needa story and a writer to make a good movie, even thoughyou would think the producers dont care."
4,Daughter liked it,I bought this for my daughter who had requested it. She was happy to get it and has watched it already. Now she and her Dad have to find time to watch it together.
5,AMAZING,"Imagine a war movie, but with alies, black hawk down meets aliens, its just awesome, its a realistic survival war catastrophe movie. very good."
5,Great Disc,"Outstanding quality blu-ray disc. The movie itself: loads of action, aliens, and a great cast of characters. Although entirely fictitious, I appreciate the representation of the soldiers as self-sacrificing for others."
2,Very Bad SciFi Movie,"If you are looking for a great SciFi movie, like for example: Independence Day, Battle: Los Angeles, is not it. It is more of a war movie fought in and around Santa Monica, Ca. The camera moves too fast to let your eyes focus on the picture. Almost like a reality show. The ""aliens"" resemble somewhat the robot character in Terminator, hard to knock down. The story seems to have been written very fast and with no thought given to allow enough time to a prelude to an earth invasion. What can I say, the acting is so, so, the story even worse. By the way, the movie, seems to be somewhat of a copycat of the other scifi movie failure called: Skyline. Choose carefully, before wasting money and time in watching something that is not appealing to real scifi fans."
3,Action Packed,"This movie is filled with non-stop action, but was not all that exciting to watch. Most of the movie is very loud, to the point where you cannot hear the voices of the actors. It does live up to it's name, it is one long battle. This is one movie that I could have waited until it came out on cable to watch. The battle could have been more interesting. I kept waiting for it to get better."
3,Nothing new but could be enjoyable.,"This movie is not bad, it's just that it really lacks any kind of substance or originality. The best way that I can recommend this movie would be if you are the kind of person who likes action movies with great special effects and somewhat cliche depictions of marines, I would not hesitate to recommend it, You will love it. If you're the kind of person who strives for a little more in your flicks, new ideas, deep thinking, intelligent dialogue, you won't find it here. This is a straight action humans vs. aliens movie with very little attention focused on who the aliens are or what they are doing on earth, the soldiers seem completely unimpressed by them as well, like seeing an alien is a regular occurrence for them. Not my thing but I know there are people out there that will enjoy this."
5,"Wouldn't win Oscars, but so entertaining.","I watched this movie twice in theaters, despite its bad reviews. I have to say I'm a bit puzzled as to what critics were expecting when they saw this. Saving Private Ryan? Black Hawk Down? I'm sorry, the movie is just not that deep. Does it make the movie bad? Not even remotely.It's a little cliche, a little overacted, and contains a little too much bravado. Last I checked, these are all on the checklist for being a Marine. It's a fun, thrilling ride, full of action, and it's just plain entertaining.Not into that sort of thing? Prefer to stick to your thought-provoking Oscar nominees? That's fine, keep walking. If you want an exciting bit of entertainment, you can do much, MUCH worse than this movie."
4,Overly Priced!,Great Movie! I got this tin box set for $24.96 from Walmart. How can these people charge so much here at AMAZON?
4,battle los angeles,Good movie! shipping fast!Kept me interested through out movie till girl friend walk in front of me with new thonghad to put on pause..
2,Battle: Overdone in LA,"I thought some of the scenes were amazing but I wasn't ready for the blow by blow visuals that got tiring after 45-60 minutes of the same thing over and over. A few scenes were fun to watch. Acting was so-so, not really there for me.Glad I didn't have to pay $12 to see this, that WOULD'VE been overkill!!!"
2,battle; los angeles,"will, where do i start , i throught the movie was sooo boring and stuiped, all that money for a $6 movie thats what it will go for next yr.THE camra is all ways shaking up-down poorly made movie. So if any one is looking to buy this movie DON;T, it sucks................"
5,Awesome Movie!!,"This movie was Great! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. You could feel the brotherhood of the men, it was so real in the emotion, that you forget that this is a ""Sci-Fi"" movie and you focus on the characters and there mission. I am going to watch it again just to see the things I missed the first time. 100 times better than Independence Day... Just an all around Awesome movie!!!!"
3,Low budget Independence Day,Just another version of Independence Day but cheaper made.You will watch it once and stick it on the shelf to collect dust.So rent it don't buy it.
5,battle los angeles,you see the battle from the view point of the marines. which is great. i think you'll enjoy this flim.
3,Could have been done better,Could have been done better. As it is I didn't get immersed into the show like movies such as Independance day.
4,Very good,A good Sci Fi movie with marines in it kicking butt. At first it was sort of chaotic. Camera moving alot sort of like cloverfield hard to follow but it slowed down and turn out to be very good.
3,Almost Good,"This film follows a group of marines through a war torn LA during an alien invasion. Although I have to give it credit for trying to inject some character development and realism into the standard alien invasion flick, I found myself slightly dissatisfied after finishing the film. There was nothing about the movie that was done badly. There was just so little originality that I felt like I had already watched it. You got your slew of marines ala Aliens. You got your District 9 mixed with V aliens. Throw in some Independence Day and Band and Brothers and voila! Battle Los Angeles. You won't feel like you've thrown your money away renting it, but this is not a flick you will remember in ten years. In fact, you'll probably forget it by this Christmas."
2,Average at best,After seeing a few of the trailers for this movie I really was hoping that it was better than it turned out being. We both found this movie boring and predictable. I persoanlly thought this was Michelle Rodriguez's worst role that I can remember seeing her in. I will go on to say that we appeared to be in the minority as quite a few people were clapping at the end of it.
2,camera motion sickness,"they have movies with 3D and non 3D theatres. They should have movies with excessive camera shaking and normal camera movement theatres. I sat and sat watching and oh man it was good with the action and special effects, but wow, i went to bed that night with sore eyeballs. The camera shook so much it was ridiculous. Even before the action started two men talking at a desk looked like drunk camera. I dont mind hand held cameras like those used in the tv show 24. It was just terrible in this movie. Aaron Eckhart did a good job, but too bad the director or director of photography ruined the final product."
2,"A big-budget, feature-length recruiting poster for the Marines","First part put together as a pseudo-documentary, last part as action film.Not much plot, cheesy dialog, expensive-looking special effects, and 100% unknown-to-me actors. Anything that doesn't involve shooting things or blowing things up reveals the cliched shallowness of this film.If you can bear watching a rather shallow, wooden, cliché-ridden animated recruiting poster aimed at teenage males, go for it."
2,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie but I'm sorry to say that watching an ice cube melt would've been more exhilirating. As usual when having white Liberal jackasses who are motivated by political correctness in every scene where the Marine Corps Infantry 'make up' is concerned, it was absolute B.S.! For some strange reason after watching this crappy movie I had a hankerin' for tortillas and fried chicken. As far as I'm concerned this was a wasted 16 bucks."
1,"Beware Sci-Fi fans, Battle: Los Angeles is not what it seems.","Beware Sci-Fi fans, Battle: Los Angeles is not what it seems. The film feels more like a War film than a Sci-Fi film, focusing mostly on the Marines. The Marines are walking clichés, they are constantly cursing and make pretty shallow jokes. One of the characters says such a stupid sex joke to Michelle Rodriguez's character, you see it coming from a mile a way.The film almost doesn't know what it wants to be. It is a terrible, shallow film. Don't bother watching it."
1,Don't bother! The WORST film I've seen in a long-long time,"The movie is completely disjointed; the ""story"" line is iffy (at best), the dialogue childish, trite, boring... the acting is simply horrible... should I go on? After about 40 minutes we all wanted to just turn the ""stupid thing off... PLEASE!"". But then we took a different tack and approached the whole thing as a MAJOR SPOOF. We then started enjoying the supremely bad acting, moronic dialog, barely tolerable special effects for what we assumed it was meant to be: a FARSE a COMEDY! We had a few belly splitting laugh sessions at the expense of the poor (as in pitiful) actors, but MUCH to EVERYONE'S RELIEF it finally ended. Do as you wish (in terms of purchase) but if you call me you can have my copy FOR FREE!!!"
1,TERRIBLE directing! Ever heard of a TRIPOD?,"TERRIBLE directing! Too cheap to invest in a TRIPOD? After 30 minutes I had to eject the disc. I couldn't stand any more of the blatantly obvious intentional CAMERA SHAKE. I cannot stand the idiotic trend in film making of this hand held ""effect"" of continually moving the camera around, up and down, zoom in-out, shake, shake shake. It's sad to see this tawdry television fad finding its way into big screen movies. This movie is one of the worst! Too bad,,, I don't even know if the movie otherwise has merit."
2,Battle to keep my eyes open,"The writer tried hard to press all the hero and patriot buttons, but failed to make me care about the characters. The premise was pretty stupid too. Aliens come to steal our water because it's so rare? Crack an astronomy text. I won't even address the implausibility of traveling interstellar space and then getting beaten up by hairless apes with projectile weapons. I made it through the whole thing, but just barely.I'm perfectly willing to offer up my suspension of disbelief for a story. But don't ask me to stick my head in a blender."
3,Average,"Alien invasion sci-fi flick starring Aaron Eckhart, Michelle Rodriguez and the r&b singer Ne-Yo. The plot: aliens invade the earth. In Los Angeles, marines fight the aliens. The marines have a victory. The marines then carry on fighting the aliens. And that's about it. Not a great film: indeed, I was yawning and looking at my watch whilst watching it. I felt like I was watching a computer game. Could and should have been much more. Even Skyline was better than this (apart from its ending): more suspenseful, darker, bleaker. At least you couldn't accuse Skyline of being boring. An average film. Wish I had waited for it to come out on DVD instead of forking out 8.80 for a cinema ticket."
3,Just ok?,A Independence Day remake? I wouldnt buy or rent this movie again but may watch it if it is on tv.And whats with the darting around of the camera?Ever notice how all alien attacks occure in California (in movies)LOL? Im never going to Cali. lol
1,Just Bad,This movie was vary bad - Take the most cliche elements from almost every high budget action movie shake it up in a hat drop them on the floor - randomly arrange a plot and viola you have this. Oh and throw in the exact same ending from Independence Day
1,Camel Poop,"This movie was garbage! This new generation think that so long as a movie has consecutive explosions, shootings, a cute girl (yeah, I like Michelle R.) and a bunch of dumb macho male leads you can give a movie 5 stars?! Pssssssttt! Wrong!! The plot was weak, the writing was weak, the ""acting"" was weak, did they even consult with real Marines, before making this movie. I want my money back!"
2,"Blade Roller is ""just"" ok?","Pearl Abrasive Blade Roller works great if you have plenty of surface to roll it on. It will keep the surface you are cutting from being scuffed or grooved but if you are trying to trim an edge, forget it. The wheels have to have a surface to roll on. The aluminum design is nice, it won't ever rust and it did fit the WORM DRIVE saw perfectly, I used a Skil 77 worm drive saw. I would not recommened this product becuse it is not versatile enough to use in ALL conditions."
4,A great way to prepare for Christmas!,"The activity book makes preparing for Christmas even more special by helping children put the Holiday in the proper spiritual perspective. The Christmas story is told day by day with a sticker to accompany each day narrative. The glow in the dark stickers can be reused year after year. Along with the story of the nativity, each day has a special activity or piece of holiday information, promising fun and education for the whole family.I am looking forward to using my sticker book with my own children this year and will be recommending it to the users of my web site ..."
1,Don't waste your money,"I studied Jeet Kune Do and Jun Fan under Sifu Floyd Jackson, an instructor under Dan Inosanto, and have attended seminars by Dan Inosanto, so I have firsthand experience, and this book is crap. I usually buy every Jeet Kune Do related book I find, but after going through it at our local martial arts supply store I decided it would be an embarrasment to have on my bookshelf."
4,wwf war zone,i didn't like this game at all. it doesnt have good graphicsfor n64. they only have about ten or 12 wrestlers. i tried playing itbut the most i ever could was for about a half an hour....
4,War Zone is 50/50,"The debut of a WWF game for the N64 was fair. Overall, the graphics and sound were pretty good, but I hated the MIDI tracks and not being able to edit moves. Overall, you should rent this first and then decide if you want to buy it."
4,One of the best wrestling games.,"At first, I thoght wrestling games were pretty boring. That was the time when I didn't play WWF War Zone yet. It is a good game with pretty good graphics. You have a variety of scenarios such as fighting in a cage, being able to bash guys on the head with various items, tag team and other stuff to do with wrestling. You have a variety of wrestlers that you can pick such as Brett Hart, Owen Hart, Bam Bam Bigelo, Golddust, and other wrestlers."
3,It was the best in it's day.,"This was the first WWF title I got on the N64 the day it was released. It was the greatest thing since sliced bread to me. The graphics where great, the fun was lasting and the game rocked. I spent hour's just creating wrestlers. However the create a wrestlers always had this greyish skin tonne to them that made them look real fake, and the theme music was in Midi form for some reason? This game was my favourite Wrestling game for a long time, I'm not sure wether I would say the sequel ""Attitude"" is a better game or not, it had better graphics and sound, but it wasn't the same fun factor as War Zone.There is heaps of match options to choose from, hidden wrestlers, hidden modes and lots of fun. But I do recommend WWF NO MERCY over this game now."
5,The Fabric of the Galaxy!,"This book is above and beyond excellent. From the way that the book is packaged, presented and written, not to mention the tangible supplements that are exclusive to this edition - such as the cloth swatch from Darth Vader's cape - what a thrill it is to actually own something that has literally been a part of the Star Wars universe!This book is highly informative, insightful and entertaining.Packed full of sumptuous photographs, illustrations, fold-outs, cloth swatches and an exclusive DVD - ANYTHING a Star Wars fan or those with only a passing interest in film costuming could ever want.This publication is a must. It is simply an absolute joy to behold and a treasure trove for one and all who read it. I'm sure it is destined to become a crown jewel in many a Star Wars fan book collection!I cannot recommend Dressing a Galaxy enough - go buy it, and May The Force Be With You!"
3,Disappointed,"While the above is all true, I was still disappointed with this book. I bought it in hopes of getting lots of detail on the Jedi costumes. While there are fabric swatches, there are only 2 sentences in the entire book with any information on the actual fabrics used. The only details on construction are what can be guessed at from the, admittedly, excellent photos. Most of my major questions went unanswered as the photos don't show enough. For the money, I would have thought there would be more details, given that it is mostly serious costumers who will spend $350 on this book.I sold the book to someone who is more intersted in Padme costumes, of which there are many good photos."
3,No Black Chips,"These chips are a nice heavy weight and feel great. The case seems well made (although each row does have a little extra space - will fit 55 chips per row instead of 50).I was worried there might be manufacturing flaws in many of the chips like bleeding between colors or misalignment of printing. I was pleasantly surprised that about 99% of the chips were 99% perfect.There was one big problem... Instead of 50 blue chips and 50 black chips, there were 100 blue chips and no black chips. I was very disappointed about this, but not enough to return the set."
2,Poker chips,"Disappointing...I bought the chips because they were 14 grams and had a decent write up by other users. However, the chip case is way too big. Each slot can hold another 5 chips. I sent an e-mail to Trademark poker chips and never got a reply. I called the company and they all but played stupid that they sold chips through Amazon.com. They gave me an alternate site to go on to order additional chips but I would have to pay for them along with the shipping. Needless to say, I was less then pleased with a $30.00 additional exspense.As for the chips, I like the weight but after three home games, some of the chips are starting to peal. For for the over $100.00 that it finally cost me, I should of spend a few more bucks and just bought real clay chips.One other thing, the chips are a bit slippery. The clay composite is not too impressive. I recommend that you stay away from chips made by Trademark company."
1,UNACCEPTABLE,"PACKAGE WAS DAMAGED, CASE WAS OLD, DUSTY AND HAD SCRATCHES, CASE HOLDING THE CHIPS WAS BROKEN OPEN AND CHIP WERE EVERYWHERE, CHIPS DIDN'T FILL THE ROWS AS IT SHOULD(MISSING CHIPS) WRONG AMOUNT OF EACH CHIPS, HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DIS-SATISFIED WITH A PRODUCT I HAD PURCHASED BEFORE, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND WILL BE GETTING A REFUND AND NEVER USING AMAZON AGAIN!!!"
4,great show,The concert is very good the only dowside is Yngwie tried to steal the show by turning his volume up.Vai is so amazing it gave me chills when he played lil wing
5,G3 - Live in Denver review,"I bought this because Vai's in it. The only problem I have with this DVD is that Vai only does 3 numbers however, one of them is my favorite live Vai clip to date: I Know You're Here. For anyone who's never seen or heard of Vai, that track on this DVD is what you should see first. Anyone who sees that will be completely blown away with Vai's technical ability and aesthetic impact. I've watched that track 100 times and every time it totally blows my doors off. This guy is beyond this planet's highest standard of musicianship. Satriani is also ridiculously good and I'm going to get more of his live stuff now. If you're a real music buff, you need this DVD."
3,Ditch Yngwie - go for Live in Tokyo instead,"I'm sorry, I understand that legions worship Malmsteen as a god, but he's just off in his own world and not really engaged with Satch & Vai in this performance. He's like a caricature of a guitar god - a parody of himself. Flipping your guitar around is great excitement for the aspiring Guitar Heroes at a bar mitzvah, but it really gets tiresome from a veteran that's doing it constantly. I find the G3 Live in Tokyo DVD with John Petrucci on the third stool instead of Yngwie presents a much better interplay amongst the threesome. All that said, it's still great guitar music, and Yngwie's good for a laugh if you like that sort of thing, so 3 stars is a little harsh. But if you're trying to choose between DVDs and you don't have posters of Malmsteen in your room, go for Live in Tokyo."
5,"Satch, Vai, and Yngwie offer an awesome laidback performance","The two best performances on the DVD are Starry Night and the Voodoo Child jam session. Little Wing is a close third. Steve Vai's incredible skills stunned me from the get-go. Malmsteen keeps his reputation as one of the fastest guitarists in the world. And Joe Satriani cements himself as an incredible songwriter with Starry Night. I got this on Amazon for $9.00. Great deal, I would reccomend it to all guitar lovers and rock/heavy metal/neo classical metal enthusiasts. Great show guys."
1,The picture quality not really likes DVD,"I've got this DVD yesterday, I just can say:""not bad"". of course not good. the cover picture quality really let me down, and then I did put the DVD-rom. the picture quality let me down again. I just can say: This DVD not as good as <Steve vai - Live At the Astoria London>..disappointedly.."
1,Nothing Special,"Same type of set up for Vai and Sat as previous. Same old boring Malmsteen to listen to. Speed pick speed pick speed pick. Malmsteen has always sucked as a guitarist. Why they including him in this, god only knows. This should really be re-named G2."
1,Seriously flawed technically!,"Save your money. Sometimes you can hear Tony Macalpine and sometimes not. Yngwie is almost completely out of the mix in the jam session at the end which is a huge part of the show. There are stunning parts, of course, because all the musicians are awesome but why would they release this dvd with these major sound problems? If you see it for 5 bucks, get it, it's worth about that much."
2,Fine for one watch.,"I am reviewing this and calling it average because one watch was enough for me. The Satch set-up was good, the Vai set-up was average and the Malmsteen set-up was crap. When I first saw Malmsteen play in the early Eighties I thought he was probably the most exciting guitar player since Randy Rhoads. But that was 20 years ago and you can only listen to this kind of music for so long before you fall asleep. Vai's music, though technically superb, is dull and lifeless for me. I always thought his guitar dual in the film 'Crossroads' and his material with Roth was always outstanding, but his playing now, is just boring. Satch is my favaourite from the genre, his album 'Surfing with the Alien' is the best solo guitar album of the Eighties. Overall though Live in Denver is worth watching, but there isn't really much material to replay on this."
4,Excellent,"I'll make this short and sweet. Satriani is the real rocker of the bunch and has the best songs. Vai has the best technique and gives the best performance. Yngwie is the funnest to watch but gets boring quickly. The jam at the end would be better if Yngwie could play with other guitarist. Yngwie showboats and hot dogs so much, I wonder if he knows there are two other guitar players on stage. Personally I think Yngwie ruined Voodoo Child (he did'nt even get the words right at the end). I could play the 3 songs in the jam section better than Yngwie. You will end up hating Yngwie or just laugh at him. All in all this is fantastic music by three dedicated musicians. And don't forget the bands! All stellar musicians as well."
4,Awesome,Satch &Vai; are top notch creative players.Always progressing.I believe Vai is the bestafter Hendrix...so full of ideas&emotion.;A real treat to see Tony Macapline+BillySheehan on his team.The best Band line up.The only problem is nostalgic Yngwie stuck in the80's... hair +music &all.; He looks like Fat bastardfrom Austin Powers shredding now.He hasn't grown asan axman.Playing the same music &sound; as when hewas 19 doing that neo-classical runs back in 82.Vai now beatshim in speed.Yngwie lay off the booze&porter; housesteaks mate.Go back to your Fire & Ice days...trynew & different sounds.Take lessons from Satch...lol!!!Beside all that I luv this DVD.It has inspired me to recordsome new stuff&experiment; like Vai &Satch;.
4,Amazon Review ?,"Hey Amazon, are you there ? I think the usual guy you wheel out for music DVD reviews might not have been suitable for this one. Try thinking along the lines of 'musical ability' rather than 'fashion', it may make more sense to the people that are going to read the very same review page that you employ your man 'in the know' to write for...Good reviews from the guitar players and other musicians that have scored this edition, keep practising those chops, long live Yngwie, Vai & Satch !"
2,not so good,"I have to admit that this wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be. Joe was cool, but it's all the same stuff. And what's up with Steve having only three songs?! His live at Astoria is pretty sickening! Way more recomended! And good grief, hows about laying off the Krispey Kremes Ing-wee!! It was sad to see someone who used to be one of the more exciting players to watch be so weird looking. I mean his playing is cool, if not the most tasteful, but wow! He looked like some kind of 80's version of Leslie West!"
3,"It's just my ""Opinion""","Though I have not watched any shows of G3 coz I live in India, I have just watched one gig of Joe Satriani ... but still own all the DVD's of Satriani & Vai .... including the G3 Live in Tokyo 2005. I feel the first G3 & the latested G3 shows were very meaningful. In G3 Live in Denver ... I really dont think there was any soulful music.Nevertheless I appreciated Malmsteen's capabilites ... but he is stuck in 80's time capsule with all his meaningless stunts.Steve Vai, has evolved in a big way since 90's.Joe still plays wonderful music, as someone said in one of the reviews that this cannot be compared to his Live in SF DVD ... the sound there was amazing.Last but not the least ... extras are total waste.To conclude ... I was not happy with the Live in Denver show, well this is just another fan's opinion.G3 ...Live in Tokyo 2005 rocks !!!"
3,The Viking chief improvises too much!,"I love Yngwie and he is the reason I bought this DVD. I saw the live show at the Greek Theatre in L.A. and thought it was a blast! Joe is amazingly accurate to his studio recordings, Vai is very keen on his ability of the effects and equipment used and Yngwie...finally, he played my favorite track of all time...""Evil Eye"", but the rest of the songs need to be played the way it should be heard instead of improvising left and right. I also bought the double CD of this version and some songs are different than on the DVD. For instance, ""Blue"" is a killer track (on the studio recording of ""Alchemy"") but Yngwie slopped it on the live CD. I can play a more accurate version of this song than it was recorded live on the double CD."
4,G3 - Live In Denver,"This is a good DVD for the price. One problem though is in the 3 G3 Jam songs - Rockin' In the Free World, Little Wing, and Voodoo Child there is something wrong with the audio for Malmsteens guitar, you can barely hear it. You can hear his guitar fine on his solo set."
2,Music...or just chops?,"Been a Satch fan for a long time, and Joe's set is fine. Get the live San Fran DVD for a much better showing by Joe. Vai is his usual self- self absorbed, technically outstanding, and still caught up in how fast he can tap and hammer. As for Malmsteen, his set is a simple excursion into speed picking without any purpose, other than to show you that he can do it. For my money, you are much better off listening to Morse or Johnson. Sects, Dregs, and Rock and Roll is much better, if just for the live stuff Steve did in NY. Just saw Johnson in concert recently and he is musically in a different place in my opinion that the G3 bunch. The G3 DVD simply gets old quickly, as technique overshadows the musical ends. As Santana once said, some folks need to go to notes anonymous to learn to play less."
2,kareoki with guitar,Been a big fan for years but this is getting old. The more stuff that is released the more it reminds me of American Idol with guitar. Heres some generic backgroud music now jam along. Its kareoki!The guitar work has always been brilliant but the imagination behind the rest of the song structures has no innovation. They should just program the rest of the instruments! To me this is turning into showboating.
4,Good Dictionary for YOUNGER Children,"This dictionary is colorful and easy to read. Although the age range states four to eight-year-olds, I think that it is better suited for four to six-year-olds. I bought this for my seven-year-old, but it's more appropriate for his younger brother who will start Kindergarten this Fall. It would also be useful as a supplement for a higher-level dictionary."
5,The American Heritage Picture Dictionary,"This is a bery good bokk for small children. My daughter loves her book and uses it regularly, she is 5 years old and in Kindergarten."
2,only for pre-schoolers,"After receiving this dictionary my 5 year old daughter called me at work said this book is for 'babies', kind of embarrassing as a dad. The item description says age 4-8 years, however the back cover indicated 4-6. I personally verified and this book is definitely NOT for children above 5 years of age. My 5 years old daughter's vocabulary is quite mature than what this dictionary has to offer. The only plus point are the illustrations."
4,Well built but.....,"I came here looking for my second one. Show it a little respect and it will serve you well. However, be sure to check that there is enough lubrication (grease) in it. My first one had very little. This will cause it to fail far sooner than need be.Please note: This is a right angle drive. It fits on drills.....and a lot of other things. ;-) There is nothing wrong with my first one, it's just doing something else."
5,"Good product, Great price....","Good quality product, easy to use, and added safety devices well thought out."
4,Great Sound! No S-Video!!,"Delivers great sound and has enriched our listening experience on music and movie nights! S-Video is missing from the package though, however, this has not appreciably diminished our viewing experience."
3,Most stupid remote,"The product is good, but it comes with most stupid remote. The remote seems to be designed to work with multiple receiver systems (AV1 mode and AV2) and you need to reset them everytime you change the batteries. So keep the manual close to your heart, and don't loose it.The product is OK, but lacks kick!"
1,Little Miss Loser.,"The cd is a compilation of Diana and The Supremes best music. Unfortunately, I bought it ""used"" and it has a flaw on track 9 - ""Reflections."" The disc skips and stutters at the end of the song. I tried cleaning the disc, but the skipping stays. Last time I buy ""used"" from Amazon."
5,Amazing photo essay,"Although certainly not a traditional travel guidebook (the previous reviewer was correct in that regard), this book is a small but beautiful photo journal of Afghanistan.The book contains photos organized by subject (""taxi,"" ""teenager,"" ""hotel room,"" ""customized AK-47,""), taken throughout the country, with very brief notes indicating where photos were taken and their location on a map.Recommended for fans of photography and contemporary graphic design."
3,nice breakdown of a less commonly seen Xing Yi form.,"Never seen anyone do this form in America, but have read about it and was looking forward to seeing it. Nice that they broke it down step by step slowly. Presents 2-person choreographed Xing Yi (Hsing I) set that helps bridge the gap in training between doing solo forms in the air and unrehearsed fighting. The English subtitles are a little hard to understand-- without a solid grasp of Xing Yi basics or speaking Chinese fluently, viewers may miss a lot of the subtleties that make this more than just a 2-person dance."
5,Old Wooden Scrub Brush Replacement,"I was thrilled to find the Harper 182 9"" Scrub Brush. I have looked over and over (including online) for a brush with bristles as sturdy as the old time wooden scrub brushes. I understand the wooden handles are no longer being used because of holding bacteria. I could not be happier."
3,Hollywood Lite,"An average romantic comedy. Made of Honor falls somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars. Certainly not a 5 star movie, not even close, but not a one star movie either. There are some fun moments and a couple of laughs. The leads are enjoyable."
3,GOOD LIKABLE CAST HELP THIS PREDICTABLE ROMANTIC COMEDY! 2 1/2 STARS!,"Seeing Dempsey in this type a role again gives this film a boost. Dempsey, Monaghan and Pollack carry the film on their shoulders and make the most out of this very predictable, featherweight comedy. I've seen worse, but there is nothing here we haven't seen a thousand times. If you like the stars you will like the film. There are worse ways to waste a rainy day."
2,Why?!,"Uhmmm...this wasn't that great. As a matter of fact it was downright mediocre and predictable. Some of the acting was so-so even though I think they could have picked a better love interest/best friend. That chick's performance really didn't do it for me. It tried to be funny but I only managed to chuckle at the scene with the old grandma. On the flip side, at least Kadeem Hardison got a paycheck this time around because Lord knows I haven't seen him in anything that relevant since ""A Different World"". Other than that, I think that the director and the remaining cast and crew, with the exception of Patrick Dempsey and Kadeem Hardison, should all donate their paychecks to aid the cyclone victims in Myanmar. That would have been a better idea than producing such mediocre rubbish."
1,Not worth the time,"I found this film trite and banal, the same thing hashed over and not done well. Unless you are a big McDreamy fan, and I am not, don't waste your time."
2,Can't Stand up to It's Own Second Half,"This movie features fine acting, but it's couched in a ridiculous story. True, it starts off plausibly enough; chance are you'll enjoy the first half. But then it just gets more and more unbelievable, farcical, even, and distinctly distasteful. Plus it's gross in spots when that was entirely uncalled for. Overall, can't recommend this one."
2,missing something,"i watch a lot of romantic comedies. this was cute, but it was missing that magical something. i'm not a big patrick dempsey fan. but i do love Michelle Monaghan."
5,Sexy Patrick Dempsey,Now who in the world wouldn't want to be Patricks wife? The movie was funny bur what I loved best was the beautiful scenery in Ireland. Hey a girl can dream cant she?
3,made of honor,The kiss scene is the best part. It's entertaining. I love the average gal gets the hunky guy spin. Also enjoyed that she wasn't some desperate female pining away for an unavailable bachelor. He had to work to get her.
5,movie,I love this movie. it moves along and has very likeable characters. I think it was a good buy for my collection. it arrived quickly and in good shape.
5,Awesome,I loved this movie and the service was great. It came pretty quickly and was in great condition.Cally
4,Bring over the popcorn & wine we've got girls night top pick!,"Cute formula, romantic flick that is a step above most of the films in this gendre. You won't find any surprises in this text book romantic comedy but the chemistry of the cast make this a fun movie. This was my 1'st time seeing Patrick Dempsey and WOW...... he's engaging.It's a great girl night or date movie. I skipped this movie in theaters because it got bad reviews but I'm sorry I did. The only negative thing I can say about it is that I personally dislike this formula: the grand wedding-interuptis scene & the woman exchanges a dream guy for the guy who in real life would be a relationship disaster of nuclear proportions.Even though I'm not a fan of the formula I am a fan of the movie and will watch it again. Honestly, videos are cheap and this one is worth tucking in next to ""Sleeping n Seattle"", ""When Harry met Sally"", etc."
4,Boy goes after girl and declares his love,"Story about two friends who have grown close to each other over several years until one goes out of the country on business and comes back with a fiance. Funny, cute love story."
3,A cute chick flick,"Yes, this movie is totally predictable: Man and Woman are best friends. Man and Woman are made for each other. Man is too stupid to realize it. Woman gets tired of sitting around and falls in love with a rich and handsome foreigner. Woman becomes engaged to said foreigner. Man then realizes he loves Woman and needs to win her heart.Despite its lack of originality, ""Made of Honor"" is a cute romantic comedy and features the super cute Patrick Dempsey, so this Woman Reviewer recommends it as an enjoyable chick flick."
2,Insulting,"Patrick Dempsey does have star power, but this movie is so cliched and so unappealing, that except for some nice countryside views of Scotland, it is not worth the price of any admission."
3,A Good Mood Movie,"Who doesn't love a romantic comedy? Well for those of you that do, such as myself, this movie is funny, romantic, and very entertaining. Patrick Dempsey plays a really good part as the brides Best Friend, and to watch the things and lengths he goes to for her is hilarious. This movie is one of the best kinds, the ones that make you walk away with a smile!! I hope ypu enjoy it as much as I did!"
3,Fun but we have seen it,Made of Honor is a decent movie I would say 3 1/2 stars if I could put a half in there. It really is the opposite version of the all time classic My Best Friends Wedding. The plot is unoriginal but it is a fun movie to watch. It is a typical chick-flick that some will really like and others may get bored.Just know that you are going to see a very predictable movie from the moment you start watching. If you enjoy seeing Patrick Dempsey as a player then you should enjoy. There are no surprising twists and in the end the question really is... is the perfect man perfect for all women? I guess you will have to watch to find out.
4,Made of Honor Soundtrack,"OK, so maybe the movie is kind of corny and predictable but I give the movie *** just to drool at Patrick Dempsey but Michelle Monaghan is actually the one to watch. Sony did not release an official soundtrack but the music from Made of Honor is easily *****. Here's a YouTube playlist I put together of the music soundtrack for Made of Honor. Enjoy. [...]"
3,Rent don't buy!,Ok - you know the premise of the movie - he loves the bride/bestfriend and wants to stop the wedding. I loved the Scotland parts but the rest of the movie was just average. It is PG-13 for a reason - lots & lots of talk about sex and a few tame bed scenes. Rent don't buy...
5,Just one word - AMAZING!,"I am a huge fan of romantic comedies, which means I've watched a whole lot of them. There aren't too many that made me smile as much! This one was beautiful. Lovely. Very romantic (unlike a lot of the others)...Before watching this I did not particularly like Dempsey (although my friends are crazy for him), but I have to say he was extremely likeable in this movie. Yes the concept has been seen many times before, but I doubt that the feelings of love were this clear and vivid. Patrick and Michelle looked great together :)Make sure to grab a copy if you're looking for something so sweetly romantic it might make you cry..."
3,"Addressed to ""Current Resident""","Item was address to me or ""current resident"". It should not have been addressed this way. If I had not been home to get this someone else would have gotten what I paid for."
3,Cute Movie,"Its a cute movie, kind of the male version of my best friends wedding...not the best movie in the world though but funny."
1,"Ok , seriously.....","this should just be called a crappy version of MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING except wait its really original because its got *GET THIS* a GUY instead of a girl for the Maid of Honor! OMG , hilarity must ensue...RIGHT??? wrong. dont bother. this should be in the 1.00 movie bin at walmart in a couple of months....."
3,Neither here nor there,"I didn't love this movie, but I didn't dislike it. It was ""Okay"" I probably, however, will never watch it again. Patrick Dempsey gets a 8 of out 10 in his role as Tom, so his part in it is pretty decent which is good because he is the lead role. Michelle Monaghan as Hannah, however, was a little bland. I'd give her a 4 of out 10 and actually was thinking if they had gone with a different female in the role it might have been better. I must agree however with other reviewers that the Scotland scenes were rather visually pleasing. The concept of two best friends a male and a female, has been done before. But the idea of the guy being a Maid of Honor is kind of interesting. It was not carried out in the best way though. However, if you have about an hour and a half of free time and it is on television on like HBO or something then, yeah, I'd say it's a ""decent"" way to pass the time."
1,No Legacy Player Support,"Will not play in BDUP-5000. Blu-Ray is plagued with issues, ever changing standards, poor development of discs. If it does not play in a player you bought 6 months ago, then it is just plain garbage."
4,A True Idiot's Guide,"I got this book for a class. Prior to ordering this book, I knew nothing at all about mythology. The book presents everything simply...even with some pretty complex and interwoven stories. The appendix is great."
4,Idiot's Guide to Classical Mythology,"Easy to use reference for anyone studying classic tragedies for the first time. Like other ""Idiot's"" books the layout and index are familiar to the user and so it is easy to use."
5,Good,"One time book as stated in description, I would buy from seller again. The book has good information. If you want to save money the information can be found online but for those who like to read out of a book cant go wrong if you need to learn more about classical mythology."
4,The power of truth,"What a wonderfully written book! This world view is extremely well thought out, and I had to keep reminding myself that it was written before World War II broke out. It reads more like an alternate history written after the war, rather than an extrapolation from before the war. While it would be easy to find the subject matter of this book depressing, in the end I was actually left with positive feelings. This is an optimistic message about the resilience of humanity, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Even after being buried and denied for centuries, the Truth survives and continues to find people willing to sacrifice themselves for It."
3,It had potential,"I was surprised that the plot was actually interesting. Sometimes I felt the acting was mediocre, at worst...but some of that might have just been the fault of an implausible, choppy dialogue script. Character development was very poor, in my opinion. I would have liked to see a bit more depth in a movie taking such a serious stab at cultural issues.I don't regret taking the time to watch it, so that is always a good indication that it had some merit."
2,No magic,"I was expecting a great movie, but the acting was just amateurish at best, often the roles were unbelievable. The story line was OK, although its beginning to be overdone.(a loved one dies, and comes back to help the other get married again) I guess every director thanks he can do better than its been done before. This director failed.... I guess what I was disappointed in the most was there just wasn't any magic..... not between the Mom and her son, nor any of her boyfriends. This isn't a Great movie as I was expecting, but its not bad either. Just so-so."
1,good luck getting through this one,"With all the other good reviews, I was hoping to enjoy this one. But I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. Cheesy and predictable. A bad made-for-tv movie. Kinda wonder where Shanks comes in, but I couldn't sit through it to find out."
3,Telling the truth,The film has a good cast and well done. The story is not portraying the truth of life after death. There is none until the resurrection of the dead at the coming of God for nominal or devout christians.
4,Good wholesome movie,"This movie was a good watch for the family around the holidays... It is however, like most Christmas movies, pretty unreal. Overall we really enjoyed the movie, but would probably not watch it a second time."
1,a heavy theme for a light Christmas movie,"A husband dies in a car accident; he stays around as a spirit until his wife releases his death and then it looks like he becomes a star. The ending left one unsure. The whole movie wrestles with life after death. As a person who believes in life after death because Jesus Christ is my personal Savior, I found the theology in this movie to be awful. If you're going to say someone goes to heaven, you need to go to the One who created heaven and who decides who does go. God says if a person believes in His son, Jesus, as Savior, one goes to heaven, not if a person is good or ""believes"" without specifying what one believes in. God says it is the blood of Jesus that washes away sin. If a person doesn't believe this, God allows that, but heaven can only be claimed on God's terms. If theology doesn't matter to you, you might enjoy this movie. The acting isn't too bad. If theology does matter to you, you probably won't enjoy this movie."
1,Terrible,"I had high hopes for this movie when I saw the description, but it failed miserably. The story had such good potential that it was a real let down when it turned out so bad. The acting was atrocious and the characters totally flat and unbelievable. Don't waste your time on this turkey."
3,Mistletoe,this was a nice familyl friendly romantic movie and I enjoyed relaxing and watching a movie that leaves a good happy feeling after.
4,I enjoyed very much,It was a nice sentimental movie. Glad I bought it. I recommend that folks who like holiday movies watch this.
4,Feel Good Christmas Movie,"Nice, sweet, enjoyable Christmas movie. Nice to watch as a family. Enjoyed Michale Shanks, he had good chemistry with the child actor. I would recommend this movie to see together with your family, puts you in the holiday mood."
2,"Couldnt get passed poor acting/script. I wanted to like this movie, but after ten minutes... Two stars is a gift.",There it is. Grade b in all it's glory. This a shame. I wanted to like it! 2 stars is all I could muster.
3,Another unusual Christmas Story,I am a big fan of Christmas movies that's a fact and this one has a little magic thrown in. Not to mention the fact that Michael Shanks is one of the stars how could I possibly turn down an opportunity to see that smile. The story is whimsical and fun and I was very happy to add it to my collection.
1,Don't Bother !!!,"The other reviews of this movie were very misleading....it is terrible. The acting was dreadful, the ridiculous ghost of her husband, and child, though cute, could not act. Save your money!!"
1,Was a worse movie ever made?,All I can say is thank God I could stop the movie without having to finish it. What a waste. I really can't believe people get paid to make crap like this.
2,Over the top,"This movie is not one I will be keeping. Ghostly appearances of Dad to a young boy who others think is crazy because he says he talks to his deceased father all the time. It gets him in trouble at school, etc. Finally Mom is able to contact her husbands spirit as well. There is a nice ending to all of this as mom has her son seeing a school counselor who also lost his wife. The two of them end up together making the boy happy. To me it was very weird for the deceased father to be around his son all the time. I guess it depends on what you like in a movie."
4,GUITAR LOVERS DELIGHT,"First class effort by one of our best guitar players. This is mostly instrumental stuff with 3 vocal numbers. Although not one of the best singers, Koch's guitar prowess more than makes up for it. The song that really stands out on here is ""Fall From Grace"". This is a southern rock sounding song that's got some beautiful guitar work in it. Great stuff. I also loved the song ""Chief's Blues"", a 7 minute slow blues burner that's got some fantastic guitar work in it. I also liked the album closer ""Cracker Jack Tatoo"", where Koch offers up some tasty slide guitar. Greg Koch's style reminds me more of the late Danny Gatton than anybody I've heard so far. And that's saying a lot since I consider Gatton the best there ever was. This album offers up a big diversity of musical styles, with each song sounding different than the next, but the great guitar work remains a constant throughout. An interesting album that you can't really put a label on. Just a fun guitar lovers album."
1,Wrong cover,"The cover sent to me was not a safari cover like described and pictured here. The 36016 was stickered on over top of the real # for the item. What I got was a solid grayish-beige color. My only option was to turn it in for like and I didn't know what my odds were for getting the correct steering wheel cover, so I did not bother returning it for a replacement safari cover. I figured, who knows how much I would have ended up paying for shipping and what the cover might look like in the end."
2,Unstable!,"This lightweight walker is totally unstable. My 9 month old tries to pull himself up with it, and it topples over on him and bangs him in the head. It isn't heavy enough for children just learning to walk. I imagine that babies with strong walking skills might have fun pushing their toys around with this, but I don't suggest it for kids who can't walk on their own."
1,Dangerous!,"I agree with the previous post. This is BY FAR the most unstable walker I've ever seen; I really regret buying it. When my son first started walking, it would tip over and hit him. Now that he's a very strong walker, I still find that it tips when any weight is put on it. I can't believe that they can sell these!"
1,killer shrews,"I remember this movie as a small child and it scared the hell out of me. Now, I watch it and it is lame as hell."
4,Classic monster movies are the best!!!,"This dvd gets 4 stars because of the production and remake of the old films. The only reason that I did not give it 5 is because it was hard to read the liner notes in the extra stuff because they were too small and in a bright color. You just about have to sit with your nose to the screen to read any of the notes. Who knew Roscoe P. Coltrain had it in him? If your not into classic horror movies, because these movies could be corny to those who don't like the Fake FX, or the one line dialog, Then you need not spend your money on this. But this is a great movie set and for less than seven bucks you will be joining in on the best of James Best and one big ugly gila monster and a fast Hot rod!! Long Live Classic Horror!!"
4,The Killer Shrews,"This is a classic. Anyone from the Phila area who grew up watching Dr.Shock on Saturdays, should remember this one. It was always one of my favorites. The quality of the film is to be expected, but worth having. It also, makes you glad special effects have really progressed."
2,Shrews and Gilas make for interesting watching,"These movies are a hoot! In the first movie, The Giant Gila Monster it is fun to watch the teens hot rodding around in their souped up jalopies trying to escape the Giant Gila Monster. The songs are hilarious and the subplot of the young man trying to raise money for his little sisters braces makes no sense in the plot. The second movie on the DVD is the Killer Shrews. This movie has a better plot and makes a little more sense than the Giant Gila monster. Did anyone notice that the captain of the ship is the same actor who played Jim Lindsey the Guitar Player on The Andy Griffith Show. These movies are fun but dont expect too much."
5,Whattda want for $7.00?,"Actually, I loved the movie ""Gila Monster""! It was super seeing all those old (I mean old) hot rods. The slang the kids use is super neat to hear (Hey, Daddy!) The songs thrown in were a little silly, but they gave me a good chance to get a snack without pausing the DVD. Did I know how the whole thing was going to turn out in the end? YES, of course, but I still had a good time getting there. Honestly, if you are placing an order already, just go on and add this one too. You probably won't regret it!"
3,Ohhhh it's so bad - I love it,"OK, these are two egregiously awful pieces of movie-making. Yes, yes, of course.However, if you enjoy cheesy movies with over-the-top plots, truly bad monster effects, wacky dialogue, and heroines with inexplicable foreign accents, get this two-movies-in-one DVD. The price is right, and you'll have hours of guilty pleasure watching teenagers save a pathetic podunk town, and dogs with bits of carpeting glued on them gamboling about looking not at all like fierce, threatening giant shrews.But, don't be confused. These are BAD movies."
3,Only an extra large pizza would offer more delicious cheese!,"This is a fairly low rent disc, four chapter stops and a hard to read bio page that offers little of real interest. The picture quality is quite poor, one posted review offers the idea that this is a copy of a VHS tape rather than a film negative, during one scene the image breaks up in a cluster of squares (I guess that is what some call refracting?).The movies themselves remain equally low rent 50s swiss cheese fests. Drive-in misfires from an alomst forgotten era. Still monster fans will find more than enough fun in the movies to gobble them up, but they may wish to look elsewhere for better looking transfers of these...gems. The movies are recommended, this particular disc release is not."
2,Disappointing!,"What a disappointment. Seeing Kline, Ronstadt and Smith on the cover, as well as in the description, I believed this was the movie version. I should have read further through the reviews. However, the misleading was not necessary. How many have you sold to unsuspecting innocents like me? Even so, I would have enjoyed this, had it been acceptable quality. The quality is extremely poor, the remastering done very sloppily, the color washed out, and the camera angles leaving one quite distracted from the performance. AND I paid $18.99, although I see it is being advertised for $17.99. Thumbs down!"
2,A+ operetta/perfomances; mediocre staging; TERRIBLE DVD,"The title says it all: but until the ""movie"" version comes out this will have to do"
2,"great performance, awful video","This is an excellent performance, especially from Kevin Kline and George Rose. But the video quality is so awful (something the Broadway Theater Archive is infamous for) that it's only worth watching as just that, an archive, or if you are looking for good ideas for a performance."
3,Pirates of Penzance with Kevin Kline,I had a bit of trouble getting this DVD to play but eventually it played OK.I am a great fan of Kevin Kline but I was a little disappointed with this production.The sound was not really good and some of the singing was not good either.Linda Ronstadt tried hard but I think that she struggled with the high notes.I could not recommend this DVD to anyone.
3,"performances good, sound, so-so","Given that this was a live performance 20+ years ago, and outdoors to boot, I expected some sound issues.. but not the ones I've got. Sadly, over time, it appears that spots in the original sound track have decayed and there are occasional ""hiccups"" in the sound, kinda like the old cassette tapes that had been eaten once too often. Other then that, I think it's a great performance. I recently saw a local production of this at the local high school and they did quite well too (and so the differences between this and the '83 film version are not a surprise to me, as they seem to be to some..)Gotta love Kevin Kline's performance :)"
2,Poor Quality DVD,"This outdoor stage production seems like wonderful fun. It is playfully presented, and well acted and sung (for the most part). I was disappointed in the video since the colors seem to be washed out at times (especially when a white dress dominates the scene--it seems to bleed into the other colors). I was most disappointed in the sound quality. At times, the most prominent sound is a minor accompanying instrument. I strained to hear the faint voice in the background. Maybe my hearing is as bad as the nursery maid's, but you might want to look for another production."
4,See the brilliance of Kevin Kline with a fantastic ensemble cast!,"Wanna have some fun? Watch this great G & S classic ... then watch it again. We don't get the opportunity to see really funny ""over the top"" stuff much anymore ... don't miss this one!"
3,Pirates Broadway,"I'd recommend this only for real fans of the Pirates of Penzance. Unfortunately, it's NOT the movie with Angela Lansbury (though so many stars of the movie ARE in this one). I enjoyed it but then again I'm a real fan of the opera."
4,Great Complement to the VHS Movie Release,"It just doesn't get any better than this cast in this production. We have had the VHS tape of the movie forever, and love it. Even our little kids love it now. So I was happy to see this was available. Like others have commented the sound can be poor and the video quality isn't great. But, to see it on the stage rather than a sound set is really cool. It is fun to see both the differnces and similarities. And, while we LOVE Angela Lansbury, it is a real hoot to see Patricia Routledge in the role. We have been fans of hers since discovering ""Keeping Up Appearences"", and she really gives a such an outsize presence to the role that Angela's seems a little ""small"" in comparison. Routledge was the deciding factor for us in making this purchase, and in spite of the poor production factors we were not disappointed."
2,Pirates in the fog,"The performance shown on this DVD is wonderful as one would expect, given the cast. However, the video quality of the DVD is so poor that it is hardly worth the effort. The audio is better but still substandard. Unless you are into historical performances, it would be better to buy the movie version, especially now that it is going to DVD."
2,Delacorte Theater version - Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance,I was hoping to get the version with Angela Lansbery but it appears this version is not available in DVD. Please let me know when it is available as i would like to purchase it.
1,horrible video and sound quality,"The video and sound quality on this performance of ""Pirates"" are so wretchedly horrible that I found it unwatchable.I'd expect better of a bootleg!Eric Alan Isaacson"
4,waiting for the 1983 production!,"an excellent production, but clearly not of the quality or the fun of the 1983 version (which included angela lansbury) which was originally broadcast on A&E Network.now that a VHS version of the latter is available, hopefully a DVD one will soon be forthcoming."
1,"Save your money, I got ripped off.","I could just kick myself for buying this without reading all the customer reviews first. This has to be the biggest waste of $20 ever. I was fully expecting the movie version, and was met with only a crappy, low-quality tape recording of an on-stage performance. And what peeves me the most is that I cannot return it because it has been OPENED! What am I supposed to do with this? I couldn't watch more than five minutes of it before I turned it off. Please tell me I can still get my money back somehow!"
1,Looks like it was made by an amature film company,This is the worst DVD I have ever seen. I love the VHS version and I have been waiting for the Pirates of Penzance with Kevin Kline to come out on DVD for years. I had a lazer disc of it years ago and loved it. The picture on this DVD is so bad it is unviewable. It is blurry and was obviously done on a home camera. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. The audio is poor also so it cannot even be used as a CD.
4,Absolutely delightful!,"I loved it! It reminded me of the days back in high school when my sister was Ruth in their production. The video is terrible but I loved it. It was charming and funny and everything a Gilbert & Sullivan production should be. The audience response was wonderful to hear. I feel that you can never enjoy G&S more than when it's live. It was thrilling to recognize Patricia Routledge. I fell in love with Frederic and adored Kevin Kline as the Pirate King. It was remarkable how lively and animated the performance was. If you are a true lover of Gilbert & Sullivan, you will love this. If you are a stickler for video and sound quality, you will HATE it."
1,Absolutely Disgraceful,"This is one of the worst quality DVDs I have ever seen in my life, and even at a low secondhand price, I feel cheated that I made the mistake of buying this. Video quality is utterly mediocre (like a fuzzy washed-out home video that's been played to death and wasn't any good to start with), the sound is terrible mono (like a worn-out cassette), the filming is primitive and it just looks and sounds unbearably awful. I like this work, but this DVD should never have been released. I've seen better bootleg performance videos done on a mobile phone. It's an outrageous disgrace that isn't even worth one star."
2,"Delightful operetta, terrible recording","The world needs good DVDs of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. This is not one of them. The sound quality is very poor, rendering the singing much thinner than it probably was in reality. The photography is in general overexposed, and does things like cast strange pink and blue lights all over white garments. Or maybe that was the stage lighting ... but I've seen far better recordings of stage productions.I'd advise waiting for a really good ""Pirates of Penzance"" DVD to come out."
1,Thought I was buying the movie version,"Really thought I was buying the film version, but instead I received this awful amateur production with poor sound and picture quality. I can't slander the delivery company as it arrived as it should in good condition all the way from the USA to England. I have found the one I want so will have to order this one instead, even though it's not via Amazon. As others have said, it's worth checking the comments first!"
4,(1980),"I thoroughly agree on all sentiments of stage production over film studio. Yet, the digital age had already begun by the eighties, and even footage from outer space already decades old. So why the scrappy quality, if not of method, of reproduction? ...rather like that of a 1920s revival of this show, which happens to be as much a part of Broadway history, as English operetta. The wonderful cast would have been worth a much bigger effort at the dvd production studio (in 2001?).4 STARS (five each for Gilbert, Sullivan, Papp, and Cast; None for DVD; Average = four stars)"
2,Warning - this is the Live Broadway version,"I LOVE the Pirates of Penzance, but this DVD is not the film, it's the broadway show. Not nearly as entertaining. The filming quality is quite poor, and it's hard to understand what is happening."
1,Not deserving of even 1 star!,"The quality of this DVD is so poor, it's unwatchable. Looks like a pirated tape. What a disappointment! I had to toss it."
1,The recording was very bad.,"The play itself was good, but the quality of video and sound was very bad all through the DVD.The sound quality near the end of play was too bad with irregular flattering in sound and video or intermittend drop out of sound."
3,The Pirates of Penzance/Delacorte Theater,Picture and sound isn't the best but it is a great addition to any Broadway collection . The preformance is perfect.
3,Awesome in spite of Linda Ronstadt,"This is hilarious!Kevin Kline and Rex Smith are terrific, as are the other less famous actors. Linda Ronstadt was poorly cast and can't act at all; but if you can ignore her part, you will enjoy this version of a classic operetta!"
1,Defective Recording,"This recording is simply DEFECTIVE.It opens with a disclamer about the quality of the recording, and boy, they are not kidding!This is not a simple case of VHS quality on a DVD. Instead the video quality is comporable to the first live broadcast from the 1969 moon landing. And the audio quality is in the same league as early cheap casette recorders, complete with pitch shifts..It is clear that abosoltely no attempt was made to clean up or remaster this recording. Even the title credits suffer from from jitter distortion and there is time base noise at the bottom of each frame.Some example frames at VienneseBall dot org slash PiratesThis is particularly criminal because it was such a superb cast and inspired live performance.I am immediately returning this to Amazon. This recording should never have been released."
4,Johnny Depp Stand Back ... This is a REAL Pirate King,"""Pirates of Penzance"" was the first of Joseph Papp's productions in Central Park, and the quality of the operetta's production shows through. The actors range from tremendous (Kevin Kline as the Pirate King and Patricia Routledge as Ruth) to very competent (whatever happened to Rex Smith).The comedic interaction with the orchestra is as Gilbert & Sullivan would have wanted. What they really would have preferred, however, was better camera and sound quality. The constraint is that this is a play performed outdoors, in the summer, in Central Park. Given those constraints, the camera work was admirable and the sound quality quite acceptable.I attended this production, as well as seeing it performed by (essentially) the same cast on Broadway a year later. I have never understood (other than marquee value) why Routledge was replaced by Angela Lansbury on Broadway; you will see that Routledge was an inspired casting choice here."
1,"Excellent music, poor quality","No doubt that Pirates of Penzance is an excellent musical with a great score and lyrics. But this version of it, performed in front of a live audience in Central Park is of very poor quality. For example the video looks like it came from a bad TV show from the 60's. Second, the audio sounds as if the orchestra is louder than the actors most of the time. In fact most of the time, you can't hear the singing at all. My advice is, get the movie version instead."
1,Not what I expected,"This is not the version of Pirates shown on Great Performances. It is a video of the actual stage performance in Central Park. The video quality, sound, and stage settings do not compare to the Great Performances version, which was superb. Very disappointing."
4,Kevin Kline is awesome,"I continue to watch this Pirates of Penzance, even if the voices are ....well.....ok. It is funny, it is raucous, and I think that at least WS Gilbert would have loved it. I have showed it to British upper crusts who have lived most of their life in Africa, and they love it. Whenever the ""movie"" night occurs, we frequently haul this rendition of Pirates out. The fact that the DVD is of a live performance makes it even better, and that the set is Central Park, even better. The amount of energy that Kevin Kline expends throughout the show is absolutely incredible. The best scenes are with the choruses, not surprisingly because Pirates is a chorus show. Particularly the whole second act ""Foeman Bears His Steel--Go Ye Heroes---With Catlike Tread"" scene cannot be beaten. But, the Paradox song is equally good and fun. The energy in the performance makes up for the voices."
4,Pirates of Penzance,"I pretty much agree with many of the reviewers - video and audio quality are so-so (but quite listenable) and the sense of fun and excitement in the performance is definitely greater than in the movie version. For me, this is the Kevin Kline version to own. However, I am also a fan of the more traditional performance style and so this is not the ONLY performance I would want to enjoy."
3,Not the Movie,This DVD is okay on it's own. Not the best production values and performances but lacks the fire of a live performance or the polish of a movie. I didn't read reviews carefully so I thought this would be the movie. I was sorely disappointed.
1,Do not buy this dvd!,"The only good thing about this product is the fact that Kevin Kline, Rex Smith and Linda Ronstadt are actually in it. I wish I could give this NO STARS!The quality of the transcription to DVD is extremely POOR with washed out color and poor editing.This is a stage production and suffers from poor camera angles and blocking. Oh God, the microphone was placed next to the xylophone and it is played loudly in the Major General's song!The last thing I leave you with is DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Wait for the studio production with Angela Lansbury in the cast to go to DVD and buy that one."
2,Also sucked into buying what I thought was the movie,"I'm usually a pretty careful reader, but was making a quick Christmas order of musicals for my little daughter. I saw the cast list, and remembered that Rex Smith and Linda Ronstadt were the principals, so I bought this DVD. Big disappointment when I found out it was a 2nd rate video of a live performance.I really liked the 1983 film version, and hope its owners release to DVD soon.I'll certainly be more careful before ordering from Amazon again."
3,Stars Shine in Papp's Pirates,"This is a video tape of a live performance in Central Park produced back in the day by Joseph Papp. The quality of the images is mediocre at best because of the technology available back then. However the cast, Kline and Ronstadt in particular,shine through in spite of it. It is much more fun than the 1982 version seen on BBC and also on DVD. The production is muchmore accessible to American audiences. I highly recommend it, in spite of the poor quality.P.S. Fans of Patricia Routledge of Hattie Wainthrop fame will get a kick out of her turn as Ruth."
3,Fun production marred by poor camera work,"This is a taped version of the play performed in Central Park. I've watched many filmed plays and I was expecting the limitations and problems that come with any play taped under these circumstances - low quality sound, limited camera angles.What I didn't expect was that the principals would be shot from the back much of the time. I think I saw Rex Smith's back side more than his face! In several of the production numbers, the only close-up camera is one at the rear and side of the stage, so you can't see faces at all. I've seen other Broadway Archive tapes and they don't have these problems. It's disappointing because despite the camera limitations, the performance has a lot of energy and fun that even the movie version lacks. If they'd only used the camera at the front of the stage more often!"
1,Very poor quality of original source material,"I had the pleasure of seeing this production on Broadway, and was looking forward to receiving this DVD. It opens with an ominous warning that the 'digital re-mastering may reveal limitations of the source material'. Boy, they weren't joking. It looks like they got an old copy of the video tape, pulled it out of the cassette, dropped it into a bucket of Drano, and then transferred the result to DVD. For my money, not even the performances (seen murkily) can overcome this major short-coming. A great disappointment."
3,misleading,"I had recently seen the 1983 version of Pirates of Penzance with Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstadt, and Angela Lansbury on TV so I wanted to buy it. However I did not realize that this particular version is not out on DVD (and rare on VHS). I mistook this item as the movie not realizing it was a recording of a stage production. I did not realize my mistake until I had already opened the packaging so I could not get a refund for the movie. The quality of the stage production was not that impressive either - the music and dialogue were scratchy and distant. I'm holding out for the 1983 version to come out on DVD."
2,"wonderful players, WORST possiable recording","I bought a copy of this thinking it was the one with Angela Lansbury in it, all the rest of her fellow players are here but not her. Turns out that this is a live recording of Kline & the rest done in a theater with the absolute worst sound recording i have ever heard. The video is poor as well. perhaps it was done with single camcorder all-in-one. It really is all that bad a recording. The professional version including Angela Lansbury is still available on VHS but not DVD (it is wonderful). Do not waste your money on this offering by Kulter."
1,Poor presentation,"This DVD should not appear in any professional listing. The sound and video are of a quality that one would expect from a cheap analog camcorder. Despite the big names in the cast, the performance is worthy of a conventional high-school drama team. This DVD is definitely not recommended."
5,"Good product, better Customer Service!","We had no problems with the hose becoming tangled. The pressure was OK for our needs. However, when we detected a few leaks from pin-size holes, we were concerned. We shouldn't have been. The Customer Service people at Plastair were quick to respond to my email and not only sent us a replacement hose but threw in a new nozzle for the inconvenience! Good job Sarah and Tom."
4,75 ft coiled Hose,I love this idea. It reaches really far. Only problem is it gets tangled but I still prefer it to rolling a hose in.
4,simply amazin',"incredible graphics great sound easy to learn/ hard to mastergameplay many options excellent replays design your own player andteam in other words, BUY THIS GAME!"
4,Almost Perfect,"This game has unbelievable graphics combined with great lasting appeal. one minor detail you can't pass easily, heres a tip forget passing pick a passing shotgun play and run with the quaterback up the right sideline and use stiff arm to get atleast a first down almost garunteed, in one game only I got over 300 yards with steve young. other than this interesting abilaty the game is perfect"
2,Why acclaim should fix it's little so called football...,"First of all, acclaim spends so much money working with Iguana to create a GOOD fottball game. The only thing good about the football games are that they contain cool pictures, and good (not always) chosen ratings. Why the hell would anyone play NFL 1999, if there is a game called Blitz out? My suggestion is that you should all get Dreamcast, and buy NFL 2000. If you wanna play REAL football, Kick the iguana, and blast the acclaim, and get into some Electronic Art Material."
4,Could be Better,"This product is a good value for the product recieved, however, i would advise you to save your money and buy Haynes Flannel pajamas. They are only three dollars more ($13 a pair at walmart) and are alot nicer in my opinion. You will spend more but be happier with your purchase."
5,Great for sleep...great for lounging about...,These are great to wear for sleep or lounging about. What's so good is that I can talk to my neighbors in the confines of te hallway and they would swear that I'm wearing a jogging outfit and not pjs!!
4,The Echo Manual,"I bought this book for the Cardiologists in my department. I am a division assistant for a medical center. I have no clinical background. I got this book to replace an outdated copy.. Same title/author, so the cardiologists prefer this manual."
2,Okish,"Average to say the least.Written by ""the "" mayo clinic cardiologists who need to get with the programme and realize that the world has moved on."
1,Old edition,Don't be misled by the low price- this is the 2nd edition- and the 3rd edition has been out for some time. Get the newer edition.
2,Nothing special,"Well, if you've bought other books about Marilyn as I do, this one won't add much to your collection. I prefer to choose a book with relatively unseen pictures of Marilyn since we've all seen so much of her, and this book certainly fails in this regard. I also don't like the presentation of this book, the quality of the paper is bad, and there are too many words surrounding the pictures, making the pages look rather crowded..."
5,An excellent Bowie comp!,"A great comp for Bowie fans and new fans! Some Highlights are Space Oddity and Ziggy Stardust! A must have! Just listen to the samples!Also, check out The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars!"
1,"Shallow, too many cliches","This film trots out just about every cliché you can think of about crime in Latin America. It also has some ridiculous coincidences, and utterly improbable plot twists. That the boyfriend turns out to be gay is hardly credible. This a want to be art-action film. Much of the ""suspense"" in this movie turns on sick sadistic scenes. It really isn't a clever movie."
2,Not what I expected...what a shame!!!!,"I lived in Venezuela for more than 20 years, I was never robbed or kidnapped, I do know that secuestro express happens a lot, but I think this movie does not represent the reality of Caracas, I believe that it was made with the intention of selling violence instead of showing the actual facts, it's ashame that people around the world are going to see this movie and think that this is what Caracas is about, there is a lot more to it"
4,These folks know their stuff!,Wanted to replace a remote lost in a fire. Remote arrived promptly. Needed technical assistance to program it. Turned out my 20 year old car's computer wouldn't accept a new remote. Discount Keyless promptly offered to accept a return.
4,Pickled Bologna,"I like pickled items, but I am the only one in my family who does. This large jar will last me a very long time. Not as good as the pickled sausages, but that is a personal preference. I love those sausages. These are pretty good as well."
4,Nice curtain great company,"I ordered this for my window in the kitchen door. It is nice but came with a stain that I could not remove. I emailed them and they refunded my money with shipping for the problem. I didn't need another one as I had already picked one up somewhere else. Although the product didn't turn out usable, the company stood behind their product which makes them great in my eyes."
2,Random colors?,In the picture the item is dark colored and it doesn't say otherwise in the description. I received some ugly bluish color. I suggest you take this into consideration before purchasing one even if its only a couple bucks.
5,great for transition,"As I have become disgusted with secular lyrics, but still am young and enjoy ""a good beat,"" this has been a wonderful transition for me. The Lord is exalted and Jesus is called by name while I am not turned off by bad attempts at urban music. Yolanda has successfully mixed glorifying God with urban music."
4,pleased,I was overall pleased with this cd and it was received in a relatively short amount of time.
5,Powerful. Inspirational. Appealling to all generations.,It isn't just the words that make each song touch your heart and sprit. It is her annotated delivery. God is using her to reach people from all walks of life. God Bless you Youlanda.
4,YOLANDA IS A POWERFUL WOMAN OF GOD!!!!,"At first I was a little concerned when she left Verity to Elektra. I thought she was going to start singing secular music but this CD is Spirit-filled. ""That Name"" is AWESOME!!! Her zeal and love for Christ shines through on this song. It moves you to worship God which I love to do. ""In the midst of it all"" and ""Open My Heart"" are also powerful. This CD has a variety, from contemporary gospel to upbeat and inspirational. Well Done Yolanda, and God Bless You!!!"
3,Not too pleasing,"After Songs from The Heart, I expected more. And this one simply didn't deliver for me. But one of her best songs she has ever recorded, In The Midst of All, can be found on this one. Other than that and maybe and Open My Heart, it's an average album."
1,Stay away!!!!!,"EVERY song on this CD is not the original version, but an inferior studio take that was passed up for good reasons. There is nothing written on the CD or box to indicate that these are alternate takes, or the standard double-talk disclaimer ""These are new stereo recordings by one or more members of the original group."" United Audio Entertainment's website states that they are in business to exploit music, and exploit it they do. There oughtta be a law against this!"
4,the best Western Armenian Textbook,"This new textbook is great. After buying other books I am happy that there is finally a serious book on the market. Don't save money with cheaper books. If you buy this one, you can forget about all the others. The teaching method is refreshing. Right from the beginning you start with useful words and expressions. You always have the feeling that you don't lose your time. The explanations are clear and ""friendly"". I rate this wonderful book with 4 stars only, because the fonts used for the Armenian letters are a headache for the beginner. They are too calligraphic, they should be more simple (and different from each other!). I wished that this be changed in the next edition - the 5 star edition! Another wish is, that this book be accompanied by audio-cassettes. In that case you really don't need anything else."
3,A Fishing Adventure,A fishing adventure that is full of fun and exitment. Mikey is a fisherman on his stepfather's fishingboat. Mikey thinks he is in love. Can he find love?
4,The Big Catch,"Mikey is a boy that has very strong beliefs and has to work already at the age of thirteen. He has a dad, and he works on the charter boat too. They set out on a big charter weekend and catch a monster fish that will go down in the record books. But there is a problem. This fish can't go down in the record books if one of the skippers hooks it, and Mikey hooked it. But Cal somehow bribed Bill to say that he caught it. As the fish went down in the records Mikey became mad.As a thirteen year old I liked this book. It is exciting and always kept me on the edge of my seat. If you like these kinds of books this is the one for you!! This book is written as a love, action, sad story and it is a book for everyone."
3,Lord of the deep Review,"Lord of the DeepBy: TylerLord of the Deep is about a kid named Mikey with his family and friends on a vacation.On a boat called the Crystal-C. They run into a lot of problems like storms, and fighting fish. Mikey gets a hook stuck in his arm and had to bandage it up. So they have the Mahimahi and it is a new world record fish but it is not offical because only one person can handle the fish since Cal striked for Ernie they can't call it in or they would be disqaulified. They went to the peir and saw two flags fluttered with orange and white for ono and yellow and blue for mahi- mahi.This is a great book for anyone who likes the ocean and ships. I really enjoyed this book because I like the ocean."
1,"Choppy, stop and go, no flow at all","I cannot believe that this video has as many positive ratings as it does. This is the choppiest yoga video I have ever had the misfortune of watching. If you are at all accustomed to a normal, flowing routine, this video will drive you as crazy as it does me. Each pose is just an individual video segment. Fade in... pose... fade out.... Fade in... next pose...fade out. It's absolutely horrible. Sadly, I can't return a DVD after opening it so I'm stuck with it... or rather, my local garbage dump is."
4,Excellent for Poses,"This DVD has a good introduction to body awareness and then goes into routines for beginner, intermediate, and advanced practitioners. I find JJ Gormley's cueing excellent, although I prefer reverse cueing so the student can mirror the instructor. But her guidance through posture, alignment, and relaxation is outstanding.Each routine is broken into segments, which is great for learning poses, but lacking in flow, or vinyasa yoga. Some poses end seated while the next begins standing, a bit disruptive to the meditation. And some of the intermediate and advanced routines do not have enough warm-up, especially if you're doing them right after waking up.The relaxation and meditations at the end of each routine are terrific. All in all, a great introduction to yoga poses."
3,Just what I needed,"I have been taking classes for years but live now where there are no classes. I needed something to provide structure and variety to my practice, and this does that. there are several options to try each day of varying length, and I can pause a 45 minute routine and complete it the next day."
3,Stilted Poses,"It's true that this video has more options for routines than any other I've known; however, I find the flow of the routines to be terrible. There is no flow between poses, as she recorded each pose individually and then pieces them together to form a routine that focuses on specific areas."
1,Not worth the money,I bought this video since I wanted an option for at home with having a baby soon. I am an avid power flow yoga student and this video was geared towards beginners only. The advanced options were not too challenging either. I wish I would have researched more before wasting my money on this video.
3,My wife...,"...seems to enjoy these routines ever so often. I would prefer something even more basic, but this will suffice in the meantime."
1,Awful transitions,"Would not even recommend this video to a beginner. The transitions are awful from pose to pose. Example: Going back to table after a series that ends in Warrior 1. Good way for a beginner to injure themselves. They filmed each series of two or three poses individually, so then after a short series there is a black screen and the woman is miraculously back to table pose. Not good. Start with Shiva, don't waste your money here."
4,Technology Is Amazing,"It gets me how far we've come with at home fitness videos, and this DVD is certaintly on the forefront. I've been practicing yoga for little over a year, but depending entirely on getting to studio, which is almost 45 minutes from home. This DVD was the perfect solution and the instruction is nice, offering variations for poses that may be too difficult for some and series of poses that help relieve stress especially after a hard days work."
2,"Boring and slow, more suited for beginners","This video moves very slowly with long pauses between the poses in which they announce the name of the next pose. The instructor's voice is also very monotonous which makes you want to fall asleep instead of working hard. The intermediate and advanced routines that I tried were, first of all, very similar in the level of difficulty, secondly, the level of difficulty itself was more suited for beginners."
2,yoga dvd review,"I did not find this to be a DVD I would use again. The routines were interesting, but kept repeating, and required a high degree of flexibility and balance."
2,Yoga video,"I was disappointed with this product. though they show you a variety of poses, the poses do not flow together and therefore can not be used as a routine. I was not looking for instructions on poses, but more of a class structure that I could do at home. I was unsatisfied with my purchase"
2,Nothing special,"Did not like this video at all. The setting and presentation were dull, and the narration was excessive and monotonous. The routines had no flow or energy. And even though there are ""35 routines"" to choose from, many of the same poses are used over and over again, so you are not actually getting much variety."
3,NOT for beginners!,"I like this DVD and use it all the time, but I already know the yoga positions. J.J. Gormley's verbal descriptions of the yoga positions and movements are ridiculously bad! I honestly start laughing sometimes in the midst of doing yoga because she's so bad at describing it. So if you're a beginner, do yourself a favor and get a Lilias DVD instead."
2,Too bored,Instructions makes you sleepy but neither is takes you to meditation. Too many options and all of them are pretty similar.
4,Good variety of yoga abilities,This DVD offers a wide range of poses and routines for all ability levels with the ability to select the area of the body you wish to focus on or the type of routine you would like to do.
4,Great!,"The ability to choose the workout you need based on not only your level of practice, but which area you want to focus on (flow, centering, spine, hip mobility) for a give day is the biggest plus of this video."
4,Excellent.,"I have attended class with a very thorough teacher so I found this very easy to follow, having had that experience. Nothing substitutes a good teacher, but this comes close. Pleasant background music."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Exactly what I was looking for, demonstrations are great, as a beginner I want to see each exercise demonstrated to prevent unnecessary injuries. I feel safe mimicing the poses. Great stretches, I am already feeling a difference in my body."
4,Great Video,"I think this is an excellent video for people of all abilities and flexibilities! The instructor constantly reminds for that you should not go further than your body is able. This is helpful, because your less likely to hurt yourself doing the poses.I did feel a little sore after doing my first workout, but thats because I am the most un-flexible person every. Despite being a little sore, I felt energized after each workout. A half-hour a day really helps a lot!I would recomend this video to anyone who wants to try out yoga, or any one of any skill level, because you can keep challenging yourself to do the harder poses and workouts."
2,Not for every body,"Yoga for every body doesn't begin to offer yoga for various bodies. I have no idea why it is given that name. There is no real introduction, no suggestions on how to use the DVD, and the routines I checked out included no suggestions for modifications for difficulties with any of the positions. I am mystified. Maybe the routines are easier than the usual? Even if so, that does not make them useful for a great many of us.Perhaps for beginners without any restrictions or body difficulties."
2,"choppy video, not really class form","I am a beginner to yoga and was looking for something to take me to the next level. Although, there are many options on this video, it is all pieced together and not in a class format. Did not like this at all! Instructors voice was also annoying."
1,Too scared to watch....,"I was excited to watch and follow the yoga routines in this DVD after seeing so many positive reviews on Amazon. The cover of the DVD looks promising too. I'm not sure if it's just me but the lady in the video scared the crap out of me. Something about her voice and body were just not right.... She's also in this room with all these eerie decorations instead of a relaxing waterfall, green grass, or Feng shui type of room like normal yoga videos. Not sure how to describe it but it's like walking into your great grandmother's house that hasn't been redecorated in a while because she died years ago. I thought I was being paranoid so I showed it to my friend to get a second opinion. I threw this video in the trash that same day."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,I gave this video a 1 because I could not give a 0. This was a big waste of money. I wish I could return it and just get my money back. First of all the want more than just laying on the floor breathing or rolling my neck. I did not want meditation I want workout. Maybe I missed something here but this was just not for me.
4,Diverse yoga routines,"Good DVD with lots of options. Pretty well organized, many useful routines, relaxed pace, easy to follow. Very good value for the money. Many of the routines are fairly short, so it is a good thing that there are many options. I would recommend this DVD for anyone looking for some variety in an easy yoga routine."
4,Very good for Yoga beginners,"I'm Yoga beginner. I find this DVD very good, since offering option to choose your training type. I loved the exercice with title (do not remember exact title) 'adapted to do during menstrual period' . I didn't like the fact that one person does yoga and another voice comment. But it is difficult to exercice yoga when talking I suppose."
4,Lots of options,"I bought a bunch of yoga DVD's at the same time, so I haven't gotten to use this one extensively, but it seems really good. I was confused when I was reading the reviews before, because some people said it was too easy, and some said it was too hard. I have taken two 3 month yoga classes before (the last one being two years ago), so I started with the beginning routines. I would say about 3/4 of the routine is super easy (for about 3 minutes you just stretching your eyes by rotating them in circles), then it jumps way ahead into poses that require a lot of balance. It was really strange. Other than this, I really like it. I like to do the meditation routine before bed. I also love the fact that there are so many options."
5,Excellent,"This is a fantastic yoga DVD. I was a little concerned after reading the reviews, regarding the way the video jumped between poses, but it's not a problem at all. There's plenty of time to adjust your pose before the sequence gets going, and it's not unlike what would happen in an actual class anyways. The variety of routines is excellent. The voice-over explaining what to do is good, allows you to follow along even if your pose keeps you from seeing the tv screen. I'm not sure this would be a good video if you are jumping into yoga without ever having taken a class, but if you have taken a few classes, this video is fantastic. Highly recommend it, and will consider buying other videos in this series."
3,Not a flow yoga,"I bought this because of all the raved reviewed. I am quite disappointed because I don't get used to doing yoga one pose at a time. This DVD is just that, do one pose, stop and the go to the next pose. I did this video this morning, It does not have any 60 minute routine. I swear I picked the 45+ minute routine, but it seems like I got 3 or 4 poses then go to savasana. I looked at the clock and it was barely 20 minutes. I picked another 45+ minutes routine, same thing, just a few poses and then another savasana. After did 2 routines, I gave up. I felt like I had not accomplished anything and felt so Un-satisfying; I've been so sad all day. I like to do a full routine Vinyasa style and this video probably won't do it for me. However, I think the instructor is really really good with form and instructions, each pose was very careful and slowly executed. Oh well, I have to do a make up session this evening."
5,Perfect Yoga Video,I love this video! I've used it almost every day for the past three weeks that I've had it. It is perfect for beginners (like myself)as there are plenty of beginners routines between 20-50 minutes that are fun and challenging. I still haven't gotten to all the beginners routines but have done one or two of the intermediate ones which are a little more challenging but not impossible. Would reccomend this to anyone wanting to take up Yoga.
5,the best yoga for people over 50,I already have this dvd and use it so frequently that i feel i must have a back up in case it it will be too damaged to serve me and my husband. It issimple andlovingly presented yoga for every body and every soul/
5,Great Deal,"Who wouldn't want 35 routines on one disk, that's like having your own personal trainer :)The beginner routines are great for anyone just starting out and not looking for something too strenuous. This disk also introduces some stretches that I had never seen on other yoga dvds (omg there's yoga for your toes?!). It is also very nice being able to pick the length of the work-out for those mornings when you don't have a lot of time."
3,Not exactly what I expected,"This was my second yoga DVD purchase, and I was enticed to buy it after I read all the positive reviews. Compared to ""Yoga For Beginners"" with Barbara Benagh, this DVD is not as good. I do like that there are a variety of subtitles to choose from and that they are categorized into different levels of expertise (beginner - advanced). I think that it could have been better in transitioning between poses. Sometimes you are in a pose and then the next thing you know it has faded out and you're in a new pose. It also could have been better in terms of expressing breathing patterns, which is very important in yoga. It does mention breathing at certain moments, but it is does not really relate breathing to the poses, the way I needed it to as a beginner."
5,Great video,"I like the format for this video, it has 5 or 6 routines for Beginner, Inter, and Advanced level which is nice to rotate through. I have done most of the Inter and Advanced routines and like them.This has been my daily video for the last couple of months.I wouldn't call it a ""power yoga"" because it doesn't have downdogs between every position, a nice change."
3,Not what I expected,This book was in okay shape and took a while to get here. While it is probably a good book it is not what I expected.
3,Good introduction,"Ultimately, if you have one of the moms described in this book you'll want a good counselor to help you not repeat the same mistakes with your children. This book can be a good introduction if you're wondering about how you parent or were parented and whether you need counseling. However, if you've already been through good counseling I'm not sure this book adds anything to it. It covers different types of mothers so the whole book won't be applicable. I do highly recommend these authors."
2,not so sure,"At first I was excited about this book. Now, I am not so sure. I think they are ignoring the cultural bias we have in america towards independence from family. Their work does not seem to be based on clinical research, but just experience in therapy. Many of the outcomes are the same.... anxiety, depression. There are many reasons for one to experience such difficulties, not just mom. The book contributes to the mom bashing we already hear about in therapy. It does call for some responsibility on the reader's part to change, but not enough. Aren't we supposed to honor our parents? They do not operate in a vacuum. We helped create our own existence. Wondering how biblical this book is really.... It really is just a pop psychology book with little substance to back it. It may be helpful for some self awareness, but like I said.... not so sure."
5,What a great book.,"If you had a less than perfect Mom, this book is a keeper. I found it very helpful in sorting through my childhood and moving forward with my future."
4,PPS is one of the books that I always recommend,"I have been a trader for 23 years and there are three books I always tell people to read before I will talk to them. PPS, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and a new one, Trend Following by Covel. They don't have the Golden Mean but they will introduce you to the ideas that will make you a better trader. Read and test before you put your money on the table. Otherwise just go to Vegas, you'll have more fun there losing your money.PS in all the years I have been trading only two people have read the books, one is my son!! That should tell you how serious people are about making money.Fourfman"
5,Inspiring Survivor,"A must read! Simply put, Jennifer Lauck is a truly inspiring survivor! As I read ""Still Waters"", my admiration and respect for her as a human being, as a woman, as a writer and as a survivor grew to bursting. Her question as a young woman to her adoptive mother was such a poignant, powerful and hopefully empowering question: ""What would my mother think of your treatment of me?"" My heart sang ""YES"" to the courage and strength that it must have taken to believe enough in the truth of her experience to even formulate such a question. With such a wise internal compass, there is no need to wonder what is to become of her -- she will triumph. She is a true heroine."
3,Still Waters,"I had read Blackbird, and was pretty excited to see that Jennifer Lauck had written a folow-up book....The first part of the book was very good and very moving, but as it went on I felt she was wallowing in self pity. I feel that as she raises her son she may realize from a mother's point of view that she may have been a little too harsh.....I do believe she had a horrible childhood and had many problems with relationships because of it; but give herself a few more years as a mother.."
5,High School Musical 3 comes full circle!,"Anyone who loves the first two high school musical movies will love the third installment. It comes full circle with a lot of storylines and scenes from both movies...but on a grander scale. The cinematography is just awesome and you really can tell how much more money producers have put in the movie. Big kids and little kids will enjoy watching it. Plus, the extras and the digital version that comes with this disc is an even sweeter deal!"
4,We love HSM! All of them!,"Just an FYI to above poster that stated ""Among the main four, the only other cast member worthy of notice is Corbin Bleu whom has plenty of charisma even though I'm not yet convinced he's got any serious acting ability. But then - I've never seen him do anything outside of HSM. ""Corbin has done several other shows and I think he does a pretty good job acting. He did Jump In on TV and Flight 29 Down. I think that that HSM 2 was better but this was a nice ending to the other 2 movies and my preteen son loves them all!"
1,Unsatisfied,"The item I ordered, that was SUPPOSED to be here by 12/22, still hasn't arrived, and it's 1/9! I have emailed SEVERAL times, but have yet to get a response! Needless to say, I DO NOT reccomend this seller!"

1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!,"THIS SELLER HAS NO INTENTION ON SENDING YOUR ITEMS, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ITEMS SINCE FEBRUARY AND AFTER SEVERAL EMAILS, I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE! BEWARE...DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!"
4,Not gonna lie..,"I have loved disney films since I was about four years old and I still do. They're cheesy, but they're always entertaining. I think Highschool Musical 3 is a really well made film with great music, some good acting, and it's just a good time for the whole family. Some of the actors in the film aren't that great, they're way too cheesy for me to find them believable, but Ashley Tisdale is actually pretty decent at being the snobby diva and Zach Efron is actually a good stage performer. Other than that, most of the cast is slightly forgettable. Good movie and good musical. I have a weak spot for musicals and disney, so this one gets the better side of me. ps it looks great on blu ray, I'm glad this is how I saw it for the first time, however, i think ima skip out on 1 and 2...I've never seen them but...they must be alot cheesier than the 3rd one. Ok maybe I will rent. :)"
1,don't waste your money,I wish I had waited and borrowed this from the library. No story. No good tunes. No further character development. Most of the talent is wasted. A big step down from the first two movies.
4,"Double ""F"" movie","This is a Double ""F"" movie, because it's heavy on the flirting and fakeness. (maybe not a real word, but oh well) Anyway, this movie has kissing WAY TOO MUCH flirting and some FAKE. We just want a clean kid's movie? Not a movie with flirting, immodest dancing and outfits, kissing. Uh, Hel-lo Disney? I know I gave this 4 stars but if you include all the bad stuff, it deserves 3 stars.(I know, not a big difference.........)"
3,TOO MUCH SINGING!!!!!!!!,"It was great to see the gang together again. But there was TOO MUCH SINING for me, they should have saved that for the music CD."
2,"Trashy, but the songs are... songful.","I got this for my two year old because of the songs. It did exactly what I needed it to. He LOVES the singing/dancing scenes which I knew he would.I wont let him watch it once he gets a bit older and begins to understand the bigger story. It is full of teens prioritizing boyfriends/girlfriends over college and ends with a strong ""my high-school girlfriend is all that I live for"" vibe. The songs are beyond annoying and repetitive. The choreography is interesting enough I suppose. Overall it is what you would expect from a disney channel franchise that pushed one more silly movie out to rake in some merch money."
4,Major Musical,Excellent DVD. Music was fantastic. It was good to see the current class come to end. It was a goo set of movies. Upbeat & fun while still telling a story.
5,HSM 3 DVD,My kids loved watching the movie in the theater. So I bought the DVD for home and they love watching it.
4,Yup 3rd in the series,My kid enjoyed the first 2 and this did not disappoint. Great brainless Disney feel good fluff. Yup if you were able to stomach the first 2 then you will be able to sit thru this one.
4,This Should've Been the Sequel,"just like my title says, i really feel like this should've been High School Musical 2. Think about it, High School Musical 2 wasn't even a high school movie. it was a summer movie! duh! at least this one was worth watching more than the second film. this one was actually pretty decent.High School Musical = 5 starsHigh School Musical 2 = 3 starsHigh School Musical 3 = 4 starsi really hope they're done with this franchise because i keep hearing about a possible 4th film or a TV show based on the films. i think they need to be done with it altogether."
3,Fun movie,"This is another High School Music, but probably my least favorite of the three. My daughters enjoyed it though."
5,A GREAT Finale!,"Although the first HSM movie will always be the best because it was the first and started this whole phenomenon, HSM3 will by far be my favorite. It started out as a low budget tv-movie all the way up to box office hit! It had a modest budget of $11 million and made at least 8 or 9 times that amount.It's fun to watch these movies because that is what it's meant for. It's not meant to be really deep or profound--just fun! You have to expect that from a G-rated Disney film. That's what makes it great!HSM3 has the best set designs, dance numbers, and coming of age drama that anyone can understand. I high recommend this!"
5,High School Musical 3 DVD,I am a big fan of the High School Musical series I can't wait for number 4 with the freshmen cast. I own all 3 soundtracks. I am not a fan of widescreen movies. I think the regular and the 2 disc exended edition should be Full Screen and widescreen. Also the blu ray edition in widescreen only.
5,best prices,My granddaughter wanted this video which was priced retail at 3X the cost on Amazon.com. I love Amazon.com!
5,"So, so great!","This movie is so much better than the first two-- the story is great, the singing and dancing are better than ever-- and the overall quality of the film is easy to see. Love the extras!"
3,High School Musical 3,"This movie was really cute. Zac Efron did a great job. Vanessa Hudgens, gorgeous and the supporting actors helped round out this final sequel. If you enjoy musicals you'll enjoy this."
5,"DVD -- ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year""","I received the ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" DVD very quickly, and it arrived well packaged and in perfect condition as promised. I was very impressed with the professionalism of this seller and won't hesitate to purchase from them again. I buy a lot of movies, mostly DVDs but VHS as well, on Amazon.com and their Marketplace sellers; I would put this seller right on top with the best of them for their terrific service and integrity. Thanks for the pleasant transaction!"
3,Birthday gift.,My granddaughter is a huge fan of High School Musical so needless to say she was very happy with this gift.
1,Horrid Writing with a even more horrid plot,"I hate it so much when other writers screw up characters that have been created by other authors. In this case Troy Denning totaly destroies the characters of Kelemvor and Midnight created by James Lowder and Scott Ciencin respectively. Troy Denning decides to turn Kelemvor into something that he would not have had Lowder written this book and had Midnight just cry about it.Also, the way in which it was written was bad. Not that Denning is a bad writter, but writing from the first person is very difficult and he did not accomplish what he set out to in this book.I think Denning destroyed the entire Faerunian Pantheon single handedly with this book. If you want a good ending to the Avatar Trilogy just stop reading at Price of Lies by James Lowder. It gives you a much more refreshing feeling when you are done rather than a putrid feeling."
5,Great story and an even better format.,"The format of this book alone made it worth reading. I found it quite refreshing to read an epic tale from the first person view of the bad guy, particulary a bad guy who happens to be a minion of the God of Madness, Lies, and other assorted nastiness. It allows the reader to get inside the warped mind of a hopelessly irrational man and explore how he sees the world. Another thing I like about this novel is how Denning depicts godhood, which isn't easy to do. How do you write a character who is omniscient and staggeringly powerful. Denning gives his god characters all of this while also giving them human desires and human failings so that they seem real to the reader. A fast-paced and excellent read."
2,It's good but...,"...it's, like another reveiwer said, written from Malik's pen. Not that it's bad, but to read a story viewed by a follower of a mad god doesn't agree with me. Yes, Malik is amusing, and his view of the gods is funny. But hey, it's not quite ""official"". i.e. Mystra told Ao she wanted to destroy Cyric because she's jealous of his power??? I've nothing against this style, but the story is too twisted. Actually, it's jsut as twisted the way Cyrinishad is."
5,Denning manages to breathe life into Forgotten Realms,"I though Prince of Lies by James Lowder was the best book ever written for Forgotten Realms. Well, I was wrong.Troy Denning has managed to take all the cliches of fantasy fiction and shake 'em up good. The main character, as people have pointed out, is evil and the book is almost a justification for evil gods and characters. However, it actually just shows why evil isn't all black and white.Few books make you doubt if the definition of evil is correct. The Crucible not only makes you doubt, it makes you scream out loud: ""Who is evil here? """
4,Good but Depressing...,"Ah the finale for the story of Cyric, Mystra, and Kelemvor. This book was interesting to read although a bit...uncomfortable. I say uncomfortable because the book is from the perspective of a follower of Cyric, and thus causes a little confusion to the reader. Hm. The ending however is something that I believe no one expected...quite a bit depressing actually. This is a worthy book overall."
5,Great Old School Inspirations,I love music from back in the day and the Georgia Mass Choir is one of my favorites. No regret
2,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to this movie but felt like the whole thing was a let down. I felt like the movie went at the same pace the whole time and there was no climax.
4,idk,"this is a slow movie, not a lot of dialog, and the werewolf part is silly, but the actresses are both excellent and had some chemistry, which works for me, also i am biassed being i like juno temple so by no means rent this on my review."
3,Werewolf movie - did not expect that,I was not expecting a werewolf movie. For some reason the title reminded me of the JC Mellencamp song but it was not.Okay movie though.
2,Twisted,I understand the perspective of your first love devouring you. But they make this a little to literal for me.
1,terrible,Confusing stories and silly acting is not good don't buy it. Save your money on a four star reviews movies
3,No horror...,I watched this expecting it to be a horror flick and got none. The lesbian love story was nicely acted but it would have been a much better movie without the useless wolf scenes.
2,Filter,"Too much hype, may damage the engine, not recommended by OEM. Just get the OEM filter and save some money. Nice concept though and good workmanship."
1,No music videos,This dvd is a waste of time and money. No music videos makes this a bad experience all around. Its not the way Beavis and Butthead was originally aired.
1,Mostly copied from the CMMI,"I'm working in the quality group of a small company to introduce CMMI and to get assessed.We were very happy when we saw the title ""practical insight"" and bought the book.But we were all very disspointed. Lots of chapters are directly copied, or slightly changed from the CMMI Model, with no more explanation. There is no benefit!We did not find any practical insight in this book.As we are developing our processes we always have the CMMI book open and read the practices. If it happens that we want more information we sometimes check the book from tim, but in most cases the content is exactly the same.It's really not worth the price!"
5,Italian yet Universal,"Ms. Ermelino's book wonderfully captures the essence of an old New York Italian neighbor. Yet her finely drawn characters and their escapades in the '30s, '40s and '60s convey a timeless universality that easily speaks to the reader of any ethnic background. As in her first book, ""Joey Dee Gets Wise,"" Ms. Ermelino's spare style delivers fully and is often laugh-out-loud funny. A terrific read!"
4,enjoyment plus,"since viewing this particular DVD on t.v. oneSunday afternoon, I strived to purchase it as it gave me such pleasure to watch. I found I was singing along with the tunes and enjoyed watching the audience dancing in the aisles.Very toe-tapping music even though semi classical. I recommend it to lovers of semi classical music of all ages."
3,listing of selections for this DVD is incorrect,"Although I enjoyed the DVD, I discovered that Amazons' listing of the songs on this DVD are in error. None of the selections listed are correct. Therefore, I was disappointed, as I did not get what I thought I was ordering."
5,Andre Rieu from Pam,I thoroughly enjoy this DVD and have been playing it constantly since receiving it. I would recommend this DVD to anybody interested in music.
5,Just Great!!!,"I'm not a big fan of this tipe of music, but Andrew Rieu and his musicians put a lot of energy on the concerts that I had to buy this dvd... Totally recommended."
5,Fantastic!,Andre Rieu does not have one bad program. Every one of his vidoes is so very entertaining. This one is fantastic and shows how he relates to every one of his audiences. So enjoyable we watch often.
5,Andre Rieu - Live at the Royal Alber Hall,This video is an excellent concert by an outstanding orchestra. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended.
5,My friend loved it,"I gave this as a birthday gift to a dear friend who loves music, and she is thrilled with it!"
2,Not this version!,"Do not purchase this 2009 version!... It is not the original! My best advice is to purchase the 2002 Version.Why?... Well basically, you will get better definition image, subtitles!!! and much better audio definition!...I bought the original first, and then wanted to give as a gift the new version to my father... Oh surprise, I had to give my father my original one and return the 2009 Version.So, I hope you get the point, you deserve to see Rieu's performance in the original Version!"
3,Its OK,"I have always loved his performances, but after seeing the recent great performances the one at Royal Albert Hall is somewhat stale."
2,Track Listing,"1. What It Feels Like For A Girl (Radio Edit)2. What It Feels Like For A Girl (Tracy Young Cool Out Radio Mix)3. What It Feels Like For A Girl (Calderone & Quayle Dark Side Mix)4. What It Feels Like For A Girl (Richard Vission Velvet Masta Edit)Skip the Part 1 and Part 2 Editions, get the combined edition."
2,"Just the right book title that we need, but tolerable book content","We do need a book on how to trust ourselves. This was the reason why I had read and bought this book.The author tried to explore the natures of trust; but somehow, I found the book 'not a very strong book', boring and hard to finish! Maybe it's just me, but now that I am reviewing the book again, I could not remember anything useful/helpful which I had read and wonder about the value of my time and money!"
4,Enlightening and accessible,"I'm still reading the book but have been impressed with the relaxed prose style, the apt quotes, anecdotes etc. Personally I am finding the message of the book extremely soothing and helpful - it could not have come at a better time for me. If one puts these exercises and mantras into practice, they really can change your outlook and consequently your life."
3,Fittings tend to fail,"The air-bag is fine, but I have had two bags fail at the fitting, it shears off from the bag and cannot be replaced. Also the mounting hardware breaks down over time. I just lost another bag due to the lower bracket deforming and the bag sliding forward into my chains while Elk Hunting. I understand the conditions were extreme, but thats three failures in ten years."
1,No reward for hard work,"This was a big disappointment for my 7 year old son, who had really wanted it for Christmas.First, the gum base was like cement and difficult to work with, so I (the mom) ended up doing all the work. (Perhaps older kids could handle it better). The microwave method didn't work for us (can't melt cement in a microwave) so I used a pot on the stove - and unfortunately, the residual gum stuck and ruined the pot - yet the instructions did not warn me about this!Second, even with the flavoring and sugar we added, the gum tasted pretty awful, and the texture was grainy.I hope Discovery can improve the flavor/texture of the gum base because this is a great concept for kids, and we would love another try!"
2,Fun idea but not really that great,"My kids had a lot of fun making the gum and reading about polymers. The instructions come with some educational reading and fun gum facts. The gum base took a while to melt in the microwave and mixing it wasn't too bad. BUT.. the finished product tasted awful and is pretty much rubber! (Gum is rubber but this wasn't even that soft.) The gum base did ruin a glass bowl of ours, it is like cement!!! It ruins anything it touches. We didn't like the outcome, but it was still a lot of fun for kids who just love doing hand on projects.~Shauna Schoenborn"
5,Fun Book that makes you think,"All pages are in my copy (1996)--nothing missing. No complaints with the book. I am a professional engineer (electrical) and an amateur astronomer who wanted to learn about the celestial sphere so I could better find my way around the night sky using the concepts of declination and right ascension (used by astronomers). I could not have bought a better book. The book does not dumb down the concepts, yet keeps the math simple. If you are an amateur astronomer who has not had an introduction to the celestial sphere, get the book and read it. You'll learn some interesting concepts that will help you understand how to navigate around in the night sky. Cool stuff."
5,Trouble programming your HP48GX? Buy the solution!,"I was trying to program my HP48GX, but it was really difficult, because the manual does not explain programming. I read this book and inmediatly realize that Mr. Coffin not only knows about programming, but he is a great teacher too! He explains the filosophy behind the system and takes you to a very dense but funny tour through this machine. It has plenty of examples and teaches basic and advanced funtions. It helps you make your mind on how it was designed and the way you should direct your programming effort. In one day you will start to make your own programs. It strongly recommend this book. Congratulations to Mr. Chriss Cofinn, because this book is a gift for the reader."
5,Phone Charger,Love it. It works very well. Use it all the time when the phone needs charging. Will order again when needed. Thank You.
2,rapid charger,the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone. very frustrating.
5,My son love Nate the great,"This is a great book. My son is 6 and loves reading this book and feeling like a detective and he even dresses up and goes on hunts for clues like he is Nate the Great. It is also full of basic sight words, to get kids into reading chapter books. The words are easy, but the pages are longer so kids feel that they are reading harder material."
1,Wolcott actually expects us to believe this??,"He says that the main-stream media exhibits a conservative bias. If he thinks that ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, et.al, are lapdogs of the conservative movement then I don't even want to know what he considers ""liberal"". If he thinks that the NY Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune have been kow-towing to George Bush, well, I'd like to know which versions of the Times & Post & Tribune he's been reading 'coz it sure ain't the same ones I see on a daily basis.Typical, though. Take a concept, turn it 180 degrees on its head, & shout it from the rooftops. If you shout it long & loudly enough someone will eventually start to believe it......"
2,Subtext,This is a representation of a CD that is ahead of its tyme i think. I'm not feelin this CD that much...none of the mc's seem to be up 2 par here. I was expecting waayyy better contect and beats on here...but i was dissappointed. The beats on here are str8 weak. It might be worth a listen but not a buy.
2,"Not a detailed ""how-to"" training book","I was really hoping for a book that would provide me with insights into training cockatiels in particular. I was sorely disappointed. Though the book does provide a lot of good, solid, but very general information, a much better book on training parrots is ""The New Parrot Training Handbook"" by Jennifer Hubbard"
3,Step By Step Book on Training Cockatiels,Received book and it helped with some of the basics...My Cockatiel is still in training.....
1,Too Fanatical,I am so glad I took it out at the library before I spent money on it. I found the overuse of the analogy to boxing got old real fast. Very little practical information for the beginner Raw Foodist of the why's and wherefor's. I found it to be entirely too extreme and fanatical. If this had been the first book I ever read on the Raw lifestyle I would have been instantly turned off and gone back to just being vegetarian or stayed with the S.A.D.
2,For a much younger reader!,"I was really disappointed in this book as it was my first attempt to get in touch with raw eating. If you're a 12 yr old with a Karate Kid attitude then this book is for you. Not a good book if you're looking for help with transition to a raw food diet. Very little mention of what you should eat on a raw food program other than the obvious (fresh veggies and fruit), just a lot of caveman hype about what to avoid eating, drinking, smoking or swallowing. And the spelling and grammar were atrocious as well. Sorry Paul, better luck next time."
3,Basic Information,"Basic information slanted more toward someone new to being a raw foodist (or a vegan).Concepts presented in a ""boxing match"" style I found hard to read.Interviews with vets of the raw food lifestyle in second half of the book very interesting but become very repetitious."
3,Good info . . . but so annoying to read.,"The book has really good information, I especially found the interviews very interesting. However the whole time I was reading this book I was as annoyed as if I were in some Japanese Pachinko store. I am not sure why Mr. Nison felt he had to ruin the strong, informative continents with childish gimmicks. But if youre into that sort of read . . . I highly recommend it."
5,good info,"cant go wrong with this one, good information on how and what we should be eating and treating our body/minds, simple and entertaining"
3,haven't used yet,I got this to work with a small generator. hopefully it will operate as expected. how do you rate an extension cord anyway?
3,Not Purchased at Amazon,".I purchased two of these splitters from a Big-box home improvement store and neither of them lasted a year and might have actually burned my house down. Both of the lighted female ends shorted out and burned the plastic; if I hadn't been standing there to unplug the cords, they may have caught on fire.HOWEVER, the faulty splitters from the Big-box store were branded Woods (now a subsidiary of Coleman Cable) and may not have been of the same quality as these sold at Amazon.The three star rating is based only on the fact that these look exactly like the dangerous ones I had before and there is a very close relation between the two manufacturers.After reading the product specifications and the reviews, I'm willing to try this 2-foot splitter and the 25-foot, multi-outlet extension cord, item number 04187 here: [...]I'll use the two items and update as necessary."
4,Yellow Jacket makes good products.,I prefer Yellow Jacket extension cords and this three-prong break-out is a great addition to avoid running multiple cords. I've had no problems with mine and the light-up ends are nice.
4,Extension cord,"It works well, just what we needed. Comes in handy when doing Christmas decorating. Handy in the shop or house."
2,Just started reading this tonight...,"and I've already caught two major errors. I first read the appenix titled ""Broadway on Film.""1) The 1953 film (and stage musical) starring Ethel Merman is Call Me Madam-NOT Call Me Madame.2) Riddle states that State Fair was ""never a stage production."" Again,this is not true. A stage production of the movie musical played the Music Box Theater (a Broadway house) from March 27 (previews began March 20)-June 30, 1996. The copyright for this book is 2004,so there's no excuse for this error. Andrea McArdle and Donna McKechnie were both in the show,so it's not as if it didn't receive any attention.What a disappointment."
5,Good book for a teacher,"I shipped this book to my sister in Romania where she is a PHD professor at the University of Theater Bucharest. She found this book very interesting to expose students to the American musical,its form and its history,to demonstrate the historical development and construction of the American musical by showing the connections between the elements of dance, music, and drama.The American Musical: History & Development"
5,Best Bluegrass Music Collection,"Just push play, sit down and let you feet start clicking or get up and dance. This is a great bluegrass Christmas album!"
3,If you want instrumental....,I searched for quite awhile looking for an instrumental bluegrass Christmas CD. Everyhting I searched pointed me to this CD... however I was greatly disappointed to find only one instrumental cut. From the other posted reviews it sounded as though the CD was mostly instrumental. So if your search for instumental leads you here to this CD.... keep looking!
4,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the regular Cellex C cream and what I received is the Cellex C Plus. They even hand wrote it on the packing slip that I was to get the Plus, but what I ordered was the regular. Other than that, good product and quick delivery."
5,Love the product and a very fair price.,"I've been using this product for a really long time, but this was the best price I've ever gotten. Received it very quickly too. Sealed and brand new."
3,Flavor name should be changed to Orange Zest !,"I like the texture as it's nice and crunchy. My issue is with calling it ""Cranberry Zest"". The ingredients list both orange oil and orange peel and the prevalent flavor is orange. The cranberries in it are very few and the flavor of them is not even discernible.I would never have ordered this had I known I'd be getting orange flavored granola as, though I do like orange, this makes for a very odd combination. They should at least rename this flavor to, if not Orange Zest, Orange-Cranberry Zest so people will know what to expect."
3,better than the first,"Also not 160 pages as it claims and this one lacks any graphics of any type. However, the quality of writing is higher and the types of activities covered are more racy and more provocative. The focus again is on the real life encounters of Nake Magazine readers so the quality of writing is fairly average. How much of this is ""real""? Nothing seems out of the realm of possibility."
5,The Best Fools Be,"I am usually not attacted to ""murder-mystery"" fiction, but this one caught my eye and once into it, could not put it down. An intelligent, thoughtful plot; sprinkled with wonderful quotes - a real page turner. We'll be hearing more from K.B. Morley I believe, and soon I hope!!!"
5,Phish at their best!,"I LOVE THIS SET!This CD is surely to be one of my favorites, and listening to it makes me realize the mistake I made the night it was recorded. I could have been there, but didn't, for some (lame, very lame!) reason. I SURELY would have purchased this CD LONG ago though, had I attended and known it's content.THIS ONE'S A KEEPER!"
4,get for phish originals,"Of the phish live series, this show gets a lot of play in my cd player. But not for the second set. As a matter of fact, i have barely listened to the second set at all. The reason why I enjoy this show is because of the first and third sets(mainly the first for me). The first set is a great, with an amazing divided sky and a gorgeous reba. If anything listen to this show for the reba. You will thank me. Overall, there are others i'd buy before this show, but if you are looking for a few incredible highlights, its worth the money."
5,Recent Phish Fan,"I have only gotten into Phish recently and for my first Phish purchase I figured I would pick out a live show. This would show their energy and fun during performances. Well, they definitely have a lot of that and they showed what a great band they really are. For a first pick I do not think I could have done any better. Their songs are great! These four CD's highlight that by including some of their best overall songs. I especially loved the Beatles tribute. I being a Beatles fan from way back almost love any Beatles song whether played but others or not, but Phish even made some of the songs have a fresh new feel. I loved their version of ""Back in the U.S.S.R"" They are a great band and this live performance shows it."
2,Zzzz,"If you own the White Album, there is no reason for you to own Live Phish 13. If you do not own the White Album there is no reason for you to own Live Phish 13. It does the Beatles no tribute to release this no-energy recreation of their album. It does Phish no tribute to show off their weak vocals."
1,"GARBAGE, PURE AND SIMPLE.","I'll start off by saying I love Phish. And they sometimes do interesting covers of other bands' songs. But this, along with the Quadrophenia set, is nonsensical junk. They simply breeze through each song of the Beatles' White Album note for note. No jams, nothing different. Why would anybody want to hear the White Album played the exact same way by some other band than the Beatles? Hey Phish -- either just play your own stuff or vary your interpretations of other bands' material. Phish fans who laud this are simply in love with the band and can't see their flaws."
1,JUST GET A REGULAR SCREW DRIVER,"This thing is a piece of junk after i bought mine i got about 3 days worth of use out of it before the ratchet started slipping, upon further investigation i found that the ratchet mechanism was actually still good but the handle itself was slipping around the raatchet, I looked a little further and found that there are about 20-30 1/64 inch splines that have been hard molded directly around the handle, well guess what they riped right out of the plastic! Suprise huh. The bit holding device is a very good one but even returning it is a waste of time because the way it is made it is guaranteed to fail again and again. Go to the dollar store and pic up a small medium and large flat and philips set for 3 dollars."
5,Every song is better than the next.I have to get this CD,"I just heard this song on the radio.Madonna is one Artist that keeps on growing with each new record.I have to buy her CD,""Music"" today."
2,This 'Girl' Should Have Been Left Alone,"It is a rare moment when Madonna fails to entrall with her music. I'm a huge fan of Madonna's remixes, and more often than not, she manages to find the most club-savvy artists to tweak her records. Arguably the centerpiece of her current project MUSIC, 'What It Feels Like For A Girl' stands as one of Madonna's finest recorded moments. Unfortunately, some songs occasionally suffer under a remixer's hands, simply because the original IS so original that tampering with it taints it. Tracy Young contributes passable versions of the tune, but far below the great work she did on 'Music' and 'Don't Tell Me'. Richard""Humpty""Vission contributes a remix steeped in retro-disco vibes, with middling results. Only the ""Above And Beyond"" remix shows any real flair, and it's basically a dub mix. Overall, the weakest package from MUSIC to date."
1,One of the most stupidist songs to ever be made to go against the male gender!,"Like one reviewer put this song Is insulting and ridiculous, I thinkwhen she made this song that she never thought twice about a man's point of view with this gender battle crap going on In the world, Equality Is one of the greatest things In the world and she can't seem to percieveIt as that."
5,What it feels like for a girl,"WOW This mix of What it feels like for a girl RULES.Its a deffinite ""gotta have"".The best mix of any Madonna single!"
3,lose the Brittish accent!!,"That's a note to Madonna because it's so annoying to listen to a song with half the lyrics pronounced in a Brittish accent, and half in a regular American accent. Especially since the Brittish words aren't even sung. They're just spoken. And who the heck is ""brother Ashley""? The remixes themselves however, are amazing and really great to listen to."
5,Simply Madonna all-time best CD maxi single,"Madonna's maxi singles have always been ok, but with the MUSIC album, they started becoming essential. What It Feels Like For A Girl followed 2 great maxi singles (Music and Don't tell Me) and even topped both of them in terms of content. These are definitely some of Madonna's best remixes ever done for her. I can listen to this whole disc beginning to end, which I cannot do with some of her other maxi's. Now that says soemthing! My ONLY complaint is that they did not include Paul Oakenfold's Saturday Night mix, in my opinion the BEST WIFLFAG mix. If you haven't heard it, it's promo-only so try to find it. it's really good."
3,Just Bought Ask A Nurse,"This book's information was excellent, but the format usedmade it extremely difficult to focus on the extraordinary information. The author chose to pay homage to each of the nurses for their contributions by constantly giving their names and professional initials with every contribution. This was distracting and made for difficult reading. It would have been so much better if it had been footnoted and the names listed at the end. Most of the readers of this book don't know any of the nurses mentioned (sometimes so many listings on a page that youloose your train of thought). I hope the author will write a new edition with all the names at the end of the text."
4,Does its job,Lost the cable that came with my player. This works fine and I actually like the release mechanism on this one better than the OEM.
5,Beware tear jerkers!!!,"This movie is one Yolanda's greatest performance. It's about twins whoms father, an acoholic and a run-around, left since birth and took the only brother of the twins, leaving the mother to raise the twins on her own and never again to see her only son. As the twins grow up, resulted from a fire set to thier apartment, one twin loses her sight and thier mother dies from a fall. To make a long story short, The one twin who has no sight regains it by running into a man who she falls in love and turns out to be her estranged brother, but she doesn't know till it's all over. Well you will have to see the movie to find out what happens. Ha Ha!! The song tells most of the story."
5,Land of My Heart,I could not put this book down. Wholesome story of a time gone by. I hope there is a sequel and I get the opportunity to read the rest of this touching story. I appreciate all the research that goes into making the characters come alive for the reader.
5,Wonderful read,"I loved this book. After finishing this one, I've purchased the next two in the series. I started on the 3rd book last night. It's a great Christian fiction series."
4,Like it,This was a very good historical adventure romance. It's definitely worth reading. I've actually read the whole series and enjoyed all of it!
4,My kind of book!,I love reading about the taming of the wild west. This book was great and I couldn't wait to finish it.
3,Land of My Heart (Heirs of Montana Book #1),"Diana H. MYERS-- I liked the book. It held my interest, but I didn't love the characters. My favorite part was the wagon train. The author made the journey and trials realistic. But at one point there was too much death faced by the characters. It was like reading a soap opera rather than a novel. I'm not sure if I'll read the sequels."
3,where is the ending,The book just stopped. No kind of ending. Just turned the page and the end. I thought maybe I accidentally touched the wrong button. Like reading a good book and suddenly the last chapter is gone.
4,Montana...God's country,Great book of hope through hard times. A story of faith and perseverance. I really enjoyed reading DIanne's story and the journey to maturity with God.
5,Great Book!,The book series is a must! I read the fourth one first and then bought the rest. I was so intrigued with what happened to some of the characters I wanted to find out from the start what had taken place. A great read with wonderful inspirational help throughout the books.The characters bring realistic problems into a wonderful story that in based in beautiful country.
3,"it was ok, good descriptions","Certainly not a deep read, but Montana country and era descriptions were good. Sort of a romance type book, not a mystery"
4,Another fine book by Tracie Peterson,If you are a fan of historical fiction I would highly recommend reading this book. Well written using historical facts.
3,Land Of My Heart,The story was interesting describing the difficulties a wagon train presented but the ending appeared inappropriate to the rest of the story line.
3,"Death, Death, Death","This author must have been in a bad mood or likes to write depressing books. By the time the fifth person in Diana's life had died, I gave up on the book. I was tired of the author killing everyone off. Some of these character's lives could have taken another turn then death. I will not waste any more of my time reading this to see who dies next."
4,Take a pioneer's trip from the settled area of the nation in the 1860's to the wild west!,An interesting visit to the era of wagon trains taking families to the western states. Story is well told and has some suspense written in interestingly!I have yet to finish it since I have just undergone cataract surgery on both eyes! I will complete my reading soon!
5,Amazing....,"I couldn't put this book down! It made me want to find a way to travel back in time and know Dianne and Cole and all the characters. All the characters were likable in one small way or another. The message of God`s love and the way He wants to be ""our friend"" helped me so much and opened my eyes to the fact that I need to talk to my Friend more so I can get closer to Him. Just what I needed to hear at this point in my life. Thank you for sharing this story with us!"
2,Land of my beauty,I liked this book because it brought back memories of Wyoming and mountains to me . It teaches that God grace is always with us and through his love all things are possible.
1,Where,"Is the rest? It just ended.....leaving the reader saying what the heck, I feel like I just wasted two days for nothing"
1,Unrealistic drama,"Sorry, but the plot is not real. Sophomoric in approach. I am very disappointed as this book was part of a series. Returned this book and do not plan on buying the other three."
3,book review,It passes the time when I can't sleep at night. I can read at night in bed without the light disturbing my husband.
2,Not for avid romance readers.,I haven't read much by Tracie Peterson but i was definitely expecting a little more romance in this book. There was so many sad events it was abnormal. I thought it was pretty boring and i didn't even end up finishing it.
4,Hard Times,"Things fall apart from the very beginning in this book, but the need to trust God is clearly stressed throughout the entire story.The story holds your interest even though it is sad and this family can't seem to get a break.I loom forward to reading book two of the Heirs of Montana series."
5,Review,"The book was very interesting and details the struggles, both physical and spiritual, of a moving family. Exciting good story."
4,A Challenging read.... but keep reading.,"In this historical fiction, Dianne loses a great deal in her quest to better the lives of her mother and siblings. She urges them to travel across the country in a wagon train to the new Montana Territory, but in the process, she loses much. Some loss comes by death, some by distance, some by a distant heart..... but will she find herself and what she loves most? Just when resolution seems eminent, a cliffhanger......At times, I thought I could read no more, but I couldn't put it down!"
3,I don't know,"I picked this book up three times at the library and each time just couldn't get into it. I finally said I would read it, and when I did, I wished that I hadn't. I love Tracie Peterson as a writer (she is my favorite author), and would never want to put her down, but this book was just too sad to handle. It does get a lot better near the end, but the beginning and part of the middle is just too much misery in one book. And the worst thing about this is that my friend told me that the sequal is almost just as sad. Now I started a series and I don't know if I am willing to pick up the second book. But please don't let this stop you from reading it. It is really good and people have different likes and dislikes about books."
4,Good read,The characters in this book make you want to be a better person. I loved the strength of Diane and Cole. I want to know more about them. Thank you Tracie.
3,Loved it!,"Could not put it down. Very entertaining. Did not want it to end, wished it was longer. Will look for more books by this author."
3,It was fine.,I like Tracie Peterson books but this one dragged a bit in my opinion. I felt like it got really slow and just wasn't as great as some of her other works. It was fine.
4,Loved Land of my heart,Want to read rest of series. Want to find out what happened to Trenton. Loved that salvation was so important
3,I like character development ...,But within a short time of reading I was painfully aware of the author's informing of this or that character's mannerisms and their import. And often a passage was heavily burdened with historical info which became droning in my mind. Wasn't my cup of tea. Sorry!
4,Land of My Heart,"I enjoyed the book a lot, one of the reasons being it was clean reading (no foul language and no vulgarity). The writer has the ability to put the reader on the scene."
4,Land of my heart,"The story is touching. I can relate on it. Portraying the reality of life and teaching you how to cope with hard, unexpected trials."
3,Okay,I like a bit of sex in a book and this was a little lame. Good story line and very believable for the time
4,Land of my heart,I liked this book a lot. If u enjoy books of the frontier u will enjoy as much as I did.
4,Very good book.,"I liked this book very much. However, I resent Amazon forcing me to write a specific number of words. If I like the book, I like it. That should be enough."
3,Wouldn't call it a romance,"Great story line, although I wouldn't classify this as a romarnce. The romance story didn't really start till the book was 90% over. If you are looking for a historical fiction to grow your faith you may enjoy this, but if it's a love story you are desiring you'll be disappointed."
2,Way to much religion,Somewhat anti climactic. What became of Trevor the older brother? Did he make it out of KC alive? Did he go to Montana? One twin joined the army. What became of the other twin? To much left to the imagination.
2,Disappointing vehicle for proselytizing,"Now I know why this book was free. The story of a young woman on a pioneer wagon train interested me. What I got was a story with absolutely no character development, no emotional connections and every setback an excuse to proselytize ""take God/Jesus into your heart"". Maybe life in the 1860's was that bleak and emotionless, but if I am going to read a book, I want a little more than scenes and characters strung together with no meaning or connection. I guess it was just a setup for the rest of the series which I will pass on, even if free."
3,Good but long,Very good storyline but too long and drawn out. I also didn't like the fact that her sisters and mother died. She could have at least let the baby love. It took too long for her and Cole to find love.
2,Bit of a disappointment,"The good: The slow building romance between Cole and Dianne was nice and I really enjoyed the fact Dianne was a strong, willing-to-work female. Personally, I liked the religious aspect of it and how they turned to God but I could definitely see how some could call it preachy.The not so good: so much misery and pain. I realize it was not a bed of roses journeying west but enough already. Too many descriptions made the story drag and I nearly stopped reading it several times. Too many things left hanging. Apparently there's a book 2 but I don't want to be forced to read subsequent books to find out what happened.Bottom line: I was disappointed in the ending and as I said, I don't want to HAVE to read book 2 to see what happened to Evan, Trenton and where Cole and Dianne ended up."
