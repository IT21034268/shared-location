5,To know her name,I thought this book was great. It kept my interest through out. I didn't like putting it down. I recommend it.
4,Thorn Birds,I never watched the series and always wondered what all the fuss was about. The book is very entertaining and I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting read that is set in Australia. The book is well written and most enjoyable. I also bought the audio book so I could keep the book moving while in the car.
2,The ebook is riddled with typos,"My Kindle version of The Thorn Birds is riddled with distracting typos. Some are really odd, like a comma in the middle of a word. Others are just scrambled letters within words or two words stuck together. And a few have resulted in entire paragraphs that make no sense at all because several key words have been left out. Pretty disappointing. What's going on? Are printed books scanned into ebook format and then not checked to see if there was 100% success?"
4,A reading adventure,"This sweeping saga, told from so many different perspectives, continues to fascinated, intrigue, and captivate after 30+ years. The parallel problems of the successive generations, with their central theme of forbidden love, add layer upon layer of pain to the dysfunctional Cleary family.Despite the endless trials of Meggie, the story's central character, it is Father Ralph that we truly feel for. Meggie is not a likable enough character to really sympathize with, which I feel is the book's main drawback. But overall, this epic novel is wonderfully engaging.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"
5,The Thorn Birds - An Epic Novel,"Last night I finished The Thorn Birds, and I thought that..along with being one of the best novels i've ever read..it provides us with an insight into human behavior and emotion. After reading hundreds of books in my sixteen years, i thought there wouldn't be another book to really interest me in the way that Koontz and Grisham do.This book has it all. Family drama, heartbreak, and such strong female characters that are usually absent in a lot of books today. I especially feel sad for Meggie and the Cardinal, Ralph de Bricassart, because they cannot express their love because Ralph is tied to his duties to the Catholic Church.If you're going to read a book, make sure this is one on your list!"
5,Thorn Birds; Review,"This novel is one of tragedy, romance, and the undaunting human spirit. It is a richly woven tale somewhat reminiscint of 'A Tree Grows In Brooklyn'. Set in the Australian outback, it follows the Cleary family through drought, flood and death, focusing mainly on the lone daughter, Meggie. Meggie falls in love with a Catholic priest, who in turn must reject her or risk breaking his vows. It is a must-read for anyone interested in Australia, for it offers a behind-the-scenes look at the true Outback life from the 1920's right up through the 60's. I loved this book."
4,Interesting point of veiw....,"I enjoyed this book for the fact that I felt that it depicted reality. I think that no matter how much we try to disillusion ourselves, this was very correct at portraying a typical, yes typical, family. I see examples every day of people that have the same qualities as all the characters in the book. Meggie can't let go, or just doesn't want to, Fee can't either. She can't forget about Frank or Frank's father. The only character that I think was rather weak was Dane. Nobody is like that. He was just too perfect. Sadly enough I was rather glad at his end."
2,"Classify under ""Romance""","If you're looking for a long, romantic yarn, this is a pretty decent one. The writing is quite good--you can feel the dust and heat of Australia, as it works its way under your skin. And you feel for the protagonist; you feel for a woman who has few options in life, and who's life is inevitably chained to one man or another.Although I'm very sympathetic to this position, I felt a little bit lost inside of this woman's mind, and felt that her men were caricatures, rather than developed characters. I wanted to be a part of her thinking, but this bias in the writing threw me off.In the end, after hundreds of pages and a bit too much saga, we are to rejoice that her chains have become easier. It's a little hard to swallow. I don't think this qualifies as a feminist work. I'd tell men to skip this one altogether, and advise readers that this is, ultimately, just a well-written romance novel, for better or for worse."
3,Read the book,I just didn't like most of the characters but found reading the book more satisfying.Celibacy is unnatural-in my opinion and has created a lot of grief for the religions that demandit.
5,Great Book,I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it tremendously. Loved it so much I wanted to have it on Kindle.
2,The Thorn Birds,Very disapointed with quality pages were falling out and no where no where did it inform me that there is volume 2 out there that I can not find by the way.
1,Only got 1/2 of book!,"Evidently The Thorn Birds is such a long book that for the large print edition it was published in two parts.Upon purchase, I only received Part 2. This was not explained in the purchase information."
5,I defy anybody who does not like this book....,The Thorn Birds is absolutely one of the greatest epics of our time. McCullough's genuis prose is unparalled and the romance between Ralph and Meggie ranks up there with Scarlett and Rhett. It is a smashing good read. My only complaint is that I can read it only once for the first time.
3,Wasn't expecting a full blown romance novel,"I've read all of Colleen's Masters of Rome series and thought they were great but found this one to be a disappointment. I had to struggle to even finish the book which I found to be sappy and superficial compared to her fairly hard-boiled and intricately detailed politico-military portrayal of Rome. I admit I am no fan of romances, but I believe her writing skills have improved considerably in her later books."
4,Great novel...Until the End,"This is a great novel all the way until about the last 100 or so pages. This is when the book begins to focus on Justine, a very unlikeable character. I found myself just wishing that it would hurry up and be over. The first 500 or so pages are a great story though! If you are looking for something easy to read and not too dramatic this is it."
3,Admirable Effort,"This book is so bittersweet - isn't that the way of life? Ms. McCullough has weaved an intricate, captivating tale. The story was extremely compelling, dramatic, and tragic. The cursed love affair of Meggie and Ralf digs at the thorns all readers surely have in their own sides. As a Protestant, I was enthrawlled by the spiritual issues grappled with through Catholic theology. I so admire Ms. McCullough taking on such an epic story that it pains me to give it only 3 stars, but I did for the following reasons: 1. The last third of the book falls flat as the climax (Ralf and Meggie) occured too soon and Justine couldn't hold it together on her own. 2. I am a huge fan of description and detail, but the detail in this book became tedious at times. 3. Because the book spanned 60 years, it was hard at times for me to feel connected to the characters when say 8 years had passed without any knowledge of what had been going on in their lives. But on the whole, a very admirable effort!"
5,One of My All Time Favorites,"The Thornbirds is one of my favorite novels; I have read and re-read it multiple times. The book is a love story, a family story, a life story. It is a tragic story that does end on a hopeful note. It is a ""must read!"""
2,Predictable Characters,"I read this book when it was first published, to see what all the hoopla was about. I found the story predictable. The characters never came to life for me. They repeated their words over and over throughout life. This behavior is true of people in real life, but it's boring in fiction. This book created no sparks for me."
3,I can't really decide if I like it or not...,"I loved the attention to detail, but it got grueling sometimes. I felt sometimes that the author was skimping on the characters themselves, but it was a great story. I was never quite sure whether or not I even liked the majority of the characters until the end of the book. This has really made me asses about what my feelings on love and God are."
4,Great CD,I had this CD when it first came out and somewhere down the road it got lost. I had forgot about it until my daughter reminded me of it. I plan to reorder it. Smooth music with nice vocals. Barbara is also a good pianist.
5,how did they do that?,"just the same great tasting Miracle Whip that I have used for years, but how did they develop this new bottle that empties completely? No kidding...as you squeeeze this bottle, the product doesn't stick to the sides like so many condiments do...when it's empty, it's COMPLETELY empty...absolutely NO waste...!!"
3,Wrong size,"This is the second one and it still was the wrong size but it was not amazon's fault. My husband decided to keep it becasue he can use it somewhere else,"
1,an ideological approach to history,"The worst sort of ""academic"" or ""scholarly"" pursuit: one that begins with certain assumptions it endeavors to prove. Bennett has intimated on his radio show that he composed this book in response to Howard Zinn's ""People's History"" texts. Bennett's work is elitist with racist overtones. It is political and historical hagiography. The ""feel good"" history of the year. But not an honest, critical approach to the subject."
5,MUST HAVE,"This is simple to review - get it and learn about our country, history, and the forces that continue to shape us today.MUST HAVE."
2,Disappointing...,"If you blindly worship Alexander Hamilton and Abraham Lincoln, this book is for you! Unfortunately, its not for me... I was very disappointed with the statist and religious agenda in this book. I gave it two stars because it does have a lot of interesting facts, but its mostly a neo-conservative view of American history."
3,Okay overview of American history,"This is a good book for anyone who either has little grasp of the main points of US history from 1492 to 1914, or for someone who's forgotten all that high school US history. But I thought it spent too much time on trivial facts, such as electoral and popular vote results of each and every presidential election, at the expense of facts that might have been more relevant and enlightening -- for example, a good explanation of the electoral college and why it was and still is in use. Similarly, the book mentions the votes and veto of the Chinese Exclusion Act, but completely neglects to explain what the Act was (I know all about it, but I bet a lot of readers are not familiar with it).So definitely worth a read, but with the caveat that it might leave the reader wanting a more thorough history of the US."
2,Superficial History,"Mr. Bennett's book is a good start for the beginning history student, but it is very superficial, and demonstrates that one cannot do a thorough job of discussing the period from Columbus to World War I in a single volume. At several points, the superficiality is extremely detrimental. For example, it glosses over Madison's changing views on the propriety of secession, fails to give the opposing view on Webster's ""we the people"" argument, takes a one-sided view on Andrew Johnson and Reconstruction, and sugarcoats the racism of Woodrow Wilson. At one point, the book is simply annoying. In one chapter, Mr. Bennett repeatedly uses the word ""principal"" when ""principle"" is the correct term."
5,Everyone's Favorite History Book,"Reading this book is like unrolling a scroll and discovering it is actually a treasure map. The more you read, the more you realize that this country is absolutely unique. America is the treasure and too valuable to toss off as a failed experiment. There is no other like it."
4,Easy Read,I found this book to be an easy read. I found it easy to understand and keep up with. The book was only recommended to read by the professor. Yet it was so interesting that I found myself reading it even though I did not have too.
4,Fixing revisionist's version of history,"Great read! This book corrects much of the garbage about American history that is taught to our kids in the public schools. It is an insightful, interesting book that takes you from it's discovery to adolescent America. Every parent should read this to help their kids learn the real history of America. I can't wait for volume 2."
2,A crash course in American history,The book gives a decent overview of pre WW1 American history. As it covers a long period and a lot of historic events the analysis is somewhat superficial.The greatest drawbacks are the partisan discussion of politics and attempts to link political players from the 19th century to today's parties.
3,Very good.,"I think all Americans should know how our great nation came to be, and what is happening now to threaten it's sovereignty and constitution. Since 911, we have been to willing to give up our freedom and prosperity in hopes of some security. Now our economy, our republic, the balance of power between national govt. branches, and our constitutional liberties and values are being rapidly eroded in the name of the ""war on terror"". I highly recommend Ron Paul's book, Revolution: A Manifesto. We must set a good example for the rest of the world by following our constitution, not interfere with the internal affairs of other nations, such as imposing sanctions, puppet governments, much less threaten massive war on those who ""might"" have weapons of mass destruction!"
4,Why is this Book Out Of Print???,"I'm only half-way thru. Had the book for like 5 years on my shelf, from sci-fi book club. Read the other reviews at the office today, as I was searching for a sequel already. Wow! Great hard sci-fi (as others have said). Actually great hard-core Sci-fi. Hats off to the author. I recommend the academic work, Pluto and Charon, which I read a couple of years ago. Great companion reading, I'd say. Can't wait to get the sequel already."
4,Deserves 4.5 to be fair.,"First of all this is a good book. a very good one. It is not exellent because it lacks something in the more human side, what is called ""soft"" sci-fi. To say the truth, i cant really put my finger on it, but i sense it. On the ""hard"" side, i can find no flaw. his knowledge is extensive and super-uptodate, and is well-writen. It's a book to be read, if you consider yourself a serieus hard sci-fi fan."
2,The Dark Half 2,"The acting was great, the music was great, but the story was very similar to ""The Dark Half"". I wasn't at all suprised by the so-called ""surprise ending""."
2,Big disappointment,"What a big disappointment. The trailer looks cool, it's got Jonny D but oh oh oh...no. What a poor film.Give it a missTone"
2,Ehhh not bad but not that good,"This movie wasn't the worst I've ever seen but it wasn't that great either. I will admit the only reason I rented it was to see Mr. Depp, but I doubt I'm alone in that. The story is just boring. Someone told me this was a scary movie but I did not see that at all. I figured out the whole surprise 'twist' if you want to call it that before it was revealed. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor but even he couldn't save this one. I will give credit to some parts of the movie that did keep me interested but these were very few and far between. Not Johnny Depp's greatest but if you are a hardcore Depp fan its worth the price of admission."
4,secret window,"I found this movie to be hilarious, im sure it wasnt intended to be so, but it also had very good acting in it. Johnny was superb as always, the movie has a good wit about it (mostly on Johnny's part) and it kept you guessing. It isnt boring and it keeps you entertained. i give it a four out of five."
4,Secret Window,"This was a pretty good movie,though I was expecting it to be better.The first hour and a half or so, it was very good and suspenseful,but in the last 20 minutes, it just gets really weird and the style of the movie seems to change all of a sudden.The ending reminded me of an ending to another movie that came out a few months ago but I won't mention what it is in case I give away the ending for this movie.Overall, this was a pretty good thriller,but it gets pretty strange towards the end."
5,"Do NOT listen to the ""professional"" critics!","I am one of those who never pays attention to any critics review of a movie, after all, I'm not them, so how can they say whether they think I will like a movie? I had started to read the story by Stephen King, but stopped part-way through to see the movie so I wouldn't ruin the ending. I needn't have worried because the movie didn't end the same way. Check out the book, it's an additional treat. This movie has an excellent story, which is a writer, recently separated from the love of his live, battling writer's block and jealousy of the ex's new boyfriend, who is holed up all alone with only his dog and his thoughts in a remote summer house. What he goes through is a wonderful story and a joy to watch, and Johnny Depp plays it perfectly!"
2,"Unsuspenseful, crappy ending but nice performance from Depp","I like Stephen King's writing quite a bit. He knows what is truly scary: gutter-dwelling clowns, children, zombie pets, and menacing machines. Unfortunately, when King's stories make the leap from the page to the screen, they often lose their psychological suspense. Perhaps it's because the tension of King's stories come from what takes place within the protagonist's mind rather than external forces.Another difficulty is that King can write amazingly tense stories with endings that go flat. For example, IT was truly scary...creepy clowns...scary sounds coming from the sewer...but it turns out to be a giant spider? Not so scary.""Secret Window"" is another attempt to bring one of King's novellas to the screen, but it falls flat because it lacks suspense and has a poor ending you can see from a mile away. I'm not a particular fan of Johnny Depp; however, it's Depp's skill as an actor that saves this movie from being a waste of time."
3,2 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:Secret Window is a pointless whodunnit that delights in twists and turns for the sake of twists and turns; too bad the ending is a complete cliche that leaves the viewer distinctly dissapointed.
2,worst kept secret,"I'll willingly watch pretty much anything with Johnny Depp in it. He's in fine form in this one, portraying a floundering, misdirected writer who is confronted by a mysterious and violent stranger, ""Shooter,"" [Torturro] accusing him of plagiarism. But even Depp's facial tics, quirky mannerisms, and off-beat portrayal can't save this movie, because I figured out the plot in about 15 minutes and spent the remaining 81 minutes waiting for the inevitable conclusion. This film ventures into the realms of Angel Heart and Mulholland Dr., but can't really win either way, and the cinematic clichés about the hermetic, weirdo writer who can't separate fiction from reality are way too familiar and way too stale. We've seen all of this before, and we've seen it done better."
2,Plumbing the Depp-ths,"I enjoyed this up to the last part, which is predictable if you're expecting the story to turn out to be a bust, but disappointing if you're expecting something interesting. Johnny Depp is splendid until the end where he turns into Norman Bates. I'm not a Stephen King fan, and this movie did not make me a convert. On the plus side, the setting is wonderful, and Depp's portrayal of a man going through the agony of divorce and self-doubt is compelling."
4,Good Movie,"Secret Window is a good movie. It's not hard to get, but you have to pay attention to the details. It's not real scary, The only thing that scares you is the expectation of what's going to happen next. Secret Window also has an ending that you would never expect. This movie wasn't the best movie I ever seen but still a very good movie!"
2,"Adequate, at best","I remember seeing this movie before when it was called ""The Shining."" I liked that one better.The paper-thin story is derivative at best. One of the story elements that I particularly don't care for is the Omniscient, Omnipotent Villain (OOV). And the OOV is definitely a main feature of this film. The ""twist"" is not particularly surprising, although it does show a bit of directorial flair absent from the remainder of the movie. Further, the pacing of this movie, which I'm sure was characterized by the studio as ""deliberate,"" descends beyond that into ""tedious.""The performances can't be faulted; they are all very good. In particular, Johnny Depp carries this entire film on his shoulders. I suspect this would have been a one-star film with anyone but Depp in the lead role. However, great performances alone can't carry the entire weight of a movie, and this one collapses on the shaky foundation of its script."
2,get me rewrite,"Coming on the heels of Depp's Oscar nomination, this overwrought trifle was a real disappointment. No complaints about Depp's performance--although he is almost upstaged by the most annoying hairstyle since Keanu Reeves' in Prince of Pennsylvania. The real problem here is Stephen King's story-- a weak variation on Misery that might have worked as an hour-long episode on the old Alfred Hitchcock Presents but just seems absurd blown up into a mutli-million dollar feature.One giant plot hole spoils whatever crediblity the story might have had: With all the instant information retrieval available today via the Internet, why on earth does Depp spend half the movie trying to prove he published a story in a magazine just 10 years ago? Yeah, I know. It's only a movie--but it sure ain't much of one."
4,SEEEEECRet Windown,"This movie would have been utterly terrible without Johnny Depp in the starring role. If you are seeing this movie for the first time, try not to think too much about what will happen. Otherwise, it is pretty obvious to predict what will happen.Depp plays a quirky writer who is in the middle of a divorce. He had caught his wife cheating on him. A man named John Shooter harasses Depp about plagiarism and things begin to get very violent. Depp creates an entertaining charachter out of a fairly boring role.As the plot unfolds, people die and the story takes very strange turns. Even though this movie is not the greatest, it is still a must see.The music and cinematography are good in the film. The acting is sup par besides the performances of Johnny Depp and John Turturro. This movie deserves and eight out of ten."
5,Good!,"It is such a good movie, it has suspense and a nice twist to it. It kept you guessing and it kept me on the edge of my seat for sure. I love Johnny Depp too, he is such a fantastic actor, I really enjoyed his role in this movie. Timothy Hutton and John Turturro are both in the movie as well."
5,stunning look and acting,"i love this ""fantastic"" movie.this is the 1st role i found confirmation in depp's beauty and talent.depp's subtle yet profound presence is felt in each scene. subtlety is not often found in king's stories.fast paced yet drawn out, this movie is underrated and is or certainly will be a cult classic. in this movie, i find johnny depp gorgeous, stylish and sublime.joannaha.com"
3,Secret Window,"A good DVD. Johnny Depp gives one of his better performances in this creepy little movie. The story is vintage Stephen King and bears some similarities to The Shining. The bonuses included four deleted scenes which were interesting to see, but I don't think anybody really misses them from the movie. The best bonus in my opinion was the animated storyboards of the opening credits and the garden. A nicely made movie."
3,Dark Half 2???,"This movie is just like The Dark Half.. If you haven't seen it yet, and would like to see and newer version of the plot then pick this movie up."
3,Secret Window,"Johnny Depp pulls off a great performance in this thriller. This movie had a pretty neat twist but it was pretty easy to figure out, especially after already watching Fightclub. I enjoyed the way Depp drove the movie and it wasn't as jumpy as I thought. I would give the movie a 2.5 stars of 5. I watched it because my dad borrowed it from a friend. It really didn't seem to stand out from other mystery thrillers I've seen. Depp plays a disturbed writer who has a fan come to his lakefront property claiming that Depp had plagiarized his work. Depp and his ex-wife have a pecular role because she cheated on him but he doesn't want to leave her. The movie is a little disturbing. I would recommend for mature audience. It does have some graphic images."
2,"bad, predictable story","My first big problem with this movie was that the story is simply stupid. A guy approaches Johnny Depp, short story writer, and accuses him of stealing his story. He threatens to start hurting Depp's loved ones if he doesn't rewrite the story properly. I had a hard time caring. It seemed to be so much revolving around so little, and the movie was so poorly written and predictable that I didn't care about any of it. Finally, when the big twist was revealed, it didn't make sense with everything that had happened in the movie.When the movie was over, I felt dumber for having watched it. I give it two stars for Johnny Depp's performance, which made the movie at least somewhat enjoyable. However, I still would not recommend watching it."
4,The descent into madness,"Johnny Depp stars as writer Mort Rainey living in seclusion in a lakefront residence in upstate New York after having been estranged from his wife Amy, played by Maria Bello. Depp is licking his wounds from the discovery of his wife having an affair in a motel room with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton.The Steven King created storyline gets weird almost immediately when Depp gets an unexpected visit from Southern drawling stranger John Shooter played by John Turturro. Turturro alleges that Depp has plagiarized a story he had written and threatens him. In short order everything surrounding Depp begins to become destroyed. He asks for and gets help from detective type Ken Karsch played by Charles Dutton but the tragedies keep on occuring.In typical King fashion, the storyline gets a jolting twist when we discover that both Depp and Turturro may not be exactly what we think they are. ""Secret Window"" was an entertaining but not especially noteworthy investment of 96 minutes."
3,Another cliched thriller!,"There is only one word to describe this movie: weird. Johnny Depp makes this movie, however, the plot stinks. It was confusing and weird. The trailer makes the movie seem spooky and scary, but it was not. I didnt jump or get scard once. Coming from the writer of ""Panic Room"", I was expecting a lot more but i got a lot less. DO NOT waste your time with this stinker of a movie. It was more like a NBC mini- series."
1,Cheap attempt (SPOILER ALERT),"I dont know how in the world the producers thought they could get away with this. It was FIGHT CLUB done all over again. From about half way through the movie, it dawned on me... (smoking the same cigarette brand...) but I was hoping otherwise... but nope... that was it... they took FÍGHT CLUB'S dramatic ending and duplicated it. I felt so played... a really cheap and vile feeling. Jees... and FIGHT CLUB was only made a few years ago... the merry go round is getting shorter and shorter these days!Unfortunately Johnny Depp did well... too bad.I'd rather watch FIGHT CLUB again."
1,just awful,"The story is awful, Depp is pretty irritating and the ending is a quick get out to stop the dire plot. Dont waste your money or time on this movie, I'm amazed Hollywood is still churning out utter rubbish and the stars are making these movies, dont be fooled by the names! dont buy it!"
2,"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT","Stephen King story about a frustrated writer should tell you all you need to know about this dormant suspense thriller from the ""Sixth Sense"" school of logic. It plods along until it's not so surprising climax with little distinction between it and other similiar movies. Johnny Depp is cool, the film is not."
2,Secret Window was a disappointment,I was disappointed. It was too predictable toward the end. Johnny Depp was good. But the show had violence that wasn't necessary and wasn't really scary. Too predictable.
3,"*sigh* Johnny, I love you, but...","...this movie wasn't very fantastic. As everyone said, if Johnny hadn't been in this movie, it would have been a straight-to-video type...but it might turn out that way anyway. Poor Johnny...his new movie was so bad. So predictable, so silly...oh well. Poor Johnny. See it if you love Johnny. Otherwise, wait a few months and it'll be showing on HBO. :KPros: Johnny...and Johnny.Cons: Predictable.Summary: Bad."
3,depp carried it,sadly this movie was not what i hoped. i guessed the whole movie before i even saw it! depp did really great acting [at his best] but the script didnt give him anything to work with....sadly it didnt deliver...o well...
1,Wins for most boring movie with the most boring acting,"I wish I could have seen this whole movie but J.Depp combined with a very slow start forced me to turn it off in the first 15 minutes. The people who liked this movie must be very patient types. I on the other hand was bored to tears. Did I say this movie was a bore? I like Tarantino flicks and movies like ""Fargo"" and ""Goodfellas""."
2,Much ado about nothing,"Johnny Depp is a great actor, no doubt. And Stephen King has written some good scary stuff. Add the music from Philip Glass and what can go wrong?Well, basically the problem is that this is really a quite short story that could be told in thirty minutes. And even as a short story, i's quite forgettable. (Stephen King has written some boring stuff too.)Depp plays a slightly paranoid writer who, living in a cabin while he is getting divorced from his wife, meets a man that accuses him of plagiarism and if I tell you anything more I risk giving to much away since there aren't too many things happening in this film...About one funny scene, never engaging or exiting - let alone scary - it's not worth you while."
2,Keep This Window Closed...The Flys Are Getting In,"Oh, my, my, my, my. Johnny Depp in a quirky role. Who would have guessed? It is a shame to see good actors in a very predictable plot. Not much suprise here. In the first 10 minutes you will figure out this ""gimmicky"" movie. I'm really tired of these gimmicky movies. What ever happened to straight out suspense and drama, well written thrillers with tight direction? This is slickly produced, looks real good. Eye candy as it were. Nothing much else, a real disappointment to say the least. You'll get more suspense from a Pay-Less Shoe Store sale."
5,Highly under-rated movie,"Great, great movie! I can't tell you anything about the plot because you just must see it for yourself, but I can tell you that it is based on one of Stephen King's books, so it's going to be a thriller. Also, Johnny Depp is an acting god as far as I'm concerned, and he does a great performance in this movie, as in all movies he takes on. He is so believable and real. I totally did not see the end coming, even with all the clues, so I was slammed at the end. See it, it's good. Not sure how this one slipped through the cracks."
4,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","Secret Window brings to the screen an adaptation of another of Stephen King's books; this one about a series of crimes that take place in the life of author/writer Mort Rainey, played by Johnny Depp.Though not a masterpiece, Secret Window is a good movie, guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment. The casting is very good, and the story very well written.Nevertheless, it lacks that something to put it over the top. After seeing The Others and The Sixth Sense, it becomes a bit predictable, though Stephen King has not lost his touch in providing an unexpected ending.In addition, there is a slight hint of Misery in the Secret Window, what with the writer/author in the middle of nowhere and all.Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, even though you might not want to go the extra mile and purchase it."
2,Why is it when stars make it to the A list...,"Why is it when stars make it to the so called A list, they get involved with horrible films? Johnny Depp is probably my favorite actor of all time. If you want to see some of his great work, watch Jim Jermarsch's (spelling) Dead Man, this was a great western or the 9th Gate another great film.But back to Secret Window, this movie started off very well, however it became very predictable Shortly after the stranger shows up. I knew where they were going, but I hoped I was wrong. I thought ""Please don't go there."" But of course they did and that as they say is that. The acting in this film was excellent however so it gets 2 stars, but I really could not recommend anyone wasting money renting it. I hope JD doesn't stop appearing in great works. I'd like to see him work with Jim J again and also David Lynch, but that will never happen."
2,"so long, mr king","Borrowing liberally from The Shining and a bit from Misery, this watered down and tale is full of surprisingly bad dialogue-stuff which must have been taken directly from the Stephen King story on which it was based, for King often demonstrates an inability to write dialogue that doesn't feel written-and has one truly awful performance (Charles Dutton). It's the kind of movie you figure out early and then you wait for the twist that is going to make it all up to you, but no such twist ever comes. Most reviewers give kudos to Depp for his performance, but it seems an Emperor's New Clothing type accolade-there is nothing extraordinary about it. It's not a tedious film, but it reminds one that King has grown increasingly irrelevant, his works are dated, that Koepp really isn't much of a director, and that good performers still take rolls in what they must know are going to be bad films."
2,Disappointing,I saw the personality problem coming a mile away. How many times are we going to do this story? I bet you this would have been a great read but the movie was predictable. Johnny Depp was awesome as usual of course.
3,hard to figure out whats really happening and whats not,"After Johnny Depp shot to Mainstream movie stardom as swashbuckler Captain Jack Sparrow, he starred in the suspense thriller ""Secret Window"" it was good movie, but some things were hard to figure out if they were really happening, like writing ""shooter"" many different times, going insane attacking his wife and did Johnny kill all the people and his dog and not even know it, because the stalker is not real. Mabye I have to see it again, well and it is a Steven King novel, his books are confusing or so I've heard. give this a try and see what johnny does for you in this more and more confusing thriller.""what do you want from me"""
4,A quiet surprise,"While I wouldn't exactly call this movie suspenseful or scary, I really enjoy watching it. I think what makes it most enjoyable for me is the acting. Johnny Depp does a fabulous job as writer Mort Rainey, and John Turturro gives an unforgetable performance as well. The two of them hold the movie together for me.Don't see this movie expecting to be glued to the edge of your seat with your heart in your throaght, jumping out of your skin at the slightest noises. I also don't think that there is anything new or innovative about this particular film. What you have here is something that is quite nicely done acting-wise, especially if you enjoy Johnny Depp's and John Turturro's work, and moves along well. I'd call it a quiet surprise."
4,Duality,"I watched this movie for this first time a few years ago when it was initially released on DVD. As a horror movie, I felt it fell flat. It featured lots of building up to scares that usually were not that noteworthy. The ending surprised me and I concluded that because I knew the twist at the end, I felt that I would never be able to enjoy watching it again.And that's where I was wrong. This movie gets better upon follow up viewings, especially noting the duality in meaning to everything Shooter says. The scene where Johnny Depp accidentally smashes the mirror is a thing of beauty. This is a great psycho-traumatic thriller and I highly recommend it."
2,Seen it all before,"These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance?"
4,"An Entertaining Film, Worth A Rent","Secret Window is an entertaining film. David Koepp (Stir of Echoes) directs the movie beautifully with a well written script. Johnny Depp does another wonderfull job acting. As a whole, the movie holds up well. The only problem i have with judging this film is that i made the mistake of reading the short story (in Twelve Past Midnight by Stephen King). I came into the theater with preconceptions, and the film was really different than the story. Koepp changed the ending, which i was dissaponted with just because it was different, but the one he replaces it with holds up. But after the movie was over, i thought that the movie was decent, and deserves more people to watch it. It didnt do so well box-office wise back in March which suprised me. But a word to the wise, rent this movie, you will be pleased"
3,Ehhh.,"I didn't know this film existed until I stumbled upon it when in a rental store. I found it to be a weak cross between The Shining and Misery, but it kept me interested until the end. Johnny Depp's acting was very good, but the plot ""twists"" were not as thrilling as advertised."
2,Seen it all before,"The only thing this movie has going for it is Johnny Depp. Other than Depps performance there was nothing going on that I had not seen before. The whole thing wreaked of ""The Dark Half"". To further the feeling of that movie they even had Timothy Hutton in it. The trailers for this made it seem like it was going to be a roller-coaster ride full of chills, spills and screams. Well, it was none of that. There was some anxious moments that never turned in to much of anything. The ending will not surprise or shock you. The only thing shocking was that I was so excited about this and then let down so horribly. Had it not been for Johnny Depp this would have been one of the worst movies of all time. He could make toilet cleaning interesting which in itself would be scarier than this flop."
2,Secret Window,"This movie is worth renting but not buying, and even then renting it for a dollar, maybe. The movie has weak character development excePt for Depp's character. You would think that by now no one would dare do a remake of the Shinning or Fight Club,but guess again. This movie combines both, not in a good way. I have to admit the only thing that kept me from turning it off was Depp's ability to play a great character. For all of you Depp lovers, his performance is great but its like watching a Captain sink with his ship. OVERALL CRAPPY MOVIE"
2,Eh.,"I liked this movie better when it was called Identity. I mean, Fight Club. I mean, A Beautiful Mind. I mean..."
3,A Very Minor Stephen King Tale,"Were it not for the usual deft Johnny Depp performance, this movie would pass unnoticed for good reasons. The story is transparent and were it not for Depp's ability to make the most out of very little, this lame Stephen King toss-off would be almost without merit. Despite the corny plot there are some transient moments of fright and others of true, finely finessed comedy in the body language and facial expressions of Depp. The cast is otherwise mostly not seen or heard, but when they are they are adequate - Maria Bello as the wife that has nothing positive about her, Timothy Hutton, Charles Dutton, Len Cariou, and John Turturro in a flat, wasted role. Worth watching for Depp's bravura, but you'll know the ending form the beginning if you are a Stephen King fan."
4,Fantastic!,"Great movie, I also recommend the book or novella too. Read it, really good. I enjoyed it, it had a nice twist to it, suspenseful! A must see if you are a Johnny Depp fan, but of course you would have already seen it. :)"
2,"Secret Window, Secret Garden","A vivid, gory movie, based upon a short story by Stephen King called ""Secret Window, Secret Garden."" Johnny Depp plays an actor haunted by a strange southerner who claims that Depp's character has stolen his story.This is a bizarre movie with a lot of twists and unnecessary blood and violence. It is easily forgettable; many of the twists that do happen we've seen before in such films as ""The Sixth Sense,"" et. al. There seems to be no plot here, just a load of trashy moments that are meant to be suspense-filled. ""Secret Window"" capitalizes on Depp's fame to garner a lot of box-office revenue. The movie's biased view of Southerners does not do it any credit, either.With trash such as this floating around, there's no wonder that Depp fans instead turn to more lucrative films such as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" for a more enjoyable experience."
3,The dreams of the reason produce monsters!,"The writer against his own ghosts and fighting day afterday with this dragon . The hallucinations and the otherness of the human being (Van Gogh , Goya , Faulkner , Rimbaud , Shakespeare , Proust) are present in this intelligent puzzle recreated with credibility and depicted with surrealistic moods . This adaptation of Stephen King novel has only a little default . It reminds us too much to The shinning . There are very common places ; the isolated writer , the loneliness , the creativity absence , the letters on the Lap top and the pages in the typewriter , the similar resources from the outerworld to our disturbed writer . That sin makes the film became very predictable .It just to recognize the amazing role given for John Turturro (The Luzin Defense) . I missed the role played for Maria Bello to Naomi Watts , for instance .Depp is credible in this role but the script didn't help too much in this case."
2,The Shining. Light. Real light.,"Not sure why they bothered with this one. First of all, the story is so similar to The Shining,but without any of the things that made The Shining so great. King was either fresh out of ideas when he wrote this one or he was working on a tight deadline .... Anyway, Depp is great and the only reason to see this film. Bello, Hutton and Dutton have extended cameo roles that allow them to really do nothing. As the ""surprises"" are revealed they become more and more obvious and less and less interesting. Why bother is the question that comes to mind."
2,Not Impressed,"Johnny Depp did a great job with the character (s) he played. But the movie is pretty slow and boring until the crazy ending. I find it hard to believe that they rated this movie PG-13! Iv'e seen R rated movies that didn't have as much blood and swearing in them as this one! Now parents will be angry after they show their kids a movie that should have an R rating! As for the movie, somebody definatly needs some psychotherapy. Movies like this are only making society crazier! Stick with normal movies."
2,Not abysmal... but close,"This movie is somewhat entertaining, for the first hour. The viewer gets a little frightened and questions ""Who is this creepy guy who is claiming that Johnny Depp stole his story?"" But once you find out the ending, you just might want to run back to amazon.com in a rage and return the movie. Their are plenty of other movies that are much better. Do not waste your time or money on ""Secret Window"". It disappoints."
3,not predictable - but who cares?,"So the stars are all for Johnny Depp. The plot was average. If it had been some B movie actor in J Depp's role then this film would have been released straight to video.There are no big scares. Johnny Depp played his character to perfection, capturing all the little oddities of a man living alone for a while - some of that very funny. It's great that he isn't afraid to be shown as scared or weak - and it's just entertaining to watch him passout. His exwife is hardly simpathetic - though she isn't really supposed to be for the ending to work and yet you lose even that scare and that routing for her moment when her life is in danger.The ending surprised me but I was to happy with it instead of disturbed or scared.Fine to watch once.Don't bother if you aren't a Depp fan."
5,only losers talk about johnny depp,"I don't know why you all would get on here and dog johnny's performance, he has alot of things going for him and he is very hot, and very sexy. He's the very best actor i have seen in years!"
3,Suprisingly Mediocre Movie which Had Potential,"Perhaps my expectations were to high as Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors. This movie started out with a great premise and kept you interested... It seemed a bit slow at times, but you were waiting for the ""thriller moment"" -- when it came, it was so uninspired and bland that I walked out of the movie wondering why I had paid matinee price to watch this movie. The ending was terrible, the plot was slow but it had potential, and it just could have been so much more than it was. I recommend this as rental when its no longer a new release, or watch it on TV."
5,Best Movie I Seen in Awhile,This is a good movie. You will love the move plus it is PG-13. At first you won't understand it but you can get it. I can't wait to this movie come on DVD I will be the first to buy it. I am even going to read the book. If the book is as good as as the movie I will read the whole book in 2 days.
3,It seemed very familiar,"As I sat in the movie theatre, I kept thinking that this all seemes very familiar and wondered why I kept thinking about the butler from the movie Mr. Deeds. I do agree with other reviewers that this is a very excellent performance by Johnny Depp, but the story line lacked and kept me bored for the first hour and then after the movie was over I compaired it to Fight Club which seemed very similar to this story line. I would not have been afraid to get up to go to the bathroom or get something to eat because I would miss part of the story line. Even though I harp on this, I still found this a decent movie with excellent cast."
4,Another King Film,"Just seeing the preview got me hooked on this film. I can't wait until it comes out. I've read the short story: Secret Window, Secret Garden and I must say I was impressed. I haven't seen it yet, but the film appears to follow the story of a writer who's just survived a nasty divorce only to find himself accused of plagarism and fighting for his life against a stranger calling himself John Shooter. That's how it is in the book. Hopefully they'll keep the shock ending intact, because it seems to be that no matter how hard they try, King films always fall apart near the end. Maybe this film will finally break the screen and clear King's name from failure to blinding success."
5,Insane People Shouldn't Write Reviews!!/Let Me,Okay that other guy who reviewed this is insane as H.This movie is awesome. Johnny Depp gives a brilliant performance as author Mort Rainey. If you read the book then you know the story and hopefully you also know that movies won't ever be completely the same as the book. So don't be mad at the movie just get used to it.
5,This film deserves 5 stars,"I watch movies all the time. I've been watching and studying them for years. People these days just can't seem to make good films like the good old days. But this is a good film. One of the best new movies I've seen in a long time. It kept me on the edge of my seat and the ending was great. But the whole movie was great. There probably wouldn't be a Secret Window if it wasn't for Johnny Depp. He is the perfect guy for this film and I can't imagine any other actor taking his role. Overall, this was a good, entertaining film and was very thrilling and suspensful. If you want to go out and see a good movie, go and see this."
4,good movie overall,Johnny Depp turns out a pretty good performance in this movie. The best thing about Secret Window is the slow build-up. Throughout the movie you are sitting there anxiously waiting what will happen next. The movie works really well. Johnny Depp continues to amaze us with his talented ability to perform in a variety of different movies and plotlines. Turns out he can do suspense too.
3,See it for Johnny Depp,"Johnny Depp proves he's a movie star once again with his turn as an eccentric, recently separated horror writer living in isolation in a cabin far from town. Seeking inspiration for his next story, his world is turned upside down when a creepy man repeatedly accuses him of plagarizing his story.While Secret Window never reaches any levels of actual fright that its trailer promises, the film has a dark tone that Depp is accustomed to. His performance delivers and is the only convincing reason to see this movie. John Turturro and Maria Bello offer solid supporting performances, but all in all, its the story that falls flat. If only screenwriters spent a little more time crafting the story instead of rushing to produce a film."
3,It has its moments . . .,"Had to see SECRET WINDOW just to see what Johnny Depp would do with what was bound to be a predictable plot, and I wasn't disappointed in his turn as a Stephen King character. Depp delivers with his trademark attractive quirkiness, but, you know, I really didn't quite believe him as his character evolved. John Turturro's John Shooter from Mississippi was too obvious a caricature (offensive, really), thus robbing the plot of credence---and I have to say that the other characters were likable but seemed remarkably dim and/or overplayed. Thus, I don't think the film works very well, despite being beautifully shot, but it does evoke dread here and there. Definitely worth seeing, but don't get your hopes up."
3,"3.5 Stars: Decent, Predictable: 'Fight Club meets Monster'","Johnny Depp is always enjoyable in movies, but this movie was totally predictable after about 10-15 minutes. I've dubbed this movie ""Fight Club"" Meets ""Monster"". It was a decent DVD rental for a Monday night, but not much more, although I purchased this DVD as a per-order, as I always do. Its worth your time, but don't expect to be blown away... Anybody who has seen Fight Club will likely figure this movie out within the first 10 minutes, after which the movie loses most of its appeal."
3,predictible,My wife and I both guessed where this plot was going. She gave up. I watched it to the end to see if we were correct.Shooter could have been cast better or had a better accent. He was annoying to hear.
3,Not the best,"This movie gave me nightmares. Not that this is necessarily a problem! I'm all for a great suspense thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat and gives you a couple of really good scares, which this did... however there was more out-and-out pointless violence than I wanted to see. I'm a HUGE fan of the whole M. Night Shyamalan subtle thriller... movies of that class don't need to show much to scare the pants off you, but this one was not up to that par... it relied too much on graphic violence and gore. I was going to give it two stars, but the corn scene in the end won it an extra one... if nothing else it was really entertaining!"
3,Not bad for a Depp film,"If you've ever read any of my other reviews, you know that I love Johnny Depp. I've seen most of his work and he does not fail to deliver in this movie. He's cute as a button and slings off one liners that are signature Depp. However, the person I was watching the film with and I figured out the plot not even halfway through the movie. I wouldn't have called it ""gory"" as one reviewer did. I actually hid my eyes more in ""Stir of Echoes"" then in this film. It did keep my attention, but only because the actors did a spledid job with the material they were given. I would recommend this movie for any Depp fan because you do get a classic, quirky character. It's no Jack Sparrow, but it's obvious that Depp tried. If you want a scary movie that keeps you guessing, go with the first movie from the director: ""Stir of Echoes""."
1,A waste of directing and acting talent,"This movie has the same lousy plot of another King movie/story, The Night Flyer (1998). The director and actors did the best they could, but ultimately the story just collapses. Avoid."
1,Great movie but .....,This is a great movie but it does not include either spanish audio or spanish subtitles. It stinks.
3,entertainingly bleak,"I enjoyed this film mainly for its pure entertainment value and it's unapologetically bleak ending which was a bit refreshing to me. Depp, as always, gives a stellar performance and the supporting actors are also top notch although they're never really given a chance to shine. Depp is the star here. Secret Window is a bit predictable (I wasn't surprised one bit by the ""twist"" ending), a bit unbelievable (call the police, move out, kill the guy, whatever and wouldn't most writers have copies of their published works on hand?) and typically Stephen King: high on suspense, low on substance. It's a good friday or saturday I-have-nothing-better-to-do-wrapped-up-in-a-blanket-with-the-lights-out-eating-popcorn kind of scary movie. Take it for that because, like most Hollywood horror suspense films, that's all you're going to get. Fun but a bit predictable."
2,not quite it!,"This was a disappointment to me. It was like a half squeezed orange. The whole film could have been a little more sinister and a little more frightening. Even John Turturro, who usually turns in a stellar performance in whatever he does, did not have a real presence in this film. I bet he did all of his scenes in one day and them left. I got the impression that Johny Depp did this one to pay the rent. They could have done a better job."
4,WORTH A LOOK,"""Secret Window"" is better than the trailer you saw on TV indicates. Don't want to give away too much of the plot, but there are some surprises in this movie that actually keep you on the edge of your seat, should have been R instead of PG-13. Johnny Depp's performance is much like ""Sleepy Hollow"", a reasonably intelligent individual with a little neuroticism mixed in. John Turturro, outstanding as usual, this guy deserves more leading roles, he rates an Oscar on his shelf someday. Perfect example of a Rental movie, you enjoy it, but don't want to keep it. Give it a look, Recommended."
4,Soon her death will be a mystery even to me...,"Secret Window is based on the book, ""Secret window, secret garden"" by Stephen King. It tells the story of a writer named Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), who is suddenly visited by the mysterious stranger John Shooter (John Turturro) Mort is accused of plagerizing one of his stories and is threatened by Shooter to pay the consequences if he doesn't change the ending. You'll have to find out for yourself what goes on from there...It is true, that for some of the people who watch this movie, it will be quite predictable, which is really the only downpoint to it. Even if this movie does seem predictable, it is still good. However, I would not have given this film as high of a rating if it wern't for Johnny Depp. He proves to be the great actor that he is, through this movie and makes it something worth seeing."
4,I liked it,"Secret Window is another one of those movies that I thought was going to bore me. But, I was once again surprised to find that I actually liked this movie. It isn't fast-paced at first, but it does pick up, and the moments where it isn't fast-paced are good anyway. The story is very good in my opinion, and the acting and characters were superb. I'm a tad iffy on the ending though, I'm not sure if I like it or not. But overall it's a good movie. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
5,Clarity!,"Where other science writers leave many ideas murkyand impenetrable, Morris has a knack for makingeverything clear. As the review excerpt on oneof his previous books said, he can explain StephenHawking better than Hawking does. In this book, heexplains the concept of infinity, beginning withZeno's paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise, andconcluding with black holes and the possibility ofan infinite number of universe. When I looked atthe table ot contents, I thought, ""I'll never beable to understand all this."" But I did."
1,¿Verano-Invierno?,"Estoy iniciando la lectura del libro, por lo que no puedo todavía emitir una opinión global. Pero he hallado una afirmación tan errónea, que no puedo evitar comentarla. En la página 52 de la edición en español (Ediciones B, ISBN: 84-406-9582-9)dice que el Sol, ""más próximo a la Tierra en verano que en invierno""... ¿Cómo?¿Desde cuándo las estaciones se relacionan con la proximidad al Sol? Como que dudo de que el Sr. Morris, todo un doctor en Física, según los créditos del libro, cometa un error tan flagrante, pienso que quizá se trate de un error de traducción. ¿O es que estoy equivocado y el Sol sí está más proximo a la Tierra en verano que en invierno?"
1,Betrays Sparta,Don't get this game! At least download the torrent version and try it first! I was expecting something more realistic which would match the style of EA LOTR series. The graphics are acceptable but the theme and concept are not with today's standards. It plays and looks like a comic book. The realism of games like World in Conflict and the Total War series are leagues ahead of this game.
2,Not for those interested in an introduction to MLK,"Though this book won the Pulitzer, I was disappointed. I even special ordered it, but found it plodding and incredibly bogged down with detail. For the MLK scholar, it must be old hat. For the rest of us,,,,simply too much."
2,A Shame,"I, as well as another reviewer, am a loyal Sister Hazel fan. I have followed them for over six years and have attended numerous concerts along the way. I absolutely loved ""Chasing Daylight"" as well as all their other albums and could not wait for ""Lift"". I am afraid to say it wasn't worth the wait. One of the reasons I have always loved Sister Hazel is for their unique sound. For this album, ""Lift"", it seems they abandoned the classic sound and entered a time warp back to the seventies (if they even made it there). I love the guys and I really wish I could write an enthusiastic review about how great this album was and that they put their others to shame. However, all I can say is--what a shame!"
4,I was turned onto,"This group a few years ago and just love them. I love the sense of humor that comes out in their music as well as the love ballads. If you like Sister Hazel, you'll like this cd as much as the others."
4,Sister Hazel never disappoints.....,"It's great to see SH come up with new music, new sounds and still come out with a great CD. The vocals are awesome and the ""soul"" behind their music is very clear in Lift, just listen to the lyrics! You don't just play Sister Hazel in your cd player, you feel them, you take the time to enjoy what you are hearing.....it's a great addition to anyone's SH collection."
3,little disappointed,"....I guess I was expecting more after ""THE HAZEL"" delivered the amazing ""Chasing Daylight"". Other than the song ""Green"" I can't find any songs that really grab my attention. Not a bad album, but for them this is easily their weakest effort. Do yourself a favor and pick up ""Live-Live"" and ""Chasing Daylight""!!"
4,Lift - Yeehaw!!,"With the latest release, Lift, Sister Hazel has once again done what many bands today cannot seem to do.....duplicate great music over and over again. This album is like a homecooked meal - comforting, familiar, and filling.Like albums released in the past, it can appeal to many different people. Harmonies are as always, right on target and can make you feel as if anyone can sing right along. Great new tracks and a powerful remake of the Cars ""Just What I Needed"".Well worth purchasing."
2,Unpleasantly Surprised!,"I was rather hesitant to try this software out, I had bought magix mp3 maker 4 years ago and was very disappointed. At this point though I was rather willing to give magix a try again. Well so much for that thought, this software locked up everytime I tried to used it. The music player couldn't even play my mp3s. Well just a word of warning, explore other alternatives before going with this software."
4,"What a long, strange trip it has been...","As a professional educator in a community college setting, I've been trying for months to get a copy of this tape to call my very own. It's an extensive, and well done look at the 'science' of human behavior, namely psychology, in the United States since the turn of the century. From Freud to eugenics, from behaviorism to the 'medical miracles' for schizophrenia in a pill, to playing genetic detective in Columbia, this video takes anyone, student or just interested viewer alike, on a fascinating historical journey. I watched the faces of my students as they were captivated by the sights, sounds,and historical contexts that were presented. Delight, horror, thoughtfulness, intrigue,all there in reaction. Worth the 2 hours of class time, many times over."
2,Not so sure,"I am a teacher and I ordered this product for a student with fine motor weakness. It seems extremely difficult to knead and pull apart, but perhaps I am using it incorrectly? I ordered the soft and the medium soft and they are both pretty tough. I would want to do more research before buying this product again."
4,Superb!,"The novelization of ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" is just as exciting as the movie--or I should say better! It picks up where the first movie leaves off. I found the book an exciting read due to its World War II cat-and-mouse submarine warfare feeling in the space battles. Vonda McIntyre has done a fine job at writing the novel, while adding more flavor to the characters. She makes references to the Original Series episode, ""Space Seed"" and what happened to Lt. Marla McIver after she betrayed the Enterprise crew, and her life on Ceti Alpha V in exile with Khan. Khan's characterin the novel is remarkable, like a 23rd century Ahab."
1,not comfortable,"I was very disappointed upon receiving these sneaks. I am a true Asics fan and only buy Asic sneakers. This particular model is more narrow than any other. They are also not as deep, so I am unable to put my instep inserts into the shoe and still be comfortable. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone who enjoys how Asics feel, as these are not representative of any other model i have tried (KAyano's, 1110's, 2110's, 2120'3. 2130's)."
1,Terrible,Bulbs were broke when received. No packing material used to protect shipment. No invoice or correspondence included to contact shipper. Sent a reply email to shipper after being contacted about purchase. Explained receipt of broken merchandise but never contacted for refund or new shipment.
1,This sucks!,This bulb does not fit the fixture. The bulb that is pictured on the website is not the same one I received. Lightbulbsdirect.com told me that Westek no longer makes the bulb for my fixture even though it is still pictured on their website.
5,Very pleased with this product,It seems to clear cough quite fast for me and my teenage daughters. A very good item to have at home for sudden cold attacks.
1,Stanislaski Brothers,"I can't review the item because I never received it, even after trying to be in touch with someone 3 times and being promised it was sent twice!"
4,Two fabulous romance stories - one great family,"The Stanislaski Brothers is a book of 2 complete stories; one about Mikhail Stanislaski (Luring a Lady) and the other about Alexi Stanislaski (Convincing Alex). I have to admit I liked Mikhail a little better than Alexi. Something about his story held me more and I felt it more compelling, a little more romantic. That is not to say that I did not enjoy Alexi as well, his is a great story.Both are great romance stories, every woman's fantasy! Mikhail and Alexi are both fabulous leading men, very different people but each sensitive, caring and loving in their own way. I really like it when Nora Roberts writes about families you can feel as if you are a part of them and get to know everyone - I just love this family, wish I could have met them! I can't wait to read The Stanislaski Sisters!"
4,The Stanislaski Clan - What an interesting family,"Nora creates another wonderful family, and you just can't wait to read their stories. The boys are hot headed, gorgeous, and close to their family. Their mates are compassionate, bright, classy, and attractive, but don't have family relationships. Contrary to most older Silhoutte romances, the girls are not virgins when they meet the guys which makes the stories so much more believable. Although the books are reprints, they stand the test of time. I really liked both Mik's and Alexi's stories They contain lots of humour and lots of romance and are fun to read. Mik and Sydney's story takes place a few years before that of Alexi and Bess, so you get to peek at the relationships over a few years as the family grows. Can't wait to read Rachel's and Natasha's stories. Enjoy!"
4,ANOTHER FUN READ FROM NORA!,"I'm glad to see Ms. Robert's older books being re-released. The ""Stanislasky"" series is a good example of well written, fun, romance genre at its very best. As in all her books, the characters are well drawn, the story lines credible and interesting, and her dialogue fun and often surprising. How she manages to make her ""formula"" work over and over again is her genious. For exhausted women everywhere who want a little harmless excitment in their lives, we tip our mascara wands in salute to Nora Roberts."
1,Loss of Time,"This book contained two stories, actually identical. Two brothers meet two girls in their own story which is a carbon copy of nothing. Trash! I can't believe I wasted my time. No more books by this author for me......Too bad, I used to like her writing."
4,M.I.K.E. Remix is excellent,"Vengaboys are back with a 3rd single from their nagging Platinum Album. With every release, they've managed to spirial downwards - the quality is severely diminishing from songs like ""Up & Down"", ""We Like To Party"", ""Better World"" and ""Overwhelm Yourself"".You're probably wondering why I gave this 4 stars... this is strictly because of the ""M.I.K.E. Remix"". M.I.K.E. is the guy behind Push that brought the trance world ""Universal Nation"" and more recently ""Till We Meet Again"". This remix alone deserves 5 stars, but the original has brought it down to 4.This mix starts off similar to the Sanctuary mix of Delerium's ""Silence"", and progresses somewhat into a progressive trance tune. The only thing that remains from the original is the vocals ""I can't take it no more.."" which is actually a nice touch. A great remix for a bad tune. The other remix is provided by Lock 'N Load - though I haven't heard it and thus won't judge it."
2,"Looks great, package for shipping horrible","The product itself is great and from a distance looks like a real flame. Perfect for the use I was purchasing it for. Unfortunately the packaging for the product was insufficient and the product came broken. The plastic body split in half. I actually sent it back and ordered another one. Unfortunately that one came broken as well. One of the lights had broken off. I was still able to use it for the one time event since I didn't have time to order a 3rd one, but overall I was bummed because when plugged in it really does look like a real flame. I think purchasing it from a local party store would be a better bet, since the company packaging may not be aware of their packing issues."
3,OK,I received the wrong item but kept it due to the correct item not being available. Item was fine but not exactly what I wanted. It wasn't worth the hassle of sending it back since the other product wasn't available. I probably will not order from that company again.
2,I'm upset about this,"I got this lamp for my grandson at Christmas time and there's no off/on switch on the cord, like one that I own. It's dangerous for a child to unplug a lamp over & over. There's hardly any material on top to resemble a flame (it's so cheap they could have put much more) I had to 'add' more to make it look like fire! And the fan that propells the 'flame' was blowing one side well but not the other. Spend more and order a better one. I gave him mine."
1,broken,"the one light bulb was broken off the connecter, the other light bulb worked a little but i had to tape it to a prong because the shaft it goes in was broken and the connection wasnt good so the light would go out...the fan worked"
1,Table Top Flame Lamp,"I ordered 4 of these and all 4 arrived broken. I will never order these again! I purchased my first one from Spencer's years ago and it's still working. This one is a cheap, cheap version of the one from Spencer's.I was very disappointed in this product."
5,stunning,"I have all of Hillary Stagg's cd's, and purchased many of them to give away as Christmas gifts. This music transports you to mystical, magical, enchanted universes and beyond. I can literally feel my body and mind relax when I listen to any of his cd's - great for meditation! Wonderful music to take to the beach and look at the stars. Amazing, magical, medicating music....."
5,Fantastic - Staggs best CD so far!!,"I bought ""Sweet Return"" because I like Hillary Stagg's music. He and Peter Sterling are fantastic harpists. When I heard cut #4 - I felt like I was returning to a location I had not visited during this lifetime...very mystical and beautiful."
2,"Awesome bluetooth sound quality, but very very poorly designed","I received these headphones as a present, two weeks after getting them, while the bluetooth works great (however you cannot use the mic with a computer) but the headphones broke. The band between the two speakers is tiny and breaks very easily. I was able to return them and get a new pair. Then two weeks later, they broke in the same exact location. So here, i am with two bluetooth speakers connected by a wire, and wondering, ""Can i put them into other headphones?"" These are very very very poorly designed.-a little bitter."
4,One caveat...,"The Nylons are spectacular singers - fun and inventive, but this collection is missing my all-time favorite Nylons song: ""This Island Earth"". It's one of the most touching and inspiring environmental message songs ever, and it's on the CD ""Happy Together""."
1,Worthless,"I bought this book after enjoying the excellent Guide to Texas and the Middle South from the same series. Unfortunately, the guides are all by different authors, and vary widely in the quality of their content. I've bought four of them so far, and this one is the worst of the bunch.The Texas book is a ""Blue Highways"" (i.e., off the beaten track) guide, and contains descriptions of fascinating places that you're not likely to find anywhere else. This one, on the other hand, is no better than those free tourist guides that you find on racks in pancake houses and cheap hotels.Mr. Dunn is both unimaginative and lazy, and this book suffers from it. The National Geographic generally does much better. They should own up to their mistake and pull this turkey off the market."
2,Not so hot,"I was very disappointed with this CD. I'm unfamiliar with Kevin Kern's other works, so I'm not sure how this fares with his other albums, but I found ""In the Enchanted Garden"" to be pretty uninteresting. It sounded altogether contrived. The word ""cheesy"" comes to mind, and not just because I live in Wisconsin."
2,Unremarkable,"This album may have the most beautiful cover in the history of records,but the music is pure bloodless and entirely forgettable.There is absolutely nothing on the entire disc that is memorable in any way.I wanted to like these soft and romantic piano works but there is nothing that bears repeated listening.I suggest Bach,Chopin or debussy if you want some real keyboard masterpieces.By the way i gave away the cd but kept the pretty album cover!"
2,Unremarkable,"This album may have the most beautiful cover in the history of records,but the music is pure bloodless and entirely forgettable.There is absolutely nothing on the entire disc that is memorable in any way.I wanted to like these soft and romantic piano works but there is nothing that bears repeated listening.I suggest Bach,Chopin,Haydn or Debussy if you want some real keyboard masterpieces.By the way i gave away the cd but kept the pretty album cover!"
5,Peaceful Sleeps and Soothing Monings,"I had first heard Kern's ""In the Enchanted Garden"" as warm up/strech music for an early morning dance class I had taken. It was beautiful and relaxing, being it the first thing I hear in the mornings as we'd loosen up our still tight bed stiff joints. My particular favroites on the CD are the first three, ""Through the Arbor"", ""Sundial Dreams"" and ""The Enchanted Garden"". At the end of the day I have this waiting in my CD player to listen to it all over again. It is the perfect bedtime music to ease you into ""Sundial Dreams"" of your own."
5,CALMS THE SOUL!,"This is a very relaxing and peaceful CD with every track emotionally soothing. Kevin Kern's brilliant music is beautifully orchastrated with a perfect blend of accompaniment. This is the ideal music for ""de-stressing"". It's a shame timothy1146 is obviously wrapped up in his outer self and is not allowing this serene music to touch his soul. Oh what he is missing! THIS IS A MUST CD for your music collection. I am only sorry I did not discover this unforgettable CD sooner."
3,nice single but missing something,"""All I Want"" is a nice single from La Bouche but is missing something, or should I say someone important: Melanie Thornton! This song just isnt the same without her and would have been better if she was singing it instead of some cheap phony. Nevertheless, it's still pretty good, though it's not gonna blow you away since you won't be hearing Melanie on here."
2,2nd time out sucks!!!,"I remember buying this on cassette tape back in the mid 80's, after enjoying Rockwell's first effort ""Somebody Watching me""..the album cover was the first mistake,it was the mid 80's so some set director for the album cover photo shoot decided to dress him(Rockwell)up like Andre Cymone or Prince..wrong idea,the songs are lackluster and almost try to duplicate the sound of the debut album,although Rockwell was in reality Berry Gordy's son that Motown machine broke down on this one."
4,"Unrestrained, Vulgar, and Artful","Apollinaire delivers some of the most explicit erotica ever committed to the printed page, managing to do so with wit and a refreshing matter-of-fact bluntness that never degenerates into a mere exhibition of so-called perversion. This is not for the squeamish, or those easily put off by marginal sexual practices. These two works act as a fantastic clean sweep of the residual psychological Victorianism that still permeates our society, even after the sexual revolution. Like Bataille's ""Story of the Eye"" without that author's harrowing social vivisections, this book has caused more than one ostensibly jaded friend to recoil in disgust. That Apollinaire manages this with style is a testament to his twisted genius."
1,Don't Wait for it and Don't waste your money if you do,"Let's be honest here and say that Abishek Bachchan and Priyanka Chopra are two of the lousiest actors to have come out of Bollywood. I rented this film from an Indian video store and I am sorry I wasted $3.00 on it. I wish I could get my money back. Please save your money and look elsewhere. Not only is the dialogue stupid, but the scenes are choppy, the actors CAN'T act and the story makes absolutely no bloody sense. It starts out in modern day somewhere in Europe and ends up somewhere in la la land. The director, Goldie Behl needs to find another hobby."
1,Extremely Noisy!!!,This worked fine in our bird bath for a couple weeks. But now it is so loud that it scares the birds. I can actually hear it inside the house. There's more than enough water in the fountain and there's nothing stuck in the unit. I'm very disappointed. What a waste of money.
3,"first pump, lowered rating because of page product description",i got a little confused but to sum it up this pump can supposedly lift water 2.5 ft high through the tube and it will supposedly shoot water out of the tube up to one foot high... also did not come with two AA batteries like the page said although i dont know whay it would...
2,Works but extremely loud,"Pump works fine, but fresh out of the box the noise on this unit is crazy tried taking it apart and checking the impeller and other parts for blockages or anything out of the ordinary. All looks clear Do not see why this unit is making so much noise. Have since put this unit to the side using a mini-jet instead."
5,Light and inspirational,"I love this book, like all other chicken soup books! They are light to read, especially needed when you have really hard days!"
5,keeps getting better!,"Again, another wonderful, tear-jerking, humorous, sweet book filled with true stories about motherhood. You can't go wrong with any Chicken Soup book. I hope there will be many more to come!"
1,good fiction,book of fiction 90% hype for himself most of what he said happened 2 others not himself he taking credit for others action
5,A Chunk of Gold,"Although there are only a few songs on this album, I find myself picking this one a lot when I am in the mood for Will Oldham music. Great interpretations of these songs; the price might be prohibitive but I think at $20 probably worth it.Note: What's amazing is that with only three reviews prior to this one, ALL THREE contain false information. This IS a re-release (of Travels in Constants Volume 7--see http://www.temporaryresidence.com/descriptions/travels.php), but NOT on Lost Blues 2! This re-release, also out of print, is a studio version with a few extra instruments not on the original (piano, for example) and the audience noise cleaned up."
2,Bigger sound may not please,"I rarely listen to this album. When I first heard it I was shocked by the bigger, louder sound that a few of the songs have. Usually the poor production quality of his albums is charming and leads to a forlorn atmosphere, but on songs with louder instruments and vocals the low quality makes it sound like a demo tape at times rather than a rustic recording. If you're just starting to fill out your Will Oldham collection then I suggest you pick something else. It does grow on you, but it's not canonical, classic Oldham."
5,Spiritual Authority,Very thought provoking. I'm in the process of studying this book along with the scripture references
3,Speed of Balance,"I bought the cd for meditating, but some songs are fast pace and not very relaxing."
4,good,"we bought this cd and it is very good .this cd focus in speed of balance which it's made for tranquilizing your heart.so you'll ve geting rid of the estress very easy joust whit hearing to it were ever you are runing,in the car,in the office it dosen't matter."
3,Warrior's Travelog,"Heinrich Vossler, a young Wurttemberg cavalry officer, has left a gripping tale of Napoleon's campaigns of 1812 and 1813 as well as an account of life as an allied POW. His description of the Russian catastrophe is particularly noteworthy - a true reminder of the horrors of war. Vossler also took time to observe the countryside through which he traveled and their inhabitants (good & bad), leaving behind some wry comments. Recommended for students of the Russian campaign and for those researching Napoleon's German contingents. My copy is from the Folio Society, grimly adorned with lithographs by Faber du Faur."
5,A marvelous exploration of self states and their regulation.,"Sheldon Bach has written a teriffic book not only about perversion, but also about the development of self states and their regulation. While all of us have the capacity to have masochistic and sadistic elements in out intimate relationships, not all of us become frozen in those dynamics. In his eloquent work, Mr. Bach simply states,""The pain of suffering defends against the greater pain of loss.""(p17) It is at this point that we start to see how failed attempts at relating and separating from the primary caregiver lead to part object relationships(fetishes),difficulties with boundries and problems in self regulation. The book gets extra merit for Mr. Bach's ability to bring the theory into the room and into the relationship between patient and analyst. Whether you are a therapist or a patient, this is a must read."
2,Narrow Tip = Achy Feet,The front of the shoe is narrow. I don't have exceptionally wide feet but after a few hours in these shoes my feet hurt. A shame because I own 4 other pairs of Tsubo shoes and they've been extremely comfortable.
2,Connection problems,"After using this a few times, it has been very difficult to connect the hose to the root feeder. The hose will shoot out of the feeder and I believe this is causing the feeder to get stripped. I think it should connect better."
3,good product; BUT!,I've had ross feeders before so I was disappointed that this feeder would not allow me to adjust the flow of water precisely. The water is either full-on or just barely flowing. I use it mainly to water plants so I can adapt I guess.
1,Cheap - don't buy,"I purchased this after my old one of about 20 years gave out this spring. I was able to use the new one once on two new small trees. With the current lack of rain in our area, I wanted to give them both a second deep watering. I was able to start the watering using the feeder on the smaller of my two trees and was ready to do the second side (I water twice on each tree, once on each side) and pulled the feeder out. As I moved it to the second side, away from the water source, the hose connection snapped. As this is a major source of strain on the device, I was very surprised that this was so poorly constructed. I will not buy another of this design and material. I would like to be able to use my remaining supply of plant food that I have for the feeder, but so far have not been able to find another that will take any sort of feeding material in addition to watering."
2,Disappointing,"Anyone who still has, or remembers the original Ross Root Feeder, will be shocked by this item (and also the ""professional"" version).It is cheaply made (plastic with a weak metal rod) and must be used with care. With those caveats, it does the job. I hope it will last the season. However long it lasts, I will not buy another of these -- unless they go back to the original product -- which was ""professional"" grade as there was only one grade! No rip-offs.If they want to make these new types, the price should be MUCh lower."
1,Ross 10233 102 Tree and Shrub Root Feeder,"I had my old Ross root feeder and after so many years it rusted out.I order this new one......was a waste, it takes forever to deep irrigate trees or bushes.... finally I got and old one from a garage sale...I use Ross fertilizers quite a lot ( good product ) but not the new feeders."
2,This is not the picture of the product you are getting!!!,"I bought this product for my 5 year old boy and 2 nephews, and what I got was another product, not the one in the picture.Before you buy this product, please read the details from the manufacturer, and look at the pictures at:http://www.oral-b.com/products/product.asp?tid=products⊂=power&cid;=power&pid;=kidsbatteryThe picture shown is that of the power toothbrush with EZ-timer and RECHARGEABLE batteries (you can see the charger in one of the pictures when you click on ""See more pictures and other information"").Read the details for the item in the picture at:http://www.oral-b.com/products/product.asp?tid=products⊂=power&cid;=power&pid;=kidspower*** But remember! The product you will get if you purchase this item is not the one in the picture! I already told Amazon Customer Service of this error 3 months ago, but they haven't changed it yet... I still LOVE AMAZON!"
2,"pricey but good,",Way too expensive $14.99 + $4.49 minium shipping. GooseIsland is available @ Target for $4.49/six pack. A far better natural soda is Boylan @ $3.49/4 pack available at Publix/ Albertsons and Safway
2,"Most good, this one..not so good","I own countless Ministry of Sound compilations, and for the most part have been pretty good.The quality of some of the dubs have been degrading, and blending in noise that just shouldn't be there.Overall MOS albums rock, and are the best way to get every flavor your looking for.This one in my opinion, needs to be off the books... There were only about 4 songs off of 2 CD's that were really mainstream and upbeat. The rest were strange almost alternative songs that had me constantly fast forwarding through.If your looking for a high energy feel good album, skip this one."
3,Nice shows,"I was disappointed to find that it is just the same shows as you can get in the full collection. I had bought this, the princess tales and the full collection thinking it was three different collections of different shows. Now I have two sets that show the same shows as the first I bought them and I have to figure out what to do with it. Perhaps I can find someone with little girls that will enjoy these shows as much as mine has. They really are good shows."
2,2 days old and broken already!,I bought 2 boohbahs this Christmas. One for each of my children. My 4 year old son picked up his blue boohbah by the head and carried him around like that for probably less than a minute. When he put it down it didn't work at all. I probably would have picked the toy up the same way myself eventually to put it away.For a toy to break this easily this thing has to be either defective or just a flimsy product. I will be returning this toy ASAP.If you buy one or already own one beware of this problem otherwise you could end up with a broken toy too.
4,Not as good...,"I didn't find Mr. Kern's ""Beyond the Sundial"" as melodic or pleasing to the ear as his other albums, ""In The Enchanted Garden"" and ""Summer Daydreams"". Too bad - ""Pan's Return"" and ""Through The Arbor"" are surely among the best of his works!"
4,Good import.,"My favorite thing about this import is the video, and it has the full screen option. I give it four stars because I was disappointed that they didn't include an instrumental version, but all in all, it's a good enhanced CD."
3,Macmillan Teach Yourself Latin in 24 hours,"Macmillan Teach Yourself Latin in 24 hours, alone, is not a good choice for the first time Latin student. For example, it introduces all five declensions in the first chapter. This in turn becomes extremely confusing considering the book never clearly states for what purpose these declensions are used. It is explained later in great detail, but it is hard to make sense of anything in the beginning. However, it is a wonderful book to have along side another, more beginner based book. The book explains everything needed to learn and master Latin assuming you have some backround on the subject. I suggest this book with Latin Made Simple by Rhonda Hendricks. Latin Made Simple gives you the necessary backround needed to understand Macmillan Teach Yourself Latin in 24 hours."
1,One of the worse Latin texts,"This is one of the worst Latin texts I've ever read.It is totally confusing, disorganized, gives readingswhich are way above the level of the student and doesn'teven include a glossary. There are far better books onthe market."
1,Broke after 2 months of use,"I registered for this for my baby shower and although it's really cute and helpful as a new mom, it stopped working after I owned it for 2 months. I wasn't even using it every day because my son got only sponge baths at the beginning and then after that I only bathed him about three times a week. Ever since it broke, I have just been using my wrist as a tester."
3,Very useful. Died within a year,We used this digital temp tester early on with my daughter. The temperature gage worked great up until the year mark. Right around then you were no longer able to see the screen.
1,Cheap,We bought this for our second son. It lasted about 1 week before the display froze. Summer was good and mailed us a replacement. The replacement lasted about 3 weeks... Now it no longer works. I would recommend something that would last longer.
1,no way to replace batteries,this lasted us about 2-3 months of use beforethe batteries died. cannot believe you can'tchange them. terrible design and wasteful.
2,Cute but irreplaceable batteries!,Works great but am dissapointed that the batteries are irreplaceable. It was nice as a gift but would never buy it for myself knowing this. I'll stick with the rubber duck that changes colors from temperature and doesn't need batteries.
2,Only lasted about 6 weeks,"We began using this daily when our son was able to take tub baths. It's accuracy is very limited--only measuring in 2 degree increments and also it never goes over 99 degrees regardless of the actual temp. After about 6 weeks of use (for about 10-15 minutes a day) the thermometer went dead.Update: I bought another one, just because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and sure enough within 5 weeks, the turtle was dead. I did notice both times that just preceding the malfunction, the inside of the display had condensation. So, I'm thinking there was a circuit failure due to moisture. One would think a BATH thermometer would be waterproof."
2,Great toy - bad thermometer,"This worked great for the first few weeks we had it. My daughter loved to play with it and it read the water temp pretty quickly. Then the clear glass/plastic window that showed the temp got water inside so when it was warm, condensation built up inside it making it impossible to read the temperature. I had to let it air dry at least a day to be able to read it again - but it would fog up all over again anyway. But at least the green/red light worked.Then a few days later, the battery would go on and off - probably because water got inside. Sometimes it wouldn't turn on at all, sometimes it would turn on (if I banged it on the counter a few times) but then turn off shortly after.This was useful, when it worked for a few weeks. But it's better as a bath toy (an expensive one at that)."
2,Be nice if the batteries lasted longer,The thermometer works great but the battery life on this is very short and of course it's a non-replacable battery. The batteries last for about a month and a half before they start not displaying the correct temperature and dying. Seems like alot of money to spend on a thermometer with such a short life.
1,Can't replace battery & not waterproof!,"Was great until it got water logged & the battery died and the battery couldn't be replaced. Why make a bath toy/tool not waterproof? And why sell a ""SAFETY"" product you can't replace the battery on (yes it would make the company more money, but would buy this again after finding that out?) What a waste!"
1,Not a good idea.,I bought this before my boy was born. We used it for three months daily. It developed condensation inside it and quit working. I really liked it until that happened.
1,Do not buy!,"I bought this item as a gift and when it arrived the battery was dead. Apparently the customer service at the company was unwilling to work with the friend I purchased this for, so now she has a $10 bath toy. Who makes a baby product with irreplaceable batteries?? I gave it one star because I had to in order to post the review, not because the product earned it."
1,Utterly useless- buy only if you want a plastic turtle,"Worked for a couple of weeks then, as per numerous other reviews, the battery ran out. Unless you read the small print on the package, you would not know it is ""non user servicable"". It's a disgrace that a company can make such a product. Don't buy."
1,Cute but broke after 3 months,"The battery died, and it appears you can't change it. Also, it looks like water leaked into the part where it displays the temperature. It was cute and fun for the baby while it lasted, but now we need to find something else that works."
1,Broke after 3 uses...,It seemed like such a great concept- and then after the 3rd use it got water in the digital read out and no longer worked!Since it is supposed to be waterproof we are not happy.
1,"Cute, but useless","Mine didn't work from day 1! But we kept it anyway, my son still likes to play with it. it makes a cute bath toy, but nothing else."
1,"Battery dead after 8 weeks, irreplaceable","It is a nice thermometer and worked fine, but given the battery is not replaceable, it's not worth to buy it.Ours lasted about 8 weeks. Additionally, the glass window started to steam up after 6 weeks. (may be that was the root cause, but anyways, a bath thermometer should be sealed properly.)"
2,Works great as long as the batteries do.,"We used this almost daily for over 2 years. It is easy to read and use and my son has loved it as a bath toy also. It is durable and well constructed, but the batteries cannot be replaced. The first sign if the batteries going dead is the green light will cease to function. (It actually still works, but is so dim as to be useless.), then the yellow, then the red, then about two weeks later it is completely dead. We are having a hard time without it, as the other backup thermometer we have is a chemical strip and very hard to read. I would recommend buying this from a brick and mortar storefront, just because if it has been sitting around for a while and the batteries are dying/dead you can easily exchange it. If the batteries were replaceable it would have gotten 5 stars with a doubt. I do understand though, that it is difficult to make a safe and reliable electronic item that is designed to be fully submersible."
1,"3rd times a charm?? No, didn't work that time either!","The 1st one we had worked for about 2 months, then the 2nd didn't work when we brought it home, and the 3rd didn't have working light indicators."
5,excellent pump !,"works great ... installed easily ... does what it says ... strong little sucker ! only wish I have was that it was adjustable ... water height (pressure) ... other than that ... price, craftmanship and ease of installation ... would definitely buy again."
1,Hunk of junk! In less than 6 weeks of use it lost full strength to pump.,"I have had my KOI pond for about 6 years and this is the worst pump I have ever purchased! It does not even outperform the 10 dollar waterfall pump which is over three years old.In short, do not waste your money or you will end up stuck after 6 weeks having a pump that craps out. I can not even return it because I would lose money shipping it back just to receive a partial refund."
4,Plug and Go,"The pump arrived in perfect condition, its a little frustrating fighting it out of the packaging. Nothing a sharp knife wouldnt solve. I set the tubing up to the pump, dropped the pump in the water, plugged it in and out came the water on the other end. No hicups, no struggling. Very quiet motor considering its size. My only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the inability to adjust water flow. The speed you get is the speed you get. For most applications this is no big deal, however Im using it on a custom made reptile waterfall in my house and now I have to try and manualy disperse the waterflow accross the surface to control the path of the water (its power is causing the water to hit the rocks and shoot across the enclosure like a hose). As for the pump though, it really is a great buy!"
4,Fountain working again,"After chasing around town looking for a replacement pump I remembered that Amazon always had just what I wanted and it was usually available Now!!Thanks again, my fountain is pumping water and we enjoy hearing the water splashing - even the humming birds come and do their bathing in the flow of water,"
5,Beckett 7060110 210 GPH Underwater Pump for small pond,The pump has worked perfectly since we bought it. We use it in a small pond to pump water up through a small fountain.
3,Def. Small ponds,"Without any tubing on this pump it maybe shoots up 14-16 inches, so any project that is a foot high or less would be ideal for this pump"
4,Works well,It has only been running for one season and therefore has not passed the test of time. That being said it worked real well for the past four months and has now been put away for the winter.
3,Be careful -- the power cord is really only 16 feet,"I called Amazon customer service and was ""guaranteed"" that the cord was 20 feet ""because it is based upon the manufacturers description."" I ordered the pump because I need a 20 foot cord and this was the exact model I needed to replace. The new pumps only have a 16 foot cord. Take my word - I had it shipped from Amazon and it is really only 16 feet."
5,Very happy,The Beckett 70602 325 gph Submersible Pump works great in my pond. It never gave me a problem running 24-7. Good product.
2,failed after 9 months,"Loooked like good unit by the reviews however ours failed after only 9 months, now researching how the two year mfg warranty works."
1,"Dead On Arrival, in a used casket","Item had been repackaged, badly, and it was broken. Big disappointment, not up to Amazon standards, although they did not ship it. It is always a big gamble when Amazon does not sell it from stock, rather from a third party. And they will not replace, must wait for a refund. Will not buy from these turkeys again."
2,beckett 210 pump; didn't last long enough,Mine lasted 1.5 years. Ranit 24/7 in a small pond with minimal maintenance other than occasional cleaning. For the price I expected to get a longer life out of the pump. I think I will get more value from a less expensive product.
4,More lost jobs,"Bought this Beckett pump as the last one I had was made in the USA. This one arrives and is made in China. Nothing against the people who made it, but hated to see yet more jobs leave the United States. So far the pump is as good as the last one I had, which would probably still be working had I not dropped it and cracked the housing. Alas."
5,A Definite Classic,"The first time I ever read about controlled shooting was in this book in 1993 when it first came out. Now, everyone in craps talks about how to control the dice. Scoblete did it first and has done it best. This great book is for serious players who want to really look at the game of craps with the intention of actually winning at the game and not just pretending to win. Get this if you are a dedicated player. The other books I recommend are The Craps Underground, Beat the Craps Out of the casinos and Forever Craps, two masterpieces by the master himself."
5,the captains craps revolution,"I believe mr.Scoblete is a true genious.I wish Obama had read his books.We would never have an unemployment,budgetary crisis and national debt.His five point system is nothing but a miracle .He is a saint .There are five fingers on each hand,first time I thougt about girls when I was five years old,and every time I aproach craps table I only look when there are five players.This is how I use his system:first I set the dice, than I count to five and fire ."
1,"This book is full of ignorant, useless advice.","Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this book like I did. This book is full of ignorant, groundless ideas. Twenty dollars spent on a book on probability theory will make you a much wiser craps player than this book will."
2,It's painful to say...,"I will continue to buy his new material as a show of support. I will continue to give all his new material a fair chance and listen with an open mind. I simply can't find anything good to say about Field of Crows. I listened to it sober, drunk, high, happy, sad and indifferent. Each time I found myself skipping to the next track half way through a song. Just plain boring. Mudane vocal performance that don't bring one to care what the lyrical message may be. I love ya Fish, but let's get busy on something interesting eh?"
5,Brilliant,"I'm kind of suprised at some of the bad reviews this album is getting. This is classic Fish! It has a good rock 'n roll feel to it, Numbers, Zoo Class, Moving Targets are some really good rockers. There's also some of the more slow songs, Exit Wound is really good, it has a kind of jazzy feel to it. The best song on this album has to be Innocent Party, this is one of the best Fish songs I've ever heard. How could you not like that song? If you like Fish or Marillion you will certainly like this album. Just don't expect ""Clutching at Straws"" part two."
3,"Works well, but ProPulse/MegaPro car batteries need an adaptor","Once you have the adaptor, this charger works pretty well for the Megatech MegaPro/RadioShack ProPulse RC car batteries. For those batteries you should set the charger to 2 amps. Before you'll be able to use it for these batteries, though, you need to buy a ""MEGATECH MEGAPEAK CONNECTOR FOR MEGAPRO BATTERY"", which is only available, as far as I can tell, from one online retailer, and currently not from Amazon. Just search for that text in google. When you order the adapter from them, make sure you call to place your order, as then they'll offer much cheaper first class mail shipping for the adaptor, or at least they did for me."
4,Murder Me for Nickels,"Tightly plotted noir. Man caught in the middle of a gang take-over of the juke box rackets, multiple girlfriends and a business partner with a hair-trigger temper. Strong characters. Highly recommended."
2,Gratuitous Violence,"This is a thriller about the Juke Box racket, featuring gangsters directed by a mob boss from Chicago, who terrorize bar and restaurant owners into paying for juke boxes and ""service"" they may or may not want on their premises. When the owners refuse, the mob enforcers beat them up. The language is supposed to evoke Damon Runyon or Raymond Chandler, but is a poor copy of their laconic style. You have to expect violence in a story like this but this book overdoes it. We don't need that many broken ribs to be convinced."
1,not my style,book is written in a Hemingway style that I do not enjoy. I finished the book but wasn't quite sure if the writer just stopped writing because he had written his quota of words.
3,My Review for Bionicle Adventures 1; Mystery of Metru Nui,"Hi. My name is Nicholas (I feel I should express my first name)and I purchased this book. I have to say it is a very good book, and I reccomend it. I rate it 3 stars because, although it is good, it is not the best I have read. But it is a real A++ for Greg Farshtey (writer).From a true Bionicle fan, Nicholas"
3,Taken for cold sores,"I am trying to see if taking this supplement will deter cold sores! I have read such a claim, so decided to experiment with it! Here's hoping!"
3,Basic text book,I got this for a college class. Typical over priced text book. I only got it because it was required. It helped a little but calculus is confusing to begin with.
3,Better than nothing - but not much,"The images contained in this Kindle book are very small, and there is no page equivalence (which is very important for reading assignments from the professor which are given as page number ranges; I hope they update it to include page #s soon). The price is nice - $70 instead of $160, & being able to carry around a textbook within my e-tablet is convenient, easier to carry to & from class than an enormous text book."
4,Good Book,This book does a great job of reviewing calculus or teaching calculus to the new or experienced learner. Highly recommended.
4,Good Quality and Fast Service,"I was a bit skeptical to buy a textbook online at first. However, with my purchase I found my worries to disappear. The Applied Calculus book I bought had an overall good quality with the only complaint being that the corners of the book had been folded or somewhat torn. The delivery was also exceptional. I received my book about 1-2 days after ordering online. So far so good. I can't really find anything wrong to say about my purchase."
1,"If you plan to buy this book, PLEASE DON'T, or you'll regret!","There were some problems I couldn't solve by just looking at the solution pages of my textbook, so I bought this solution guide. I hoped it could help me because it has completed and detailed solution. However, the numbers on the guide are odds, in other words, it was formatted as ""1,5,9,13"" instead of ""1,3,5,7"". All the important problems that I had trouble with were omitted.If you have trouble with the problems in your textbook, please don't waste $40 on this solution guide. Just go to math tutors for help."
1,A Bad Math Book,... The layout of the book was confusing and so where theexamples and explanations. If it where not for a great math teacher Iwould have been lost in the class if I was just left to the book alone. I would recommend students and teachers (if your considering this book for your class) to stay away from it... END
3,Harvard,"Sorry to bother you with this review. The authors of this book are distinguished professors at Harvard University (a fine school, no matter what anyone says). Professor Gleason, in particular, is a mathematician of world-historical importance. In a sense, taking lectures from Gleason is not worse than having a lecture from Laplace or Poincare or any of the other great lights of mathematics. I confess that I haven't seen the book or held it between my hands, but I couldn't just leave it here with only a one star review of a disgruntled student. Really, the book has to be better than a single star if Gleason even held it in his hand once."
1,False Solutions. Wrong answers.,"I have found innumerable wrong answers in the back of this calculus book, the answers provided by the counterpart Solutions handbook vary widely from the answers found in the actual textbook. Specifically, check Chapter 3's section ""check your understanding."" I have found almost every true and false answer (out of 50) to be wrong in the back of the textbook (although the solutions handbook indicates the correct answer.) Anyway, Hughes Hallett needs to get their act together. Poor performance. Don't buy the 4th edition."
4,Good Textbook,"This textbook is good, but not great--unless you have an instructor who will interpret the calculus-based applications and problems in the book. Nonetheless, not bad."
3,"step-by-step solution book, but not all solution available.","nice!Example and solution are easy to understand.exercises are helpful, there's no step by step solution for the problems and not all answers are available on the answer sheet."
2,"Ifs, ifs, and more ifs","I would probably have liked this IF there had been more words in the songs. I was expecting the actual SONG, not a few words, music, more words, and some more music. This is a good CD to listen to IF you're the kind of person who likes to listen to music while doing something else."
5,PHAT DANCE TRACK!,"WHENEVER I THROW THIS SONG IN A MIX AT A CLUB, OR PARTY, THE CROWD GOES WILD! ONE THING TO SAY, BUY THIS SONG!"
3,Waiting for MTV remix version,I guess I will go broke trying to find the remix of the Hex Hector MTV version. But its not on this cd and its hard to get into the version they put on this aussie import. Loved the generous stickers of Jennifer and the If You Had My Love remix is weird.
5,Nicest pet bowl I've ever owned,"We live in Colorado so a freeze-resistant pet bowl is a must. This one works well and has adequate capacity so you aren't constantly filling it. One nice feature is you can remove the heating element which makes cleanup easier. The large size and shape of the bowl make use in the dishwasher tough, but it is easy enough to clean by hand."
4,"Works well, but takes ~12-24 hrs.","I'm very prone to ear infections, and my doctor was closed over the holidays. So instead of an expensive trip to the emergency room I tried this product. OTC meds like Advil do nothing for my ear pain, so I picked this up. It doesn't work right away, and in fact I think it even made things a little worse initially. However, the next morning my ear pain went from a 7(so painful it was hard to sleep) on a 1-10 scale to 2(barely there) on the same scale. I highly recommend this product to those looking for an alternative solution to ear pain."
1,It's just glycerine,"I have an itchy ear problem but had not had time to go to the doc. for script, so I bought this. It was soothing, but I read the box and it is glycerine with a homeopathic (read: fake b.s.) ingredient. I felt so stupid for the amount I paid for glycerine. If you don't know why homeopathy is pseudoscience, just read up on it (in Wikipedia or a science article). The premise was developed 80+ years ago and is based on diluting some herb down to nothing and the water has a ""memory"" of the ingredient - totally violates natural law. Ear candling, foot detoxing, same crap. Don't spend your money on scams! Alternative medicine that works is called ""medicine."" Medications are from natural products or chemicals (which are also part of nature). I don't overmedicate, but I keep up with the science...well, so much for ear drops."
5,Great Reference Guide,"Even if you have the luxury of an attorney that speicalizes in art contracts, as I do, this is a great book of forms to keep handy for quick reference. My advice is to get it with his other book: Legal Guide for the Visual Artist also by Tad Crawford"
3,Not as nice as it looks,"Not as nice as set appears in pictures, hard to make a Nativity scene out of it , figures do not stand up , very hard to get the concept that I wanted yet it was good for a little one to describe the point of the Nativity. Would not recommend it."
4,Feel-good melodic rock n roll,"It's obvious from the first listen that ""Wind It Up"" doesn't really have an original bone in its body, the most obvious influences being Def Leppard, Chicago, and Winger. But is building upon the work of such great bands a crime? Brian McDonald's sophomore release rocks with crunching guitars and soaring vocals (and harmonies). Add in wall-of-sound production, and you've got a huge-sounding album full of power anthems and ballads."
1,book never received,"We never got the book, however, the seller was very nice to us and will refund the money."
3,More Precious than Schubert,"Schubert once screamed at some fellow composers that they were unfit to scrape the worms from the bottom of his boots. I think if one could read Jeff Mangum's mind, he would be thinking aloing similar lines. The stage banter on this coffee-house live record supports this view. He seems like a truly annoying man. The songs are good, but there is a baby crying throughout much of the album which, coupled with mangum's approach, make cd pretty average."
5,Classic Winston,George Winston knows how to create the mood of each season in his piano compositions. Wonderful background music. My favorite (of his work) is December. I ordered this by mistake as we already have it and Amazon made it easy for me to manage. Thank you.
3,OK but could get real boring real quick,I bought the Summer Album in order to see if was worth going to a concert that is going to be in Santa Fe soon...on the basis of the album.. i decided not to sepnd the money for the concert...this is too much plinky plinky music that tends to have your mind wonder if soemof the melodies were sped up a bit that you would hear some jingles from tv adds.. ok in small doses or if you like to go to sleep listening to soft plinky music... but not for me.
2,Not great.,"Why George would want to give away royalties by recording other people is a mystery to me. His music is to extraordinary that I really do prefer to hear his original compositions. I have always hated Randy Newman and do not want to hear his music, even if it's been ""Winstonized"". Not bad but not great. George's own pieces on this cd are terrific but there aren't enough of them."
4,squeeze action power wrenck,"i like the power wrench because it makes it easier to tighten bolts that are in hard to reach places, and it also makes it easier when the bolts are too small for a regular wrench."
5,Clothed in Armor and Epithets,"This is an excellent book. The author presents two aspects of the epics, the action in 1200BC, and the story in 800BC. He presents The Iliad, for example, in these two aspects; a war that happened in 1200BC, and the epic itself as a poem from 800BC, and also the window from which we observe that war. In the war the Homeric heroes are clothed and defined as heroes by their armor. (""Without our armor we are as naked as women."") In the poem itself they are linguistically clothed and defined by their epithets. Each line in Homer has six slots to fill, does he just add two adjectives and an adverb to each SOV sentence to fill them? No, the author's careful analysis of the Heroic epithets draws out their meaning and contribution to the story. What readers often sense today as needless repetition, to Homer's hearers in 700BC must have seemed like animation and dramatic emphasis.Prof. Peter C. Patton, Ph.D."
4,Another use,"I use this to spray the siding on my home when there's mold. It does what I need it to do, which is spray bleach and water to the 2nd story of my home."
3,Not bad.,"Not a bad video. Documentary about Shawn going to Japan. More narration than I thought, not enough actual snowboarding. But, the powder footage is pretty good."
5,GREAT!,"I really enjoyed this film because you get to see Shaun, and other pro snowboarders, just having fun. They all head to Japan to take a ""breather"" and just snowboard for fun and just do what they wanted to do! I also loved seeing them all act just like normal guys their age (buying air-soft guns and randomly attacking each other with them, making jumps in snow covered streets out of boredom...). It makes you wish you were out there with them!"
3,Nix about Movies! An important feature of Corel Photo Paint!,"Recent versions of Corel Photo Paint have had valuable potential for making quick-time movies (for titles in digital movies, etc.) The Corel ""factory"" book has many pages about this aspect of their software. The Huss book, which seems to be just a slight rewrite, with only strictly necessary updates, of earlier versions, is TOTALLY silent on the subject of movies. How can the author ignore this ""new"" feature? For me, this is the MAIN reason for my using Corel Paint. So, no vote from me! I have also found the Huss book to be very weak on the subject of Color Management, an area where one really needs expert guidance, and where one would expect a book by an expert to be particularly detailed."
4,"Take That, Photoshop","As with any complex application, the power lies in the unique knowledge of what can be done and how. Fortunately, this book manages to recognize the line between enlightenment and obfuscation, remaining clearly on the side of helpful information.From it's introduction to it's indepth techniques, Corel PP-9 remains both a tutorial and a reference. If you need unlimited image processing skill, this is a great place to start."
4,Work of Excellence,"The book is truely one of a kind, by painting a new face to PhotoPaint's tools and features. It will learn you how to enjoy your job through exploring the PhotoPaint workspace.Even if you are new in the Graphic Design industry, this book is recomended for both, professionals and beginers.Learn all the amazing ways of producing high quality and professional graphic art, and enjoy the langauge of comfort written by the authur."
4,Life of slack,"If you want to live the life of slack of your dreams like me, this book is a good starting point. Learn how not to make money, not have ambition (except to be a slacker), and how to not impress people! It seemed like a pretty good book, but I lacked the motivation to finish it. Sigh...."
1,Not What I Was Expecting,"When I was reviewing my order online it looked great, even had a 97% rating. When I got the work out ball the pump was missing the needle and the whole on the ball to pump it up was also missing a piece. No matter what I tried there was no way I could pump up the ball, so this was just a waste of money."
1,Web description is the wrong size.,"I never got to use the product. Upon opening, I realized the sizing details on Amazon's website was different than the one on the box. I am 5'5"" and the 65cm was too big for me although Amazon states it's just my size."
1,The Ball that wouldn't hold air,"This ball is a total piece of crap. I inflated it to the maximum psi and after an hour it deflated by about 25%. I tried again and the same thing happened, then once more and then gave up. It now is in my gear closet and I am trying to figure out what to do with it...hmmm....perhaps I can make an umbrella out of it."
1,Not for people with arthritis or joint pain... Ouch!,"The reason I gave it one star is because of how it affected my body. I am an athletic person and very agile, but this is one of the workouts that I will never do again.I have arthritis and that causes major joint pain and this workout focused all the pain unto my joints in my knees and I was in tears. I had to stop this workout about 5 minutes into it. My knees were hurting for almost 3 days after and I could hardly walk.I'm sure if you are in perfect health this might work for you, but if you have any type of arthritis or any joint pain, please stay away from the ball workout."
2,firm ball too small after a week,"I ordered this ball to use as a chair in my office occasionally. I liked the color so I decided to pay a little more and get this one. The pump that comes with it works fine and I was able to pump it up without much of a problem although it does take a while. I was disappointed that the ball was not the shiny green color it looks like in the picture, it is actually a pearlescent paler green but still not bad. Originally the ball blew up to only 50cm, but it does indicate that the ball will grow over the first few days. Basically over the course of the next week, by sitting on it and stretching it I was able to get it to about 60cm but it was still smaller than advertised and way to small to use as a chair for a person who is 5'8."
2,mediocre at best,"This ball is very difficult to get inflated all the way. Furthermore, even allowing it to stretch for several days, it still is not the advertised size. I don't enjoy working out with this. Bought it for P90X2."
3,Would love it if DVD worked,"I am trying to lose the post pregnancy pouch, and thought this was a good alternative to other at-home floor routines. However, my DVD skips to the middle of the exercise! This is the disc, not the player, as I tried it in other players/computer. But I must say, before realizing I was missing half the routine, I found the exercises to be uncomplicated and effective, and my core was sore for 2 days...I can only imagine what I would've felt like after the whole exercise! If I can get a DVD that worked, I would rate this 5 stars."
5,Very Happy,"Product as described, good quality. Also came with a workout DVD which I have yet to use, but am looking forward to doing so."
5,Great and Inspirational,This video was very inspirational and historically accurate. It would be a great benefit for everyone to watch as it portrays the hardships that can be caused by human arrogance but especially it shows us where to find the ability to help us to triumph over any oppression.
4,A story about a family during WWII.,"This movie was shown in my church years ago. It has always stayed with me. It is taken from the book ""The Hiding Place"" about the life of a Dutch citizen Corrie Tin Boom and how her family strived to save the Jews from certain destruction. If you have read the book just like many movies it leaves out some of the more interesting factors, but none the less it is an inspiring movie."
5,Inspirational,"This story of a Dutch watchmaker's family hiding Jews and others from the Nazi occupiers of their country is a most inspiring portrayal of practical faith. It led the family to concentration camp and death. The hope and faith the sisters showed when suffering in prisom camp is a fine testimony to God keeping those who trust Him, both in death and in life. Watch it and be encouraged. One slight cricism. It did not seem clear on what happened to those in the hiding place when the Germans imprisoned the family."
4,Very Good,This video is a wonderful portrayal of the compassion and selflessness that we should all have for those in need.
3,The Hiding Place,The jacket for this VHS was in bad shape. I gave it to a school for watching and I'm hoping that the VHS tape was okay.
5,Inspiring true story of faith,This is the inspiring story of a family willing to pay the ultimate price to save Jewish people during the holocaust. It is uplifting to see the faith of the family during the world's darkest times.
2,"shabby filming, dreary","I saw this DVD after reading the book and was very disappointed. The actors speak in monotones, the dialogue is mediocre and even the camera angles seem to be the efforts of an amateur. This movie offered no comic relief, although the book had a few humorous moments."
2,The Hiding Place CD,"Service was excellent. The movie is one of my favorites. However, it is a cheap copy at best. It is supposed to be brand new, came sealed as such, but it has skips in it."
1,It Stinks,"This may be the worst movie ever. The photography is so-so, the make-up may have worked if the movie was in black and white, but it is laughable in color. The story is tripe; The constant reference to unrealistic religion is sickening. After way too long of this story dragging on we turned it off, with great relief."
5,Real Christianity in Time of Worldwide Crisis,"The story of Corrie Ten Boom is both tragic and inspiring. Her families' sacrifice is the epitome of Christ's. They were Giants - true heroes during the darkest times in recent western European history. Everyone, Christian or not, should watch this movie. It establishes a high standard of behavior that could change the world if more of us imitated it. On a side note: the widescreen picture was quite good."
4,great for the whole family,"Great Movie,...but the Book is alot better. Corrie Ten Boom is an amazing lady...we see through her the horrific holocaust and how God was in the midst of His people ..still."
4,Please read the book too.,"The story is amazing. The movie itself was good, but it doesn't touch the book. There are thoughts, feelings and content that cannot be expressed or addressed in a movie that does not include narration and/or run for 5 to 6 hours. If you read the book first you will follow the story more easily (much of the background included in the book is absent from the movie), but you may be more disappointed in the movie overall because of what is missing. I think the movie is for those who refuse to read the book and shouldn't miss out on a very powerful story. Personally I wouldn't trade the experience of the book for almost anything. It was life changing."
2,Good but too Preachy,"Good movie showing how one family made a difference for the Jews in WW ll. However leaned way too much on their beliefs in religion during the years in the Concentration Camp. Easy to see why ""Billy Graham Presents""..."
4,Stranger than fiction...,"A consistently interesting compendium of human and paranormal anomalies that starts off with some astounding freak show attractions and then gets into a wide variety of unusual people, like idiot savants, psychics, reincarnations, automatic writing conduits, dowsers, possessed people, Edgar Cayce, and more. It's kind of a random assemblage, but that keeps it from getting repetitive. Definitely one of the better collections out there."
2,It a pencil sharpener with tiny ice cubes,"When they say small ice tray, they mean SMALL ice tray. Basicaly this is a pencil sharpener with a tiny ice tray. You can save time by getting a cup of ice from McDonalds and biting the ice cubes in half...and then they may still be to big! The three ice cubes shaved make about one spoonfull of shaved ice. But what the heck, its worth the price just to show friends and laugh about."
5,Yow,There are some great pieces on this CD. Marwa in the pines makes me want to howl with joy (and i often do) when i hear it. Edgar Meyer rocks!
5,A Wonderful Book,This was a great book - filled with terrific insight into old Hollywood and the world of celebrity. A very fun read.
5,really good stuff!,"If you need to restrict sugar or are just calorie conscience, this is the product for you. Preparation is fast and easy, and more importantly it tastes delicious. It is available in several flavors, but I like chocolate the best. Amazon offers big savings coupons on this every now and then."
3,All large systems fail,"Every system will expand to fill the univerese, corrupting all that it comes in contact with. that is the entire book. a few storys, ect. but that is it. THE WHOLE BOOK."
4,highly entertaining,"Who doesn't relish a good witch/ghost story? Phillip DePoy delivers this in fine form. His new book is a good choice to take to the beach. There in the bright sunlight you'll find chills comes over you as you read this wonderfully entertaining, at times light-hearted, tale of strange goings-on in the Georgia Appalachians."
5,Great game!,"Awesome long lost final fantasy game! Too bad nintendo decided to send over mystic quest to the US instead of this one when they came out with it! I bet they would have made a lot more money! They job system is a lot of fun and the game is classic final fantasy. Tons of hours of gameplay, great soundtrack, and a fun job system makes this one a must have for anyone who loves the final fantasy franchise. Extras added for the advance version make it that more fun like more jobs, an extra dungeon, and better translation then the playstation version that came out years ago. If your a fan of final fantasy, this is not one to pass up."
5,Reviews for FF 5 advance,"A fabulous rpg, I love this game. This is the third best rpg of the Snes !! Please buy him !!"
4,Good Follow -up to FFIV!,"This game is great fun. I like the ability to change the job function in this game. It gives each character more diveristy and all become stronger quicker this way! The graphics are about the same as FFIV an before but, thats to be expected and thats what I've alwayed loved about these games. I'm 30 years old and this brings me back to when I was younger playin on nintendo 64 and Nintendo.:two thumbs up:"
4,overall great game,overall i don't usually type reviews but i thought id be nice for once why not.contained saved games from previous owned so i could not only view bonus dungeons in their entirety (run through them) but check out cloister of the dead (really fun) but i also got a look at the gear equipped to the characters which is good because this way i was able to start a new game from sctratch and know what gear i need to get later so i can play these extra areas and actually defeat the extra bosses myself.
3,Not Connie's best but not her worst...,"I really loved this book all the way until Sierra became reunited with her brother and sister. When that point happened this book dropped from a five to a three. The main reason I didnt like the book past that point was Sierra's brother, Cole. I didnt like how he pretty much took over her life with Ram. He had not seen his sister since she was little and he thought he could control her life with Ram. Aside from annoying Cole, the book was good. I really did like Sierra and Ram they were great together and they had wonderful chemistry."
5,Great quality!,"I was very surprised by the quality of this item. It's very large & sturdy weave is awesome, and it's super warm, very comfortable to wrap around. It's not totally double sided, but it looks pretty well finished from the back as well."
5,handy handy,Very easy to use reference book that had some good pics and some humor thrown in for good measure.
1,Really!!!,"When I purchased this costume it said it came with the shirt, pants, hat and chain. When I received it in mail it said on the package: ""Hat and chain sold seperately"". Thanks for the incomplete Halloween costume!! Oh and thanks for taking longer to ship then 3-5 days, so much for wearing it to this years party even though I ordered it Monday October 22nd. Will never buy from you again for next costumes for me, my wife or kids!!! Thanks Rubie's, keep up the great work."
1,Only Works with IOGear headphones,The product description didn't make it clear that this product is designed onlly to work with iogear headsets.Useless to me. Will be looking to sell.
1,"it works ONLY with iogear headphones, no exception","I own this adaptor, which comes with iogear wireless headphonesthis adaptor works ONLY with iogear wireless headphone, tried the following (all are 0000 passcode)Logitech ""broken headband"": does not pairLubix NC1: refuse to connectBluespoon Spider: refuse to connectAltec Lansing T515: refuse to connectPlantronics 590: refuse to connectmotorola S705: refuse to connectI have 4 other audio adaptors (including this one), the one with Logitech works with Bluespoon Spider; the one with Plantronics works with ALL headphones with passcode 0000, same as Ever E (for PSP)conclusion: DO NOT buy it if you don't have iogear wireless headphones"
1,Replacement part only,Tried this product on various Bluetooth products and it works with none. DOES NOT work on motorola headphones as stated in last review. (which was the only reason I bought this adapter because it said it would) The package it came in was even made to be sold with the IOgear headphones. It looks as if the only reason to buy this was if you already had one and it broke. Again do not buy this if you do not have the IOgear bluetooth headphones that go with it!
3,Good to watch,I watched this and enjoyed the fun of it. Wasn't to serious but I got to relax. Thanks
3,Not good and not bad...,"In the middle of the road as my rating shows...if you like Stephen Chow then get it; otherwise, there are others better!"
4,Fun to watch,If you want some good old comedy then this is it. Stephen Chow is a master at making you laugh. Over the top to say the least. It is really good to have around to cheer me up. So pop some corn and enjoy a good laugh.
5,Yard Machines 158cc Push Lawn Mower (Non-CARB Compliant) #11A-034F200,"I could not beleive this price. This lawn mower is very powerfull!!!I had electric mower before and having gas mower is really blessing. I would recommend this product to everyone, much easier to deal with gas and oil then electricity and flipping the cable. This is very cheap for what it does. I also had some gift certificates so I was very happy with price."
1,darpab,"I was very disappointed in the product. The lawnmower was delivered to my home in an open but taped box. It looked like the item was used. All the parts weren't with it (screws, washers, etc). I had to take parts from my old broken lawnmower to get this one together. If I didn't need to cut my grass so desparetely, I would have packaged it back up and sent it back. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Zombies in Da' Hood .....,"This is the Worst No-Budget Garbage I have ever Seen. Absolutely no production values. The acting is beyond terrible, and the zombies are just gangsta's running around with fake blood on their shirts growling...LAME! (and there are only 4 or 5 zombies throughout) How they can make this stuff and package it in a slick dvd Cover and sell it for $20....I'll never understand, It Isn't even worth the price af a Rental. Don't waist your time or money on this one, unless you like backyard movies shot on someones camcorder."
1,Are they serious?,"Just because this is a B-Movie doesn't excuse the fact that it contains sub par acting, bad special effects and a serious lack of direction. I like a good zombie flick like the next horror buff. But I will not excuse this movie's weaknesses merely on the basis that it is a B- Movie. Even though this is a low budget film the viewer still expects to be mildly entertained. This film was just downright atrocious. George Romero's movies were made on a very low budget as well and they turned out to be cult classics.If a movie is low budget and the acting isn't the greatest than it should atleast beef up on the writing and plot. This movie fails miserably at that. I don't understand how anyone could give this a five star rating not unless they were brain dead or trying to mislead someone into throwing their hard earned money on this waste of time film.Sorry, but this film is a low blow to the zombie horror genre."
1,not for me,"i originally bought this product to help me gain weight but this product often made my stomach upset and made me feel uneasy and nauseated, it's not for me but it might work for someone else"
4,"Not really tasty, but it get's the job done","I have a medical condition that requires me to drink Nutren to maintain my weight. I'll admit that the formula isn't really tasty, ( just chug it) but it has kept me in my target weight and healthy for years."
1,What a joke!,I couldn't get the suction cups to stick to my tub. I tried polygrip and even that wouldn't work. The item seemed too heavy to be held up with only suction cups. I wouldn't recommend this item.
2,In a pile on the floor,"I couldn't get the thing to stay up even when I used silicone adhesive on the suction cups. The silicon worked for a few weeks, now, the corner organizer is on the floor with the toys piled on top. Great concept, poor execution."
3,Doesnt last long,This was good the first few weeks we had it up but then it grew very weak and was unable to support toys. Colors also faded very quickly... was good while it worked but wouldnt purchase again.
1,Didnt stick to our walls,Unfortunately we followed the directions and it didnt stick to our walls and fell down repeatedly. Never even made it 24 hours. Finally threw it out. We dont have tile but the moulded walls. I dont know if that makes a difference.
5,If you love Jazz or Lupin III you will love this cd !!!!,"I am a big Jazz fan and an even bigger Lupin III fan and this cd is well GREAT.The best track on the cd is Lupin The Third which is a cool mix of Jazz and the Lupin III theme.While most of the tracks are very good the worst track on the cd would have to be ""Cat Walk"" im not saying that it is bad it just isnt as good as the other tracks on this cd. Overall this is a great cd to get if your into Jazz or Lupin III."
4,I think Dad liked it.,This was a gift for my dad who is really hard to buy for. He seemed pleased with the gift. I was pleased with the fast shipping by Amazon.
2,Too many bad movie prints,I have gone through 5 of the 10 DVDs and all the prints with the exception of one were terrible to watch. Most were extremely grainy. some bordered on unwatchable. If you invested in a plasma or LCD and/or HD TV you will cringe at these movies. These movies are good for putting in an ordinary TV set and watching them while dusting. The sound tracks are unimpressive as well.Also at least three of the CD's have flaws that cause the movies to skip and loose track or not play at all. You will have to fiddle with it. If you have more than one DVD player you will have to keep trying until a DVD works.
3,Oldies but goodies,"For anyone interested in old sci-fi movies, this collection pretty well has something for everyone. This is not for sci-fi buffs that lean toward the modern computer generated films. Admittedly some of the titles are pretty cheesy, however, that was what made them appealling originally. Would rate it as a must have for the true sci-fi fanatic."
3,A mix bag of lollies,"A mix bag of lollies,Is how i sum it up - some classics that are worth viewing that you would watch a second time some old 50'-60's b&w; that are cleaver , some are simply plain ""cheesy"" and other the quality is so bad they shouldn’t have been put in there in the first place. But what else do you expect? a star war collection? “Well, that will be double the price –sir”,... any way I also brought also ""Sci-fi Classics "" and say this probably the better of the two sets. Plus you only need to put disc in once to play four movies where as ‘classic’ it's two movies side and need to flip over.If you like si fi buy it....if you want cheap movies don't...J.M 4/1/2013"
3,It was a gift,I bought it as a gift to my step son for fun to give him more then videos games but to watch other things like old movies and shows. He watch 2 of them and likes them. I watched one of them and was shocked. It is far quality and interesting . For the price a long entertament its worth it.
3,"Worth the money, but not by much.","I am a major classic SciFi fan, and have several collections. The file format on these DVD's is a little clunky, and the quality of the images is not consistent. Almost like watching them in person during the decade they were made! :)"
4,Good value/Good features,This collection has several interesting features and the transfer process is generally quite good. A good value for fifty films..but be advised some of the films in this collection barely qualify as sci fi..
1,The Alien Factor Not in Public Domain and Not Licensed for this package,"Must be nice to just throw in stuff from old vhs that you have laying around,but The Alien Factor is still copyright by Cinemagic Visual Effects and the onlyauthorized releases are the Cinematic Titanic release and the full-length versionwe put out on YouTube."
3,Not completely as described.,"SciFi Invasion???? Nope. For example, out of four videos on first disk, only one was nearly ""invasion"", and it was really bad. I like campy movies, but this was a bit much. The other three were just not ""invasion"" at all, just really bad scifi...really bad. I will not purchase a ""bargain"" product like this again."
1,wast,"The cover looks good but the movies where bad, all of them where movies that must have never gotten played no more than one time.If you love cheap, badly written, low buget (very low) movies then this set of movies is for you."
3,The Drive-In Third Feature You Somehow Missed,"You're parked in the back row of the Drive-In for a triple feature date night. It is 2:00 am and very bright lights come on; the movies are over. You fumble around, throw the speaker on the ground, drive out as fast as you can and again . . . you have absolutely no idea what that third feature was all about. You read on the marquis: ""Female Aliens in Nebraska"" or some such title.Now here is a collection of 50 those ""Movies"" that you were too ""preoccupied"" to watch then. You didn't miss much. There is a reason why they were third . . . and you'll find out why.But it's a great trip down memory lane; well worth the price. And if you never heard of the Drive-In, you're in for a special treat. Watch these ""movies,"" laugh hard and just try to think of why Grand Ma or Grand Pa can't remember them."
3,Movies are us,"We have enjoyed the fact that we have never seen most of these movies before. They are definitely lacking in the special effects professionalism, but still interesting and this surprisingly without gore. These are for sci-fi fans of all ages."
3,It's,While not edge of the seat reading but it did offer valuable insight into the day to day life in the trenches. An easy read and well worth your time.
3,Object of my desire,"I will have to admit that I only listen to one song on the cd. I just love ""object of my desire"" my favorite."
5,starpoint,i'm a fan of starpoint love the voice of ms. Diggs she really had a story to tell she will be miss but the music will live on.
5,Starpoint - Object of My Desire and Other Hits,"I'm so happy to have this CD. As an 80's kid, I loved many R&B; musical bands and Starpoint was one of the hot R&B; musical bands of this decade. It saddens me that in today's musical environment there aren't many R&B; musical bands together and actively recording (e.g. Mint Condition, Kool & The Gang, and Earth, Wind & Fire).After recently recylcing my Starpoint cassettes (covering their first 4 albums), I was elated to find this compilation CD because I cannot find their 4 albums (as CDs) anywhere in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. Thank you amazon.com for making my continued listening to Starpoint's music possible."
5,great find - after serching for any CD from this group.,"I was very happy to find this cd, and a lot of other choices still available to purchase for the group ""starpoint""....I was actually looking for 1 particular song titled ""Till the end of time"" and wound up with a fantastic cd which had a lot of other hits I had forgotton they also sang....thanks [...] for catering to a vast list of artist, music...old and new."
4,Difficult to Use If You're Used to a Windows Machine,"I used this computer for a high school graphics arts class. Most of the computers my school had were Gateways with Windows on them, with the expection of one student lab and the graphics arts department.I had a custom built Windows mutt at home and found using an Apple to be a bit of a challenge because the shortcut codes I was used to using didn't work.However, after about a week, I was proficient in both. Even though I use primarily an HP Pavilion at home, I can use the Apple computers we have at our college newspaper office pretty well, with only having to ask for help occasionally."
2,cheesy and fun in a lousy way,"uhh . . . the movie's set in 60s Stockholm, so the ""Victorian England"" comments in the previous review must be about another version of FANNY HILL. This one is updated to the 1960s and is poorly acted--and not very erotic--but it's a goof that's worth a few (unintentional) chuckles in its ineptitude"
4,Wisdom from a man of God,This is an outstanding book of how easy it can be to let the devil infiltrate your life. Father Amorth's words were very direct and to the point. I was particularly interested in reading more about the musical tones and Hard Rock music that was dedicated to Satin prior to being released on CD's. Since most of us are baby boomer age we pretty much grew up on Hard Rock and I would of liked to have had more facts and examples in that area. A list of song distribution company names etc.
5,The Truth Regarding the Spiritual Realm,"I found Fr. Amorth's work very engaging and displays well the ongoing battle between good and evil. I highly recommend this work, especially for those Diocesan exorcists looking for study material on the subject.Fr. Brent"
5,to understand the reasoning of prayer,"One of the basic reasons we pray is to be delivered from evil, and this Author hasshown the necessity for prayer in the Christian life."
4,Follow up to a great book,This is the second book as a follow up to Fr. Amorth's first book an Exorcists Tale. More of the same.
5,"Great storyline, emotional!","Logan Drake returns home to Turnabout Island to bring back his friend's runaway daughter, Riley. She showed up on her aunt's, Annie Hess', doorstep. Logan and Annie both have secrets in their pasts and the truth of it all unravels within the week that they spend together amidst the terrible storm that hits the island.This is the 2nd book in the Turnabout series from Allison Leigh. I love this story. It makes you feel and think and dream. Such a terrific author! I have read many of her books and can always count on her characters coming to life with tenderness and passion."
3,For those interested in Literate Programming.,This book is the book about WEB. It is very technical and includes information about WEB and CWEB. It is written in the same style as ``The CWEB System of Structured Documentation''.
1,uninspired and boring.,Very disappointed in this CD. The pianist is uninspired and the arrangements are boring. The flute player and the vocalist add nothing to the project. I decided to buy this because of the one good rating it had. Must have been from a family member.
1,I thought this book was horrible,I bought this book online and was not able to see it like I would in a book store. Had I seen it I would never have purchased this book and will never read it to my 6 year old son! It went from suggesting eating your dinner quickly to wiping a dirty jar on your close to cutting holes in a jar lid with scissors quietly so your mom won't catch you. One of the illustrations shows a boy holding scissors wide open with his hand on the inside of the open blades. I would never read it to any child and think the message is just horrible. Yes it is fun to catch fireflys but I know this could have been done better without the dangerous suggestions and disregard for listening to adults and being careful!
3,More textbook than anything,"This is a useful book to have around when needing information on just about anything relating to palm horticulture. The only thing I was somewhat disappointed in though, was the lack of cultural information on specific palms. I was expecting something more like how best to grow this specific palm and then turn the page and go on to info. on how to grow the next one. This was more of a general and broad coverage of palms. But this might have been more my expectations were different, as the book is and will be very useful. But sometimes I just like to be able to look at a picture of a mature palm, read all the in's and outs of growing it, and dream or plan of fitting it into my landscape."
4,Ornamental Palm Horticulture,"A pure technical book, great for the farmers of palms. Everything you want to know about palms but not a palm's identification book. This book have only a few photos."
2,Limited Palm Horticulture Information,"I found that there was a great deal of information on possible diseases and disorders of palms. However, my main disappointment was on the real lack of information on types of palm trees and the type of soil and climate needed. I would have liked to have had more information on the cold resistant palm trees. There was hardly any information on the species of palm trees. I found much more information just surfing the internet on palm trees than what I found in the book. I think that I could have made a much more interesting book if I had done a compilation of information from contributors off the internet! I either will sell the book as used or utilize it to assist in recognizing possible diseases or deficiencies. It would have been nice to have had more information on rare palm tree distributors of seed and/or plants as well."
2,Limited cultural information,"This book is an attempt to guide those interested in palm horticulture. However, finding that palm horticulture varies widely between the species, I found this title a disappointment. Some palms can't take iron for instance, but the authors neglect to give specific information on those species which would be helpful. The same applies to those palms that need iron. As a general guide, the book is ok, but if you really need to know how to care for your exotic and rare palms you may need advice from the local botanical garden or a nursery that specializes in growing palms to determine the nutritional requirements of a specific genus."
5,A hot item all athletes should read.,"The Dixie Association is an excellent book. It constantly has new twists and turns, some expected, some not.As an athlete, I feel all athletes should have the same attitude as Hog, the main character. He is not playing for the money, but for the love of the sport. Now days, professional athlete feel they deserve a huge sum of money just to play a game they played for free as little kids. I think all athletes should read this book for a new perspective about the games they love."
5,Baseball and beyond.,"This was one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. Although the story is played out in a baseball environment, you really don't have to be a baseball fanatic or even a sports fan to get caught up in the drama and exicetment of this novel. The main characters are all well depicted and they each have conflicts they must resolve both on the baseball field and in society. There is a quagmire of underlying themes, and you can't help but become intrigued with at least one aspect of this story."
5,An Easy Read About A Perplexing Figure,"This is the first secondary source of which I am aware that takes as established the survival of SS-Grueppenfuehrer Heinrich Mueller after World War II (see the volumes by Gregory Douglas on Mueller published by R. James Bender, San Jose, CA).It is well written, at a junior-high to high school level, and although the first of the ""Holocaust Biographies"" series for juvenile readers I have seen, if it is representative of their quality, it is a harbinger of an excellent group of books. This book also provides good explanations of Fascist/Nazi motivations, their actions, and the Holocaust. It also discusses the complex motivations of such a man as Mueller himself, who rose from obscurity to one of the highest and most important positions in the Reich.Regarding Mueller, it is mostly definitive, and will introduce the young reader to the perplexing vicissitudes of foe-becomes-friend as loyalties shift in our modern world."
2,Not quiet = not cool,"I don't know why they call the low fan setting a quiet/bedroom setting. That thing is loud! My much larger 5 gallon hunter humidifier is much quieter than this thing. It also does not shut off when the water runs out. It happily keeps on blowing. It would be nice to have a smaller humidifier that still has the nice features. I didn't want to buy a huge humnidifier for the small room that I need it for, so I got this one. Aside from the noise and really having to keep an eye on the water, it works fairly well. The pieces are dishwasher safe, which is nice if you use your dishwasher a lot (I don't)."
2,Automatic shut off doesn't work,"Contrary to the product description, this humidifier does not automatically shut off when the water is empty. Also, unless positioned properly the holding tank will dump all the water (on your floor). Not as loud as other small humidifiers but louder than the larger TrueAir model."
1,Terrible!!,"This humidifier is horrible. The thing is loud!! Yeah right it has a quiet mode. Also, the water container does get everywhere. The water leaks out and makes a mess. Also, the filter has to constantly be changed. If you use the filter while your child is sick put the humidifier away for a month you have to get another filter. You cna't really feel any mist coming out and it doesn't shut off automatically. I returned this humidifier and got a comparbly priced one from Vicks. It is not that loud, granted none of them are quiet and the water container is big and the filter is reusable for more than one use."
3,Compact and efficient,"This little unit is both compact and efficient, but is noisier than I would have expected or wanted. I purchased it for my office and it has helped tremendously. I was concerned when I received it- although packaged securely, there was a small crack in the motor housing- it doesn't seem to affect it's operation however."
1,not recommended- ruined our hardwoods,This humidifier leaks every time we use it. It has warped our hardwood floors. We currently have it sitting in a tray until we purchase a new one. It does not automatically turn of when the water runs out. I do not recommend this product.
2,SO LOUD,Thought this would be great to use since the water tub goes into the dishwasher. I never liked getting out the bleach and vinegar to clean my other one. But this one is SOOOO LOUD!!! I don't mind it too much since it will put me to sleep but I can not hear my children over the loud hum of the machine! I like to hear them when using this so I know they are comfortable and not getting to the croupy stage.
1,Horrible-Leaked twice on my hardwood floors!,"I bought this humidifier for the dishwasher safe feature, however was unable to put it in my dishwasher because I use ""jet dry."" It leaked on the hardwood floors (twice). In addition, the filter only lasted about 2 weeks."
3,This is an okay humidifier,This humidifier is okay. It does the job for small rooms. It only has two settings. It's also a little louder than I would like. The tank is cumbersome and kind of difficult to fill. But it does work well and a full tank can last more than 24 hours. It's a decent buy for the money.
2,No Mist Was Harmed In The Making Of This Unit,"Hamilton Beach has started us all down the slippery slope by using ""mist"" in the name of a non-ultrasonic humidifier. That's already alarming, but I already knew this was a filter-type. (Rest assured, by the time the filter's grungy, the only available replacement filters will be for newer models with slightly different filter dimensions.) Reviews indicated this unit is reasonably quiet, but like most import units, it has a small, overworked fan that makes lots of turbulence, and therefore lots of noise. On the flip side, that urgent little fan does move quite a bit of air, and the unit is built very solidly. Even so, if I had it to do over again, I'd spend a little more for a fanless model."
4,Entertaining and informative,"Mr. Engel's latest book is as entertaining as it is informative. Through a series of colorful examples, the author examines the most common fallacies in the use of words and language. Though at times the topics addressed are obvious and some chapters are redundant, overall his treatment of language and its pitfalls is generally compelling and well worth the time it takes to read this gem of a book."
2,very limited supported devices,"This gadget is supposed to act as a USB device server, meaning you're supposed to be able to access ANY USB device connected to it, over the network from any networked PC (on the same subnet). Neat.The hardware itself and software is very good-- very stable. Connected to a LAN, you can set the IP address manually or via DHCP. There's a client software that you install on your pc, which then connects to the usb server and lists all usb devices connected to it. You can either connect or disconnect the device virtually to your pc.This all sounds great, but it doesn't work with ALL USB devices. You need to check Silex's compatibility list and see if your device is in it. This list is very short -- too short for me to get any usefulness out of it.Everything else-- ease of use, software, installation, etc-- gets a 5 star."
2,Not compatible with HP LaserJet 3015...,"I had a similar experience with the reviewer here. It has a much more stable driver than the KeySpan USB (4-A)'s, but it simply is not compatible -- even with a brand like Hewlett Packard! It can sometimes recognizes the printer but can't print, scan, or fax."
3,A not so deep book,"The book doesn't go deep into customizing AutoCAD, but gives a complete brief overview for general purpose AutoCAD usage."
2,disappointing,"We bought this book hoping to learn about American Indian costumes. What we got was a brief summary on each tribe, nothing much in depth nor nothing we had not known before. We were hoping for pictures. There are very few pictures of Indians in costume in the book. The best picture is on the cover. If we had seen the book before we bought it, we probably would have passed on it."
3,American Indian dress.,An interesting book for all who want to research the dress/costume of the great american tribes. However the illustrations are in black and white only.
5,Experimenting with instruments and musical styles,"These are the 3 first albums of Flairck spread over 2 CD's :Variaties op een Dame (English : Variations on a Lady)Gevecht met de Engel (English : The Lady's Back; the original Dutch title, translated as ""Fight with the Angel"", is an old Dutch euphemism for the act of love, but that doesn't carry over to English)Circus (English : Circus)Their instrumental music is quite unique style, merging styles like classical chamber, folk, jazz, and everything else they could think of, experimenting with weird combinations of instruments (even using the mouth of the female member as a ""jug"")."
2,Useless if you bought Human Weapon season 1,Amazon sells this dvd as special package with Human Weapon season 1 but actually the season one already contains the episodes about krav maga and usmc martial art .Beside of that if you just want soem of the best episodes of HW get this dvd .Techniques shown are realistic and battle field proven.
3,Human Weopon,Received product in a timely manner. Something wrong with software in my computer. i can not watch this vidio. I will get it fixed later.
3,"Nice, But Too Expensive","Artistically speaking, this watch is wonderful. But I suspect the craftmanship is lacking and that the construction is flimsy. It feels a little like it's about to fall apart in my hand."
3,I found the product descirption very confusing.,"When I ordered the product, the description said that the seed was available in 15 lb. or 30 lbs.When it arrived it was 25 lbs. You need to update your product descriptions."
2,de Grassi with ensemble,"I was fortunate to see the tour for this album, which followed four excellent Windham Hill releases. Unfortunately this music did not capture the same magic for me as his previous albums, whether solo or ensemble, either on the album or in concert. Which is strange because ""Clockwork"" is *the* outstanding ensemble piece from early Windham Hill, and his previous all-solo-guitar album rivalled his marvelous debut for strong music & technique. There are interesting experiments here, like using the ""sympitar"" [guitar with sympathy strings like a sitar], but overall it just didn't add up to repeat play in my stereo."
2,Ambient Music,"I bought this CD because it was highly praised in a book I was reading. It turned out to be a fairly bland ""jazzy, new-age"" guitar oeuvre. Some might like it; good, non-intrusive."
2,"ONLY for wealthy westside: Bev Hills, Bel Air, Santa Monica","I agree with the reviewer from Hermosa Beach. This guide only covers the wealthy westside of LA. How about the rest of LA?There is an entire valley left out called the San Gabriel Valley! The westside of LA distinguishes itself with astronomical prices which shock those of us who live on earth. I speak as one of the few earthlings who live in this part of town.When the guide says that the baby clothes made by Fred Siegel are reasonably priced, that's a definite sign that this guide is only for the affluent and has an altered sense of reasonable prices.The preschool list is helpful, but again, this list ONLY covers the westside of LA. Am I repeating myself here with ""westside only""?"
2,Where's the book for those of us on the eastside???,"I got this book as a gift and while there are some interesting things to do in it...there is almost NOTHING pertaining to anyone who doesn't live in Santa Monica or Beverly Hills. We live in a great community, La Crescenta, and would LOVE to know the preschools around here and parks and great places to shop. Most of the information is outdated now as well. FAO Schwartz is closed...etc."
2,West Side Only,"This book might be fine if you live on the west side. but if you live anywhere east of Beverly Hills I wouldn't bother. If you live in the Valley, forget it."
4,"city baby la, 2nd edition","THis is a great book ! It's a wonderful resource if you live in LA on the west side. I used the first edition when i had my first child, and i now use the 2nd edition with my 3rd child.i love the descriptors of the vendors,and the ease of finding what your looking for since they've narrowed down your search by reccommending their favorites.The kids haircut section i use over and over again."
2,Don't shop at Tiny World in Los Angeles,"OVERALL, THE BOOK HAD SOME GOOD INFO SUCH AS MOMMY AND ME CLASSES AND THE PUMP STATION, ETC. BUT IT SHOULD HAVE HAD A CHAPTER CALLED ""DON'T EVER SHOP AT TINY WORLD"" BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAVE ANYTHING IN STOCK AND THEIR SALESPEOPLE ARE NOT VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE. THEY ARE NOT COMPETENT AT ALL AT INSTALLING CAR SEATS....IF YOU CARE FOR YOUR BABY, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS ""SUPERSTORE"""
3,Color different from one shown,"I checked the blue color for the toilet seat. The seat was shown in blue, which I wanted, but the color sent was lilac. We're going to try to make lilac work in another one of our bathrooms. The quality of the seat seems to be ok. I just felt like if the seat was shown in blue it should have been available in blue."
2,very frustrating,"I find the book extremely frustrating to use primarily because it does not provide step-by-step directions to anything. E.g., the section ""Selecting the Target Server"" (p. 140) shows me the ""Select Target Server"" dialog. BUT HOW DO I GET TO THAT DIALOG? This is typical of the book. The section on the report browser (p. 144) shows me the Report Browser window (Fig 7.6)-but HOW DO I GET TO THAT WINDOW?"
4,A great starter book,"I agree with the concensus reccomendation, this is a primer. Buy this book to get a 10,000 ft view of the data modeling plateu and a short overview of ERwin. It worked perfectly for me as I was a novice to both modeling and the CA tool."
3,for beginner,"For the beginner it's the best choice, not for the advanced project manager or system analyst."
2,Started out loving it but now I miss every shot,"I have had this camera for almost 3 years and at first I just loved it. It's very easy to use - very intuitive and all the buttons, etc. are located in an easy-to-use way. The BIG problem I've had with this camera is that the shutter speed has become slower and slower. Now I miss all the good shots because after pressing the button it takes almost SIX seconds to actually capture the shot. With kids, dogs, or any kind of event, really, it's just impossible to capture a moment as it happens. My poor kids are tired of hearing me say ""Smile and hold it..... hold it.... hold it... hold it... wait....okay there's the picture"" I loved the camera until this happened so I'm upgrading to a new Canon, the IS870."
3,Intelligent introspection,"3 1/2A few epic, tightly wound tracks overshadow the other minor-key experimentations on this bewitching session of angular, acoustic guitar-driven jazz. Some of the uptempo interplay between guitar and drums is nothing short of fascinating (Waterwheel almost sounds like a direct Mice Parade influence), but there are also long segments that drift off into intellectual rambling."
5,Beautiful Album,I gave this as a gift to a close friend so she could get her art photographed and save it in the book as she continues to give paintings away as gifts. She loves it. The leather is of extremely high quality and the ornamentation on the book is not ostentatious and maintains a classic look.
2,Learn good Spanish first,"Most Spanish spoken on the street in the USA is poor quality, like English spoken by high school dropouts (altho' of course educated hispanics here will speak good Spanish). So first learn good Spanish, as taught by various products in Amazon. Pimsleur is a first place to go.This Spanish course is good for law enforcement and others who want to better understand illegals and the worker class in Latin America. However, such people usually will try to speak slowly and otherwise in such a way that you will understand, like you would do with a foreigner."
1,Not that great,"Well...the English speaking is hard to understand, and the phrases to repeat are very long. Not much of a learning tool imo."
2,Looks good but the pendant broke within a few weeks.,This item looked just as described when it arrived. It worried me that the chain seemed cheap so I replaced it with a silver chain I had and was pretty happy with it. But a few weeks later I looked down to see the pearl had come loose from it's stem and there was only a stem hanging from the pendant clasp. So if you only want to wear it for a few weeks this is a good purchase. If you want it to last I would suggest you look elsewhere.
5,Great for those who want to know computers in simplest form,This is definately a must have for anyone seeking to know how their computer works. Learned all I needed to know from this book and others from the same maker.
2,Slow motion--forget about it!,"Attention skaters: if you're buying this DVD because you think you'll be able to examine complex moves beautifully executed in slow motion, forget it! This DVD is encoded so that that ""operation is prohibited."" You can pause it, but that's it. (And no, it's not my DVD player; I have 2 players, both of which can go slow motion through other DVDs, but not with this one.)Moreover, I found the extra features that do exist, like the on-screen bios, more of an annoyance than an asset. More skating, less talk & fluff, if you please!That said, it might be worth buying for heartthrob Philippe Candeloro's swashbuckler routine.<P..."
4,Spiritually higher? See just how low you may end up...,"Tal Brooke gives an amazing look into Eastern way of ""enlightment"" on the example of his own very well written expirience.Although somewhat longer than his ""Avatar of night"". He will provide a detailed account of trying to deny everything of this world in his Indian quest for spiritual truth and knoweledge of God and himself.At the end finding out to know nothing and exposing his godman guru terrible secret agenda.Anyone interested to go spiritually higher with Eastern path of ""enlightment"" and ""self-realization"" see just how low you may end up.I would recommend it highly for Christians and non-Christians alike however if you don't have enough patience for 400 pages you will be better with ""Avatar of night""."
3,Invasion of the GODMEN is better,"I wanted to read this book because I saw Tal Brooks on TV once as he explained his ""enlightening"" during his time in india and I wanted to learn more about his experiences.I never finished reading the book, however, because I had to keep stopping to look-up his words in a dictionary to figure out what he was saying and finally I just put it aside. For me, It just wasn't an enjoyable book to read. His choice of words simply made it hard to read for an average reader like myself.I can't say that there's anythng wrong with the information in the book or that Hartford Graduates wouldn't give it ""Rave reviews"" but just I wish that he would have done what Dr Walter Martin used to say....""Get the hay down from the loft..where the cows can get it""I also saw Tal Brooks in Jeremiah Film's DVD ""Invasion of The GODMEN"" (In their ""Pagan Invasion"" series) which was much easier to follow than this book was and I highly recommend it even though it is a bit ""dated"" now too."
1,Never Read This Book!,"I have all the respect for Tal Brooke for his style of writing. And frankly he writes in such a way that you cannot stop reading his book once you have started it! But having said this,I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is striving to go higher in life and realise himself. Never, never read it. It does mislead a lot of people who are striving hard to go higher in spiritual path. I wouldn't have given even one star as a rating to this book, but I had to give it atleast that to post this review of mine!"
2,commercial or mystery?,I love all of the Alex cross books and this one.... for the most part is pretty much like the rest. That is after the fact that you know everything and anything about the mercedes r350 in this book. I deal with commercials in everything else in life. I read or listen to books so I do not have to deal with that. I think James Patterson may have crossed that line where the money means a lil more then the story. This will be the last Cross book I read.... There are authors out there that still love to tell the story.
3,A little bloody.,Can't patterson give us a good mistry about some murderer who just kills his victims without all that gore. I finished it so for me it must have been good.
2,disappointing,Far from being the best book from James Patterson. One murder every two pages and the invicible hero kills the bad guy at the end.Patterson is running out of steam.
1,CROSS,I RECEIVED THIS BOOK WITH 50 PAGES MISSING AND MANY OTHER PAGES STUCK TOGETHER. I COULD NOT READ THIS BOOK.
3,Mercedes commercial?,"Good villain, good mystery, too much family.As always with Patterson the mystery and action of the book was entertaining and made for an enjoyable read. I wish he would ditch the obligatory chapters about his family and Alex's love live. We get it Nana is old, Alex misses his wife, his kids are perfect and Alex's love interest will be injured or killed and leave. This book also went overboard with the mentioning of the Mercedes R350."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I wanted to read the book before the movie came out. I started reading it and realized so many facts were missing. Also, the story was hard to follow when the facts were straight. That is when I also realized this was the first book and I should have read the other books before reading this one. It was an easy read."
4,Cross is Superb,"I loved it, action from beginning to end.My kind of page turner. The story line pulls you in and keeps you on the edge of your seat."
4,Very Good Book,"I am a fan of Alex Cross, his books are easy to read not a lot of sex.I usually like all of James Patterson's bookds they have a good story line and are very entertaining"
4,Patterson,I highly recommend this book. I have always loves Mr. Patterson's books. This was no exception! Excellent book. Keep them coming.
5,Cross,"I loved this book, even had trouble putting it down. Just like the other books in this series it keeps you on the edge of your seat. I really recomend you read every book in the series. James Patterson is a great aurthor."
4,Another Cross story,"This was a good book but they're getting to be predictable. C'mon Jimmy-boy, get your thinking cap on again and give us something with a smashing ending!"
3,Not a waste of time but..........,"I've been reading Patterson/Cross novels for years now. You know a book is good when you can't put it down. Let's just say that I started this book last summer. I had to bribe myself, with another book, just to make it to the end. I'm disappointed and reluctant to continue the series.I'm sorry I can't suggest this book."
2,Campy Cross,"I am a fan of James Patterson. And I am particularly a fan of Alex Cross. I have read all of his Cross books and despite my disappointment in this book, from continuity issues to campy movie cross references. I reached a point at which I said enough already, give me the money shot and stop torturing me. This was the Alex Cross book for the initiated, we already know the history of the Dragon Slayer. So you can jump right into the water. Short chapters make it easy to turn pages. But, once you got your feet wet, you realize you should have rolled up your pant legs first. It was free money I am sure JP knew it. Probably ghost written. And still I will read Double Cross. Not out of any adolescent respect or honor. Mostly out of habbit. And like cigarettes, a habit I should probably break."
1,"Terrible, absolutely terrible","I'm half way through this and I'm scanning like crazy. Can't wait for it to be over! No wonder Patterson's chapters are only 2 pages long -- there's no substance, the story is fragmented - totally lacks cohesion.Didn't care for some of his others either -- cookie cutter templates that lack credibility and substance. I think Patterson is way past his prime for writing now."
3,Story was wonderful but the ending seemed an afterthought,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I have all the other JP / Alex Cross Novels. I almost could not put it down. But when I got to the end it was almost as if someone else had written it. It seemed like the author had something else to do and just threw in a conclusion. How disappointing for such a wonderful, thrilling novel."
3,Over the top,"Over the top in a few too many ways. I've read others in the series and don't think I struggled with that so much. Don't get me wrong, love the style, couldn't put it down, but it seemed all too formulaic. Maybe it's me, are there really good guys and bad guys like this? Can you have such a horrific killer and leave so much about him out? Like how'd he explain to his unknowing wife why his kids and car got shot up in the ballpark that day. I would've loved to have him deal with that!It's my kind of read and , like I said, I couldn't put it down and I'm likely to read the next one."
3,Average,"The writing style was not what I expected, but the writer caused enough intrigue to keep me turning the pages."
1,"Mr. Patterson ~ After Cross, no more.....","Rather than go into a long lengthy review, I will try to be short and ""sweet"". I agree with all of the 1 star reviews here, they all are 100% correct. I am so disappointed in Patterson for writing such tripe that I have made up my mind to go on to other authors who deserve to be read and I have now given up on Patterson. One last word....a movie based on this book has just been released....one that I certainly will not waste money on...."
3,Great read,James Patterson does it again. Couldn't put it down. The Alex Cross series are great and so are the Michial Bennett series as well. I hope he continues to write them.
3,GLAD I DIDN'T BUY THE BOOK!,"GLAD I DIDN'T BUY THE BOOK! CROSS was a good read for me - a masterpiece - UNTIL page 340, when James Patterson's character Alex Cross speaks of Bill Clinton in the same sentence with ""empathy and compassion."" Touting Clinton's autobiography - was Patterson paid to do this(?)! I was stunned; felt cheated and wished I had not wasted my time reading Patterson's book. Patterson and fictional Cross are probably the only duo in the world who believe Clinton is capable of telling the truth about anything. At a tender moment in CROSS, to all of a sudden endorse Bill Clinton's book was a tawdry, not so sublime political cheap shot and a virtual slap in the face to ALL Patterson and Cross fans - regardless of his/her political persuasion. Very disappointed."
2,"Not a horrible book, but the worst James Patterson I have read so far!","I am a HUGE James Patterson fan and have read most of his books. This is by far the worst James Patterson book I have read so far. It is all over the place and you keep reading because you keep waiting for something to happen but it never does. It is very very predictable and not nearly as exciting as his other books. I would NOT recommend you waste your time with this book but maybe read some of his others such as The Honeymoon, Beach Road, Beachhouse, Lifegaurd, Kiss the Girls, or The Quickie. (there are obviously more that I have not mentioned here) The point it, this particular book is not worth reading."
4,Wonderful!,"James Patterson ""done good."" Typical Alex Cross book. Strong characters, good story line, interesting. Makes for good reading. I feel I got my moneys worth. This book left me waiting for the next one in the series."
5,Great Vacation Read,Book was easy and was hard to put down...great for taking on a airplane or long car ride.
4,Alex Cross by James Patterson,"Another good read from James Patterson. Alex Cross keeps me guessing and that is always one of the best parts of the work, plus he is so human in his emotions he almost comes off the page as real."
4,Alex 1,"I don't quite know what to say. There were so many twist and turns in this story. ""The Butcher"" is a characther I hope to never meet up with. Right now I can't imagine the literary genius of James Patterson and all of the different pictures he paints."
3,"Not his best, but not his worst!","I am a Patterson junkie, and I have read almost all of his books. The only ones that I have not read are the ones that were so bad I could not finish. I thought this was an interesting read, read in the car on 7 hour trip. If you are a Patterson fan you will like getting the history on Maria Cross. Killer in this novel seems alot more tame than some of his others."
3,In the middle fo the Cross-hairs,"I have read most of the entire collection of books with Cross and found this one smack in the middle of his writing. While the story finally brought to an end the death of his wife, the rest of the storyline didn't fare up to the others. I did complete this on one flight , as usual, so it was decent enough to keep me reading. But it lacked the flavor and strength of the others.The new characters were well defined and believable, but some of the actions by Cross and his family had me wondering why I believed them as characters before. It seems the kids are just too good to be true.So put this one right in the middle of your reading aim. Not something to pass up and not something to read first. In the middle of the Cross-hairs."
1,Wow!,"Wow! That's all I can say. This book is the worst thing I have ever read. First of all, it is written on a third grade level. Little words, large type, 2 page chapters - just like my son's reading books!Second, even for a fictional piece, the story is totally unbelieveable. This guy goes around killing people and nobody seems to notice. He kills two people in a hotel, he kills a person in a busy city square, he has a shootout with two thugs on a baseball field and nobody see or hears anything? And, he seems to be the only competent ""bad guy"" in the book. Everybody else makes a mistake and they get killed. It's like watching Die Hard. The bad guy shoots a hundred times and misses and the good guy shoots once and kills five. Was I reading the script for the next Austin Powers movie??? There might be more but I could only get through half the book before I got sick of reading it. I kept reading and reading hoping that it would get better but it just got more and more ridiculous."
3,"Format book, I'm afraid.","In this book, while chasing a serial killer and helping a battered woman deal with her abusive cop boyfriend, Cross finally gets the chance to go after the man that killed his wife years ago. Sounds good but the writing lacks punch. Patterson needs to take a break from this series for a bit as it has grown stale."
2,Skip It,First book in the Alex Cross series I had no problem putting down. This one just didn't grab my attention like other Patterson books.
2,"""Alex is fun, the Book isn't""","Having lived in the DC area I enjoy Alex Cross and his working environment.But I feel this book is disappointing. In general I do not care for Patterson, though I thought ""Mary, Mary"" was quite good.."
1,terrible!,"This is the worst book I have ever read! I read Kiss the Girls years ago, but not enough to remember if it was good or not. With reading all the success that J Patterson has had, I thought he must be great!I was so, so wrong. The book was boring, flat and all over the place. Most of the book is just scattered and random, jumping from one unimportant point to another. There was so suspense, no thrill. The characters were completely flat, and I found that the backstory was completely missing from some very important parts. How did Cross get another kid? Where did HE come from? That would have been nice to know.And then, it all got worse at the end. Terrible!!! I will never read another Patterson book!"
3,Were we reading the same book?,"I am a HUGE fan of Alex Cross and I was really looking forward to Cross.I wanted a clear and precise explanation of who killed Maria (after all Maria was central in Cross' life and felt very important to me). While this book does take a look at her murder, the whole storyline is entertwined with another killer and in the end, Maria's killer is somewhat of an afterthought in the book. Very disappointing.Also, this book felt so slow to me. Stop and go, stop and go. Not much action except for one scene and Alex felt on slow motion to me. The storyline was convoluted and yes, I have to say it, boring.I know that I seem to be one of the only people reviewing this book negatively, but this one just did not have the ""bite"" of the others."
2,Disappointed,I couldn't wait to pick up this book and starting reading. I kept thinking the story line will get better so I kept reading. The story never did get better and became rather boring. Try again James!
1,Wow... what a waste,"I've never read a James Patterson book before, but the movie looked interesting, so I figured I'd give it a shot. The writing is atrocious, the storyline is just plain ridiculous, and the character development is awful. Needless to say, I slogged through about 50 pages (in large type and second grader sentences) and gave up. And I rarely give up on a book."
2,Boring Book,"Plot is boring, doesn't have a logic sequence. I to love James Paterson but this book is one of the worst. Repetitive, predictable, B.O.R.I.N.G... I could barely finished it. Too much dwelling in the past, very unrealistic moves by Cross. Plain and boring book."
1,don 't read this book unless your ready to be grossed out,I never was warned about all the violence and blood and guts there is nothing mentioned on fhe cover or on the reviews
4,back on track,"Compared to the last several co-authored books, ""Cross"" is better written and has much more depth and complexity. There are some loose ends and inconsistencies, but on a whole, it is a fast paced, engaging novel."
5,Great thriller and a real page-turner,"It's summer and my favorite pastime is sitting on my porch on a warm afternoon, reading. I started this one this morning and read it in one sitting. Wow! Cross has drama, action, and best of all, a nice insight into several characters' minds. I loved it.I was disappointed with Beach Road, but wanted to give Patterson a ""second chance."" I'm glad I did. Now, I am anxious to go back and read all of the ""Cross"" series. I like this character a lot and want to learn more about him.This one would make a great movie, and hopefully, that's where it's headed. I highly recommend this book."
5,James Patterson Crosses the Finish Line once again!,"This was another great read from one of my favorite authors! Patterson nevwer fails to grab you from page one, and he doesn't let up until the final word! I hope he keeps them coming for many years to come!"
1,Subpar effort,"I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and enjoyed the first 5. After that the plots are far fetched, the writing is choppy and I started not to care about the characters. It feels like Mr. Patterson is just cranking out books without regard to the quality of writing. For example - pg 136 in ""Cross"". ""He turned out of the stairwell - and it all went wrong in a hurry!"" Is that even a complete sentence? Also, how many writers use exclamation points in their writing? Maybe I am nit picking. I do like to read some books as ""candy"", but I do expect a certain level of writing even from those types of books. Luckily I started to get Mr. Patterson's books from the library instead of spending my money on them."
4,"At Last, more about Alex Cross!",African American detective Alex Cross returns in search of his wife's killer.
1,why $1 more expensive,I bought the this Cross novel since I am a great fan. I mistakenly bought the Alex Cross version first but it was in Spanish. Returned and bought the English versionWhy is Original English version Priced at $6.99 and the Spanish version $5.99
4,Excellent read,Cross is an excellent read and a lot better than the movie. It is action packed and full of suspense.
4,Cross,"Such a good read it seemed I just began reading and was so drawn in that I didn't realize I was nearing the end. Good cliff hanger, can't wait to start the next one."
3,solid effort,Thsi novel is a solid effort mainly because we get a lot more background about Cross marriage and relationship to his wife Maria but the murderer is pedestrian and the book is rather lame except for the Maria factor
2,A thriller for dummies,"If you are not a very demanding reader and are only looking for some entretainment in a long flight, this book is for you.However, if you appreciate a well-crafted storyline and characters with some psychological depth, look elsewhere. Patterson's style - three page chapters always ending on cliffhangers - gets old very quick and simply does not allow for the type of more elaborate plot that many readers (myself included) are looking for in a crime/thriller novel. Agreed, there is a lot of action, but it's all simply too straightforward, predictable and shallow. This was my first Patterson and I'm not coming back for more."
3,"Like a story from the Lifetime network: sugar-coated, predictable and unimaginative","Honestly, some books should remain unwritten. Patterson isn't bad, it's just that this book isn't one of his best.We have two main characters here: Alex Cross and The Butcher - Michael Sullivan. Cross is the protagonist, yet he fails to win the reader. True, we feel sorry for him. He loses his wife, finds a new friend, loses his friend, tracks a serial rapist/murderer, finds him, fails to kill him, etc. etc. Like Cross's character is plain and I just couldn't connect with him.The antagonist on the other hand is a different story. He is a hired hitman, a butcher with his own priorities. He jumps out of the pages. He is sinister, brutal, yet something about him keeps the book alive, makes it catchy and edgy.I didn't feel Patterson made much effort into this one. It felt more like a story from the Lifetime network, sugar-coated, predictable and unimaginative. I'd say: pass on this one."
2,Dissapointed,"I'm a James Patterson fan, I've read every Alex Cross book thus far. This has to be the worst. The plot, the characters, I just was not really feeling it at all. The storyline was weak, especially with The Butcher..the ending was super predictable. I say the next book let Kyle Craig finally escape from his padded cell and bring on the action....I could have skipped this book all together!"
1,"Not good, ending very weak!","James Patterson is overrated. The ending of the book is so weak and like someone else already said, very predictable. I prefer other writers with more depth and knowledge."
3,Just did not enjoy this one...,"I really love reading James Patterson books, but the Alex Cross series just does not keep me interested."
2,Pretty disappointed,"I am a huge James Patterson fan and have thoroughly enjoyed just about everything he has written. So it was with great excitement that I waited for this book. It was a huge disappointment. The suspense and plot twists we've come to expect were not there, and there was way way too much graphic violence for my taste."
3,I was disappointed,"I have been a fan of James Patterson for over 15 years; I have read all of his books and have enjoyed every Alex Cross series. However this one was a total disappointment. It should have been the best because after all these years of wondering who killed Maria and why, instead I get a lame story line involving the mafia and some crooked cops, including John Sampson. I was shattered and mad because the ending was so stupid! Yes stupid.I'm sorry, but I was totally disappointed with this book, hopefully your next book will be a worthwhile read."
1,A real yawner,"This is my first and probably last Patterson novel. For all the books he has writen, I thought he would be a clever, witty author. I found the character to be very shallow and the plot line, while gruesome, very predictable and trite. Give me Vince Flynn, David Rosenberg, Nelson DeMille, Lee child or the Tom Clancy (Pre-Red Rabbit) novels any day.What am I missing that everybody else sees in this author?"
1,Patterson lining his pockets,Why would someone publish the same story under rwo different names. Someone spent money to buy me a book that I already had under a different title.
1,Wow that was bad,I kept reading hoping it would get better and it did not. I was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of a strong plot and poorly written text. It is hard to read a book that half of the sentences end in question marks
3,I have almost all of them,"The only thing that is lacking is that in the beginning the author does not explain where his son Alex Jr. (Ali) comes from. It is an easy read and keeps you turning the pages. Also, chapter 23 and 24 are listed in Kindle as chapter 234. It reads ok, though."
3,cross,I am not a fan of brutality for the sake of brutality. I had a hard time reading this book. It was chosen by my book club or I would not have finished it. Wouldn't recommend it to my friends.
3,Patterson was better,"I like Patterson's Cross books - but this is not among the best of them. We are being dragged around in what seems a semi-purposeless tour. The story takes a while to evolve, and suddenly, it is over"
5,book,big alex cross fan can't wait to read it been reading him forever love it never want book to end
5,JP does it again. :),"One great feature about Cross is that you do not have to read the other books in the series to enjoy the story. As usual, JP creates so much suspense and excitement you are finished before you know it and cannot wait for the next one to be released.In Cross, you learn about Alex Cross and what happens to his first wife, Maria, which in turn allows you to understand the evolution of his life. In addition, you meet Michael Sullivan, one of the worst antagonists in Alex Cross's life.Other than feeling slight disappointment when finding out what happened to Maria's killer (because I felt it was just thrown into the story for closure), Cross is an electrifying tale."
1,Cross,"I was curious to listen to this, my first book on a Playaway, an iPod type listening device of a single novel. This was cool! 7.5 hrs continuous, stopping starting at any point. I stuck with this story to the end and am so mad at myself for the totally waste of time. The content is brutal, not exciting or suspensful. The writing is cliche filled, name dropping to appear contemporary and stupidly improbable! I'm annoyed at authors who write just to fill pages, ensnareing readers (listeners) with nonsense. Don't even want to dwell on a review other than to advise, skip it!"
3,This book fell flat.,"I love the Alex Cross series of books, so I had high hopes for ""Cross"". I was disappointed. There wasn't the usual fire in Alex, and it felt like all of the other characters (Sampson, Nana Mama, the kids) were just sitting in the background. And where was the last-minute plot twist that leaves your mouth hanging open in shock?? The story was pretty good, and it was interesting to hear about Maria's death, but that was all this book had going for it."
2,Product Placement???,"I dont think I have ever read a book with more positive references to commercial products. He must have received a nice bundle of cash from Mercedes, Duncan Donuts, Au Bon Pain, etc... Patterson spends just a little too much time discussing the positive attributes of the Mercedes that Cross purchased.Overall, the book was ok. Quick read, but the ending was predictable. Not the best Alix Cross book by any means."
4,Hmmmmmmm,"I have had the thrill of reading most of the Alex Cross series and am now hooked on the ""Maximum Ride"" Series. Although this story is a good one, there is still something lacking, but I can't put my finger on it. Cross is faced with the opportunity to avenge his wife, Maria's killing. And that comes about in 1/8 of the maze of a story. The ""Butcher"" is a very interesting serial killer/rapist, but it just doesn't have the spark that other Alex Cross novels had for me. Still a fun read though."
5,Writing the way He used too.,"Finally, Patterson is back to writing the way he used too. This is a Cross story that I simply couldn't put down. The writing is clean and fairly well thought out, with almost no holes in the story line."
4,Finally!,"I have read most of James Pattersons's books, including all of the Alex Cross series. This is the first Alex Cross book I've read in a very long time that I really enjoyed. As much as I love James Patterson, I feel like quality has been suffering to quantity in the last few years. Like, his earlier books, Along Came a Spider and Jack and Jill, Mr. Patterson has finally redeemed himself and gave Alex Cross fans, like myself a book we could not put down. Long live Alex Cross!"
4,Good book,"The book was good. I could have done without a few 'iffy' parts, but it was all in all a good read."
1,A huge disappointment,"I've been reading Patterson for years, and this doesn't even sound like his writing. What it DOES feel like is a contract-obligation book. Alex Cross deserves better. The writing is choppy, the plot jerky, and the dialogue sentimental. I also resent ending such as this one has where there is an obvious set-up for the next book.There won't BE a next book for me."
5,Cross by James Patterson,"One of Patterson's best! Thrilling, spell-binding, action oriented; great character development. I became completely absorbed in the story and couldn't wait to find out what happens next. I read the book in two days. The plot was calculating, typical of James Patterson, and his writing style developed it exquisitely. For action-packed mystery thrillers ""Cross"" is right up at the top of the list."
5,Cross,I love to read aqbout Alex Cross Can't wait to read the next story about Alex From the beginning until now the stories are hard to put down.
2,First disappointment,"I've read every James Patterson book written and sadly, this one was a disappointment. For first time JP readers, do not let this book stop you from reading his other thrillers. Maybe it's time for JP to slow down in publishing so many books a year and take the time to really put his heart back into his writing. However, I'm already waiting for his next one."
2,Haven't I read this before?,"I wanna start by saying that I am a diehard fan of Patterson, especially the Alex Cross series. This book however, seemed a little vanilla. I liked the potential it had with Alex searching for his wife's killer. I liked the ""Butcher of Sligo"" as the featured serial killer. I did not like the flow this book took. It seemed kind of confused as to where it wanted to go. The revenge or closure for Maria's killing still doesn't feel like it happened. I'm used to being shocked at some point reading one of Mr. Patterson's stories, and this one didn't do that for me. Was it a quick read? Yes. Was it one of my favorites? No"
3,Less and Less Memorable,I just read the book like 2 weeks ago and already I've forgotten what happened. There was just so much potential... with Alex finally getting to know who killed his wife and Patterson just disappointed.
4,Not his best,"I was disappointed that Mr. Patterson chose not to tell us, his faitful readers, more about his wife and their life together prior to her murder."
1,Save your money,"Once again it's been confirmed: I am smarter than the general public. If this book is #1, then how smart can the reading public be? But then again, I bought it and read it, so maybe...."
1,Cross,"I gave this product zero stars as it was written in Spanish. It did not indicate that this was a Spanish version of the book. Since I don't speak or write Spanish, this book was useless."
1,"No more, please ....",I hope someone kills Alex Cross soon .... Patterson is only reusing a successful name for a lousy story.
3,A little disappointed,"I was expecting more of this one. It was a page-turner, but it did not have the suspense I was expecting and therefore this disappointment. Excellent book, just not what I was expecting for the other Alex Cross novels I had read."
3,If I paid money for this book - I would be upset,"This book was better than most of the more recent Alex Cross series but not up to the level of the first three. There was no suspense, no thrill. The most disappointing was the ending which seemed like the author had something else to do and just threw in a conclusion.You have to keep your disbelieve very active for things such as why - did rape victims report the crime if they were going to refuse to describe the assailant - Kayla in serious condition was still in the emergency room when Alex arrived - the villain did not explain to his unknowing wife why his kids and car got shot up in the ballpark that day - Sampson waited more than 10 years to tell Alex about Maria's real killer - Alex Cross was not in trouble when he violated the therapist/patient confidentiality - the villain cut the faces of his victims - did the villain let victims live after showing them pictures of his previous murders - etc. etc."
4,oh how i love mazon.......,i have never has any problems with my book orders. they have always been quick at shipping and always are in touch with me the whole time.thanks amazon
2,Does He have a slicing complex?,"I didn't want to listen to this audio book, but my husband did. I think we could have stopped short by at least two or three, mutilations of the women he raped. We get it, we get it! The butcher is evil incarnate, with a scalpel in his hand. One of the latest Lindsey Boxer books had this theme of slicing faces, too. What's up Mr. Patterson? No other stories to tell??? I love how in all his books, whether it is Cross or Boxer, they always are meeting the most evil, vile human life form they have ever seen before, in each novel. I hate gratuitous violence. Tell a story, for crying out loud. Subtle is good. Bludgeoning the reader is Bad."
3,Expecting More!,"I was expecting more of this one. It was a page-turner, but it did not have the suspense I was expecting and therefore this disappointment. Excellent book, just not what I was expecting for the other Alex Cross novels I had read.This is not the Alex Cross that I have enjoyed at the beginning of the series. Cross must have had a head injury because the character just seems to babble along without any intelligible analysis or interpretation of what is happening around him. And then there was this plot twist between Cross and Sampson that I'm still having trouble understanding.I was expecting more from this novel. Still it was a page-turner, to a limited degree, because there was little suspense and this caused a big disappointment with me.It`s not a terrible book, it just didn't measure up to the other Cross stories that I have enjoyed."
2,Disappointing,Patterson more recent books are not as good as the older ones. They seem to be written in child-like language. Very disappoionted. I have read all his books.
3,Not his best book,"I have read every Alex Cross book that James Patterson has written, as well as all his other books. Cross is not one of his best, a bit too wordy, and a bit slow, but if you love everything Alex Cross, you'll enjoy this book."
4,Recreating the new you!,"Dale does a great job using the book of Ruth to show us there is always Hope in your life when you surrender your life completely to God, and let Him show you your unique second calling!"
1,"Book - ""Second Calling""","No problem executing the order and the book delivery was timely. However, the lower edge of the hard cover was very badly frayed. It was for personal use so we can live with it but I would never pass it on as a gift."
5,love them,"I've been using this brand for years. I really get a lot of mileage out of a pair by reusing them. If they start to get dirty, I put them in the pocket of some Levis or similar and run them through the wash (warm/cold) and then dry them inside the pants as well. They come out nice and clean and fluffy :-)"
5,These are the best,"Simple but excellent ear plugs. My brother got me to try these years ago and I've been using them ever since. We both buy them by the boxful. Living in a noisy city, I think I would have lost my mind on many occasions without em. If you haven't used ear plugs before, it does take a little getting used to but then you get over it. Just make sure you get them in right. The trick is to roll it down slowly and get it as narrow as possible (think matchstick) and then insert it quick. I hold it for a few seconds to let it expand. If it's not in right, you'll know it. Just take it out and start over. I know it sounds like a lot of trouble, but it really isn't at all once you get good at it. Oh, and if you have short ear canals, you can cut one in half like my sister in law does."
2,It does not work,"I have allergies and did feel any difference. A physician told me, these product don't help. It is back into its box and put aside. Very unhappy."
5,A+++ Amazing product and super fast shipping with super saver shipping!,"This product was more than I could have expected for the price! I have several other air purifiers and paid A LOT MORE and yet this is the best one by far! It keeps the entire basement smelling fresh! Which I thought would be impossible - that's why i didn't want to spend a lot, but now I know that the more something cost does not necessarily mean the better it is...this is best unit I have and for the least amount. And with the super saver shipping it still arrived FAST! LOVE IT!"
3,Louder than I would've thought..,I recently purchased the Hamilton Beach 04161 purifier and was very happy with my deal. When this purifier came on sale I bought one for my brother's room and it was way larger and way louder than mine. Space is limited in his room so I was a bit disappointed. The purifier does it job okay though.
3,Noisy,"Although this air cleaner is filtering the air in our family room, it is noisy (even on the lowest speed) and it throws out air (through the top vent) that ""hits you"" as you walk by. I don't think I would purchase this unit again - at least, not for a room where hearing conversation, music, or the tv is important."
5,Integral Consciousness,This is an excellent documentry. I was looking for a starting place to learn about Aurobindo and his work--this DVD delivers. It's informative and professionally done by someone who respects the people and the subject matter.
4,Mary and Rhoda,"I liked this DVD. If you are expecting something like the good ol' Mary Tyler Moore show, you will be disappointed, perhaps. But if you feel like Mary and Rhoda are old friends and you would like to ""see"" what they are doing now, and how their lives might have gone on, you will enjoy this. It was sweet and pretty good, but nowhere near as funny as the old MTM shows. Probably wasn't written by the same people. Both actresses look amazing and it was kinda cool to see them again. Haven't really seen either of them in TV or movies in the past years. Recommend this for die hard fans but watching it once might be all you need."
1,It's great to see Mary and Rhoda back together again,Its great to see Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) and Rhoda Morgenstern (Valerie Harper) back together again and to see Rhoda get her spirit back like she was in The Mary Tyler Moore show where she was confident and full of wisecracks not like she was when she had her own series Rhoda and after she got married to Joe and became insecure. It was a lot of fun and great memories of how close these characters and actress really are. Please Please FOX Bring out the remaining seasons of the Mary Tyler Moore show to DVD.
1,Not a bad transfer,Mtm looks younger now than she did when she made this.As bad as everyone says it is. Worth seeing however for thecar crash effect.
3,"Fun, but could have been better",Being a huge fan of the MTM show I just had to get this. The problem is not the actors. The problem is the script. I still enjoyed seeing Mary and Rhoda back together. At least you get a chance to see what has happened in their lives.
5,MARY AND RHODA,"HELLO MY NAME IS ANNE,I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE, I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT, AND I GIVE IT5 STARS, IT WAS GREAT SEEING BOTH TOGETHER, THIS ONE MY KIND OF MOVIE."
5,benefits of hawthorn berry,"I have been using hawthorn berry extract for nearly one month. I was most interested in potential of this supplement to help maintain normal blood pressure. I am presently monitoring my blood pressure daily and have been pleased with the results so far. An unexpected ""side effect"" was the disappearance of my joint pain! I had developed significant arthritis pain and stiffness in my left hand and elbow, and it had begun to limit my movement. Since using the hawthorn berry extract, the pain has literally disappeared and I longer need to take daily OTC drugs for relief. The only ""down side"" is that hawthorn acts as a diuretic, so you may need to visit the restroom more often. But the diuretic properties of hawthorn are part of its effectiveness in helping maintain blood pressure. Don't miss daily doses and be patient. This has really worked for me."
4,"Ummm, this is the review for part 1, not part 2 (which theyt","I liked this single a bit. We're in this together is a great song, and the Quiet version of The Day the World Went Away is better than the original in my opinion. But one of the previous reviewers comments about the Porter Ricks mix of TDTWWA is right... its a joke, a crappy song. I'd recommend this to a big NIN fan. i wish they put all 3 on one 9 track cd... i also dont see why they put so much TDTWWA on this single. i believe that should have gone on Halo 13 (and the quiet version is there)."
4,Great movie,"I bought this DVD since I had seen Point Pleasant a few weeks ago and really loved the series, wish it would have gone on longer, this is such a good film, really enjoyable, good twists and acting."
1,BOO!,"..And not in a ghostly good way. This movie was probably the most horrible movie I've had the ""privilege"" of seeing this summer. It was obviously constructed by the Blair Witch people who took on a fail attempt here at a cabin on the lake. Yawn. It's been done before, and should have stopped while it was ahead. I sat there for the first 45 minutes waiting for this movie to get good, and to pick up for that matter. And that last half was just awful. No scares, nothing. All you see here (spoiler) is a bunch of black goop coming out of drains, and teenage adolescent nonsense. Please do not be fooled. It's apparent that the cast and crew are throwing in their ""good reviews"" to keep the ratings up for it on Amazon to merely deceive you into purchasing it. I repeat, this movie is awful and should have never even been released. We need more alien movies. Movies like this are just getting extremely OLD and UNORIGINAL. Even Amazon prices it CHEAP! Gee, I wonder why."
4,I'd Really To See You Tonight,"Hi, This album is a very good album. And a good price. The songs are good to listen to."
3,"Imperfect, but Good","This CD has 5 great songs on it, of which each were huge hits, and for good reason (I'd Really Love to See You Tonight, Nights Are Forever Without You, It's Sad to Belong, We'll Never Have to Say Goodbye Again, and Love is the Answer). There are two more ""Okay"" songs: What Can I Do With This Broken Heart and Westward Wind, and then there are three bland, not very great at all songs: Gone Too Far, You Can't Dance, and Hold Me. But the worse part of this CD is that Just Tell Me You Love Me was missing, as it is also missing from ED&JFC's Very Best of CD. This is a song that has over half a million hits on youtube and was a huge hit when it came out in 1980. Therefore, this CD could have been a really great CD if the three bad songs had been omitted and Just Tell Me You Love Me had been included."
5,Great CD,"Great songs from the era I grew up in, brings back memories.Back when music was good and easy listening.Makes you want to sing along."
3,I'd really love to see you,Has most of the classic England Dan and John Ford Coley songs. Great CD for memories.
3,Verrismo,An average performance of an interesting verrismo opera. The performers are average good and the recorded sound is OK. This is a recording for the serious student of Italian opera not for the average listening public.
3,mislead by other reviews,"When I watch a movie set in Thailand, I like to see some of the beautiful country. That was largely absent, most of the action taking place in the big city. It's a movie about a nerd that visits his jerk brother, who is abusing his relationships with his family, his university employer, and everyone else that comes near him. Using favorable exchange rates, he is able to let his self-centered tendencies blossom.His brother visits, either to try to get the jerk to come home, or maybe just to cure his own blues.I hoped to see a cinematic movie with a good story. This is a story of a jerk and the awakening of his depressed brother. The awakening is well-done, in that he wakes up to both good and bad elements of life.As the other review said, the acting is good. If that's the kind of story you like, you might try this one. If you want to see something more pleasant, and more visually beautiful, then look elsewhere."
2,The Elephant King,"DVD arrived in good time but as the movie is an American movie and some sections are in the Thai Language, it was impossible to follow as there were no subtitles in English for the Thai language sections.Which means whole sections of the movie were unintelligible."
4,"Solid collection, Great for new fans","four and 1/2 stars. I love this band and grew up listening to Shadowdance. No other band sounds like this band. You would never confuse Shadowfax with anyone else, they are that distinctive. It's a whole new headspace. Chuck's death in 1995 was heartbreaking to me as I was hoping to see them play live but never got the chance. This is a solid collection with great tracks from their earlier work. As the previous reviewer noted, it does not contain important material from their later releases (this album used to be called ""Shadowfax A Windham Hill Retrospective"") but even so all the tracks on it are solid. If you like this I'd recommend picking up Shadowdance and The Dreams of Children."
4,Lost family classic.,"Escapade In Japan is a good family adventure about an American boy (Jon Provost, who played Timmy Martin on Lassie) who survives a plane crash in the sea of Japan. He's picked up by a fishing boat, and afraid he'll be blamed for the plane crash and turned over to police, he runs away with the help of the fisherman's boy. Together they flee across Japan, and one of the movie's strengths is the exploration of many facets of Japanese country and culture - in color - rare in a film of the 1950s. Meanwhile the boy's parents, Teresa Wright and Cameron Mitchell, frantically search for him. Clint Eastwood has a bit part, one of his first."
2,what a disappointment,"based on all the other reviews for this book, i was really looking forward to reading this. when i got finished reading this all i could ask myself was ""this can't be all there is?"" the writer makes things way more complicated then they need to be, and there isn't anything earth shattering included. the basic stuff, he makes sound so complicated that you need to be a rocket scientist to figure out what he's talking about. this book contains information for the intermediate bowler, but he or she better have an iq of 200 to figure it out.save yourself some money, go bowl a few games and actually work on things that you need to fix. you know what they are. it will be a better use of your time and money."
5,RIGHT IN THE NUTS,"NIGHT IN THE RUTS is a fantastic 1979 album that was the last album made before the departure of lead gutarist Joe Perry and rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford. The album explodes into 'No Surprize' a personal favourite of Steven Tyler. Another great track 'Chesecake' features a great riffs and solo parts on guitar. 'Think about it' is a great track and my personal favourite on this album, fast riffs and great vocals - sums up the album - This is a must have album for any Aerosmith or rock fan!this is a lost gem in AEROSMITH'S catologue."
5,The Band's Most Overlooked Disc,"The album that broke the band. This album turned out to be the swan song for Brad Whitford and Joe Perry who both left after this album and tour. The band was in the throws of full scale drug and alcohol addiction by this time. Surprisingly the album is quite good; in fact I think it is their most underrated disc. The band goes back to their blues roots with killer versions of ""Walking In The Sand"" and ""Refer Head Woman"". The opening track ""No Surprise"" tells the story of the bands history and reminds me Boston's ""Rock n Roll Band"" with a similar theme. Other standout tracks include ""Bone to Bone (Coney Island Whitefish Boy)"" and the power ballad ""Mia"" about Tyler's daughter. ""Three Mile Smile"" is also a good one. Joe Perry plays some outstanding guitar on this disc as well. Personally I rank this up with the best in the band's catalogue."
5,5 stars oh yeah!,"I LOVE THIS CD!!!! its a real bluesy one and these songs just get stuck in your head and you cant get them out...i believe we call this an ""ear worm""...this whole cd is an ""ear worm""! its great i love ""reefer headed woman"" steve plays his harmonica in most of the songs and they all have this bluesy feel that just makes you wanna tap your heal dance along w/ the music and sway your head from side to side! (but of course we do this w/ every ^A^ song!)"
4,NOOO!!! CHIQUITA!!!,"Hey Aerosmith fans, no, not you, the OLD fans, but you, the NEW fans. By ""new"" I mean everyone who knows Aerosmith from the album Pump forward. That was the album where Aerosmith cemented their comeback, and by comeback I mean going to the top of the charts and staying there for years and subsequent albums. The album before had the big hit Dude Look Like a Lady, but also had some nasty rock n roll. What I think is lost on new fans is the fact that the boys had SEVEN excellent albums of hard rocking, nasty, dangerous tunes before they disintegrated as a unit, then released Rock in a Hard Place, and disbanded. Which brings us to this album, Night in the Ruts, which I'm supposed to be writing about! This is a great album. No, it isn't as good as Rocks and Toys and some of the other early classic stuff, but, there are some great tunes on here! IF you like the first few albums, I really think you would like this one too. cheers."
3,Last of the classics,"Not a bad album at all. Not really memorable though. A few great tracks with ""No Surprise"" and the cover of a rare Yardbirds b-side ""Think About It"". The rest is ok but it is clear that the ship was running out of steam at this point."
4,Not one of their best albuns...,"This is not one of the best albuns, but there are some great songs, like ""No Surprize"", ""Think About It"" and ""Mia"" (which Tyler wrote for his daughter).It's a ""must have"" for every fan of the band."
3,Not bad at all,"I have read so much reviews that this album doesn't give a s**t, so i thought that it must be a bad Aerosmith record. This is what i think: isn't a bad album, but isn't a real good one. The best song is ""No Surprize"" 'cause talks about Aerosmith's begining and have a real good notes. ""Remember (walking in the sand)"" a cover from The Shangri La's; and ""Bone to bone"" are really great. The rest of the tracks are simply ok, but not like the real stuff that Aerosmith have done."
5,"Aerosmith's last album, before breaking up","The band got in a fist-fight & broke up, after releasing this album. The fight apparently had something to do with their drug-abuse. This is their last album that has a true garage-door band nitty-gritty sound. A few years later, when the band reconciled their differences & got back together, their music had changed & had become main-stream classic-rock. What can I say? Fame & fortune always spoils a good thing?"
4,"The last ""real"" Aerosmith album.","For us longtime Aerosmith fans this album marks the end of an era. Not because Joe Perry left during the recording of this disc but because it marked the end of Aerosmith as a true blues based hard rock band. No album that has followed this rocks as hard or has that true Aerosmith feel. From the bluesy Reefer Headed Woman to the raunchy Cheesecake this album is Aerosmith at their down and dirty finest. My favorite track is the underated Chiquita which should have been the single, not the rehash of the Shangra-La's (sp?) Remember(Walkin' in the Sand). Other album highlights include Bone to Bone, Think About It and Mia (a true rock ballad that puts their later putrid ballads to shame).If your a new A-Smith fan get Rocks, Toys in the Attic, Get Your Wings and this one and find a great American rock and roll band at their peak. Not the sanitized , corporate sell-outs that they have become."
4,Great Guitar Riffs!,"Dog it all you may, but this album has some of the greatest Aerosmith riffs ever made! I love every song on here, especially the funky ""Three Mile Smile"" (immediately followed by one of their best straight blues songs ever), the Zep-like slide-work of ""Cheese Cake"" and pure rock of ""Bone to Bone"". ""Remember"" is a great cover, and the guitar/horn riff in ""Chiquita"" always gets me going... A true lasting classic, just like the band."
5,Underrated!,"""Three mile smile"" and ""Chiquita"" alone are worth it. I also think that sonically it's Aerosmith's best. Such a good, solid rock and roll record!"
4,Aerosmith - 'Night In The Ruts' (Sony),"Originally released in 1979,this was Aerosmith's sixth album.I haven't heard this CD in SO long,I sort of forgot how much I have always enjoyed it.True,it was the last lp before guitarist Joe Perry had left to form his own band,The Joe Perry Project.Still,this effort kicks total ass,at least I thought so.Tracks that make this disc a keeper are the rocking opener ""No Surprize"",""Reefer Head Woman""(good harmonica playing,there Steven),""Bone To Bone"" and their two covers,the Shangri-Las smash mid-'60's hit ""Remember(Walking In The Sand)"" and the Yardbird's ""Think About It"".Good '70's hard rock title to listen to late on the weekends.A should-have."
5,Right Where It Hurts - Or Does It?,"""Switch the first two letters of the title around to get our basic philosophy of rock n' roll!"" This from Steven Tyler, their AMAZING lead singer. But this album is far from painful. One of the most beautiful songs Steven ever wrote closes out this album, and it's even more heartwarming because he wrote it for his daughter, Mia. That is so sweet! Aside from the song Steven wrote for his daughter, there a lot of real rockers on this album, and their cover of the Shangri-Las hit ""Remeber(Walking In The Sand)"" was tailor made for their harmonies. ""Bone To Bone (Coney Island White Fish Boy)"" is one of those rockers you just have to crank up when you hear it on the radio. This is a must have for any Aerosmith fan who loves the vintage stuff - just don't be surprised if your drving companion hollers at you to turn it up."
3,Alright,"This was the record Aerosmith did just before both guitarists quit the band and it shows. Tensions must have been high, as the songwriting doesn't come close to previous works like '75's Toys In The Attic or '76's Rocks. Legend has it that during their 5th record Draw The Line, the band began to go from drug users to drug abusers, which makes me think they were a little more than messed up during the Night In The Ruts sessions. There are a few good tracks, but don't get it unless you're a big Aerosmith fan."
3,this one was a band in trouble with good songs still.,"aerosmiths partying had done a number on the band by this time in 79. At the time fans were not so happy with this one and for good reason , the band was splintering and truly outstanding songs just weren't on this one as compared to what had come before. That being said a weak aerosmith cd is still better than alot of modern rock tracks so it's still a decent cd. The band just didn't have the chops it had displayed earlier and this one unlike previous efforts was not as popular it still sold well at first though. It's got some great songs and lots of blander ones , at least for aerosmith! IT's worth owning though because it is aerosmith and that's good enough for me."
4,Surprisingly strong,"Considering the band was falling apart and as Joe Perry put it, they were drug addicts dabbling as musicians rather than musicians dabbling in drugs, this album is a class act.The state of the band is evident in the cover, but the music is second to none. It starts off with the classic No Surprize, one of Aerosmith's best tracks. There is a tired, ragged, but rich version of Remember Walking In The Sand.The highlight has to be Cheese Cake, with fantastic steel guitar from Joe Perry who left the band during the making of it. Other very strong songs are Bone To Bone, Reefer Headed Woman and a beautiful song called Mia, written by Steven Tyler about his newborn daughter.Tom Hamilton and Joey Krammer are as ever the backbone of Aerosmith and are probably responsible for holding them together during the dark times.Night In The Ruts is highly recommended."
5,They do it again,The team of Jim watt and Dick Talleur have brought us another fine fly tying video. Under the direction of Dick fly tyers will learn how to tie Dicks favorite flys. Dick takes you step by step through each fly so that even a beginner can follow. Each fly is introduced with a recipe then you are showen how to tie each fly. This video is done very well with many differnt camera angels of each fly. I would highly recommend this video to all fly tiers.
4,"very interesting, insights both good and bad on polygamy","Annie Clark Tanner was an admirable person. When I completed reading this book I had a strong desire to call one of her children, if any are still alive. I appreciated the support and understanding she received from her children as they became adults. They had a wonderful mother. I am amazed at all she went through for her husband, without bitterness. However, she was open about her feelings, which let me know that she was ""real"". Thank you Annie, for writing about your life and sharing your experiences."
1,Ineffective at teaching you how to market pharmaceutical products,"I found this book to be fairly useless. It provides good definitions to all the key aspects/elements/entities in the pharmaceutical space but there was little practical material. I was looking for a reference about how to put a marketing plan together and what a pharmaceutical plan would look like and did NOT find it in this book.It was also sparse on pharma specific frameworks. It describes Porter's 5 Forces, the three C's and of course the four P's but you can get that in any marketing/strategy book. There must be something better out there that is better suited to pharma."
3,Good as introduction to pharmaceutical marketing,"The book is a good introduction to pharmaceutical marketing that I can recommend. However, it feels too academic (sometime not really applicable in real life). I also lack the forward-looking aspects of the book; for example, how is a business thinking transforming the industry, what major trends are there."
1,Don't buy from this seller,"I ordered the SNN5696A battery pictured on the listing and they sent me a BR50 battery instead, which is a cheap, poor-quality substitute made in China. When I contacted them about it, they acknowledged that they sent the inferior product as a substitute but refused a refund or exchange. I would not recommend that anyone purchase anything from this seller, they are obviously counting on the fact that the item is too inexpensive to make a big deal about, which is really dishonest behaviour."
2,wrong battery,"I typed in my battery number and this battery came up, and its not the same size battery, for my motorola v325i. not worth the hassle of sending it back to get 3.00 back.. boo"
3,"Great in concept, not so much in practice","This camera works great as-is; however, it's difficult to interface with programs like Gmail, Skype, and AIM. This device is approved for use with Skype, but my output video always had weird yellow streaks and audio ticks. Settings are fixed for these programs and the highest resolution is only available when you want to record a video through the QuickCam softwarette. The QuickCam software caused my RealTek Audio driver to crash and now the audio hardware availability spotty even after System Restore. I do realize this is limited to my system and does not affect my product rating."
3,logitech Quikcan,This product is OK it took a little while to make it work through Skype. The video has a lot of snow for that reason I would rather use a laptop that has a Quickcam built in!
4,Great camera with robust features at low price,"After having a new baby, our friends and family started hounding us to buy a webcam. Being cash strapped (you know, new baby and all), I didn't want to spend a lot.Luckily I got way more than I paid for with this Logitech camera. The image is clear and not too grainy, and the effects are fun. It works quite well for video web chat. Don't expect megapixel clarity, but for what it is designed for, it works well.I installed it on both a Vista machine and XP machine without any problems. It is very refreshing to have drivers for the Vista OS and not have any ill effects from installing peripherals.Couldn't ask for much more."
4,Great cam!,"So far, I love this web cam. It's super compact, easy to install and use. The only thing that I don't really like is the clamp. On my notebook the monitor area is quite slick so its hard to get it to not slip, but once I get it in place it stays. The shipping was super fast as well. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,Great cam for the price,"Great camera, takes a little while to get used to all the settings but no major complaints. My only warning and small negative feedback is that it doesn't work well with Vista. It may just be my computer, but it seems to interfere with the internet in some ways after a couple of days of use but again, THIS IS ONLY WITH VISTA. Overall though it's a great product and highly recommended."
5,Great pictures,"It's not a high-def webcam but it does take in light very well, and always makes the pictures really great. I am pale, so it washes out my skin and looks good (hides blemishes, dark circles). Maybe not the best camera if you don't like looking washed out.It also seems to be pretty sensitive, so handle it carefully. My first one broke after a year because I dropped it several times."
4,"For the price, it is great.","Easy to install, plug and play. Good pic, good video, not the best, but the camera didn't cost hundreds of dollars. For the price it is great."
3,Has a defect,It worked wonderfully initially but now seems to have lost its microphone functioning. ONLY camera working. Pic quality gud.
4,"good cam, not the best though","its a great cam just to use and call your friends with, but its not the greatest quality. Also the mic did not work for me so I have to buy one seperate so im a little upset about that, but other than that I REALLY LIKE IT."
3,Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks is for the basic needs,"I use this web camera with Dell Inspiron E1505 notebook. The quality of the picture is not the best, but it does its job: you can tell the features and shapes of the familiar things and people on the other side of the line. I use it to communicate with friends via Skype. Sometimes there is a stripe of undeveloped color that goes through the middle of the screen. I attribute it to the camera itself because I don't have anything like that happening on my other Logitech web cam that I use with my PC. I paid around $30 for QuickCam. Do not pay more for it."
5,Excellent Webcam for Laptops,"This is easy to install, no issues with installing to Windows XP (SP2), looks good and not that expensive. From what I have read, works easily with all instant messaging tools, I have sued with Windows Messenger and Skype. The clip for laptop is a strong one. Strongly recommend getting this one."
1,Logitech Quickcam,"Stay away from this puppy! Has not worked from day one and even though it says that it is compatible with WIN2000 and with YM and Skype, it keeps on crashing the system after a few moments and even after downloading the most recent firmware/drivers and software, refuses to work.Have tried contacting Logitech tech support and not a peep out of them. Might as well stick with a no-name brand and save your money!"
2,Not too happy,"I use MSN everyday to video chat and thought that I should buy a decently priced web cam. Well, it turns out that my girlfriends $15 web cam does a better job then this one. I had to disable all of the automatic settings and manually configure it all myself to get a decent picture out of it. It overexposes everything!!!"
1,Logitech QuickCam,"I have been pleased with the video, but the audio on this product works so poorly that I must use a separate microphone. It appears to me to be a product malfunction."
1,Invasive software slowed PC and won't let me uninstall,"This invasive monster slowed my system and has permanently removed the change/remove programs icon from control panel. I uninstalled it and reset my system back a day and am still having problems. I did try to install it without software, but then the mic didn't work. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAMERA. IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL!!"
1,Very poor picture quality compared to other cams,"I paid close to $40.00 for this cam and found the picture video quality to be absolutely lousy. I have another logitech cam 9000 and they don't even compare. Honestly, this particular cam should be removed from Logitech's line. This is the only dissatisfaction I have ever had with Logitech, and I'm sure I'm not going to let one cam ruin my faith in Logitech. But for those looking for a webcam, stay away from this one, it really sucks.I would highly recommend Logitech 9000. I bought this particular cam for my desktop approximately a year ago and use it daily. It has great video, mic is clear on both ends, very easy to install and use. But I wouldn't pay over $80.00 for it. Its small enough too that it can be used easily on notebooks."
1,webcam,i bought two webcams and neither of them were any good i ended up purchasing a laptop with the webcam built in
3,Not a clear picture,"It's a nice little camera, however, my experience so far has been the video when using on Skype is blurry. Anyone I've called on Skype has said we come across kind of fuzzy. haven't tried it for pictures yet."
3,web cam review,"well,honeslty it could be much better for its price as the microphone doesnt work all the time"
3,Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks great except for sound,"I love everything about the Logitech QuickCam for Notebooks, except for the sound quality. It sounds really staticy. The size is great for laptop bags, the video quality is acceptable (manual focus though instead of automatic focus) Nice short cord. Fits well on laptop. But I returned it due to the sound quality not being optimal. Hard to talk to people over a webcam that emits static."
3,Not for Linux,"This is a good webcam, for windows. If you research this product you'll find that it is supported in Linux. However, Logitech updated this camera and if you type ""lsusb"" in the terminal for this product you will see ""ID 046d:08dd Logitech, Inc."". If you google this you'll find that no appropriate drivers are available. Do yourself a favor and do more research if trying to find a webcam for Linux. You'll save yourself;1. A couple of hours of time.2. Some money.3. A massive Linux hardware headache!"
1,Horrible,The picture was so unclear that I packaged it right back up after about 10 minutes of use. I'll be returning this tomorrow and probably getting the Microsoft web cam instead. Horribleeee !!
1,Logitec Webcam,"The camera works perfect, the microphone didn't work from the beginning. I even emailed about the product but never got a response. Horrible Seller."
2,Old Tech Dies Fast,"After a week of happy use it freezes video after a few frames; if any is captured at all. I repaired, uninstalled/reinstalled, checked device manager, updated my online chat progs, and nothing. As a very odd, but interesting thing, occasionally when I start the camera bits of my network soft/hardware exit with errors... That is really confusing me. Any suggestions would be well received, but the next step is to test the warranty. I do like their troubleshooting with its references to hardware and software error differentiation, and device manager checking. It reminds me very lightly and vaguely of the manuals for old hardware, where wiring schematics and complete rebuilt directions were included.... sigh.. so much is dumbed down, or guarded now."
4,Logitech Great Product,"I bought this quick cam last month and I love the ease of use that it provides. Its compact, has a great picture quality, has great audio and works well with Vista. Great product for laptops. The best quality is it's auto adjust to lighting. Low light or bright light the camera adjusts automatically. The only downside is that it has a manual focus. Logitech, in my experience, has always made a great product at a great value and this camera has proved to be a great buy!"
5,Great camera.,"Good camera. Small, portable, easy to setup and use. Good color and quality in most lighting conditions."
2,Not Informative At All,"I found very little technical information about the Zero in this film.Speed, Range Etc."
2,"Sole not rubber, therefore slippery","The price was remarkably low. Now my husband knows why: the sole is not rubber, therefore these boots are slippery. Yes, they are warm and have leather uppers. And they slip on (no pun intended) with ease--good for running outside to fill the bird feeders, turn on the car and scrape the windows, or take out the garbage. But currently, they're unusable because we're having a particularly icy winter. He'll still use them--when it thaws, but still cold--just not as much as he hoped. If the nature of the soles would have been disclosed by the seller, he probably would have sprung for one of the more costly like-pairs that came up on his search"
2,Leaky cap,When I received the cap was loose and got over other products i ordered. My daughter really enjoyed her book covered in it. Buy locally!!
3,Not sure about this one,"I ordered the Thera Putty as exercise for my hands because I have to hold dental instruments. I ordered the medium, however it was much too stiff for me to be able to use. My husband can't even use it. I was going to exchange it for a softer one, but as I was putting the lid back on the plastic container the bottom cracked and my thumb went through it... If I ordered it again I would get the softest one."
4,It's silly putty!,"This has all the properties of silly putty: it bounces; it's smooth and shiny; it stretches almost infinitely; it picks up newspaper ink; you can work it to the thickness of saran wrap; you can capture air in it and pop the bubbles. Oh, and it's therapeutic.I got the yellow ""soft"" variety. I would definitely not call it soft. It's hard to believe there are four grades of this stuff that are more firm than the yellow.I have large hands, and 4 ounces of putty is a good handful. You'd have to buy eight plastic eggs of the original silly stuff to get 4 ounces."
1,Left in the dark,"I ordered this Thera-Flex Therapy Putty, and was so surprised when I received a little plastic container with some orange putty. There were NO label on the container, NO instructions, and NO indication of what the contents were and from whom it came. I would have felt better if there was a company name somewhere, and perhaps some sell copy about the uses and benefits of this putty. I would not order this product again, and would not recommend it to anyone."
3,"Yes, it's hard","I should have paid more attention to the reviews that complained about how hard this putty is. I have been able to use it, however, by heating it in a microwave oven for about fifteen seconds before using it with each hand."
1,theraputty awful,"I am in therapy for a hand surgery. I purchased the coral theraputty because that is what I use in therapy. What I received was so hard and dried out, I threw it away."
3,Not bad for beginners,"The book explains the PMI knowledge areas taking software project management as a reference. Unfortunately I didn't see much of software specific discussions in the book.The book's structure was supposed to take you starting from project initiation through planning then executing and monitoring and controlling till the closing. Again, the authors couldn't stick to this plan as they had to jump to explain the closing of the cost KA during discussing the planning of it for no reason.I felt very much that we have 2 authors for the book, each one explains a specific topic in his own words in different places in the book, to the extent that we see 2 headlines with the same title ""Controlling project costs"" in different chapters, almost repeating the same ideas.The authors need to revise the structure of the book to make it a better.And if they can add more software specific problems like density of bugs ..etc , would be perfect"
1,Not useful because not specific to software development,"This book is just a rehash of the Project Management Institute's book, ""Project Management Book of Knowledge,"" which is an abstraction of procedures used in all project management. It is not specific to the process of building software at all. Don't buy this book, get one written by software people for software people."
2,Of Limited Use,"I bought this product recently to smooth out the bumps in my lawn. It didn't work very well, it's just not heavy enough. The ground has to be fairly soft for the roller to work, and my lawn was not that soft even after it recently rained 1 1/4 inches. I'll keep it around for when it has rained for a week."
5,Works great!,"I used it to flatten out some areas where I laid down fresh top soil. It was easy to put together, easy to fill-up, easy to drain and heavy enough to pack down the soil. When empty, it's light enough to hang from your garage wall. I'm 100% pleased."
1,Lawn Roller,Roller works fine. The plug for the water fill is defective. The lever tightener does not secure the plug
1,America gets the Short end of the stick,"Yes I love Gundam, but this is silly I bought mine from an importer a BNeautiful BOX set of the entire 08th and the MOVIE(s) on 3 DVDs Why cant they just sell me a 3 dvd BOX SET i wouldnt care if the Dvd cost $30-40. But over all this Series is a deep romantic story I LOVE IT."
5,Platoon meets Gundam,"This is one of my favorite Gundam sagas...the 08th MS (Mobile Suit) team! Taking place primarily on Earth in the thick of the Jungle to the deepest desert. This is as close anime will come to make you feel what war is like...Tragedy,love,hate,hopelessness,triumph...it's all here! Shiro,Sanders,Karen,Michel and Eledore bring life in the military during wartime to life. From their emotions during the heat of battle,to personal conflicts during R & R. You also get the classic plot twists, alterior motives on the part of both militaries and so much more. Oh yeah...the animation is pretty sweet too. When I sat through the 08th MS team this last weekend, I watched the whole thing from episode 1 to the end. Its gripping and enthralling...you WILL love it even if you're not an anime fan. Much deeper than Gundm Wing will ever be...like I say in the title...think Platoon or Apocalypse Now meets Gundam Wing. With that description,you only scratch the surfce of the 0th team."
5,This is to Gundam what Macross Plus is to Robotech.,"Yeah, its that good. The characters have depth, and focus. I was seriously impressed with everything: high quality animation, extremely engaging plot, and great action. While I don't think it will be as well received by the kids as Gundam Wing was, it should be a good intro to Gundam for people who like their anime a little deeper, darker, and hard edged."
5,One of the best gundam series ever,this is the best gundam series ever. It has great animation and did not drag out like gundam wing did. gundam wing went for ever and ever. by the end it was pointless. This is only 15 episodes long which is great. it is short but sweet. i highly reccommed this gundam series.
4,awesome cast chemistry!,"the cast chemistry is amaazing, they interact very well. the graphics and animation are crisp. this series is well worth the buy if u like to see gundams in a vietnam type setting. its more land based battles in volume 1 than space. i enjoyed it throughly, especially the in team bickering and conflict reslution! rent it first if ur not sure.God bless"
5,An Action Packed Gundam Episodes,"This is the best Gundam saga of all time.Because it has action,fighting,major Gundam war,its funny,good drama,a well written adult-oriented story line.Plus its better than the Cartoon Network version because its uncut!This volune of Gundam is the best I thank any Gundam fan should get this one!I loved this DVD volume of Mobile Suit Gundam the 08th Ms Team."
1,When is a gig bag not a gig bag?,"I recently purchased a violin bass and needed a gig bag for which I bought this one. The case may be stylish, but it is in no way rugged. The nylon casing is equal to that of a windbreaker, and the foam padding is so thin that I can easily pinch my fingers together through one layer of the case. This case offers little protection for an instrument. When is a gig bag not a gig bag? When it's a stylish dust cover."
2,Needs revising,"Out of the three books I recently used to tour the city, this one had the most errors when it came to restaurant listings. The writing was dry and as a guide it lacked personality."
3,A Good Effort,"Voice And Style isn't without its problems. You can tell that it's written by a fan and isn't warts and all (as I would have liked it to be). The style is alright as it allows for key subjects to tell their stories but I would have liked it if the book was in standard journalistic format presenting the interviews as well as the author's own commentary.The only problem here is that people who worked with Marc the longest such as Arnold Robinson and Denis Simpson aren't interviewed. They have key stories about Marc that need to be told. Hopefully, in an updated edition the author will get to tell it.Also, the one flaw I see is that it focuses on one specific time and Marc's impending death a little too much. It's too bad the book doesn't follow his life throughout and present all the background information the author acquired.This book is worth a read for anyone that is a fan of great music and wants to know more about one of the best A cappella groups in the world."
4,A very funny book!,"If you're a Mormon or otherwise familiar with the first part of ""The Book of Mormon,"" the subject matter here will be instantly recognizable. However, the catch is that this book is the same story, but written from Laman's point of view! This book is hillarious!"
4,Eternity II CD,"This is a long overdue follow up to the Eternity CD of Romantic music which Ibought in 1997. I still love the original, and it helped begin a new relationship.I played the original while serving a lady dinner about 4-5 months ago, and she said ""What is that music, I Love It !""Five months later, she also likes Eternity II, and keeps a copy of each on her PC and cds in the car.If you like soft, but really nice music, buy both of them"
5,The best!,This Land O Lakes mint hot chocolate is by far the best around! Try some and you won't be disappointed.
5,The best hot chocolate EVER,"This french vanilla delight is warm and soothing on a cold winter day, or even a not so cold day. I first received a few packs as a Christmas gift and was delighted to see it available from Amazon."
4,RARE BOOK COMBINING TAROT AND NUMEROLOGY,"Though I do not follow the so called Pathagoren numerology, since I feel it is no way as accurate as the Chaldean or Kaballah alphabet, this book was very helpful in giving more information behind the doubled numbers. In Chaldean numerology the doubled numbers carry as much weight as the single digits. They represent the spiritual side of a number while the single digit the physical side.Though the alphabet used in chaldean numerology is more accurate there aren't many books on what the doubled numbers signify. Cheiro's Book of Numbers by Cheiro is a good place to start but he doesn't give a whole lot of detail behind why a number is unfortunate.Many of the correspondances come from the tarot so I was pleased to find Numerology and Your Future as it delves into the doubled numbers all the way up to 72!You can gain much more info from your birthday and name by looking up the doubled number."
1,Unlistenable,"I tend to be curious about different cultures and people around the world, so I bought this CD on a whim when I saw it on a record store, trying to know about the music of Tibet. The liner notes say the monks are not performing but praying. Unfortunately, the CD is nothing but people wailing GRRRRRRR all the time. OK, call me a philistine, call me insensitive, call me whatever you want, but don't tell me I should like this CD. In fact, I think this CD is unlistenable. I'm open to different sorts of music that are not on the western classical tradition, I like Gregorian chant, I like Tuvan throat singing, but this hour of wailing is just unlistenable."
5,Gyuto Monks Chant,This is a fabulous recording of the monks that can help you achieve a sense of peace and serenity. I use it in my meditation and psychic developoment classes. It can help change your consciouness
5,Relaxing.,"I don't own a lot of chanting recordings. Yet, I have to admit that I find this exceptionally relaxing and very conducive to my evening meditation. The vocal gymnastics of these monks is interesting in and of itself. Each monk is singing a three note chord.In my old age I am getting more interested in spiritual matters and I've been reading a lot of Thomas Merton, Thich Nhat Hanh, HH The Dalai Lama, Dietrtich Bonhoeffer,etc. These Tibetan Chants have the unique beauty found in spiritual art."
5,Should be a secret,I'll tell you what buy this and then buy a higher end $100 bottle at Macy's...its gonna piss you off when you get more turning heads and more compliments then your $100 dollar bottle from Macy's...yeah it smells that good.
5,Love it !!,I love that fragance it is so good!!! For more than 15 years I keep asking my husband to go back to this one!!!
5,Tom Clancy's Rightful Heir,"There is a ""new kid"" on the block and Tom Clancy better watch out. Clancy's last book convinced me that he has lost his original punch and is riding on his reputation. Robert Wernli's book Second Sunrise fills the gap nicely. His story is compelling and keeps the reader's interest at a fevered pitch throughout. His characters are interesting people with dreams and aspirations to which we can all relate. The book has some interesting twists and turns and never lacks for excitement. The author's technical expertise combines nicely with his creativity both of which are evident in his descriptions of the technologies used throughout the story. It would be great to see this story on the silver screen."
1,Greenberg's guide to vintage lionel pricing,"A must have for every collector, offered at a great price."
1,"A GREAT WWII FIGHTER, BUT A POORLY PRODUCED DVD","I jumped at a chance to get a good DVD focusing on the P-47. Unfortunately that did not happen. What I got turned out to be a mismatched collection of scenes made up of some old, b&w, uninteresting shots with a few gun camera images here and there. All those were sprinkled lightly among a great many recently made color shots of somebody's very well maintained P-47 with a gawdy paint job not remotely suggestive of this great aircraft's role in helping to save the world. An attempt is made to weave a story or two into the DVD, but fails miserably. As a first or second year film student's production it would be received with a few yawns."
3,"A bit too superficial, but still OK","It's a nice video, but it's a bit too superficial for my taste. I want more details, and I want to see all the little details of the aircraft. Nice aerial shots though, and the training film is interesting."
4,Freddy Fresh -Last True Family Man,For me it is one of the best albums to make you smile and to make you movin'.Excellent melodies.
4,Careful intellectual biography,"D. G. Hart, formerly head librarian at Westminster Seminary, where most of the Machen papers are archived, has here written a careful intellectual biography of perhaps the most gifted conservative American theologian of the early twentieth century. As Hart well demonstrates, Machen's religious, political, and social views were hardly typical of contemporary fundamentalists. While this fact diminishes the ability of Machen to serve as a representative of any religious position, it also demonstrates that early twentieth-century religious conservatives ought not to be treated as cardboard caricatures--even when they are being compared with Machen."
2,Jottings it is,"""Jottings' he says and he does not lie. The superficiality of this book was a great disappointment. Here's what I got from this book: childhood was nice. School was hard. Italy was pretty. Parish life was fine; but the Troubles were hard. There are a few moments when he's writing about the Troubles when he seems to connect with his heart--and a few where his sense of humor finds him. On the whole, though, this was utterly flat."
5,The right choice,"This is the correct battery for the Nikon FE. I prefer the single large battery to the more common singles you have to stack. Fast shipping, great price."
4,Silver battery replacement,"I am using this lithium battery as a replacement for two silver (D76) batteries in my Olympus OM-2n SLR. So far so good, but I don't know if it will hold voltage as well as the silvers as it approaches ""end of useful life""."
4,Thoroughly Researched and Timely,"The groundwork for Priscilla's Letter was laid by famed scholar Adolph von Harnack, who first conjectured that Paul's colleague Priscilla may have written that book of the Bible known as ""Hebrews."" Ruth Hoppin has taken a giant step toward demonstrating Harnack's hypothesis, unearthing archaeological data and testimony to show clearly that Priscillan authorship is a viable suggestion that needs to be seriously considered. Hoppin also points out flaws in certain other popular theories about the authorship of Hebrews, rounding out her thorough analysis by pointing to the possible location of writing and destination of the letter. If you are interested in examining the roles of women in New Testament times, buy this book."
1,Priscilla's Letter,"From the very beginning man has attempted to undermine God's purpose and his pronouncements through his written word. To give credit other then Paul for Hebrews is ridiculous. This book, obviously lends no credence whatsoever in this attempt. ""God is not the author of confusion"", man is! (1 Cor. 14:33)The following is very apropos to this situation:""Let no one be seducing himself: If anyone among you thinks his is wise in this system of things, let him become a fool, that he may become wise. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written: ""He catches the wise in their own cunning"". (1Cor. 3:18-19). Save your money folks..."
3,Nice grip but...,"2 pins got bent after the first use and the dog had soft, matt free fur. But then again, this happens with most of these pin type brushes."
4,Seems to work well,I bought this brush about a year and a half ago however I didn't buy it from Amazon. I like the brush and it works just fine on both my Golden Retreivers. I don't use the brush side as much as the comb side. Both dogs seem to like either when being brushed. The comb sides combs are begining to be pushed into the soft material holding them so it's not working like it did. If I remember corretly this is normal for this type of brush. I left feedback for both the flea comb and large comb. I maybe replacing the brush as long as it is like the picture. If it isn't I'll be sending it back.
4,"What Crown would call, ""No wisdom, only information"".","This book is a mix of good and some bad. This book should definetly be a prime choice for any fencer. Unfortunetly, Gaugler likes to be wordy a lot in his book, and therefore is not what some would call ""reader friendly"". In fact, the book is so unbelievably wordy, it scares away many potential readers. The enormous, unfriendly graphs and charts dont help either.The book does not go any deeper than mere mechanics, while some would consider it good, since it means also keeping out the bias and the complaining, it also means no reviewing of the mental side of fencing, which can draw a lot of potential readers away.Bottom line: The book should definetly be bought, but if you want to go a little deeper into fencing thought, go get yourself one of Evangelista's books..."
1,"dated material, not useful for vast majority of fencers","The material in this book was presented in at a well ordered, brisk pace, if only the information was useful to the modern fencer. The section on foil is obviously the best (the book being old-school italian style), but lacks any training other than bladework. The epee and sabre styles are little more than additions to foil, and are not representitive of current national and world style. The lessons are poorly laid out, only being useful if the person has taken lessons from a coach before, in which case the book is mostly useless. There is no mention of footwork exercises anywhere in the book, a condemning mark in my opinion. This book may be useful to a fencing historian, but anyone looking to improve their game would be better off (lacking a coach) going to tournaments and talking to other fencers."
2,Not for modern fencing,"This book has little useful information relating to the modern sport. Absolutely NO attention is paid to the rules, concepts of right-of-way, or direction. The book spends all its time on the mechanics of movements with no attention paid to tactics. Furthermore, figures are sparse, and few illustrations are present to detail the evolution of the movements. The book uses the Italian hand positions rather than the easier to understand and more prevalent (in my experience) French numbering. Too much attention is paid to relaxed, exhibitionist movements rather than the overall goal: to score touches and win. Finally, the preference for all things Italian is excessive and unhelpful with insufficient translation.This is an excellent book for those not serious about or have no interest in competition. Do not buy this book otherwise as it is useless to you."
5,"A fencing book that really ""gets to the point.""","Many fencing books provide a basic introduction to the sport of fencing, but this book provides substantial information for the fencer who is past the introductory stage. The instructional information actually provides a sufficient description of compound attacks and defenses to enable the reader to visualize and practice the described moves. It also has an extremely useful summary of attacks and defenses, including for each attack suggested parries and ripostes. Truly the fencing book for the fencing scholar.But, be warned that Maestro Gaugler describes the Italian school of fencing, which has terminology and techniques notably different from the perhaps more familiar French school and therefore some adjustment of your mindset may be necessary to get the most out of this book. En garde!"
4,3 1/2 stars--,"Not intense and arty as the best B Surfers, but it is a fun listen. Good music to drive to. A couple songs sound like pop songs from the sixties but sung by an alchie (the song LETTER would be a good example). On first listen I didn't think much of the cd, it wasn't as perverse as I hoped it would be, but on second listen I started hearing the songs for the simple fun weirdness they do have."
2,His problem is that this album isn't very good,"Gibby seems to mean well with this album... It is a return to guitar rock after the Buttholes last album, which was bogged down somewhat with too much electronics. There are even some moments where the guitar really gets going and I am reminded of some of Paul Leary's finest work. Unfortunately, after 4 or 5 listens, I still can't recall any of the melodies. ""Jet Fighter"" from the last Buttholes album is better than anything you'll find here. It's pretty tame and forgettable. The production sounds a little too clean. And as for the lyrics... Superman gets really good weed? It's a long way from ""I saw an x-ray of a girl passing gas"". It's not bad... It just isn't very good."
4,Review of Westinghouse Sweepeze Vacuuming System,"This product has performed as I expected. I had seen one at my hairdresser's salon and thought it would be great for my home.It sure is nice to just sweep up the dog hair from two German Shepherdsso easily. Also, I paid half of what my hairdresser paid for hers. Sheshould have shopped Amazon!"
3,"Good, but not what I understood from web reviews","The book is well-written and describes the installation and use of the toolkit enclosed on the accompanying CD/ROM. The toolkit is good and fills a needed niche for those who want to produce complex and polished documents without understanding how Word works ""under the covers"". If this is what I wanted, I would give it either four or five stars.What this book does not do is talk in depth about how Word actually works and how to either take advantage of that or work around it (like the fact that you can't really ""lock"" styles). My impression from reading web reviews prior to purchase, was that the book did this. My bad; it really doesn't."
4,Great Value,"There is nothing flashy about the Sony CDX GT-110. It has all the basics expected in a radio/CD player plus some very nice extras. I have installed this unit in a sailboat and use the auxiliary input to connect to a satellite radio, MP3 player and a DVD player. The built in equalizer is handy. It is truly a great value."
2,Runs well for a little under two years,This pump runs reliably for a little under two years. I just bought my third one yesterday and had a note to myself to buy another one next month so that I'd have it when the current one failed. Unfortunately I was one month under in my prediction. I predicted one year 10 months and it failed at one year nine months.I run mine 24 hours a day every day in a pond that holds around 400-500 gallons.A filter tip that works for me after years of experimentation and does not require a lot of maintenance: put about an inch of aquarium gravel in the bottom of a medium square pond plant basket. Place the pump inside the basket and then cover it with more gravel so the gravel is to the top of the basket. Every few weeks or as needed vacuum the upper layer of gravel with a large Python aquarium siphonPython No Spill Clean and Fill. Vacuuming the gravel will restore the water flow.
2,Disappointed,The pump does not come with adaptors for the outlet to match up with your existing hoses...you have to go to a hardware store for fittings to hook it up. Most other reputable manufacturers provide them with the pump.
4,sy's exclamation point for the millenium,"fascinating... it's a look forward and backward. it reminds me a lot of the spaciousness of sound that the band achieved with bad moon rising, although a lot less disciplined.i remember seeing a clip on vh1 once with lee ranaldo talking about city sounds and how he loved to open his window and listen to the rhythms of everyday street noises. this album captures it beautifully, with its random occurences of guitar squawks, cymbal crashes, and syllables.although i have already dismissed some of the songs (the nascent ""edges"" among them), i have a feeling that this one pays off on each successive listen. ""pendulum music"" and ""six for new time"" are damn near highpoints of sy's career- it's the kind of pretention that they have always reached for. this time it works better in execution than theory.if this is their millenial exit, i can't wait to see what they're going to come up with for an entrance."
5,Breathing room.,"I have collected most of Sonic Youth's albums over the years, and this is presently my favorite. Featuring music composed by the likes of John Cage and Takehisa Kosugi as well as Yoko Ono and Steve Reich, the long tracks massage and spark. Unlike the usually in-your-face brashness that makes sonic youth sonic youth, this album features wide spaces of repetitive sounds that layer, merge and then gradually taper away. This is truly an innovative album, unlike any other from Sonic Youth. Few vocals except for Kim Gordon's occasional spoken (shouted?) word. I love it and haven't taken it off the turntable since I got it."
4,"The ""other""Sonic Youth","It's funny, I recall how six years ago I thought Sonic Youth was just ""this cool skate-punk band"" when I purchased ""Dirty."" Little did I know that they would later have more in common with Sun Ra and Stockhausen than Reagan Youth.I have to argue that SYR 4 is perhaps their most surreal and ear-baffling work to date. On most of its tracks, their trademark ecstatic-alien guitar noise makes more sense as electro-aucostic pieces and even folk music for our bewildered information age. Examplary tracks are the John Cage covers and ""Never Played a Note for Percussion.""While it does have its misfires(the room-clearing Reich cover and ""Edges""-nearly summarizes what many people love to hate about avant-garde music,)overall, I have to say that this album will be closely studied and appreicated for quite some time...much longer than the Warped tour."
4,Can you guess what it is yet?,"Well this is one Sonic Youth's more experimental releases ( if you hadn't gathered by now ) and it's fair to say that this is a challenging listen. You'll need to keep your wits about you and a sense of humour to contain this on first listen. It's quite possibly one of those "" gets on your nerves "" sort of album at first albums. But give it time and you appreciate the album that it sets out to be. You're not going to absolutely love this but you can enjoy it for what it is or yank it out of your stereo system and criticize Sonic Youth as bulls**t poseurs. It all means the same thing - nothing!"
2,Re Experimental,"Worst purchase of the year. No new ground broken, so calling it experimental would be a mistake. Re experimental maybe. Nurse With Wound (and oh so many others) has been producing truly intriguing and bizzare minimalist experimental music for years. Maybe I'm jaded, but there was nothing even remotely interesting to me on either of these discs. A sad copycat attempt from a band who hasn't had any decent new material in years. Keep the taps flowing and be well!"
3,Do sonic youth take themselves seriously anymore?,"what the hell? a lot of this is painful to listen to. i dont understand why theyre doing this. sonic youth is the best band in the world and it seems like theyre just messing with our heads. anyway theres some good stuff on here, when they performed some of these live at the bell atlantic jazz festival, it sounded cool. and lee said whats up to me from the stage...that was cool."
4,Inspiring thoughts of and about mothers,"This book of inspirational thoughts, verses and quotations (many of them scriptural) about mothers (all of us have or had one) range from Florence Nightingale,""Life is a splendid gift. There is nothing small in it.For the greatest grow by God's law out of the smallest,"" to the humorous, ""A mother is a sage who is wise enough to know when her son has reached the stage at which he would rather die than be kissed in public."" This is easy to thumb through in an hour yet easy to re-visit for thought, reflection and inspiration I'm keeping extra copies just to send in place of a card with gifts for new babies."
4,Thought-provoking and Sexy,"I was expecting this novel to be like erotica I have read in the past - entertaining, but shallow and raunchy. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised that while The Velderet was definitely sexy, it was also intellectual and thought-provoking. The story was one of passion, humanity and understanding. It explored how we view sex and pushed the boundaries, giving you sex scenes that not only made you hot, but also made you think.This is definitely a book any fan of erotica should check out. It has an assortment of steamy sex scenes, but it's not another pointless and plotless erotic novel."
2,S/M seeks SF. Objective: literature,"The biggest point in this book is that what's equal and what's equitable are two different things. Except in a few very narrow senses, enforced equality enforces what a lot of people just don't want. See - I did find something nice to say!The story has a familiar sound: the aliens come, and it turns out that their breeding physiology and recreational practices are very compatible with the invadees. There's the Mars Needs Women theme, but this time the men are of interest, too. (Right. And just like on Star Trek, the females of this alien species probably look pretty good in a bikini, too.) **SPOILER** After being stood up for a date by someone who doesn't even know his name, the Invading Overlord threatens destruction of the race unless -- well, once again, the aliens come. The submissives save the world (!?!).Only ordinary s/m, barely ordinary sci fi. Read something nice from Black Lace or in one of Violet Blue's collections instead.//wiredweird"
4,FUN.... BUT NOT SURE HOW YOU'D FIGURE IT OUT,"This is the second murder mystery game I've played. The first was a different brand and was ZERO fun.... it was scripted and IMPOSSIBLE to figure out. This one was WAY better! Besides the introduction there is NO script! You can quiz one another and find holes in people's stories all on your own! There are ""secret facts"" each player has which makes the game really interesting too as you try to figure out who everyone REALLY is. I do think the ending was pretty hard to get though. Overall, I would recommend this game!"
5,excellent!,I love the variety of spreads in this book and also Konraad's method for learning the meanings of the cards.
2,Unsubstancial,Feels too light and cheap. Doesn't say Gerber on it anywhere. I expected much better quality from a Gerber product.It will do the job but no better than other similar products you'd find at Home Depot.
5,Great shirts for the money,"I bought 5 of these shirts since when I bought them they were only $47. Still at $69 they are a good deal. They are soft enough to wear directly against the skin -- feel great, no itching. I wash mine on delicate and lay flat to dry."
3,They sent the wrong color !,"Bought the product for my brother. It looked fine, nice enough but they sent me wrong color. I needed to give it to him as a gift so did not have time to send it back. Anyways I guess they dont pay good attention to your order is my opinion. :("
5,Quite Impressed,"These discs are definitely worth your while (you get 2 discs of Paganini's works in their completion, for a pretty cheap fee, now that's efficiency if you ask me). The 24 Caprices recorded here are taken from a live performance, that's right, a live performance, all 24. Markov, in his full Russian superiority, is one of the few violinists in the world that has balls big enough to play all 24 in one show. After listenening to the first 23, you would think that he would run out of steam at the 24th, arguably the best one, but that is certainly not the case here. The flawless execution of this one proves beyond all opposition the utter greatness of this Paganini interpreter. Oh, the concertos are pretty damn good too."
5,a Great violinist,"Lord Yehudi Menuhin has written ""He is without doubt one of the most brilliant and musical of violinist...Alexander Markov will certainly leave his mark on the music-lovers of the world and in the annals of the violin virtuosi of our day"".Alexander Markov has established a reputation second-to-none in the nineteenth century virtuoso repertoire. His recording of Paganini's 24 Caprices for solo violin caused a sensation, and he remains one of the very few violinists who program the entire set in a single recital. A widely broadcast film of Markov playing the Caprices, directed by Bruno Monsaingeon, has won these fiendishly difficult pieces an instantaneous and enthusiastic following around the world.The Gold Medal winner at the Paganini International Violin Competition, Mr. Markov has appeared with such celebrated orchestras as the Philadelphia Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris and the BBC Symphony to a great public and media acclaim"
5,Lovely video!,It was fun to watch this video of beautiful hummingbirds with a close-up view! Good information about hummingbirds. Made in Minnesota!!
4,90's music videos,"I liked it. There was a great video of Robin Thicke, an Adam Duritz video and others. It didn't get 5 stars because alot of the videos were just okay. How ever I would still buy it again if I didn't already have it."
2,Not for me,"I did not really like this book. I misunderstood the information given about it. I wanted a book that had basic recipes for beans and peas. You know the old timey ones with a hamhock, potlicker, and you pour it over a big slab of cornbread. This book as some good information about how to get started with dry beans & how to identify the different peas & beans, but the recipes were not what I was looking for. I will make some of the soups during the fall and winter months, but nothing much else."
4,Some serious talent!,"Okay, I will say this right off the bat... I'm a HUGE Joe Phillips fan, and adore his work (especially the calendars), so its no real surprise that I was really pleased with my purchase of ""For the Boys"". I suppose the only thing that didn't make me really flip out over it was that the vast majority of the work was stuff that had been previously published, whether it was in the calendars, cover art for Xodus magazine or on his website. Having said that though, it was nice to see the calendar images away from their ""calendar context"", and to just enjoy the total beauty of the ""Joe-niverse"".If you're a Joe fan, the book is well worth having... if you're a fan of those lush coffee table photo books, it might make a nice change from all that black and white photography. Joe fills his art with such beautiful colours as well as intricate detail, its hard NOT to fall in love with it."
4,Good Resource,"I think this is an excellent book. It gives alot of good ideas on how to take daily or special events to let your child transition better and communicate about these events. It is for high functioning kids which the book does state, but I found myself trying to make the schedules or the trip to the store more my own so I think lower functioning kids could benefit. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is that the pictures are not colored and the mini idea schedules: going to the store and getting ready for bed will not be necessarily the same order you have your kids do it, so you will have to change it anyway. It did give me a good start on some things to help with communication. It's an easy read!"
2,It's a marketing video,They are all sitting around talking about how the supplements are the best and that's what they took to get huge. They do mention a little about training and diet.
3,"Okay, but not great!","You get descent tips from world class bodybuilders and trainers, but offers little in way of variety. Honestly you'll get much better info from a Bodybuilding magazine than this DVD. All the bodybuilders have little to no personality (except Branch) and you get rather bored pretty quick into it. I have it 3 stars because they explain basic movements and show how to perform them with perfect execution so there is some substance to this DVD, but not much. Don't waste your money unless you can get it for cheap."
3,Great Except for expiration dates...,"This is a brand I've used over the years and both selling price and delivery were top notch. However, having purchased a quantity of bottles at one time, it was dismaying to find the expiration date for all was under 6 months. It will mean taking expired supliments since I purchased a year's worth! I'd assumed I would be shipped fresh inventory. Not so. Buyer beware."
2,No noticable benefit,"For me, the only noticable effect was an increase in chin whiskers!Definitely not what I had in mind.Hope future users have better luck."
5,Bye Bye Pigeons!,Scared off the pigeons living on my roof when we installed it on the roof so happy days! My dog occasionally forgets its fake and barks at it... after poking it with a stick he soon remembers!
4,Item is Owl-right...,"After the local stores here sold out on the the wooden owls I decided to purchase a couple of these owls and they seem to do their job ok. I would recommend hanging them off a bungee spring or cord to give the owl some movement. It seems to do the job better than leaving it stationary. You will need to fill it with sand or rocks to help weigh it down for balance.Overall, they seem to be working out pretty well."
1,Fake Owl / Fake Scare,"If I could reach in front of the owl to photograph it; to show you the pigeons sitting next to it, you would laugh. Don't bother spending your money on these. 0 Stars for Dalen OW6 Gardeneer 16-Inch Molded Owl. Waste of my money for 2 owls."
2,DOES NOT WORK !!,"Does not work...period !! Nicely painted item! Xmas gifts for old ladies 2012. Could make nice money box.OR, fill it with sand and put it in the garden with the gnomes."
3,So so...,Purchased this to help keep some of the squirrels out ouf the yard so my dogs would bark less. Does not seem to help all that much.
3,Trying to keep birds out of my boat with owl purchased from Amazon,We originally sat it on our deck railing near a suet woodpecker feeder. Did not scare them at all! nor squirrels who like the railing. :-)It now hangs over our boat in its lift. So far no more ducks trying to get into the boat but they do still like the dock nearby.Not sure it is really doing any good at scaring birds away.
5,exactly as advertised,The owl looks very realistic and once it has some weighty material in it to keep it from blowing away it will be great to keep unwanted pests out of the yard.
3,disappointed,"The owl was supposed to have a head that swiveled. It's head does not swivel. It's ok, but I was disappointed."
2,Nice Ornament,"Very detailed owl, but worthless in terms of keeping birds away. If you just want a decoration this is great, but if you have unwanted birds they will only laugh at this."
2,Didn't help with my ducks...,"I bought this to try to stop some ducks from coming up on my dock. I filled it up with sand, put it out there and for a day there didn't seem to be any ducks. I moved it regularly as to not have it look like a statue. However, within 2 days the ducks we're back - and literally snuggling with the owl.The product came as advertised and quickly, so if you are using it to do something other than keep ducks away, it may work for you."
4,Big Owl scare tiny birds,"We were being plagued with tiny birds pecking at their reflection in our kitchen windows. We tried a number of things until I thought of an Owl which I would use like a scarecrow. Low and behold, it did the job and it also looks cool sitting on our pot shelf. C.A.R. Brentwood, CADalen OW6 Gardeneer 16-Inch Molded Owl"
4,alen Owl,These owls do work if you hang them up so they move constantly. Do not expect to get results if you just sit them out.The birds will still come around.
1,Does not work at all! Waste of money.,"This product does nothing to keep birds away. If birds are your problem, don't waste your money!"
2,Ineffective with squirrels,"If anything, this thing actually attracts squirrels from around the neighborhood. A disappointment to me, as I was looking for a humane way to rid my property of the cute pests."
3,"Convincingly lifelike appearance; The critters are smarter, though.","My mom had voiced her complaints to me about the birds and rats that would come and eat the fruit off of her fruit trees. That's why I bought this guy. All in all, it looks convincingly lifelike. However, there is one part where it fails - The birds and rats are smarter than a fake owl...My mom told me that when she was carrying the owl out to set him up, one of the birds in the yard flew away, squawking in terror, when it saw the owl. That was a promising sign. She followed the directions to move the owl at least every couple of days. It worked well for a week or so. Then she'd see the birds and rats attacking her plant again... It looks like they figured out Mr. Fake Owl wouldn't eat them.All in all, it's decent. Just don't expect them to stay fooled... I think the only way for us to keep our fruit safe is to build a metal mesh enclosure around the trees...."
1,Didn't impact the pigeon's presence in my roof,"The Owl looks very good, close to the real thing. Unfortunately the pigeons on my roof does not seem to care at all for the fake Owl... They didn't leave or change their usual habit a bit. I have a very tall, 2 story house and to climb and move the Owl around is very hard. Have to think for some other means for defense from the nasty birds..."
3,"Sorta helped in the beginning, but effect wore off","So I bought one of these as a possible solution to keep birds from landing on my cars side mirrors and leaving their waste behind. I literally placed the owl on my car in different spots every single day. It worked well the first day and then there was just 1 dropping the next day and eventually after a few weeks it was just ignored. I placed it in different spots everyday as well. I would say it reduced the amount of waste I was getting on my car, but it did not eliminate it. For the price, still something that would work in the garden and look okay though."
3,Birds don't give a HOOT!,These owls (I bought two of them) scared my horses half to death but the birds just ignored them. Now they are cute barn decorations covered with bird droppings. Great Halloween props. My horses are adjusted to them so if we ever meet a plastic owl on the trail I am sure my horses won't spook.
2,Your mileage may vary,"We put this into place to keep birds from eating all of the outdoor catfood, and I can say that at least with starlings, this guy doesn't phase them in the least. He was knocked over and perched on as they attacked the food.This might work with other birds or in other cases, but not for hungry blackbirds."
2,Not very scary,I puchased the owl in the hopes of scaring off a pair of nesting barn owls. The barn owls are great but the fledgings are a nightmare with their screeching and keep us awake every night. This owl didn't scare anything and they are sitting in the nesting box awaiting the eggs I suspect.
2,Dumb birds,"I've got the dumbest birds around here. They fly in my pole barn through the 16 foot door and can't get out the same way . They fly around the rafters untill they drop dead from thirst and hunger. Hope it works, I'm getting tire of cleaning up dead birds and poop."
2,owl,I was very disappointed that the Dalen Molded Owl did not scare the birds away from nesting in my rafters on my carport.What a mess they make.mountainmom
3,Dalen OW6 Gardeneer 16-inch molded owl,"I am angry and not really pleased with the product.....I ordered one of the brownish owls pictured in the advertisement to help keep the birds away from my car.I already have one owl which looks exactly like the one in the advertisement and it has helped a great deal, however I needed a second one. The brown life-like tones of the one I already have and which are advertised make the owl really look real. Therefore when I ordered a second one, I was shocked when it came and was it is in blackish tones and looked in no way like the advertisement or the one already in my tree. I sent it back, explained the issue and reordered.....only to have another black owl sent to me! What is the problem? Why did the manufacturer change the advertised coloration which was really good....to one that has only a vague resemblence of the former life-like owl? I am not pleased and would like to be able to address the company directly...."
1,Forget it!,"Bought this owl locally to try to keep the various birds out of my vegetable garden. No luck at all with that! I even tried moving it to different places in the garden, but the doves and smaller birds just ignore it. My daughter brought up a good point. Owls are nocturnal and birds are day creatures so why should they be afraid of owls??"
1,Makes great nest for mice,Mice have gotten inside and made a nest for themselves.I take it that this not a good sign that this is a good deterrent for rodents.
3,Dalen Owl,This was a gift for my father's garden. So far it is doing it's job to keep birds out of his garden although there isn't much in it right now.
1,Don't waste your money...seriously.,"I bought this because we had a large number of pigeons in our yard due to the fact that our neighbor thinks it's awesome to throw 5 handfuls of bird food on his roof each morning. -__-It doesn't work at all. Within 1 hour we had 4 pigeons within 3 feet of the ""Prominently placed"" owl."
1,Birds laughed at it!,"I have been having a HUGE problem with birds crapping all over my deck and no matter what I do, they won't go away. I'm tired of hosing down my deck everyday so I bought this owl hoping it would do the trick and keep birds away - it didn't do a thing! Birds basically laughed at this ""owl"" and would sit right next to it and still make a mess! I moved it around everyday (as suggested) but the birds didn't care; they knew it was fake. Well, back to the store this goes. Don't bother buying this garbage."
4,Great looking owl,"I love the eyes. Doesn't seem to have cut down on the bird poop on the porch, but I have a new wise friend."
4,So far so good!,My wife was tired of cleaning bird poop from the back porch and was looking at enclosing the patio. I ordered the Mr. Owl to give it a try and she's been amazed that it has kept the birds at bay. So far so good!
5,Keeping squirrels & chipmunks away from my yard,These owls are ideal as a humane way to drive squirrels away from chewing up the redwood play set. The damage they did prior to the owls was extensive. Now they seem to avoid the playset as long as I periodically move the owls around. The only alternatives were to watch them completely destroy it or kill them. This was a more acceptable alternative and one that my wife and kids can live with.
2,too tame,"very nice plastic owl, would scare me in the dark, but doesn't scare any critters or birds."
3,"16"" Owl","Delivered timely and looks okay. However, only slows birds down. It's not keeping them away."
1,A Ducks Favorite Companion,"We have a problem with ducks sunbathing on our dock. It hadn't happened yet this season so I put the owl out to ward off any ducks that might be thinking of it so no habits are formed. In less that 2 hours there were 5 ducks on the dock...all at the base of Owl! Strangely enough, I've had no ducks on the dock since I took the owl off (about two weeks). I know that will change but it's giving me time to think of something new. You might want to save your money on this one."
5,This Owl Works!,"After three years of chasing off sparrows from nesting on my covered deck, only to have them come back again and again day after day, I bought this owl. As long as you repo it around a bit every few days, it chases them away. I see them flying in, then flying out. So far so good."
1,Forget It,"I purchased the Dalen owl with excited possiblites. The neighborhood birds have taken over and driven our 6 year shih tzu into exile, soiled walk-ways and bbq grill, and caused general havoc. After 3 days it was obvious that the ""owl"" was and is totally useless. The promotional material states that every two minutes the head was to turn. Too bad, because it never ever happened."
5,So far so good,"I got this to see if it would deter a pigeon that poops all over a balcony, I didn't want to do anything to harm the bird, just try to see if I could discourage it. SO far so good, it came back to the balcony yesterday, looked at the plastic owl and left....maybe in the future it will get used to it and it will no longer work, but so far it has been a humane way of keeping it away. Got here in 2 days, so delivery was right on time."
5,"Dalen 16"" Owl","We filled this owl with sand and it has kept the birds off of the wrought iron railing on our front porch. We move the owl around every few days and it works! The owl I bought was the best price I found, and the delivery was speedy!!! I would highly recommend it for anyone having problems with birds."
4,Garden Owl,"I purchased this for my garden and it really does look quite real. It is quite light, so will have to find a way to weight it down so it stays in the garden. I am bothered by chipmunks and other animals and hope this will do the trick to scare them off."
2,"THey Look Great and Real, but they do not deter other birds","We bought 4 of these to mount in the yard to keep birds away from our pool. Within an hour of installing them, birds were sitting next to them or on them. Don't waste your money if you want then to scare other birds. They look great as decoration though."
4,Cool owl,"""The owls are not what they seem."" - from Twin PeaksThis owl is cool. Plastic and hollow, its very light. Realistic and scary looking."
4,Dalen Gardeneer Owl,"All looks as advertised on web page. Seems sturdy plastic, and amazingly ""IT'S MADE IN THE U.S.A."""
5,Owl,This is great. An actual owl tried to fight it and didn't know what to do. Don't have to worry about out tiny dog becoming an owl snack!
2,"Nicely Made, But Scared the Dog, Not the Birds!","This owl is nicely made, hand-painted with big clear realistic eyes, so I had high hopes for it. My goal was to scare away the sparrows that nest in the Spanish tiles on my roof and constantly poop on my balcony and the railing surrounding it.My dog went nuts when I put the owl on the table, barking like crazy until I let her go out and examine it, so I figured that it must look pretty realistic to a non-human eye and that the pesky birds and their poop would soon be gone.My hopes were dashed, however, when I looked out the door to the balcony yesterday afternoon and saw one of the little sparrows standing on the rail right next to the owl, pecking at its ear.Oh, well -- it'll look good in the garden, I guess."
4,Killer,"You people are on crack. This was a great event. It had it all... KO's, controversy, blood. A must own. By the way, the Tank/Cabbage fight was kick ass. To say that one fighter wimped out and 'let the fight be stopped' is simply ignorant. The doctors stopped the fight because of a brutal cut above the eye. The fighter has no say in such a thing I am sorry to say. Buy this DVD, it rocks."
1,One of The Worst UFC Shows of All Time,"Ultimate Fighting Championship is a U.S.-based mixed martial arts (MMA) organization, currently recognized as the major MMA promotion in North America.UFC 45 - Revolution is flat out, a terrible event. The card is full of everything you don't want in a Mixed Martial Arts show. Terrible fights, brawls that look more akin to bum fight, and idiotic officating decisions. The fact that this event marked the UFC's 10th anniversary made the effort all that more pathetic. The only remotely interesting fight on paper is the heavyweight showdown between Ricco Rodriguez and Pedro Rizzo. The fight was relegated to prelim status and featured two old men circling around the octagon for 15 minutes.UFC 45 will go down in the books as being one of the UFC's worst PPV events. Stay away from this one at all costs."
1,10th anniversay is a great failure,"UFC 45 is a remarkably bad event. The only decent fight on the card is one that holds no bearing on nternational rankings and is between two guys who have never amounted to anything and never will(Lytle and Lawler) OTher than that the rest of the show is terrible. I mean sure, if you enjoy watching two overweight fat slobs throw punches at each other for a round than you might enjoy it, but if you are a true fan of MMA than this show is the pits. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind."
1,agree with others it doesn't work,tried making some hard candy and it started to caramelize at the 230F point - not good! i'm going to buy another thermometer from another company.
1,Didn't work for me.,"This thermometer just didn't work. I ruined a batch of carmel because the gage wouldn't rise above 220. I don't know if I just got a ""bad"" one, but I'm not going to find out by exchanging it. When I return it, I'm getting a different, more trusted brand."
1,Don't Buy,"Used twice, the first time I compared it to my mom's trusty forty year old thermometer and this one was way off. Tried it a second time and it quit working altogether."
4,Better way to apply sunscreen,"Rather than the liberal application of a squeeze bottle this is a nicer, cleaner and easier to store way of handling sunscreen. We actually preferred it when the wipes were individually wrapped so we could keep a couple in a purse or a bike bag (etc.) but this is still better than a bottle of goop."
2,"Intel P4 compatible; but, quickly crashes","Yup, it will work on an older Pentium board; and, comes with the needed P4 connector. Even offers a SATA and a PCIE connection cable. Install is easy; and, it runs quietly, at least initially. After that, it doesn't run. This one did so only briefly; and, continually shut down, following the first cold boot, after install. Of course, it took down the PC, rendering it useless. Maybe you'll have better luck. Amazon made it right. Will look for a higher-power, P4 compatible power source."
1,Inaccurate readings,"I admit I have not purchased this product--and you'll see why. I saw a bunch of them yesterday in my local Home Depot and was prompted to take a photo of 3 thermometers that were on the shelf together. The readings vary greatly between thermometers (61 degrees, 71 degrees and 75 degrees), so what's the point of having one of these? Well, you'll know within 13 or 14 degrees what the temperature really is. Your thermometer might read 75 degrees and you'll wonder why you're cold: Could it be because it's really only 61 degrees?To be fair, the product (on the box) is described as ""decorative."" :-D"
1,It would make a better Frisbee than a thermometer!,"My expectations for this thermometer were very simple: I expected that this thermometer would work! I expected that if it was 68 degrees in the house this thermometer would read 65-70 degrees and if it was 35 degrees, it would read 32 to 38 degrees. I think these are very low expectations to have! In fact, when it was 68 degrees in the house, this thermometer read 60 and when it was 35 on my outside porch, it read 40 degrees. Bottom-line: this thermometer is so inaccurate it is useless. It seems to have a very limited response range (between 40 and 60 degrees). I purchased a Thomas-brand outdoor thermometer and when it is 68 degrees, it reads 68 degrees and when it is 35 degrees, it reads 35 degrees! I am returning this Chaney Instrument Acu=Rite thermometer immediately."
2,SHORT LIFE THERMOMETER,LASTED SIX MONTHS. IS NOW WORTHLESS. A TEMP. OF 10 ABOVE AND THIS PRODUCT STOPS WORKING. SO MUCH FOR QUALITY.
2,Not the best thing Kraft makes,"I can't really recommend this stuff at all. The salad dressing is NOT included and they've changed the taste so much from their original, that you cannot even recognize it anymore. I won't buy it anymore - I used to buy it almost weekly. Come on Kraft, bring back the original!"
5,UNBELIEVABLE,"I HAD TRIED TO ORDER THIS BOOK FROM ANOTHER DEALER BUT THEY FAILED. I CAN ONLY SAY THAT IF THIS BOOK WAS USED, I WILL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR WORD FOR IT. IT IS FANTASTIC CONDITION. IT IS IN BETTER CONDITION THAN ANY BOOK I HAVE EVER BOUGHT NEW. I MIGHT ADD THAT I AM 63 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE SEEN QUITE A FEW NEW BOOKS AS I READ 4 TO 5 BOOKS A WEEK. DELIVERY TIME WAS EXCEPTIONAL.HATS OFF!! I WILL ALWAYS CHECK WITH YOU FIRST. ONLY PROBLEM IS THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH STARS FOR A REVIEW."
5,"Really nice selections from an illustrious, but alas too brief, career.","I highly recommend this CD, especially to those new to Nightnoise. It is a nice representation of some of their best cuts. How sad that Micheal is gone, and there won't be any more of their superbly original music added to the universe!"
4,Wonderful Celtic New Age Music!!!,"I first heard Nightnoise in the early 80's. I had won a cassette tape in a radio contest, and it was a Windham Hill Collection. One of the songs on it was The Cricket's Wicket (which is on this CD) and is probably one of their best known songs. It's also one of my favorites by them. Toys Not Ties and several others are also very good. This is wonderful celtic new age music!!!"
4,Great and interesting read,I have the author as a professor in college. It's a quick and good read. He summarizes the stories of the men executed in Utah. Lots of fun!
5,Love this book,Our children enjoyed this book and now it has become a favorite story for us to read to our younger grandchildren. They love putting their finger in the hole and touching the soft fur. I was excited to find this book still available to give as a Christmas stocking stuffer.
5,Travel socks truly help,"After an 18 hour flight to and from South Africa, my legs were comfortable and crampless the entire trip thanks to the Futuro travel socks for ladies. I wore the 'mild' socks and they offered the right amount of support for me. I weigh about 150, so I got the Large size. The large size with the mild support was impossible to find after searching 5 different area drug stores. Gratefully, I found them on Amazon and the seller quickly sent them out---I received them in just a few days. I would highly recommend these socks for travel if you are looking for comfort and leg support."
5,Heart be still!,"This artist has real style, the voice of an angel and the looks of a god! Everything about this CD is what I had hoped it would be - I'm really glad I bought it. He really makes the female heart pound - he's a real star and deserves all the credit in the world for his talent. Go get em Tony!"
3,Too Small,"I was a little disappointed in the size. I wanted to use this crock pot to warm up a couple of bowls of soup on trips; however, it is a little bit too small. The ad said it would hold 16 ounces, but it doesn't hold that much."
5,Great little crockpot,"Great for use with dips and hot appetizers. We have used this several times already and it works wonderfully, also handy when entertaining."
4,Handy Pot,I bought this to use with a timer to prepare steel cut oats for my time works very well and easy to clean
2,Mediocre,I thought this would be great for making cake pops...which it is. However it's still sitting on my counter 2 months later - with the chocolate in it - because the inner bowl is not removable. I'm still not clear how to clean it without warming the chocolate first...not to mention how long that will take!
2,"Too small, too hot","I bought this so that I could make steel cut oatmeal overnight. It's too small to make more than one serving, and it runs so hot that the oatmeal browns and dries into a crust. I bought a light timer so that I can start the crockpot in the middle of the night and run it for fewer hours. But even in the space of two hours, the pot can boil over and dry the oats."
4,Cute little bugger...,"I use this product to cook steel cut oats the easier, better way. (Usually it involves standing at the range, stirring for at least 30 minutes.)Before bedtime I spray inside with canola oil, add water, steel cut oats, fruit, oat bran, cinnamon, almonds, etc. put the lid on and plug it into the timer already set up in the outlet.In the morning I have perfectly cooked oatmeal the easy way.Afterward, I put in a few drops of dish washing soap and water to the top to soak all day until I come home from work. Then, it's a wipe and a rinse; very easy to clean.Because the outside heats up, I use an open grate type of hot pad underneath to prevent heat from burning counter, etc.This would rate 4 stars if it had an on/off button and 10 stars if it had a timer and accompanying hot pad. But, I'm happy using my own, separate timer and heat pad until then."
5,Great for making steel-cut oats...,"Despite the fact that this product is made for keeping dips warm, I love it for cooking. I use it every night to cook a serving of steel-cut oats for the next morning. I just set it on a timer, have it come on at midnite and shut off at 6am, add 1/3 cup oats, a pinch of salt, cinnamon and a cup of water, and voilá, breakfast is ready when I get up. Very versatile product, and travels well (make your own breakfast in your hotel room...)"
2,small crock pot,I totally like the size but very disappointed that the crock pot doesn't have a separate pot to take out and wash. It's a pain to try to wash it out and being so careful not to get the bottom and cord wet. Don't use it anymore for that reason.
2,Not practical,"The product looks ok, but not as practical when using it. The plastic cover is really making the food smell bad."
1,broken in 1 year,"it's unfortunate it's no longer heaiting after a year. i was taking a good care of it, so i'm sad. it seems half of the body is warm but the opposit side stay the room tempreture, it's not good. for this price, i guess i have to give it up."
3,Using it for potpourri and essential oils. Just OK.,"This was purchased to warm essential oils in water, and for occasional potpourri, to scent the room. For its purpose it works well enough so far, although no warmer I've found yet has the ability to scent an entire room; I need 2 or 3 warmers (including ""wax tart or candle warmers"") in different locations in one room to do that!The lid is a cheap, thin plastic one. The warmer itself is so-so construction. The cord is only about 2' long, but for the location where used it is fine. The outside of the warmer feels quite warm when on. There is no ""on"" or ""off"" switch, and no ""on"" indicator light.For my purpose I would prefer it to be half the size. For the purpose for which it was intended (sauces) it is OK.As for the price, I don't understand why you can buy a better quality and larger crock-pot for less than the cost of this smaller, cheaply-made one??? Why does smaller cost more????"
4,Very useful,Am very pleased - the heating element keeps dips etc warm without scorching. I bought this one for holiday entertaining and actually received a second one as a gift - I ended up using both of them for parties. Perfect size for small get togethers.
2,Not worth it,"I got his along with a 6 or 7 qt crock pot in a bundle at Costco a few years ago. While the idea is great, the practice is more of a pain then it's worth. It is too small to hold any dip I make and find I can only place about half in at a time, kinda defeats the purpose of keeping dip warm for guests. Also pot does not come out making it harder to clean as it is attached to electrical cord, so you can't really soak stuck on food. I can say it does Orkney to keep dip warm, but overall I don't feel it is worth the hassle and you wold be better off with a 1 qt pot."
3,"If using as ""pickle pot,"" read this","Although the smaller size of the Little Dipper is nice as a pickle pot, I've actually found that the stainless on the side rusts with prolonged exposure to the pickle, and I've actually had this one EXPLODE. I unplugged it, and as it cooled, it created a seal around the edge and it ""sucked"" the lid down. I don't know when it exploded, whether it was as it was cooling or when I heated it back up, but it spewed acid all over my workbench, tools, and on the LCD TV I had over my workbench (it ruined the TV).If you decide on this model, I STRONGLY recommend drilling a small hole in the lid to relieve pressure.Secondly, there is no ""on/off"" switch on this model. I prefer the 2 quart models that have a switch on the front. I always forgot to turn this one off by unplugging it. The ones with the dial are easier to see that you didn't turn it off."
5,Little dipper,"This is exactly what I was looking for. It is to be used as a small pot for hot hide glue (it maintains a temp of 140 degrees, satisfactory for hide glue. It arrived promptly and is in mint condition, Thanks!"
2,Too small for my need...,"Too small for what I bought it for which was for my husband to have heated lunches. He drives a truck and I was hoping he could plug it into the cigarette liter in his truck. However, everything would ""slosh"" out of this tiny thing! And, I tried to find crockpot liners which I could seal, but they are not available for this size pot."
1,This is a laugh!!!!!,"I am the daughter of Daryl Halter.As most people reading this review, you must be a SP fan. When I heard this I didn't realize that Pierre wasn't singing, but when I heard the band playing, {as probally most of us did} I Laugh so hard that it wasn't even funny. I say if you like classical music then you should buy it. If you're a Simple Plan fan then NO WAY.{unless you just want to laugh your head off.}"
5,Great Book,"It is one of the best books to introduce the subject, very easy to read and learn even without instructor, I highly recommend it undergraduate level, in spit of it a little bit expensive but it is worth it."
3,A.A. Allen: A Pentecostal Preacher for the Era,"Showman? Yes. Spiritual? Yes. Practice what he preached? Yes. Proved God's Word to the unbeliever? Yes. a Man of Faith? Yes. Did God work Miracles and Healings through him? Yes.This book has all of that. It's also very uplifting and intended not only to show you his faith and his revivals that he held in just about every major city in our country, but that he was also a MAN first, then a God-led man. He had faults, doubts and fears just like all of us, yet God chose him in spite of all of it. God chooses the weaker vessels to confound the wise. Some of the stories you may find unbelieveable--too hard to believe, yet too hard NOT to believe. Some of the stories you can FEEL God doing the work in the person's life.The book is inspiring. It can lift you up and give you faith to believe that God can STILL and IS STILL doing these things today or not or you can put it down and doubt: that's up to you."
1,Incorrect color pictured,"This product is pictured as white. I received blue and have had no success communicating with the seller, so far.If you don't mind receiving an arbitrary color, then this is a good, cheap swim cap, but there are plenty of other options that probably will arrive as expected."
3,Nice disc to play after a hard workday,"Relaxing, accurate guitarwork. If you really need something to cool down after a hard workday, this might be a good choice. But use this CD carefully, too many days in a row might ruin the good effects. --MAA01605.907271576/online-2.amazon.com--"
1,If You Buy This Windham Hill Petrospective You Will...,"REGRET IT!! I thoroughly regret buying this. The now famous master of Windham Hill Quality, new-age, fame and fortune has laid a goose-egg---a rotten one. After the second track, Processional,The talent drops significantly---It all sounds the same. There is hardly any artistry or composition. It's like Mr. Ackerman(I highly respect his other work though)said,(laughingly)"" I'll bet they buy it because it's me and my picture."" Well, I say 1/2 a star because it's Will and mega ... kudos because the talent is not there---It's a bomb!"
3,Thought Provoking,I have to confess that when it comes to conspiracy theories I am definitely more of a skeptic than a believer. This film however left me grappling with some real questions as to whether there is any truth to all the conspiracy theories I have heard about. It certainly raised some doubt about 911 and how much of what the public knows is actual fact. I didn't actually buy everything presented in the film - particularly the bit about the moon landing being a hoax - but I do think there might be some legitimacy presented in this documentary. Conspiracy theorists will definitely want to check out this film.
3,911 evidence is compelling,"The way the World Trade Center towers actually fell seems so obviously one of those controlled demolitions, and where were the traces of the Boeing 757 in the Pentagon crash? And how did a 757 fit into such a small hole in the Pentagon in the first place? If you haven't heard these questions before, you need to see this film. It's disturbing, and will shake your world to the foundation.Now whether the ""Common Purpose"" group is behind this and all sorts of things, I don't know. And claiming the moon landing was also a hoax seems like over-reaching as well. But the first half of this DVD is certainly worth viewing."
4,Fresh info,I've watched this video a couple of times and will watch again. It has a lot of new info that I hadn't heard before.
3,Terrorists or Aliens--or Both?,This documentary takes on the idea that aliens are controlling us and discusses Gary Cook's book The Protocols of Zion and the movie 9/11: In Plane Site. It covers a lot of bases.
2,Not good!,"I purchased this cookie scoop with much anticipation. Since it was the highest rated scoop I was looking forward to making a hassle free batch of cookies; besides, what could go wrong with such a simple tool? Well...... Unfortunately after the THIRD scoop from my FIRST batch of cookies the mechanism that slides the dough release back and forth skipped, causing the release mechanism to slide well past the edge of the bowl. This effectively caused each scoop of dough to be trapped within the scoop......UGH! After MUCH effort I managed to get the teeth of the mechanism realigned, just to have it happen again! I decided to go back and re-read the product reviews and found that this seems to be a wide spread issue with this design. I have decided to give the Zeroll brand food scoop a try. I am encouraged after reading the reviews, it seems this product doesn't suffer from this design flaw.Until then, happy scooping!"
5,OXO Good Grips Large/Medium Cookie Scoops- Must Have,"Orders arrived in good condition and delivered aspromised on time. I purchased the medium and largeOXO cookie scoops to complete my set since I was giventhe small OXO cookie scoop as a xmas gift this pastyear. I wished I had this scoops this past holidaycookie baking season. Now I can retire my melon ballscoop as this was what I was using to make the cookiedough uniform in size. I can't wait to try out theseOXO scoops and now I can count on OXO cookie scoopsto help me give my cookie baking A+.Thanks, Amazon"
2,Go easy on it,"I used it a couple times... gently because I was wary. Within 5 seconds of my friend using it he immediately destroyed it (knocking the thing off it's track). Wasn't very easy to repair, so I went back to the old school no-frills scooper."
3,Product OK,Picture is deceiving - much small than it looks. Would work good for melon balls. I will buy the large one next time.
5,Gotta Have It!,I have this cookie scoop and the smaller one by OXO Good Grips because they work beautifully. Making cookies (especially chocolate chip for this family) is a breeze to plop the dough on the cookie sheet. I like the medium size scoop more for muffins or if I'm in the mood for larger cookies. Dishwasher safe. Lasts forever. What more could you want? I have my friends using these now too.
2,OX Good Grips Small Cookie Scoop Evaluation,I owned another cookie scoop. It looked of better quality than this one and worked much easier before it broke. It was from Pampered Chef.
1,Hard to squeeze,"Very sturdy and good quality. However, the handle squeeze is much too hard to do. Yes, I'm slight and have small hands and thin wrists.The spring is thick and stiff, a better design would be something with smooth gears that would take the pressure off the user.Men and athletic women may enjoy this item but not for the dainty.I didnt test the flip to see how well it removed dough - didnt want to squeeze it again."
1,Very poor service,The product was good. The company that sells the item is not. Very slow shipping. When purchased it said will have be 2/2 to 2/7. Did not get until much later. Poor communication when contacting them.
2,Oxo Cookie Scoop,Very good quality and value for price. Worked fine for making uniform cookies as well as meat balls.
3,It is an OK scoop,"This is a medium size scoop and I use it strictly for cookies. The first time I used it, I was not that impressed - the squeeeze mechanism seemed to stick and it did not do a good job of getting the dough out of the scoop. I have a small farberware scoop that is much more fluid, and I have no problems with the dough sticking."
3,Great for truffles,"I bought this because I was sick and tired of forming ganache balls for truffles with teaspoons. I wanted something that would form a reasonable ball of refrigerated ganache and then eject it, and this did the trick. When it goes through the dishwasher I have to give it a little extra drying with a paper towel if I want to use it right away, because it doesn't always clean perfectly behind the ejector, but I love this thing. Sturdy and convenient. Additionally, it's a nice size for truffles--this would work for creating either uncovered truffles, or centers for chocolate-dipped truffles.EDITED TO ADD: I used this on an unintentionally harder-than-usual ganache (directly out of the fridge), with unfortunate results; the metal piece that ejects the ball warped. It still functions, but it ain't pretty. I knocked two stars off for fragility."
2,not a real oxo product,"disappointed in the quality of the cookie scoop. I have many oxo products and this is not oxo quality product as I,m used to buying, just because they put an oxo tag on it does not mean its what your expecting to receive. No wheare on the scoop itself does it have oxo written."
1,money thrown in the garbage,it simply got completely disassembled on the very first day of use and as much as I try I can't put it back together. very disappointing.
5,Best for bakers,I have all OXO kitchen gadgets because they are such a great quality product! These cookie scoops are great on the hands and create the perfect cookie shape. I would suggest getting the medium scoop for a normal size cookie and this large one for monster cookies.
4,Great product,"We love this scoop! I bought it to use for cookie baking - my husband likes it for ice cream! It's a little small for ice cream, but perfect for cookies!"
2,Broken the Second Use,"I am a baking lover. I bake and cook ALL THE TIME, several times per week, almost every single day. Bread, cookies, cakes, brownies, blondies, pies, etc. I got this cookie scoop with the idea of making my cookies all the perfect size with ease. The first time I used this scoop was for a batch of chocolate chocolate chip cookies. Awesome. The second time I used this scoop was a few days ago for some oatmeal raisin cookies. Halfway through making this batch, the release unhinged. I tried to put it back together and the spring fell out. I'm disappointed."
1,Broke Within 10 Minutes,"I love the idea of a cookie scoop (and I replaced this one with one from Crate and Barrel for only $2 more that works perfectly), but within minutes of using this one the piece that attaches the handles broke off of the groove and will now the scoop will not stay together. It was extremely difficult to get the metal back on the spokes so it could continue to scoop, and then it would just pop right back out. I tried to use flower wire, tape, etc and nothing would hold it together. It is extremely poorly designed. Spend the extra $2 and get one that is durable and will actually work."
3,not as good,not as good as a basic portion scoop. Cookie dough gets stuck and is hard to release out of it
4,Handy tool for cookie bakers,"I had a cheaper one and it cramped my hands. When I got this one, I was amazed at the difference. It was easier to use and didn't ""lock"" like the cheap ones did. Plus, the dough comes out easier. Also, you don't have to guess whether or not you put enough dough like you do when using the spoon method. Just scoop and drop. Hint: if you want to make smaller cookies, use a spoon to scoop out a little dough from the scooper.I rarely have problems with the scoop, but I once got a blister from using it. In spite of this, I'm happy to have it and it's worth the price."
1,my first cookie scoop ever,"Today was the best day in my baking life, because I received this little thing as my first cookie scoop ever. The grip of this thing was pretty good. I scooped out my first cookie. Yay! Then another one. Double yay! Then as I scooped out the third one, the spring between the handles came out and hit me in the forehead. Ouch! The scoop jumped out of my hand and the poor piece of cookie dough fell on the floor. Well, that's the end of my new cookie scoop."
4,Great Cookie Scoop,This cookie scoop works really well. It is much quicker to scoop the coookies and they turn out more uniform in shape and color.
3,I ended up using two teaspoons,"It works well enough (used it to scoop doughnut batter and cookie dough and it was okay), but ultimately I ended up using two teaspoons. Not necessarily worth having as a specialty item."
4,Not just to make cookies,"Although I originally bought this cookie scoop for cookies, I have been using it to make cocktail size meatballs for parties. It is a pleasure to use and is very helpful in making everything the same size so they cook evenly, whether you are making meatballs or cookies. Like most items in the Oxo Good Grips line, comfortable to hold and use and well constructed."
5,Excellent cookie scoop!!,This is a great cookie scoop for large (about 5in. in diameter) cookies. They are uniform in size and the scoop is easy to use. The rubber handles make it comfortable in the hand especially when making a lot of cookies. I highly recommend this product.
5,very pleased,"I love this so much, I have all the sizes. Fantastic for making cookies, sm meatballs all the same size so cooking time is the same for each cookie, they come out perfect. Don't know how I lived so long with out it!"
1,no longer works!,"the very first time i used this scoop, it broke! the releasing mechanism stopped working, and it fell apart at the hinge. i can put it back together, but every time i squeeze it to release the dough, it falls apart again! its very frustrating, and i dont even use it any more. what a complete waste of money."
5,Best cookie scoops,"I have used these cookie scoops for a few years now. Not just for Christmas cookies. Also, I use the large size one to scoop muffin dough to make uniform muffins. The handles are easy to use, I have arthritis and I find this very handy. If you spray the inside with cooking spray the dough slides right out onto the pan.I own all three sizes and they make my baking easier. I would love to have another small size one for holiday baking. It would make my baking go much faster if I had the extra scoop for a helper to use. In my opinion, these cookie scoops are a ""must have"" for the baker."
3,Not as impressed as I am with my old...,"CRESTWARE scoop. The Crestware scoop is solid and it's 'action' is smooth and quick. The OXO is ok, but it hesitates a lot while scooping. I don't think it will, but it feels as if it is on the verge of breaking sometimes, where the CRESTWARE has always felt secure and steady. Unfortunely, Crestware only makes one size. I am glad I got the OXO medium size scoop at Kohls with a $10 off $10 coupon. So I guess I got what I paid for..."
1,It broke the first time I used it.,The scooper broke with the first scoop. I wish I was one of the many others who have had no problems but I think I'm going to try a different brand.
5,Food Scoopers Rule!,"Everything OXO produces is of the highest quality available for such a great price.Food scoopers are essential in my kitchen. This is OXO's smallest available here (I believe by measurement standards it's a #100) and is great for small cookies and mini muffins.Once you get used to portioning batters and doughs with these, you will want them in a variety of sizes, and they will quickly become essential in your kitchen, as well."
1,Broke after first scoop.... :(,"I ordered this scoop to make small cookies for whoopie pies. Upon testing it this morning, I scooped one cookie and then tried to scoop another and the scoop broke apart. Wish I was one of the many who had zero problems with it."
5,A great disher (buy the large),"Dishers are one of those things where it seems like the cheapest one in the store would get the job done. After breaking a few I've reconsidered. This is a great one so far. It's high enough quality to scoop even chilled dough. The sweep has enough clearance from the bowl that the whole thing is easy to get clean.My one observation: a medium is a bit on the small side, if you are making cookies. I am going to keep my medium but order a large to go with it."
1,inadequate release mechanism,"OXO usually makes well thought out products but they haven't improved on the cookie scoop at all unless you count the comfy handle. I bought an OXO cookie scoop last year to help make evenly sized cookies. The thin metal device that is supposed to release the dough from the scoop twisted and bent when working with chilled dough. Once the metal was bent the scoop was completely useless. Ever the optimist I bought another OXO this year since all others I found were plastic. Unfortunately the same thing happened this year although it waited until the fifth batch of dough instead of the third before it crumpled up. Gee, maybe next year I'll get seven batches out before the thing twists and bends! My opinion: comfy handles don't count when the release mechanism is made so cheaply it is useless."
4,Great cookie scoop!,I got this cookie scoop in red at target for a comparable price. it is great of cookie dough as well as CAKE BALLS! I make cake balls a lot for various functions and this makes it so much easier. thanks OXO!
4,Oxo cookie scoop,"I received this as a gift and have used it successfully over the last 2 years. This cookie scoop is Excellent!! I used it during my Christmas cookie present baking this past season, and it made the the process a breeze!! The slowest part has always been the cleanup and trying to do uniform scoops onto the sheets. I highly recommend it!!"
3,Great While Worked...,"I bought this to make cookie preparations for Thanksgiving easier. When it worked, it worked great, and allowed me to easily scoop the cookie dough from the bowl. I was able to scoop about 5 dozen cookies (in one day), and then the scoop got caught, sort of like a zipper. I was able to fix it, and continue using it. However I don't think it should have broken so fast and after just one day of use, even if it was used to scoop 5 dozen cookies. I am not sure how long it'll last though..."
5,Awesome!,"I love this scoop. I can't compare it to other scoops, other than a cheapo plastic one (Wilton I believe) that broke the 2nd cookie I scooped, but it works like a dream!Seems sturdy and well made, so I'm expecting it to stick around for a while!"
4,Great scoop,Bought this for Christmas cookie making. Got tired of guesstimating and getting the stuff from the spoon to the sheet. FAST work of doling out the dough.
1,Broke upon First Use,"The reviews sounded great - and I knew I loved my Pampered Chefs cookie scoop - so I gave this scoop as a Christmas gift. Mistake. I've just learned the scoop broke the first time it was used. The weld broke. And, to top it off, I'm past the return window. Frustrating. Embarrassing. Garbage."
4,"Great for cookie dough, but horrible for ice cream","I've been using the 2 teaspoon size scoop for a couple years now for cookies - the small scoop makes cookies that are small enough that I can grab a few without feeling like I've just overindulged. It's been working great, even with cold chocolate chip cookie dough.Today, however, I tried to use it to scoop ice cream to put into some profiteroles. The ice cream was too cold and twisted and warped the dough release arm completely by the third scoop. Definitely do not use it for anything too cold/grabby, it'll break the scooper pretty easily."
4,The scraper leaves dough behind,"Initially I purchased the cookie scoop to use on chocolate truffles. I bought the medium sized cookie scoop, which is to large to make truffles with. The chocolate is really soft and melts so easily that half of the truffle would still be in the scoop.The cookies are great. They are even, which is great for baking. The only problem I have is that the scraper leaves dough in the scoop (if i wasn't a little crazy this wouldn't bother me at all). I love acquiring kitchen toys, even though I still mostly use two spoons to bake my cookies with this was a good purchase. This cookie scoop is a good addition to any bakers kitchen."
3,Broke on first use,"Great idea, but the craftsmanship leaves something to be desired. I bought this to use with cookies for the holidays. On the first recipe I used it, I was disappointed to find that the peg holding one of the black handle covers broke off. Now the black cover wiggles a lot when I squeeze to release the scooped contents. Not happy about that!"
2,Oxo Medium Cookie Scoop,"I purchased this item 5 months ago. I do not like at all the fact that one of the plastic handle covers came loose while I was scooping the batter & dropped off hard plastic pieces in my cookie dough! Luckily, it was a light colored batter, so I was able to see the black plastic pieces before I scooped them up. I purchased both the medium & large Oxo scoop because I thought they were quality items, but this experience has changed my viewpoint. I will be replacing them both with stainless scoops without plastic parts that may potentially drop off into my food."
1,Broke after 6 months,"This was a great cookie scoop. I had the small and used it to make my small cookies (rather than massive cookies that you can buy at a bakery). I was using it in some chilled cookie dough when the mechanism came off the track. My husband fixed it while I did the rest of the cookies by hand. When I tried it again later, it came off the track again. My husband fixed it again. It broke again. We gave up and threw it in the trash. We weren't using it in anything thicker/colder than ice cream, so it shouldn't have broken so easily."
2,works - but doesn't!,"I just gave one of these to my wife as an early christmas present and on the first scoop the gear at the bottom nudged up a bit and the lever got dislodged. It appears that the rod the gear is on can move about 1/8"" up and the lever cannot... so depending on the angle of which you squeeze, the whole thing stops working. I'm sure there's a way to bend something back in to place - but I've never seen it working, so I'm not sure what's really wrong with the design... seems flawed."
1,OXO Good Grips Cookie Scoop,"The release mechanism stopped working the second time I used this - essentially became useless after that point. OXO usually has quality products, but not this one."
5,"small=melon baller, medium=cookies, large=muffin & ice cream","I actually already had the small scoop and the large scoop by OXO and just recently ordered this in the medium scoop from Amazon. These are very well made and my others have lasted years.The small one makes perfect tea cookies or melon balls for fruit salad. The large one is great for ice cream scooping or 4 to 5"" lg mega cookies such as whoopie pies, and the medium is a perfect normal sized cookie scooper.The spring mechanism works smoothly and we use these often and wash in the dishwasher each time. They have held up with no issues and make baking and other kitchen scooping faster and less messy.No negatives...we've had no problems with ours.As an aside, I did find the large size at TJ Maxx for a couple bucks less. But then again, I paid tax so it probably winds up almost the same as Amazon. But if you need some in a pinch and need them fast, they often carry OXO."
5,Good For Cupcakes Too,"I purchased the large (aprox 3 Tbsp) and the small (aprox 2 tsp) scoops a couple weeks ago. I make a lot of cupcakes, and these have completely changed my baking. I use the large one for regular size cupcakes and the small for minis. Depending on the batter, I use slightly more or less than a full scoop, but it is so easy to portion out and scoop the batter into the muffin tins. Plus, it's much faster, easier, and cleaner than my old way of using a measuring cup or a pastry bag. For liquidy batters, it's a little more difficult, but it's still better than any of my old methods.This will help me create evenly sized cookies too. Evenly sized baked goods (cupcakes or cookies) will cook evenly in the oven, meaning everything will be done at the same time. No more will I have some overdone and some underdone. I can't believe I didn't purchase these long ago."
1,Dont waste your money,i love oxo products however this cookie scoop is terrible. the dough does not come out you have to squeeze the handle like 100 times then use a spoon. what a waste!
1,Can't handle thicker doughs,"This scoop cannot release thicker doughs properly. The handles bend, causing the gears to skip and become mis-aligned. I bought 3 sizes and they all have the same problem."
5,Love this thing,"I could kick myself for not buying this and the medium sized scoop sooner. I thought it was a silly luxury. Well, it's a necessity if you want uniform baked cookies. I also use them to measure portions for muffins, ********, desserts - all kinds of things. The action is as smooth as BUTTER. I'm going to get the small one to use for portions on canapes and for flavored butters. I'm sure I'll find other uses while I'm at it."
5,works great,"Just in time for Christmas baking, nice sturdy scoop. Had a Pampered Chef one and it broke, so went with Oxo."
4,Great cookie size for kids!,"Very pleased with the Oxo Good Grips Small Cookie Scoop. Perfect size cookie for taking to meetings or functions.When filled to the top and scraped level, it makes about a 2 inch diameter cookie.The only down side( and reason for 4 star rating) is that if your cookie dough warms up too much the scoop does not release well at all. So keep batter chilled for best results."
3,"Okay, but sweeper pops out too easily","It feels good in your hand and seems well made. However, in normal use the sweeper pops out of the spoon. I've manage to get it back by brute force, but it is annoying. For the record, this medium scoop is a #40 / 1.5T."
2,It broke,"I used the disher maybe three times. The first couple times were on soft batters for cakes and muffins. The final time was on a batch of chocolate chip cookie dough. It broke like other reviews said it would. I thought it could be fixed but we couldn't manage it. My husband threw it away before I had a chance to return it.Not an overly specific review but its been a few months since it broke, sorry."
5,Amazing utensil- a definate for any cookie baker,"I love this cookie scoop, and use it every time I make cookies of any kind. Peanut butter, chocolate chip, sugar, oatmeal-rasin. Nearly all of the cookies I make require the 'drop by rounded teaspoon' and I was so tired of having different sized cookies and getting messy in the process from rounding the dough. The small size scoop is 2 tsp. and the perfect size for a 2"" cookie. The handle is amazing, the gears don't stick, and the piece that pushes the dough out works every time. There is a film of cookie dough left after, as with any other cookie scoop, but clean-up is amazing! I never use the dishwasher on it because I love it so much, I don't want it damaged in anyway, but if you wash it after use it is incredibly easy to clean with regular dish soap and a wash cloth! I have not used the other sizes, but I highly recommend this scoop for snack-sized cookies!"
5,great product,"sturdy, dish washer safe ,makes perfect size cookies or for whoopie pies, creats a uniform size. wish i had purchased sooner, also has multi purpose, and stiil an ice cream scoop too!!!"
4,Good Scoop,Good product. As described and very sturdy. The handle is easy to grip and offers some resistance but not so much that my hands get tired. Great for making cookies.
4,Very Nice Pink Leather Laptop Briefcase,"I looked for a Pink Leather laptop carrier for at least 2 years and finally decided on this McKlein USA Deerfield Pink Leather case.It is good quality Pink Italian leather, with shoulder length straps, and fits my 10 1/2"" X 14"" laptop. This was difficult to find, because most of the carriers I considered were made for a smaller laptop. This one has two separate compartments, which also allows room to carry the adapter cord and mouse, if you use one. It also has room for a few thin files, pens/pencils, and a phone.I would like it better if the handles were a rolled leather style, and it had a removable leather laptop sleeve. That's why I gave it only 4 stars. Otherwise, it is a beautiful pink leather carrier and I feel good carrying it."
5,Comprehensive Users Guide,"This is not for programmers but is for administrators and Mambo users. Very complete. Covers a lot of things I did not know (and I have used the system for quite a while). By far the most complete work on the subject. Covers the newest version as well, including the new editor. Well worth it -- and long overdue! Thanks!"
3,terrible English,"The authors of this book need to seriously study English before they write anything more. While it's easy to say that you should over look poor or unusual grammar and concentrate on the content this is so bad it makes it hard to read. They also need to learn the difference between a proper noun and common noun, this leads to a weird outbreak of capital letters throughout the book making sentences even harder to read; eg section and category are not proper nouns and should not be capitalized."
5,Best cleanse,"I've tried a million cleanses and this is by far the best one I've tried. More expensive, multiple pill formulas, liquids, morning/noon/night pill packs, all of it. And this simple little pill once a day really works the best. I lose the pooch and feel much better after a few days, it's the only product that I actually feel better after taking. Highly recommended!"
2,Math Book or Evil Book?,"I own this book and use it everday in my Pre-Calculus class. I like the way the book uses examples, it is very helpful to the reader. Yet, the book has some faults. The book does not keep a consistent pattern of how they like their answers. In the back, there are the answers to the odd problems. More often than not, those answers are either wrong or in no way helpful. The book goes through different concepts much too rapidly for comprehension. Each section is practically totally different from the previous one and only in several instances does it have anything to do with the chapter as a whole. The book is informative and well organized, though, and is better than some others I have seen. Overall, I will rate it with a score of two stars for it's lack of consistency, user-friendliness, and evil."
4,loved the exercises in this book,"As my heritage is Russian and I am also a Pagan, I enjoyed reading this book. Many of the excercises given in the book were enjoyable as well. I liked Johnson's story-telling style of his personal journey throughout. Those readers who do energy work will relate to some of the healing methods explored."
4,"Very interesting, very different","Very interesting album, good to hear the tunes sung in Welsh instead of English. I like many of the songs and the delivery of most of them. I guess that I'm what might be called a traditionalist in that I would like to hear something with a traditional sound, this one is good but very modern. Probably most Enya listeners will find something to like here although I'd say she's closer to the past in her styling."
5,Something Enchanting,"I can listen to this CD beginning to end, over and over and not get tired of it. Such beautiful melodies and vocals will never become tiring. Sounding very much like Enigma and Enya, with perhaps a bit more Celtic mythology and influence thrown in, Ceredwen (pronounce KER-ed-wen) creates a masterpiece. Everyone should own a copy of this CD, if not to listen to for pleasure, to put on as background music to relax to. No need to delay--this CD should be in your player today!"
5,One of my all time favorites,"First purchased this little gem back in '97. Lost it in a move and it was sorely missed. Love it from the first note til the thundering hoof beats at the end. Relaxing, Uplifting. A melodic journey for your soul. A must have for any fan of Celtic music... Give it a listen. You won't be sorry!"
5,Great Instructional Serve Video,"In my humble ( as I'm still working on my serve!) this is a really good instructional video for the tennis serve. It is detailed, yet coherent, and very clearly presented. I highly recommend it."
2,Helpful for those that bring plenty of previous experience,"As long as you come equiped with the appropriate technical background to hit the ground running, this book will serve its purpose. Otherwise, you'll be better off finding a book that provides a more through review of the basics."
4,Win. Command-Line,The book arrived on time and in the expected condition. The only complaint I have is the fact that the book is based on the Xp operating system. I would have liked for this to have been stated more clearly in the description.
2,very lacking,you would think with a title like administrator in the name it would cover more.found it lacking in some very basic commands like cacls
4,Solid sampler of what Yo La Tengo does.,"This EP is a good introduction to YLT's musical diversity (for people who are not familiar with the band) while providing longtime fans with three things at which these musicians are incredibly skilled -- beautiful originals, solid covers and reinventions of their own songs.YLT's catchy pop melodies are solid, whether they redo them by bumping them up a notch (the EP's title song, from this year's Summer Sun) or stripping them way down (""Cherry Chapstick"", from 2000's And then nothing turned itself inside-out). Beyond YLT's original tunes, the most beautiful and touching song on this EP is the lullaby-like cover of Bert Jansch's ""Needle of Death.""Overall, this EP might be short, but it shows a breadth of musical styles and is a cheap introduction to the music if you've never heard them before, or an interesting take on some previously-released songs for those who have."
1,Very poor quality seat,I was very happy when I got the seat however very disappointed when I installed it. Its very poor quality. I could not believe they make you install the snaps for their cushions. Once installed 2 of the snaps to the rear of the seat ripped right out of the cushion the first time I used it. I should have know better than to buy such a cheap seat as it obviously lacks any quality.
4,Basic & Essential,"This book is great that in that it has a large color photo for nearly every recipe. The recipes are varying in scope to some extent but annoying in that the author chose to make different pages for variations to the same recipes such as croquettes (ham/seafood/vegetable) so this makes me feel that he was trying to ""up"" the recipe count with minimal effort.All in all, recommended for a ""basic"" tapas cookbook."
3,Okay but not great.,I felt most of the dishes take too long to prepare and make. I think these recipies are for a person with better than average cooking skills and not cooking for a family of 4 after a hard days work. Most of the mushroom dishes are delicious: just the right amount of flavor if you follow the instructions.
5,"A Reading Of ""The Windhover""","Length:: 4:01 MinsI truly did not know until after selecting this poem that it was Hopkins' own favourite. It's a quite short, unconventional poem, and therefore I have taken the liberty of providing background to it in the video."
1,Day-Timer Organizer 2000,"I started using DTO 2k in 1997. It is an excellent program with a lot of perks. Until now (Feb 2003) I would consider it a 5 star plus program. However I've dumped it because the Day-Timer company no longer supports the program. Therefore, Day-Timer is a dead end unless some other enterprizing software company takes it over. Hopefully that will happen. Until that time I will use another organizer that is Palm compatible, namely, Palm Desktop."
4,Excellent quality,This company makes fine products. I have not bought anything from them that I was dissapointed in; including this series of wooden spoons. Highly recommend!
5,Good Buy,"I was surprised at the bargain buy I got on thos leather bag. It was well worth the purchase. You know the old saying you get what you pay for, but in this case its true. I would recommend this leather bag to anyone looking for an item like this with a low cost."
4,Bag not as Pictured...,"The bag I received from ""Lilgift"" Fulfilled by amazon was not as pictured, you could say the bag I received was more of a huge Gym/duffel bag, the leather was similar to the picture but the bag was nothing like it in size. Also the strap was different. I returned the item as what I needed was a tote/shoulder bag similar to a laptop bag for teaching. However I give it 4 stars as the bag seemed to be of good quality."
1,Strap breaks on first use,"Extremely disappointed in this bag. It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet. On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home. Also, the stitching is coming loose. Also the strap is not leather. A big waste of money."
1,Poor quality,"I should have expected inferior quality for the price. The outside of the bag was pretty nice, but the strap was poor quality. The interior of the bag was unacceptable to me. The main compartment was not fully lined, and I could see the stitching of the pen holders that were in the compartment the other side of the main compartment. The seller was good about communicating for the return that was made about 2 wks. ago, but I still have not received my refund. It was not worth the price of shipping to make the return. The cost of shipping for the item, and the cost of shipping to return, were about the cost of the item."
5,Nice bag!,"Very nice bag, especially considering the price. Has a patchwork design sewn with multiple leather pieces, which looks good. Many compartments which allow plenty of room to carry a number of different items. I can fit an IPad in one section a 35 mm camera in another and have plenty of room for a number of other envelopes, papers whatever. I think it would have been nice if the shoulder strap were a bit longer, but it still works well. I am used to a longer strap on my previous shoulder bag, but after using this it is not really a problem. I would recommend this item."
4,good introductory ethics book...,"Need this book for ethics class. Book is very easy to understand, way better than other ethics books I have read."
2,Very lightweight book,I found this book to be very lightweight -- anyone with experience with the Web or with Web design will find little here that is not common sense. Very disappointing.
3,"Cute, but loud and pricey","My two sons get a kick out of this toy, but I wish it weren't so darned loud. It's also on the expensive side for what it is--I agree with the other reviewer who said there could've been more bells and whistles, especially for a show that's supposed to be geared toward educating older toddlers."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I wish I had read the reviews BEFORE purchasing this piece of junk! When my husband and I saw it in the store, it looked so cute, and we loved the demo. Well, once we bought it and got it home and out of the box, the real play was just as short as the demo! You literally have to keep squeezing his foot every 10 seconds to keep him going. I don't know about your kid, but mine refuses to do this. She'd rather just ignore the Boohbah and play with something more entertaining. Plus, even when you do press the button every 10 seconds, he basically does the same thing over and over. Not much variety at all! Buyer beware - RIP OFF!"
1,BOOBAHS ARE ALIVE!,I woke up in the middle of the night screaming because a boobah was standing over me with a knife. I screamed as it sang BOOBAH BOOBAH BOOBAH over and over and over and over and over and over and over! AH! Its scary! My dog had a heart attack when he/she saw this. However the education is really high you won't beleive how educational this toy is.
2,Are You Kidding Me?,"I can't believe people are actually buying these things. It's HILARIOUS, but not for the reason you'd expect. No, it's because of what these things LOOK like...I mean, seriously, people...LOOK AT IT! It looks bad enough, but what it DOES is even more disturbing. On the moving, talking ones, you push their hand. So it sings ""boooooohbaaaaaah"" in this really CREEPY voice, and then it sits down and FARTS (I'm SERIOUS), and a song begins to play and it starts swiveling its head like something you'd see in an adult shop.It's even worse than the vibrating Harry Potter broomstick toy that caused such a controversy a few years ago. This thing looks...well, just LOOK AT IT!"
3,"Roaring Glory Warbirds, Vol. 7; Vought F4U Corsair",This DVD is okay. There are a lot better. There is excellent footage of one museum piece Corsair flying. The narrator is also very good at explaining the preflight and technology behind this aircraft. The attempt to make new footage look old appears cheap and phoney. It is very clear that the actors are not professional; obvious that they are reading a script. This DVD also lacks in providing much historical footage or detail. The little provided is very sketchy and not conclusive. If you are looking for a great DVD on the F4U Corsair you will probably be disappointed in this one.
5,Incredible!,"This DVD is one of the best values a World War II enthusiast can find! Included is not only a full color flight session in your favorite WWII warbird, but the original training film and a full, printable manual. This DVD not only tells you what the plane can do, but this DVD teaches you how to fly it! If you have any interest in WWII aviation, buy this DVD!"
2,Just fair--and disappointing,"The whole Roaring Glory series is only fair. While the modern-day, restored aircraft footage is pretty good, the audio quality is awful. At times the ambient engine noise is so loud that you have difficulty understanding the pilot's words as he's describing a sequence. That's just plain poor audio engineering.The series can be rented from Netflix. I was truly disappointed in all of these titles."
1,Poor Quality for a Flag,"The flag I received had the stitching unraveling. It also has a tag on it that says ""Made in Taiwan"". This is not made in USA as the description states."
1,Single sided,I had purchased this flag previously from Valley Forge. I was expecting the same product which was a two sided flag. This flas is not. Printed on only one side which looks very poor hanging from my flag pole. Very disappointed.
4,Good Price,The flag is nice but remember that its nylon so it will not last an extreamly long time on a outdoor flag pole but for the price I can buy a few per year and not have that huge out of pocket expense.
5,This is a keeper,I have been reading this book for 4 years and it has changed my life. A truly beneficial tool for deepening spiritual practice.
3,Surprisingly good read,"Honestly, I found this book on the shelf of a restaurant library of an abandoned restaraunt we were converting into a haunted house. I was playing a ghost, behind this plexiglass thing and anyway it got pretty dull between groups and I started reading this book, eventually stealing it.Anyway, I was expecting it to be horrible, because it seemed like the sort of place where bad books go to die, but I found myself actually caring about the characters and interested in seeing what happens next and stuff. It's an interesting look at relationships and how they change over time and how they stay the same. It's not your typical cookie-cutter romance where the two people were obviously meant to be together forever, which is nice."
5,Incredibly Inspiring,"I'm sure there are Christians out there, who like me, look for relevance and inspiration in their religious study. Craig Barnes is by far the most effective preacher I've seen, and his writings communicate the meanings of scripture in ways that seem to transcend the English language. For me, this book, ""Hustling God,"" and ""When God Interrupts"" have been instrumental in getting through tough times. Some of the other (5 star) reviewers have said it better than I can. While some of his earlier writings are a bit more ""intellectual,"" I cannot recommend his books enough."
4,great topic,I am a widow and have been questioning my faith as I struggle to remain on this earth without my precious husband. Mr Barnes tackles a great subject which I totally relate to at this time. Read it slowly.
5,I could not put this book down!,"Fascinating information about the financial lives of many famous people! If you are interested in the rich and famous, this book is for you. I read lots of technical books. This book was a nice diversion... very easy and extremely enjoyable to read."
5,Wonderful,This is how measuring cups should be.The only thing I would change is to make them microwave safe.So much easier to measure you don't have to turn your head in every direction to see if it is on the line no bending.GREAT GREAT product.Another great item that Alton Brown uses
4,another combination of cups is more useful,"I think these measuring cups are the best liquid measures ever invented. The set of 4-cup, 2-cup, 1-cup is not as useful as a set of 2-cup, 1-cup, mini would be. I cook for 6 - 8 people every night and I don't use the 4 cup. It's very easy to fill the 2-cup twice. I would purchase them separately to get what I need. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer them all through their site."
4,"Great concept, works well, one minor flaw","I bought this set of three about 10 months ago, and LOVE the concept. MUCH easier to use than conventional measuring cups. The only minor flaw is that the numbers/markings are wearing off in some places and seem to get scratched off easily too. It's not so bad that I can't use the cups, but I can see that it could become a problem in the future. Even so, I would purchase these again -- I'm considering buying a second set because I use them so much!"
4,Easier to measure,"My neice had these and I liked the idea of being able to see how much was in the measuring cup by looking down versus having to either hold the cup up or crouch down to counter level to look on the side for the amount in the cup. I have found the measures are not precise though. For example, when it shows 1/2 cup looking down, it will show a little more or less when you look at it from the side. For most of my cooking that's not a big deal. For someone who needs very precise measures, I would recommend checking both and use the side measure as your final authority. They stack awkwardly due to the handles but they do stack. Overall pleased but they could use some improvements in accuracy and stacking design."
1,DO NOT MICROWAVE,"If you try to microwave any liquids (broth, butter, etc) in these the plastic bubbles up and melts. I am concerned that the plastic may end up in whatever you end up meeting. I'll stick with Pyrex from here on."
5,LOVE these!,"I got these to replace my old set which wasn't very good. (all the markings had washed or rubbed off even though we didn't have a dishwasher when I had them) This are awesome! I love the design of these, the way they stack and the way you can see how full it is by looking inside it. I think the best part is they are dishwasher safe, so I don't have to worry about the numbers coming off!"
2,Great until they crack and leak.,"I have had this set for several years and replaced two of the three cups at least once. Each cup eventually develops a crack in the bottom where the mold indentation is, then they start to leak at the crack. I stopped using them for hot liquids to no avail. They go in the top rack of my dishwasher. They have never been in the microwave. They use is so limited now I can't justify keeping them anymore. Currently two of the cups have cracks again. I will not be repacing them with OXO measuring cups, I've learned my lesson. OXO = great design concept, but poor quality."
4,All things in Good Measure,"These are really great liquid measuring cups! I picked them up as part of a 4 for 3 promotion, just an add on to some things I really wanted/needed. Well, they are one of the best impulse purchases I have made in quite some time! Being able to look down into the cup and ascertain proper measure is certainly a good deal easier than the stoop and peer at the side I have been doing for years. It is also more reliable than the quick, pick it up and glance at the side I do when I am in a rush. The handles on the cups are also nice. They grip well and make pouring a breeze. The cups appear to be well constructed and I have thrown them in the dishwasher several times already and they have come out fine, so far. If there are any issues with etching or fading I will update this review.Recommended."
2,Not for the long run,"The bottom line is these are polycarbonate measuring cups. The issues with polycarbonate besides the possible health concerns with BPA, is that it tends to crack with use. Definitely don't use these in your dish washer as it will cause them to develop cracks. One of mine actually started leaking today and it is only a couple years old. I would expect a measuring cup to last a life time. I won't be buying these again.Pros:Easy to read measurements.Convenient sizesCons:Polycarbonate (both BPA and can crack/leak)Pouring can be a challenge, don't go to fast or you will make a messBottom Line:Avoid these and get glass or a food safe BPA free plastic that will also be more durable."
3,Eh,"These cus measure but if you are putting anything in them except water, it is a pain to get all of it out. The inside ring makes it impossible to to use a spatula to get everything out. I end up washing it out or using another measuring cup for every step in a recipe"
5,Bang for the Buck,This cost a couple bucks more than another set I was looking at and I am very glad I paid the extra. Saw the one set I almost got at a department store and started second guessing my order. Then I got these babies. Much thicker and heavier duty construction not to mention a unique inside measuring/labeled indicator. You want the bad boys of measuring cups then look no further.
4,Measure everything,"I really like these measuring cups vs the pyrex ones. These are easy to read and clean up. The handles make it difficult to store, but not any worse than the glass ones. I wish all of the numbering were in red instead of black - red is easier to read when you have them on a dark counter. Overall, I love these and have purchased them as gifts for others. I use the one cup and the four cup most often, but the 2 cup one does come in handy"
2,Knuckleheaded pour spouts,"We got these for our wedding 5 years ago. They looked cool at BBB, but we've always been disappointed at the way they pour. If you want to pour at a speed anywhere between a dribble and a dump you're out of luck. It just runs down the side of the cup.Why don't measuring cups have a good pour spout? This isn't just with these cups, we have some glass Pyrex ones too, and they're worse. My French press pours well, and my inlaws have a good pouring plastic measuring cup, so I know it's not just my pouring technique. We've finally decided to replace them, so here we are on Amazon, browsing the measuring cups.Btw, the one cup size cracked a year ago, but the other two are still holding liquid, although with lots of visible cracks."
1,Too bad so sad,"When I first received this set of measuring cups I wrote a stellar 4 star review about them. My primary reason for buying them was because I needed a good quarter cup measure. Secondarily, I liked and still like the design of these measuring cups.My previous 1/4 cup measuring cup was not accurate. When filled, to the level it provided too much content (i.e., it held more than 1/4 cup so it wasn't accurate). So, my first trial of this set was to use the one cup piece and measure 1/4 cup of water. I did that and then I poured the water into my other measuring cup that I knew was inaccurate and it OVERFILLED it. So this OXO held even more content than my existing on.The title of my review is appropriate because I really liked these but I'm disappointed because I need to return them and search for a better one which is a bit of a hassle. Fortunately the merchant I bought this set from uses fulfillment by Amazon so the return will be relatively easy."
5,tossing the old ones,"These are fantastic. Not familiar with the brand but liked the engineering of a measuring cup for heaven's sake. They did a lot for us in these cups. Great handles, You can see inside measures and outside. I'mvery happy"
4,"""OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF BABES........""","H. Jackson Brown's phenomenal bestseller, ""Life's Little Instruction Book"" was steady on the New York Times list for over two years. A compilation of some 500 simple but true suggestions for a happy and satisfying life, the small volume sold more than 6 million copies.Then, Brown turned his attention to the observations of children, ages four to 17, or ""The Peanut Butter Gang."" Consider, ""Guests is just another word for cleaning. Chanelle, Age 12."" Or, ""If your sister hits you, don't hit her back. Parents always catch the second person. Michael, Age 10.""In addition to children's sayings, the slim volume is decorated with colorful drawings and includes pertinent quotations from the likes of Harry S. Truman and Aristotle.""Wit and Wisdom from the Peanut Butter Gang"" will bring smiles of recognition from parents and grandparents alike. It simply proves what we've always said, ""Out of the mouths of babes.....""- Gail Cooke"
4,not what most people would expect,Interesting take on what would happen to society when intelligent life is found and contacted.After watching this I can see why the government would want to cover up such a discovery.
2,A SILLY MOVIE,"DESPITE THE CRAZY EFFECTS, THIS HAS SOME GOOD ACTING. SINCE IT'S A CULT CLASSIC IT HAS SOME GOOD ACTORS ESPECIALLY PETER GRAVES"
5,Uplifting and Inspirational,"In these early days of the 21st Century, Christianity is of dubious cache among the semi-educated literati of America. Phoo on them all!""Red Planet Mars"" is an inspiring SF vision of the Christian ethic, from a time when atheistic Communism was known for what it was--60 million dead at Stalin's hand, liars and traitors in the US (The Hollywood 10, Julius & Ethel Rosenberg, Alger Hiss, ""Col."" House and more), and there really was a secret plot to overthrow the United States!This movie, born in that time or confusion and fear, shows that Christ's simple lessons work even in a nuclear world. To those bigots out there who despise Christianity, or those ostrich-like intellectuals who still believe in the innate goodness of Communism, GET A LIFE! The rest of the world ought to see this great film."
1,Sci-Fi or Sermon,"As a fan of classic and not so classic science fiction of the fifties, I wanted to like this, if only for the title alone. Spoiler alert, but all through this movie I kept expecting rationality to triumph. No such luck.The movie trundles along well enough and might have been bearable as a typical pot-boiler but the ""message"" ending made me gag. As far as I'm concerned, other then the occasional casual reference, science fiction and religion don't mix.Some might call it an interesting examination of the differences or commonality different viewpoints but any plot that explains everything away by the ""god did it"" answer is just a massive failure. Keep your sermons in you church, thank you."
4,God Intervenes...,"A Sci-fi movie that moves you. Mankind will destroy itself, without some messages from God! Will WE LISTEN???"
4,Vesuvius will blow you away!,"Frank Tichelli wrote all the orchestral pieces on this CD - they are all lively and engaging, but the best one is Vesuvius - fantastic parts for all the instruments including percussion - you will feel as though you are watching the volcano erupt with this music playing."
1,Piece of junk.,I wish I would have read the reviews on this product before I purchased it. It is a piece of junk. I used it twice. The second time I used it it wouldn't grate the cheese and it made a clicking sound when I turned the handle and then the handle broke off. What a waste of money. Makes me think very differently about Good Grips products. One more thing - it wasn't very comfortable to use which I thought the Good Grips products were supposed to be.
3,Not so Grate!,I bought this recently and was so excited that I would find something to grate my hard cheeses without scraping my knuckles. It worked very slowly and my wrist hurt after having to put so much pressure on the cheese. The rotary blade is not as sharp as it could be and cleaning it is a chore. I own other Oxo products and love them. This I can live without.
3,Don't Invite King Kong to Dinner,"This item gets the job done - provided nobody forces it. Turning the handle backwards releases a jam, but leave it to Godzilla to push the handle just as hard as he could. Also, the little plastic cover is clear and got lost almost immediately. They should make the cover bright red so it won't be thrown away by mistake. However, if you are very careful, the grater should work for quite some time. Remember to put the little drum cover aside somewhere when you bring the grater to the table. Your guests will NOT be careful with it."
3,Works great while it lasts,"We had the same experience as some other reviewers... It worked great for a few months, comfortable to use, efficient, nice feature lets you store the cheese in the grater, can go straight into the diswasher. It really was better that any other rotary grater we've had, and lasted longer too. My kids love freshly grated Parmesan cheese so we grate about 1/2-3/4 pound at a time to use for the week. This past weekend, the little black part of the handle just broke. I looked for a way to fix it, but it basically useless now. Time to look for a new one. At least it is only $15."
2,Great while it lasts (not long!),"Works great while it lasts - I've owned 2, and none made it past 2 months. The plastic breaks if the cheese is a little hard - and since I mostly use it for parmesan cheese, and that can be hard at the crust, it's not a good thing..."
2,Poor guarantee,The rotary grater works very well and easy to clean. The black knob on the handle broke off. I have also heard this happening to two other people. No replacement handle is avaiable. The whole grater must be sent in for a replacement. This is a hassle when it should not be a problem for them to simply send a new handle.
2,"High maintenance, poor performance on soft cheese","So far I've had a good experience with Oxo products, but this one is a big disappointment. It really can only be used to finely grate hard cheeses. Any softer cheese (such as cheddar), even if briefly frozen, will be just smeared over the drum, stuck everywhere and will come out in a long rope, as one of the reviewers observed.But it's not the worst part. I absolutely hate the design with the handle screwed on top of the drum and has to be reattached for every cleaning. With other graters it is possible to see inside the drum while grating and to make a quick adjustment, if necessary. To detach the handle you have to put your finger inside the drum and press it against the sharp blade (!!!). The drum is very difficult to clean - the inside is narrow and any soft cheese gets stuck very badly. If you put it in a dishwasher, dirty water will collect in the crevice where handle is attached to the drum. It's too high maintenance for such a simple device."
1,Not Impressed,I bought a few of these for my restaurant and they lasted about a week before they broke. In addition for the short time we were able to use them they were very hard to use. Do not recommend sorry.
1,Stay away,"This grater has a severe design flaw. The cheese gets either stuck or lumps between the housing and the grating drum, preventing you to grate the cheese. If you keep trying,the handle breaks away from the drum. Mine fell off just after a few weeks."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!,"The third time I used this sorry excuse for a kitchen gadget, the handle broke off. My use thus far had been to grate enough parmesan cheese over our prepared plates - it's not like I had grated an entire block. The cheese gets stuck between the drum and the casing, and then the entire casing wants to come apart. I tried to grate a softer cheese, and all it did was get clogged up. The ""freshness"" seal does NOT seal well enough to keep anything fresh for more than a couple hours.So, unless you enjoy being laughed at by your cheese or vegetables, or whatever food you are foolish enough to believe this thing will grate, save your money and your time. ZERO STARS!!!!"
5,Wonderful gadget for grating parmesan cheese,"This is the third one I have bought. I love mine so much, and the design where you can put the cap on the end, and store your cheese in it, in the fridge. It has worked fine and is holding up great. The other two I have purchased have been for gifts. I use it all the time."
3,Know what to expect,"I read all of the reviews before purchasing this brand but even then I was surprised, being a newbie to cooking I assumed that it would grate in a course texture (as that was what I was looking for) so when it didn't mention that it only grate a fine texture I didn't think to ask. My husband tried it first and wasn't impressed, the handle worked fine except the texture of the chedder was so fine it clogged the output. I've tried it on other occasions and even when taking the cheese straight from the fridge (on pepperjack especially) it would spin the cheese into a loose rope rather than spread evenly on the food. I looked for a course drum to use instead but apparently Oxo doesn't make one for this model. I think I'll have to break down and buy a different brand with a course drum option."
1,Not Durable,"I used this grater twice before the little black knob broke off when I was grating some pecorino romano cheese. It works well, but it is not of durable construction. It would probably work better with softer cheeses, but it certainly wasn't worth the money I paid for it!"
2,Nice design...but it's broken too,"I've purchased several different rotary graters and this one had the same result as many of it's other plastic siblings. It too broke within 2 days of use. These plastic graters just aren't built with much strength and should not be used with harder cheeses, or by someone who has a strong grip. The common defect I'm finding in plastic graters is how the rotating arm is attached to the drum. The tiny amount of plastic there isn't desined to withstand shearing forces which is what rotates the drum.When I find a good rotary cheese grater, I'll write a review on it."
1,Broke after 2 month,"This one was not worth the money. It did only last for 2 month. The black piece on the handle is just slipped on and after it came off, there was no way of getting it on again. Without the black part it's impossible to grind the cheese without hurting your hand. Bummer!"
1,Worthless,"Please don't buy this. OXO makes some fantastic products. This is not one of them. It's fine for super-hard cheese, but anything softer than Parmesan-Reggiano gloms it up pitilessly until it becomes useless."
4,Great... But watch out for that handle,"We just picked up a new one of these after the old one's handle broke at the base.I was really irritated at first, but then it occurred to me how long it has been in use and how much we've asked of it over the years. Hard cheese is a snap, but one of my wife's signature dishes calls for roasted, grated walnuts. A lot of them. She used to make it often.The star taken off of this view is specifically because the handle broke on my old one. Yes, it was getting old, but that's an obvious weak point of the design and it should be reinforced.The star I didn't take off - but considered it strongly - was for the price here on Amazon. The new one I just picked up in a brick-and-mortar store was $7.99 - nearly half what Amazon is currently listing this for."
1,worthless,This is the worse cheese grater. It falls apart in your hands when you are using it. This is due to the design of the product. Don't buy this unless you want to spend the rest of your time frustrated & paying twice as much when you realize this item is worthless & you now have to buy another grater by a different brand.
4,really does grate cheese!,"its a little bulky , but very efficient . would recommend as it does what is expected of itLike the way you can grate lots of cheese with the little door closed- less mess for sure"
3,Not for mindless users,"Like one reviewer said - don't invite King Kong to use this and it may last.But neither Godzilla, - the plastic is pretty crappy and mine warped in the dry cycle of the dishwasher. Sure, I should have put it on the top rack instead off the bottom.... but like I said - a PhD in thermonuclear and tactile force sciences helps.And like that user said, most complaints about gumming and cheese getting stuck is solved to some degree y running it backwards.The blades aren't as sharp as Zyliss or Microplane,Its OK, but there is better at the same price."
1,"If you like a lot of work for a little reward, buy this","I have been fortunate with a really great cheese grater. I had it for many years until it finally broke. I bought this product as a replacement. It makes grating cheese and exausting and frustrating chore. It is awkward to hold and grate with. It is dishwasher safe, but doesn't lay flat for the dishwasher to clean. I am sorely disapointed in this product."
1,"Not good for anything but hard, dry items",This might be good for hard cheeses (parmesan) but with regular cheeses (cheddar etc.) it grates EXTREMELY fine and just gets completely clumped up inside the barrel. I want to return it but it seems like too much work for what I paid for it.Easy to put together and take apart though.
2,Doesn't work well for most cheeses & hard to clean,"I generally like Oxo brand products but this grater doesn't work well with most cheeses. It is only good on a hard cheese. For example, a sharp cheddar clumps together and needs to be scooped out with a knife. Afterwards, it is very difficult to clean as well."
2,good for two things...,"The only 2 foods it grates well are parmesan and chocolate, as long as the chocolate is cold, not worth the money, I think I'd rather use my small hand held gater. It was a good try, but I won't buy another one."
2,Just OK,"I got a traditional grater very soon after buying this one. For the money, it's a pretty good value, but it grates messily, is hard to clean, and is very uncomfortable to use. Also comes apart if you're not careful while grating. My cheese always came out lumpy, and forget about grating veggies. Blades are very dull. Nice if you feel like you have to have a rotary grater and don't want to pay too much. But only use for very soft foods."
1,Terrible,I bought this for hard cheese grating and it is horrible. I would not recommend this grater for hard cheeses.
4,Great Feeder Timer,I have been using these feeder timers for years. I now own 6 of them. I like how they automatically adjust when they throw as the season goes on. They are tough and dependable. The all metal construction holds up well to the racoons and squirrels. I do not like the funnel that comes with this timer. I always buy a different funnel that I can attach to the barrel so the animals will not lift the funnel up to make the corn pour out.
2,Cheap,"I owned many smart timers in the fast that were the greatest timer ever. These ones are poor quality compared to the old ones. The New housing and bottom door are cheap plastic. There are no hinges to open, just a crease in the plastic. The timer is not attached very well and feels like it will break every time you open the box."
1,For BALLET dancers,"I found the advice given in this book to be simple common sense, In other words, I have that so I should have used it to flip through the pages and see I did not need this book! Also, it is directed only at ballet dancers- I am a jazz dancer(though I study ballet as well). Still, I felt discounted. Dance describes so many diferrent genres. The title should have specified it's focus."
3,Look Closer... at what you're actually buying,I was expecting the large format teacher's version of the book but I got a tiny student book instead. The book I received is in decent condition and arrived quickly.
4,Very Good,"The book covers a great deal of information, and the author is thorough in her knowledge. Unfortunately, as is true in most conservation books, authors will not give away all their information. Also, new products are not covered. It needs an addendum, an update, already. Still it is an excellent book for conservation."
1,Disappointing,"$4 product, $7 shipping, took over two weeks to arrive. The turner was far larger than expected, almost 10 cm in circumference, therefore difficult to hold. The 36 cm length is not a bad thing, mainly the bulkiness of the handle is unweildy. It was also rough, not sanded properly. After a single use and two washings, the edge developed six cracks, one is a cm long. Unable to locate a phone number for the seller, I emailed to request return instructions. The response was over two days' coming."
2,Quickly cracked,"I really like that the turner is the shape and size I wanted. It does its job well.That being said, however much I want to like it, the quality I expect just isn't there. After a short amount of time, the wood cracked in several places along the edge. The turner can't have suffered too much neglect; I hand wash it because I have no dishwasher, and I don't let it soak in the sink, or sit in food. The wood finish was also a bit rougher than I would have liked, but it has softened with use. Finally, I found the handle slightly uncomfortable to grip (especially when the wood was rough) and a little unbalanced (it felt strangely heavy). I am still using the turner, but I must make sure there is no food stuck in the cracks when I clean it. Once it really bits the dust, I hope to have better luck with a different brand."
5,"Just Great, Won't Break","I have lost count of the time I have broken most expensive but yet lesser wooded turners. Not so good with eggs, but great with meats, potato and macaroni salad mixing and all things pasta and spaghetti related. Has not stained or delivered a splinter so far!"
4,"My turn, your turn..","nice quality, but this thing is big. too big if you ask me. i'm no chef, but it's very large."
5,Well made and works great.,"The product was larger than expected (no worries there, it was actually a good thing). It seems quite sturdy and will work well for my needs."
1,"heavy, and it cracked in the first month - do not be fooled by attractive low price","I trusted OXO as a brand, but found this turner to be extremely heavy and non-ergonomic. Plus it cracked in less than one month and it's not like I cook that often. I think OXO should stick to extrusion plastic goods and stay away from wood products. Do not be attracted to this cheap price. Better to buy a bamboo turner for $1 at a Chinese supermarket - that lasts, is lightweight, and easy to wash."
1,Split after a couple of washes,"As the previous reviewer described, this turner starts to split after only a few washes. I would avoid this product, unless you want a disposable turner."
3,Not exactly a turner,"Unless we're talking about a bowl of peas, the wood on this item is entirely too thick and not wide enough to actually ""turn"" a pancake or fish fillet without completely destroying it."
2,Two cracks!,I use mine daily for stir frying. Got two giant cracks after about a month of use. Still usable though.
5,Jewels are a girl's best friend,I really enjoy this ring. The coloring of the stone is absolutely gorgeous.Lots and lots of compliments for this ring everytime I wear it.
5,Country Legend,"This has got to be the best of Charley's albums and has songs not found in many of his ""Greatest"" CDs that certainly belong there.Without this album you're not hearing all of Charley's best."
2,Blowing bubbles,"Bubble gum new age music at its best. Totally the opposite of what I like in new age, ambient music. It sounds very 1980's. It's mildly entertaining only because of its dated sound and pop-happy rhythms."
5,Relaxing and unforgettable!,"On vacation with my wife, we heard this beautiful recording and enjoyed it immensely! Now when we want to ""relive"" our trip, we put this on and enjoy the beautiful sounds of his music! A must for the very romantic!"
5,Ray Lynch: the Dean of New-Age music.,"Deep Breakfast is a tour de force for Ray Lynch, the Dean of New-Age music. Lynch has a way with music that puts you in a whole new world. Among the many great pieces on this album is the not to be missed The Oh of Pleasure. Don't miss your chance to experience something really special!"
1,Watch out. This not a digital version of the book.,"Read closely before buying. This is not an e-published version of the book by Fiona Durrant. It is only a three paragraph review of the book. Another expensive, misleading product from Elsevier."
5,Lose your Anger. I did.,"Although this book can get a little ponderous, it flipped a switch in me. I was one of those guys who got pissed at everything. By page 60 I was able to recognize the things that were making me angry, and not let them set me off. If you find that you are frequently irrationally angry, get this book. I can't begin to tell you the difference it made for me."
3,"The technique works, but the book is boring !","The book says that you try to fight with your anger rationally. When you are angry, try to convince yourself that it's not ""logical"" to be angry over this issue. When something goes wrong, you should feel disappointment, not anger. The technique worked for me. But the book is written in a very boring manner. The same ideas are repeated 3-4 times throughout the book. So if you've read 2 chapters, there is no need to read more."
1,GARBAGE!!!!!,"This was the first DVD of this series I ever acquired. I would NEVER get another and will throw this out. I did not realize that you could not watch these films without the commentary. While I have no problem with the films having the commentary, what possible good are they if that's the only way you can watch them."
2,James Bond goes bowling?,"This movie is fairly mediocre despite a great female cast, a capable lead, and a goofy but ok sidekick. Decent villain. The plot is kind of ridiculous though, chewing gum that makes the kids go crazy? It's sort of like a spy version of Reefer Madness.Still not sure what the New York in ""New York Chiama Superdragon"" has anything to do with, either - the only real named location is Amsterdam.I give it two stars for not being a waste of time, but it's not on the level of Master Stroke, nor does it contain as memorable a character as Lady Chaplin.Print is mostly acceptable, not fantastic. There is a scene with a text reveal that is impossible to read due to contrast and color fading issues. Other than that and a few scratches it's OK.Thanks to Sinister as always for putting this one out."
5,A true find for MST3K lovers,"As a true lover of MST3K this was a find for me. I love the B movies with the commentary by Crow,Mike or Joel and the gang. There are references to events and people of that time period (90's and 2000's). I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for commedy with a silly,quirky edge."
1,Secret Agent Super Bore,"""Secret Agent, Super Dragon"" saw itself as competition forBond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection [Blu-ray].... a handsome, hairy-chested, frequently shirtless Super Dragon (Ray Danton) woos the ladies... but action hero? Not really. He's out to save the world from hallucinogenic-laced chewing gum that has led to chaos among teenagers in... Fremont, Michigan(!!!) There are secret agent mystery devices, like a bulletproof vest and a tape recorder.. but the movie doesn't have the thrills of James Bond. Surprisingly, there's A LOT of dialogue. Super Dragon spends more time talking up the ladies than having action with the ladies. To quote Elvis,""A little less talk and a little more action.""TheMystery Science Theater 3000: Secret Agent Super Dragonversion is MUCH superior, simply because it's MST3K. Joel and the 'bots save this boring movie from itself."
2,disappointed,I've got a few of the earlier offerings of MST3K and enjoyed them.I understand these choices were not new episodes but the weren't the cream of the crop either- I guess it stands to reason that you package the better episodes first and the poorer ones later-Very Disappointed-Rich C
5,A MUST,"I HAVE ALL CDS BY 2002, KEEP THEM COMING. HAVEN'T BEEN DISAPPOINTED ONCE. THEY ARE USED FOR HEALING SESSIONS AND MASSAGE THERAPY. VERY BEAUTIFUL, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
4,Relaxing,"This is my first CD of 2002. The music is relaxing, easy listen and specially after a hard day work. I recommend ""Chrysalis"" and ""Healing Rain"" Beautiful 2002."
3,"Relaxing, but a bit repetitive.","I was a bit disappointed by this album. I read the reviews of it and had high expectations. True, that it is relaxing music, but nothing more than that. Some of the songs are truly repetitive and they aren't many noticeable melodies. It's a pretty good CD, but it's not the best I have listened to. I would recommend Tranquility over this one any day."
2,Disappointing,I found this book to be incredibly boring and of little to no use. Plenty of better resources out there.
4,"Concise, Excellent Bang for Buck","A solid, common-sense guide to technical writing that is applicable to writing in general. The tips and pointers presented in this manual will improve all your writing, not just technical. This book makes the excellent point that good technical writing is ultimately just good writing...applied to technical subjects. Excellent buy."
1,piece of junk,first time it was washed it filled up with water... never worked right again!!! stay away
1,Very very innacurate,"I bought this the other day, and was puzzled at how it seemed to be reading unrealistically low temperature. I tested it by putting the tip in boiling water - 180 degrees. The boiling temperature of water is 212. There is no way to calibrate it. Oxo is usually a good brand, but this thing is not a good product. I am taking it back."
1,Poor product,"It's junk for all the other reasons stated. Plus if you follow the temperature guidelines for the different kinds of foods, you may not get food poisoning, but you may as well just throw your food into a fire pit and char it. It would be about as edible. 180 for poultry? Only if you don't care how your food tastes (none) or feels (like leather)."
1,Lousy product design,"I haven't even used the thermometer yet, but I'm going to be returning it. The thermometer doesn't fit into the plastic sleeve it came with. Of course, then I also read all the reviews here, which make me less inclined to keep it. I've had a good opinion of the Good Grips line before now, but this certainly leads me to revisit that."
2,Not backlit as advertised,"VERY disappointed. Purchased prior to a trip overseas, and backlight never worked. I could use it in bright sunlight, but never at night or in airplane. Numbers were very difficult to see without backlight. It only cost me $8.00 so it wasn't worth sending back."
3,Broken flag pole,"The honest truth about this product is that it is beautiful! The flag is well made and a proud addition to our family. The pole however is not. After only one week displaying the flag, the wood around the pole connecter split/broke away from the connecter. The wood is not hard-wood therefore cannot take the weight of the flag.I will purchase another pole but it will be metal.The box indicated that the mounting bracket was adjustible however it is not. It's a fixed bracket with only one position and exactly like the one pictured here.We purchased this product because it's made in America hopefully by Americans who by the way have no control over the integrity of the woods strenth."
1,Not what I expected.,"I needed to replace my flags so I bought a heritage flag from Valley Forge thinking it would look like an antique flag. Well mine must have been left in the dye barrel too long. It doesn't look old. It just looks nasty, so I'm sending it back."
5,Very useful,"This book has lots of quaint b&w pictures of different kinds of transportation, also on a CD-ROM, ready to use on any computer."
3,"Light,sweet,balmy,and powdery",It's a step down from Canoe. I'd say Canoe is way better. Very cosmetic... What do you expect from Avon?
5,"Walley Comes Closest to ""Solving"" Speer Murder","As a student at Northfield Mount Hermon in the early 1970s, little was said about the unsolved murder of former Headmaster Elliott Speer. I recall a rumor that the gun used in the killing was somewhere on the bottom of the school's Shadow Lake. Craig Walley's well-researched and -written book examines that rumor and many more in an absorbing murder mystery. Murder at Mount Hermon captures the school's history and religious roots, and how the forward-thinking Speer's efforts to break from the past and move the school and its students into a new era sealed his fate. While the murder remains unsolved, Walley's book comes closer than ever before to finding the ""smoking gun."""
1,Poorly constructed - air valve will not remain closed,"Let me start out by saying that I did not buy this product for its intended purpose, so I can't speak to its effectiveness as a scarecrow. But even as a decoration, this was ineffective. Aside from looking more like a brown beach ball than an owl, the main problem was that the valve stem would not stay closed. At first, I thought I had overinflated it, but even with minimal inflation, the valve stem would pop open. I ended up using a binder clip to pinch the top closed. I would not buy this product again."
2,All Good But The Valve,"This inflatable decoy impressed me with it's design, low cost, and ease of use. The issue I had was the valve wouldn't stay plugged, so it was essentially unusable. Luckily I was able to return it for a full refund. It's a vinyl owl, not a life and death deal, so I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm feeling generous. No harm, no fowl. (You see what I did there?)"
2,CHEAP blow-up Owl which i bought to keep my chickens away from my solar panels,"Well 1st of all, this blow-up Owl dose not keep the chickens away from walking on my solar panels!2nd I was kind of disappointed in it's construction..The air hole kept giving me problems with the plug not staying in/sealingthe blow-up hole.. It kept popping out & not because of to much pressure either : (Anyway it's holding air now, due to a little super glue applied to the plug to secure it."
3,its an inflatable owl!,well it inflated... and the pigeon's didn't seem to care. I guess i have some hardened pigeons.
2,will never buy anymore,bad quality. the connection with arm and chair is weak and easy to be broken off. I meet the same problem twice so I dont think its just an accident.
3,Good but not great!,"The best thing about this booster seat/high chair is the portability of it. It will be great to take with us to travel. The padding on the seat and back are pretty thin and the pad is not attached at the back. Therefore, when you put the baby in the seat the pad tries to slide down. Very annoying. It does attach very securely to the chair so that is good. Overall, I would say it is a good product."
3,Not for everyday use.,"I have twin grandsons and wanted something to use when they were at my house. I didn't want to spend very much, since they would see limited use. These are okay, but not great. It is hard to get the tray on and off. They do fold up and will probably go with us to family for Christmas. They do not recline, so would not work well until a baby can sit. If you want a chair to keep in your trunk for when you go somewhere, this would probably work well. If you are wanting something to use on a daily basis, spend a little more and get something that is easier to use and will hold up well."
3,Great Alternative to full size high chair,"This is a great alternative to a full size high chair, however, I had concerns with the safety straps. While they seemed to be secure, the one that goes under the seat and clips together under the chair seat came apart - not from the buckle, but from the strap coming out of the slots. The tray is not simple to remove and the 'height adjustment' feature is hardly worth mentioning. I honestly cannot see a child over 25 pounds using this seat comfortably. It rates great on the 'cuteness' side."
4,Nice for the price,I needed a couple of these for my boys and these were the perfect price. The tray is nice for the little one to use and it is also very easy to clean. I also like that it's not too high so we can push up against our dining table.
2,"There are better ones, let me tell you","I bought this one for my 10 month old. I was sold on some of the reviews, and thought I would try a different one. I have the Fischer price healthy deluxe for my other baby( now 25 mo.). I thought I might like the high are rest and tray, but the don't make up dFor the poorer quality plastic, all the crevasses and places for food to get into ( which people talk about this booster not having). I have decided to keep this be in the car for travel and purchase what I should have in the first place. Fischer price healthy care ( deluxe)."
3,Its good for the price.,Its easy to secure it onto the chair and my 7 month old daughter loves to sit and play on it.I wish sliding in and out the tray was easier and the cut marks under the tray was smoother. The plastic scratched my daughter a bit when I pulled her out with tray extended out. I would need to cover it up with paper tape...Also on a regular height table and chair the booster seat won't slide under the table like it shows on the box. Unless you get a shorter chair. If the arm rest was detachable or bendable outdated seat would slide under the tableOverall it does it's job.
2,You get what you pay for,"Don't like at all!! Very hard and uncomfortable and my baby hates it!! Its only good for quick snacks, it's not a product made with baby in mind it's more for a dog... I know crazy right but out tea cup pup loves it, it's hers now! Spend a bit more and get something useful."
2,not well made,"I just received my daughter infant sit today. I am very disappointed. The way you put in the cushion is by three little thin string straps at the top, which isn't even secure, and it dosnt really have any cushion in it. The middle straps where you attach the other two straps in to hold the child in place is unsecured as well. You cannot unjust that strap so it is just loose, so there's really no support in the straps at all. Over all the folding in well done and it cute, but to me not safe at all."
2,Nice to have if it didn't break,"This product was nice to use, until it broke. The little plastic pieces that fold up and lock in place, that the tray slides onto.. They broke off. Without any mistreatment.. Seems like it was weak due to poor manufacturing. Had it for a little over 2 weeks and it broke."
3,"Irish Twins, Boston, Ma",not the best but it did the job. I wish the back and the straps was better madethanks SB
4,"Perfect ""pinch hit"" high chair","I bought this seat for my 10 month old, 24 pound nephew to use when he visited my vacation home. For the price, it is impressively well made and easy to use. He fit well in it, and seemed comfortable. The pieces are easily cleaned or washed. When my vacation was over, I mailed it home. It folded easily and fit back into the original box for shipping. I would highly recommend this seat to people who have occasional baby visitors at meal time."
2,Get a sewing machine,"We decided to get this booster for our little one because she hates sitting in cheap restaurant high chairs. The straps broke the first time we tried to mount it on a chair. We thought about returning it but then figured hey, it's only [...], maybe we can just fix it. So, I took out my sewing machine and sewed the straps back on so now its functional. I noticed the threads they used were very cheap and fine, not for heavy duty materials, and the seams were loose on all the straps. So, make sure you have a sewing machine handy to reinforce the seams. I give it 2 starts for poor quality. It goes without saying, you get what you pay for...."
1,hated this,hated this productthe seat is too hard for the girls it is hard to move from one position to another nothing is good about this do not buy I bought this and never used it did not return since I'm not a strng believer of returning thins
4,Age/Size Not Mentioned,"We just ordered this and received it and it will be going back. Amazon doens't say the recommended age/size for this seat. We opened the box and it says this is recommended for 6 months to 33 pounds. My daughter is 34 pounds so we can't use this.The pad included in only attached to the seat at the top, not in the seam by the childs butt or at the bottom of the seat. There are holes in the padding for the straps to hold the kid in, but no other way of keeping the padding on the bottom of the seat."
3,Okay,This is an okay seat. The cushion is cute but not cushy and not really hooked well. It slides all over the place. The cushion does wash well though. But honestly we have taken it out and just wash the plastic. The waist straps are too loose and don't tighten. Luckily our son is big enough so the tray helps hold him in. It does the job if you don't have enough room for a highchair but you may want to keep looking.
5,LOve love it,I have been using now fro almost 2 years. We mostly use a high chair but this works great when we want to put our daughter up to the table..only thing once they get a certian size the tray is useless
3,Could be better.....,"You have to assemble this seat, which my husband did. That was easy enough for him. It was easy enough to attach to the dining room chair. It is easy to clean. My only complaint is that the tray is kind of a pain to get on correctly. I wanted a girlie chair for my daughter, but now I wish I would've gone with the Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe like I had for my son."
4,good inexpensive seat!,"i bought this as an inexpensive seat to have while traveling. i like how it folds very flat so it doesnt take up too much space when packing it. i wish it had a little padding on the seat, since the full sized one we have at home is very comfortable and this isnt so comfortable, but it does the job."
4,Good booster,"It does the job and is easily transportable. I wish the tray were a little easier to get on and off, but overall - it's a great purchase."
4,All you need in a feeding chair.,"I love this chair, and so does my daughter. She has plenty of room for her legs (we had trouble with another comming right down on her legs), and the table adjust to 3 diffrent lenght's so there is rooom for her to grow. the only complaint I have is that the back cushion comes off every time she eats in it, but that is an easy fix. I would definitely recommend getting this chair it is well worth the $20 a much better option than buying a large high chair that you have to make room for in you dinning room that is well over $100, in my opinion :)."
2,Not very good.,"This would be fine for traveling but not for everyday use. As others have mentioned, the seat ""pad"" (I use the term loosely - it's not very padded at all) only attaches at the top and slides all over the place. The straps are hard to tighten and the tray is hard to get on/off. The only good things about this are that it folds up flat and is portable. That's it."
2,It worked but not well,"I own a regular high chair and a space-saver, but I was traveling and so I had this delivered to where I was staying. It did the job, but there were two problems. The decorative cover only comes down half-way (as can be seen in the picture but I did not really think about the implications) so my son kept sliding. And the act of putting the tray on was very difficult and required a second set of hands every time it was attempted."
5,I bought two!,"Simple, easy, great price. It does it's job. I bought one for home and one for Grandma's house. My kids love to play in it too. Compact and easy to use, colors will match any decor. Easy to clean."
5,Booster seat,My grandson was too big for the highchair that I had that hooked to the table. This works great and he is just the right height to the table.
4,Perfect for our needs,"My mother go this for my at the time 4 month old daughter. We were nearing the solids phase and needed a chair but we have a bar hight table and wanted the chair to be level with the table so she would feel like she is part of the meal instead of just watching it. We also didn't want a huge chair that tool up a bunch of space.The chair is perfect for us, it fits snugly in out chair and she fits in it very well. I do not like the cushion however because it is very flat and hard to clean, so we just don't use it. My favorite part about it chair is that the whole thing fits in my kitchen sink which makes cleaning it so easy. Also the fact that the whole thing can be folded up and carried along is nice since we regularly eat at a family's homes who are past the high char phase. The tray however is a little smaller than you would get on a full sized chair witch means more food ends up on the floor, but that is what you get with a ""space saving"" high chair."
4,Booster,"Perfect choice for a traveling highchair. My granddaughter recently visited and she loved her chair! Easy to set up, store or travel with, a breeze to clean up after each meal."
5,Great product!,"These are attractive, versatile and functional. You just push or pull the ring at the end to open and close them. I have the 9"" and the 12"" and love them both."
2,Not heatproof!,"With everything else made of silicone these days, I was quite surprised to have these melt the first time we used them in a hot pan."
2,Not good,These tongs would be great but they are useless because the nylon heads keep falling off. Not very useful without the nylon head.
5,love this,"Theres a lock feature at the end where you pull or push depending on whether you want them open or closed. They are non-stick tips for your non-stick pans. Cleans well, I have in two sizes and fine them very well purpoused. Oxo knows their stuff"
4,Nice lock,"I believe the tongs to be very good, The locking mechanism work so nice, easy and secure, I don't know if it is the best, but these are pretty close."
4,Oxo Good Grips- 12 inch,I have the smaller good grips (I think it was 9 inches) and just purchased the 12 inch. I think the 12 inch is too big for a womens hand is more suited to a mans.
2,melt in anything other than a non-stick pan,"after reading many reviews, we thought these tongs will be useful for many different recipes with all our pans - iron, stainless, non-stick.big mistake !!! maybe in 2004 oxo was using better plastic, but in 2009 the plastic they use is simply awful: the tips melted the moment they touched an iron pan on low-to-medium heat.we have old plastic utensils from a dollar store and they perform much better; at the very least they do not melt as quickly as this brand new oxo product.we bought these in a set with two turners and those were not great either. back to the store the set goes. wish someone warned us about melting plastic - having bits and pieces of black plastic in your dish is not a good thing.will try tongs with silicone tips next."
5,They work great and save my pots and pans!,"I have the same tongs with metal heads and always gingerly pick up whatever I'm cooking for fear of scratching my pots and pans. I usually end up getting stung by popping oil more often than not because of this. But with these bad boys, there's no fear of scratching so it sames me and my cookware![...]"
5,Perfect tongs!,"Perfect length, doesn't scratch my pans - does exactly what it claims it will do. The lock is useful as well. A keeper!"
3,Great Tongs Except,The tips melted and Im not quite sure how as I didnt put on anything that hot. I got these because they were recommended by Test Kitchen. Maybe it was my fault but I am dissapointed.
5,Kitchen essential,"I would have five of these in my kitchen if I could, I'm always finding a use for them. I also love to give them as wedding gifts because they are so useful and not many people have them. Recently the husband of a couple I gave them to thanked and told me he uses them all the time!I'm pretty sure that Cook's Illustrated highly recommended Oxo Good Grips tongs - I certainly love them."
5,Great kitchen tool,"I use this quite often with my cooking. Great for many uses; turning meat, veggies as they brown, lifting out of pan to serve, barbecuing, etc.It protects my nonstick pans from being scratched. Quite simply, I love these tongs! The 12-inch length is better than the 8-inch too."
1,Question advertising,"Despite the hype and advertising about this tool and similar items from this and other manufacturers, it is not ergonomic or even mechanically well-designed, and in fact can cause injury. The hand actually does all the work of squeezing and holding--and in my case, my fingers curl under the narrow back section--which has led to serious pinches when a heavy or slippery item unexpectedly slides from the tongs--a nice leveraged pinch which might be better described as getting a finger crushed in a door."
3,Oxo Good Grips,We used to buy this product at the church.I bought these for our church.But old one had a problem about black rubber.ond side of black rubber took out from stainless body.But still it works.
5,A MUST HAVE FOR ANY COOK,I love my Oxo Good Grip 12 inch locking tongs as much as I do my Oxo Good Grip 16 inch locking tongs. They work great on turns any type of food. Please check out my review on the Oxo Good Grip 16 inch locking tongs and all that I said about those are true for the 12 inch tongs also.
2,No traction in hot water or stock,"I thought I was upgrading from my old metal tongs to something of real quality in getting these nifty-looking tongs. Now I wish I had my old plain tongs back. In trying to retrieve something from hot water or stock, the nylon-coated ends have no traction. As a result, I have some burns to show for using the wrong tool for the job. The ends just get slippery when trying to turn pieces of cooking chicken in liquid, for instance, and random splashing of hot stock as the chicken falls back into the pot. Were these tested before marketing? A big disappointment. Beware!"
3,Fine for General Grabbing,"I was looking for a good set of tongs that had some weight to them where the spring wouldn't rust out after a few washings and the ends were protected. I read earlier reviews about this tong having heat issues and I don't plan on testing that. They work as expected. They open strong, have a hefty feel to them and you don't think they'll bend if you really grab something. The only drawback that I can see (and it's probably a really silly one), on more than one occasion, I've had a pot in one had, grab the tongs in another and then have to bite the unlocking mechanism to release the tongs. If I'm smarter than I've been in the past, I would *actually* pick the tongs up first. heh...I'm not that smart sometimes, tho! Overall, a decent product but now I have to find tongs with silicon tips."
4,perfect tongs,These tongs are great the perfect lenght & weight. The grips are nice & the ends of the tongs do not scratch my non-stick pans. Shipping was VERY slow took forever to get them. Would rate higher if not for slow shipping.
3,Disappointed given it's Oxo,"The nylon heads have melted slightly, even though I never leave them in a pan (and my pans don't even get that hot, because I have an electric stove). They get the job done, but I've come to expect more from Oxo products."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is not a good tape. The instructor fails even a basic stepper. The ""advanced"" instuctor works on a low step using hand weights incorrectly. Use Kathy Smiths tape to get a better, more informative work out. Smiths tape is good for all levels."
1,No guys in this one.,"The description says Steve Bacic, Dale Wilson, and Sam Malkin are in this video. The only place I know these guys are together, is in 21 Jump Street, episode #100, Wasted.I bought a used copy just to verify it."
5,Completely satisfactory bookends.,"These bookends are completely utilitarian, simple, and effective. The design is not unattractive, but it does not intrude upon the style of the room where the bookshelves are."
2,They look nice but...,"I bought these to use in a bookshelf, but they are rather cheaply made. There is nothing on the bottom of the bookends to keep them from scratching whatever surface they are placed on. I had to adhere small strips of leather to keep these bookends from destroying my bookshelf. other that that, they look fine and work fine, just be aware that you might want to put something on the bottom of them to keep them from destroying your furniture."
3,"Good, but not great","These bookends are a little bit flimsy and it was difficult to get all of my books situated with them because they were so easy to tip. Once I got the books in place, the bookends seem to hold them up alright. I like that they are discreet and aren't the focal point. I bought them to display all of my colorful cook books in my kitchen and I do like the look once it is all in place. I'd give them a 3.5 if I could do half stars. I did have to bend one of them back in to shape while I was initially arranging the books and the books fell sideways and crashed to the floor. I didn't think arranging a few books would require three hands."
5,bookends,This is just what I have been looking for and I will buy more.I needed bookends in my overheads at work. I use them to keep books andnotebooks from falling over. They are just as The photo demonstrates with longforks to hold all the material upright.
1,Who says pictures don't lie?,"The 1-Star rating is for the innacurate listing rather than for the item itself. If you do a search for ""chrome bookends,"" this is the first item that shows up in the results.The picture for this listing depicts chrome bookends. What you receive however are black bookends, otherwise known as the ""Bookends - Elements LG Black."" Disappointed!"
5,Utilitarian perfection,"I got the chrome large size. I cannot attest to rows of text books or binders, but these things will hold anything I've put them under so far. I'm holding up rows and rows of toddler board books from super tiny to super big. Simple nonobtrusive design is great. The chrome is modern, yet blends in with the edge of the books, so virtually invisible. Just what I wanted. There is no padding on the bottom, but I have not had a problem with scratching. However, my shelves are painted wood, not a fine-grain high polished wood surface. They might not work as well with that type of surface."
4,Cool Bookends,Great book ends. They look nice and function fine. I have both the small and large styles and both are holding up their end! ;)
2,Inadequate,"The bookends looked to be of substantial weight to hold a row of ~ 10 books, but weren't strong enough."
5,Tactical Fly Swatter,This is the terminator; the dealer of doom; the final word in destruction. It's not for little girly-boys. I have never missed with this bad boy. Deadly on even the biggest of the nasty little @#&%%#@.
1,"nice design, ineffective","This flyswatter, although a very nice design, was lacking in the quality of materials used to fulfill that design. It began to disintegrate upon the first hard swat to the kitchen counter, and little bits flew of the swatter part with each ""smack"" until now there is barely half of it left. I recommend you buy the old fashioned, cheap, wire mesh one."
3,Could be better,"We kill a lot of flies here being surrounded by cows. This is a good design made of cheap material. We have had three Oxo swatters. All three have failed starting at the edges of the fly outline molded in the impact area. The plastic hardens and fails, breaking into little pieces. Too bad. Well worth a third of the price."
5,very effective swatter,"I wanted an easy to use swatter which wouldn't miss too many flies. And I was not disappointed. I don't think I missed even a single fly so far. And at that price, its a steal."
5,gets 'em every time!,Every single fly my husband has swatted with this swatter now rests in peace. Enough said ;)
5,best ever,This is the best fly swatter I have ever encountered. It does not break like plastic ones and it has a great design for precision swatting.
5,Hook On Fly Tying w/ Mike Martinek jr. -video-Classic Smelt,This is one of the best produced videos of it's time. The smelt patterns on the New England states are one that is missleading in it's rich history and tying technics- Mike Martinek presentation takes care of both with cystal clear instructions! This is just one of 4 videos from series- ALL HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1,SHIPPING COST..Holy Poop....Wake up Amazon!,"Why would Amazon ever allow a seller with an 80% positive feedback even be on their website? $32.94 for shipping? Even if it holds 500 rolls of tape, it's still not worth it."
4,Watch out!,"This peeler is super sharp and really dangerous to use without chainmail gloves or maybe oyster shucking gloves. The quality and sharpness are fantastic, but I find it hard to use without injuring myself. The output (minus the blood) with both zucchini and yellow squash were great as replacements for pasta in my low carb diet. Use with care."
2,sensitive teeth,This peeler does a great job when new but the teeth are very prone to bending easily and then it becomes useless as a julienne peeler. you can use it as a regular veggie peeler but why bother buying this? very often the guard falls off too. i have gone through several of these and now have given up. i do not recommend this. am going to try the Kuhn Rikon.
3,"Worked, but tedious","It's easy enough to use and worked as advertised BUT it was a pain to do one small zucchini. It is very sharp, and the grip made it easy to hang onto. But it is awkward to hold the food item once it gets down to about halfway gone. I would not recommend this if you have any kind of muscle or joint issues. I have Fibromyalgia and it really was much more work than it was worth."
2,review,"I didnt think the product worked as well as expected. The blade also seemed to stick on many products causing difficulty in the slicing. Most important....there should be a better cover over the blades. When product is placed in the drawer., I have cut myself a few times when grabbing for something else."
2,Very hard to prep for papaya salad,"I bought the Kiwi pro slicer, was cheaper and worked 100 times better then the OXO brand. Would not buy this brand again. When slicing it leaves all the sliced on the papaya and you can't contentiously keep slicing because it will fill up with papaya and stop slicing."
4,Great trick in the kitchen!,"I saw this gadget in a cooking class. When I got home, I bought two of them.One for me, and the other for me. I put the other one in the drawer of my vacation house.Just remember to buy big carrots. And have fun."
3,Was a disappointment,"Very flimsy cutting edge--very thin metal. Plastic safety part doesn't want to stay on. For an OXO item, it was a disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this item to anyone. It's usable but that's about it."
1,I haven't managed to make it work.,I just seem to be scraping it. I'm not getting any strips at all.
3,Not very durable,"I had used two of this tool. I found out after about 20 carrots, the teeth on the tools starts to become ""soft"", it is still sharp, but they can't hold up the up-straight position any longer."
1,Broke the first time I used it!,"I bought the Good Grips julienne peeler because it was a few dollars cheaper than Kuhn Rikon's. I tried it on potatoes, cheese, and cucumbers. By the time I was done, it had twisted some of its teeth. Also, it's really easy to nick your skin with this. I'm wondering if the Kuhn Rikon julienne peeler would be better -- if there's some added quality that comes with the higher price."
3,Disappointed,"Was looking for a hand held julienne peeler and bought the Oxo Good Grips Julienne Peeler because of how much I like many of Oxo's other kitchen tools. I was very disappointed in the operation of this peeler and especially found the clear safety cover ackward. The julienne slices are more like matchsticks, good for stir frying, but not as fine as I wanted for salads and garnishing. I returned the Oxo peeler and purchased the one sold by Kuhn Rikon -- just what I was looking for. If you value reviews before you purchase, hope this helps."
1,Worthless!,Does not last as the blades bend and then just becomes a peeler. Sad that OXO made such a bad product.
3,Use with care,"Very handy for creating even strips, but have to press a little hard some times to cut into firmer vegetables, such as carrot. Always leaves behind a final strip or chunk that cannot cut through safely. Blades are sharp, so need to take care not to julienne your finger (like I did)."
5,Great Music!,"I wasn't familiar with these artists until I heard the demo CD at a bookstore. Since then, I have bought the CD for a couple different friends (each one having different music tastes) and they have all loved the music and referred it onto other friends. It's inspirational music!"
2,3 good tracks,"If you can find this cd on the cheap go ahead and scoop it up.Otherwise don't bother.""Tears of joy""by Govi is a heartfelt number and his ""Beach fire dancers"" features hypnotic flutes and a tropical rhythm that is irresistable.""Summer Rain"" from Shastro is very laid back with a hint of melancholy and longing.The other stuff on the collection is the usual assortment of bad synth and vapid new age drivel that isn't worth the listening."
1,JAZZY,VERY DISAPPOINTED! THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO DRAW DIFFERENT THINGS. TURNS OUT IT TEACHES YOU HOW TO MAKE PICTURES USING FINGER AND THUMB PRINTS. I MISSED THAT IN THE DESCRIPTION.
5,WOW! Extremely creative!,"This is an amazing book. My 4-year old daughter had so much fun with it. She's not a great artist, but she loves arts and craft. This book boosted her confidence in her ability to create all kind of pictures with just ovals and lines (or finger and paint if you have those handy)."
5,Fun and easy,Most Ed Emberley books are a treasure. They're simple enough for children but adaptable enough for adults. Funprint and Picture Pie are my absolute favorites. It incorporates all of the Funprint books into one so you can easily find inspiration. My son LOVES fingerprint art and we have a really good time using the book together- comparing to see who has done what with their respective prints.
5,Great classroom resource,This is my go-to rainy day activity book. Students look forward to using their fingerprints to create little critters. Their imaginations get going and they come up with some great ideas based on the images in this book. I love all the Ed Emberley books I have!
5,Two thumps way up!!!!!!!!,"I can write a 10 page review for this film, but I won't because I have a life. This is a dark psychological drama. If you enjoy dark psych dramas this one is a must. What a treat!!!! Eva Green and Maria Valverde give Oscar winning performances."
3,Nasty Habits in a Girls' Public School,"Public schools (aka private schools) have always been a subject of endless fascination in the movies, especially boarding schools, which are believed to be hotbeds of warped sexuality, repression and sado-masochism. Films like IF ... and ANOTHER COUNTRY are earlier examples; even DEAD POETS SOCIETY, while celebrating the efforts of an inspirational educator, contains slight echoes of such preoccupations. CRACKS is a film situated squarely within the same tradition, in which young women are shut up in an incarcerated world, and have to learn to live (or not live) with one another, and a young teacher (Eva Green) comes to grief, despite her best efforts. A low-budget effort with a certain grisly fascination."
5,For Crying Out Loud by C.P. Whitaker,"C.P. Whitaker's new novel, ""For Crying Out Loud"", leaves the reader begging for more. This new writer bursts onto the scene with a tale that weaves its way into the human heart. A tale of self discovery, diversity and love that the reader can't put down. Whitaker melds the heartache of social injustice with an intelligent story of romance and passion. I laughed, wept, and was captivated throughout this untraditional, traditional love story with its twists and turns that left me hoping and guessing until the very last page."
3,Disappointed,"I first became acquainted with Ally Kerr's music when I watched Mushishi, where his ""Sore Feet Song"" is used as the intro. His voice is great and his music is soothing; but the other songs on the album really didn't click with me the way that intro did."
2,Too Small,"Item was too small, not long enough to wrap ankle, no indication in on lime as to who small it was. did not wrap ankle well."
1,My Dead Heart,I couldn't believe my eyes when I heard this CD. The title track is the worst I ever heard. There's no single right key in this playing. I felt asleep after 2 minutes.Even in a late night bar people should kill her.I give 0 stars
4,Makes Great Popcorn,"Have had this product for awhile now, makes great popcorn. A bit of a pain to clean afterwards, but it does make great popcorn."
4,"West Bend stir crazy 8 quart corn popper, black",Great popcorn popper. Will save dollars on popcorn bill. buy it for your family today.
5,Hot Popper,"I got my corn popper and tried it out immediately. I have had several poppers, but this one seems to pop hotter and faster and more complete than any one I have ever had. So far so good and I know it will get a great work out from me."
2,"Great popper, but does not last long","I have used a Stir Crazy popcorn popper for many years. When our 6 quart popper motor wore out, we got the 8 quart. I would not recommend the 8 quart as it is only one year old and the motor broke. We wonder if there is too much popcorn in the popper. The taste of the popcorn is great but stay with the 6 quart popper so your motor won't wear out also."
