1,What is in stock ?,"I have been looking for a 9"" under the counter television. Every item I look at is not in stock. Are you in business or not ? The Philips PR0930X I'm looking for has been backordered for some time. As a matter of fact - I don't see anyhting on your site that is available. Heck of a way to run a business. If you don't have merchandise available you can't serve your customers - what customers you may have left. Provide a service or get out of business - the getting out of business part will take care of itself with this kind of product availability."
1,Design defect,"This is a nice TV overall but it has a ""design flaw"" that you should know about before purchasing it.I record both video and audio only (radio broadcasts) on my VCR. It works fine when there is video but when trying to play ""audio only"" video tapes or listen to audio only through my VCR the audio section of the TV shuts down completely (silence). This is not a problem with any other TV I own.In other words, for this TV to work properly it needs a video signal. If not it will not work, it will not play accept audio without video being present.Finally, when I called Philips Magnavox tech support it was like I was talking to a turnip. No matter how many times I tried to explain my problem to the tech he kept telling me that the problem was in my VCR, the connection, etc., even after telling him numerous times that it played video just fine. He just didn't get it. I asked for his supervisor and he wasn't much better."
5,Excellent lower body workout,"When you first start this workout it appears easy, but Ilaria ramps it up each notch that by the time you are done, you know you have worked. This exercise will change your lower body, guaranteed if you put it in rotation at least 3 times a week. Lastly, Ilaria is one of the best instructors out there, flawless ques. A must have."
2,I'd rather visit the dentist,"This book is about as much fun to read as a book about differential equations. Good concepts, but the context is very dry and puts me to sleep. I've been in the industry for several years, and I bought this book as a reference. But I find myself cringing every time I need to use it."
5,Ninja Scroll TV...Cool !,"If you thought the Movie was good then just wait till you've seen the TV series! Its not strayed far from the Movie at all to be honest, in terms of the Martial Arts scenes anyway. A new set of characters (And two old ones) Great Animation and a brilliant score. This is Ninja Anime at its best. Highly Recomended!!"
5,Coming of age...romance...danger and delight!,"Winston Graham is the consumate author, weaving his story with such insight, depth and charm. This, too, is an exciting and enticing read. You want to know more and more about this family and community which has now woven its way into your heart and mind."
4,You won't break a nail trying to open these lids!,"If you don't want to spend a small fortune on Tupperware, and you only want a small set of food storage containers, these will do. If you are looking for containers which will stack nicely, these are OK! Tupperware is better for kitchen cupboard storage. These are handy for keeping leftovers in the refrigerator.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Quick and simple recipes,"I am a novice cook and have recently started cooking from this book. I am Vietnamese and my husband is Korean. The recipes are super-fast and easy to prepare. All the dishes I've made have turned out delicious, with the exception of kim-chi. My husband told me that Kim-chi is very difficult to make. I can't vow to the authenticity of this book since I am not Korean; however, both my husband and I enjoy the food very much. Some of our favorite foods include spring chicken soup, chicken in soy sauce, cucumber with pork, and the homemade dumplings."
4,Good first book,"I used the original edition of this book and it was my introduction to dendrology. It shows the overall tree, leaf structure, and flowers, which are the main parts to use in identifying a plant. One thing it lacks is a close up illustration of the bark, useful in differentiating pines, firs, and so forth, and even hardwoods such as sycamore, which has peeling, deciduous bark, and the prunus genus, which contains cherry trees, which have horizontally striated, lenticele bark. This book covers North America so it can't be exhaustive in such a small book, but nevertheless, many important trees get covered, and it still makes a good choice for a young, budding naturalist. Also, trees are a good place to start with plant identification since they're so big and usually relatively easy to identify. Another great book on trees to start with trees Donald Culross Peattie's Natural History of North American Trees, which is now 65 years old and a classic, but still one of the best."
3,quick reference,This is a quick light reference for throwing in your bag and hitting the trails. Not indepth and uses the leaves for identification. Illustrations are good.
5,Ever Wondered About That Tree With The Fluffy Flowers?,"This book covers all the basic tree types you are likely to run across anyplace but a botanical garden. The illustrations make it easy to identify your mystery tree by leaf type or flower type, and sometimes even bark appearance. It doesn't have EVERY tree you are going to see as it doesn't deal with foreign imports but it should cover just about every tree you are going to see just driving down a road or in someone's yard."
1,Steal This Book.,"Bad pictures. Not enough about his death. Nat Hentoff continues to prove that he can't write. Boring. Greatly exaggerates Bix's influence on the world of jazz. Don't pay for this, pull an Abbie Hoffman."
2,Out to Lunch,"Eric Dolphy said it best. This book really misses the point. It exaggerates Bix's influence on modern jazz and doesn't provide enough dirty details to create an interesting human portrait. Comparing him to Van Gogh? Please! He couldn't read music. Bad pictures, too. Don't waste your time."
3,Pscyhoeducational Groups is a rare book...,"I was asked by my clinical director to assist the company with defining the State of Arizona's Psychoeducational component of treatment of the Severe Mentally Ill. After much review and discussion, we then needed appropriate books and literature to educate staff and to run groups with. After much review, this was one of the only books that addressesed specifically Pscychoeducation with group work.Overall the book was good and helped myself and the staff. I would rate this book an excellent guide for entry to mid level staff."
5,Rogue Nation - How a Conservative American Can See Ahead,"Clyde Prestowitz's credentials make him an unsuspected analyst of America's unilateralist policies. As a genuine fan of the USA, its core values and the determination of its people to create a real Nation, it is sad to observe the binary assumption of President Bush ""You're either with me or against me"".Mr. Prestowitz gets straight to the points that may have allowed America to become the world's superpower, but, to some extent, have created the roots of anti-Americanism and terrorism.As I went through this magnificent book, I though to myself: ""Maybe the American people will be the ones to use their ultimate weapon, and that's bound to happen in November '04, when Bush's term will be judged. With a slow economy, Iraq an unresolved nightmare, and the fear of terrorism, maybe voters will do the job, to the benefit of the world""."
1,"Interesting, but is it true?","Prestowitz presents and interesting argument about American policy and unilateralism. His book, however, is plagued by factual inaccuracies, partial quotations, and unattributed statements. Events and facts are misconstrued in order to fit into the picture he wants to create. These problems cast a shadow upon the whole work, making its arguments sound suspicious and its conclusions questionable at best."
1,Abysmal,"Clyde Prestowitz must be one of those Americans when he goes abroad he sits at his host's dinner table and nods approvingly when his fellow countrymen are described as backwards, provincial and not sophisticated enough to understand the world outside of the U.S. Why do I say this? Because Rogue Nation reads exactly like what you would expect from a sneering critic of the U.S., except this time the criticism comes from someone who could be considered part of the establishment.Rogue Nation has less to do with America's alleged policy blunders than it is a chance for Prestowitz to grind his axe and repeat line by line the same silliness the anti-war movement spewed for much of this year. Why is the world against the U.S.? Why because it failed to ratify the Kyoto Accord and Americans support Israel blindly, among other infractions. There are so many strawmen, dead-ends and pointless digressions in Rogue Nation that I'm appalled this book was actually published."
3,"Here, there are a curious experiment !!!","There are a curious and simpathy cover versions with a kind of a modern styles of over all songs of Mr.Joel. Don't disturb me anything. I think that is good for people didn't know him, like the new generations of kids doesn't heard this type of music. Movin' out (Anthony's Song) is very good and original cover version. Perfect for dancing in the discos, dance to the music! They did that with another themes song an other artist, why not the great Billy Joel??."
5,Vishal,Awesome book for people in the learning curve for lead guitaring. It teaches some really good melodious tunes and concepts. Worth it. I am a big time Satch Fan but this book has TAUGHT me some real good stuff.MUST BUY
5,A Must for aspiring guitarists and Dream Theater enthusiasts,"I think this is much more beneficial than the Rock Discipline video. John explains his exercises clearly and they are very constructive. I've been playing guitar for some 13 years before I picked this up, and even though I've only spent a couple weeks with this book (and a metronome I just as recently bought), I have noticed some improvement in my playing."
5,Excellent,A fresh attack on lead guitar. Great practice drills and exercises to get you out of a rut.
4,Not For the Novice,"If you're a novice and unfamiliar with scalar and modal guitar playing, get familiar with these before you try this. Good examples of tweaking scales and licks with non-diatonic and chromatic flavors. Tons of great exercises that really will improve your playing if you work at it. If you don't know a dominant seventh from a sus four, start with the basics."
5,This book's way cool!!!!,"Whoa dudes, this is the best guitar manual I ever read!! It contains anithing! From beginners' exercises to the solos of songs like ""Voices"" or ""Innocence Faded""! This rocks!!!"
3,anybody can play along to this,"i bought this book four years ago. it's meant to be kind of a quick fix if you feel you've hit a plateau in your playing. if you want to play insanely fast, and love dream theater, this is the book for you. if you really want material that will take your rhythm playing to the next level though, check out tomo fujita's dvds ""accelerate your guitar playing"" and ""more accelerate your guitar playing"". he shows you technicality AND soul, which i feel petrucci and these other players such as malmsteem are missing. great players, don't get me wrong, but they can't write a memorable song! you are probably the kind of guitar player who wants to play technical while being able to write memorable songs too, right? of course you do! check out the dvd's i recommend then. then look up tomo fujita's instructional vids on youtube. the next generation of musicians is depending on your talent, do not let them down."
5,Great Peter Sellers,"I have often felt that Peter Sellers is best seen when playing in the company of these supporting players. I think they inspire each other. Bernie Cribbins is hilarious. Sellers is great and unselfconscious. All of the members of the cast are great in this movie - even if they only have a line or two. It is a true ensemble effort and completely enjoyable from beginning to end. In my opinion, people have not seen Lionel Jeffreys unless they have seen him in this and ""Two Way Stretch."" (Another collaboration with Peter Sellers and members of this ensemble cast.) True comedy."
4,The Wrong Arm of the Law,This film really shows the versatility of Peter Sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting. This is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch. The quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source. Frankly you forget that it is in black and white format.
5,One of those things you don't think about...,"I have been cooking for more years than I care to think about. Up until a month or so ago, I didn't have an apple corer. It wasn't anything I ever thought of-not until I needed it, that is. Well, I finally have one! May I suggest this as as a small addition to a basket of utensils for newly weds or a housewarming gift?"
1,Foolproof,"FoolproofProduct was not shipped due to it not being available. The seller should not have offered an item that was in fact, not available."
4,Fun Movie,Good Movie. very much like Oceans * but in all made me smile. The ending was not expected at all. Want to see more like it.
2,Fine for free,"Meh. Nothing too different from most heist films, other than it's Canadian. My girlfriend thinks it was worse, but then again, she fell asleep (as she does to most films)."
3,"Entertaining, but fell short.","The plot of the movie is a fun idea. There were a few suspenseful moments, a couple of funny lines here and there - but overall I had the need for more. I thought the acting was average."
3,Not as good as the reviews,"Why do I have to write something, stars are enough.Not as good as the the star ratings would have you think"
1,Bad,"Smug. Predictible. Bland. Automatic. Boring.What if life really IS a video game? Then this crew will be right at home. They are pure good vs pure bad, though comic. They have everything figured out, almost as if the whole thing was a movie.But it's not. Not really. Not a real movie. A real movie would require blood on the tracks, not just a plastic hand."
1,obviously not foolproof,"as demonstrated by the numerous examples it has attracted to positive ratings...not worth half the 399 coppers i gave up to it, not even the plated zinc ones (what, you didn't KNOW that?)...this is going to leave a scar..."
2,Not Quite Foolproof,"After seeing the movie on cable, I can't understand why anyone would ever buy it. The review with 1 star is a bit harsh but very accurate (hence my ""2""). The movie is fun-ish but the story itself has more holes than a screen door. It held my attention for about the first 15-20 minutes then I watched the rest as I was folding laundry. I WAS FOLDING LAUNDRY DURING THIS MOVIE! I don't know how else to warn you. It's not horrible, mind you. It is simply way far behind in plot, direction, and to some degree- acting. Everyone mailed it in. The experience was similar to watching a bug zapper at night; there's something almost always happening, but nothing to really watch."
4,fool proof,FoolproofGreat twist at the end. If you like chess game type movies you will love this oneAmazon prime streaming movie
1,Blah! Blah!,"I couldn't make it through half of the movie. Reynolds is ok. But mostly annoying acting.As someone else said ""not engaging"". Or something like that."
4,Great Movie,"Great Movie, enjoyed it. If you are looking for a funny and suspenseful movie with twists then I recommend it."
3,Nothing Else On? See A Bank Robbery,"Yeah, I know. Another bank robber movie. This one is a somewhat new twist on the old trade of stealing from the thieves. Has a decent plot and story line, with an entertaining outcome."
2,predictable and boring,"I wasted my money renting this dud. Story was boring and acting was dull. I didn't care about any of it, never engaged me."
4,Foolproof w/ Ryan Reynolds,"The feel good little Canadian production that could. I happened to catch this on cable not long after it came out, then it seemed to disappear from TV/ cable. I finally broke down and got the dvd and have no regrets about it. It is a little humorous, seeing as I'm in the U.S., that the dvd cover is in both english and french, though it is required by Canadian law, lol. Starring then still up and coming Ryan Reynolds and David Suchet of Poirot fame as a sinister thief, this movie kept me thinking the whole time I was watching. It had some elements that reminded me of the how-did-they-do-that? of Oceans 11 and other movies like it."
4,foolproof,"Good movie, very entertaining, it feels like oceans 11 but with a different cast and smaller budget. Ryan Reynolds and cast pulled it off nicely"
4,good movie,pretty good movie for a free one. Both my wife and i liked it. I never heard of it until I browsed the Amazon prime movies.
3,It's Okay,Took a lot to keep my attention felt there could have been more to make this a great story but it was a great ending.
4,A fun movie to watch.,"It was just fun to watch. Not a high energy action packed movie, but interesting characters and good ending. Worth renting, but probably won't buy."
2,Predictable and Kind of Boring,"If you've seenSneakersplus *any* of the Ocean movies (11, 12, 13...) you've seen this movie. There is one twist, but it's visible from miles away. It looks nice, but wasn't very original or creative. It took me ages to finish watching it (streaming here on Amazon)."
4,enjoyable,"Sadly, Ryan did not take his shirt off in this movie. I did enjoy the plot twists and turns in this movie."
4,A pleasant surprise,So the beginning was pretty lame but I was very surprised how things turned out in the end. Not to mention that David Suchet was in the film....
4,Do you like the show Leverage?,"If your a fan of the TV show Leverage, you will like this movie. Its starts off a little slow, but gets better as the story progresses. I am glad to see Ryan Reynolds breaking into other roles besides comedy."
4,GREAT MOVIE,This was a good fun movie. I really enjoyed the way it ended. I will look for other movies with the same cast members.
2,Do not waste your time,"This movie was too boring to play in the background while studying. The story is contrived, the characters flat, the acting is decent but there is no story to tell."
4,bad DVD reproduction,"I'd agree with the above reviewer, and am adding detail here. Yes, it's a Chinese western; the homage to Sergio Leone is obvious, but he wouldn't be able to deal convincingly with a teenage romance, would he? I liked it, given that one wasn't going to get lots of high-flying martial-arts stuff a la Hong Kong. It's moody and yet sweet, very nicely shot -- at least as far as I could tell from this rather badly reproduced DVD. I'm pretty sure this was originally a widescreen movie, but on this release it's chopped to TV ratio (for an American TV broadcast), is rather blurry to look at (as if copied from video), and the introductory material by some guy in a suit is truly pathetic. (No extra features to speak of.) It feels like a real cheapo reproduction that traduces the visual values of the film; it would be really wonderful to see this re-released in a pristine, in-focus widescreen version."
5,The best sports story ever told!,I would like to go on and on about this book and even the movie. This is truly a moment in history that changed the sport of basketball. A great story about a great man in a great town!
5,At a bar in El Paso,"Don Haskins recalls his coaching days with Texas Western/UTEP as if he were having a conversation with you at a local bar in El Paso. Though Haskins is very modest (almost to a point of lying), Dan Wetzel keeps the man and his story in perspective."
5,the book and the movie...,are AWESOME!Haskins is a Pioneer! a fearless saint!Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
4,Helpful when you don't have time to research books,"To be truthful, there is little to be said about Maestro William Gaugler's Dictionary of Fencing Terminology since it's just that - a dictionary that no one should expect any more or less from. Though some will complain that Gaugler does not elaborate enough on certain terms, I find this book helpful to look up a quick term whenever I don't have time to skim the pages of fencing literature. It's very quick and easy to look through, and I'm also pleased that Gaugler takes the time to explain both French and Italian terms on a lot of the entries. The book is indeed small but it's sold at a cheap price and the cost should be of no concern to even the stingiest of fencers. I find this book particularly recommendable for those new to fencing who consistently worry that they've forgotten fencing terms."
1,Better than the Science of Fencing,Better than the Science of Fencing this dictionary can at least be useful.
4,"A bit flimsy, but it looks great","When I opened the box, I was only slightly surprised to feel how lightweight and fragile my FSM felt in my hands. Application was easy enough and it looks snazzy on my car. It's been on for a few weeks now and still hanging in there. Hopefully it lasts much longer than that and none of the plastic appendages break off. I only wish I could tell when fundamentalists were driving behind me. I have noticed a few more dirty looks and leadfoots, though..."
4,FSM ...for the win,Love his noodely appendages all over my car. The sticky part seems to be recessed and I am a little worried about how secure he will be when attached. Wife rolled her eyes and walked away when I opened the box so I know it was a good purchase.
5,Pastafarianism,My hubby has this on the back of his car. We even had a Pastafarian reception with the noodly one present.
2,Love the design but didn't even stick for 1 min.,i was super excited to put this on my car. I put it on it and I was very disappointed that it did not stay stuck to my car. I have now purchased strong adhesive tape with hopes I can still put it on my car. Disappointed
5,This is a great product!,"Flying Spaghetti Monster Car EmblemI bought my FSM emblem May 19th, 2009 and, sadly, lost it today. I traded my car in yesterday and went back to the dealership at 8:00 AM to retrieve my beloved FSM, and it was gone!Thanks to the Noodly Master (and Amazon), my replacement will be here tomorrow!By the way, I live in AZ and it lasted like new for all these years."
5,I was touched by his noodly appendage,"The Flying Spaghetti Monster car emblem is a nice addition to my car. I've placed it right above my bumper sticker that says, ""Dear Jesus, please protect me from your followers""."
5,rAmen!,"I've had this on my car for five years now. Holds up fine, is still shiny and I love it! rAmen!"
5,Confuse the person behind you,"I drive more politely now that I know I represent all Pastafarians. So if you buy this, you too will drive safer.Very durable so far."
5,high quality,"This is a high quality car emblem, chrome metal and enamel and the ENTIRE back surface is double sided tape. Just the kind of quality His Noodly Goodness deserves."
2,Looks good... but will it stay on my car??,"The emblem looks great (although it seems a little large), but is a bit pricey for something that is a) lightweight plastic and b) very likely to fall off my car and disappear: it attaches via what looks like plain 'ol doublestick tape behind the body. The legs are not attached at all, and I just don't see how this is going to stay attached for any length of time.I converted mine to a fridge magnet and settled for a bumpersticker of His Noodly Goodness for my car."
2,Flying Spaghetti Monster Car Emblem,"This would be fine at half the price, but $10 is quite steep for flimsy plastic. At least it looks fine from a distance."
5,Funny,"Looks good, attaches easily, and his hilarious. My mom liked it (although she just thought it looked nice)."
5,Spread the TRUTH,"Great conversation starter, very spot on in its design when compared to the jesus fish, and irresistably cute. Perfect gift!"
2,larger than expected and cheap plastic,"This is larger than you would expect and is made of cheap plastic, if it were a little smaller I would have put it on my car but it looks stupid at this size."
4,Believe in his noodle-ness and be saved!,"It's a FSM chrome-colored plastic decal. Where else are you going to find one of these for FSM aficionados? No where.Only problem is, most people will have no idea what ""FSM"" stands for. They are many lost souls among the heathens."
5,"Great item, but beware of idle hands.","I purchased this item nearly a year ago, and it was everything I imagined. I proudly displayed it everywhere I went, until one day it disappeared from my possession. Reading through the other reviews I'm not the only one to experience this problem. I loved the item and it held up much better than I expected (I live in Utah where we have 2 temperatures: Very Hot and Bitter Cold; neither of them showing any sign of phasing His Holiness) but ultimately His demise came at the hand (or fingertips) of someone who hopefully took him to a better place where they too can praise his noodley appendages."
4,Good Quality & Good Value,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and quantity of the papaya from Wild Oats. I would definately recommend them. Just note that they do have added sugar.
4,Great Device... no longer supported,"I bought one of these great little devices when they came out. Attach a pair of powered speakers to it, or plug it into your stereo and you have expanded your digital music capabilities. Mine sits on my home network and plays both radio and iTunes out of a pair of Logitech X-230 2.1 computer speakers. Nice set-up. Too bad Roku got successful with streaming Netflix Video to your television becuse they have basically abandoned this product and any support for it. I was playing FLAC files using the Firefly Music Server software that was developed to help the Roku function with something other than iTunes, and that has not been updated in three years. It no longer work with OS X after 10.5A shame, really. But it still plays radio."
2,Truly pathetic customer support,"I bought this for one purpose: to hook it up to my stereo system and listen to Internet radio stations around the world. It does it's main function fairly well, but their website which is required for that functionality is down several times a year, sometimes as long as 3 days. They also have no more online support or even online documentation. I can understand moving on, but getting rid of all documentation, etc, at your website?! There is a workaround to get it work with the website down, but it's a bit clumsy, and I haven't really tested it during website failure. The manual is incomplete, and I still don't understand half the buttons. Again, functionality is decent, but you expect a bit more by way of customer support in this day and age. Also, as several have noted the product has been dropped, and this company has made it very clear it's not much interested in supporting an older product like this one."
3,S/PDIF Optical Out Problem,"SB1001 plays great, but sounds even GREATER when connected via optical out to my external DAC.The problem however is that when you turn the Soundbridge off, the digital out (red light) stays ON so it's constantly sending an output signal. This prevents my DAC from ever going into standby mode! Roku user forum on their website has a post on this problem from back in 2005 and it's yet to be corrected.Other posts on the forum indicate a lack of support for enhancements and bug fixes (frustration) from quite a few other owners.Buyer beware!"
2,Unsupported; doesn't see all songs on my server,"After my media collection on my home media server (HP Media Vault) grew past about 5000 songs, this device would fail to recognize songs in albums. I would add a new album, browse to it, and see only some of the songs in the album. All other software (iTunes, Rhythmbox, etc) saw all the songs correctly. It seemed to me that the device was incapable of receiving the full song listing from the media server.I tried to get help from Roku, but they were unresponsive in their forums and customer service channels.I sold the Soundbridge on eBay; it was too hard to use anyway. Now I have a Blu-Ray player that also supports streaming media servers, and I can point it at the Media Vault and play my music through it instead."
1,Bait and Switch?,Endless Variety canceled the order with no explanation. I was counting on giving this as a present.
1,Company knowingly sells faulty products and has bad customer service.,"I don't own this product but another one from the same company - a Roku R1000 internet radio.We loved the product while it worked but recently the power supply died after less than 2 years. Of course it's out of warranty and the company won't even respond to questions on how to send it for repair. Look at http://forums.rokulabs.com and you will find many other customers with exactly the same problem - some of them are now talking about filing a class action lawsuit. Although my experience was with another one of their products, not this one, ask yourself: Would you want to buy a product from a company which has a track record of selling a faulty product and not making amends to their customers?"
4,A MAGNIFICENT LEGACY--BUT SOFT TRANSFERS,"Barbara Stanwyck, in her long and productive career, has left a vast legacy that includes almost every genre imaginable. This set is a magnificent tribute to her acting skills. The scripts are uniformly excellent.So why the four stars? The remastering department has given us transfers that are somewhat soft in nature. Edges are not as sharp as they could be. Compare these transfers with those of the Perry Mason series, The Fugitive, and Burkes Law, anthologies from this same time period, and you can discern the differencesHigh definition and Blu-Ray have spoiled us. The higher resolutions offered today serve to create a more demanding audience that is becoming evermore sensitive to picture quality.My Oppo 83 DVD/Blu-Ray player does a magnificent job in upscaling standard material. It is limited only by the content being played."
5,Stellar cast and terrific acting!,I remember seeing reruns of two or three episodes of this series about 20 years ago on an independent TV station and truly enjoyed them. I'm looking forward to the DVD collection. Barbara Stanwyck was a fine actor!
4,Superlative,"A fan of Stanwyck since I was a child and saw the Big Valley then grew up to see her classic films including Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers--this show is suprisingly contemporary with excellent scripts, surprising guest stars and Stanwyck's emotional range on vivid display.And I have to say whoever did her wardrobe surely deserved accolades as well, the gowns are magnificent at the beginning of the show and her wardrobe for the ""Little Jo"" episodes is distractingly sexy."
5,Miller in Early '39 - Sounding Great at the Meadowbrook,"This is possibly the best live Glenn Miller CD from 1939 that I've heard. The band sounds good, with virtually the same personnel that they had at the Glen Island Casino a couple of months later. (Cody Sandifer on drums instead of Moe Purtill on most of these performances is the only major exception. Sandifer does a fine job.) The resonant acoustics of the Meadowbrook give a fuller sound than the band got in its studio recordings at the time - check the opening ""Moonlight Serenade"" as an example, one of the best versions I've heard. The songs are well chosen, and we get here one complete broadcast and almost all of another, so the ""you are there"" feeling is well preserved. Marion Hutton sings better than usual on ""Romance Runs in the Family,"" Ray Eberle no better than usual for '39 (though he improved a lot later). Very much worth getting for the GM fan who wants the interest of live performances at one of the band's best periods."
4,Not Bad But I Still Prefer Complete Behind the Wheel French,"Christian Aubert's SmartFrench isn't really all that bad. Sure, it can be tough to decipher and it does get boring at times.I just go away from every session knowing and learning less(and feeling a lot more pain) than when I listen to my Behind the Wheel French Complete 9 CCs.True. Behind the Wheel French cost $49.00 but it is really well worth the money.These CDs are lively and chocked full of instruction compared to good ol' Christian."
1,I'm confused,I have not been able to figure out this program. All levels seem to be scrambled in one. Lacking in clear instructions. or is it just me?
1,"COMPLETE CRAP, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!","I gave up on this after a week or so. It's extremely difficult to follow and the words are spoken to quickly. Add a little extra and buy an interactive learning CD ROM rather than an audio disc. With no visual aid or english translation (unless you care to sit with the instruction booklet on your lap whilst driving), it makes learning extremely difficult and boring. I used an interactive CD ROM to start Spanish and found it much more informative as it had visual stimulation. Smart French did make an ideal target for plinking with my air gun!!"
1,Not what I expected,I did not find this particular set of CDs to be helpful. I would not recommend it.
4,"Very good overall, but one irritating feature...","This CD helped me a lot. They interview french people from various walks of life. You listen to the interview as read by the french narrator, and then after repeating it phrase by phrase, you listen to the actual conversation of the person who was interviewed. The conversation (even the narrated one) is pretty fast, therefore the real thing, which I liked. However, the thing that really bothered me about this CD is that the explanations are incredibly basic: for instance pronunciation and grammar instruction that any rank beginner would know! Eg: ""Je, followed by ai, becomes J'ai."" ""C'est means it is"" !! This kind of stuff is throughout the CD, even when you get to the advanced section! However, if you just cue through that inanity on your CD player you will get a lot out of this series."
3,Interesting Product,"SmartFrench is an ok program. I think that by using it you will be able to understand a little more when some french people speak. I liked that they placed the letters that you do not pronounce in red. Some of the prononuciations are a little different to what I learnt in school though. What I don't like about this program is that when they ask you to repeat after the speaker in the advanced section of the program, you are not given sufficent time to repeat what is been said before they move on to the next sentence. Overall, not a bad program, but a bit expensive (c'est tres cher)."
1,personal opinion,"Do not buy this package if you do not have a very solid knowledge of french grammar and know to speak french well.It will not help you.The package is designed to improve the pronanciation and speaking ability in French for the people who already have good knowledge of french language.A better solution will be a French course with more lessons,new grammar rules for each of these, and audio CDs spoken by native speaking french people for these lessons"
3,Valley Girl French,"Over the years I had about seven years of French, most of it literature courses, and I have visited France, Belgium, and Quebec many times. I can get along but not well enough to conduct interviews or handle question periods after a lecture, though every year I spend a certain amount of time with grammars and tapes. I was delighted to read the glowing reviews of Smart French and worked through the lessons more than once. It did help me to understand cab drivers and students, but when I tried some of what I had learned in the company of educated French people in an out of Paris, they held their ears and wanted to know where I learned to speak such a low-class gutter language. The course is well worth the money and very useful for learning to understand what people are saying on the street, especially the young, but, in the company of educated adults, you may come across, dude, as a refugee from Dumb and Dumber or Fast Times at Ridgemont High."
1,Not helpful,"Found these CDs and booklet to be useless. It consists of awkward conversations that are made of endless broken phrases. As far as I'm concerned, a poor product."
3,"Good, but could be better!","It is a good tape for people who want to learn advanced french. However, for most of the recordings it is the same person speaking and his voice becomes tired and this makes trying to understand what he is trying to say more difficult. Also, you do not get much variation on how different people speak french, since most of the time it is only one person. I would say if you would like to save money, learn advanced french some other way like listening to french radio."
4,"Listening and understanding, an essential skill","It goes without saying that listening is an essential skill to practice when learning a foreign language. I'm really glad that these cd's were available! This method whereby a script is available for reference (later), color-coded to indicate dropped sounds, and with English parallel text, is very well helpful for me as a language learning tool. Seeing the various conjugations also helps me to see how the speaker is using the language. Have you ever been to a foreign movie, wishing that the subtitles were in the native language? Here's that kind of practice, broken down for the listener with the reference book! I'm grateful to supplement learning with this tool, thanks to Christian Aubert... To the producer: Maybe you could produce a set with the use of the subjunctive, it's one of those concepts that takes a while for us English speakers to embrace!"
1,Anoushka: Harsh criticism?,Anoushka is facing harsh criticism for her music. Reading a plethora of views one cannot help but agree with the people who seem to lend perspective to a tradition of music regarding which they are somewhat knowledgable. I am not a trained scholar of the music but familiar enough to at least understand that Anoushka's music is totally substandard. But for the fact that she is Ravai Shankar's daughter such musicianship could never have made it into a concert or recording setting! The previous reviewer is correct in pointing out that there are many American students of the music who show sincerety and seriousness in their playing.
1,Anoushka Shankar,"I have to unfortunately agree with the last reviewers comments on Anoushka! Anoushka and her music is commercialism at its best! Sadly this is encouraged by her guru, father and a wonderful musician. Please Ravi Shankarji, do not credit this as one of your great musical legacies!!"
1,A sham recording!,I wish I could give it a zero star; there is no provision for that here! There is a complete lack of conscience in letting substandard artists get onto center stage purely on the stature of the parent. Any such musical standard in India would be considered far below average!
2,Not ready,"Indian classical music is incredibly complex, utilizing many modes. She uses a limited number of modes and licks that become redundant. Maybe in 20 or 30 years, she will master the music. Her note selection is novice. Getting something from a recognized master of the instrument would be a far greater investment."
2,Reviews and talent!,"I am a long time follower and admirer of Indian music and after reading all the reviews posted on this site, I was curious to gives this cd a try. Sorry to say that I found it to be uninteresting and much of the music sounds composed!"
1,Only Father's Grace!!,"I read one of the long reviews posted here and had to agree with many of the points made. At 20 Anoushka is not a child and much more needs to be seen of her individuality which is absent in her playing. The various pre-composed pieces in different ragas (along with the deliberate distraction of two tablas) have become a routine affair in her recordings and concerts. There is not a scintilla of feeling or improvisation in her rendition of ragas and there are many years still in the making! I attended Ravi Shankar and Anoushka's concert in Calcutta (2 years ago) and the same criticism was made by audiences and the press alike! There are a number of exceptional talents in Indian music (many in their early teens) and it is only through the grace of her father's name that Anoushka can get by (at least for now!) with such a gutsy display of averageness!! On a positive note, isn't it encouraging that we can produce intelligent music criticism about Indian Music in the West??!!"
4,A Great Story To Share,"I think that My Stolen Innocence by Lynnora Sumblin is an uplifting and triumphant story of one woman's ascension to sanctity and power. Lynnora endured years of sexual abuse and as a result of that abuse, she suffered from mental illness. However, through her faith for God, she was able to overcome her problems and begin a life of promise and hope. This book is a testament to those who might have given up, but somehow discovered the courage they possess to take back their lives, just as Lynnora did. My Stolen Innocence is an undeniable book of therapy, strength and faith."
4,"God bless Lynora who is now ""free at last!""","A book that gives healing to the wounded, hope to the hopeless, and faith to know that you are not alone. I admire the author for having the courage to come forth and express such unmentionable events in her life. This testimony will help thousands of victims who have been through situations such as Lynora's.I am glad to know that now she can take care of her son, whom is so dear to her. I, too, am a parent, and I am raising a child alone. Lynora has such a love for the Lord, and without Him, she would not have been able to share her life with others.You go girl!"
2,"poignent tale, poorly written","I was struck by the complexity of what the author had to go through in managing this disorder. I was disappointed, however, in the writing, which is disjointed and very hard to follow. I credit the author with her life endeavors, I just wish she had received help overall with the editing prior to publishing."
2,Not a good choice,"I like books about ancient manuscripts, ancient relics, ancient secrets, which is both a good and a bad thing since there seems to be lots of this type of book being written now but not all are good, like this one. It seems as if the author was ordered to chop down a much longer book but refused to alter the plot; therefore, what's left are very shallow and unsympathetic characters, strange relationships that are never properly developed and overly long lectures that I didn't care enough about to make any sense out of. The most aggravating part is the core of the plot -- that the icon is real. I found no convincing proof, but the protagonist is willing to risk life and limb for it."
1,Splintered,100 pages to many. The journal adventure could have been done in 2 chapters. More time could have been spent on the adventure to find the relic. This was not one of my best reads in the hunt for a Jesus item
3,Good Story Line,The characters were not well developed but I thought the story line very clever! I like the way it moved in time through different centuries and how the opening scene really occurred near the end of the story. It made for some confusion at first but I loved the way he wrapped it up.
1,Poor taste,"Before you buy this, you should be aware that within the first 15 minutes there is a gang rape of an adolescent male by three women, surrounded by a crowd of people milling about. Poor taste is an understatement. I am not watching the whole thing. I shudder to think what they did to the scene when Desdemona is murdered. I certainly would not have bought this DVD had I known this; I am trading it in today. Buyer beware."
2,"It's okay, but different from on the video.","This puppet is different from the one on the video. It's dark and textured. The tongue doesn't roll out of the mouth very easily because of the texture. It's kind of shiny, too. It's even too big for my husband's hand, and he's about 200 lbs. My daughter isn't thrilled over it, but she plays with it a little. I'd check ebay for a better deal though, because I just can't see spending the money on one that isn't very close to the one on the video."
4,My daughter loves this dragon,"My 2 year old daughter loved this dragon on her baby einstein video so I purchased the puppet for her for Christmas and she loves to wear it on her hand and go up to people and say ""blah"". She has lots of fun with it."
4,Perfect for Teaching,"When you don't have the luxury of a piano, this collection works well for teaching elementary levels of ballet."
4,Very Interesting,I am a full-time firefighter and fire investigator and felt obligated to read this book. It was very interesting and informative but some stuff was a little complicated for me to understand or believe. The question of spontaneous human combustion is not absolutely proven at the conclusion of the book but plenty of food for thought. Also a very thick book requiring a little extra time to read.
5,"Excellent, excellent book...","I'm so very impressed with all the ""cases"" Larry has reviewed... He even found a little known one from my own hometown that has never been mentioned before in any publication I've ever read. Nan Mann"
1,Filled with speculation and no facts,"With the credentials of a bus driver, the author obviously had no clue what he was REALLY trying to explain. Common sense explains most of the book here.....not some human ""phenomenon."" I'll give the book some credit that it documents the SHC cases well but on the other hand doesn't look at the common sense aspect that should be applied to Arnold's theories. This book can be shoved away with the rest of those TimeLife Mysteries of the Unknown books."
1,pseudoscience at it's worst,"this guy spouts the SHC myth at it's worst. i read this book years ago and it's way too far out in left field. SHC simply cannot happen. it violates several rules of chemistry, physics, thermodynamics and logic. This topic is covered very well in most arson textbooks. I have degrees in fire protection technology and fire investigation technology and am a master firefighter/fire inspector/fire investigator. I have taught fire science chemistry and fire dynamics at the college level. don't waste your time."
3,"An hour for magic, two days for reading","An Hour For Magic, originally published a mere 11 years after the subject's death, presents not only a delightfully disorganized account of Jim Morrison's life, but also a charmingly realistic view of the often turbulent times in which he lived. Unfortunately, the book's narration does, at times, follow the beaten path of countless others by escalating Jim's person into that of a demi-god through mystical embellishment (""On stage...Jim [became] a shaman, a wizard, a sorcerer, a magician, a medicine man, a witch doctor, an enchanter and a Dionysian reveler."") Still, if one manages to see through the haze of mystics applied to the rockstar's life, there lies a rewarding read in store - one filled with exquisite personal recollections by Jim's friend Frank Lisciandro of anecdotes and conversations surely deemed inconsequential by the more impersonal biographers."
4,The Stone Coyotes - Fire It Up,"Fire It Up rips through my speakers with an unqualified energy, as all Stone Coyote albums do. And as on all of their releases, there are a couple of standout tracks, tracks that are so sensationally original, and beholding to no one, that they're sure to go down in musical history as some of the best laid back, haunting, ride you into the setting sun with home just an endless few more miles down a dusty road adventure. ""All Dressed Up,"" and ""Dance Band"" are songs you'll wanna keep in your pockets like so much loose change, tossing them across the bar like lightening, and firing up any sleepy roadhouse that needs a kick in the shins. I've poured you a shot, and here's a quarter for the jukebox, now let's see ya shake the dust off of those jeans.Review by Jenell Kesler"
2,Not my thing,"Barbara Keith has a unique and interesting voice but, man, the monotonous (literally) melodies leave me clawing the walls for some harmonic release. After a while these songs start sounding like an auction or a horse race narration. I'd love to hear her tackle some more melodic tunes, especially with a tighter and more skilled rhythm section."
4,A very handy kitchen tool... I don't know why I went so long without one!,"Great little scraper. It's sturdy with a nice weight, and the handle is comfortable. I make a lot of breads and pastry doughs, and this scraper functions well as a cutter to divide the dough. It also works pretty well to scrape up chopped veggies and get them into a pot. However, the blade is a little on the small side."
5,Great little tool,"I give it 5 stars for scraping but if I needed the numbers printed on the blade, well, they wore off. I don't know whether I accidentally scrubbed them off or the dishwasher suds were too rough. It doesn't matter to us because we don't use the numbers, but if you do, be a little more gentle cleaning it."
5,Top of the line,I've had 3 scrapers and I can honestly say this is the BEST of them. I crushes from vegetables to dough so easily. The handle allows a very firm grip. Not heavy or too big. It wonderful and I reccommend it without a doubt.
5,Wonderful movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was emotionally deep and a very heartfelt story line. If you've every been in a difficult situation, like portrayed in the film, it really enlightens you on how family should pull together when there is a crisis, instead of apart. Very good movie..."
4,The last record,"I still listen to Botch like it's brand new. They were THAT far ahead of their time in my opinion. Few bands were so technical while retaining a true punk/hardcore sound.That being said, I feel that this EP is not a proper send-off. It doesn't come close to ""We Are the Romans"" or even songs from ""American Nervoso"". I'd say the only song that grabbed me was ""Vietmam"" which, ironically, I consider one of Botch's best songs.I suggest the listener plays it straight through as it blends rather well from track to track. It's not a bad record, but it only leaves me hoping for what could've been."
4,3M + Money,"The book has great revelance for all concerned residents of the Garden State. The author traces the forces that brought forth the creation of 566 local towns,the cost of running so many political subdivisions, how local governments are maintained (through elevated property taxes and sprawl/ratables race)and makes a great case for changing this political system.The book is a fanastic blend of history, political intrigue and candid insights about institutionalized housing and employment discrimination against African-American, the poor, and now-families with school aged children.The author even is so bold as to take on the notion of Home Rule. Showing that it is more of a ""political"" huddle (set up by special interest groups) rather than a real ""legal"" impediment to change. The author also attacks the ""entrenched system"" for allowing public officials to hold multiple political offices at once.Overall this is an outstanding work by someone truly concerned with the future of his state."
4,Why NJ is the way it is,"Alan Karcher has done a remarkable job of explaining why NJ has as many municipalities (566) as it does for such a small state. Most of the reasons were petty and personal. Most were set for racial, ethnic, or religious reasons. Some were set up to keep out the wrong economic types. Most of these municipalities could not exist if the state government did not help them with money. Karcher has done a great job of offering a historical perspective of the state that started when our country was young and continues to today. He also has offered his vision of how to fix what is wrong with the system. Personally as a resident of NJ, I think that I could make ice cubes in very hot places before NJ changes its way of doing things. If you want to know why NJ is the way that it is and why it happened, then this is a great read. Karcher is also very knowledgeable of the inside workings of the state because he was the assembly leader during much of the 1980's."
4,A good read,"Bodyguard was a good read. The characters were fully realized, the writing was excellent. I'm sorry to say that the book never really gained my full attention. I found myself skipping pages. The hero was your typical tortured hero and I liked his character. The secondary characters almost stole the show and held my interest more than the main characters. As for the heroine, I've read better.<G> Her focus on her looks was rather annoying. I thought her shallow and silly. A good read but I've read better from Brockmann and haven't given up on her. HEARTHROB is still tops with me. Brockmann, when she's good, the woman is good. I've enjoyed her Navy SEAL titles like Prince Joe, Harvard's Education, It Came Upon A Midnight Clear and The Admiral's Bride. Brockmann is a very talented writer and I am definately looking forward to her longer, more involved Navy SEAL, full length novel."
4,I read it to my husband,"To keep my husband alert during a long drive and not wanting to do any driving myself, I started reading this book aloud. Having never read any of this author's books, I really didn't know what I was getting us into. We both enjoyed her vivid attention to detail, her keen sense of humor and editorializing, and her clever style. My husband chuckled as much as I did. Who cares if Alessandra liked makeup and clothes and Harry was a little too short? Read beyond the characterizations and enjoy the charismatic story that brings these two love-lost characters together."
4,I liked it!,"I found the characters interesting. The pain Harry felt when Shaun confronted him was heartbreaking. I appreciated the change that Allie went through from beauty to substance. And that Harry was man enough to see past the looks. I was left feeling kind of sad for George, Kim and Nic. I hope that Ms. Brockmann decides to devote a future book to resolving these people in need of a love like Harry and Allie. I will look for other books by Ms. Brockmann. I have found her writing to be true and very moving."
3,"Very good, but not great","I enjoy Ms. Brockmann's writing. I don't think this will be my favorite, though. I liked the heroine, Alessandra. I thought her transformation from dependent trophy wife to strong, resourceful woman was very good. For Harry, the hero, all I kept seeing was Mel Gibson in the first Lethal Weapon movie. Undoubtedly that's just me, but it still felt very familiar. I liked Heart Throb better - Jed's pain and growth touched me more deeply. Regardless, I look forward to Ms. Brockmann's future efforts."
2,"Little romance, some action","Like many others, I really enjoyed Heartthrob last year. Maybe expectations were too high, but I was bored with this one. It reminded me of action movies, that have too little plot. And frankly, that business with the Azalea bush almost had me throwing the book right there. Maybe, if you've read it, you understand. Harry and Alessandra never seem to be in love. Harry's partner and his problems, would have made a better love story. And, I found the trip to visit the children, not only an obvious hiding place, but also an unwelcome side trip for me, the reader. Sorry, but a big no, for me. 2 stars because it's by an author I've liked in the past."
1,uuuuggghhh!,"This book really bothered me. But considering how Ms.Brockmann has written more great books then awful books, then I can forgive her for this one. First of all I did not like Alessandra, she got on my last nerve, maybe it's jealousy but maybe I should let all the romance authors know something about me. I HATE READING ABOUT WOMEN WHO ARE BETTER LOOKING THEN I AM! also, no offense or anything, but Harry was not my idea of a hero. I guess I am a little fickle but I want my romance men to be big, buff, and beautiful, and from my estimation Harry was none of those, he was interesting but did he have to be short, with a big nose, and a lawn mower haircut. Oh well I guess I'll read Heartthrob again and wait for Ms. Brockmann's next book. Just because I didn't like this one doesn't mean I won't read anymore of hers."
3,Good...but not Great!,"This book was good. I personally liked alot of Suzanne Brockmann's other books alot better. For instance, ""The Admiral's Bride"" was a great book! Bodygaurd was average. I did not find the main characters very likeable! Alessandra was annoying...Harry was better, but not much. This story has been done to many times to count!"
2,UNCONVINCING,"Try as I would, I couldn't get up much enthusiasm for Alessandra and Harry. She wasn't convincing. He was, but I was a lot more interested in the rest of his life than I was in his relationship with Alessandra. I found the suspense part hokey and unconvincing. Ms. Brockmann's earlier HEARTTHROB was a lot better read."
2,Didn't work with my keyboard,"I ordered a few of these, because USB keyboards sometimes don't work with programs that boot into DOS mode (such as hard-drive scanning utilities).However, I was disappointed to find out that these do not work with my Microsoft Comfort Curve keyboard. After some discussion with the seller, they sent me out another adapter (purple in color, like the PS/2 color code for keyboards) but that did not work either. The pinout is apparently the same on both adapters, so we didn't expect it would make a difference.Apparently some keyboards do not support the USB/PS2 conversion, so be aware of that when buying these adapters."
1,they didn't work with my IBM M-type keyboard and a mac,"the (much more expensive) adaptors sold by clickykeyboards ended up working with my M-type keyboard. (I have a M13- I got it from e-bay - NOS. It is awesome)from what I understand, the old M-types are touchier about this sort of thing than most keyboards, so these things might work for other keyboards."
1,Adapters didn't work,I wanted to plug a usb keyboard and a usb mouse into the unused PS2 ports to get back the two usb ports but neither would work when I plugged them in.
1,Terrible Product,"Simply put, this product does NOT work. I hate that I even have to rate this one star because it deserves zero stars. Sending it back would cost more than it is worth, which is $0. Do NOT buy this product if you expect to plug a USB device into the PS2 port. Very disappointing."
1,Didn't work with my mouse or keyboard,Be warned this may not work with your peripherals -- it didn't with mine.
2,be careful,"This Tv would be great if all I was going to do was watch tv. unfortunately not. I needed a small cheap TV for my dorm room to hookup my playstation 2. Unfortunately no audio/video inputs. So now i have to buy an adapter, and that means worse quality."
3,help,"i just bought a magnovox 19"" tv about 2 hours ago...it is locked on a certain channel and the store didnt give me a booklet so i dont know how to unlock it so i can only get one channell.......i need the booklet for this tv philips magnovox 19 inch pr 1906c help....it isnt even stuck on a decent channel"
5,This Book is Like a Conversation With a Best Friend,This book was selected as the Book of The Month by the Washington Post. It's wonderful. The best way to describe it is as a caring conversation with a best friend that makes you feel good and laugh at times but has the right dose of reality checks about how to eliminate your pain and find your path in life to have more joy. Reading the snipets about other peoples stories and money troubles was like financial voyerism but it made me feel better about my own life. This book was just what I needed.
5,Perfect,"Detailed maps, high quality information and rigorous approach, not to mention leaving completely the term E Europe deserves 5 stars."
3,"A good reference, but only a reference","This book does what it should do. It provides easily read maps of the area between Berlin and Ismir showing the political situation in the region from the Roman era to the contemporary one. However, this is not one of those atlases that can really be read like a book. There is a lot of text, but it mostly is of the ""Prussia acquired Silesia from Austria in 1742"" variety. The book deals almost entirely with territorial matters, not with social ones. For example, there are maps for each country in the region showing boundary changes since World War I. However, there is nothing about the rise of authoritarianism in Central Europe in the interwar period, the installation of Communist regimes afterward or the fall of Communism in 1989-91. The author only discusses such things so far as they affect international and intranational boundaries."
4,"Beware! Same Group, Same Title, Two Different Albums.","I own both the 1976 Passport Records and the 1985 Windham Hill LPs (I do not own the Windham Hill CD). They are NOT the same! The 1976 version is much more frantic, electric, and progressive. Assuming you have access to both, check out 6 minutes into The Book of Hours: the lyricon solo is missing on the Windham Hill version. That solo was rough, grating, unique, and really defined early Shadowfax. Even the title cut has the tempo mellowed for the Windham Hill version. There are other differences. Which is better? Personally, I prefer the original. Good luck finding it.For album details, Mr. McKenna's review summed it up well. He had the 1976 version.I've only heard bits and pieces of other Shadowfax albums, and found them painfully boring in comparison.PS Somebody mentioned bonus tracks? How about both versions released together?"
1,absolutely useless,"although its a great idea, the CDROM is absolutely useless as a photo reference. this goes for figure drawing and other uses of the figure. the closeups are grainy at best and the navigation nothing more that a novelty without high resolution. the tutorial has some merit for just beginning, but not really useful beyond a very short introduction. i am embarassed to admit that i was lured into buying this book."
2,Disappointing,"To call this book/CD set the ""Ultimate Visual Reference"" is a wildly imaginative overstatement. Given that there are only 2 models in a variety of -STATIC- poses, and given that the images are not high resolution so particular body parts can be studied, I would call this a ""basic"" or ""limited"" reference at best. The book and CD are nicely presented, but the content is far from what I expected. The inclusion of music is unnecessary- more resolution and images a la Muybridge would have improved this concept immeasurably."
1,A travesty on every level,"What were they thinking??? This is one of the most poorly cast movies in the history of Hollywood. Laurence Harvey is supposed to be a Texan, but he doesn't look like a cowboy/farmer and can't do the accent. Jane Fonda is supposed to be a 16 year old Texan, but she doesn't look 16 and can't do the accent either. Anne Baxter is supposed to be a Mexican -- yeah, right. And we're supposed to believe that Barbara Stanwyck, with her New York accent, runs a New Orleans Cat House? Puh-leeez!!! There's not one genuine southern accent in the entire film. The story is totally uninvolving, the characters are unbelievable and, except for Baxter, unsympathetic. The direction is all over the place, and the art direction fails to evoke the 1930s. Don't waste your time or money on this misbegotten abortion."
4,"Tame by today's standards, but...","I was pretty young when I first saw this movie on television on a late show. The musical score and the tragic conclusion stayed with me. I own the video now a good 25+ years later, and it still affects me the same way. I have always been a fan of Barbara Stanwyck, and her performance here does not dissapoint. Despite Mr. Harvey's and Ms. Baxter's seriously contrived ""accents"" (texan and mexican respectively), the movie is very watchable. If you like the ""old school"" way of movie making, back when a little something was left to the imagination, then this movie is a good addition to your collection."
3,"yeah, its alright","is it hardcore? is it rock? is it punk? i just don't know. but it sure is catchy. i've been told these guys sound like lifetime, turning point, dag nasty...even in my eyes. but i haven't ever actually heard them. do yourselves a favor, or perhaps an anti favor, and pick this up...or don't."
4,Typical Disney of the era,Hayley Mills at her best. The story is simple and fun and you will find that you are enjoying it in spite of yourself. This is Hayley as she was entering her late teens so there is even a little romance. Great supporting cast and lots of fun bits throughout.
5,One of Mill's best!,"Summer Magic was the movie I fell in love with Haley Mills. I know own all of her movies (I think) and always stop to catch up on her when she is in the news. This movie has everything that a good movie should possess. A great family film that a parent can trust their kids to watch. It has an outstanding cast and the score is out of sight. To this day, I still sing the songs under my breath when doing something. So for all the parents who are looking for a great wholesome movie to show your children, Summer Magic is the perfect choice."
3,"Small problem, easily fixed","When I opened the movie, one of the plastic pieces that holds the disc in place was broken. I watched the movie and there were no problems so I store it in a CD case instead."
5,Summer Magic DVD,The Summer Magic DVD was perfect. It was of excellent quality and arrived in a timely manner. Thanks! Richard Stepp
4,A charming film for children,"I am quite of fan of Hayley Mills' and love all of the movies I have seen her in. She was still charming and wonderful in Summer Magic, but the film was definitely aimed at younger children (I am 15). A silly movie, however, for a few laughs."
3,Great start...ends weak...,"This movie started out great. Great story, great character building, and then whammo!!!! It is almost as if the story writer(s) got bored with the storyline and decided to quickly write up an ending just to end the movie. What a shame!!! It was good up until the ""Femininity!"" song. After that it fell apart quickly and left a lot of loose ends leaving the viewer with a lot of unanswered questions."
2,Summer Magic is not so magic,This is the third of Hayley Mills pictures for Walt Disney and is the weakest by far. Pollyanna and The Parent Trap are superb pictures but Summer Magic is just not in the same class. Hayley is great but the chemistry and story just don't work.
4,Love it!,"I love this movie! Brings back wonderful childhood memories, and I'm glad my daughter still loves it. Hayley Mills, as always, gives a great performance and it's just an all around cute, good family movie. A rare find in this day and age."
4,summer magic,this was a great movie. i would tell everyone to watch. its about a family that loses everything and moves to a small town and starts a new life they learn a little summer magic on the way which helps them out
2,lame and cheesy,"I purchased this because I liked Trouble with Angels and Pollyanna, the Chalk Garden and even Parent Trap. I had never heard of this movie and in a moment of nostalgia decided to purchase it based on its high reviews. This movie was clearly a vehicle meant to capitalize on Mill's popularity in better more deserving movies, but in itself it is just awful. The story makes no sense and has no real resolution. The singing is abysmal and made me wince. Every Disney hackneyed device was thrown into this movie, and that and a bad script pulled it down. I'm sorry I believed the reviews. Hayley Mills was a wonderful child actress, but nothing could save this vehicle. If you like the worst of Disney cheese, you'll love this. Otherwise steer clear."
1,Did I miss something?,"I was really looking forward to seeing this Disney Classic, however, when I received it I found out that the disc can not be played in my region. Maybe it's a fluke, but I tried it in two dvd players at two different houses, and got the same message. I've gone back to the product description and, maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see where it says that the disc can not be watched in the U.S. Really not happy with this purchase."
4,Classic Haley Mills,"This movie is classic Halley Mills, with the touch of Burl Ives. If you love Halley or Burl you will love this movie."
5,Spans generations,"I loved this movie as a girl and even more when I watched it with my girls. They were constantly singing ""walk feminine ... talk feminine ..."" and ""she's the pink of perfection"". They truly loved this movie. I made sure my children always saw all Disney favorites of mine as well as the new ones of theirs. But Hayley Mills was just naturally a favorite. The family situations and caring seemed so real to all of us. They often used some of the lines in their own lives. It's a feel good movie with a lot of heart tugs. The Sherman Brothers music will definitely stick with you. Speaking for myself, it is a wonderful opportunity for our children to get to know the great talent of Burl Ives. It leaves you wanting to live in the ""big yellow house""."
1,I don't get it,"I am not a scrooge. I am a very sensitive person who cries at the drop of a hat. However, I just don't get this song! Shoes?I realize the kid is young, but what kid thinks a pair of shoes is going to make all the difference in the appearance of his mom if she dies? Maybe a dress...but then again, what child (a male no less) thinks of rushing out and getting something to make his mother more beautiful in case she meets Jesus? And come on....like the kid is really going to know what size shoe?I just think the lyrics are poorly timed, cheesy as all get out and I just gag when I hear it.The sad part is that this song, along with the likes of ""Simply Having A Wonderful Christmastime"" by John Lennon and ""Last Christmas"" by Wham, will go down in history and be played year after year as ""classics"".The thought of that is enough to make anyone say Bah Humbug!"
1,Worst Song Ever,"This is one of those special pieces of ""art"" that seems to divide people. Personally this is the worst song I've ever heard in my life. It is so maudlin, so horrendously awful, that I almost look forward to hearing it on the radio. Then I can share it with other people. ""Listen"", I shout, ""the worst song ever!"" Then I wonder about the people who like it. Who are these people? Like another reviewer, the first time I heard it, I thought it was a joke."
5,Christmas shoes cd,"This is an awesome Christmas cd. I bought it for the song Christmas shoes, about a little boy buying Christmas shoes for his dying mother. It is very touching and I enjoy the other songs as well. My favorite isChristmas shoes."
3,C.D.,"The c.d. was received quicky but it must have been a used c.d. After just two playings of the c.d, it skipped on several songs. UGH!!!! Next time I want a new item. I was not told it was used and it did not state that it was used. Not a very good impression for a first time user!!!!"
1,Do people actually take this seriously???,"When I first heard ""Christmas Shoes"" on the radio, I honestly thought it was a parody. To me, it seemed to run along the same lines as David Brant's Music video in ""The Office Christmas Special,"" or Eric Cartman's ""Swiss Colony Beef Log,"" from the South Park Christmas Album. All three of these songs are hilarious because their subject matter is about as rediculous as it gets, the music is overly sappy with a chord structure that could be written by a twelve year old, and the singing is so overemotional that one can't help but laugh.The problem with ""Christmas Shoes"" is that it's serious. It makes me sad that music like this can be a hit while so many talented musicians and song writers are struggling to get by.I'm sure the members of Newsong are fine people, but it blows me away that music like this can be taken seriously by anyone."
1,"manipulative, to say the least","I'm normally the first to get teary-eyed at sentimental things, but the song ""Christmas Shoes"" smacked of manipulation.Painted a picture of a little boy, dirty from ""head to toe"", who goes into a store to buy some shoes for his ""mama"" who is going to die anytime soon, but he doesn't have enough money so the guy behind him feels compelled to buy the shoes for him.It wasn't poignant, even though it tried to be, even having the child sing the final chorus didn't do it for me.With all the beautiful, real, Christmas music there is, why oh why does the radio have to play this song 3 times a day?"
1,Hmmm ...,This is a tough score to call. It falls into the 'It's so bad it's almost good' category. There's a little piece of me that wants to score it higher than one star.But alas that would be more of an insult to Christmas than this song already is.Go home and give your dying mom a hug you little puke.
1,There is bad music....and then there's this!,"WOW. Christmas Shoes may be the WORST song that I have ever heard! Attention Newsong: Being a Christian band does not give you an excuse to ignore the guidelines of song writing like structure, lyrics that work with the music, and, of course, quality instrumentation. I would like to echo the sentiments of another reviewer who noted that many hard working musicians are stuggling to find success while junk like this finds it's way onto a record and then onto the radio. This song is so sappy sweet that I had to call Wilford Brimley to buy some of his diabetes medication. ""Christmas Shoes"" makes ""Simply Having a Wonderful Christmas Time"" sound like 'Stairway to Heaven'.This song is unacceptable; therefor, this album receives a 1 star rating."
5,unexpected emotion,"I was traveling to a friend's house on Christmas Eve. I was listening to my traditonal radio station that plays only Christmas music. This song came on and I kept hearing the word ""shoes"". I thought to myself, ""Shoes? What does this have to do with Christmas?"" Then I started to really listen to the words and music. For the last 20 miles of my trip, I was in uncontrollable tears."
1,"Only 1 star because there's no option for a minus 10,000,000","Note to self: Add ""heave"" to to-do list.One of the other reviewers pontificated that those who do not like this song ""must not be Christian"".Dead annoying, that.I'm Christian...a devout, practicing one, and I detest this song. Being a Christian does not negate the ability to recognize a cheesy plebian hack job when I see it.What does being a Christian have to do with it? What a close-minded, judgmental, condescending thing to say.This song, IMO, is simply a poorly written, poorly executed attempt to pull at heartstrings. If the author's Very Cunning Plan had succeeded, great. But this one fails miserably. Phrases like ""you see, sir..."" would probably have most of the Saints in heaven rolling their eyes and reaching for the Mylanta.It's like a lot of Christian Rock. The message might be positive, but a badly written song is a bad song, regardless of its message.Nothing will make this turkey fly."
5,works,"we have 3 of these now, seems like when they work they work great. the product is great. no problems."
3,Another gift,"I like Tim's style, so I got this album for my father for Father's Day. He finally started listening to it in his truck while running errands, and says he enjoys it enough to listen to it every day."
1,money wasted,"DVD Confidential: Hundreds of Hidden Easter Eggs RevealedNot nearly as comprehensive as I had hoped, repeats much, if not all, of the first volume. Save your $"
3,"Adventure, Mystery, and Ships","I did enjoy this book, but it was nothing special. I liked the main character, Adam's, determination and strong character. I, also, liked the twists and turns. The characters were stereotypical: the evil banker, greedy uncle, and determined hero, Adam. I found myself becoming bored with the story and never grew attached to any of the characters. The one character that interested me, Jade, whose mystery and strength I found alluring, was actually rather nave and weak. The ending was left open to a sequel, which can be considered a good or bad thing. All in all this was an average novel."
3,Average,The book is a fair read with a good basic overview of Napoleon's campaigns. What stops it becoming very good is Horne's insistance of always comparing Napoleon to Hitler. In the eara of dictators a comparison of say Stalin to Hitler is fair. However Napoleon should be compared to his then enemies ... all kings & emperors. The evil of Hitler / Stalin should hold a special infamous place in history.
3,How far from Austerlitz: a victory in prose,"If you want an entertaining experience of Napoleon, then read Alastair Horne's book. Informative and intruiging, it covers military, psychological, and personal matters of Napoleon and France smoothly, and normally in just the right amount of detail. Special attention is paid to the battle of Austerlitz itself. This, it must be said, is odd, considering that the issue the book pursues is essentially the corrupting influence of power, not a comparison of troop deployment between Austerlitz and, say, Borodino. The book has a momentum, a force of its own in which I was carried along, arresting only at Napoleon's second journey into exile. Thus the book was certainly never tedious, and was indeed exciting. Thus I believe the slight loosening of Horne's hold on the matter of inter-state and internal power relationships is made up for by his literary skill."
4,St. Helena is a Long Way from Austerlitz,"""How Far from Austerlitz?"" is almost exactly what I was looking for: a brief, highly readable account of the Napoleonic Wars (about which I know relatively little). Horne explains why Austerlitz was Napoleon's most brilliant battle, carried out when he and his soldiers were at their peak. Using that battle as its frame of reference, the book describes the rise and fall of Napoleon and the Grand Army.My only complaint is that ""How Far from Austerlitz?"" looks at this fascinating period almost exclusively from the perspective of Napoleon and other major players. While that's fine as far as it goes, I would have preferred an ""Ambrose-style"" narrative that also told the story of the rank-and-file Napoleonic soldier."
1,"Flimsy, Different from Picture, Missing Parts","The picture for this item shows nylon sleeved semi-transparent connectors. The connectors that arrived are a cheaper hard plastic that breaks easily. The case is a thin brittle clear plastic that feels like it will break after opening and closing it just a few times.I ordered this set mainly for the quick-disconnects, but I can't even use them because this set comes with only female connectors. The male connectors are not included, so they are basically worthless.Probably not worth the postage to return these, very disappointing. Avoid ordering this set and look for something better."
1,Got fooled !,"What do you think of when you see the picture of this item? Flexible, semi-transparent insulation, right? That's not what you're gonna get! Amazon should change the picture of this item because I've been fooled like the other reviewers. If I wanted some cheapo hard plastic insulation connectors like these I could just easily go get them anywhere for about the same price!@! Im stuck with it because it's gonna cost just as much to send it back."
2,review for others,"kit came in good condition, but i was dissapointed when it didnt have all the terminals shown in the picture. doesnt come with the female connector as shown, doesnt list in description if it had it or not, only lists the gage of size"
3,Not the same as pictured item,"Picture clearly shows the 'higher end' terminal types - i.e. the better quality colored parts (nylon vs. vinyl I believe) - whereas these are the 'lower end' type terminals, which unless you have a good-quality crimper (luckily I do) you will run into problems with poorly insulated end results (your cheap crimper will break through the insulation).Other than that, they are a good price and, as I mentioned before I have a good quality crimper, but did end up going out and buying the higher-end type locally so I could complete the job I was working on."
1,"excellent idea, poor quality","I will say that the idea of this was cool! However, if you're looking for a quality brush and you like your hair to lay down or wave up this IS NOT the brush for you.The firm side is like trying to brush your hair with those steel street sweep brushes. The bristles are way too close together allowing the brush to collect dandruff dry skin and hair way too easily. If you have waves you know exactly what i mean. Without any exaggeration this brush could be used to clean grime off of tiles and grout. The soft side is way too soft. it's absolutely useless even for facial hair. It may be too soft for a infants head.PROS:conceptno handleCons:Firm side is extremely rough (feels like it's drawing blood)!soft side is terribly soft, uselessbristles are too close, allows a build up of hair, grease, dirt, etc..."
2,"Cheap, works ok","With hair shaved close to the head, the soft side of this works fine - although the bristles fall out pretty easily. The rough side, as reviewed here, would make this better for cleaning bathroom fixtures. Since this is a three pack, that idea works out pretty well. I would get a more durable piece, if they weren't so expensive."
2,OK.,"I'll keep this short. There is no denying things like this do happen. However, the director/writer has reduced it to an extremely one-sided argument, stripping the predicament of its complications. There are several documentaries out on this subject, that give a much more impartial view on it. Check out some of those if you want a full-fledged discussion on homosexuality with modern faith. And at least then you don't have to sit through some of the painful acting and script writing."
2,Bad,"A closeted Mormon man falls in love with a very out gay man. The movie chronicles their relationship.Wow. This movie is LOUSY!The acting isn't too bad--both of the main actors are attractive but not once did I believe they were gay or in love with each other (both are straight in real life). They kiss all wrong and the one sex scene is VERY brief.That aside, the writing is lousy. The dialogue was off (some of the lines were just unbelievable) and there are about 4 or 5 plot ""twists"" that would never happen in real life. Also Mormons come off very badly in this movie. They're portrayed as homophobic jerks and very evil too. Add in a pointless role for Jacqueline Bissett and a totally unbelievable happy ending and you've got one BAD movie!Want to see a good gay movie about relationships? See ""Jeffrey"" or ""Love! Valour! Compassion!"" Avoid this."
4,The little movie that could,"This movie starts out with a great plot, adequate acting, and an apparently low budget. But what comes out of it all is a warm, positive assessment that romance is alive and well--yes, even among the often shallow reality of typical gay nightlife. The sets look sitcom, but the chemistry is so good between the two leading guys (both hunks!) that you just really dont care. And in the end, what you thought would be a fluffy, naughty little flick turns into a full-blown serious love story. This is a hard movie not to like. I give up!"
5,"Wasn't expecting much, but was I surprised","After about 45 minutes I was thinking that everything was going to plan. The movie was good, but not great. Then other angles on the story came in and it got a lot more complicated. In the end it had me in tears. This movie works on so many levels, you can read things into the script in many ways. This is the first movie that moved me to write a comment about it here. This is one of the best gay love stories I've seen."
4,Balancing the Latter,"Latter Days starts off the bat with sex and I was thinking alright another run-of-the-mill gay movie. However, I was pleasently surprised to find humor, a plot and direction both for the film and the actors portraying the characters. Definately a movie that pitches religion and the alternative lifestyle in comparison and watches as characters fall to either side of the issue. Sandross and Ramsey don't overact their parts which makes for likable characters that you feel for, especially for Ramsey who steels many scenes with subtle quietness."
5,HOT GUYS - SWEET STORY,"This movie, GRANDE ECOLE and NEVERLAND (the gay-themed Peter Pan movie - not the Johnny Depp movie!) have the sexiest guys ever. I highly recommend these three movies if you are into extremely beautiful men and explicitly gay-themed independent movies. LATTER DAYS is a bit on the soap-operatic side, but the other two are much more sophisticated/stylish. These are my top three."
4,Funny and moving film,"Anticipating a light and amusing film, I was surprised at the depth of feeling it evoked. It conveyed a powerful message about homophobia and Mormonism. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,BEST LOVE STORY OF GAYS EVER,"THE STORY IS REAL AND IS THE BEST GAY LOVE STORY TO THIS DATE, SWEET, SAD, TWO HOT GUYS AND IN THE END FEELING GOOD FILM."
4,Exceptional Movie,"When I first heard of this movie I said to myself, "" OKay, the last thing I need is a movie about a whole bunch of Mormon's."" The movie ascends the level of parcticular mormon theology and dives deep into an underlying desire to just love! The movie was every slightly changing the mood. Built on comedy, romance, and a little twist- this is a perfect purchase. Please note that I rate this movie four stars, no movie will ever receive five stars from me because they could always be better. All in all the movie was wonderful- The music was phenomenal and the actors were not exactly ""new dramatic blood"". You know, the ones who over do it on the drama. I recommend this movie to all, homosexual and heterosexual alike."
4,Missionary Man,"Am I the only person who thinks ""Latter Days"" would make a great musical? Imagine, if you will, a big splashy Broadway musical set to the music of the Eurythmics.Mr Cox, are you listening?"
4,Finally! A gay movie with a happy ending.,"This was reccomended on my friend's list on Livejournal and I was a bit dubious about renting it, but finally did.Despite the predictable dialogue, it was definitely one of the best gay-themed films I've ever seen. While I could see one plot point coming a mile away, there were things that delightfully surprised me and the end is priceless.A very fine feel-good movie. But, I'd really like to know if Mormon boys are that stupid."
5,The Best,"If you believe in the strength of love and God's role in love, then this is the movie to see! It will touch your heart as both of the main characters struggle to discover the depths of love, while dealing with the surreal realites of the superficial that can so envelope you and hide you from tasting and seeing true love. Go and see this movie it is incredible!"
4,A loverly love story.,"Latter days reminds me or those small movies that leave a BIG impression.I'm not going to tell you the plot beacuse other revewers have done that already ;-)The film is a truly loverly love story, both the lead characters play there roles butifuly, and make there characters completly belevable, you'd never know that they had never done a movie before.The sound track is great and mathes the mood and feeling of the film well.All the actors do well and together draw you into Aaron and christians world. The story is sweet but has its moment of hard hitting drama, its not TOO safe and keeps you thinking and asking questions till its end.This DVD has some great extras aswell, including a commentary by the director and the two lead actors which is very funny and informative, also music videos and a short movie called Reason Thirteen which made me laugh out loud!On the whole a good buy and worth a watch!"
3,"Good, but not great","There's much to like in this film and a fair bit not to like. My main complaint is the lack of screen time to show the development of romantic love between the leading men, each of whom is from a very different background. A great film could have been made about their overcoming various obstacles AFTER establishing a strong love interest, or an interesting film made about getting their relationship off the ground. All of the characters needed more development to make their transformations more plausible. Unfortunately, much of the film felt contrived."
5,The essence of love,"This movie is heart warming, faith in love strengthening and definitely belongs in the category with hits like ""While you were sleeping"" and other inspirational feel good movies. This one will make you think and you gotta get over the initial 20 minutes which are just a little too colorful, but after that the story gets deep and touching. BEAUTIFUL MOVIE :)"
5,It mattered to me,"I have seen ""Latter Days"" six times and I think I may have become addicted to it. Although I have read reviews that claim the characters are stock and predictable, I was able to identify with them and felt as if they were sharing my own thoughts and feelings and fears. I think this movie is powerful for those of us struggling to find our authentic selves and those struggling to find meaningful relationships."
2,"I don't get what people see in this movie, but many love it","Wes Ramsey's character was a huge turn off for me. I didn't like anything about him. He was as unlikeable as the lead was genuinely likable. The movie is predictable, but many, many people have connected to this movie, cried, and fallen in love with the story. The movie had potential, but not enough potential for me to give Latter Days anything more than two stars."
2,Do NOT Buy This!!!!,"I am absolutly stunned by how many people think that this movie is worth buying. I rented this movie when I first saw it and I wanted my $4 back. The acting as well as the writting is terrible! I could not believe how not only bad it was, but unrealistic as well.I sincerely reccomend that if you absolutly have to see this movie, rent it. The characters are just beyond unbelievable. There is also a strange sub-plot with the woman that apparently all the ""friends"" work for that never really means anything to the story. To think that this B movie is one of the greatest gay, bi, straight movie ever is to think that Gili is as well."
5,Latter Days,"This is an outstanding movie which covers opposite ends of the spectrum of being gay. Most gay men can respond to the emotions of being gay and what some church organizations are capable of in judging gay men. The other man in this movie is openly gay and really, ""Out."" I highly recommend this movie. It turns into a beautiful love story. (I am thankful that my church and my Jesus accept me for who I am, a gay man.)"
3,a bit forced,"I found the acting a bit forced, even from the supposed ""big names"" in the movie. The story is not always believable. I do recommend it be watched but not as a gripping heart moving stuff, but light entertainment.Richard"
3,Great moments.,"I am still unsure why I am ready to forgive so many of the limitations of Latter Days. While the film has not fully realised the potential of the subject matter, I found it still had an extraordinary emotional impact. It has some very powerful scenes such as Aaron's being disgraced in the eyes of his peers, Christian's very brief meeting with Aaron's mother, and the scene [which I won't give away] set the morning after a love scene [which incidentally, was all the more intimate for all the talking rather than the sex.]It's a bit formulaic, [boy meets boy, boy loses boy etc., etc.,] and other reviewers seem to be struggling with plausibility issues. A severe re-editing could make this into a tight and powerful film but as it is, there's still a lot to like in this engaging and moving romance. I also very much enjoyed Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance in a minor role."
2,Predictable and Sappy Gay Soap With Not A Drop of Originality,"As a 51 year-old gay man who is not in the closet and is happy with a 20+ year LTR, I feel I know a thing about real life in gay circles. I have also had 3 other LTRs, 2 of my partners passed away after 6 years each of monogamous partnership and my first left me for a drag queen and promptly died from AIDS in 1985. This movie does not do a good service to young gay men EXCEPT to give them hope. Some viewers may find love but the vast majority will not, at least not in any way this fantasy plays out. It is a contrived, by-the-gay-numbers movie with a plot that I had written out in my head after 10 minutes into it. It rings hollow and is cheap looking. The acting is OK in my opinion. Still stinks. Now, if you approach this fairy tale with the mindset that it is your boring typical boy-meets-boy story soap opera and is not as a documentary or as holding anything resembling true life, you will be fine."
5,A Different Slant,"I was immediately taken by this film, so much so that I watched it again within a few days as it starkly shows the contrasts of the out, proud gay guy living in his gay world, with the closeted gay who both fears being gay, and knows his family and church are totally opposed. It shows the hard road coming to terms is for so many of us, yet keeps you wanting more, and of course finally - has a happy ending. Steve Sandvoss is outstanding as the Mormom Elder and Wes Ramsey plays the big city gay guy to the hilt."
5,"In a world where too few exist, this one hits it out of the park.","Without giving away the story, I will say that I decided not to see Latter Days when it was playing at the theatre because I assumed it was yet another gay film that ended in tragedy. However, to my surprise the film has a wonderful and uplifting ending. In a world where too few exist, Latter Days paints a realistic portrait that combines a number of gay related issues, from coming out -to a coming of age. Of course, it also deals with an otherwise charitable Mormon family that falls to pieces when they learn that their clean-cut, boy-next-door son is a homosexual."
2,Expected Much More (no puns...),"No, I'm not gay, I just like gay movies, go figure.This film started out well. A Mormon from Idaho is sent on a mission with 3 other boys to Los Angeles, where the protagonist, Christian, ends up falling for a gay waiter who is seeking to conqueor Christian based on a bet.Nice premise, and it is fairly entertaining, but ultimatly falls flat. I don't mind bashing religions, I do it all the time, but it was done here in a very unconvincing way. I felt that the queers, one of whom is ""shallow,"" but ""not really,"" in this film were even worse than the ""right-winged, narrow minded"" Mormons. There is so much stereo-typing in this, that I ended up laughing at dialouge that wasn't meant to be laughed at. And the ending! Oh, please...it would've been an ok film were it not for the predictable, sappy ending.This is sure to have its appeal with some, but those of you looking for a Almodovar-ish intellectual masterpiece; I doubt you'll find it here."
2,A REDO review,"I stopped watching this movie and gave it one star earlier this year, after a particularly sad scene, because I couldn't take what I thought was another sad sad movie ending. But then thanks goodness I watched it again, and I love it, especially the happy hopeful ending.Sorry fans, but this movie lover can't take another sad hopeless gay movie, even if the ending is the real deal.I love this movie and I highly recommend buying it. I have watched it more than 10+ times and I love it more with each viewing."
3,You may be dissapointed.,"The love scene's felt more like eye candy than a portrayal of love. It felt like it had an agenda, anti-mormonism. It did do a good job of pointing out some hypocirsies and supposed (probable?) abuses torward gay family and church members. With it's Religious, Sociological and somehwhat spiritual context. Humanism seems to be what breaks through ultimately. This movie dispell's no myths and shed's no light on many stereotypes it makes generous use of. It can feel like a paint by numbers movie. Yet it many ways works with the help of some very poignant and well acted scenes. It's definately not for cynics. Real heart and emotion does come through. Though this may largely depend on your own connections with the subject matter."
5,Awesome Gay Flick,"To, me the best gay film and my favorite movie - gay or straight. You won't be disaapointed, but it shows the Mormon church for what it really is!!!"
5,BEST MOVIE I'VE WATCHED!,"I'm a 20-year old guy leaving in L.A. and I had never been interested on watching gay-related films, but now that I've seen Latter Days, I can't believe what I missed when it came out on the big screen. For anyone who has a true heart, this movie will really touch it. I just want to cry everytime I watch it because it shows that gays can also have a relationship with true love. I liked the way the movie go, first they met and Aaron showed Christian that life insn't all about sex, fun, and being shallow; that it should be about believing that one can become something else no matter what. Then later at the right moment came the kiss and finally almost at the end they got together, it was amazing! The movie is based on a true story and it does show. I still don't know for how long I'll keep watching it because everytime I do it leaves butterflies in my stomach, can't help it!"
3,Redeeming moments,"An enjoyable movie experience, and they characters aren't high the whole time or shoot each other at the end--fairly novel for a lot of gay movies I have seen lately. Although there are many cliché and predictable scenes (thus the three stars), there are also many original, funny, innocent, cute, happy, very sexy scenes. I would rent this one before buying. For me watching once or twice was enough, but it should be watched. Get it when you are in the mood for a fun movie that has a couple of heavier moments, but overall will leave you with a smile on your face and wanting to go out on a really great date."
4,Latter Days rewardlingly romantic,"Morman missionary Aaron meets West Hollywood party boy Christian and opposites attract. However, Christian's questionable motivation rocks Aarons world when he finds out he may have been had. More than just a coming of age gay movie, this film explores the dilema between faith and romance. It quietly looks at the stereotypes and prejudice faced both internally and externally and delivers some needed social punch. The actors are handsome and visually appealing, but this movie is deeper than it's surface skin might show. It shows how casually people enter into commitments only to find out that the process is far from ""casual"" in it's impact. Realizing that ""you can't take it back"" is a hard learned lesson, as these characters find out. There is an intensity to this movie that should broaden it's appeal. The even pacing and flow of this movie coupled with good acting (including some sceen stealing by some of the supporting actors) make it well worth watching."
3,"Oh, please, another old fart needing an audience","As usual, to those desperate for attention, and have ""favors-owed"" (it seems) by an editor from the past, Lee rants on and on like ""grandpa/grumpa"" would. With the exception of his ""9 C's of Leadership,"" and similar, I've heard similar rants all my life from my own Father---captive audience. Save your money, unless you've never been vaccinated by someone like this. Good points? Perhaps, but he could have put them in a memo? It's all but painfully clear to those without vested interests in the current Republican Leadership of the Republican Party nowadays how little GWB-43 has ""going for him."" He's an alcoholic!! Sheesh, must be the alcoholics & ""enablers"" that keeps supporting him. Sigh, wasted $18 bux. S."
1,I Wouldn't Buy This Book On A Dare,"I read a friends copy of this book and I was most dissapointed. It is nothing but Bush bashing. Okay Lee, you don't like Bush, so what does that have to do with leadership. This book is nothing but the rantings of an old out-of-touch liberal. Kind of like Al Gore will be when he's 80. If you want to learn something about leadership, read John Maxwell not Lee Imacookoo. What a waste of time this book is!!"
1,A boring Bush-Bash,"The first section of this book, some 124 bages, is a redundant, tiresome Bush-Bash. He could have stated his opinion in a page! Why beat this dead horse?"

5,Publisher Please Allow Viewers To Look Inside,"That's it. That look inside feature is the best thing since sliced bread ... therefore ... wise publishers should use it, use it, use it."
3,Needs updating.,"I have always respected Iacocca but some of the premises put forward in his book have not played out over time. Also, his politics is very one sided and slanted to the democrat side of the equation. It could have been more balanced. Otherwise, his leadership principles that were not political were excellent."
5,Iacocca tells it like it is,"A must read book for our times. Hard hitting questions that we all should be asking of our so called elected officals. As our country stumbles off balance from one crisis to another due to lack of leadeship, many of us are asking ""what's going on in Washington DC""? What happened to ""Goverment by the people, for the people"" seems to the question of the day. The answers are here."
5,The State of the U.S.A.,This commentary on what some say is an apparent lack of leadership in America today will make you applaud.
5,An Eye Opener,"This is a must read for anyone who is interested in what is and isn't going on behind the scenes in Government and Big Business. I usually take a month to read a small book like this (I'm very relaxed), but Lee Iacocca's way of putting things in writing had me going and I finished in a couple of days (some kind of record for me).Where Have All the Leaders Gone?"
2,Disappointing,"Loved his first book. In light of that, I overlooked his overt brutality of the Bush Administration until I realized that this was, for the most part, the focus of the book. Perhaps deservedly so, but the extent of his criticisms made his message unconstructive and more like a personal rant.Lee Iacocca made his name by being a straight-shooter and a man of ideas. This work showed him as neither and for that, I'm really disappointed."
4,Where Have All the Leaders Gone?,"""Where Have All the Leaders Gone?"" does an excellent job of asking the questions of how United States leadership has failed us, especially in the last decade or so. As a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) himself, Lee Iacocca explains the limitations and responsibilities of such a role. He offers insights that we, the voters, should be demanding of our leaders."
4,More appropriate question for today than ever before.,"Love that Iacocca simply tells it the way he sees it. Don't agree with all he says(who would?) but this book is a keeper. Any leader (or aspiring leader) can learn a great deal from reading this book.Ron Miriello, Sanford, NC"
5,straight talk with backed up facts,"Lee presents a critical analysis of today's presidential candidates(except for Thompson, who had not declared yet) and offers sound fair criticism of each based on a set of criteria he developed to critique any leader. Some books are better with photos. This book has none and benefits from not having any. Iacocca is a straight shooter and I like the areas where he admits his own shortcomings."
1,Disappointing Rants from a previously respected spokesperson.,"I always thought highly of Iacocca as a no-nonsense guy, but this book is a dated DNC talking points Bush-bashing which in today's mess should be comical but instead is sad. I would love to hear what he thinks of the new administration he wanted and got and their current leadership ability. Changing parties is obviously NOT the solution.If you want to relive the old let's hate Bush & Cheney and the War is a lie, then this is for you. Otherwise expecting anything approaching wisdom in this effort is a waste of time. Very disappointing."
4,"Insightful, but...","Very thought-provoking book... for a while. Mr. Iacocca provides very insightful commentary on leadership in general, our current (USA) administration, and the hopefuls for the next election.However, that is almost undone by two negatives:1. He goes on a long, rambling rant about the auto industry. The cornerstone of capitalism? The glue of democracy? Uh... no. Expand your horizons, Mr. Iacocca. The world existed before the auto industry, and it will exist long after. Deal with it. This was a very distracting tangent.2. Name-dropping. In a book on political leadership, *some* name-dropping is inevitable. Mr. Iacocca gets a bit carried away with it. I really don't care that you spoke to so-and-so while vacationing at your Tuscan villa -- just get to the point!All-in-all, very good book -- if you can get past these two things."
2,The Hand That Feeds,"Anyone familiar with Iacocca will find no surprises in this book.Of course he's biased.That's how this ""great leader"" saved his company.Remember, he was able to borrow money at interest rates FAR below the rates Ford & GM could borrow.THAT'S what made the Chrysler's comeback possible. Iacocca didn't have to compete.All He had to do was put his hand out & beg."
3,Where Have All the Leaders Gone?,"This is not one of Lee Iococca's better books. He is too critical of many of our leaders,even though some of them could shape up."
4,"Lee Iacocca, Where have all the leaders gone?","Good read. I like how Lee is a straight shooter, he calls it like he sees it. His views on the business world, politics and people are spot on. It is good for a laugh every few paragraphs.I found his diolog with Fidel Castro entertaining to say the least."
2,Sad,"Lee lost me when he mentioned Character and Clinton in same paragraph. It is a shame and sad that he spent so much time in the Bush bashing and not coming up with real ways to fix a lot of problems. Most of his leadership ideas could be found anywhere business is discussed. Getting new business leaders to follow the time tested ideas is the problem. All who think Lee saved Chrysler have not talked to those thousands that were put out of work. Like so many like him, it is easy to Monday morning quarterback, Branson of Virgin Atlantic is now a champion of the environment, would have liked to seen someone tell him 20 years ago his jets were causing global warming. Or tell Lee he could not do anything he wished to cut cost..."
5,Passionate...but will fall on deaf ears,"I am more than half way through with this book and I love it. Not so much as opinions (as some have posted) but advice based on facts and experience. He calls out the cowards plain as day (those in the White House and those that sit on their laurels).If you would read the dust jacket you would discover it's not a business book.Well worth reading but too bad most of America is ruled by fear and will not address anything Mr. Iacocca wrote.It's funny how Conservatives get the ""Holocaust deniers/creationist"" attitude when the truth comes out.It's nice to see that someone his age is not as fearful as the rest of the voting senior citizens of this country."
5,Page turner,I LOVED tis book and wished that Iacocca had run for president. It was truly a page turner for me.
3,Good reading but somewhat dated,"The first few chapters were a focused attack on George Bush. Once the book got into Iacocca's personal thoughts and history, it was hard to put it down"
2,Not quite enough leadership,"I was eagerly looking forward to Iacocca's book, having read his biography many years back. I wanted to see what he would say in hindsight as he looked back. Although he says a lot, probably not as 'deep' as I would have liked. A great man looks back and says ""This was good"" or ""Made a mistake here"", or ""we could expand on this"". I was disappointed to find his book more a justification of himself, and maybe even vitriolic. Although I like and respect leaders who stand up to be counted, Iacocca has his numbers wrong. Insightful book on how not to lead!"
1,One rich man's tantrum,"Pardon me. I saw the title of this book, and picked it up to take home thinking it was a book on leadership. This is a topic in which I am very interested. I was wrong. This is one rich man's diatribe against the Bush administration. The title is a complete misnomer for what is in the book. Save your tantrums for your party guests, Lee. Don't try to sell them to the public under misleading titles.I took it back."
1,Shere Have All the Leaders Gone?,I read the first chapters in this book and thought I was reading the New York Times. I can get this liberal - blame America first drivel from the print media and the news networks. Why buy the book.This was the first book that I have ever owned that I wanted to burn!Such a waste for Mr Iacocca!
1,Not up to par,"This book could have been interesting, and some of Iacocca's suggestions and ideas are intriguing. The problem, however, is that he cannot get past his partisanship. The first chapter, for instance, details his ideal leadership qualities and why Bush does not live up to them. Unfortunately, he does not support his claims with a factual analysis, but, rather, unsupported opinion--even if many of his claims could be supported, he leaves them as stand-alone ""facts,"" which hurts his intentions. He claims that all Americans should--indeed, must, if they call themselves patriots--be outraged at the current government, yet he fails to support that opinion. He simply accepts opinion and conjecture as fact and moves on from there. Don't get me wrong; I do think that some of his ideas are quite worthwhile. But his political bias interferes with his attempts at providing a straightforward, rational analysis of leadership."
2,Still Looking for Leadership,"Lee was a great car guy, but he makes a poor political hack. While decrying the polarization in our country caused by the politics of hate, he takes up most of the book bashing Busch. Apparently everything that is wrong in the Universe was a plot carried out by the Evil President Busch. If this absuridty were true, Iaccoa would have negated the rational for the book, since that would make Busch the greatest ""Leader"" of all time. Lee should stick to cars."
1,"O.K., we get it. You hate Bush. But, what about leadership???","This book isn't about leadership - it's a collection of hateful rants aimed at the Bush presidency. Touting the ""success"" of the Chrysler K car (!?!?!) was laughable and delivering a mean-spirited attack about the president's actions on 9/11 was churlish and really low. I'm glad my president had the good sense NOT to look panicked to the world (kids at school) and to assess his safety before heading back to D.C. This book masquerades as a book about leadership, but it is really an octogenarian's platform for spewing his political dogma and venom."
1,Where has Iacocca's brain gone?,"This book is nothing but a divisive, hate-filled diatribe against President Bush. I bought it to get some insight into Mr Iacocca's views of leadership. Instead what I got is 263 pages of anti-Bush rhetoric that is the same ignorant material that is found on the infantile pages of the Daily Kos and other extreme liberal web pages. It is obvious that Mr Iacocca did not write this or, if he did, he is slipping ungracefully into senility."
1,Real Leaders Chased Off,"This book was a real disappointment. Mr Iacocca demonstrated a complete lack of objectivity. His main thrust was to bash Bush while extolling the virtues of Clinton and Gore and any other that will take a far left wing stance. A criticism of a president is ok but we do not live in a world where all of one group are right and all of the other are wrong. Where Have All The Leaders Gone? has nothing to do with seeking real leaders but instituting an ideology. Sorry, this book has little redeeming value."
1,How Sad!,"I wasn't even through the first chapter and I realized that a once great American Business Leader has turned into a crotchety, whiny geezer. Iacocca's Autobiography was an excellent read and I was hoping for something along that line, but what we have here an old man, reminiscent of the old men sitting around the pot belly stove in the General Store solving the worlds problems by plowing fields in the other direction. Mr. Iacocca doesn't have a clue about the worlds problems and prefers to be at the center of attention at the latest snob party. Bashing Bush is about as original as DIRT, so stick to your Brandy and Cigars old man. As a side note, your POS K-car is no where to be seen today. That's because most of them broke down at 20,000 miles."
1,Where Have All the Leaders Gone?,"Where have all the leaders in America gone? To bookstores where they have purchased Iacoocca's book and now they are all trying to do ten things that start with C: In the rest of the world, leaders are playing with a full alphabet. Who moved Iacocca's cheese? Once a CEO and now a Michael Moore wannabe. Reading this is a waste of time."
4,Not Bad Lee,"It is always good to read and hear what our elders have to say. Lee Iacocca will go down in history as very good leader. Lee did contradict himself a few times in the book saying we need to have an open economy then saying the government needs to help the US auto makers.I agree with his point about ""fair"" trade between the US, Japan and China.This book should be read by all business leaders. I finished this book today while on an airplane and will be passing it on to my boss. The book was given to me by my 26 year old son. Tells me we DO have some future leaders in our ranks. But sadly most of them DO NOT go into public office."
5,Thought provoking and timely!,Lee Iacocca presents bold real-time thought provoking questions. A must read for Americans prior to voting in the next election. Ponder the questions posed by Mr. Iacocca and take action!Every reader can relate to the story lines. It's an easy read - hard to put down once one begins reading it. Bravo!!
5,Finally a straight shooter!,"Lee Iacocca gives his opinion in a clear and concise manner based upon his extensive experience as a leader. He does so with no sugar-coating or political correctness -- very refreshing! However, I'm sure that the current presidential administration and all of his loyalists do not fully appreciate the author's blunt approach and accurate assessment of their performance. Our country has some serious, deep-seated problems that the President and members of Congress are totally ignoring. It's time for other leaders to step up to the plate to help our country regain its competitiveness, to help the middle class, and to restore our outstanding reputation around the world. This is an excellent book and Lee has written what many of us have been discussing among our small groups for years! Well worth the price and time to read. Share it with a friend when you're done and then begin to take action yourself..."
3,His question is a good one but his biases weaken the book,"Everyone agrees that our country suffers from a lack of leadership. Iacocca does a good job of framing the issues but he loses credibility by allowing his obvious political biases to be so one sided. Almost all of his bad examples refer to Republicans and his cited ""heroes"" are Democrats such as john Kerry or John Murtha. The truth is that all the rascals, Democrat and Republican, are the same today. Iacocca's book would have been more compelling if he had been an ""equal opportunity"" accuser. The whole American political scene reeks of self-interest with every side pointing out the hypocrisy of the other to cover up their own. There are no leaders in American government or large corporate America. About that Lee is right."
4,Lee Lets Loose,"Lee Iacocca is an American institution. The son of Italian immigrants, he worked his way up to be one of the most influential auto executives in the country. In a ""no holds barred"" delivery he laces into President George W. Bush (a man who he originally supported!) and brings him to task for the situation in Iraq, and how hopeless it has become. He also questions America's spiraling down the economic ladder and how vastly overpaid today's CEO's are...especially for poor results! He not only offers criticism, but good common sense solutions on how we can & should turn America around. A great read for sure!"
2,Surprisingly disappointed,"For someone who has been in business for as long as Mr. Iacocca has, he should understand more about what makes the world go around, and deal with the realities. This book is long on whining and short on real solutions. The problem is corruption - corruption from the individual level to the society at large - and no one has a real solution for it. When a fix for short term thinking and greed comes, then all of the other political and economic problems will be solved.I am surprised that Mr. Iacocca takes no responsibility for the policies that he helped to promulgate (NAFTA), which we are now seeing the fruit of. George Bush is not God, and isn't the sole bearer of responsibility for 50 years of liberal ideology in America. There is plenty of blame to go around in all American political and business circles. If the reader wants good ideas for the short term, look elsewhere than this book."
5,Highly recommended!,"I purchased this item over five and a half years ago, and it works just as well now as it did when I first received it. If you do a lot of coring, then I recommend this item. It is lightweight but sturdy and goes through the dishwasher just fine. Aesthetically, it complements the rest of my blue KitchenAid items."
1,Very disappointing,"I lost myself in the world of the first two books--this one was simply jarring! To disjointed, to many characters with names to difficult to keep track off, and to many unanswered questions to be anywhere near satisfying as a ""conclusion"". I was never able to re-enter the world and simply enjoy the story! Constantly having to look-up names in the glossary was so much helpful as distracting.Unless there's more to come, what was the point of the No-God? the bird, etc. While so many other authors of epic fanatsy simply keep the story going ad-infinitum (gouging their paying public?), I looked forward to a trilogy that actually was a trilogy, but this ""conclusion"" without a conclusion was just as frustrating and in many ways, more disappointing."
3,Disappointed?,"I found the final installment of the Prince of Nothing Series to be somewhat anticlimactic. Perhaps high expectations are to blame, but I found Bakker dwelling on the mundane more and the exciting parts less than he did in The Darkness that Comes Before or The Warrior Prophet.I definitely enjoyed the glossary at the back. Lots of great history of the Three Seas to be found. Perhaps Bakker's next task will be to relay the story of the First Apocalypse or the Curo-Inchiori war?I recommend the series even though the payoff I craved in the end just wasn't there. The Thousandfold Thought is definitely my least favorite of the three."
3,Exciting but Confusing,"Ok, I am in the middle of the book. While I like the story it very confusing with so many char. in the story. I am also in the part of the book where a char we think is dead is alive again so that does not help. What I need to the index as a seperate book as I spend 1/2 my time flipping back and forth. I really want to thank the author for finnishing the story in 3 books, see (WOT) OMG is that long and not done yet or several others that I am waiting for the last or next to the last book to come out."
2,"""this is the end, my only friend"" ...!","I guess mr. Bakker run out of ideas as soon as he finished writing the first book in the trilogy. Moreover when you reach the end of the book you have to realize that it ends in nothing... and that maybe all you read before is useless. Ok, I'm not saying that the book has no meaning (it is actually there, and it is quite disturbing...) but it simply couldn't satisfy anyone because at the end it seems you're back at the biginning which is quite annoying after well over 1500 pages of banal philosophy, sex and violence."
3,Intriguing but disappointing,"Well -- it kept me reading that's for sure. But the bottom line - too much introspection. Way too much introspection and not enough pace. Why spend so much time building up characters, so many words to give us deep insight into characters only to let us down when thought becomes action? Sure the literary flow follows the backbreaking philosophical musings -- maybe the author just needed to vent his PhD in Philosophy -- but the entire series is leading us to the meeting of Kellhus and his father who we all think will be ridiculously powerful -- and where's the fight? Sorry, folks. Don't bother beginning this series."
3,Some of this series is so engrossing and some is so vapid,"I LOVE the way Bakker does sorcery; it's the way it would really work in my mind if such a thing existed. Some of the personalities in the story are so continually conflicted and weepy that I begin to roll my eyes and think, ""oh, just man up already!"" The ending was incredibly weak in my opinion and I was left thinking, ""uh .... what? ... That's it??"" and am glad to see there is another book out to at least give this story the ending it deserves. Some of the character resolutions (C'naiur for example) leave me nonplussed and in regard to Kellhus I have a tough time buying the idea that so many people are falling for so clearly a self-serving personality who offers little in the way of substance but oh-so much in the way of lofty rhetoric and promises. Well, until this past November here in the US so I had to bump the book up another star considering this does indeed happen in real life."
4,One of the best,"But having said that, it does have some problems. For one, it does not wrap the story up as promised. Which is ok but I thought I was finally avoiding a 6 novel fantasy story here for once. When Cnaiur gets revenge it is a bit anti-climatic in my opinion. The battle is great and huge and, damn it was long. Some of it is confusing as well (like the thousandfold thought and what is it)(and Kelhus' conversation with his dad) and he oft is redundant in expressing a charaters feelings about certian topics.Scott Bakker as still made the most original fantasy story I have ever read. For that it gets my positive review. Keep up the good, no great, work."
2,Disappointing Non-Conclusion to the Series,"The Prince of Nothing series started out well, there were great possibilities to be explored: an ancient evil, a lurking tribe of guardians, and an unwitting world. The Warrior Prophet, gave me no real conclusion, the series seemed to only chronicle the rise of the Kellhus (obligatory savior with a machiavellian bent, and his ascendancy to power. No great war with the No-God (ancient evil), just a bit of political subterfug, a little bit of scheming, and a war among men.I found myself doing the equivalent of ""fast-forwarding"" through a dvd and flipping pages. It wasn't the philosophical subject matter that made me do this, it was the sheer volume of prose in this book, that made me lose further interest. Yes, I read it to finish the series, if you start the series you may as well finish with this book. Otherwise, not worth it."
2,"If you ever forget how much everyone reveres Kellhus, don't worry, Bakker will remind you on the next page","Imagine you're reading the Lord of the Rings. You get to the battle of Pellenor Fields, you see a Ringwraith killed and a huge army of Sauron's minions destroyed. Then imagine that instead of finishing the book, doing things like, you know, DESTROYING SAURON, Tolkien just held a coronation for Aragorn and ended it at that, with the fate of Middle-Earth still up for grabs. That would be this book.This trilogy could have been done in 1 1/2 - 2 volumes. Which would have been great, because it would have left room for the story to actually have an ending. But instead we have three bloated texts full of revelations and re-revelations of Kellhus' awesomeness, accompanied by descriptions of battles that somehow end up being dry and utterly boring. I'm giving two stars because Bakker has quite a way with word, but he has to learn when to stop using them and start advancing his plot."
4,Food for thought,"Well, to start Mr. Bakker is in my opinion one of the 3 top authors of fantasy to date. He shares company with George R.R. Martin and Steve Erikson. I thought this book to be the weakest of the series so far. Dont get me wrong, it is still better than most of the books on your library's shelves. There were a few places though that I had to struggle through. When I read a story I expect it to flow. Several portions of this book involving Esmi were just good for trying my patience. So I give this book 4 stars:)"
3,"Okay, now what?","Okay, okay, okay. I get it! Mr. Bakker is smarter than I am in the very sensible existential philosophy. That I get. What I also get is that Mr. Bakker completely understands the obsession with sex that most of us have. What I don't get is this: now what? Okay, so Kelhus has taken over the free world on the strenght of his ability to manipulate everyone around him. What about the Sranc? What about the No-God and the Consult? Why are they even in the book if they aren't going to be in the book? Aarg!"
4,slightly dissapointing,"Book Three in the Prince of Nothing trilogy is a step back from The Warrior Prophet. I think that the world Bakker has created is my favourite fantasy world (excepting Middle-earth of course!), but I think that in this book Bakker let's the plot get away from him a little bit. The end of the Holy War and Kellhus's confrontation with his father were both somewhat anticlimactic. Also I found the writing to be unclear at times. There were a couple of scenes in the book where I was not exactly sure what had happened even after rereading. However there was lot of interesting back-story delivered, much of it in a lengthy appendix, that gives juicy tidbits on the first apocalypse, the consult, the non-men and the No-god.To sum-up I was a little disappointed in this volume but only because I have such high hopes for the series."
4,Concise introduction to cancer biology,This book is really helpful for understanding the basic molecular and biological principles of neoplasia. It is a good start for those not familiarized with cancer (both students and researchers) since it covers a wide range of subjects from biology of tumor formation and spread to chemotherapy and epidemiology. Highly recommended
3,ok,the book is ok to study need to be updated but its worth studying and its helpful to have this book
1,Nothing scary,"So dissappointed in every single track. I was looking forward to 'better than TV' sound quality. Yes, that is about all you get. The arrangements are overblown and goofy, like a stereo cartoon soundtrack. If they had stayed with the orignal arrangements of all the themes this might have been a decent disc. Do not buy this expecting to play it on Halloween."
3,real war,"This is the incredible story of the decade of labour unrest(1912-1922) known as 'The Mine wars"". The author is not a great writer or stilist, but he witnessed much of the events in a variety of capacities (State Attorney General, among others) and he has the good sense to let the facts speak for themselves. This part of American history is as shocking as it is fascinating and richly deserves the attention Lee has given to it."
1,my opinion,I am an avid fan of West Virginia mining history as I have had many relatives in the industry and still do.I read this biased book by this biased author.He was intent on busting the union and defending the Baldwin Felts guards in whatever they did.The author was against the union and shows his bias all through the book.The most outrages part of the authors account is when he pats himself on the back throughout the book for his blatant bias against the UMWA and the poor coal miners.He even defends the outright murder of Sheriff Hatfield by the Baldwin Felts guards (thugs).
3,Looks used,I would not buy from them again. Either this was previously used or it was a floor model. Scratches all over the paint and metal. The packaging was like Fort Knox. Ridiculous.
1,What am I missing?,This particular Kindle edition appears to consist of little more than a table of contents and one poem. Where are the rest? What am I missing? Or is this edition really so incomplete?
1,Really bad,I don't see why this is even listed. This is very disappointing. I don't think we are missing anything because there is nothing there
1,Formatting failed,However they did the automatic formatting - it failed. See the other reviews - all of them are accurate. Not worth it for free.
2,Vocals lack the umph of the instruments,It is tragic that this band cannot decide on a lead singer through-out its tracks. It ends up in a cacophony of yelling and off pitch music. The only positive thing I have to say is that they have several melodies that if restructured in a nuturing musical environment could produce a top 40 hit. They should sell those off to a real band like the Mighty Mighty Boss tones and cut their losses.
1,Horrid,"Worst product of its type I have ever used. It's impossible to clean, has a short battery life, and cleans poorly. On bare floors the rotating brushes kick away as much debris as the weak vacuum picks up. Don't even bother with carpets. The thing that irks me the most, though--it makes me a moron for getting sucked in by another outrageous infomercial with its absurd claims."
1,the worst!,"I bought this item with high hopes. My daughter and I both have long hair, which of course leads to having to vacuum constantly. On top of that, we have a small home with a lot of traffic and a cat who sheds. Plus the cat litter that goes along with her, not to mention all of the everyday things that accumulate. This item worked maybe the first time I got it. I had to cut the hair out of the rollers several times during each use. I must have overworked the thing because within a few days it just sort of died. This was one of the worst sweepers/vacuums I have ever tried. I tried it on both my carpeted areas and vinyl kitchen floor. It didn't work very well on either. And I won't go on about the stairs ..."
2,"Good while it lasted, battery life is about 2 weeks.","I recently purchased this item from Amazon. Liked the product for the first week, but my battery wont keep a charge, I think my charger may be bad. The light doesn't even light up when it should be charging. Very disappointed with the whole thing. Wouldn't recommend it for this reason. If the battery wasn't an issue, then I would give this item a much higher rating. Good concept, poor execution!"
4,Dosn't work as well as the last one I bought,"This is my second swivel sweeper. I use it to sweep floors in my restaraunt and have really put it to the test. I love It, It is so easy to push and picks up dirt very well. The problem is the batteries don't last. The battery only lasts about 10-15 min. before you have to plug it in again. The first one I bought the battery lasted much longer, So either I got a dud or the product is inconsistent."
2,"This vacuum ""doesn't suck...""","I previously owned a Bissel Go Vac and loved it. Eventually, the battery wouldn't hold enough of a charge so I had to look for a new cordless for quick clean-ups. I bought this and unfortunately it didn't fit the ticket.Some good points: it is very lightweight, it moves very easily and gets close to edges. The battery holds a good charge and it doesn't need to stay plugged in so it can be stored anywhere.The bad points: It has absolutely no suction. The vacuum works by rotating brushes, NOT suction power. Therefore, it leaves a lot behind. It was poor on flat surfaces as it kicked up more that it picked up. Additionally, if you tilted the head by accident, it would spit out anything that it had vacuumed up.I would not recommend this product.I have since purchased an Electrolux Pronto with a built in mini-vac and I really like it.Needless to say, I've tried to sell my old Swivel at a really cheap price and no one is calling..."
4,Like original sweeper better than latter,I like this ORIGINAL sweeper because the dust bin is easier to clean and I don't need the elbow joint of the later model.
2,Easily Broken,I dropped mine and the frame immediately broke. The first one i had seemed to hold up much better.Wouldn't buy one again.
2,Swivel Sweeper,"I have used this sweeper, I am not happy since there are no wheels on the bottom of this product. It is not as smooth as the other Swivel Sweeper that I have purchased. The sweeper does not glide across the carpet as smoothly as my other sweeper. I would not recommend this for that reason.Thank you"
1,Good for a bald person,The first one I purchased lasted almost a year so I thought I would buy a replacement. The second one stopped working after the first use. The gears and shafts get easily bound up with hair and then the motor won't run. Would probably last if there wasn't a trace of hair on the floor but with two daughters and a wife with long hair this is a waste of money. I would recommend it only to a bald person.
5,Fantastic sweeper- bought my 4th one as gift,I am afraid I agree- I just don't get why people have trouble with the Swivel Sweeper- I have 4 of them now with friends over the last 6 months. Everyone loves them- they are not meant to be the end all vacuum but we have animals and they even pick up cat and dog hair easily. It is best to keep it fully charged but it still works after 30 minutes of use. I love it and highly recommend.
1,stops after few seconds,i wanted to try for myself so bought it but somewhat disappointed. i feel like i bought it for nothing. the battery was charged as per instruction. the sweeper works well but it is very annoying because it stops every few seconds. i have to turn it off and on after few minutes to make it work. ended up using the broom anyhow. sweeper ends up in the garage.
2,Yuck,"My Gran bought this for us, and I feel terrible that she wasted her money on it. What a piece of junk. Right out of the box, it missed a lot of stuff on the floor. It certainly isn't meant to replace a proper vacuum cleaner. We merely use it in the kitchen now, and even then, I generally have to pull out our upright vac if I want it totally clean. I cannot believe this thing retails for over forty bucks! Save your $$$ and get a lightweight vac for smaller jobs. It's about as good as a push vac."
3,So-So,I purchased this after watching the infomercial. At first it was great picking up from all sides and battery seemed to be lasting for a long time. I have all wooden floors in my house and it was nice and easy to use. All of a sudden the battery would not hold a charge and the handle began twisting and coming loose. It just doesnt seem to work as shown on the tv or as stated. I have had mine now 6 months and the last month has been not so good.
1,Don't waste your money,"At first it works great, but it doesn't hold much. Get's edges great but I got frustrated with it after about 1 month. Not good with high volume vaccuming... starts spitting things out and not great suction. Pain in the you-know-what to clean to make work well."
2,Worked at first but doesn't last,"I bought mine two years ago. It worked great at first but after a while one part or another would break, wear down, stop working after a year. I ordered another one and it lasted less than a year. Battery doesn't last either - after a while it wouldn't charge the sweeper at all. I have replaced the battery three times in two years. Parts are expensive to buy - a battery with s/h could cost almost as much as getting a new sweeper from the store. I bought another one last spring and now neither of my sweepers works - the old and the new one! True, it does not work on carpet - great on wood floors but it is not reliable & you'll be disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Cheap sweeper,"I was very disappointed in this sweeper. I actually got very lucky, because the day it came my sister in law was here and she told me that she has the same sweeper and she uses it for her tile floors. So she ran over and got it for me to try so I didn't have to open up my new one that I had just received. I tried hers and it worked o.k. on the vinyl floors but as soon as I tried to go on carpet runners or into my living room, it wanted to flip over. It wouldn't pick up anything on the carpet. If you are using it for just hardwood or vinyl floors , would be o.k. But definately no good for any kind of carpet, even if the carpet is low. I have a Shark sweeper #610 and love that sweeper compared to this one. The Shark goes on anything, even my living room carpet."
3,"not bad, but scratches floors","this is really great for what it is (not a vacuum, i.e. no suction), but great for in between cleaning. i like it especially for the hard floors (linolium), but it does leave scuffy marks on my floor, like drag marks, not exactly scratches (i hope), due to the plastic of the sweeper rubbing on the floor. it's not so great with carpet.-dianna"
2,Midiocre sweeper,"I liked it when I first used it. It maneuvers in hard to reach places. It's good at leaning crumbs, dirt, small objects, like my son's Cheerios, and hair.I didn't like how if you make a wrong move while cleaning, it will spew all the dirt out. It does pick up hair... however, for optimal result, you have to keep pulling off the hair that is tangled on the brushes, which is really a pain in the rear.It started to degrade with time... and finally died on me after five months of use. I would've preferred to spend more money to get something more decent."
2,I really wanted to like this product,"For the first 4 months I thought this product was a dream. I liked the fact that it was very light weight, great for quick pickups after meals. Then the problems started. First the battery lost its gusto, would only hold a charge for maybe 15 minutes. Next one of the clips on the top broke off. Then when the pole broke and there were wires showing I decided it was time to let it go. I am very sad at the failures of this product, I REALLY wanted to love it!"
1,Disappointing,"Wouldn't it be great if things really worked like they do in the advertisements? This little sweeper seemed like a good idea, but it just didn't work."
2,Returned after 3 uses,I used the sweeper 3 times and although it is not very strong it was useful. For whatever reason it can't be used anymore although the battery seems to be good. It is a dissapointment.
1,Disappointed,"I followed directions and charged the battery 8 hours, put it in the sweeper, and it worked great! For all of 10 minutes. Then it revved its motor, stopped, and has not worked again. We have tried charging the battery again, checked to make sure everything is where it's supposed to be, but all for nothing. The machine does not work. That was an expensive 10 minute sweeping job."
2,poor choice,"It is very difficult to insert the long pieces of the handle together.Also, I charged the battery for a full 24 hours to start and it worked for 15 minutes before needing a recharge. I would have been better off to purchase a light vacuum cleaner than this noisy broom."
2,Very Poor,I purchased this and only had it a week and a plastic part inside that spins the bottom bristles broke. I think they made this product very poorly..
3,Swivel sweep,"* Good pick-up* light weight, ease of use* battery could be a little stronger in power and hold charge longer."
2,Dissatisfied,"This item was a house gift and it did not work. I have this sweeper and love it, so very disappointed with this one."
1,The battery is junk!,"The sweeper could be a great product if the battery was not such a piece of junk. I would pull mine out of the charger after leaving it overnight, and it took only a few times before the battery hit the 5-minute mark for holding a charge. Bought two sweepers, and my partner's sweeper did the same thing. Don't buy it. It's a rip off."
2,Not worth the money,"Had the same experience....after 3 months, it would not hold a charge. Tried so many times to call the company and they put you on hold.I think the replacement battery charge is too much and if I bought it, it may not work. Would not recommend this to anyone."
2,Not worth the price,"I'd reach for my vacuum cleaner first. While this might be okay for a quick clean up on the linoleum, all it really is is a portable dust pan. There is no suction at all so it will pick up things on the floor surface, but the tray that the stuff goes into is minimal and requires emptying constantly. Add that to everything that accumulates on the rollers which need to be cleaned and it's more of a pain than anything."
3,"not a vacuum, but handy","Glides easily, agile in small spaces, no work at all. Doesn't pull dust out of carpet. Picks up loose crumbs, grass, dirt, hair, etc. Great small size to use in the bathroom around the cammode. Picks up crumbs under diningroom/kitchen table easily. Doesn't hold much in the dust cup compared to other cordless vacs but it's easy to empty. It has it's purpose but the eureka cordless I have is a real vacuum and sucks dirt and dust out of carpet. However, it isn't nearly as agile as the swivel sweeper and can't get in small spaces. I grab whichever one has battery time left and/or depending on the job that needs done. The Eureka cordless for around $29 is a much better deal if you have carpet. It gets a lot of dust and dirt. But the swivel sweeper is easier for floors. It can work on carpet but is essentially a motorized broom."
1,Horrible!!,"I bought the Swivel Sweeper Deluxe thinking to replace a Shark Cordless Professional Sweeper for small cleanups. Don't bother!! The dirt cup is teensy, the battery lasts about thirty seconds, it bogs downs and stops on any type of carpet. A total disappointment."
4,Love this product,I've had this sweeper for about 6 months. I haven't had any problems with the battery or the handle. I've seen complaints about both in reviews. This product does not replace a vacumn or good old fashion broom and mop. Its a great quick pick up. The handle and pole are not made of the strongest material but anything else would make this product heavy and cumbersome. With normal use neither the handle or pole should present a problem. I have two cats and this works wonders to do quick pickups of the kibble bits by their food bowl. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a product for quick sprucing. The product does not replace general cleaning with a vacumn.Edit: Shortly after writing this review this unit stopped working and was thrown in the trash. It has since been replaced with something different that has outlasted it. This is too expensive to need replacing in so short of time. Amazon won't let me reduce the stars I'd give this a 2 1/2
2,"good sweeper, lousy handle","The sweeper works well, but the handle broke within two months. The handle is composed of three sections that screw together, and one joint became wiggly. Later another joint broke in half. Another complaint is that the dirt pan is small and needs changing before the job is done, in some cases. I am shopping around for a better brand."
4,Love my sweeper,"I have really enjoyed using this sweeper. I use it on the stairs and don't have to lug the heavy vacuum. I have found it to be effective on both human and dog hair. Because it is so light weight, yet effective, I'm buying another for my elderly Mom.Yes, it's not ""turbo vac"", but does a great job in picking up almost everything."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this because of the ads on TV and a local TV station who did a bit called ""But, does it really do that?"" They said it did, but it really does not. To give an upside, it is easy and quick to use and does work on carpet. However, on my hardwood floors all it did was blow away the crumbs and dust so that I had to go over the area again and again at different angles. Plus, if you accidentally turn it over all of the debris inside spills out all over the floor. Last week I got so irritated with it that I threw it out the door over the deck and it crashed in the yard in pieces and that really did feel good!!"
3,decent,"For a sweeper this product is decent...do not expect it to do the work of your vaccuum though. My only problem with it is the metal pole. Mine split down the seam and must be replaced. I contacted the company and they will send a new one for a fee of $10.00 plus shipping, right now it's being held together with good ole Duct tape. I would recommend this product if the price is right. I keep it close by and use it often to pick up dirt that comes in the front door. One nice feature is the battery, it lasts quite a long time between recharging."
5,You can do a clean sweep with this!!,This is a really great product. We've had it for a few months and use it all the time. I recomment rechaging the battery only when it runs down. It should last for long time that way. It does eveything that it is claimed to do. We're thinking of getting one for our mothers.
2,High expectations,"This product is cheaply made therefore it's overpriced. The Swivel Sweeper infomercial offers free ""RUSH"" delivery. It's a good thing it does, because my rush delivery took more than three weeks to reach my home address.I wish the best of luck to new owners."
1,very disappointed,"It seems that I've had the same experience as others. After owning my little sweeper for a very short time, it started cutting out all of the time. It just wouldn't hold a charge, sometimes for more than a minute! Also, the nifty little brushes around the edges do really get into corners, etc., but don't let it go near any hair! I used it on the tile floor in the bathroom, and thought I'd never get the hair cut off with their little 'seam ripper' which they include with the product. I am very disappointed in this product."
2,Don't waste your money,"I've had the Swivel Sweeper for 5 months now. As stated in the other reviews, the commercial totally ""oversells"" this product. It has not broken or anything... It just doesn't do what you ""imagine"" it would do based on what is presented to you on the advertisement. It will pick up a tiny amount of material before spitting it back out in another area of your house while you continue to ""sweep"" with it. Well, when I vaccum, I let my 2 yr old play with it so she feels like she's ""helping mommy"" - Other than that, it's junk."
2,Not Quite What I was Hoping for,"My mother-in-law saw this sweeper on TV and asked for it for her birthday. I bought two, since my Shark sweeper is no longer holding its charge. I think I should have bought another Shark. The Ontel Sweeper is very light and the swivel head certainly swivels - almost to the point of not being able to control it. But I think the thing I dislike most about it, is the tray. It is so small and awkward to empty. I have three large dogs and I use the portable sweeper on my kitchen floor. The Ontel just isn't up to the job around here. Hopefully my dogless mother-in-law will enjoy hers when I give it to her next month."
1,Don't buy this,"This vacuum is very lightweight but is not well made. The plastic is so thin that the plastic cover broke the first week (I was pretty careful.)The battery charged for enough time to finish cleaning our kitchen and I was satisfied with what it picked up. However, if you swivel it (and that's what it is known for), it often flips over - especially on stairs. If it flips over or comes off the ground or even tilts at all, the dirt in the cup comes spewing out and you need a heavy duty vacuum to clean it up. Sounds like this wouldn't happen often but it does. After using it every day for a few months, it just died. I had a Bissel version of this and that one didn't last long either. These things are cheap but I hate that we are putting them in landfills and that I'm paying for a new one every few months.Is it that hard to make something that works longer than 3-4 months?"
2,Parts Fell Off,"Sweeper worked O.K. the first few days. When I put the sweeper over my trash can and opened the door on the bottom to empty sweeper, the unit with the door on the bottom fell off unbeknownest to me. The next time I used it, there was nothing to hold the dirt as I vacuumed the floors. Since I didn't know when it fell off, I had no way to send back to manufacturer. I have had two of these units for 3 years and know how they work. They work great on hard floors and are quick and easy."
2,Sweeper fault,"The sweeper itself works fine. This is our second one. But, when emptying the dust cup, the entire cup falls off instead of just swinging open. You then can pick the dust cup out of your trash. The other one of these sweepers perfect. What changed and why??"
3,Swivel Sweeper,"I'm not unhappy with my Swivel Sweeper, but if I knew then what I know now, I'd probably pass up its purchase. It's VERY good for getting under beds between those times when someone with muscles is around to move furniture for you. You still have to get down on the floor to do that, though, which at my age isn't much fun. It picks up really well, but I hate cleaning it. The handle is kinda flimsy, but works well if you don't whip it around all over the place. It holds its charge as I'd expect it to do for it's size, and it's great on throw rugs that have the latex backing. What you see on TV is what you get. The only thing you don't see on the commercials is that it's a noisy little bugger. And, I agree, it's over-priced."
3,A great little vacume -When it works,"I have owned my Swivel sweeper for 2 years now. When it works it is amazing. I love how light it is - my 18 month old could push it around. It is able to go under almost every piece of furnature without haveing to move it and it gets into courners beautifully. It's easy to empty and easy to clean.Here's the rub, the directions explicitly say not to charge the battery over 8 hours, but if you're like me you naturally charge everything else (phones PDAs camera batteries ect) overnight so you have a freash chage in the morning. If you leave the battery on the charger too long it KILLS the batery. I was very careful witht eh first battery and it only lasted me 1 year. My second battery is barely holding on to life - it will work for maybe 20 seconds before dying. At $10 a pop I cannot afford to keep buying batteries, and as a busy mom I cannot keep track of a high maintance battery that needs to be coddled and taken off the charger after an hour."
2,"Swivel Sweeper good, Battery charger bad.",The Swivel Sweeper is good but the charger is bad. It has no overcharge protection and has fried two batteries for me. A 7 hr charge on a new battery produced about 6 feet of sweeping and quit. I will go back to myElect. Broom with a cord.
3,"Sweeper, Amazing.... Battery, CRAP!!","I have no problems with the sweeper, it's designed well, it works as advertised. It picks up dirt from all four directions and I'm surprised at the amount of stuff it picked up from the kitchen floor that I didn't even know was there.The battery was OBVIOUSLY provided by the lowest bidder. I've had my sweeper for less than a year and I leave the battery on the charger overnight, take the battery off the charger and place it in the sweeper and turn it on.... the sweeper runs slower than a turtle with 3 bad feet going uphill...A higher quality battery may increase the cost from the beloved ""as-seen-on-tv price of $19.95, but it would have DEFINITELY improved my rating of this product.Now... off to spend another ten bucks on a new battery..."
5,What a cool little swiffer!,"It works beautifully in every corner, floor and low carpet areas. I have retired my broom!I first met my swivel friend in Petaluma CA, when I was visiting a close friend of mine. While sitting at the kitchen table and not really paying attention, I heard this little engine noise and looked up and met the swivel sweeper! ""This is the coolest"" says my friend. I immediately went to her computer and ordered it. It arrived 3 days after my return to Port Townsend WA! I LOVE IT!"
1,Swivel Sweeper G2,"This product is ok, but I have had nothing but trouble with the payment.They billed me more than two times! I talked to them on the phone and had my credit card company try to fix things, but after 6 months, it still has not been taken care of. BE CAREFUL when using a credit card with this company. I think they make their money by overbilling and never resolving things. This product is certainly not worth the hassle!!!"
3,satisfied kinda,"Not too bad, but site was a little confusing, thought I was ordering the top of the line, but got the original"
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought the G2 (red version) of this in June and by September the battery would no longer work. I was careful to follow the instructions and not leave in the battery in the charger too long. I also had the original black one for several years before it died which I felt was reasonable for a $40 vacuum (and I was happy with its performance). This was only lasted my 4 months and never worked as good as the original. Based on the other reviews it doesn't look like the company will do anything about it. I may try and return to bed, bath, & beyond where I purchased it from since I still have the receipt. In the meantime I just purchased a similar one by Bissell from Lowes for $40 and bought the extended warranty for $7 dollars. Lowes will replace the item one time if it breaks in the 2 years following the manufacture warranty and all I have to do is bring it back to Lowes. I figured out there is a very good chance it will not last the 2+ years so the warranty was a good buy."
1,Afte4r 1 day it breaks?,"The first day after i received this sweeper i used it once and the handle broke. The ""motor"" that powers it also screeches. i own another one I purchased from the manufacturer website, and bought one for my Mother too-neither of which i have ever had any problems with."
1,Swivel Sweeper quickly gives out,"I ordered the Swivel Sweeper because I am ill and cannot manage even a small vacuum. I've used it only several times. Now all of a sudden the battery charger is not working. I called the company, Ontek, and they have all sorts of excuses and tell me to go to Amazon since I purchased it here. I hope Amazon will honor the 90-day warranty, not even 2 months has gone by. Ontek is another example of a company that sells products and doesn't care a bit about whether they work or not."
1,Not happy!!!!,"I ordered two of these. One for me and one for a friend's Birthday. I put mine together and charged thebattery overnite. The next day I used it and it only ran for 3 to 5 min., then quit. I couldn't believe it!!I have several Swivel Sweepers and this has never happened!!! I am very disappointed and I hope my Birthdaypresent for my friend DOES work??!!! I, also, thought I was getting the Red Swivel sweeper (it showed a pictureof the Red one next to the order box,) but I GOT 2 bLACK ONES??!!i do want a refund on my black one!!!!Not happyGeorgia"
3,Works good - Battery is crap,"I loved my Swivel Sweeper when I first got it. After less than a year I noticed it dying sooner on the battery & limited power. Within a few more uses, the battery stopped working. Since it costs about a 1/3 the price of a new sweeper for a replacement battery, I just left it in the closet. Waste of money unless the battery works!"
1,Don't Purchase!,Worked great for about 2 weeks and then it broke. Returned it and purchased another -- broke in a matter of hours! I tossed it in the dumpster.
1,RIP OFF,"When this sweeper works, it's great!! Mine stopped after about 4 days. I had to mail it back with $12.99 to pay to have it sent back IF they fixed it. It's been three weeks and I haven't heard a thing. Buy a better quality product and save your money."
2,not worth the money,Please save your money. I purchased mine after reading a glowing review. This items is cheaply made and will not stand up. I paid $70.CAD plus shipping and taxes and will send it back. It does not live up to it's powerful billing. Dust and cat hair just get blown around. The canister holds next to nothing. The two mini sweepers are just a joke. There must be better products for the money. On the plus side it is small and easy to manuever and better on carpets than hardwood. The cons outway any pros.
2,Seam Ripper???,"I would normally give this product 1 star but it did pick up everything so I gave it 2; however, when I got my Swivel Sweeper I couldn't figure out why they included a seam ripper. After reading the instructions it stated to use it to clean the brushes...OK not a problem. Well I have two long hair cats and every thing I just swept up got caught around the brushes. I took me 3 times as long to clean the brushes than it did to sweep the house. I bought this to save me some time...what a joke!"
5,swivel sweeper,"This is an awesome product,it's very easy to use and lightweight.It gets in the hard to reach places without much effort,this is a great alternative to using a broom!I'm thinking about getting a second one for the other end of the house."
1,"Horrible Piece of Garbage As Expected from ""As Seen On TV"" Carp","Do not buy this product and support this company with your money. It does an absolute horrendous job with picking up debris from wooden floor, and especially carpeted floors. Hardly ever picks up hair or cotton fluff at all. Annoying to clean out because the strands that it does pick up end up getting tangled throughout the black spin fibers. The garbage collector is so tiny, it's positively worthless; you might as well be pushing dirt around the floor in circles with a stick. Construction of the product is so flimsy, it's ridiculous. It's like they used cardboard.Battery dies within almost one use. It doesn't help that the charger is barbarically sized and takes up an entire double outlet. Plus the inside of my battery decided to melt a little, which is just fantastic.Never buy this, ever. In fact, never buy anything from those ""As Seen On TV"" annoying ads. They're all liars."
5,It still works.,"This is my fourth sweeper. They all died on me after a short time, but I like it so much when it works that I tried it one more time."
3,I'd pay twice as much for a sturdy version,"This does an amazing job sweeping. My kids love it, so they sweep after meals. This is all good. The problem is the quality is so low as to render the sweeper disposable.If the same mechanism was built by Leifheit, or some other quality brand, this sweeper would rock. As it is, I can't see buying a new one every 3-4 months for $30 a pop."
1,Not up to hype,"I agree with Sherrie, this is a waste of money , it bogs down on pile carpets,and the battery only lasts about 10 min. Go back to the shark."
1,Worthless after too short a time,"Like many others, I found out only after buying this crappy product, that the battery only has a short life. The whole thing worked great when I first got it - hard surface floors, carpets, light weight, easy to use. I was always very careful to only leave the battery plugged in the charge no longer than directed. Even so, after just a month or two, the thing has died. It'll hold a charge for no more than a few minutes. It would get five stars with a working power source. As is, it's a complete waste of money and is going in the garbage."
3,Good but....,"The product is handy for small jobs and pick ups but the battery has a short life and hard to find and expensive. Follow battery care instructions and before the original dies shop for replacement or buy a new one on sale, which would be cheaper. The concept is great and wish the materials used were of better quality and the batteries cheaper."
2,It WAS a great product,"I bought this sweeper about a year and half ago. Really like it for quick cleanups. Worked great on hardwood and low pile carpet. The sweeper started to lock up toward the end. It would run over the floor for about a minute and half and just stop. So, I figured I'd just order a new one and save the old one for backup parts. I got the new one and charged it following the guidelines of the booklet. Well, guess what, the new one didn't run any longer than the old one after a year and half. It's really too bad, because I really liked the old one for the time it worked. The company could really have a great product, if they'd work out the bugs with the battery."
3,ok...,"The first one we received literally worked for about 4 minutes, then completely died. I feel like the replacement one is going to die in the future as well (the motor sounds like it is working way too hard), but it gets the job done for now."
2,Bad Customer Service!!!,Sweeper came with a defective battery have made several requests for fresh/new one!!! Still no response and no new battery!!!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE !,"What a waste of money ! I fell for the TV ad, which promised me 2 of them for the price of one. Well, I got them. One, of course, was broken. It was too hard to find a real person to complain to and I had lost my reciept. Anyway, Im glad that I had the Extra battery . This thing runs out of charge before a large room is done, and i need to switch batteries. Not only that, it is made so cheaply that sometimes it just comes apart, and all the debris comes out of the holding compartment unexpectedly. It does okay with crumbs and that type of thing, but it wont even pick up paper shreds ! My house is full of kids and alot of my problem is little bits of wrappers and various paper trash left around. My old dirt devil worked way better. Of course, that didnt last a year either. I guess theres no quick way to do this. Get out the real vaccuum."
2,"Great for cat hair, but ridiculously short battery life.","I have two cats, and I was amazed at how well this little sweeper picked up cat hair I couldn't even see. It didn't pick up much else, but that was ok with me since cat hair is my biggest housecleaning problem. I had been singing the praises of my sweeper to anyone who would listen, but the other day, the battery completely died. I can't recharge it at all, and the sweeper isn't even three months old. I had read the directions before I used the sweeper, so I was careful not to overcharge the battery, but it is completely dead now anyway. I hope I can find another cordless sweeper that is as convenient but much more reliable. It's a real disappointment to find something so good that is made so poorly."
3,great for small jobs like hardwoods but not carpet.,"Its not made for heavy clean up, but it's great for getting the pet hair up on hard surfaces not to good on rugs, I would recommend this product for that hurry up job."
2,"Good, but doesn't last","I've had mine for about one year, and as of today, I am shopping for a replacement, and it won't be a swivel sweeper.Pro's, light, fairly effective, fairly easy to cleanCon's, hair clogs the bristles very rapidly, and then it is not effective at all, and deal breaker was ni-cad battery has the ""memory"" issue, and now one year later, the length of a full charge cannot even cover a tiny bathroom."
2,Vaccuum gets 4 Stars... But the Battery? None.,"This product picks up small pieces of dirt and debris on a low pile carpet or bare floor very well. I also like the dirt ""escape hatch"" that releases to have the dirt fall into the trash without having to get my hands dirty. However, 2 months into owning this unit, the battery began failing to charge. Now I have to go out and spend more money on a replacement rechargeable battery."
3,Sweeper,"The sweeper is OK, but not great. It does not pick up hair as well as I thought it would.Carol"
2,Great WHEN & IF it works ...,"I was given a Swivel Sweeper by a friend and enjoyed it for about 3 weeks. I used it every day and it charged ok in the beginning. Now it charges and runs for about 15 seconds and dies. Unfortunately, I bought 3 others to give as gifts. I will explain the battery situation to each of the gals I give it to and if theirs continues to work ok, I will purchase a replacement battery.....I think the manufacturer has made an error somewhere along the way and even so, will make a lot of money on this item.....I really, really liked it when it worked and I found that I was cleaning up more often because it was so easy. I have 6 rooms that are completely tiled and the Sweeper worked great until the battery died."
4,Convenient,"It does what it is supposed to do, providing convenient cleaning aid for light jobs. It is a fragile tool, so you need to handle it with care. Cleaning the hair that gets tangled is very hard, and thus teh reason for the 4 stars"
1,Not Happy,"My first swivel sweeper (which was black in color) was just great but this one (red) is terrible...will not hold a charge and the handle is very loose and acts like it will break.....I do not use it anymore, I went and bought a Bissell Perfect Sweep Turbo. I was always a firm believer in the Swivel Sweeper...bought about a total of 5 of the black ones, one for me and each Grandchild got one."
3,Older model,"This sweeper is the older model. They have improved it so you dont have to touch the dirt compartment. Also, the newer model has a bending handle for getting under short cabinets, etc.Although it is cheaper, I love the newer model Swivel Sweeper much better."
4,A favorite,I have 2 units and am purchasing a 3rd as a gift. My first only lasted 4 years before I was unable to recharge the battery the 2nd is 3 years old and running strong. I like it better than the Bissel as I am able to get behind the toilet and under more things with the Swivel.
2,Cheap Chinese products,"I have bought Swivel Sweepers in the past, and they have all worked very well. This one instantly showed signs of poor quality. It made twice as much noise as others, and it quickly loses power when being used, especially on a carpeted floor."
1,Don't Buy This One,"I strongly recommend against purchasing the Swivel Sweeper. The idea is good, but the quality is terrible. Battery life is less than 1 minute. After purchasing a replacement battery and charging it exactly as indicated by the directions, the battery lasts approximately 30 seconds - $20 down the drain. Surely someone, even in China, can do better than this with battery technology."
3,"Get the G2, much better for battery life.","Used this model for about 1 year before the battery only lasted about 30 seconds. Got the G2 and it has a better battery that will last 45 min. You can buy just the updated battery and it will work on the G1. Get the NiMH Battery (comes with the G2, not this one)!"
1,Do Not Buy This,Do not buy this product!!! I could not even complete one flight of stairs without it dying on me about 8 times. I had to clean it out and untangle it over and over. If I was not working on my anger I would have thrown it against the wall.
1,A Disappointment,"This product is made cheaply, works good for the first couple of times then it peters out. Bought many as gifts for people and they said the same thing. Worked for a bit, then nothing. Waste of money!!"
1,Handle very cheaply made,"Just want to add to the many complaints, especially those regarding cheap construction. The item works great, but only on its second use, the handle broke. No abuse, just shabby construction. If you examing the handle carefully, you can see very clearly, that the break occurred at a weak point in the handle. We haven't followed up on the warranty yet, but judging from the reviews, I'm not expecting the outcome to be good. Will never recommend this product to anyone!!!"
1,Battery Charge died in 2 minuts,Nothing mush to say...I charged the battery more than 6 hours and tried use the product for 2 minuts... Battery died...
1,Not at all worth it.,"This product does not work on hard surfaces - it mainly shuffles particles around. On a very low carpet it works well, however the battery (which needs to be charged for 8 hours to get a maximum charge) does not last more than 2 minutes on carpet making it not worth the purchase."
3,"Great sweeper, bad battery","This sweeper is great! Love how it gets in the corners and swivels. It picks up messes with ease. Too bad the battery stinks. It only takes one time of over charging to make it virtually useless. 30 second run time and it starts dying. Just too inconvenient to have to watch the clock in order to charge it up just right. (have purchased replacement batteries, same deal)"
2,You love it - then you hate it!,"I've had two Swivel Sweepers. L-0-V-E-D them both until that fateful day when the charger won't hold a charge anymore after 5 or so minutes of sweeping. I guess I could buy a new one each time it bonks out but then I'd be waiting again for that fateful day when it won't hold the charge anymore. I don't think a new charger is available for purchase; could be wrong on that. But if it was, it'd probably be $15 at least which is half the price of the old sweeper. Manufacturer should tell you (haha) this product has a limited life. You love it - then you hate it!"
3,Overall Opinion,We are on our 4th swivel sweeper. It goes in places our vacuum can't get to. It's light. We use it daily.Our regular vacuum once a week. It's ease of use is impressive. The downside. The batteries don't hold up as long as we would like. The plastic gears wear out requireing we buy a new sweeper every now and then. The one we have now purchased thru Amazon is a second. The Batteriy on the handle is not in the right place making it harder to use. Also some of the brushes are missing. However the overall ease of use makes it a further buy.
4,Battery Charging Hints,"DO NOT use sweeper (out of box) until battery is charged for 8 hrs (NO LONGER THAN 8 hrs)!!!DO NOT recharge battery until fully drained of powerDO NOT re-charge for more than 6 to 8 hrs....Battery MUST be taken off charger!!!!!or start buying battery after battery...also that 24 hrs crap, only weakens batteriesand guess who makes the replacement batteries!! Remember..(NO MORE THAN 6 to 8 HR RE-CHARGE!!)Another problem is string and thread gets wrapped around moving parts and must be removed..This will stop sweeper and shorten battery life!!"
1,Another Dead Battery,I can only add my bad experience to all of the other negative reviews here. Our battery died and the three other people that bought the swivel sweeper after seeing ours have all had their sweepers die as well. Buy this sweeper only if you like frustration with low quality junk!
2,not too good!,works pretty well on hardwood or tile but not on carpet. Had to go over the same spot several times and then sometimes it still wouldn't sweep it up. Would not recommend.
1,Great if it works!,I purchased this product after seeing a friend use it. One sweeper worked fine the other did not. I purchased extra batteries and a smart charger. It didn't help. I then had to purchase a new pole. The problem was the original unit - it was not anything I did. The pole should have been free.There is no guarantee that the problem will be solved.
1,Rip off,When I tried to turn on sweeper battery was dead. I charged per instructions still no luck. Tried to contact the seller and they wouldn't even respond back to exchange for a battery that worked. Very disappointed in seller and product.
1,negative stars,I bought this wwivel sweeper and they charged me monthly fees for signing up for something that I never did. It cost me over $160 for these monthly fees. Do not I say do not buy thgis product or they will do the same thing to you.
2,Delayed disappointment,"I owned the Swivel Sweeper for 2 months before it broke. I would have given it 4 - 5 stars before it broke but not anymore. It does a great job of getting up all the visible dirt, hair, debris, etc. from hard surface flooring and floormats. I have no carpet in my house so I cannot rate it on that. It's easy enough to use that my 3-year old loves to help out. The problem is that something in the gearbox must have broken because the motor makes noise but the brushes don't turn. Because I am still in the 90-day warranty period, I was given the option of sending another $12.99 (handling fee) to have the unit replaced or return it for a refund of the $40 purchase price. I haven't decided yet. I've already spent ~$55 with the purchase price and ridiculous $15 S&H. I'm not so sure I want to spend another $20 ($7 to send it to them and $13 handling charge) to get another one. It's just a little too cheaply built. I'd expect to pay $15 - $20 for the item at Target/Wal-mart."
1,Swindled by the Swivel Sweeper,What a piece of junk. I purchased this through BB&B for use on my new hardwood floors and it worked great the first 3 times or so I used it. Then the battery would start dying after 5-10 minutes of use despite the fact that it had been charging for days. I no longer had the receipt/box to return the item. I emailed Ontel directly and never heard from them. Please save your money and buy something that will work for many many years to come rather than days.
5,Where are you?,I have purchased a Swivel Sweeper based on my daughter's delight with her's. I am delighted as well with the sweeper. However my sweeper is missing the see through cover on it's top. I have been unable to reach anyone to have it replaced or at least get the part. Please help!!!Carol Scheller-Bergin
1,as soon as you touch the corners it brok this item is way expencive for the quality .and i ask to return it they say i have to p,Length:: 0:08 Minsas soon as you touch the corners it brok this item is way expencive for the quality .and i ask to return it they say i have to pay sheeping and is same like im buying a new one do not buy it and plus the charge is good for 5 or 8 minute
1,Does a Good Job,"This product is great for just a quick ""sweep"" job. It is not intended to be used as a vaccuum; however, I was surprised by the ""pick-up"" power. I purchased one for myself earlier this year, and love it, so I purchased 2 more for Christmas gifts. It's not heavy and easy to maneuver. Highly recommend for the easy sweep jobs."
1,Thanks for sharing your reviews,"(The 1 star is going by the reviews) I was really excited to finally order something that would work great on my hard wood floors I placed an order for my swivel on Friday. Well let me tell you that now I'm cancelling it, I should have read reviews first, boy what a disappointment to hear all the troubles and wasted money, but than again when does anything in an infomerical work.... Well reviewers thanks again for the info and for saving a hole in my pocket. If anyone out there has a recommendation please drop me a line it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks"
1,ripped offed,"this is the worst sweeper I have ever wasted my money on.The customer servicelied when I ordered I was told I would get a second battery, When it arrivedwithout I called and was told that I was wrong that No one told me that and I got the Deluxe model and that was an up grade and I if I didn't like ittuff Just send it back. Now I wish I had it is just JUNK!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
1,Ineffective product for hardwood floors,"I have been very disappointed in the swivel sweeper due to the fact that it kicks up an enormous amount of dust as it vacuums. I need to sweep or vacuum my hardwood floors daily (two dogs, two cats), and if I use the swivel sweeper, I also have to dust the entire house. Even a normal broom generates less dust than this thing. So all in all, it has not saved me any time or inconvenience. It's overpriced as well when you add in the exorbitant shipping charges."
2,"Great when new, but then battery dies...","I too was seduced by the great infomercial for this sweeper and bought it. It was great in the beginning and I got rid of my cordless shark. It is so much more flexible and versatile in cleaning and lightweight.But the problem with this product is the battery. It quickly runs down. I've probably had the sweeper for about 6 months now, and use it regularly. I fully charge the battery, and can get at most two minutes out of it before the sweeper dies.I went to the swivel sweeper website and the replacement battery is 14.99+5.99 S&H.; I think I bought the swivel sweeper for 19.99. They need to use a more reliable battery for this product. If they can do that, I would definitely buy it again. For now, I don't recommend this product."
3,"Works well, except for dog hair.","I haven't had any difficultly with this product, except it's no good with dog hair. The hair gets wrapped around the brushes constantly and is very difficult and time consuming to remove from the brushes. It's fine for crumbs and other small bits, but not hair.The location of the battery makes it hard to get under beds, etc. But they have a new version that folds the bar down, so that should help."
4,Wonderful item,This is a must have for my cleaning chores. It works great and gets under the edges of the counters and many other places that it is so hard to get with a regular vacume. Light weight and manuvers easily.
2,Embarassing,"If I were the manufacturer of this product, I would be embarrassed. I am very disappointed as to what this product can't pick up. It should easily pick up the small peices of crumbs that they advertise, but it doesn' pick up a lot of things. And when you finally get it to pick up the debris, it spits it out later while you are trying to pick up other items. I have a very thin carpet and hardwood floors and it struggles. It also makes a lot of noise when on the hardwood floors."
2,SMALL JOB SWEEPER,"WORKS OK ON HARD FLOORS AND CARPET AND TIGHT SPOTS,LIKE IT SAYS.BUT HAIR GETS WRAP-UP AROUND THE BRUSHES AND YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THE HAIR OFF AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK IF YOU USE IT ALOT,OR IT WILL BREAK LIKE MINE DID [MY FAULT] I TOOK MINE APART ITS ALL PLASTIC SO IT WILL BREAK EASY!THE BATTERY LAST LONG TIME FOR A NO NAME SWEEPER.OK FOR SMALL JOBS NOT LIKE THE TV SPOT SAYS YOU COULD REPLACE YOUR UPRIGHT JUST ABOUT!YEA RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Horrible!!,"I had high expectations of this product, my floors are all hardwood and I hate to see dust in it. I use this every single day and after 2 weeks eventhough I was using the tools to clean it, it started to have everything around the bristles ( specially hair) and stop working soon after that. It's almost imposible to remove the things that get attached to the bristles!!! I would never buy this again!!!"
3,Swivel Sweeper OK,"It was a little louder than we thought it would be. It does a pretty good job of sweeping, not as good as a powerful vacuum cleaner. We are pleased with it, though. The kids don't mind sweeping the floors when asked, because the Swivel Sweeper is fun to use."
1,Swivel Sweeper,"I bought this as a gift, because we liked the one we bought. This one never worked. I was embarressed to have given it as a gift. It was returned to the company and the recipient had to pay $13.00 to send it back. Very disappointing."
1,Zero Stars,"Same as other reviewers, the battery is the problem with this device. It will not hold a charge and will only last 30 seconds before needing a new charge or the terminals being cleaned. Otherwise, it is a good product for what I need it for-quick cleaning of crumbs under the table and bar after meals, getting dust bunnies out from under low pieces of furniture. It wasn't designed for more in depth cleaning. You will need your big gun for that. I have an Oreck. Nothing compares to that."
1,Sweeper,Do not buy!!! I enjoyed the sweeper for barely a week .The charge did not last. It did not pick up as promised and it was very loud. I was not able able to use it while the baby slept upstairs. It was a total waste of money. I would not recommend this product to anyone!!
1,Cordless Swivel sweeper,"I purchased one of these years ago & wore it out,loved it,so bought another one. This one does not work near as well. Wish I had never gotten it."
3,"Great at first, poor in the long run","I received the Swivel Sweeper for Christmas 2006 and was very pleased with it in the beginning. It swept well and the swivel head almost made cleaning fun. BUT, in less than a year the rechargable battery would no longer take a full charge and I had to spend another $25 for a new battery. Even with the new battery, the sweeper's performance really declined to the point that I'm now shopping for a replacement vac. While I loved the Swivel Sweeper for the first 10 months, I will not be buying a new one to replace my old one."
2,Get ready to by a new battery!,"We have owned the swivel sweeper for 8 months. It worked pretty well for a while. Now, the battery will not hold a charge very long and it only works for about 7 minutes. Realizing that we need a new batrery, I checked into it. It is 14.95 and 7.00 for shipping. 7.00 for shipping a small battery? This company is really charging 18.00 for the battery because they could ship it for less. They are just adding shipping as a way to generate more income for them. It does not cost 7.00 to ship a battery that weighs less than a pound. They think the public is stupid. Typical of TV stuff and we shouldnt have expected more. I will buy a different brand rather than give this company anymore of my money. Why would I pay 21.00 for a new battery when I can buy a new swivel sweeper for 10 bucks more. But hello....I am not buying a new one. This product could prove expensive to operate over a period of time."
1,Don't bother with this product,"I had one of these for about three months. It worked ok initially as long as I was careful not to let all the detritus fall out of the container. That happened a couple times -- very annoying.The real lame part of this product is the battery, which is absolutely terrible. There are very stringent charging requirements and even if you follow those to the letter, the battery still wears out. I think I used mine all of a dozen times. The whole unit went in the trash today when I discovered the battery to be dead beyond repair and that the replacements are $10. No thanks. I'll stick with my Dyson, even if it is bigger and heavier... Hey, at least it works."
1,Dissatisfied,The first day I used it the plastic covering broke I don't recommend this to anyone I had one before and I did not have a problem with it. But this one doesn't seem as sturdy as the last.
5,Cordless Swivel Sweeper,This is an extremely good product; it works as advertised; it works very well; it is very easy to use;
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"My last sweeper broke (the plastic cover when I was cleaning it) and I was anxious to get a new one. I tried to use this one to pick up hair after giving a haircut, and it just dept spreading the hair around my floor. So disappointed. Nothing like my last one. I would no recommend this."
1,Product not same as advertised,Was an earlier model tha that advertised and both the battery and charger were faulty. We have purchased two of these in previoua years and were very pleased with there operation and quality.Looks like they are trying to unload some old models. Requested the replace it with the latest model and was told to throw it away and a credit would be issued.
1,useless,I bought this and returned it two days later. Battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than 5-10 minutes (package says will run for 45 minutes). I wanted it for mostly picking up pet hair - what it did bother to pick up ended up all over the unit instead of in the collection cup. Took it back and got a refund...
4,Works Well for Spot Cleaning,"We use product for spot clean-up and it works well. Would not use it to clean large areas. The disposal compartment works easily. We have had product for two months, so far holding up well."
5,swivel sweeper works!,Swivel sweeper does the job. A very strong pick up for a battery operated device. The swiveling action allows you to get into even those hard to reach corners and it's very easy to clean. You just pop out the back and empty.
3,Just okay...,This product worked great at first. I thought it was going to be a lifesaver to help me quickly pick up dog hair off of our hardwood floors daily. It did...for the first few months. It doesn't work anymore and I'm going to *try* a replacement battery in the hopes that this solves the problem. It may just be the battery doesn't charge fully anymore.What it is good for:Pet hairLight dirtWhat it is bad for:Dust bunnies (blows them away!)Bird feathers (same thing)Larger pieces of dirt such as a spilled houseplantThrow rugs (get sucked up and unit stops)Any area that happens to be dirty and damp at the same time.
2,Doesn't Last,"I saw this litte sweeper reviewed on TV. They said it did a great job, so I bought one. They were right! It did a great job - for a while. Now even though I charge the battery, it goes really slow and hardly picks up anything. I'm not sure why - it seems like the battery won't even charge or something....."
2,Ontel Touchless Swivel Sweeper,"Took mine back tonight! It worked for little crumbs and that's about it. My kids drag grass clippings in the house and it just flung them, actually it just flung pretty much everything. Found myself wanting to throw the thing after a while. Tried giving it a few days but in general I just think it a cheap product. It IS very light but does not get the job done.Ontel Touchless Swivel SweeperCordless Swivel Sweeper ' Original As Seen on TV by Swivel SweeperCordless Swivel Sweeper ' Original As Seen on TV by Swivel Sweeper"
2,I was disappointed,I expected something a little sturdier than this flimsy light weight product that I doubt will last very long. However I should have known that from the low price that was asked for the product . You get what you pay for in this world and it is foolish to expect quality unless you pay enough to expect it.
1,Dead Battery,"The battery is supposed to last 45 minutes fully charged. The brand new battery only sweeps 10 minutes! But, the As Seen on TV guys are providing good customer service by sending me another. I hope it works, for the additional $5 spent on S&H"
1,Do Not Buy This Piece Of Junk!,"Plastic junk, poor pick-up, constant dead battery, finally died after 3 months. Good-bye $40.00, hello garbage can."
1,Piece of Junk,"Had high hopes for this machine. First two times I used it, it worked fine. Third time it started to fail. Would only run one or two minutes on a full charge. Would run okay till I put it on the floor. Then it would do a couple of passes and die. Didn't make any difference whether it was bare floor or area rug.Very disappointed."
4,like it but.....,"I do like my sweeper it comes in handy after meal time with a 16 month old. It picks up almost any type of food my daughter throws in the floor even damp food. But it stops working during use especially if you touch the edge of the rug with it. And you can not use it on carpet, as soon as it touches the carpet it stops working. Once it stops you have to wait a couple of mins before it will work again."
3,Disappointed,"This is my 2nd Swivel Sweeper and love it for quick clean ups. But this model did not have the one touch to empty the dust collector, which was very disappointing."
4,I really liked this till battery died....,I got this for Christmas alomst 2 years ago. I used it off and on quite often. Then I wasn't able to use it for about a month and we have no decided it's the battery. It will work for about 30 seconds you then have to shut it off for a minute or two and then can run it for 30 seconds again. A new battery is 20? Really I can get a competelly new one for 27?
1,this is junk,"Be warned,do not buy it is a waste of money. battery does not hold charge.I know it does not get deep dirt out of carpets. but it bogs down and stops on my wood floor. do not buy........."
1,Picks up very little...,The Swivel Sweeper I purchased only picks up very small things and often will pick things up and spit them back out. Not worth the money.
1,Battery does not last,"At first, this worked just fine. I showed it to friends who went out and purchased it too. Now...it does not work. The retail store has stopped carrying the product (good for them) and the company that makes it requires you to pay shipping costs both ways to fulfill the warranty...essentially repeating the cost of the bad purchase you've already made. Maybe I recharged the battery too long; realistically, who has patience to monitor recharge times. If you want something that will last more than four months, don't buy this."
1,Loved at first-didn't last long.,"I loved my mother's sweeper so much I bought my mother-in-law and myself one. I just loved the product for quick messes with four children. Needless to say, good things don't last long. Within 6 months, all three sweepers no longer work. I could say that maybe I used it too much (once to twice a week) but I know the other two were not heavily used. I loved the product but the price is too high for the short life."
3,Is ok for the money,"Finally broke down and bought this sweeper at Ross for 24.99 after myShark vac broke. It is a good little vacuum and all, but I wish I had bought the g2 version instead or just saved my money for something else."
3,swivel sweeper,"I use this several times every day and love that it is much easier than a regular broom. It works very well on all types of surfaces and with many types of ""dirt"". I would recommend this product, but it does not keep a charge as long as I was hoping. It seems to wear down quickly on carpeted surfaces and area rugs. Overall it is still much better than dragging out the regular vacuum as often as I need to sweep."
2,Money thrown away!!!!,"VERY SIMPLE REVIEW: This does not pick up anything from carpet. Hair tangles in the brushes, and it stops turning. It takes longer to clean the vacuum than if I hand-picked dirt from the carpet myself. I have a spare in a box, and wouldn't give it away to anyone....why should they have to deal with it. BAD BUY!!!"
5,"For Hardwood and tile floors, this thing is WONDERFUL!","Hello thee review junkie! :) Hee hee..I'm one myself..but getting to the point-->LOVE IT!! I've never seen the commercial. My mom sent it to me as a gift....and boy was it one of my favorite gifts so far. My WHOLE house is hardwood or tile and let me tell you, it cleans up floors as fast as it takes you to scale the house. I use it daily and I know it works well because I can see it working and walk around barefoot after without any annoying clingers on the bottom of my feet. I like to use it on bathroom rugs too, but that seems to slow down the motor so you have to lift it up above the carpet a little. The battery works well. I can do the whole house without it dying. Its great! I haven't used a broom or dustpan since!!! :) Well....there was the time the hubby broke a light bulb...but you know what I'm saying. ;)"
4,Swivel Sweeper,"On the positive side, it does an excellent job of sweeping the floor. On the negative side, the battery has to be recharged after only about 6 or 7 minutes of use."
1,very poor design. very cheaply made.,a broom worked much better. this broke 2 days after i used it. doesn't pick up anything. very disappointed. don't buy this immitation product. it is not the same as 'seen on TV'.
2,Fair,this is the ssecond Swivel Sweeper I've purchased & this one seems somewhat slow even after I've charged it up.
4,Excellent when used properly,"I've been using my Swivel Sweeper daily for almost a year now, and it still works very well. The keys to that success are that 1) I never charge the battery more than 6-8 hours; 2) I charge it only when it starts to run down, and 3) I don't slam the sweeper around. As I said in a review elsewhere, this is not a $600 built-like-a-tank Electrolux. If you abuse it, it will break. But if you treat it with reasonable care, it'll keep working for a long time. After ten months of use, I still love my Swivel Sweeper!"
1,Not What You'd Expect,"This sweeper can only pick up a little bit of dust and dirt at a time. The area containing the dirt is no bigger than a deck of cards. That means that if you have pet hair, you can only make a swipe or two before it is full and you need to empty it.It may just be me, but I expected this to have some suction or something. It does not. The battery powers the brushes and that is all.I didn't feel that it picked up well and I was just using it to run over our hard wood floors each night.I ended up returning the item. I thought it was junk."
3,Good product for its price,"I have the swivel sweeper for a month and found it satisfatory considering its price. Don't expect too much for just $35 product. I replaced my old, heavy, noisy, and dysfunctional vaccum with this swivel sweeper. It is very light in weight and easy to use compare to my old one; however, the suction is not as powerful as advertised. It can do the basic but not the toughest job. With the price, I'm happy with the job it can do so far."
5,"great product,great price",I like it.Makes sweep up easy.I would recommend this to a friend.Thinking of purchasing a second one for a friend
1,Don't waste your money,"Just what the title says. Don't waste your money.I bought the buy one get one free on the website. One doesn't work and it's not the battery. I gave my neighbors the one that works and they ended up giving it back to me since mine didn't. They said it doesn't do anything anyway. It's true. It does nothing but make noise, it doesn't pick anything up. Some people say it's basically an electric dust pan. Perhaps I'll try using it on that. I was hoping for something that would make vacuuming up the steps easier. Nope! 70 bucks down the drain. I never return anything, but I will write a review so no one makes the same mistake. You thinking of buying one? You can have mine for free. I don't even want to see them anymore. Oh, what a waste!"
1,"Paid for new, got used.",The sweeper works but I paid the 29.99 for a new unit and what I got was a used unit that someone had made a poor attempt at cleaning. I will be filing a complaint just as soon as I can find a complain area here.
1,Lasted for one week!!!!! Horrible product!!,"I see many have already stated the obvious. This thing is trash. It worked for 20 good minutes the first time I used it. After that, the battery wouldnt last 10 minutes if even that. Now, it wont even last 3 minutes. I hear they charge you to replace the battery too. Forget it!! Don't waste your money on this piece of crap!!"
5,Better than I expected,"OK! I never write reviews even though I have never been disappointed about any item I have ordered from Amazon. The swivel sweeper is great (and I have bought a bunch of cleaning items that don't work and I still wish I had a magic wand that would just sweep all this mess away.)I am in my late 60's, have 2 cats and with 2 hip and 2 back surgeries, I can't bend over to sweep so this item is great for picking up loose litter, paper scraps from my shredder, etc., etc. I love it!"
2,not worth it,"The sweeper does pick up very light 'debri' from hardfloors, but it does not have the power to clean a carpet.Sometimes the dirt falls back out when you are done. In my view, and my wifes for whom I bought it, ir is not worth the time or expense. Too bad."
1,junk,"i got this sweeper and paid 34.99 for it. got it home and charged the battery and started to use it and it flipped over all the time.it wasn't as easy as it looks on tv.even tring to move it from floor to carpet it flipped and the dirt tray scattered all over the place.i wouldn't buy another one for nothing and i learned my listen on this kind of sweeper,it is more work than help.after sweeping up all the dirt and dust many times,putting this in my give away box at my garage sale.it must took the people who advertise this sweeper alot of practice to make it look easy on tv."
1,junk,When the battery held a charge it worked well but that was only for the first couple weeks. I followed the instructions to the word. You can get a lot better sweeper for less money. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I used mine for two months now I wonder how it's doing in the local dump?
1,This is an awful product,This is the most stupid purchase I have ever made. It does not have any suction. It leaves ALL dirt on the floor. It is totally useless.
1,Haven't gotten my swivel sweeper yet,Haven't gotten my swivel sweeper yet. And it is really ghey.I have used the swivel sweeper before and it as a product is pretty freakin sweet. That is why I am dissapointed it hasn't come yet.
1,doesnt work.,"I have one of these at home and love it. Ordered one for work and was excited. Didn't work. Am trying to contact seller regarding issue, so my review might change. I do love the one at home and have had it for years so I am hoping this is a fluke and that this can be resolved. Right now I am very let down."
5,Pets? Swivel Sweeper a MUST,"I'm not one to write reviews but this really is a handly little sweeper. Mine was a gift for Mother's Day from one of my four children and it's the best gift I've ever gotten. We have 5 cats, a dog a parrot, all indoors and live in a 74 yr old house. Enuf said!! This Swivel picks up everything but men and money!!! It gets the dust bunnies where they stand; they don't wind up under a bed, behind a door or in another room. I can now sweep the stairs with a load of laundry under one arm and the Swivel in the other hand. It works equally well on wood floors, bathroom tile and rugs. I can run it thru the entire house on one battery charge ...but best of all, I now have time for things other than sweeping up!!"
3,"Great product, bum battery","I have had my swivel sweeper for about 4 months now and I love it. It does all it says it will do. My 7 year old son begged to do the sweeping for me! When the battery would no longer hold a charge, I called the customer service line and asked what to do. She told me that the battery is only designed to last six months. So, keep in mind when you are purchasing this item, you will spend $[...]+ $[...] s/h each six months on a new battery. Like I said, I love the swivel sweeper, but I'll be using my vacuum from now on which only sucks dirt, not my pocketbook!"
2,very light but very flimsy,"I have had my sweeper for several months and found it to be handy for cleaning up bird seed around my parrot cages. However, it does not suck up bird feathers.I liked it because it is light. However, the casing is flimsy and has broken. I plan to replace it with something more sturdy."
2,Broke down,"The sweeper worked very well on the wooden floors for awhile, then it broke down because of dust inside the rods that make the sweepers turn. I had cleaned the whole thing out twice but now it just doesn't turn at all anymore. I've tried everything except replace the drive motor."
2,"worked for a while, then ended up in the trash","it worked great for a while for crumbs, but never good for hair as it would tangle in the brissles, then I would spend 10 minutes detangling...but it did its job for the most part til the battery stopped recharging, which really only lasted maybe 6 months or less....so I knew it was not worth buying a new battery so the whole thing ended up in the trash. I would rather pay more for better quality and not fill the landfills with more stuff."
5,grunt caller,"Bought this for my lil' brother, he absolutely loves it! Drives his mom and dad crazy, trying to get it perfect. Great item!!"
5,Col. Parker,"This album is great if you like good Rock/Blues. Everything you'd expect from Gilbey Clarke and more. It is great rock with a definate blues sound to it. It's hard to find a album of this nature lately. I highly recomend it to anyone who likes a strong guitar, rock and blues."
5,Well written and researched,"When I went to Yellowsone N.P. and was researching the Archives there the librarian there said that they consider this book the most complete and accurate account of the history of the park. I liked it because it was well written and nicely illustrated, making it not just a good reference, but enjoyable to read as well. This park is truly a unique place and the first of a most wonderful concept. If you have any intrest in Yellowstone, or plan to travel there, this book will provide some rich history you should not miss."
4,"Fascinating in its detail, but sometimes dry.","This book isn't what I'd call a ""light read."" It's a hard-core history book packed with detail, verification of the detail, and even more detail. At times, this depth is fascinating. At others, it's a little dry. If you're looking for the facts mixed with some really great stories, you'll love this book."
2,disappointing,"The Melville text is fine. The notes are somewhat condescending. The major problem is with the selection of secondary and supportive literature. I bought this, expecting to read essays on Melville by Thomas Mann, Hannah Arendt, Robert Lowell, Camus, et al. What I found was one page selections from these authors (in the case of Mann, just a few sentences saying he wished he had written as well as Melville - how is that informative or valuable in any way?). Sorry to have to say it, but the editor, Cornell professor or not, is an idiot, apparently. Will try to return this and get the Library of America edition which at least gives you more Melville for your buck."
1,borrring,this book was extremely boring. Good story line though. Maybe Melville should have stopped after his bad review of M.D.Billy Budd has many symbolic meanings but just never could keep my interest. It was as if Melville tried to fit in too much symbolism and did not pay enough attention to the story itself.
4,A good but not great read,"I think my main problem wit this book is that I readNell Sweeney books first. The N.S. books were written 10years later. This is still a very good historical romance,even if there were quite a few historical inaccuracies. Itstill showed us the author did her research and workedhard. Some of the accuracy in this story reflects the violenceof the times. The violence is well used to move the storyand part of the character development of main peopleinvolved; but it still wouldn't be for tender sensibilities.This is a very serious book with very dramatic scenes. Ifyou love a good cry and tension this is a perfect book for you!"
4,Wonderfully different and absorbing.,I like it that this isn't another wimpy romance story. Both Martine and Thorne had to face several challenges which made them stronger and better people.
2,Not her best,"Though I read other books from this author, and loved them, I found this one to be very long and drawn out. The characters did not draw me in. I felt I could have fallen for Thorn if he would have just been a little more aggressive with his feelings. It was just too long. I was not fond of Martine at all. The story needed more heat between them. Hopefully the sequel will be better."
1,Could not finish,"I love historical novels, but this one was a bust. The story doesn't have a flow to it and it's a drag to read. Sorry but I am not buying any other books from this author."
5,DMB Does what they do best once again!,"If it is possible, this CD tops all of the DMB's previous albums! I think this is a good way to redeem themsevles from the terrible ""Everyday."" Dave brings back his old favorites for us to jam to one more time!"
4,Not bad live CD,"The new Dave Mathews CD is yet another live album produced by the former Virginians, and while I really enjoyed it, there are a couple of flaws in it that cased me to give it a four instead of five.First the good stuff. There are some really good live versions on this CD, my favorites include: Lie in our Graves, the Last stop, and the Maker. I have never heard The Maker, yet it is really catchy and I did enjoy it.Now onto the bad. It seemed as though Dave and the band were experimenting with this live CD. All along the Watchtower was good, but there last CD (NY) had a much more solid version. Also, as a personal oppinion, I love to hear the crowd interaction, and this one doesn't seem to have much on it (concerning when the crowd pops).Make no mistake, this album is a solid piece of business, so it definatly deserves four stars, but I personally think that there New York live album gets five."
4,Remake of Great Music,"I've been a huge DMB fan for a while and just purchased this cd on it's release date. You basically get 2 hours of pure Dave, which is always great. However, when I first heard of the release of a live cd way back when, I was hoping for an Everyday live. Instead, just think a blend of Red Rocks, with the adlibs of Listener Supported with electric guitar instead of piano breakdowns. Once again, the music is nothing less than impressive, but don't expect anything you haven't already heard."
5,MITCH RUTMAN'S GUITAR PLAYIN MAKES THE CD,MITCH RUTMAN MAKES THE MAKER.....HE IS SO DAMN TALENTED...I WISH DMB HAD HIM FULLTIME!!!
3,Not the best live Dave Matthews I've heard,"A decent album, but i am not too impressed with the tracks. Maybe I need more time to get used to it, but now I would buy his other live albums first. I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if I could have."
4,Good Live Set but only for Die Hard Fans,"Dave Matthews Band has always sounded better live and this recording is proof of this fact. The performances are tight and strong and the set is aumented by guest performances such as Victor Wooten bass player for Bela Fleck that bring new sounds and improvisations on well known songs.The only thing is that many of these songs are already covered on other live sets that have been released in the past. Casual fans may want to see other releases in order to decide which one fits their taste better. As for die hards fans, if you are willing to spend more dollars in live recordings this is another fine addition to your DMB collection."
2,Too many songs that I have heard before!,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Dave Matthews Band fan, it is just that I am getting the feeling that I have heard these songs played over and over on each CD. There are probably 20 songs that have been repeatedly put on CDs. There are a few riffs and adlibs that are different on each CD but I feel as though there arent enough songs of the group to be putting out another live CD. They truly have a lot of songs that would be nice to have on a live CD, like: I'll Back you up, Song that Jane Likes, Spoon, Crush, Dreaming Tree, Pay for What You Get, Let You Down. It does make sense because the fact that these songs are not played much at concerts, but the material being put on these CDs do not have that new feeling when you hear them anymore. This CD did really nothing new for me, with the exception the Maker, all are on other live CDs, Red Rocks was awesome, would recomend that for anyone over this!"
5,Another Great Album,"I am a big fan. This album was semi-traditional Dave but none the less, it is good. Worth the money if thats is a concern. Turn it up and it will inspire you."
4,Good but......,"The album is good. I am a big Dave Matthews fan but some things were definitely missing in this album. The Lovely Ladies' abscence on Stay made the song lose some of its electricity. Watchtower was kind of drawn out with no real energy in it. So Much into Too Much was awesome and so was Lie in Our Graves, my favorite song. I would have to say that this album is a little subpar as compared to Listener Supported or the best album ever, Live @ Red Rocks. It's still really awesome."
3,"Good concert, bad mix","I like this album...A LOT. I don't want anyone to think differently. But there is something wrong here. This album seems more canned than live at points and the mix leaves a lot to be disired. There are points when Dave's guitar and Boyd's violin are almost non-existant, while Leroi's sax is almost overwhelming. About halfway through the first disc, however, everything seems too get better (although not perfect...the violin is still a little distant.) I wish that I could get a hold of the master tapes and remix this one. If I could, I know this would be a 5 star album rather than a 3 star one. Until that happens, though...3 stars...sorry Dave....."
4,Another Live One,"Well, another live album very similar to Listener Supported. A few of the treats include The Maker, Christmas song, and Tim Reynolds on the electric guitar. The songs jam out for quite a while, but do it nicely. While its no Red Rocks, at least it was before he let his marketers sell him out with Everyday."
3,It was the Best of Tim..... It was the worst of Tim,"Okay this review I'm only gonna write about Tim bc theres about a million other reviews of the CD. So DisclaimerThis is my personal feeling about Tim. This CD has the best guitar solos on it so far for DMB. But Tim does this wicked annoying scratchy thing. Dave will be in solo part of a song and all you can hear from Tim is ( SKKREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH! SCRATCH!) It sounds good on Dont Drink the Water but that's about it. On a brighter note he has his best solo ever on Lie in Our graves. Xmas Song is cool too because its just Dave, Carter on brushes, and Tim playing a bluesy solo clean (YES NO DISTORTION!!!). Mitch Rutman and Victor Wooten jam for almost 6 minutes on the Maker, some awesome blues there. Victor's solo on #41 is good bc he sounds like he's making fun of the music almost.There are better DMB live CD's then this, Red Rocks, Listener Supported... But if you play guitar this is a good CD for you."
5,The best collection....,"If you've ever frequented a DMB concert, you know that is the only place you will find the real Dave, not on a CD, and bootlegs just don't have the quality. Live in Chicago hits as close to that mark as possible. For a long time Live at Red Rocks was my most played...but Chicago offers a change, and reveals some of those songs you only hear at a DMB concert. A collection of live music, their most popular, and most requested that have never seen a CD or gotten past the live stages. A definite buy!"
4,Dave Returns to his Roots,"For too long Dave Matthews has gotten away from his ""Jam Band"" roots. That is a shame because Dave and the boys are one of the best around today. If you were dissapointed by ""Everyday"" and ""Live at Red Rocks"" and you want a return to the days of extend jams and a wide mix of musical styles this album is for you. It is a good mix of old favorites and new soon-to-be classics. The most important thing about this album is that he gets away from the 3-4 minute pop songs that his new album and to a good extents his recent concerts are all about. In this album you will get to hear Dave do what he does best, jam and get the audience going. I would recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of Dave Matthews live shows, it really captures the band in their essence."
1,Over and Over again,"For anyone who calls Dmb a jam band well you are wrong. Over the summer i started trading and i stopped after about 2 months because the band seems to like playing the same old jams over and over again. I mean its not even funny anymore there is no variation or anything. I have to say that I do not lke this cd at all the songs are a ll standard DMB songs. They are all played out to the same tune that they always have been. THe best part of this cd is listening to victor Wooten of the Fleckotnes, this guy is amazing. If u want Jam i suggest u pick up the flecktones cd Live Art it is the best cd I own period."
4,Don't blast them for jammin'...,"Although I must say that this live CD is not their best, it is so much better than anything on Everyday. DMB is well-known for their long jams during their live shows. An earlier reviewer said he thought the songs were altogether too long but I must disagree. The songs are the perfect length to get the effect of what a DMB concert is all about. At least they aren't overproduced ""pop songs"" like on Everyday. I think this DMB CD is a good one to have. Not great by any means, but any true fan of the band will know that this lives up to the DMB's lofty expectations."
3,Buy Red Rocks instead!!!!!!,"This album is strikingly mediocre. The sound is too much, sometimes there is waaay to much going on. Prehaps this is due to the guest artists that appear on many of the songs. The band does preform well, and performs the ol' standby jams, as well as improvising a little bit. For the most part the compositions of the songs weren't that dissapiointing(except for the really short #40).I guess my main problem with this album is that the sound is so completly different from that of the Red Rocks live CD(The gold standard for ALL live CD's). Maybe it was the way that this CD was mixed that turns me off of this CD. It kind of sounds like they took the raw PA feed and slapped it onto a CD without bothering to re-EQ it.Don't let this be your first DMB live album, Red Rocks and Luther College are light years beyond it."
3,Curious Selection,"This release was curious in my opinion for a few reasons. First (and the reason for only three stars) is that Dave's vocals are average at best for this show. His voice is showing obvious strain and an earlier release from the year might have been a better choice. This live CD also comes after the release of Everyday which has sparked some controversy to say the least. I find it interesting that they issued a live CD with not a nod to either Everyday or anything from the Lillywhite sessions. If indeed they intend to ""endorse"" songs from the Lillywhite sessions as they have publicly stated, one would have thought that this would have been a golden opportunity to issue a live CD with some of those songs on it instead of releasing a CD that basically sports no new material that they haven't already put forth in a live commercial release. As always the music is enjoyable and worth the purchase, I just think they could have given us more."
3,"awful sonics, bland performance","this album isn't nearly as good as red rocks, listener supported, or live at luther college. the sonics are awful. just a muddy mess. live at luther college is so clean, you can hear every nuance of the music. this chicago recording doesn't even sound like them live. I think half of the album was redone in the studio. a big let down from the previous live material."
3,More of the Same,"As always, the Dave Matthews Band shines live. There are outstanding jams, great vocals, and a (very) enthusiastic crowd.Unfortunately, this CD is much more of the exact same. Put in ""Listener Supported"", and you'll be shocked by the similarities, other than the fact that ""LS"" has better audio quality. Same thing goes with ""Live at Luther College."" The bottom line is that unless you're an extremely active Dave Matthews fan, you don't need any more than 2 live CD's. After a while, they get very tiring.I love Dave Matthews and this is an outstanding CD, but the bottom line is that it's been done. While listening, I kept on asking myself ""Why another live CD? Does this make 5 now?"" If you really want to see DMB live *that* much, just do it. Don't waste your money buying yet another DMB Live CD - it's not worth the money."
2,Good and Bad news,"Good news -- This TV is very reasonably priced for the size. It could save much space in our kitchen. The under counter bracket has a much wider turning angle han some competitive units. Picture is bright and reception is good. Sound is adequate - better than some small units. The FM reciever is a great added bonus!Bad News -- Connected to an antenna instead of cable the UHF channels show the wrong channel number. Some TV's have a setting to correct this. The FM tuner doesn't search automatically or save channel settings. Thus, it is not convienent to use with more than one channel. These are both very minor shortcommings that can easily be ignored. Unfortunately, the TV emmits a very annoying high pitch noise that my 16 yr old son can easily hear. It is probably the horizontal scan mechanism radiating noise at 15,750 cycles per second. For this reason we are regretfully returning the TV."
2,"Good picture, but it died","This TV has a great picture and sound, but...Our unit also had the annoying hum and finallydied a month after the 90 day warranty ran out.No picture, no sound, nothing. Luckily, the storewe bought it from was nice enough to take itback.This TV was purchased for the kitchen, and itwould have been nice if the remote buttons werecovered or sealed like some of the other brands."
1,Did not like,"The audio for this TV did not sound unless the reception for the picture was perfect, for instance in a normal tv when there is only snow you hear something (snow sound) if the reception for this tv is less than perfect using the antenna and the picture is a little snowy the audio remains mute , really annoying when you can still see a picture but no audio, I brought it back"

1,DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I am very disappointed with these earrings. The color is NOTHING like the picture. These earrings are very dull and very , very dark (almost black). No blue at all that I can see. I have since read that this dark color is the least valuable color in sapphires. Not worth the money."
5,Don't just stop at lemons!,Try limes and oranges too! Nice thick handle helped me thru 5 Lemon/lime/orange cakes I made for a charity auction. Stayed sharp and nice long strands and short confetti styles were achieved making the cakes beautiful inside and out.
5,Train Puzzle,"I bought this for our 6th anniversary, (Iron and Candy). It's a really cool puzzle to build, and enough challenge without being too tough."
5,lights up the road,These work just as well as the 1100x I used to have but PIAA has discontinued. The drawback of the 1100x was the lens and lamp was a single unit and expensive to replace. This is better designed to allow you to just change the burned out bulb. The only criticsm of this is the body is made of plastic while the 1100x was a metal body. Wish PIAA would make a quality metal bodied small lamp.
3,Bright enough to help?,"Application: motorcycle. I have used PIAA 1100X on a bike. I THINK the 1100X is brighter, despite the H3's being a brighter bulb. On the plus side, H3 bulbs are more readily available. However, size is nice for tight application. Wiring diagram is good enough."
5,Danco Perfect Match is a Perfect Match!,"We used this product to clean up a hole in the wall which had allowed access directly to a drain pipe for a washer. The product has several punch outs which allowed us to use the product as a nice cover plate to clean up the look of the wall. We just cut the hole in the wall a little larger, punched out the hole we wanted to use in the outlet box and then fit the outlet box in the hole. Wammo perfect match! We could not find a similar product in any local supply stores and the price here on amazon could not be beaten!"
1,Complete junk.,"Comes with everything shown, but it's A LOT smaller than it looks. My daughter got some use out of it, but her disappointment was very plain. She spent her own money on this product and felt cheated."
1,not happy!,Toy was not the same as picture and not in same packaging. I wam not pleased with it. I may donate toy.
3,its just not that great,"Its not horrible but its not worth the 15.00 I paid for it.. cheaply made and just sort of boring, the only things my daughter has played with out of the whole bag is the bottle and sippy cup. Save your money and just buy those."
3,"Not the best, but decent for the money","This kit is cute, although I was certainly glad I had read the reviews because mine did not resemble the photo and did not even include all of the same items (no bottle warmer, for example - not an essential, but it is specifically mentioned in the description). In fact, some of the items I can't tell for sure what they are, and I was a little disappointed that some of the items didn't have the same features mentioned by other reviewers (i.e. no magic bottle, lotion pump doesn't push down, diaper is not velcro but a sticky material that I doubt will hold up to much long term use). It is also worth noting that the size/scale of the items is all over the place. As others commented, the potty is pretty small, but the diaper is for a larger doll/stuffed animal. The baby blocks are basically the same size as the milk container, etc. Still, mostly looks like fun and for the price I can't complain too much."
4,Stuff you receive varies from the pictures,"This is a cute little product for a three year old girl, with lots of things to play with. But there are a few things that don't exactly match from the pictures. I do not mind, because she does not mind or notice and has enjoyed playing with it!"
3,not even close to the picture,i bought this for my daughter mainly for the care product and baby potty. n when i recieved the item the potty was beyond small not even close to what they display and the diaper will never fit a doll. overall its a cute set i just think they should display a more accurate picture of what your really getting
3,Not as pictured,"I had noticed after I ordered this item, that the picture changed often. The items weren't the same, and they were different colors, etc. When I received my order, some of the items were the same ones pictured at the time I ordered it (from Target), but lots were different, some weren't included, some other ones were, and the colors were TOTALLY different. This is a cute set, but photo is not accurate. Also, the quality isn't that great. The bottles are cool because they do unscrew and open, and the shampoo bottle pumps. The potty I received was blue and much smaller looking with no sticker as pictured as I write this review. It's okay for the price, but beware; you probably won't get what's pictured."
3,Cheaply made but fun,"My daughter enjoyed playing with all these items for her doll, however the product is very cheaply made and so the products dont last very long. But i guess for the price it is perfect for a temporary toy."
1,horrible customer service,horrible customer service this was the first product I ordered and the last to arrive even though i placed other orders two and three days apart when contacting the seller they were ruse and out of line daughter liked the toy but it is not worth the hassle of dealing with this company ever again. also some of the items got broken within first use severely disappointed...
4,Merry Christmas,"Cute. The items could have been just a little bit larger. Hopefully, the Angel will enjoy receiving this. I did have fun shopping for these."
4,really cute,"My little sister loved it. Had all the things she wanted to ""take care of her baby"". Would recommend this."
2,Blood and Sex Nightmare,Not a whole lot to review on this movie as it had little to no plot but enough T&A where it needed to be. Thank You!
3,Mis-identified!,"If you order this item, know that the picture is incorrect. A WS6015 is pictured. Once used, even mis-pictured, the vender will not exchange.....understandable but disappointing."
4,Great Product,I have used this product for several years and it always works well at cleaning my tile floor as well as my laminated floor. It was reccomended by the perso who installed my floors.
5,Mohawk FloorCare Essentials Hardwood & Laminate Floor Cleaner,It's a VERY good product and the price is right!!! I highly reccomend it-- It makes your hardwood look GREAT!!!
4,Do Like Sister,"Anyone who has ever had a brother or sister (or raised a few) knows how much younger children like to copy their older siblings. ""Do Like Kyla"" is a comfortable tale of one day in the life of two sisters. The younger follows the older through each step of their routine, painting a warm picture of closeness. My daughter enjoyed the simple text and colorful pictures of ordinary family life."
2,Filled with bad grammar . . .,"This book was given to my son as a text book and I had to correct the grammar and incomplete sentences before I could let him read it. The title shoud be ""Copy Kyla"". The page that starts ""Got me some . . ."" should read ""I have . . ."" The pages are not numbered. Only two pages are free of grammatical errors. I gave one star for good illustrations and one star for the positive family life and small town atmosphere of the book."
5,Art of cycling - Wonderful Book,"I've never ridden a bike in a city, so I thought I'd do some reading on the matter first, then hop on my new bike. And I'm glad I did, this book is well written and extremely informative about the dangers of the road and the ways in which to limit those dangers.I highly recommend this book to everyone; people in cars, people on bikes. Everyone should read this book. Even people that walk everywhere!"
5,BUST A GUT,That's right. You've seen them on Sanford and Son. Redd Foxx's buddies from the chittlin' circuit. Wild Wild comedy. You will laugh whether you want to or not. True Kings of Comedy.
3,Window Lock,"got the items in reasonable time frame, not the ""best"" window lock but sure to deter someone from trying to slip the lock. Installed easily, one problem is they used aluminum screws, the heads wring out easily. But the locks work well and did the trick."
5,Perfect condition,I bought this linen calendar as a gift for someone and they loved it! It put a smile on their face!
2,Slip slidin' away....,"This corer's grip is slippery if your hands are wet. (How often does this happen when you're working in the kitchen?) Also, because of its thin handle, turning the tool is not as easy as it should be."
4,Can it Core an Apple?,"Yes it can, with ease. Very handy little tool to have especially in this season of pies. It works very nicely and I would recommend Kitchen Aid products to anyone."
3,Cute but not what I expected...,"If you're just starting out crafting or you are looking for projects to do with children then this would be a great book for you. The ideas are well explained and very simple, there are tons of pictures (both in black & white and in colour), the patterns are all full-sized, but it wouldn't be too exciting or different for an advanced craftsperson looking for a challenging project."
5,"1001 Full-Size Patterns, Projects & Ideas","Thank you, excellent new product; fast and efficient service. Very pleased and highly recommend."
1,Beware Philips products - defective and difficult to repair,"Failed to write, lost memory, damaged CDs, ruined over many blank CDs from various manufacturers by failing in mid recording. EVERY Philips CD recorder we tried is junk! And forget their customer care even if you purchase their pricey coverage plan (which you will need if you buy their machines). The positive reviews appear to be people who were the fortunate few. Sadly Philips, which was one of the inventors of the CD technology, has failed to keep up their reputation in the CD recorder market. Buyer beware!"
5,Works great,"Good fit, well machined. I used the 1 1/8 setting. Wish I bought this 10 years ago instead of having to go to the shop."
5,Pedro's Star Nut Setter,This is a great product. It's very heavy duty and should last a lifetime. It made the process of setting the star nut square and perfectly deep that I wonder how I did without it.
4,Outstanding Kirk Douglas Movie,"Detective Story, based on a Broadway play, is one of Kirk Douglas' finest performances. Playing a New York city police detective, the movie plays out like a day-in-the life of Douglas' character and his precinct, with an assorted cast of characters.But Douglas dominates the proceedings. His detective is full of razor-sharp anger and vitriol, which has carried over into his personal life. Douglas plays it to the hilt,and his supporting cast is excellent, including Eleanor Parker, William Bendix, Joseph Wiseman, and Horace McMahon.A mixture of police procedure, comedy, drama, and outright tragedy, Detective Story has been long overdue for DVD release."
3,I loved this until 3/31/12,I saw Napoleon at the Paramount Theater in Oakland live with Carmine Coppola and the Oakland Symphony. I owned this VHS since it was a wonderful ghost of the Paramount performance. I lost this tape in my divorce. I can recommend this performance until the current restored version receives enough funds to add the new five and a half hour Carl Davies soundtrack. I truly hope that Mr. Brownlow and his partner consider Kickstart to finish that endeavor. The two friends I took to the latest perform could not say enough about how much they enjoyed Abel Gance's vision of Napoleon.I cannot say enough about this film.
5,Manifique!,"Upon seeing the restored and re-released film in 1981, I placed this silent at the top of my list of favorite foreign films from the silent era. The use of triptych, color, and daring camera angles is breathtaking! Gance was one of film's innovative pioneering geniuses. Although at times the acting is a bit stilted, the viewer must remember that these actors are turn-of-the-century schooled; today's acting style is far different and more relaxed. The electricity sparks between Napoleon and Josephine. Finally, Coppola's score is unforgettable, haunting, and touching. This film is one to add to your film collection!"
3,Gance's overblown masterpiece is available on DVD...,"This is not so much a review as a notice that the ""Zoetrope"" version of ""Napoleon"" is available on DVD from Australia (I got my copy from EzyDVD). You should be able to get it for under $25. The DVD is Region 4, so you will need a multi-region DVD player, but it plays fine. I presume it is identical to this VHS version. I'm not a huge fan of this film (hence the three stars and the inevitable slating I'll receive), but it nevertheless deserves a worldwide DVD release so people can make up their own minds."
5,Great item,We got this for a road trip. It was in good condition with no scratches. You could not beat the price. I would recommend it.
3,mozart the great,"OK, now this was a pretty good film. I enjoyed it much and continue to as I watch it frequently. It is a definate ""must have"" for any mozart fan. The reason I rated it a 3 is because it is in black and white, otherwise I would have given it a 4. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
2,Bad Sound,"The picture was great, the remote was was ok to use, the hook-up was ok, but the sound was real bad. We could not hear the voices for the back ground noise. It was not worth keeping. On some of the programs the sound system was wonderful, but with talking it made it terrible to try to hear what they were saying. So we took it back to where we bought it for our refund."
2,Big disappointment,"This product looked good on paper. The unit received isn't. The problems are two: the flat screen produces a great deal of glare. Second problem is the remote. The overall size is large, but the buttons are much too small. Further, the button placement is illogical. We have to fetch our glasses to ""read"" the buttons. Worse is the response time from the remote to station change.Always slow, often not correct. Had we seen this in action in an electronics store, we'd never even consider it. This is a kitchen-located set now; soon it will be relegated to a seldom-used guest room. A disappointment."
1,Horrible unit,"Purchased this item but was the worse TV I have ever had. It was EXTREMELLY heary and almost immediatly, the on/off switch gave me problems, it turn off and on, which required toying with it for at least 20 minutes, turing it off and on, until it would finally stay on. Just gave it away to Goodwill, hope they can replace switch. Got very tired of it."
2,Not what I expected.,"I love to read, but I need a book that captures my attention. This book did not pay keep my attention."
5,If you have a prodigal,"This book is very encouraging. It includes the stories of famous prodigals who came back to God and significantly impacted our world.(St. Augustine, etc.). I highly recommend this book. It's an easy read, and packed full of hope."
5,REAL LIFE PRODIGALS,"I HAVE PERSONALLY DEALT WITH A PRODIGAL IN MY FAMILY. THIS WAS A FABULOUS BOOK FOR ME TO READ AND PRAY FOR THAT PRODIGAL! RUTH GRAHAM BEARS HER SOLE IN THIS BOOK, AND LOOK WHAT GOD DID IN HER SONS LIFE!!! WELL WRITTEN AND AND EASY READ! I CONSIDER IT A MUST READ FOR ANY FAMILY GOING THROUGH TOUGH TIMES WITH A FAMILY PRODIGAL."
2,Didnt do it for me,Lots of better books out there for poker and gambling readers. Book was just too bland and uninteresting for me.
5,On my LIST!,This book helped me incredibly understand the odds and help beat the casino at their games. I recommend it.
4,Wrecked By Lions wa one of the most ignored records of 1997.,"On their second and best full-length effort to date, Number One Cup throw off their low-fi label and surrender to rock's temptations. Many have flung the ""sounds like Pavement"" phrase at this band since the first critic did so, parroting (and unfortunately perpetuating) an inaccuracy. This record rocks long, loud, and illogically (which is good)."
3,both historical and practical approach,"Provides good overview on the historical and theological development of Baptist churches in the first 3 chapters and the eigth chapter (which specifically deals with Baptism and Communion). Chapters 4-7 describe the traditional views of Baptist organization. These chapters may be very useful for newly established congregations. For congregational leaders of older churches looking for new ways to organize ministry, these chapters are helpful for an understanding of past processes. The last 3 chapters describe how congregations may fit into larger structures of the church on earth."
3,A Baptist Manual of Polity and Practice,"This books covers most things Baptist. It has a great deal of historical information. My only disappointment is that it seems to be somewhat dated. However, knowing where we have come from is essential if we want to understand where we are going."
1,Makes a really good paper weight,"At first, the thing was just having problems as a router. The DHCP gave out so I had all my machines on a static ip. No biggie. But, it was just the first sign of trouble. Then occassional I could not connect to it with ethernet although USB still worked. Then the sync up with the DSL started to fail for long periods of time. Then it gave out altogether.I had this thing for three months. Zoom tech support was unhelpful and unresponsive.I had to go out and spend another $90 on an actiontec which I hope will be better.Don't buy this modem. Its a waste of money and time."
1,vol. 3-I sustain the wings,"It seems that the magic lable is afraid to try to improve the quality of the sound of it's CD's. Perhaps they think that if the music on it's albums should not sound to good, then perhaps their customers would think that perhaps they had bought a Jazz Band CD by mistake. After listinging to Jazz Band CD's of the Glenn Miller Army Air Force Orchestra (the word band does not describe the the sound of this Fantastic Agragation.)I now know that theese great recordings do not have to sound like there is a bowl of rice crispies next to the microphone.If I want rice crispies I'll buy a box of them. On the Jazz Band Cd's there is seldom if ever any grove noise. How they do thatI do not know, nice trick. Stick with the four Jazz Band albums of complete broadcasts. Buy them your ears will smile."
2,For Young People,Ok! for young people! Being married for years this book doesen;t offer what I was looling for in staying in a relationship!!
3,Needs Work,"This is a quick, easy read that has some enlightening assessments of behavior but leaves out a lot. There are way more categories that people fit into and often overlap. That is why we are so complex and hard to figure out. I also feel is a bit unfair to focus on men as being the only sex to have these behavioral issues, when most of the behavioral issues are non gender."
4,Love the book!,I love the book. It is witty and easy to read along with. Not boring and helpful in so many ways. It allows you to realize that deal breakers are okay and not shallow as long as they aren't petty. I repeatedly go back to the book for reference or just to laugh.
4,Pretty Good,"Waited way too long to read this book. Had I read it awhile back, I do believe I could have saved myself much heartache."
4,good,"good. you need this book in order to work on your confusion and you know, just move on in generals."
4,"Beautiful and fun, wholesome, huge hardcover comic book!",My kids and I really enjoyed reading this book. My 6 year old daughter likes to have it read to her and she likes looking at the pictures and trying to read a few words. Good prevails over evil and it is decent throughout. The artwork is really nice too. The story portrays a happy marriage and family and friends with good values and lots of love and loyalty for one another. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the ending was disappointing. I hope there will be a sequel that picks up where it left off and fulfills the readers hopes for the Courageous Princess! Thanks to the author for a really sweet book! Now about that sequel....?
1,"Amazing Book, Poor Binding","My eight-year-old daughter is crazy about this book, and rightly so. It's a princess story... an unlikely hero story... but it's so original, the voice and illustrations so unique that it's completely unexpected and marvelous.The problem with this book? The paperback version printed by Dark Horse has a ridiculously bad binding. I ordered my daughter a new copy and it fell apart (as in the first 20 pages dropped out) the first day she had it. Lame!"
5,Statview 5.0,As ordered this software can in very quickly from the vendor. The software was new and in the original box and in an unopened security envelope. The box was unopened and contained the original manuals and documentation. I could not be more satisfied with the purchase or vendor.
5,"A shot in the dark, but a bulls-eye at that.","Bam! MTV Lounge Vol 3 the ultimate in lounge, chill, downbeat, latin, and deepswing. Well with a promotion like that how could I not get it. That's what I was thinking on my recent European vacation so I picked it up. But the quality of the music overwhelmed me at first listen. Most people like to relax to Dave Matthews or some other acuistic guitar rooted band in the states, to relax with friends. They don't know what they're missing. All three discs are amazing. After a thorough listening you feel refreshed and ready to face the world, and that can never be bad. So sit back relax and give your mind a little taste of trepidation through the illest grooves from across the pond."
3,Oceans 11 & 12,Just OK. Pretty weak but most movies are in this category. If you like most movies you will probably enjoy this but if you find most to be just marginal you will find this to be the same.
5,The music on sunny sunday,"On sunny sunday, I always listen to this album. This musician, sunny day service, is the best choise for sunny sunday morning. Because the music is peaceful and so comfortable.Hearing this album, I think you can relax."
1,Great Subject..poorly done,"I was excited when I heard about this film..I am a big Bettie fan. As a rule I buy anything Bettie but had I seen this film before I bought it..I would not have. The acting is stilted and really like a bad high school play, and the lead actress Paige Richards reminds me at times of Julia Sweeney. (IT's PAT!) ha haIf you are like me and buy anything Bettie, buy and enjoy, but if you are looking for a great bio film on Bettie..this ain't it."
2,Disappointing. Get The Notorious Betty Page instead.,"This is simply a refilming of the old 1950's Betty Page fetish loops - in black and white. No nudity. Why not just watch the originals?The only worthwhile thing on this disk is the old Bunny Yeager film on How to Pose Nude, and the original Paige Richards material. Paige is much prettier than the original Betty Page.I recommend The Notorious Betty Page with Gretchen Mol instead."
1,"Zero Stars, zero value",This is a complete rip off for any fan of Bettie photos or Bettie history. Everything about this DVD is either bad or fake. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Meh,"Well written, but rather sad characters. Although I finished reading it was a slow read and rather as depressing as the characters themselves."
2,supremely disappointing,"While Anita Brookner is very adept at character analysis, I found the book and the characters to be quite dull. As to the mystery of the story...yawn...Was supremely disappointed with the end..."
4,Lady in Light Construction,"I use my staple gun 4-5 times per year. Mostly for DYI projects around the house. I threw out my last two staple guns because they jammed every other staple. This one doesn't jam and I like it. Being a female, my hand strength isn't all that great. Would have like this gun to take less strength to use and the trigger to be closer to the gun. It's obviously designed for a man's hand and strength. Would be nice if some company would make a study, easy to use, non-jamming staple gun designed for women. There are lots of us out there who buy it."
2,NOT as advertised,"This was nowhere near as cool as it seemed like it would be. Granted, it says it's for 10-year-olds and up, but I teach kids that age and they would find it tedious. My 6-year-old thought it was cool, but I had to do all the work and it was quite a bit trickier than I would have expected. It was a two-part process requiring at least 6 hours between the parts, which meant timing it in a way that did not lend itself to my son's impatience or schedule. We had to be very careful to avoid staining the kitchen counter, which made me wonder about pouring out the liquid into the drain (what is IN this stuff?) The colors were not nearly as bright as advertised, many of the rocks broke during the process, and the whole front of the base lifted so it was partially floating by the second day. Furthermore, there is no explanation at all of what crystals are or how they form. I am unimpressed."
1,Disappointed,Fell below expectations...twice! You're instructed to not let the rocks touch the sides or each other. We did and they expand and gravitate to the small tank sides ending up in a big mess. It grew attaching itself to the walls distorting the view. Their satisfaction guarantee cost cash to replace. Over all disappointed.
2,magic rocks disappointed,"Although the magic rocks did grow and we have no complaint with the set per se, our rocks spread all over the wall of the container and we were unable to see the rocks that looked nice and clean in the center.I tried to scrape the growth off the walls of the dish and all it did was crumble and fill the water with crumbles. By the time we were finished our set was just a messy glob of the magic rocks with only one or two nice rocks that happened to survive.I'm not sure, maybe we put too many rocks in the dish. ??? Regardless, ours didn't turn out very pretty in the end. Would like to try again...I can tell it does work, but I think it needs a larger container."
2,Barely OK,"I agree that this toy was just ok. I followed the directions and the rocks grew some small spikes, but they began to break off when you pour off the solution and replace it with water. After a few days, the watery mess began to turn gooey and now it looks like a sloppy, gooey mess with a few short spikes out the top. It's also a lot smaller than I thought it would be--so check the measurements so that it fulfills your expectations. This is not what I remember from my childhood, but it was an ok experience. Not sure I would buy it again in any form."
1,Huge Disappointment!,"This album was such a huge disappointment to me. From some compilation somewhere, I have a version of the MMQ doing Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, and it is simply AMAZING. It's lively, and one of my favorite classic renditions. I was really hoping for more of that style with this album.Unfortunately for my taste, this album was surprisingly more sombre, however: minor keys, really sleeping selections. Perhaps the choices on the album are pieces written specifically for mandolin and meant to showcase their musical talent on a level that their peers and true afficiandos will appreciate? To this layman, it just sounds dischordant to me, and a jumble. I rated most tracks with 1 star out of 5, and nothing on this album rated higher than 3 for me."
5,So easy,I love this zester. I used to use a grater to get my fresh lemon zest. That was a pain. This is easy.
5,Nice Towel,"I ordered this for the towel, I have it attached to my golf bag and it works great. It is bigger and of better quality than I expected and the logo is well adhered.Overall, great for Bosox fans."
5,Fox cut out in MN at these episodes,"Apparently ratings were horrible and Fox dropped Escaflowne just as it got to these episodes.After watching this disc their decision seems very very wrong. If the first 8 episodes weren't good enough, these 3 are among the finest I've seen.Even if the mass market won't accept Escaflowne, every anime lover should own this series."
2,Very Disappointing...,"This book was a major disappointment to me. It was recommended to me by a friend who obviously does not have the same taste in books that I do. The beginning of the book was filled with rubbish. The sex scenes were borderline pornographic and the use of her ""colorful"" language leaves a lot to be desired. The only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead the 1 it actually deserves is because I feel this author has talent if only she would write the intimate portions of her book with a little more class. She can learn a lot from LaVyrle Spencer. She writes with class!"
4,A passionate romance that ends abruptly but isn't forgotten.,"I too found this title through Amazon.com. I can't begin to express just how much I enjoyed this book. The passion between Jenny and Will was so real I almost found myself jealous at times. If you haven't read this one yet I suggest you order it right away and make time, no matter how busy your schedule is, to read it. You won't be sorry!"
5,a great book,this book was excellent! Thanks Amazon.com for recommending this book! I want a Somebody's Baby part 2 -I would love to know how the author would have these characters continue on.....
2,Could have been better...,"At the beginning of ""Somebody's Baby"" I was intrigued by this story. I loved getting to know Jenny Jaffe and Will. But after the initial chapter, I felt that the book fell short. I would have loved to hear more about Jenny after she returned home. I liked the ""evil"" mother plotline, and wanted to know more about Jenny's life in New York. I found the character of Claudia to be boring and way too much time was spent on her wishy washy ""Should I find my parents or not"" part of the story. This novel would have been more enjoyable for me if it went in chronological order rather than skipping back and forth between the past and the present, and stayed with Jenny's point of view throughout."
3,"Falls short of being a great, enticing read","After reading some reviews for this book on Amazon, I was thrilled to be able to read it myself. However, the novel really fell short after the first chapter. Kagan really drew me in with her young love...however, Claudia, their love child, was extremely dull and seemed to be a woman lacking any real intiative and inner strength, it was hard for me to read about her, she bored me to tears. I thought the relationship with her husband was lacking and her daughter annoyed me immensely. Overall, I could say that was Kagan's fault, those characters were not appealing at all. However, the true story line was romantic and would have kept the story going if Kagan focused on it the entire time. I dont want to sacre readers away with the boredom of the Claudia chapter, it was a good book, however, I felt that there were some annoyingly cutesy and stupid cliches. It was fun and touching yet cheesy and somewhat over and under developed in different areas."
4,Heartbreaking.,"As an adopted child who has ""always wondered"", I was very moved by this well written, thought provoking book. It was easy to identify with Jenny, and how painful it must have been to give a baby up for adoption, even though in my case, I was the one given away. The author has a real knack for putting you there, right back into the midst of small town 1960. I found it interesting that the narrative began in first person but later switched to third person, without missing a beat. I recommend this book to anyone who was adopted, to get a look at the other side. Would I recommend it to anyone who has given a baby up? Yes, if you have the heart for it."
5,Wish there was more,"This series was so fantastic the animation was amazing. At a time when most computer animated shows were using strand rendered hair (which looked horrible) Action Man used more of a sculpted look, which made for great looking designs. If I remember correctly this show came out around the same time as Transformers Beast Machines (which also had great art direction) I hope some day the whole series will be released!"
1,Could Have Been A Good Book,"However.............this book lets itself down in many way. Being an encyclopedia you'd think it would be perfectly proofed. Not so!!! There are so many grammatical errors, it's not funny. I thought at the beginning it was just a typing error, but once I had gone past 50 pages there were (1) mispelt words, (2) gaps in sentences, (3) bad formatting, (4) images that did not correspond with the text beside it, (5) sentences with words missing.In no way would I recommend anyone buy this book until it has been reprinted with a proper proofing."
1,Do not buy this,What a crock! This was suspenseful enough but looked like something that was a TV episode plus it appears that it was cut at the ending so there was on clear resolution
5,As beautiful a journey as the beauty of Tuscany,"Rose Marie Curteman's My Renaissance: A Widow's Healing Pilgrimage to Tuscany is as beautiful as the journey on which beauty was her guide. I haven't read many books all the way through lately and I did hers. Even when one knows the outcome, one wants to keep reading. She told the story with such gentle depth with just the right touch of humor. We know as we read that even in grief, we will laugh again. Great characterization and wonderful pacing. Well done, well done. I hope it sells tons. I mean to buy a few copies as gifts."
3,Low Quality Production,"I do a lot of Bellydance workouts for fitness. This video has extremely low production values...bare set, bad sound. The instructor tries too hard to be cute and breathlessly sexy and there's a segment at the end where she brings in a friend to demonstrate...what exactly, I'm not sure. On the plus side, if you do the 20 minute or so workout you will feel a little sroeness and maybe get your heart rate up a little."
1,Almost the worst BD DVD ever,"I have only seen one other bellydancer who was worse than these two (dancer and assistant), and that was Janine Rabbit (wife of Eddie Rabbit). Don't waste your time one this DVD. The instructor had no idea what she was doing. She called omis yummies, he posture was off and her technique was slobby. Don't get me started on her assistant! Buy a different DVD, Jillina, Neon, Asyua, Neena/Veena, to name a few."
2,Absolutely worthless on Shiba Inu,"My Shiba Inu's undercoat is in dire need of a good brush (lost the last good rake we had). I saw the glowing reviews and low price tag on this one, so I thought I'd give it a try. I followed the directions, tried not following the directions, and in the end, I got just a few strands (literally between 0 and 3) of hair for each long stroke. If I just pinch the dogs coat and pull, I get a lot more undercoat.As far as the build quality goes, however, it is clearly a well made rake...a big surprise for the price. That is the only thing that keeps this review from being 1 star. Even if it didn't do the job for me, the build quality is quite good and worth a star in itself, even though it didn't work one bit for my dog.This might be a good rake for some breeds, but it's a waste of money on a Shiba Inu."
4,Shouldn't be matched w/ Amazon.... Total cost TOO HIGH,"The product is not the problem...The shipping and additional charge are the problem because of the supplier.I was @ petCo last night and priced this product. However, I had a gift certificate w/ Amozon. I came home and ordered through Amozon.I was quite surprised at the final charge.. after it was posted on my invoice...but I let it go through. ( gift certificate - not my real money) However,I will buy never 3ed party vendor again !Something (a product)costing $17.00 bucks ""out the door"" at a retail store ended up costing me $ 23.78 plus a delivery wait time.Stupid Me.....Don't make the same mistake. :-)"
5,amazing!!,"I have a 17 week old husky and he likes to loose his coat. And with the weather getting warmer, I know he will be shedding like a mad dog....hehe....this rake is phenomenal. After just 2 minutes of brushing you could see all the hair being picked up from his under coat. What a great investment. ^_^Thanks amazon!!Erik"
3,Old fashioned murder?!,"One of the reviewers of the novel said that it was ""One of those old-fashioned mysteries."" Well, that is true enough. When was this book written -- in the '80s? It's as if the author pulled an unfinished manuscript off the shelf and touched it up. A medical doctor without a cell phone? A medical doctor who rushes in to the scene of a murder and moves the victim? It's almost as if he has no common sense. I did like the information about the music boxes but found it rather strange how many people knew each other, particularly the ones in London. Oh, well, it is make-believe. I enjoyed the interaction between Sarah and Thomas. Not a bad novel, just could be better."
2,Directions confusing,"I can't figure out which side of the tape is the fiberglass side and which is the ""smooth"" side."
1,Not worth the money!,"I have a 1-megapixel $150 digital camera I bought for myself to carry around in my purse a few years ago, and I wish I'd just gotten the same thing for my daughter instead of this piece of junk. The flash is way too ""hot,"" the picture quality is terrible, and the thing is ridiculously delicate! I can't believe it's marketed toward kids. Drop it the least little bit and the spring that keeps the batteries against the electrical contacts breaks. This has happened twice to us in the first six months! My ""real"" camera is much more sturdy."
4,An inspiring book,"Sean's story is impressive and inspiring. Although the prose is basic, it is his story that is compelling. You need not be a cancer survivor to be moved by this book - his journey is well worth the investment of your time and worthy of your attention."
2,Not the Best on the Shelf,"Inspiring story...yes. Well written book...not so much.While I was moved and inspired by the author's accomplishments, I couldn't get past what seemed like a junior high school autobiography.The writing is weak and the tone simplistic. The story suffers for lack of strong literary skills."
3,Inspirational but...,"What an amazing story of sheer determination and beating the odds. Sean Swarner is a tough and focused individual without a doubt. At the same time I found the author to be a little on the unlikeable side. Aside from personality, anybody that knows first hand or has even read something as simple as ""Into Thin Air"" knows that at the time his approach to Everest was both reckless and egoistic. What he lacked in experience he tried to make up for with physical prowess and by sheer luck he didn't face any truly adverse conditions. While inspiring in many ways, hopefully this book doesn't inspire anyone with grandiose visions and a fat wallet to follow in his footsteps."
1,HOPE you don't have a problem,"if it were possible, I would give it zero stars. Auto configure DOES NOT WORK. Plan on it taking about 30 mminutes to self set up if you already have your pertinent info (VCI, VPI, and Encapsulation). I have to restart my computer and reflash modem every time my computer goes to sleep to make the modem work.Tech support is terrible. No one is ever there. Their hours are 9:00am - 9:00pm EST. I work 7am-7pm (CST) mon thru friday. I get home about 7:25 pm. That means if there is a problem, I have 35 minutes to try to get a hold of someone. If I am paying for the call (that's right it is NOT 1-800) and I paid good money for the product, My modem's company should not dictate when I have to get a hold of them. I have a family. I want to spend time with them. I should be able to deal with my modem on my time. I bought this modem 48 hours ago and plan on returning it. SOMEBODY IN INDIA IS BETTER THAN NOBODY."
3,"VERY,VERY,Fragile...but nice.","Bought two sets, both were damaged one worse than other, Amazon replaced very quickly...replacements were O.K., minor breakage at rim but easily glued...They look Great and Very Colorful...but again be careful when handling, and storage, after the Holiday's, would recommend separate storage..."
3,Music History,This was a very informative cd. It covered all the periods of the creation of music. From Baroque to Contempory. It had a breif discription on each of the time periods as well as a breif discription on some of the major composers. This program loaded easily onto the computer but it was not very easy to go from composer to composer. Either it loaded incorrectly into my computer or it was bad programming but I had to shut down the program each time I wanted to go to a different composers information. I did not have to do this for the history blurbs though. Very informative but very frustrating.
5,Interesting way of going through the past.,I enjoyed the book but was a bit confused about the time line of events. Made me concentrate more than I was able at times.
3,Disappointed,"I finished reading this book about a week ago and the fact that I remember little of it is very disappointing. I was especially disappointed with the ending. I felt it was a poor solution to a difficult situation. Oh well, I'll know better than to pay much for another offering from this author."
3,Way too much going on,"Some times less is more, and this book needed a good editing. I really enjoy this series, but it is not a good sign when there are so many characters that the reader starts to lose track of them & has to diagram the entire plot to make any sense of it. And at the end, a huge piece of the puzzle is missing...or at least I missed it!"
3,"Good glasses, wish they came with grey lenses instead of brown","I used to own revive model before and they were little bit smooth and comfortable than these. They are still good glasses in the price. I do not like the brown lenses, wish they had come with grey lenses. Orange lenses are good for enhance visibility, specially for outdoor sports. Replacing lenses in the frame is very easy once you get used to."
1,Crappy Design,The temples are so thin and flimsy that a simple toss of the glasses into the car broke one of them. Stick with the established brands.
2,"Soft, but too big!","I bought these sheets because the other reviews sounded good. However, after receiving the sheets and washing them, while very soft, they are much too big and baggy for my normal sized queen mattress. I don't have a pillow top, but it's also not a flimsy little mattress either. It really bothers us when the sheets are slack on the bed after one night. It seems all the sheets nowadays are made for very deep mattresses. Ours is 12"" deep...Very average. We are not happy with these sheets."
2,Didn't finish reading.,I was excited about this book and the author's travels but his writing just didn't do it for me. I was bored and didn't finish reading it.
2,:(,I received this item quick. The dvd is clear. The only thing i didn't like is that both of the movies are on the same dvd.
5,Great action,These movies are great. I got them cheap. I bought them at Walmart for 5 bucks! For sure good movies.
5,Rush Hour/Rush Hour 2,"THESE MOVIES ARE EXCELLENT, VERY FUNNY MOVIES,I BOUGHT RUSH HOUR 3, AND HAD TO HAVE 1 AND 2. EXCELLENT CHOICE! THEY ARE A MUST HAVE!!!"
5,Great music to forget your troubles,"I like this cd, I got it at [local store] and before that, I was dying to get it, it has some very nice songs on here and great artists. Chicago (I love this band's music)-baby, what a big surprise and Benny marodnes masterpiece, ""Into the night"" ...another one is escape (the pina colada song)by Rupert Holmes. I totally recommand this cd."
5,Another gem I found here at Amazon.,"This album is a great add on to the music I love; I didn't know I was such a Michael McDonald fan but he is in a lot of these songs, learned something new about myself."
3,Looks good once it's on,"Once installed the Tonneau is very nice looking and seems like it will last. The instructions that come with it aren't worth the paper they're printed on though.The good:- Looks good when done- Lightweight- Appears that it will hold up wellThe bad:- Can't remove Tonneau cover from the frame once on the truck- On my RAM 1500, this should really be about 1"" longer. It barely covers the tailgate- The cross braces aren't secured to the frame. I haven't tried to remove the cover assembled but my guess is that the bars will fall out. This can be resolved by drilling a hole and bolting them in place if the time comesFor the price I'm satisfied. It will come down to customer service. This is supposed to have a Lifetime Warranty just like the Extang covers do. Hopefully when I need them, they're there just like Extang has been for others who I know."
5,Lund 98064 Genesis Hinged Latching Tonneau Cover,"I purchased several different kinds of pickup bed covers over the past few years. This is by far the easiest to install; I put it on and was ready to roll in about 30 minutes! Easy to maintain and good looking. If you're looking for a stylish, well made cover, this is it!"
3,Richy Band,"Ive been a Poco Fan since the begining have always loved all the stuff but the current band is my favorite Running Horses is great Although Ive been a fan of Richy fury for years I think the band would be better off with out him. the intros dont even mention Jack Sundrud Bass player and great in his own right why not do a real dvd of the current Poco Band I think they can stand on thier own.BTW Richy wasnt in the band for ""crazy love"" Lets move forward"
1,Disappointed,There were only four songs that were exactly like the ones that were made popular in the 50's. The rest of them were not by the original artists or I had never heard of them. Don't waste your money.
1,No Customer Support,"Toast is a good program for burning CDs, but if you can't do it all yourself, watch out. The Adaptec customer service is terrible. Not only do they not have a toll free number, but I've been on hold over an hour and had no response. If you're a computer genius, enjoy. But if you'll have questions, it looks like you're on your own."
1,A NO NO!,"This is an old radio show (""Camel Caravan"") and though it may have some historical value, it is of NO value if you are a fan of the Sauter-Finegan Band. This CD is a variety radio show with the band mostly backing up other performers. This CD is also not indicative of the fine recordings that were made during that time period. It has ""amateur"" stamped all over it.As one who saw the band ""in person"" at the Hollywood Palladium, I find this CD a major disappointment as well as being misrepresented in it's presentation. One of the very few times I have felt a product misrepresented on Amazon.xom."
2,Sauter-Finegan That's All,"If you want the music of Sauter-Finegan, I recommend their 2 CD set titled ""Inside the Sound.""This CD uses them basically as a backup band for Vaughn Monroe, Dick Haymes etc."
5,alternator belt,"This belt came in on time, is very high quality and provides a good after market fit for a racing application."
5,Excellent! Easy to Read and fast paced!,"This is THE book to get if you want to learn good, fundamental, ASP. Although this book isnt as thorough as the Wrox book, its a much faster read, focusing on ASP fundamentals. The author gets repetitive at times, but i believe this is by design so as to drive home all the major concepts. Repetition is good, especially for the novice. I've already started developing a couple database-driven web applications at work thanks to this book. I recommend this book for beginners and then maybe moving on to the Wrox books for more detailed reading."
4,"Excellent, only lacking DHTML reference","Excellent book that clearly explains the basics of ASP using VBScript. In fact its more like a ""Teach Yourself VBScript with ASP 3.0"" book. However, alot of client side scripting requires knowledge not only of HTML but also DHTML which is not covered at all. It would have been nice to have included this vital topic as a reference in an appendix . Therefore, I would recommend buying along with this book something on DHTML as well."
5,I wish all web development books were as good!,"I have collected a small library of web development books and I can simply say that ""Sams Teach Yourself ASP 3.0 in 21 Days"" is one of the best books I have read. I hope the same authors of this book will come out with an ""ASP+"" edition. Many publishers have a lot to learn from this book."
2,I didn't like it,"A typical ""gotta write a lot of pages to get more pay"" book. The authors spends page after page saying the same things and explaining at length the obvious parts of their examples. Yet, even though they are so talkative they repeatedly fail to explain what they do when they introduce something NEW. Seriously, you want the new elemtns explained, not the old ones, don't you?I'm an experiecned web developer but haven't worked sith VB Script or ASP before. If you are like me and want to learn ASP quickly from a programming background, you'll find the book tedious and ineffective. Maybe it is good for complete beginners who haven't ever programmed anything at all,but I doubt it."
1,What a Disappointment,I bought this book believing that it would help me build better web pages but how disappointed I was to find that the coding that is provided within the text to demonstrate what is being described does not work!!!From the outset even just using the Option Explicit code generated an error.If you are new to ASP be carefull this could destroy any attempt at further learning
5,Very Informative and Readable,I found this book to be very helpful in learning the basics of ASP. The information seemed to be thorough enough and was written in a very readable style. Thanks!
5,Excellent book to learn ASP-both for beginners and programmers,"I wish more Programming books were as good and easy to understand. This is a must read book if you are new to ASP, both beginner and Programmer-new to ASP.If you have problem understanding the first few chapters, go pick up Sams teach yourself ASP in 24 hours and then come back to this book."
4,Tried the techniques,"I've started using some of the techniques taught in the book at my Doujou (in Japan). It helped me how to position myself when faced in front of an opponent while up on your feet and put myself in ""safe zones"" at different positions.I can't wait for volume 2 ""Bottom game"" to come out. I hope Royce releases the book as soon as possible. The only reason I rated volume 1, 4 stars, is the lack of techniques needed for the guy at the bottom.Royce, give ALL your techniques to us. PLEASE!"
4,Pretty Good Instructional Book,"This book does a pretty good job of showing technique and providing helpful tips. However, one will not get very much out of it w/o already having a solid grasp of grappling basics and concepts. It does a good job but must be supplemented w/ actual practice... of course."
5,Ultimate Fighting Techniques (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu series),"this book is a complete guide to the best teckniques out there.it comes complete with what to do and what not to do and why you wouldn't want to do them , an overall great book"
3,"Love the Sears', Just Not This Book!","I love the Sears and have read almost all of their works. However, I have to say that I can't stand the way they treat handling a fussy baby. They didn't have a fussy baby until their fourth child. As a first time mother, I just don't like the way they seem to act like having a fussy baby is no big deal and that I'm doing something wrong when I can't figure out what is wrong and get frustrated. None of the advice that they have offered so far has worked for us.I just don't think that this book is useful for first time parents with a high-needs baby. All my friends in the same situation agree.I just don't think that they can empathize with someone who has never had to handle a baby at all before and then suddenly has a high-needs baby.I love all of their other works and highly recommend them and perhaps for someone who has already had children, this may be useful. But for first-time parents, I advise you look elsewhere."
3,"Well, if you've gone to his website...","there is no need to read this book because it doesn't offer any more information. I prefered ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" by Dr. Karp."
1,Skip this book,"I bought this book in desperation, even after I read a review that says exactly what I am going to say.Skip it. I didnt find any information in here that I hadnt already read in the Baby Book."
2,Judgemental and simplistic,"I really wanted ""attachment parenting"" to work for me and my baby, but it did not. I had a baby with colic, and I found that the ideology in this book that you, as the mother, have to do everything possible to stop your baby from crying increased my stress and made me feel worse. After my experience with a colicky baby, I believe that babies sometimes do cry for ""no reason,"" or at least not one that we as adults can always discern with our current knowledge. This book sets up a false dichotomy between attachment parenting and ""crying it out"" which can be quite stressful in its own right if your baby cries inconsolably."
1,I threw this book in the trash!,"Do not buy this book. My baby was crying. I cried when he cried. And I cried even more when I read this book! My son was colicky for the first 6 weeks of his life...until we figured out why! So many people (our pediatrician included) told me to just feed on demand, wear him in the sling, and buy this book. I cried when I read this book. It condemned me to a life of misery when I hadn't given up on figuring out why my son was crying. It turns out he has a dairy allergy. If I had followed the advice of this book, I never would have figured it out and he would have gone on for weeks or months in pain. I knew his cries weren't right and did my own research to discover what was wrong. I eliminated dairy from my diet and he was a NEW baby. The crying stopped immediately. We went on to put him on a routine which allowed him to develop healthy sleeping habits which allowed me some freedom and saved sanity. I threw this book in the trash and never looked back!"
2,Not terribly impressed,"This book should have been called ""The Attachment Parenting Book for Parents Who Would Not Have Read a Book On Attachment Parenting If They Knew That's What It Was Before They Started.""On a more practical note, most of the suggestions they had were not successful with my little one. He has mellowed out as he has gotten past the newborn stage, and we have figured out through simple trial and error what he wants. Your mileage may vary, however. Take the advice for what it's worth."
1,Expert in what?,"I have searched for parenting insight through the askdrsears.com website and this book. Dr. Sears has experience as an M.D. and his wife as an R.N. Yet in this book and on the website, there is detailed advice about developmental psychology, adult psychology, behavioral science, nutrition, biochemistry, sociology, and many other specialized areas of expertise that I'm not convinced they have studied in depth. I don't think it is a good practice for someone to give advice in areas where he or she is not an expert.Much of the wisdom in this book comes from experience dealing with 1 child in 1 environment. How can this experience be applied to many different children with different environments? This is not logically or scientifically sound."
1,Disappointed,The other reviews are correct. Buy The Baby Book. Don't waste your money on this like I did. It contains the exact same info about High Need Babies as The Baby Book does.
2,Major Glitches!,"The game is fun, but has 2 major glitches. I can't believe how horrible this looks for EA.First, the RUSHING error. You gain what looks to be 6-8 yards on a rushing play. The game will then say that you only gained a yard (and sometimes say you lost yardage)! This is terrible. It completely makes running the ball obsolete.Next, when you finish your first season in dynasty mode, you have to complete some ""Off Season"" tasks. When you get to the ""Cut Players"" screen, there is no way to get past it. This is a HUGE bug. You can only play the first season in dynasty mode because of this terrible flaw."
2,Not all the hype is good,"Although the gameplay and momentum is extremely fun, I have noticed a bit of errors - as some stated below and some of my own.After my first season went pretty good, I started a 2nd season. After the 1st game (pushover), it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to move the ball on simply VARSITY mode. And your defense is plain useless.Now for the biggest glitch... I can be trying to play a game in the season, after simulating 2-5, I can even try game 6 and it'll play until the cutscene to the coach on an important play - then it locks up. I have been unable to get past it yet.About to contact EA sports and see if I can get the damn thing replaced - a waste of $50"
1,Beware the rushing yardage bug!!!!,"Don't get me wrong. The game is a lot of fun. I'm a big fan of college football and the NCAA Football franchise. However, there is a serious bug in the game that I cannot believe was overlooked by EA. In short, the computer subtracts about 5-6 yards from the end of every run.For instance, I was playing against the computer and faced a 3rd and 2. I ran the ball up the middle and picked up about 8 yards. Or so I thought. Instead of showing a first down, it showed 4th and inches! Huh! And this was not an isolated incident. About every other rush this happened.I sincerely hope EA fixes this error and replaces all the copies containing this bug (like they did with the Madden 06 bug). If this does not sound like a big issue to you or you never rush the ball anyway, then get the game. With the exception of this bug the game is great. But personally I would definitely not recommend purchasing this game until this bug is fixed. In fact, I wish I didn't buy it."
1,What the $%#$?,"I would love to say that this is killer game especially with reggie on the cover, but there are just too many problems that it isn't even worth playing. So far I have experienced- the ""rushing glitch"" where you run for 8 - 10 yards and the computer rewards you with 2nd and 8.- an erratic menu where it is difficult to select plays because the highlighted item is jumping around.- inability to kick/punt the ball because the snap button won't function during the kicking game.While I remember tearing up Madden 96 with no punts or kicks, and few rushing attempts, the AI is much better now and doesn't allow for such aggressive play. (Damn the dolphins were so good back then).Regrettably, you will soon see me in the return line of a local Target.Is anyone else experiencing these same problems listed above?"
4,A Very Good PSP sports game,"As an avid NCAA fan, I love this game. I have not experienced any of the glitches mentioned in the other reviews, but I did experience them in Madden 06, so maybe it is the actual disc you get. The gameplay is much smoother than Madden 06 and I love the zoom in on critical plays/big hits, ...Don't expect it to be as good as PS2, the PSP is a much smaller system - so you don't get to create a school or create players. You still play rivalry and dynasty mode, which is great. I play mine all the time and have never had a problem. Plus I downloaded my UF roster and plugged the data into my PSP so I get all the names, ... on the jersey and in the commentary. All in all, for a handheld it is a topnotch game. If they found a way to put the other features in it, and if the option were a little easier to execute I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Great machine - shame about the after-sales service.,The waterrower is a great machine with the smooth motion removing the jerking present in other machines. If you are using third party software to analyse your training you may find that it does not work with later models of the machine. I decided to give mine a spruce-up and ordered about $20 of parts online. I cancelled the order when Waterrower quoted $148 postage!
1,Delivery was a problem,"I haven't even gotten this home, yet, but that's my problem due to the delivery specifying that an in-person signature is required. Not knowing this, I had it delivered at home where I've had about 100 packages left, including items larger and more expensive than this, with no problems. Since I work for a living and can't hang around all day awaiting delivery, I switched the delivery to my workplace. The problem now is that the thing is so big that it'll never fit in my car. Be forewarned that Amazon will make accepting delivery of this item a problem for most people.WaterRower Natural Rowing Machine in Ash Wood"
5,good hooks,These are nicely sized and sharp. They hold the string well. They are good for trout fishing. I would buy these again. I cant find these at walmart or any of the large chain sporting goods in my location.
5,Get This One,"This gem of a recording captures Buddy Rich and his amazing Killer Force Band at their best during a live performance. Though a few sound blips are present, the recording quality is otherwise excellent. Buddy sounds amazing as usual, and the trumpet section is perhaps Buddy's best ever. The liner notes incorrectly identify Chuck Schmidt, when it is in fact Dave Stahl playing lead on this album. All trumpet players should listen to this concert as a study in perfect big band trumpet section and lead playing. A great recording."
3,It's OK...,"I bought this in red (half my kitchen is red KitchenAid), but I wasn't all that impressed. It's bulky...and it doesn't allow a lot of food to be transported at once. It's exactly the same size as my knife, and since that's way easier, I'll just stick with that... I'm going to get the ""OXO Good Grips 73281 Pastry Scraper"" instead, for the bigger jobs. I'll probably keep this one around, but I don't really like it."
5,"Angry, Energizing , Alive and Fabulous","Hip hop meets Mideastern chants. This album is masterpiece.That fact that this album was released just a month after theSeptember 11, 2001 attacks is more than a curiosity, it's almost creepy, particualarly when one looks at the track titles. ""Day of Dispair"", ""Eastern Winds"" and the title track.The mixing and mastering are incredible, Play it LOUD!"
4,Dummy,"Product was pretty good, but with 100s of years of history the number of names/places can get a little overwhelming for the regular dummy."
1,Wrong.,"I made it as far as the quote in the first chapter that said: ""...the corn lands of Egypt that supplied the Romans with bread."" Yeah, right. An historian who puts corn in ancient Egypt isn't enough of an historian to keep reading."
2,"Superficial, biased and glib","This is a vacuous, oversimplified mess. The author glibly makes wisecracks that are either insulting to people from early days or are incomprehensible to someone seeking to learn a few facts of European History. I will also say that I got the book because I have been reading a complete history of the Popes and I wanted to ""fit"" each Pope into his proper historical period- well guess what? I imagine because this is under the ""dummies"" title - but the author rarely tells you the YEARS that each of the rulers reigned, with a few exceptions, of course - the result it that the middle ages, as per usual, blends into a goofy, society of creative anachronisms type of stew.Skip this if you want to learn anything about history. I also agree with the other poster regarding the downplaying and negligible discussion of the inquisition - and I am a Roman Catholic. Let's not rewrite history."
2,"Quick shipper, Product taste horrible","Product arrived quickly and in great condition. The product taste is horrible. Don't know if it works, could not take it."
2,Not well made,"The timer seek function does not work well. If you set it to reverse 3h30m then it may go back 3h30m or 4 hr or 3 hr. Very annoying.I've had my VCR crash, eject the tape and turn itself off a number of times now. It has probably happened 4-6 times over the past year. It does so for no apparent reason. It seem to flash some sort of error message with a number and a funky looking character after doing so.I get bad hissing sound when playing old tapes recorded on my old Philips VCR.The remote is poorly laid out.My last Philips VCR was just fine and had none of these flaws. This model is a step backwards for them.I'm going to get another brand to replace this one. I don't think I'll return to Philips again."
2,A disappointment,"I've written two books on computers and I've trained more than 10,000 people how to use computers BUT I CAN'T PROGRAM THIS THING CORRECTLY--at least not consistently. The user interface is very poor. What's more, my Philips television's remote cannot fully control the VCR. The VCR's menu at one point says to click the ""Clear"" button, a button that doesn't exist on the TV remote. Oh, and the automatic clock setting feature doesn't work. The clock is always off by an hour or so, despite the fact that the TV has no trouble with the same feature.Another reviewer here mentioned problems with the program list. Yep, I concur. It's annoying and confusing.In short, pass this one up. And think long and hard before buying any Philips product. I know I will."
3,Average,"This model was easy to set up & use. But the light-up buttons on the remote are very annoying. I could live with that, but two things I cannot live with: the EXTREMELY blue clock BURNING out my eyes, and the very noisy mechanism. I can't hear what I'm watching on the TV while I'm taping, because the tape mechanism is so noisy. That, coupled with the blindingly bright display (even brighter when unit is on, oh, joy), is prompting me to return this to the store."
3,Product as Advertised...,"Mounting cup was as advertised- came with a good assortment of fittings, screws and hoses to provide a wide range of mounting options. I used it as a mounting cup for my Subaru WRX ""SPT"" Boost Gauge- Looks good. Real composite, not ""carbon look""."
1,Garbage,"[...]This is probably the worst thing I have ever read. It's basically just Sotos' nonsensical, meanderings on child pornography and homosexuals using glory holes, interspersed with quotes from newspaper articles about child abductions and what not. I'm not sure what effect this is supposed to have on the reader, but I was pretty much just bored by it. It feels like just a bunch of random words about pedophilia and other disturbing subjects thrown together, with nothing really holding them together to give the reader something to focus his attention on. I expected this book to be disturbing. It wasn't. It was tedious. I couldn't help but skim over much of it. Upon finishing this book most people will ask themselves like I did ""what was the point?"" and ""Can I have my (expletive deleted) money back?"" Avoid this book like you'd avoid condomless intimacy with Magic Johnson."
4,Feels sturdy and works good,This corer feels sturdy and it punches a big hole. The only problem is that it isn't serrated like the other corers I have. That is its only draw back I have found. I have used this silly thing almost everyday since I got it and it works great. My son doesn't care for it because it takes more force to get it started but it does the job quickand clean.
2,Praise/Worship Music,"This book contained so many wonderful songs but I found it too difficult for my music ability. If you are an achieved pianist, this book is for you. Otherwise you might want to settle for a more basic book."
5,Piano Praise and Worship,"This is a great book for daily use. Having only a handful of years of piano long ago, this is the perfect book for someone like me wanting to play praise and worship but not having time to further in formal lessons. The notes are large and spaced out and the chords are simple (simple to intermediate level) and repetitive throughout the songs. This book is a great way to master some popular worship songs and sound great doing so. There are a lot of repeats throughout the book, giving great reviews in using the Coda and D.S. al Coda! I am planning on soon purchasing the other book in this series."
4,great deal,"Great deal, good value for the money. Good picture quality raves that of a sony Trinitron.Sound quality/ volume could be better but nothing a home theater sound system couldn't fix. Good appearance easy to opperate controls. Best deal for your money and it's 32 in."
1,[Too much] for a TV that lasted 15 whole months!,"We bought this TV January 27, 2001, and have had it for 15 months now (April 5, 2002), the TV was great up until tonight when the picture tube blew! Doesn't make much sense to spend [this kind of money] on a TV that doesn't last. More than likely will never buy another Philips Magnavox product. Stick to a decent brand name (Sony, Panasonic). The waarranty is pathetic 90 dayd free labor, one year free replacement parts, and 2 years on the picture tube, the only problem is getting ahold of anyone on the help lines."
5,Long Lasting TV,I bought this TV through Amazon back in 2000. Picture quality is still great and still going going strong. This TV is a trooper. As with all TVs if you want phenomenal sound I would connect to a surround system.
1,Yuck,I purchased this product for my Maltese. I like for him to smell good!! This Very Berry stuff must be made from rotten berries!! It really smells horrible. I gave another bath to get rid of the yucky smell
2,Berry,I'm not all that happy with the scent of this grooming spray but i did receive it fast and secure
3,OK for the City in Summer/maybe Fall/ Travel,"The Jacket/Vest is OK but I have some issues with it. I would not take this jacket/vest on a real Safari, Camping or use it for carrying heavy Camera stuff. This jacket/vest is strictly a City or Airport/Travel Jacket/Vest for me. It seems to be OK for carrying lots of papers, nothing heavy, that's about it. The cotton material is just a little thicker than a cotton T-shirt, I have cotton pants thicker than this. The lined pockets are very thin and if you have a bunch of keys like I do, I can see them wearing through in a very short time. If it rains you are going to get wet really fast. Don't get me wrong I like the look of the jacket/vest and love the pockets/zip off sleeves, good fit (XXL), very light weight, but I just wish they would have made this out of polly blend or thicker cotton. I will keep the vest but I feel like I over paid for what I got. Maybe the Chinese have asked for higher pay?"
4,Surprises,"I was very pleased to receive the khaki convertible safari outback jacket/ vest promptly by mail, AND received with it a few surprises to which I have had to adjust: (1) the color was not khaki, but khaki-green; (2) the item was stone-washed, which gives it a well-worn look appealing only to some; (3) the elasticized wrist-bands were too tight (designed for Chinese wrists?), cutting off circulation, and I had to cut into the right one to relieve the pressure. Other than that, the item is exciting in its practicality, design, fit, and good looks. I wear it daily, as I plan to in the desert-climate of Palestine. It was a whole lot less expensive than the National Geographic version. Thank you, Galaxy Army-Navy. RM"
4,"A nice jacket and vest combo, one flaw","I was disappointed with one flaw in the design of this product. The jacket has these two vents in the back which are great for hot climates, but not rain proof for the Northwest coast. Not the perfect jacket for the northwest. The other odd thing about this jacket is the two pockets on the right hand side, they are long and narrow. At first I could find no practical purpose for them unless I was a photographer in need of a place for lens or a place to put ak47 magazines. Then I discovered a beer bottle fits perfectly inside, I guess they are practical after all."
5,Awesome set,"My kids loved these books when they were little so when my brother named his baby Amelia, I searched and searched to find a great set at a great price!"
2,Tiresome,"I really enjoy reading the majority of children's books to my kids. This series is tiresome: long stories, repetitive themes. It's not the worst series in the world, but I avoid reading it whenever possible."
4,The eyes of texas are upon us,"A pleasant surprise, this compilation of Beneke's later orchestra (sans strings). The opening bars of the first title (""The Eyes of Texas.."") give me goosepimples every time I listen to them and seldom have I heard such soulful tenorsaxing as in ""It'So Peaceful in the Country"". The band could swing too (how could it help doing so with none other than Mel Lewis on the drums!). The tracks are taken from for-radio-only discs (never commercially released) and the sound is generally good. The information in the booklet is sadly lacking in substance. The music however speaks for itself and is most enjoyable"
3,Doleful but interest holding,"The author was born on Mar 5, 1892, in Sioux City and is the subject of an excellent biography by Elinor Lnager , which I read with much appreciation on May 25, 1985. But this is the first book of Herbst's which I have read. It tells of a family:f a mother and six children: Joe, Catherine, Aaron, Hortense, Anne, and David. Joe goes to Georgia and gets mixed up with carpetbaggers and commits fraud--which dogs him for years but of which he never is convicted . None of the boys are admirable, but the mother and the girls are hard workers and always loyal to the non-admirable boys. The prose is somewaht choppy and the author sometimes tells what will happen in the future, thus lessening one's interest in the account as it proceeds. Most of the family is dogged by poverty and the book is pretty doleful. But I think I may read the next volume in the trilogy, The Executioner Waits."
1,Lousy soccer and the sex is even worse,"Okay, okay, I bought this DVD as kind of a joke for/on my soccer loving friends. This movie is soft core porn with the worst sex scenes I have ever seen in my life. It makes you wonder how there could be 1.3B Chinese in the world. While the star/hero/coach is a bad lay, he has some comedic talent, judging by his expressions (I have to read the sub-titles, so can't attest to his diction).The soccer is really terrible, which is the whole point of the movie--how girls can beat guys at soccer by displaying their wares.You know what? Don't even rent this movie."
1,Dont waste your time and money,"This is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I was expecting it to be bad, but this movie just went beyond that!"
1,I thought I was gettingsomething as similar as Shaolin Soccer...,"This movie is trash. It's a sorry excuse for a home video soft porn flick, and a bad one at that. Save your money, don't bother."
4,God Wrote Only One Bible,The book was in good shape. It was a good book to read about the history of the KJV and the modern versions out there that has been corrupted.
4,Good not great,"I have seen many Bergman films and love them all. ""Shame"" is a good Bergman film but not one of his best. Everything about the movie is great - the performances, the photography, the script etc etc. What disappointed me with the film was the lack of authenticity depicted in the war scenes. I guess before movies like ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", this movie would have been considered very realistic in the way the war was depicted. However Bergman had never done a war movie before and it shows. Still, the other aspects of the film are top notch and overall worthy of 4 stars."
1,wrongly cropped from OAR 1.37:1 to 1.66:1 and it looks awful,MGM have not fully researched the OAR of this film. They have released this DVD in the wrong aspect ratio (1.66:1 instead of 1.37:1) resulting in A LOT of bad looking framing.The film may have been released theatrically in the US at 1.66:1 but if so THIS WAS WRONG. The OAR of the film is 1.37:1 and it is released in this ratio around the world (see the recent French DVD for example).
5,Coping with Lyme Disease is both realistic and informative,"As an eleven year suffer of Chronic Lyme Disease I found Coping with Lyme Disease to be an accurate,reliable, informative source of both the Disease itself and the politics involved with Lyme Disease.It is a must read for any person who has been diagnosed with Lyme Disease or who suspects they have it and can't find a Doctor to treat it. I have bought many copies of this book and share it with both other Lyme victims and Physicians within my community that are not knowledgeable about this devistating illness and the politics that surround it. Denise Lang did a wonderful job in both editions of this book!"
4,Great Book,I would give this book a 5 if it had information for men. I agree with an earlier reviewer about that point. But the book is very informative and the best book out there for individuals with Lyme. I wish I had read it sooner.
1,Rehash of instruction sheets from various manufacturers.,"Although it had its merits, this book was primarily a rehash of instruction manuals from various lock manufacturers. Upon receiving this title I was sorely disappointed. I would recommend a beginning locksmith or lock enthusiast look to another title first."
4,Manipulating the senses....,"A great album full of funk,chill out tunes and great hip/hop gems.These guys can really get your ... of the seat,but also have the talent to keep you there cool and relaxed with there super cool chillout tunes.I'm not usually into this style of music, but was immediatly drawn into it by hearing ""Fusion"" and ""Showtime"" on the radio. Those funky, james brown esc beats just grab me everytime.These dudes are a great example of Australian dance/hip hop + they've won awards for Best Album/best producer.Recently saw them live and they were awsome!! BUY THIS ALBUM!!"
3,Just missed the punch,"This CD at first gives the impression of delivering the ultimate mix of funk, break beats, jazz and hip-hop with some sweet mixing and cutting.Unfortunately it milks it's one asset the whole album. While the production is awesome, it's testament to the fact that it alone down't give life to music.I'd prefer someone like Cut Chemist or DJ Shadow over this, where the art and creative is in your face and not just premeditated cuts. Then again, it's nice chill background music."
2,Mixed Bag,"There are both highs and lows in this series. The high: this is the role of a lifetime for Glenn Close -- she is simply superb. On the other hand, the second lead, played by Rose Byrne, is pretty bad. Not really the actress's fault -- she's just really miscast: a hard-nosed young lawyer type she is NOT. The storyline and continuity are poor: the changing back and forth from present to past is poorly done, and left me unable to track the progression of the plot."
1,"stupid, packed with clichès","It's quite offputting to realise most amazon customers who reviewed this show think it is good. Says a lot about how much the average brain is not only getting faster, it's getting stupider. This series is boring, formulaic, implausible. You have to assume every character in it is a nimrod, otherwise it makes no sense. To call it ""Sopranos for lawyers"" is tantamount to equating salinger and danielle steele because they both wrote about death. The Sopranos is a masterpiece, it has substance all along. Damages is plain silly. A more apt comparison is Dinasty or Dallas (with good actors), though I'd suspect characters in Dallas and Dinasty were more consistent and reasonable. And probably less empty.[...]"
3,damages ok!,The product arrived ok but the quality of the disc is just ok. It had some freeze spots during the first two stories. I hope the rest is ok. Bob Mangini
1,Rent it before you buy it.,"Thank goodness we only rented disk 1. One episode was all my wife and I could tolerate. If you like spending time with a whole bunch of uniformly despicable characters, maybe you'll like it. Glenn Close plays a total b*tch; Danson plays a complete a-hole, so why should anyone care who prevails? We found the first episode unbelievable, manipulative and bogus. Obviously we're a minority among the reviewers, but rent before you buy."
5,Damages Season 1,I think this is an excellent series and look forward to purchasing the second series. The deception throughout the entire series is just too much to bear and I can only imagine it getting worse.
4,A successful series,"""Damages"" was fast paced and exciting for the entire series. The characters were not predictable, making for greater suspense. I look forward to the second season."
2,Interminable Soap Opera,"What a waste of good actors! If you are expecting a legal, procedural drama (like Canterbury's Law, for example), this is not it. This is a soap opera. I stopped watching toward the end of season 1: the plot unfolds a little in each episode, but there is really nothing to stretch out for so many episodes, and the script is just a long series of short sentences. There are only a few scenes of human interactions and emotions, but mostly the characters simply ""walk-through"" this drama (like zombies), deadpanning their lines."
5,Best show ever!,This is hands down the best thriller show I've ever seen. It keeps you hooked for the whole season. I watched seasons 1-3 on DirectTV (before the 4th season premiered) they were replaying those seasons in order. I was so use to watching them 2 episodes at a time and not having to wait for the next season. Seriously this is the best show you should check it out.
5,One of the best shows on television.,"Damages is a complex tale of lies, deceit, and misdirection that revolves around a hard driving owner of a prestigious law firm, played by Glen Close), a ruthless businessman, (played by Ted Danson), and a myriad of lesser known supporting actors. To say the plot is intricate would grossly understate the matter, but once the viewer reaches the understanding that the main theme is ""trust no-one!"" It becomes a roller coaster of plot twists that keep right on coming until the closing scene."
4,Smart show with characters that engage.,"This is a great show that loves to twist the story as much as the writers' minds will allow them. The first season sets up a landscape for the viewer to watch the characters' lives untangle piece-by-piece each in somewhat predictable but entertaining ways.All in all, good writing, production, stories, cast and (what it seemed like) crew to pull off a great show for five seasons."
5,Damages: The Complete First Season,"One of the, if not, the best show I ever watched. I had heard it was a good show and worth checking out. I watched a couple episodes and was totally hooked on it, and ended up watching the entire season in one day!!Damages: The Complete First Season"
5,"The Movie, Damages",Damages is the best movie I have seen in many years. The story and the acting are excellent. I watched the movie on a Saturday and moved from my chair only for the purpose of going to the bathroom. I plan to purchase a DVD of the second series as soon as it is available so that I can watch this thriller again.Climetene McClain
4,Close Caption,"I love buying movies from you, but how do I know if the movie has captions in English? Damages has only in French..."
3,Damages Season 1,"Glenn Close and Ted Danson are remarkable thus far. Not too far into the season. I hope this serial doesn't devolve into a tryst of Lust, sex and betrayal. Great character development so far. Have only seen 4 episodes."
4,Very good,"Was happy to see this on Prime. Remember wanting to watch it when it first aired, but it was on too late!I really enjoyed this first season and got through the episodes pretty fast. The bulk of the story is tied up in the last episode and I was glad to see this. These were some rotten people :)"
1,At Least Glenn Close is Good,"The acting is good on this show..but they have very little to work with.The storyline, characters, and dialogue are all cliches. The one thought that kept returning as the episodes plodded along was that this series must have been written by edgy romance novelists.It's a shame that Glenn Close's impressive abilities are wasted.Perhaps the most annoying element was how the big mystery to the season was constantly referred to. By the sixth episode I really didn't care anymore. By then all interest in the show was gone for me. I assumed that the big secret would be as annoying as the rest of the show."
5,excellent and very exciting,"I really enjoyed season one, which I never got to see on television. I did not start watching it until season three. I did not know anything about it, maybe because I did not ever watch the station that it appeared on.I thought the acting was spactacular."
5,fantastic,Glen Close is great as an attorney.My grandaughter watched it with me and hated when it was over even though it took us 2 days to watch it
5,A thriller that is hard to stop watching,The best thriller in ages. I do not understand why this series was not on any of the major networks.
1,This Map Not Road Tested!!,"This map is absolutely useless! The map is divided into sections separated by clear plastic, making it difficult, no, impossible! to tell where the maze of roads and canals flows from one section to another. They don't line up across the divisions. Skip this map and get a free paper one when you get to the city. Better yet, just wander around and enjoy one being lost in one of the most beautiful cities on earth. I threw this map away."
3,Light Reading and Enjoyable,"If you're looking for an interesting and fast reading book on the Revolutionary War, you may want to pick up this as a starter. The chapters are short and provide quite a bit of information about the principal characters. I did find, however, two errors of minor consequence. One has John Adams buried in the Garnary Burying Ground in downtown Boston, when it is Sam Adams who is buried there. The other error, I believe, is made when the author quotes Colonel William Prescott as the author of the line, ""Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes"" at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Other sources attribute this line to Israel Putnam, who supposedly was quoting a Prussian prince from 30 years earlier. In any case I found this to be an enjoyable book and I suggest it to anyone who finds this war to be interesting reading."
5,X-MEN #25,"This is an awesome comic, one of my favorites. It reminds me of the old days of comic books, and had some of my favorite artist rendition of the X-Men. If you haven't read this comic, you are missing out. Wolverine getting his adamantium ripped out is pretty epic!"
5,Great for a beginner,"Whether you're interested in learning about piranhas for your own enlightenment or starting your own piranha tank, this book is great. There's a little information on most different types of piranhas and a lot of general information for piranha care. The author also goes into detail of his own experiences with piranhas in their natural environment."
2,not worth it,"there isnt any information in here that anyone who has kept a successful fish tank wouldnt already know, and it seems like none of then info is specific to piranhas. he doesnt go over what size tanks piranhas need, or that they dont like a lot of light, or that they need a heater guard to prevent them from breaking it, or that they can chew through air hoses. seems like a basic fish keeping book plus 2 chapters on piranha history and species."
2,Would not fit to screen.,"Even though picture quality was good, even using tracking I could not get the picture on the screen properly. It was approx. 2 inches off the bottom."
2,dougv,Prayer and the Word of God have long been very important to me.I had hopes that this would be a practical book on Scriptural prayer.The content is introductory and it repeats comments often.It doesn't give new or helpful prayer tips and it has only a few sample Scriptural prayers.I don't recommend buying it.
5,"Creeping like a communist, it's knocking at our doors","Turning all our children into hooligans and whoresVoraciously devouring the way things are todaySavagely deflowering the good ol' U.S.A.It's Reefer Madness, Reefer MadnessOh so mad!"
5,Great fricken movie,GOt it for a gift.Shyits legit!the original movie is ok to watch for a laugh. but this one kills me everytime i watch it
4,Reefer Madness Movie musical,"I rate this production as very cleverly scripted and acted although some tonge in cheek acting the picture and sound was fine,the only thing that i personley would criticise is the out of hand violence and gore towards the end of the muisical."
4,Worthy of a Rocky Horror-esque cult following,This movie was far better than its direct-to-Showtime status would have you believe. It's a musical adaptation of the original black-and-white cult classic that also serves as a social commentary on the way our government exploits the helpless masses... read more This movie was far better than its direct-to-Showtime status would have you believe. It's a musical adaptation of the original black-and-white cult classic that also serves as a social commentary on the way our government exploits the helpless masses. Did I mention it's hilarious and the tunes are infectious? I think Reefer Madness is worthy of a Rocky Horror-esque cult following.
5,Wickedly Funny,"This movie is really entertaining, and so funny. I heard of the original black and white movie. but this was a nice little gem. its a shame they dont have the movie soundtrack to it. I'd go out and buy it in a heart beat."
5,My Favorite Musical,"If you're into musicals, satire, comedy, or Kristen Bell, this is the movie for you.Even on a shallow level this film will have you laughing from start to finish. If you're paying close attention, and know a little bit about the political drug history of the United States, there's also many, many subtle jokes hidden throughout the movie - note the name of the High school.I can't think of a single reason why anybody should pass this movie by."
5,Vintage Hedges,"I am a long time Michael Hedges fan, and somehow missed this cd. I had to wait for delivery since i wanted a full quality hard copy, I was excited when it arrived. I certainly wasn't disapointed, thi is classic Hedges in his prime. the entire set flows flawlessly, and Michaels guitar work is awesome. It was a sad day for music when we lost Michael Hedges, and I was so happy to find this album. I would recomend this album to most any musical taste."
2,disappointing,"Hedges was a world class acoustic guitarist...but you'd never know it from this album. His biggest ""hit"" (a cover of ""All Along the Watchtower"") is on here...but even that's not as good as it's hyped. The lyrics are fine, but on top of the substandard vocals is the demo quality production (I seem to remember ""recorded in his living room"" from the liner notes?). To top it all off, the electric guitar parts sound terrible and out of place on this album."
3,sex and more,"if you are interseted in the history of sex this book has it all. Not a completely riveting account of english sexual practices, this book focuses more on the transistion of attitudes toward sex in the 18th century.The author pretends that penetrative sex became popular during this time frame and thus homosexuality and fallatio became taboo. he discounts religion and the industrial revolution as significant factors to popular attitudes toward sex and the population explosion respectively.Hitchcock presents an important introduction to the historiography of sex, but lacking in the accuracy of his conclusions."
5,Complete Set,This set contains all you will need for your baking and cooking needs for measuring liquid and solid products. Great Buy!
2,Labels fade away,"In moderate use for a couple years, the measuring labels have faded away. Makes the 1/3 and 1/2 slightly tricky to distinguish. Otherwise, the plastic has held up very well to dishwasher cleaning."
5,Zino cant do better...,"best smelling cologne for men by davidoff, lasts the whole day and smells like it was just applied! been buying it for years."
5,This is the one,"I haven't heard any of the other Nylons albums, but I think its safe to say that this is the album for you to buy. I listened to this as a child on all of our family road trips and can think of few other albums that make me want to sing like this one. Take it in your car, turn up the volume and you'll be hooked!"
5,"great spoons, ...price excessive?","I love Kitchen Aid products and I love red in the kitchen. These are very sturdy, and easy to use. I have Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer(red), and grinder (red), etc, so these coordinate well. The small ones are bulbous and hard to get into tinned square-box spices, but seem okay for many spice bottles and for poured ingredients. If price is important to you, you may get the same Kitchen Aid Measuring Spoon set for only $2.99 at Target stores."
4,Father in the dark,"""My Father Sits in the Dark"" is a great story about a boy who always questions why his father is sitting in the dark.In the end he finds out why, and realizes it's a good reason."
3,Beautiful robust voice in uncertain territory,"Jorma Hynninen, one of the greatest classical/operatic baritones here sings American pop classics with pianist Heikki Sarmanto. While the voice is beautiful and robust, the diction is quite unidiomatic in these workds. The result is that the pronunciation of the words sounds very artificial, as if the syllables are repeated by rote from an uninformed coach. The piano accompaniment could also be more idiomatic as well. What is needed is something like Bobby Short on piano where a jazzy idiom could be given with great style to accompany the many moods of these songs which are all about love. Nevertheless, Hynninen is a pleasure to hear in any music and I have enjoyed this album despite its flaws."
5,I Like This Video.,I Have Seen This Video. It Is Great. Vince is 1 of my best singers. I like When I call Your Name and I Still Believe in you.
5,Great product,My husband wanted a flag pole for Christmas and I purchased this one. It is beautiful. Easy to set up. (We did use quickcrete and we used 80 + pounds). I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to put a flagpole in their yard.
3,18' Flagpole,"We haven't had a chance to install the flagpole yet as the ground is still frozen. However, upon opening the box, we found the gold ball for the top of the pole to be smashed, and the plastic box it was supposed to be in was literally in no less than 15 pieces. I have read the reviews on this before purchasing it, and there definitely seems to be a problem with the way these are packaged as many others have experienced the same problem. All in all, so far, the rest of the product is as described."
5,High Flying Flag,"This flag pole was very easy to assemble and it is very sturdy. The flag is of very good quality. It looks beautiful in our front yard. Shipping was fast and customer service was excellent. Like others, the gold ball was destroyed in the mail. I called the company and the replacement arrived in a few days. I will definitely do business again with this company."
1,Valley Forge needs to rethink packing,"I ordered this flag pole kit from Ace Hardware, through Amazon, and when I received it, the gold ball and the small box it was packed in was crushed. I called Ace Hardware Warehouse and they were very attentive to my problem and promised to send a second kit. When I received it, I carefully opened it and sure enough, the gold ball and the box it was in was packed below the pipes which crushed both the ball and the box, as before. There's nothing on the box that tells shippers and handlers not to stand the box on it's end and, not knowing, that's the way UPS left it at our door. Highly recommend Ace hardware but until Valley Forge rethinks the way they pack this kit, you're wasting your time."
5,Looks great and is very sturdy. Easy to install,"I bought one for myself, installed it and it looks great and am proud to fly my country's flag. My son loved it and so I ordered him one too."
4,very nice flag set,I purchased this set after reading several positive reviews. I gave it as a gift to a soldier and he loved it. We have mild weather here so no problems with strong winds to worry about. Very good value for the money.
1,Junk,These bent the second time I rode with them while pulling up on the handlebars to clear a curb. Do yourself a favor and buy some of higher quality--safety is more important.
1,DO NOT BUY!!! HAZARDOUS!!!,"My initial review was a good rating because they did what I needed them to do which was give me leg clearance. I read the review that said he bent his coming off of a curb and that made my weary because I weigh around 240 lbs. But after a few months of being careful, I got a little careless I guess and stressed these a little too much and it all added up... I just ride for exercise mostly up hills so not too much I can really do as far as ""extremes."" The incident occurred oddly enough, after waiting to cross at a crosswalk. The light turned green and I proceeded off a 5 inch curb and WHAM!!! The left side bends upward right as I get in the intersection, a busy one I might add, a little embarassing...However not as embarrassing as that happening at 20mph or as ruinous! THANK GOD that happened then instead of face-planting at top-speed. Im not the prettiest man alive, but far too pretty to be sliding on my face....STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!!!"
5,An Introduction to Scientific Research by E. Bright Wilson,"The best and the most practical book I have ever seen about general aspects of carrying out scientific research. Author logically starts with choosing a topic for ones research project and ends with article publication. Though author discusses mostly experimental aspects of a research work, I have found it applicable for the field of computer simulations as well.I also have successfully used this book for designing and teaching undergraduate physics labs. It is an endless source of examples. Some material, such as data and error analysis, can be even ``incorporated'' as a part of regular lab manuals."
1,I am very disappointed,"Before I bought this book, I think this book is about the philosophical account on the scientific research. After I bought this book, then what? I was very disappointed, this book is just about the practical application of experimental design in scientific research. Thus, the more apt title for this book is ""Application of Experimental Design in Scientific Research""."
3,"it's funny..., this album gets better with beer...","What I can't understand is why this music just gets better with alcohol. Maybe it's the Irish in it, but a slight buzz absolutely magnifies my enjoyment for this album. I can remember my roommate throwing on not one, but both discs and a friendly, evening gathering. I distinctly remember myself saying ""what's this?,"" with a confused look on my face, as I was passed a bottle of Irish Whisky. Well, still just a young lad, weighing in at only 123 pounds, it wasn't long before I was dancing half naked on the coffee table, proclaiming all to hail ""The Lord of the Dance!""So, you wonder why I've decided only to allot 3 stars for my recomendation of Lord of the Dance & Riverdance? Simple. I listened to it a week later, sober."
1,Bad camera,"I've used this item from Kodak twice as a last resort. Was disappointed both times. Picture quality was OK outside where flash wasn't needed, but inside the flash usually did not work and even when it did, the results were terrible - dark grainy pictures. Unfortunately these pictures were taken at attractions that we probably will not get to visit again so those 'memories' are forever lost. When I called Kodak about my concerns, they just offered me another replacement of the same camera. A lot of good that would have done me - I declined their offer. Why would I want another piece of junk?"
5,Disposable Cameras,These were purchased as stocking gifts for grandchildren to use on Christmas Day. They were thrilled to receive them. The price was just right for them.
1,Surprise! Only choice in stock. Am I getting any pics?,"I used the last 35 mm picture and took it to be developed at Sam's Club. Lady told me they don't sell film any more; you have to buy these disposable thingies. Got a new pup. Want to take pics. Bought the 3 pack. Took a couple pics and the flash went off. Now, no flash. Started the 2nd one in the pack. 27 pics inside? It doesn't flash. I have no idea what I'm getting and the pup is growing. I'm going to look for 35 mm film AND buy a digital. This ""Guess what you got after taking 54 pictures"" is not the kind of suspense I want."
3,A mixed bag,"This is really a comprehensive collection. That is its best feature. But remember, the older the show, the poorer the quality. Some of these are really of poor quality. Included are some first parts of serials (Rocky Jones, Flash Gordon). These are quite terrible. One must be really nostalgic in order to watch those silly efects. Perhaps this makes it fun for some. Some of the shows are in other packages, but it does not bother much. Some of the comedies were too much for my taste, but these depend on what you like. There are a few I have not watched, yet, but The Deputy was a very fine episode with good film quality, too. I liked also Cowboy G-men. Sergeant Preston has great color and natural vistas. The cost is not much for 101 ""classics"", some of which did not last long. I do not regret buying it."
4,CTX is OK,The BodyBlade CTX is pretty much as advertised. Is rather fun to use. It is shorter than I thought it was. Can still work up a sweat useing it!
5,Putting The Burn On,This has been an awesome piece of equipment to add to my personal gym as it helps me really work those arm muscles with people especially near the end of their upper body workout. I am very pleased with it. I also see it's potential to help others with therapeutic needs especially after surgeries or with the older population.Amazon has always given me the chance to add great things to my business and personal life. Thank you and they always come very quickly and are well taken care of in the shipping process.
4,Good Value,These replacement bags are difficult to find in stores. About only place now is on-line. These were the most reasonably priced. A good value. I can keep cleaning with the old vacuum.
3,"good for udon and ravioli, not so great for angelhair","When I first got these tongs, I was deeply disappointed - the tongs are clearly just stamped out of a sheet of steel and then bent in half, and they look pretty cheap. Then, I tried them to fish some potstickers out of boiling water, and sorta changed my mind.The tongs look cheap, but work really well for dumplings and other big floating stuff, and for thick pasta. Thin pasta, however, tends to fall through the prongs (which touch at their tips, not interlace). If you hold the tongs more firmly so small stuff doesn't fall through, it gets crushed - the ends are slightly concave, but too shallow to really make a pouch.This would be perfect if the prongs were square-ended, and the wide solid part of the ends was more deeply concave. As it is, it depends on what you're cooking."
3,eureka 3670G mighty mite canister vacuum,"We bought this vacuum a few months ago. We like the way it cleans the carpet in our cars, but it is VERY LOUD. We wear ear plugs when using it because of the high pitched, loud motor. It is light-weight and easy to carry around for cleaning out cars and cleaning steps if you don't mind wearing plugs while you work."
3,Cheap Hose,I wanted a vacuum that was lightweight and was powerful enough to pick up pet hair and dirt. It is powerful and lightweight- exactly what I thought I wanted but....the hose is flimsy and constantly gets twisted. Even though it cleans well and is lightweight what good is it if the hose does not work properly. I wish I could find a replacement hose that is well made and fits this model.
5,Wonderful,"I read all the reviews on this one before purchasing it, they were very helpful. This is a great vac, I have tile throughout the first floor of the house and it works great on tile. As in other reviews it is ok on carpeting, and they are right. It is good for a quick spot pick up on carpeting but not a full vacuum. I didn't buy it for carpeting. The suction on this canister is powerful and I would recommend it."
4,hose kinks,"Have had for almost two years. Holding up well. Only complaints are the hose kinks easily (every time I vacuum) and stuff frequently gets stuck at the bent part of the wand (I use a dryer vent brush to remove it - happens every few times I vacuum). Annoying, next time I'd upgrade to one with a sturdier hose, but still works good for a cheap vacuum."
4,Great low-cost vacuum for my hardwood floor,"Having had Eureka Mighty Mite for the last year, I am confident to say it works very well for my hardwood floors. It sucks strong and is easy to clean out. It is a great deal at its price point."
1,Painfully loud!,"Painfully loud! We bought heavy duty ear protection, to wear during use. Unfortunately, the rest of the people in the house were subjected to airplane jet engine level noise. Nice small vacuum, returned."
3,"Love the suction, but they havent perfected the wheels","Love it, but HATE the wheels. I've probably purchase about 4 of these over the years, and they STILL have not made the wheels durable. After about a year or so, the wheels fall off and its a real pain. But its compact and sucks like hell. If they fixed the wheel issue, I would give it 5 stars!"
5,awesome,"I purchased this vacuum to deal w/the floors in my house. The suction is very powerful and actually does a great job on my oriental rugs as well. I had done alot of research on canister vacuums and I am very happy w/the weight, suction ability, and ease of operation w/this one...SO glad I purchased it!"
1,Really Junky-- don't know why it gets good reviews.,"This vacuum did an OK job for the first couple months. Although the suction was decent, the CHEAP plastic hose and CHEAP head nozzle have caused a lot of frustration. Over time, I had to start holding the hose a certain way with one hand to suck anything-- and it's awkward. Also, the way you have to wrap the cord around the device is annoying.I've had my Eureka Boss for three years with not much success. It was a complete waste of $90 and will be going to goodwill for some poor soul to scoop up.You're better off forking over the money for a high-quality Miele canister vacuum. My family have had superior luck with their Miele."
4,Awesome for the money,Mighty Mite is a good name for this vacuum. It has great suction and gets the job done for a price that can't be beat. Why pay substantially more for another canister?
3,little Eureka vacuum cleaner,"The vacuum does well for small vacuuming jobs like windowsills and around the edges of carpets. If you are vacuuming a lot (not recommended for this machine), the bag will fill quickly and must be emptied before any real suction will occur (the same as any other vacuum). The vacuum's hose is inexpensive plastic and care should be taken not to kink it or your vacuum will be ruined. The attachments are useful. The machine will heat up after a period of usage. I recommend a 10 - 20 minute session of vacuuming, and then turn the machine off for a few minutes to ensure it doesn't shut down entirely from overheating. If I had it to do again, I would spend a little more money on a better quality product."
5,Great vacuum for the money paid,I purchased this particular vacuum after reviewing quite a few other ones due to its positive reviews and price. I didn't want to spend a lot as I was reluctantly replacing a more expensive vacuum that had stopped working. This vacuum has great suction which is exactly what I was looking for due to having 3 cats. The hose does feel cheap like other reviews pointed out and can get crimped but when it is fully extended I have few issues overall. I love that this vacuum is light weight and easy to carry-unlike my previous clunkier vacuum.
4,"Very good, but","This vacuum has terrific suction, it is so strong it sticks to solid surfaces, just open the valve to release suction. Main and big complaint is that the tubes and floor attachment are too flimsy. Otherwise it is a great little vacuum for this small travel trailer, might not like product with the flimsy attachments in a larger area to clean."
3,"good vacuum, bad tube","It's a pretty powerful vacuum, as far as I can tell. Within maybe two weeks, the hose developed a tear and became unusable. Now I push it around like a hand vacuum, no attachments. It's still good, but obviously can't do corners, gets a little messy when it's off, and it's a little heavy. I'm having a hard time finding a replacement hose."
4,Replacement for similar product,"Easy to carry upstairs & down. It has a lot of strength for its size! Great for hardwood floors, but harder to do carpets. Angling the wand helps. I don' t have that much carpet to clean, so I'm not that concerned."
2,vacuum rating,"We had a Mighty Mite for thirty years. When it broke down I jumped to buy this product. It does work, but all aspects of this unit are inferior to the original Mighty Might. It was such a blessing in terms of quality. Also, I purchased it for $14.00 when TG&Y; was going out of business in the community we lived in.This product does work, Eureka had set a high standard."
1,Complete disappointment,"Did my research and had such high hopes, but this vacuum is a big disappointment. The unit and accessories appear as described, and it sounds strong and has good suction from the open pipe.Except, not. My house has bare floors and large (9x12) wool or cotton rugs, and 3 cats. After going over the kitchen, I turned around and saw the same onion skin and pet hair just mocking me. Then I spent 20 minutes on the living room rug, and afterwards it looked like only I'd crawled around picking lint by hand. Other gripes: the flexible hose kinks flat/closed (doesn't self correct), the floor tool clogs about every 90 seconds in both brush positions (and must be cleared WITH FINGERS, the debris doesn't suck off by the pipe alone).I don't have the heart to go in to more detail. I'm not sure how I'll get my floors clean with this device. This blew the budget I had to replace a 15 year old, $40, Dirt Devil little red canister (that finally burned out). Harrumph."
4,"made for bare floors, ok for carpets","I bought this because I have bare floors with just a few scatter rugs. It works great on the floors, and is easy to move around, with a very long cord. I would only rate it as adequate on rugs - it works fairy well on low pile, but not well on high piles, and has a very hard time getting cat hair up. The pieces of tube that make up the nozzle have a nasty tendency to separate, and so I have duct-taped them together.Pros: long cord, great on bare floors, light and easy to manouverCons: ability to handle cat hair, deep-piled carpets, tubes don't stay together"
2,"After having it for a while, my opinion has changed.","I may have written a good review for this product when I first got it. I was initially impressed with how much it picked up on my hard wood floors because of the strong suction. However, after having this vacuum for about 6 months now I am completely and totally frustrated with it and cannot wait to buy a new one. My love for the strong suction is completely overshadowed by the fact that it clogs every 5 seconds, which results in a loss of suction and a 10 minute disassembling nightmare to get it unclogged, also leaving anything I might have vacuumed up back on the floor. I was just literally in the middle of vacuuming when I gave up and came to tell everyone else not to get this thing or this will be you completely frustrated in a few months."
3,Mighty Mite,The mm has good sucking power works great on hardwood but not on carpet. It follows you pretty well but you'll notice that the hose is really flimsy and awkward. The power cord is long but I really miss the retractable cord. Also the suction control on the handle is loose and always likes to open up. The bags inside are thin and you can see daylight through most of it. Awkward to store because of the extension tubes. And that's it. I'm sure there are better choices out there.
5,FOR PET OWNERS!!! (So awesome had to change to 5 stars because it is now 2 years old),If you own pets it can really put a damper on vacuuming efforts until now. We have had this vacuum for over a year now. I love this vacuum!!! We have THREE DOGS and ONE CAT this vacuum works wonderfully. Now given we have hardwood floors so for those of you that own carpet I am not sure of the performance. It is lightweight and bags are at every local store. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL HARDWOOD FLOOR PEOPLE W/ or W/out PETS :)Now 2 years later still going strong! The vaccum to me is unbeatable. Since the intial purchase we have bought some pet attachments and we will always have this vacuum (even if it died I would want this exact same vacuum).
3,good for the price,"the 3670G has quite strong suction, good for pet hair. Unit is light and easy to carry. Works very well, but parts seem a little flimsy, wheels seem cheap. Only complaint I really have is that it doesn't have a cord recoil take-up. Good for the price"
3,Ok,You must vacuum over a spot 4 times before it picks up. The main attachment for rugs and floors is not really well designed. There are very few brushes to pick up hairs or fine dirt. It is going to work OK. It is especially for the price but I miss a more substantial vacuum cleaner.
1,Model that was not,"This vacuum cleaner, although advertised by Amazon, does not exist. It was ordered twice from two separate vendors through Amazon, and both vendors sent a different model (the 3670G rather than the 3670A which is listed.)Over a month was spent and the matter has yet to be resolved. The 3670G comes with tools which are inadequate for the job, perhaps in the hope that the purchaser will buy the optional parts for additional money. I will never buy another vacuum cleaner in this manner again because I would never be sure what I would end up with. It also turns out that getting the replacement vacuum bags locally (SF bay area) is a challenge. I would suggest going and buying locally and with lowered expectations."
2,Mighty Mite,"It is light weight, and that's what I wanted, but everything gets caught in the small hose, then the motor strains and gets quite hot.Also it is terrible on rugs. It was so highly recommended to me but wished I had done more research. Have to keep my old heavy klunker because it really cleans my rugs"
1,Don't bother.,The Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum has ridiculously poor suction. Dustbunnies need not fear for their lives if this is all you're armed with with. I'm not too concerned with cheap build quality - it is after all a $63 vacuum - but even at that price I'd expect more. This thing couldn't even suck the crumbs out of my keyboard. It baffles me how such an inferior product gets so many 4- and 5-star ratings. It's a piece of junk and it's going straight back.
3,cheap parts,"I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS! It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT! The on/off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one. Came here to Amazon, marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history (IN 24 HOURS!) BUT...even though the machine itself does a great job, the parts are CHEAP! The hose is not flexible, twists all the time, I wish I had saved the hose from the old one; the electric cord is awful, very stiff, very hard to wrap around the handle, and gets easily tangled in itself. I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just doesn't cut it; next time, I'll get another brand."
4,Good but noisy!,"I purchased this one to replace an older Mighty Mite (> 25 years old) that finally bit the dust (no pun intended). It has great suction power and can be easily pulled behind you. Two downsides though (1) it doesn't come with a crevice tool and (2) it is very noisy, much more so than my old one. I would suggest wearng ear plugs."
5,Excellent Value,"Excellent product, basically the same as the sanitare model, but only less expensive.Would highly recommend based on price and quality."
1,mighty might not mighty at all!,this vacuum was awful. no suction power at all. I want my money back.I used to have the Eureka THE BOSS Mighty Might and that one has great suction power....this one definitely was disappointing product.
4,A great helper,"I am pleased with the cleaning power of the vacuum. It's quite portable, maneuver,and not noisy. Sometimes it would draw the pet hairs from the floors to its surface like a magnet attracting them but they can be easily vacuumed, too."
5,Great price,Great Vacuum - Light weight and powerful! Not replacing but joining one we have had for 30 years and still works great.
5,Excellent Suction,"We've used Mighty Mites for many years to vacuum hair in a veterinary clinic prior to wet mopping. They have good suction and hold up well. The only weakness is lack of a cord strain relief on the bottom. After extended use and flexing, the cord fails where it exits the vacuum cleaner. This requires taking the machine apart and rewiring it."
3,You get what you pay for,"This is an inexpensive vacuum cleaner and this will be evident once you receive your order. I'm not totally unhappy with this purchase since I know that it is a lot cheaper than most of the vacuums being sold out there. In a way, I am relieved that I did not go with the even cheaper vacuums being sold in Amazon. God knows if they'll even be able to clean anything up.If I was going to use this for a long time, I would have returned it. However, we only plan to use it for a few months and we weren't really too keen on getting a top of the line vacuum cleaner that will last for years.For our (very limited) needs, this will do.If you're looking for something strong and long-lasting, I would suggest that you try looking at the more expensive vacuum cleaners."
3,This is my second one in a year.,"I bought this vac because of its size as well as the Eureka name. Well, the first one I had stopped working after 10 months. I bought another hoping I just got a lemon the first time."
1,Looks like a cheap chinese toy,"1) Not retractable power cable. It seems that the manufacturer saved $1.2) A plastic hose which can be easily broken if twisted.3) All parts (including brushes and hose) made from very cheap and stinking plastic.Can't recommend it. The price of this cleaner must be $20 at most. As for me, that was last time when I bought something from Eureka."
2,Weak Blower,"As a vacuum this product is ok. I use it effectively on my car carpeting. I purchased it, however, to use the blower function, so I could ""blow out"" the water in my swimming pool lines. It's much to weak to accomplish this. I had previously used a similar sized Dirt Devil....that effectively did the job."
5,Great Vacuum,What a powerful canister vacuum! I had owned several expensive name brand vacuums over the years & I must say this powerful Mighty Mite is exactly that it advertises. I love it! The suction power is unbelievable! Anyone wanting a great machine at a low price I say buy it. You will be as happy with it as I am. I can't say enough about my Mighty Mite.
1,Mighty Lite Model 3670 Canister Vacuum,"This vacuum has big problems. I noticed black residue on the yellow part of the body where it meets the black. In cleaning it off I decided to wipe the whole thing down. The wheels were very black, and getting in the inside of them as best I could, they were filled with the black residue which looks like graphite. I am a very fussy housekeeper -- we do not wear shoes in the house so the dirt on the vacuum was not from my floors. I periodically washed the vacuum off and always had the residue. I finally found out the problem. Behind the wheels there is a vent where the air blows out -- so the graphite was coming off the motor -- when you are sweeping it comes out there and also the back. What is wrong with this picture -- you are sweeping up dirt and it is throwing it out!"
4,Great Little Vaccum,"The designers have made some thoughtful improvements on an old but popular model which I think will help to make it more durable. Suction power is perfectly adequate, if noisy. I like the easier to release hose nozzle. The bulletproof power on/off switch is integrated with the housing. On the old model, the accessory tools stuck out on clips which, on my unit eventually broke. On this model, the tools nest safely within backside and out of sight. You can't argue with the price-it's cheap. I have two minor complaints, the ac plug does not clip properly to the cord and the now bulky brush attachment does not allow cleaning in corners. Overall, the Mighty Mite is a great value and I'm happy with it."
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"I wasn't looking for a super vacuum, just something that would do a reasonable job. My last Eureka had lasted for years. This one made it three months before the suction stopped. Trying to get it serviced using the warranty is more trouble than it will probably be worth to buy a new one. Very disappointing."
1,"So cheap, it's like a child's toy","This vacuum is ridiculous. My hubby got it for me after reading other reviews. He thought it seemed like a great bargain. It is a prime example of getting what you pay for. Totally useless on carpet and nearly just as useless on hardwood. Tried it out for about 2 minutes and realized that it is the most pathetic vacuum I've ever tried to clean with. Sending it back. Don't waste your time or money. Cheap, lousy product."
1,Lousy,"This is not a vacuum cleaner. This is a cheap plastic toy marketed as one. It's unbalanced, unwieldy, and a general pain to use. Every time I finish vacuuming the apartment I feel like throwing this thing out the fifth story window."
2,one year life!,"It was good for the time when it was working, after one year it retired! I expected it to work for at least two years for the price I paid. come on! now I don't trust vacuums any more but I still need one for easier cleaning because I'm pretty busy and don't like the flying dust caused by a broom; so now I decided to get a cheap vacuum to work around a year or so, then I'll be satisfied."
4,Love!!! but....,I love my little vacuum but it seems like the extensions that make the hose longer keep falling off. I'm constantly putting them back and it gets a little frustrating after awhile. Otherwise it's a great size!
5,Great little vacuum.,"We got this to replace the Eureka canister vac my wife and I got 34 years ago. That one still runs, but it's getting kind of beat up. This new one is lighter, has better storage for attachments and cord, a better bag layout and easier accessed switch. I've used it to clean up after some repair projects around the house this month and it works great! No, it doesn't replace an upright but will be great for stairs, corners, car and etc. Super handy and well designed. Let's see, if this one lasts 34 years too I'll be 91. That should do it!"
4,good purchase,"I am pleased with my Mighty Mite vacuum. It has plenty of power for my bare floors and low pile carpets. It's easy to maneuver, altho the foot on wheels takes a little getting used to after my previous one that just slid on the floor. My only complaint is that it is very loud."
4,What suction power!,"If you want a lightweight small canister vacuum with lots of power, purchase this one. It has 12 amps of power and the suction is very strong. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it's plastic parts feels cheap when you first open the box. But I quickly forgot about that when I used it...picks up everything that isn't nailed down."
3,Boss Mighty Mite,This vacuum works well on wood floors and linoleum. It isn't wonderful for my area rugs. I think I may have been happier spending more money for a more all-round vacuum with a retractible cord. I do like the long cord. It lets me vacuum my whole house and the vacuum is nice and light so it has its pluses.
4,My newest little sweeper,"Ages ago, I bought a Mighty Mite and, literally, used it to death. I was very happy to see that they were still available. I really like the new one, it has great suction and is very lightweight. I only wish it had a retractable cord!"
3,Not as good as it used to be,"I chose the Mighty Mite because of previous experience with an older model.I am disappointed with the attachments--the primary reason for buying a canister. The upholstery/dusting attachment is too small to be useful, and I miss the floor brush. The rug/floor attachment picks up sand and grit, but not fine dust.I also was confused about whether the vacuum had HEPA capabilities--and am sorry it does not."
4,Liked the vacuum- HATED the vendor,"This is a decent vacuum cleaner for the price. Eureka has definitely gone away from high quality, though- I have an earlier version of this vacuum, about 10 years old. I had to replace it but am still using the hose from the old machine with the new vac. The new hose is flimsy and kinks easily."
5,Excellent product & service,"This is a very good vacumn cleaner, and I was very impressed about "" No shipping charge "" and received it within a week, My dgt. bought this item locally for around $ 100.00, I got it from Amazon for $ 79.00 and free shipping....Excellent...."
5,THIS VACUUM REALLY SUCKS!!!,"I bought this vacuum because my upright finally died. I have hardwood and vinyl floooing all over the house. This little bugger vacuums better than my upright ever did. In short, it does what I need it to do. ( THIS VACUUM REALLY SUCKS)!!!"
4,Mighty Mite Vacuum,"This is the second Mighty Mite vacuum I purchased at Amazom. They are not quite the same, it is still a great vacuum, but I liked the hose on the first one much better, it had more flex. This hose seems to have more plastic in it so it kinks alittle to much when doing certain jobs. We have five pets so it great on cleaning up the hair and dust. Over all I like the vacuum, not to heavy to carry up or down stairs when cleaning, and the price is great on Amazon. Eureka needed to leave the hose alone."
4,Canister vac,This is a nice little vacuum for laminate floors and some smaller area rugs. It has plenty of suction and the bag seems to hold quite a bit. It's easy to use for floors and with the attachments. I wish it had a longer cord but other than that I have no complaints. It's a great little vac for the price.
4,eureka! i have found it!,"i was looking for a small, light vacuum that i could either carry or roll on the floor, that would be cost-effective for the small amount of use it would get. i finally found it!this vac is light and has good suction. the hand tools and floor attachment are ok for my needs, and the cord is nice and long. my only complaint is that the wands are FLIMSY--you really have to beat them together to make them stable, but what did i expect for th 69 bucks i paid for this open-carton model?i wanted this for around the edges and quick clean-up, and i have been very happy with this vac. the bags are not sold just anywhere, however, so if you can get them online for around $3/pkg, you might think about adding them to your order. i did find some at my local k-mart, other posts have mentioned wal-mart, but they don't stock them here in bellingham."
5,Very pleased,"Absolutely love my Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum!The suction is great, unbelievable. Now I remember why I loved canister vacs more than uprights.The plastic hose got kinked once and didn't crack.I give it 5 stars but I just wish they made them with the old style cloth hoses. Plastic ones make my nervous."
3,Good Suction,"Very loud not so sure how safe it is on my ears, but does a good job and is light enough to do smaller jobs."
3,Eureka vac,"This is a very poor vac. I wouldn't buy again,. Very cheaply made, light weight,afraid it will break.Would rather have an upright.Will say that it has good suction."
4,Satisfied so far,"I've had one of these for a couple of months and so far, so good. It is loud but tolerable. I think the bags are easy to change -- as with most vacuums, I recommend not waiting until a bag is overfull or things get messy. The long hose is good for reaching under things but makes it a bit of a pain to store. I think the plastic it is made of is a bit cheap and I wonder if it will hold up over time. I didn't want to spend a lot though and think it's a good product for the price."
2,It does the job mostly,"I am a college student on a budget, and got this for my apartment. I felt pretty bad as I feel like the term canister is misleading...this is a BAG vaccuum. I had a suspicion this was the case but the product description skillfully led me to believe that there was just a canister part you empty out. Nope, it's a bag.The suction is average. The wheels on the part that is the floor/carpet attachment are such poor quality they leave marks on my hardwood. I often have to run over a scrap of paper 2-3 times before it is suctioned in.I got this because hey, $60 is a bargain. But a vacuum is something you need to maintain a clean environment, and that is something I value more than my roommate at least. I'd definitely shell out for something more expensive if I had to buy another one (and probably will soon, after a normal use in a medium apartment...this thing is hot enough to cook breakfast on. Feel it's only a matter of time before the motor burns out."
2,Not what I expected.,"This vacuum was highly recommended to me by a cleaning lady that I decided not to hire. I have one cat and I use recycled newspaper litter. When I vacuum the litter that ends up on the floor and turn the vacuum off, pieces of litter fall out of the hose. I cannot use the attachments since the vacuum seems to have less suction power. When I do use the attachments, even more litter falls out of the hose when I turn the vacuum off. I replaced my older Dyson with this more compact vacuum. I guess I should've kept the big and bulky Dyson that I gave away."
3,Great Subsituaute for a ShopVac.,"It's loud, awkward to move, and it really, REALLY sucks. Good luck keeping a carpet or couch cushion down when using this sweeper, but because of the bag system, it can get ANYTHING stuck from behind a stove or fridge. I wish I just got a ShopVac."
1,Scam company,The Boss Mighty Mite is what I ordered and what I thought I was getting but instead they sent the basic Mighty Mite. I sent it back and I still haven't received the correct vacuum yet
3,Compact with good suction but hot,"I purchased this product because i wanted something inexpensive and lightweight that had enough power to pick up fine dust and dirt in a studio apartment. It is light enough that I carry it while vacuuming as my apartment is crowded with furniture and wheeling a vacuum is difficult. It has good suction power. However, the reviews noted below are correct about the heat. It gets very hot, very soon. It is fine for my studio apartment or a single room but I'm not sure I would purchase this for more than 30 minutes worth of vacuuming. I don't know if the motor getting so hot is indicative of a short life span since I've only had it for one month but I figured since it was so cheap it was not as big a deal."
1,Piece of Junk,"Very flimsy, the plastic extensions cracked right away!! Does not wheel good and poor suction Going right back to amazon."
2,"Poor suction, awful brush and tube","In short, don't buy it. The suction is very poor because of horribly-made hose and plastic tube. The power of the motor is about 1300 Watts, but I very seriously doubt that even half of that power works to clean dirt. Air leaks are really bad: hose to canister connection, hose to tube connection, tube interconnection, tube to brush connection. Tubes are made of cheap plastic and are wobbling all the time no matter how hard I'm trying to push one into another (and I'm a strong guy BTW).This vacuum cleaner is unable to pick crumbles and hairs from the crevices in a carpet. Canister is quite unsteerable. Brush allows translational movement only. Why 2 stars, not one? Because it was really cheap. But seriously, don't buy it."
3,Helpful,This little machine has a great deal of suction so it does work well on both my travertine and hard wood floors. I am disappointed that it is a pretty light weight plastic so not sure how long the attachments will last. I was in my local big box store today and saw what must be the new generation of this product which did seem a little more sturdy and the floor attachment had a brush along the surface which this model does not have. That is a negative on hardwood floors as it may cause scratches.
5,Great vacuum,This is a great vacuum. Its light & easy to maneuver. Works wonderful on wood floors and I love the attachments. So far no complaints.
3,"Pretty good overall, very good for the price","The Eureka Mighty Mite is made in China.I bought mine from Amazon in September 2011, so just over a year ago. It has very good suction, and it is cheap. The attachments aren't very effective, but overall, it is a pretty good vacuum. I have a golden retriever, so the vacuum is a little overmatched, but considering it is about $60, I have no complaints whatsoever.I did just buy a more expensive vacuum, which is much better. Mighty Mite is now my teams backup QB. I hope I don't need to use him, but I am confident that if our number 1 goes down with an injury the Mighty Mite knows the playbook, and can perform capably under center.Go Bears!"
3,Reaaly Sucks Up The Dirt,"Well at first glance it is not the best made unit. Plastic hose, plastic everything! However, this is a very light weight unit that cleans bare floors very well. The power even thru the long hose is good. The cost and performance are very acceptable. There are not very many canister type vacuum's on the market and my wife wanted to be able to reach under the tables and beds without unhooking the hose and adding attachments. This does the job. If you have wood floors and pets this is the vacuum for you. It Works"
4,Like it,Great vacuum for the low price. It's a little loud and looks cheap but more important is that vacuums very nice because it has a great suction. I like it a lot!!
5,A mightly purchase.,"It has a lot of power for such a small and light machine. It is easy to get out and do a quick clean up of barefloors. Because of it's size and weight, it can easily be taken up and down stairs. Anything that makes housework easier is a happy addition to this home."
4,Great Vac for the money,"My law office is 2,000 square feet of carpeted and tiled floors. We have an upright and a steam vac for the carpets and they do fine. I bought this 3670G 12 amp Eureka mainly for the tiled floors, cleaning the drapes and (because of its long wands) hard to reach places behind desks and work tables. I am very pleased with it. It uses bags, but that is a good feature for us as we like bags when pulling up dust and dust mites (the bags are cheap as I just bought 24 for $12). I do not recommend this vacuum for carpets in general because the large attachment you see in the photo is not a brush attachment (it does come with a smaller brush attachment for drapes and hard to reach spots). But for sucking up loose junk on tile and in between tiles it is great. It is also great for cleaning drapes (floor to ceiling) and hard to reach spots because of the long wand extensions. Would buy again if needed. 4 stars"
5,WOW!!!!,TWELVE amps of power!!I said TWELVE AMPS!!! Handy. Light. Well designed. Simple. Attractive. Solidly built. If you have only owned a little dirt devil then you will NOT believe how awesome this little vac. is. GET IT!!
1,Poor suction and flimsy plastic material,"I'm very disappointed by the Eureka 12 Amps Boss Mighty Mite Canister Vacuum Cleaner and don't understand why it gets these high ratings on here. When I bought this I knew it was not going to be the best vacuum cleaner because of the price, but the suction is so poor it is just worthless. It leaves most dirt behind because of its poor suction. The straight wand and floor nozzle are made of a very flimsy and light plastic material that make using it a real challenge. The floor nozzle has tiny plastic wheels that don't roll well on carpet. I've always had canister vacuum cleaners with metal wands and more substantial nozzles before this and I just don't understand why this company decided to make it plastic. I advise anyone to spend a little more on a better vacuum cleaner than this piece of junk. It is anything but 'mighty'."
4,Mighty Mite delivers,"Lightweight and powerful, this vacuum delivers as advertised. I use it for both bare floors and carpet with satisfactory results. My only criticism, the plastic wand is a bit on the cheap side but taken as a whole this machine is well worth the money."
4,Terrific Book,"This is an excellent account of the War in France, accounting for virtually all aspects of that battle in World War II. It is a perfect level of detail, neither too much nor too little. The only drawback is that it is woefully short of maps. I purchased a copy of the Michelin World War II map to use while I read the book and this made it easily comprehensible. You also could use the West Point World War II maps volume. Either way, get the book and a map and prepare to enjoy yourself."
3,Good -- but could have been better,"Duel for France is a solid narrative of the events of 1944, from the Normandy beaches to the very borders of Nazi Germany. The German and Allied perspectives are both represented, and the book is richly detailed. The work is hindered, however, by a lack of endnotes, some questionable grammar, and a writing style that is somtimes sluggish, sometimes rushed. Perhaps the most glaring defect is the book's near total reluctance to discuss, in any real depth, the naval and air aspects of the invasion and subsequent operations. That said, Duel for France is still a good read for those interested in D-Day and the liberation of France."
2,Don't waste your money on this one.,"Ridiculous plot with many holes. The ""supernatural element"" of this book was distracting and didn't make sense. Needed a good editor- ""to"" many misspelled ""wards"", too many repeated ideas, plot holes that could have been fixed."
2,"Great beginning, Okay ending","This book is a strange mix. The scenes in the beginning in the hospital are quite chilling and original. However, the ending was very predictable and felt quite rushed. With obvious inspiration from The Silence of the Lambs, there really isn't anything new here. It's a fun, quick read, but if you want a truly chilling and intelligent read, check out thriller writer Kevin O'Brien. His work has much more research behind it and more believable on all accounts. I'm perplexed why people are giving this 5 stars... If you think this is a perfect book, you need to read more."
3,"The gargon at her surgical best, is simply mediocre","After having read this book, I look back and wonder what it was about the cover that motivated me to read this story. The start of the book went from topic to topic making it somewhat difficult to grab hold of the story line. As the book slowly progresses, the storyline eventually grabs hold. The plot, however interesting and chilling, loses all its credibility in the simple fact that some of the horrific scenes detailed could not possibly come to life. For example, the murders in the cottage in which Agnes kills two teens , showers, changes clothes and is out in a matter of minutes while her accomplace is arrested. I have given this particular book three stars as it is a good read if one does not give the story too much credulance. One only needs to check his/her windows and doors once before sitting down on a cold winter's night to read this book."
3,Gory,I'm a pretty big fan of murder mystery and supernatural scary mysteries but this one was actually a bit too gory for me. If you like very explicit details of torture and gory descriptions this is your book. I thought I could handle it but I stopped reading a quarter of the way through. It's a shame because otherwise the story was interesting.
2,Nice try.,Edgar Rice Burroughs' son attempts to write like his famous father and comes up way short.
1,Tortue to watch...,"This series sucks, with a capital S. I find the episodes empty, with no real lessons at heart, the characters extremely obnoxious, and the animation poor, and cheesy. The story, or plot is always poorly written, and is always the same. battle some computer virus in each episode. Bla bla bla... CAPCOM just created some crappy series that fed off of the reputation of the excellent video games. it's basically a cheesy 'ad' for the games. Don't watch it, if anything better to do. You'll save yourself from an hour of boredom."
1,Do NOT Watch the Series!,"The series sucks. It always follows the exact same story line. Lan and his freakishly bulbous 'netnavi' keep discovering weirdo computer viruses. Then they find a wannabe 'bad guy'. Then they battle the wannabe 'bad guy' with no difficulty, and they always win. That's the story of each and every episode. Play the CAPCOM games instead."
1,DIE MEGAMAN!,"WOW! I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THAT FREAKING BLUE PIECE OF COMPUTER DATA TRASH DIES, OR GETS DELETED PERMANENTLY. AND KILL TAHT LAN AND MAYLOU TOO! AND THAT YAI AYANO! MAN, I HATE THAT LITTLE *****!"
4,Sunday Times Delight,No better way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday morning than with my Kindle edition of the Sunday Times. Affordable and superbly entertaining!
2,no pics,I miss the ability to flick thro' the pages v's what i have to do now having to go down the menus and back up. I also miss most of the pictures.
4,British quality,"I purchase The Times and Sunday Times from time to time. In spite of the fact, that I'm not 100 % regular reader I'm very satisfied with the style of writing, with depth of information and ""colourfulness"" of this newspaper."
1,Sunday Times impossible to read!,"Living abroad, sometimes it's nice to sit back and read the Sunday papers ... So, today I downloaded the Sunday Times to my Kindle, it's not too expensive - $1.49...The reason I write in this review section is that it's impossible to find a way to email Amazon to tell them that every time I open a page to read the Kindle, after a few seconds it goes into a kind of updating mode - standby mode with a window showing a supposedly uploading of something.Then the menu page comes back and it looks like The Sunday Times hasn't even been looked at yet.It's not the Kindle because any other books etc work just fine!All I want is either an explanation as to why, or to be refunded. I can cancel the paper, but doesn't look like I'd be refunded. It's not much money, but it's the principle, I can't read it!Anyone know what to do?"
3,Not Bad....but...,"I live in the UK and use the kindle most days. I've been trying out the Times subscription for a while, but i find it lacks a little something. What is that? Pictures. I think the times is a great idea on the kindle, but with the lack of pictures and tables it just lacks that final bit. Is this ""the times"" that is not driving the pictures/tables out of their CMS system ? If it is - come on news international, i think you need to start deliverying the pictures as it helps with the experience and engages your audience. I've downloaded books with tables/pictures in them and it adds to the experience. The times images are normally high quality so lets get 'em on the kindle as i might stick with the subscription and tell my friends.....oh and when i mean the pictures, i mean photo's/tables and the great cartoons that are feature."
1,Not worth the money when the website is free,"I have trialled this now for about a month. The content was fine and the delivery was seamless. However, for a UK subscriber this costs $22.99 per month vs US at $9.99 per month! This just seems farcical to me, especially given The Times website on my iphone is free, more detailed and updated during the day.I'm afraid I just cannot see the point of this for anyone that can access the internet. Very disappointing."
1,Bad UK Service,The quality of the journalism is good and I especially like reading the business section on my Kindle however why do UK users pay more? Why can we not get pictures in the UK? and why since moving my account to amazon.co.uk I now cannot get this subscription at all as it doesn't seem available on amazon UK - Why?I love Kindle but there needs to be better product care - this could gain you a lot more subscribers. For 12 GBP or so a month I would get this paper even though Ipad version is only 10 GBP. Thanks
3,"Good news, but too late.","I've never been interested in news, but when my father and I drove to England due to the volcnaic ash we figured that The Times would be a nice way to stay up to date.I'm still not done with the 14-day trial, but I am probably stopping it before it's done. The problem is that in the morning I do not get the paper before I have to go to school. I don't even get it before school starts.Another problem I find is that tables and such are included, but only the text, so what you see is a listing without punctuatin, making it impossible to know exactly what you are reading.On the positive side The Times has really good writers, making the news easy to comprehend and interesting to read. If I could get the paper earlier in the morning I would consider subscribing, and if they also added the possibility of tables and black-and-white pictures or illustrations."
1,Expensive and not so good,"I was looking forward receiving my Sunday Times on my Kindle every week. But especially the Sunday Times is lacking sections and extra magazined.The subscription is also twice as much as for the US customers and for this price you get even less pictures.I now switched toReuters, which is less expensive, contains pictures and is delivered every day."
3,My favourite newspaper online...,"The content is as expected having bought The Sunday Times for many years. The index is good making it easy to move about the newspaper, obviously very important. Living overseas it has been excellent to be able to obtain it in minutes.However, I am critical of the occasional spelling and layout mistakes, often the same heading appears two or three times with large spaces inbetween. I cannot understand why the journalist's names are not more commonly credited-surely this is essential in a newspaper? Also, more photographs would be appreciated, although I understand that there might be technical difficulties relating to this.At present I would not give the digital publication more than three stars and on occasion might give less."
2,Just not good enough ...,"Having no laptop in Spain and preferring the UK edition to the truncated international print version, I buy the Kindle version of The Times here. But, I am at a loss to understand why it is so shabby. The Times has spent a fortune creating and trumpeting its new website so that it can charge for content (which is fair enough) but it sends a vastly inferior product to paying Kindle customers ... I could live with no pictures; I could live with no supplements (although I am not sure why I should) but, oh! those terrible formatting errors... it is virtually unreadable. Come on, The Times and Kindle - get your act together. Two world class products deserve better of each other."
2,"good content but ""flawed"" digital version",I have been trying the kindle subscription for almost 2 weeks now and so far every single edition has at least one article that is either capital/lower case inverted or with words not separated properly for the whole article. Really disappointed with the layout of the digital version and since it has been being around for quite some time now and they still haven't sorted that out is just wrong.
1,Lack of pictures and European price sucks,"I live in Europe. I don't have kindle, but loved to read kindle magazines & newspapers from pc-screen. I would like to have Pictures in newspaper as well have the similar prices as US customers. Please."
2,Main paper only,"The Kindle version doesn't include any of the Saturday or Sunday supplements, which is frustrating. It seems strange that you can get more on the Web for free, than you can get by paying for the Kindle version."
2,"Love the Times, hate the formatting errors","I have long enjoyed the Times, especially on Sunday. It remains the very antithesis of the London tabloid papers and has none of the shrillness of The Guardian. Unfortunately, the Kindle edition is very annoying to read as a consequence of the numerous errors in formatting. Paragraphs start mid-sentence, subtitles are handled as sentences, and some articles simply end in the middle. Inevitably, this goes from tiresome to unbearable. Canceled my sub while still in the trial period. It does not take too long to get too annoying."
1,Disappointingly poor quality,"I signed up for a Kindle trial edition of the Times, anticipating an entertaining, reasonably informative read (despite the Murdochian influence).What I found was an electronic publication that suffers from shockingly bad execution of basic news copy mechanics. On more than several occasions, I found a paragraph from an altogether different article landing incongruously in the article I was trying to read. So much for continuity. In addition, there were numerous copy editing errors. It's as if an early, pre-press edition of the paper were slapped together to make a deadline. I wouldn't tolerate this from an effete suburban newsweekly, and certainly will not from what is touted as a flagship international title.Unlike the web, the name of the game with the reading experience on the Kindle is prose, with nominal intrusion of graphics and photography. Unfortunately, the execution of the Times on the Kindle loses this game in disappointing fashion."
3,I enjoy the ease of receiving news in English but....,"How wonderful to receive news in my Tuscan in English. But I found articles with two or three words all run together, not once or twice, but continuously.. No proof reading. What a shame."
4,Excellent Sampling From 1964,"A great CD containing many familiar songs, plus the addition of a great song I'd never heard before (a #7 chart hit called ""Talk Back Trembling Lips"" by Johnny Tillotson). Too often oldies stations play the same rotation over and over, and CD compliations frequently contain the same songs as well, so I recommend any of the Rock On 1960's CDs for the refreshing out-of-the-ordinary song or two!"
5,Demolishes dating deception,"This thoroughly documented study (>500 references) demonstrates the faulty assumptions and special pleading behind much radiometric 'dating'. The book even deals with supposedly foolproof methods such as 'isochron' plots, as well as disproving the myth that different dating methods agree and provide independent checks. Much of the book is technical but well worth the study.Even for the non-technical reader, the first chapter provides excellent training for one's ""baloney detector"". It was helpful to examine several fallacious argument styles, e.g. CDMBM [Credit Dating Method (for alleged successes); Blame Nature (for proven failures] = heads I win, tails you lose; ATM [Appeal To Marginalization] which paints contrary evidence as rarer than it is; and ATT [Appeal To Technicalities] which rejects a date contrary to expectations on a technicality discovered after the fact."
1,Barely used it already fell apart,Just got in my car this morning and I a noticed my charger was already falling apart even though I haven't really owned it that long and have only used it about 7 - 10 times. I knew it seemed a little too inexpensive because it appears to be low quality.
2,Works great as long as you don't move,"I've been using this ""upgrade"" for a few months and it just started to turn off by itself whenever the Maglite gets bumped or moved. Very frustrating. Otherwise, I'm impressed with how much longer the batteries last and how bright the light is"
1,I ordered the combo,"I ordered the upgrade kit expecting the led upgrade kit with the tail cap as shown in the picture, but all that was sent to me was the led part. The picture of the item didn't match the product received... always a bummer."
2,not so great,"Save your mony and get something else. That the greatest series. Very B rated, but ok if your really really bored"
1,NOT what I expected,"I thought this was another vampire series, but it is all different short stories. VERY explicit adult situations, did not like. There was only one vampire story"
3,"Cool, but doesn't quite live up to expectations","Lava Bubbles is a cool concept, but doesn't quite live up to my expectations. Being someone who's always been into psychedelic and relaxing things, I was really looking forward to seeing this on my big screen TV. Unfortunately, the image quality of the lava flowing on the screen is slighty grainy or pixelated, so the ""realness"" factor isn't there. Luckily, I have WinDVD which is one of the only programs that can upscale the graphics/images, so I'm able to clean up the look of the lava to the point where it's near impossible to really notice the pixelation that would normally be there.If you have a DVD player that can upscale it, or if you have software like WinDVD to upscale it, I would say it's worth the money. If not, and you wouldn't be happy looking at pixelated lava bubbles, I would say don't waste your money."
1,KATELAND,"I found LAVA BUBBLES to be nasty, and just ghastly to watch. It was almost my worst nightmare. There was no sound at all. And no music either. Just these nasty alien looking things, floating about inside my plasma screen and freaking me out. As i watched for a very short time, i saw this lava stuff slowly takeing shape into HIDEOUS things. I saw Breasts, and Embryos, also Maggots,and Buttocks. A most unpleasurable experience for me in deed."
3,Not bad if you're convinced already,"This book is certainly not bad - it does provide some insight and practical advice for preaching to a postmodern world, and, in this way, may be helpful. My main criticism is that all of the (foot)notes quote other Evangelicals about their analyses and perspectives of postmodernism without letting postmodernists speak for themselves on the matter. Accordingly, this book may be a good introduction for someone who knows nothing about postmodernism and for someone who has an Evangelical background, but it is rather superficial and stereotypical in its presentation. If your primary exposure to postmodernism is from reading this book, you will not learn how to think as postmodernists think, you will learn only how some Evangelicals believe postmodernists think. For a non-religious, concise, and insightful approach, I highly recommend Christopher Butler's ""Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction,"" published by Oxford University Press."
5,Fantastic insight on how to relate to a generation,"I read Preaching to a Postmodern World as part of the curriculum for a class I took for my M.Th.It definitely takes more of an ideological approach to ""Postmodern Preaching"" as opposed to systematic... so don't think it's going to give you a step by step explanation on how to ""preach""... But I did find this book to be thought provoking and insightful. As a pastor, I'm always asking myself how I can be an engaging and empowering leader/speaker... And this book offers a lot on insight on how to effectively do just that.If we are ever going to reach the next generation, it's important to understand where they are coming from, how they think, and how we can best relate and engage their culture... And I believe this book offers poignant insights into doing just that."
4,Postmodern Preachers,Great resource for thinking through communication to today's culture. This book goes much deeper than most other books on the subject. Most books push technology and short sound bite type sermons. Johnston takes the reader past this to see the underlying thought processes of the postmodern listener.Johnston also supplies a chapter on defining post modernism that is one of the best descriptions available. This chapter by itself would make this book worth reading.
2,Not wonderful,"Each drawing looks too much like the next to appeal to a child that young, and the writing is also above the head of a youngster. An older child would prefer a more grown up book."
4,2nd Graders review the book!,This book is a guide to find the perfect rock friend. A girl shares here experience and knowledge about rock hunting. We liked the illustrations expecially the animal pictures hidden in the rocks. This book inspired us to find our own rock friends...
4,"I like the book illustrations & content, but...","I was given a nice paperback version of this (8""x10"") and decided to order one for a friend. But the one I ordered turned out to be tiny (maybe 5"" square?) and printed on substandard paper -- more like newsprint."
3,Rare Juvenile Delinquent Feature Finally Gets a DVD Release,"This Filmgroup release features John Brinkley as a young man whose father is killed in a robbery. He joins forces with the T-Bird gang in order to exact revenge on the killers. Some of the performances are a bit rough, but Ed Nelson as the leader of the T-Bird gang, and John Brinkley both put on a good show. Brinkley, who seemed to make a career of appearing in these juvenile melodramas, also co-wrote the screenplay along with his co-star Tony Miller. The low budget show throughout the film but it generally holds the viewers interest and for the price this is a hard DVD to pass up!"
2,Disappointing even at the price,"I picked this DVD up cause I like the 50s JD stuff and figured I couldn't go wrong at the price. Well, the movie itself isn't disappointing, but the DVD quality is lacking. The image overall is very soft, like a poor quality EP mode VHS tape, and quite dark, especially in the night scenes. If you're desperate to see every JD epic ever made, go for it. If you're looking for a quality addition to your movie library I would have to say pass on this one, even at the price (although in perspective it's not as bad as some Madacy and Diamond discs I've seen in the same price range). The star rating is for the DVD, the movie would get about a 3 or 4."
1,Flattery will get you on the best seller list.,"The first sentence is ""Liberals love to boast that they are not `religious,' which is what one would expect to hear from the state-sanctioned religion."" Now, I've never heard a liberal boast that they weren't religious. Have you ever heard a liberal boast that they weren't religious? Boast? I know a few liberals who aren't religious, but none of them boast about it. Most Amreican liberals are Christians, just because most Americans are Christians. Ann Coulter knows this as well as you and I, so why begin a book with a statement she knows is false? The answer, of course, is that it flatters her readers for them to think that the people who disagree with them are atheistic braggarts."
1,Scary,"I had no idea the woman was THIS crazy! It's scary stuff if people are actually getting behind this sort of mind-set. This is ""Jesus Camp"" scary."
1,Galileo Revisited,"I am an Ann Coulter fan. I love the morality and acid wit that she uses to analyze issues of the day. Unfortunately, her religious faith has led her astray. Catholics painfully learned their lesson from their ludicrous, wrongheaded inquisition of Galileo in the eighteenth century --and thereafter abandoned the Bible as a source for scientific information. It is painful to watch Christians repeat the same dumb mistake about evolution.P.S. I recommend; Nicholas Wade's new book, ""Before the Dawn, Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors."" It is a great read and summarizes what recent science reveals about human evolution. It tweaks liberals on some issues, conservatives on others."
2,What a Shame!,"This book has considerable, but unfulfilled, potential. Ann Coulter is obviously a bright, well-educated person, but her book is so crammed with self-righteous sarcasm (some of it directed against persons the thongs of whose sandals she is not worthy to untie)that her substantive arguments are largely obscured in her attempts to be obnoxious. On page 19, she attempts to describe persons who call Republicans evil. It is actually a description of herself - something like ""filled with a towering, smug self-righteous rage."" In short, the book tells the reader a lot more about Ann Coulter than it does about those whom she attacks."
1,"Not just myopic, but poorly written","If you can get past her xenophobia, you will find a text that is neither concise nor engaging. While the vast majority of what she writes is sensationalism (I don't think she makes many attempts to hide that fact) the leftovers are boring and less than inspiring."
1,LOL,"I had to shave off a few I.Q. point in order to force down this nonsensical crud. If one is to do away with the obvious lies, the whole argument comes apart and really is not worth the time and certainly not the money. Pass on this one."
1,Demonic - The Church of Republicans,"Google: depleted uranium baby, and click ImagesWe have droped over 3000 tons of Depleted Uranium (DU) in Iraq & Afganistan, condemning the citizens and all future generations to grotesque birth defects & disfiguring tumors. What about the terror of a mother who sees what monstrosity she has birthed, or the terror of a mother watching her child grow disfiguring tumors. That is the Bush legacy, and the legacy of our war on terror.Destructuion, chaos, disease, and suffering. What greater hommage to Satan I could not imagine.Ann wants to make us beleive that the war is just and all those who oppose it are unamerican, She and the establishment politicians on both sides who abuse the trust given them are the anti-americans. Thanks for ruining our reputation forever.Thanks Neocons. I will never fly a flag again."
1,Abortion a sacrament?,"""This young lady would do better to travel a few miles outside her cult and see what the world is really like instead of speculating from inside her own power trip...sad really..."
5,Very well written,This is her best book yet. Biting humor and down to earth analysis of people and events. A real eye opener!
3,Interesting,"I agreed with several things discussed in the book and it was worth reading. However, there were times she seemd extremely petty and there were too many personal attacks for example ""rabid widows"" concerning the 9/11, that was unnecessary. That is why I only gave it three stars."
5,Truly outstanding,Ann Coulter is brilliant; her words are cutting at times but painfully true. Bless her for having the courage to speak the truth in a PC charged atmosphere that is destroying free speech.
3,Ms Coulter Strikes Again,"Conservative and very opinionated Ann Coulter in her latest book.Takes a look at topics like Willie Horton and the nutty furlough program that lets killers back out on the streets.Teachers that are overpaid and unqualified to teach our kids and thereby are ruining our educational system.Some democrats and femaleness determination to kill babies by way of abortion and call it something else.These are just some of topics that Ms Coulter taiks about in her book 'Godless'.The book is straight forward,thoughtful and entertaining.And once again Ann Coulter proves herself to be 'A Thorn In The Side' of the lunatic liberals of America.And for that I say thank you to Ms Coulter.This book takes a good look at what's wrong with America."
5,a very gifted soul,"She is one of the most gifted persons i have ever seen. Listen to her talk shows..Is there anybody who can beat her in a debate, even if everybody knows that what she is talking about doesn't make any sense. Look at the way she is making money by selling books those have no intellectual values. That is why i gave her 5 stars because she knows how to sell a book..Ann Coulter is actually a boon for liberals. To support a person like her, you really need a heart made out of steel with a mindset built in prehistoric times. It is going to be tough to find that kind of people because, people are educated and intelligent these days. Her books and talks will make sure that only hardcore conservatives who want to confine their thoughts in the realm created by religion will left with her."
1,Shame on you.....I only wish there was a zero star rating,"I believe that Ann has hit a new low with her new book. I was shocked and felt sorry for the 911 widows, that they had to endure such a painful episode in their life and now to have this written about them. Its just sad....why in the world would you ever say things like this, let alone put them in print?"
1,Not up to scruff,"This is a really lame demonization of liberals. Gist is Liberals = bad, Conseratives = good. Well sure. But it lacks guts and it's not even funny. Reads like it was written by a pantywaist Conservative wanabee, or Rush Limbaugh after a sex change operation and a 10-year heroin addiction. Timid and frigid, although it tries to look factual. But who wants that? Might be okay for impressionable 10-year-olds, but don't waste your money otherwise. You can find Mein Kempf for free at the public library, or start your own local chapter of the Westboro Baptist Church and truly get on the right side of God, y'all."
4,good book,Just reading the critical reviews would be enough to get me to buy this book if I didn't already own it. It is hilarious to read a quote from her book that is dead on and see it being used to discredit her. The inflammatory statements in the book are obviously for entertainment purposes and achieve just that. Enlightened readers will see the humor because of the kernels of truth that is contained. If you don't have some understanding of liberals and their mindset the book won't make sense.
1,MORE HATE FILLED LIES FROM ANN COULTER,"This is lousy book. As always, Ann's lack of wit or humor, and inability to tell the truth makes for an boring read. A must read for anyone that still thinks that anything but lies can come from the fascist right. Hitler would be proud.""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.""--Joseph Geobbels, Hitler's Propaganda Minister"
5,Liberals Nightmare,Another GREAT book by Ann. Liberals hate it but I laughed and scratched my head at their foolishness. Ann has a way with words and covers herself with facts not junk fiction and fairy tales. I HIGHLY recommend Godless!!! If the liberals are knocking it you know it must be GREAT!
5,"Ann Coulter, an American hero","Ann Coulter says all the things most of America are thinking, but are too politically correct and timid to say out loud. Our political correct silence will destroy America if we don't pay more attention. She sparks the debate and God bless her.Our freedom is not free and we must always be prepared to fight for it with words or guns.Larry Moore"
3,Luke 19:27,"""But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them -- bring them here and kill them in front of me."" (19:27)This seems pretty strong. The word translated ""kill"" is Greek katasphazo, ""slaughter, strike down.""[19] The listeners in Jericho RECALLED how King Archelaus slaughtered his enemies, and RECOGNIZED how the parable was true to life.If you're going to quote the Bible...you need to do research on the parables to understand that the words quoted were not commands. Study a little more Greek and Hebrew, honestly."
3,God Bless you Anne!!,"Ann is just like those wunderful nuns in Cathlic school would crack me over the head with a ruler over and over again until I could recite the truth frontwards and backwards.She's doin' her darndest to lead humannity back down the good old tried and true blue path we've gone down a million times before and save the human race. Very nice work Anne!I just hope she finish up her writin soon and start makin them babies like God wants her to, after all that's what wimmen were put on Earth for.I jes love Ann, I gave the book 3 stars because I had some trouble wiht the bigger words."
2,Coult of personality.,"If this person wasn't a leggy blonde who dresses like the town tramp then she wouldn't sell more than 10 books a year. This bawdy shiksa is no conservative, not in a morals or religious sense. But, if conservative is defined as perpetuating the vapid political status quo, then Ann Coulter is certainly a ""conservative."""
1,If you like,"If you like ignorant, arrogant, hatefilled tantrums from a little spoiled blonde who never was refused anything she wanted and never had to grow up and to this day is spoiled and a total brat just like GW Bush, then this is your cup of tea, for the rest of us, it is just another unmitigated cup of crap by republican bigoted churchies."
1,Destructive labelling dehumanizes - an independent's comments,"How does labelling a group of people as ""godless"" help to make the world a better place? Anyone who treats a group of people whose (liberal or conservative) political views differ from his own as ""the other"" runs the great risk of dehumanizing those people. The inherent dangers in the dehumanization of various groups was one of the most important lessons to emerge from the devastation of World War II and we would be loathe to forget it. When I dehumanize others they dehumanize me in return. One cannot escape the boomerang effect of the ill treatment of others."
1,You'd think I would learn,"After reading Coutler's nonsense book ""Treason,"" and after listening to her rants on Fox, I vowed to have nothing to do with this clown or any of her productions. A friend gave me a copy of ""Godless"" and insisted that I read it. I did. There is nothing to this book. It is typical Coulter -- an occasional fact, lifted out of context, misrepresented and lied about -- all followed by page after page of ranting.I hope the Republicans stick Coulter up in front of their 2008 convention -- the American public would turn their back on the Republican Party for a generation after seeing Coulter in action."
2,Missed Her Calling,"Too bad: Anne has a lethal tongue and she could have been an above-average writer for a witty, lethal sitcom. Oh, she is! I forgot! The Bush Administration is a lethal sitcom... and YOU ARE ALL IN IT!Seriously, the girl, eh, uh, drag queen has jugular scribing potential. Too bad, as this book evidences, that's she's just a sell-out, paid-for slug to the neo-con machinery. Satan's slut, no less, and obviously, obliviously, immune to the fact that she sold her (fading) looks and (wasted) wit to the devil."
1,Who believes this stuff? The ones who want to...,"What I find more frightening than someone who says what she says is that how much publicity is made from it.I mean, sure people can believe what she says but she goes ahead and condemns the First Amendment? Uhm...isn't that kinda going against the right for her to say what she...uhm..thinks?And going up against the 911 widows? Poor taste. But it sells.Basically she is the Maryln Manson of the Conservative nutjobs. Saying just enough to cause a frenzy to get her book bought and for her to become rich without changing a damned thing.Any Carney would be proud"
1,don't poison your mind with this book,"This book is self-discrediting, but if you won't take my word for it, please just borrow it from the library. Don't pollute the earth with more copies of this hateful collection of lies."
1,Why can't there be a 0 star choice?,"As far as giving ANY Ann Coulter book ""stars"" - why can't a choice be to give it a black hole?? She is such a vapid, ridiculous excuse of a woman. She is trying to do nothing more than make money, not present facts or reasonable philosophical ideas in any form. She is indeed the Jerry Springer of political writers."
2,"A Concervative's View Of Ann Coulter and ""Godless""","First off I will say that I have not read ALL of the book, so take what I say with a grain of salt. I am a conservative Reagan Republican. I feel that Ann's book ""Godless"" HURTS the conservative cause rather than helps it. When you read some of the text of this book it becomes obvious that Ann is full of anger, hatred, and venom. Her words are abusive and caustic. People lose the point that she is trying to make because they are swallowed up in the deep black pool of her own inner turmoil. I am a Bible believing, church attending member of the religious right, BUT, the anger and hatred in Godless does NOT represent me and the way I feel. My advice to Ann would be: Prozac"
2,Entertaining Rant For Right Wingers,"If you're expecting any kind of rational analysis, this isn't the place to look. But then, if you're going to lay down your money for a book by Ann Coulter, you more than likely already know that. This is full of the usual mischaracterizations, half-truths, hyperbole, and outright untuths that are her hallmark."
1,a sister of a 9/11 victim calls Ann's book a pitiful disgrace,"I almost didn't submit these comments, as I know from teaching that to pay attention to the students who act out is encouraging to them. However, I could not let another moment go by without standing up for the ""Jersey girls"" and other family members of September 11th victims. The things Ann has said and attested about our loved ones (and us) are nauseauting and hateful. I hope you will join me in refusing to read such hate-provoking writing as this. I hope you will spend your time trying to make the world a better place with actions and words, and thereby proving to people like Ann Coulter that vengeful, false words are nothing when compared to acts and words of justice and love."
1,Political Idolatry,"As an admitted Christian, does Ann Coulter in her new book,Godless: The Church of Liberalism, choose to reprove her liberal Christian bretheren on the basis of the teachings of Christ?Nope.Instead, she does so upon the basis of the Left-Right paradigm of American party politics, since she's neither interested in nor qualified to write a measured theological critique, which wouldn't sell very well anyway.In doing so, she has implicitly enshrined the principle that politics and the needs of the State are ascendant over the doctrines of religion. This is Machiavellianism in its purest form, in which religion becomes merely another tool with which to attack one's political enemies.Religion in the service of the State.Political idolatry"
1,"Good manipulation of words, little content","If Coulter's book reveals anything, it's that she is a master of words. Coulter's connotations and tone are witty, yet biting. Unfortunately, unlike her previous books, she has little to say in this one. It's a quick read, kind of funny. But of course, she has become so discredited even in the eyes of many on the right (myself included), that her books are now analagous to Franken's book for the left...a laugh."
4,A thorough and well-documented analysis of liberalism.,"Ann Coulter writes in a most logical and entertaining style, punctuating it with her intellectual and acerbic humor at the most unexpected times. I found my self deeply engrossed in a point she was making only to find myself laughing out loud as she concluded a paragraph with one of her familiar barbs full of delightful satire. The scope of the book is impressive, covering all the major issues that divide liberals and conservatives, from crime to abortion to the best analysis of Darwin's theory of evolution I have ever read. It was an intellectual romp to read and a great resource book for conservatives interested in having cogent reasoning at their fingertips to respond to their liberal critics."
1,"It's sad, really....","The relative popularity of Coulter is a reaffirmation of something the majority of the educated and/or intelligent people in the world see clearly: that the United States is the only developed country on this planet that contains such a large proportion of ignorant, prejudiced, mean-spirited, jingoistic, fundamentalist dolts. Her readers and admirers, in short. Evolution? Global warming? Social safety nets? Any law except one favoring the haves and penalizing the have-nots? Peace instead of war? Tolerance of other victimless lifestyles? Forget them!Given the educational opportunities freely available here, this profound lack of awareness is extraordinary. Well, you can lead a horse to water....I wish the reviewer who professed a desire to marry Ms. Coulter were granted his wish. He would find himself falling into a deep, dark, foul-smelling pit. Recommend glancing at ""Extraordinary Public Delusions and the Madness of Crowds""."
2,Oops!,"I'm a pretty heavy duty conservative Republican, but Ann Coulter's argument that liberalism is a religion and that they are ""Godless"", just doen't ring true and her book does not support the idea. It seems she rushed through this. It also appears she had written a bunch of one liners and thought she'd just fill in the rest with whatever might support the jokes.The worse part is her arguing evolution in almost a third of the book (83 pages). She, or the editor, should have separated this part into it's own book. But that has been successfully done many times, inlcuding by her helper, the author of 'Darwin's Black Box'. She also tries to tie the evoultion argument as if it has anything to do with Howard Dean's brief and loud tirade. Evolutionists are no more all liberal than all Christians are all Republicans. That faulty logic alone tanks the book for me and I highly recommend picking op one of her previous titles instead."
1,"Stick to punditry, Ann","Ann Coulter's treatment of evolutionary biology is very poorly done and uses arguments that have long been refuted by science that it makes her research for the entire book questionable. It is unfortunate that people lack even a basic knowledge of biology, let alone enough expertise to unravel all of the misrepresentations, technical errors, and unscientific misinformation. Thus, it is all too easy for her and her ilk to scare people into thinking that scientists are a sinister clique with nothing better to than to undermine people's moral value systems which couldn't be further from the case."
5,Simply The Best Anti-Liberal Book Around!,"This is probably the funniest and best anti-liberal book around! This is of course conditional. This is of course contingent upon the fact of your personal preferences or beliefs. Are you a liberal? Not so funny! Are you a conservative? A solid factual book describing liberals as only Ann Coulter can! Outrageously funny! A must read for all conservatives and of course liberals, who don't take themselves too seriously. Buy it! Read it! Laugh yourself silly!"
5,FUNNY + SMART = Coulter,This is a laugh out loud book that shows how truly bizarre liberals are. Great gift for anyone you know! Go Ann Go!!
5,Ann Coulter is the Pit Bull of Conservative Reason.,"I not only read this book in less than two hours, I read it again the next day. Ann Coulter seems to have the pulse of the Conservative language and culture as well as the foot on the throats of the Liberals who despise her. She does not hold back, nor should she. I agree with 90% of what she writes and the rest I can still get behind as long as she can take as much as she gives.It is a book worth adding to any Conservative Book collection and is one you can read and refer to over and over again. Top notch writing, quips and factual. I recommend it to anyone who calls themselves a Conservative.Sincerely, SFC Daniel L. Diaz, USA, ret."
3,Ann's Stand on Evolution - Wrong,"I appreciate Ann's taking on liberals and exposing their many hypocracies. But, she loses credibility in dismissing the established science of evolution.Apparently she never heard of bacteria evolving resistance to antibiotics and the infinite mutations of the HIV virus to take only two examples that most people know.Stick to politics Ann, where there is no right or wrong, merely opinions."
1,Worse than usual,I am a person that reads books on both political sides. I am interested on all views but Coulter has reached a point in her career where her statements are overshadowed by her crazy insensitive rantings on people with a different view than her own . This book is crazier than usual. A slow read... The way she slimes everyone is starting to get old. I have done some online research and discovered the plagerism reports appear to be true.
1,"As a Republican, I'm embarrassed","I have voted Republican my whole life. Yet reading this book made me embarrassed. At the risk of being politically incorrect, let me just say that this lady is unbelievably vicious. During these times when people seem to gain popularity based on how divisive they can be, we really have to ask ourselves WWJD. That is why I find the contents of this book to be regrettable and repulsive."
1,Godless and self indulgent,"I am mystified with Ann Coulter's views. It does seem that her fasination with the obvious and her insertion of wit is what I believe sells her books. Nothing more and nothing less will continue to be on her side. Ann is, of course, entitled to her written opinions, however the ""Biblical precepts"" as she mentions are within her own mind and possibly known only to her.I did find a lot of the book to be tumbled with self modifications such as her view on religion and I would like Ann to truthfully defend her plethora misconceptions of disturbing arguments.I cannot find it in myself to stay for another version."
1,"Hate for ""God""?",How could any person be a Christian and be that hateful.The true crazy people are the ones who buy her books.She will never havce kids or be married it's the only way to be that hatefull and judgemental. If she is a good Christian as she would like people to believe she must be a very old virgin correct.Maybe thats her problem with her fellow man.
1,What a wonderful topic!,"Again, as my many fans know, I have NOT read this book, therefore I can bring an unbiased opinion to my review. Why get bogged down with ""she said this"" or ""she meant this"". It's too confusing.Let's just be rational here and start with this premise that we all know to be true: there is no God to be ""godless"" about. Doesn't that make everything much easier?If there was, would he abide by a harpy like Ann? I don't think, from what I've read in the New Testament and from what I've been told by Christians, that Jesus would like Ann very much at all.See? Wasn't that easy?"
1,Coulter is a Douche...,How can a person so ignorant and racist be given so much press? I thought our country had been trying to open up our eyes to racisim more and to try and stop hate. With this new book Coulter hits a new low. She aims her rage instead at Michael Moore to women who lost their husbands in 9/11 and at the liberal agenda. Aiming for below the belt at the liberal population is nothing new for this woman...but aiming her hate at people who have lost their families in 9/11 is disgusting. All Coulter does is call people names and make stupid offensive remarks...like her most recent speech calling John Edwards horribly offensive names. Her publisher and agent should drop her and stop this woman from being able to publicly sell her hate as political opinion. She just needs to get a job on the 700 club and spew her crap to Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. It is a sad day when her books hit the shelves...because you know that someone out there is actually buying them.
1,I'm a liberal but I don't fit Coulter's stereotype,"I couldn't read past the blurb on the outside cover. Coulter had so many sterotypes just in the blurb that I wanted to throw the book at the wall. (Fortunately I just have to return it to the library. I didn't waste my money on this book.) Liberals are this. Liberals are that. Bull. I'm a liberal, but not an extreme liberal. I am pro-life, believe Jesus is our Savior, and find Darwinism silly. I'm also a feminist, believe all religions are equally valid, and our government system that was formed hundreds of years ago simply doesn't work in this modern era. Coulter's stereotypes make her come off as completely ridiculous. And for being such a Christian conservative, why is she showing so much cleavage on the cover? Let them buy the book for your wit, not your lumps."
1,Transvestite with Adam's Apple,"Folks, I have never read a book so fraught with ignorance and blatant disregard for the truth. She clearly has placed her right wing agenda above all else, and gets paid well for her rants because she's made up to look like ""every man's fantasy""... the truth is, Ms. Coulter is a transgender, and she chose to not have her Adam's Apple shaved, as there was a risk it would make her voice sound more masculine.(Hey, if you believe Ann, you'd believe anything!)"
1,Talentless,"The tone and content of this book reveal a very sad picture. Coulter somehow walled off and smothered that part of herself capable of loving others long ago, perhaps at age five.She is a vile, hateful human being so to her it logically follows everybody else is, too - either that or she's jealous. So Coulter stays hidden behind her wall, taking shots. Because she knows she's unlovable she replaced the hunger to be loved with a hunger to be paid attention to."
1,Let's Start with the Cover,"I just wanted to comment about Ann on the cover of her book. What message is she trying to convey subconsciously here? She's dressed like Jane Fonda on one of her aerobics videos. She looks like an aerobics instructor, not an author discussing Godlessness.It should be clear to anyone Ann Coulter is nothing more than entertainment for GOP men, to distract them from their problems in blaming everything wrong in the country on liberals. It's pure entertainment and no one takes Ann Coulter seriously except the most extreme lunatics in the country.I'm also convinced Ann had a sex change operation due to her large adams apple. If you study human anatomy you'll find women do not possess such large adams apples. It's clearly a male trait. I'd say posing as a female with freakish political views that are really from a male based brain is pure acting. Ann Coulter is an actress of the highest degree."
1,Wasted Trees and Glue,"Authors sometimes run out of ideas, but continue to seek monetary reward by publishing, and this book is ""Exhibit A"" for that premise. Blond hair and a black cocktail dress can only get a girl soo far. Come on, Ann, get a wardrobe. Quit with the invective too."
1,THE END,"The Republican ""talking heads"" have become some of the most repulsive creatures in American politics, no less than Michael Moore. Coulter and the Neocons have gutted and dismantled the party of Ronald Reagan- while claiming to be its legitimate heirs.Not true.If you want to read a REAL conservative book, check out WHERE THE RIGHT WENT WRONG by Pat Buchanan. It will help you understand why the Repubs are doomed."
1,This book is not worth buying!,Ann Coulter's not funny. She makes hateful statements like about the 9-11 widows. The scariest thing about her is how many people buy into her hate. I thought we were one nation indivisible.
3,Humor or political commentary,"Although some of the things she says are a little caustic, I thought it was informative. The democrats are very against teaching Christianity in schools, but they have replaced it with their own religion and set of values. Instead of teaching creationism, they demand teaching evolution (which many atheistic scientist agree is not supported by scientific evidence.) There were a lot of other things that were worth reading."
2,No evidence for evolution?,"Ann,FYI - If you're reading this please visit the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History in D.C. They have an exhibit that details the evolution of the horse over 50 million years from a small dog-like creature with paws that lived in the swamp that gradually evolved hoofs, size, and other grass-grazing features as the swamps dried up and were replaced by grasslands. All of the transitionary fossils have been found. To compare the ""horse"" of 50 million years ago to the horse of today one could quite easily classify it as a different species altogether.If this isn't irrefutable evidence for Darwin-style evolution, I don't know what is."
5,Godless: The Church of Liberalism,Fearless Ann Coulter takes on the belief system of the left in her superb verbal form. A must read for anyone who wants to know the real score.
3,Mixed,"I enjoy political satire, of which Ann Coulter is one of the best. For those who can't take their coffee black, this book will bite your teeth!The ""controversial"" chapter 5 read more like a historical footnote. Those who regarded chapter 5 as ""mean spirited"" or ""heartless"" were the type who, as children, volunteered to clean the chalkboard to improve their grades; because they were dumb... or smart- depending on how you look at failure.I knocked off two points for the last four chapter's, which seemed to reiterate each chapter before it. I blazed through chapters 1-7. But, when I hit chapter 8 the book stalled. Ann seems to have a habit of writing weak final chapters (much as she did in her book Slander)."
2,Ann speaks for herself and those he worships. Not people.,"Jesus would not condone such blind, gutless, empty accusations.What's left to say? Treason, slander, godless. Was it not Freud who came up with the psychiatric term ""projectioning""?"
5,"Courageous, excellent book","Based on volume of squealing, Ann Coulter hit the sensitive point with liberals and other socialists. Ann should be commended for her courage. She personifies what is great about this country - willingness and ability of an individual to tell unpleasant truth to a powerful enemy.I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and can fully recommend it to anyone who cares about freedom and western culture.Great job!"
1,"Sad, and hateful spewings from an untreated alcoholic","I feel proud to call myself a ""liberal"", meaning ""free from bigotry...open to new ideas for progress and tolerant of the ideas and behaviors of others"" according to my dictionary. Sadly, this author seems filled with hateful venom toward a number of her fellow Americans.As I understand it, anyone's viewpoint of the world can technically be called a ""religion"" which means in a very broad sense, how they view life. My lifeview is liberal andtechnically, this author is correct in calling ""liberalism"" (or conservatism, or any other ""ism"" a religion, in a very loose sense). She is not very creative, or intelligent or even inflammatory in saying so.Her writing beyond her premise loses all credibility with me. There is nothing there but hate and loathing, sadly. [...] I believe this woman desperately needs help and I will pray that she gets it (from my ""Church of Liberalism!!).[...]"
4,Godless...a little off track?,"While a great read initially, Coulter delves deeply into the controversy of Darwinism and Intelligent Design. I am more well-read on the topic for reading it; however, I was not expecting such an intricate study. The first few chapters are more topical and in the tradition of her previous book. The remainder of the book could double as a junior or senior high school science textbook...straying from the genre of thought-provoking pleasure reading into dry science-fact scholarly reading. This is not to pan the latter-part of the book, but to prepare you for it, as I wish I would have been. Overall, I would (and have) highly recommend this book."
5,It's ok to believe in God and have independent thoughts,"I know that if you are a liberal, you will hate this book. The book lays out in a very organized manner that being a conservative and believing in God is ok - even good for the country. Most people in the US are not liberal and it is time for those people to read that they need to stand up for themselves and don't let the poorly mannered liberals take charge. Being and American does not mean you can be rude, selfish, push people around, and think your beliefs are more important than others."
1,The First Word of the Title Describes the Author,Ann Coulter claims she is a Christian but I thought one of the basic tenets of a Christian is to show compasssion toward others. All I read in her book is pure hatred toward other human beings.
1,Ann Coulter is Godless,"Ann Coulter's moral character is even lower than Fred Phelps. Granted, they both take great joy in taunting and sucker punching the psyches of innocent people who have suffered profound personal tragedies, but Ann Coulter takes it even a step further by cashing in royally on these evil deeds.Ann Coulter is the antithesis of Jesus Christ."
1,What a crock of conservative crap,"It's people like Ann Coulter who create exaggerated stereotypes of people they don't like,(because like Islamic extremists), their headlights are only willing to see one view,(their's). Their mentality tears people apart not unites. Her views turn most normal Americans off of religion when they cross the line and try to dictate their ideology on this society.The facts are; Bush is an idiot and is screwing up this and our kid's generation with one fiasco after another. There's a reason why religion and politics are to remain separate; it's fanatics like Coulter that prove that point!!!"
1,baby registry anyone?,"The fact that you could, in theory, add this item to a baby or wedding registry, is ironic. This book belongs in the same aisle as Mein Kampf or the Autobiography of Malcolm X, you know, the hate aisle. Seriously, there's no way any idea fueled with as much hate as this woman puts on paper should be taken seriously. She's a parody of herself claiming that this group she hates called liberals run away from science(claiming that AIDS discriminates based on anything other than risky sexual activity is a dangerous idea, as is the idea that we should populate until Earth is standing room only and then move on to Mars). Seriously, get over the idea that the words Conservative and Liberal are names to call each other people. Start thinking about whether your ideas help or hurt people. I think saying that the 9/11 widows enjoyed their husbands' deaths hurts people. How about you?"
1,Improve the cover to sell more books,"In today's world it seems that to sell a bottle of wine you simply need a good label. The wine in the bottle is no longer important. Similarly, Ann Coulter doesn't rely on factual or interesting content, she just needs to appear scantily clad on a book cover. Seeing that this book was a flop, I suggest she appear fully unclothed on the cover of her next book. That should spur sales and attract her targer market: uneducated morons.Nothing in this book would stimulate an interesting debate; it just insults the intelligence of anyone who can find Europe on a map. There are plenty of conservative authors who are interesting and intellectually honest. Pat Buchanan, while he may be out of the mainstream on some issues, is quite interesting to read."
5,"But, I'm an ardent fan of the Intelligent, Witty Ann Coulter.","I've read the book and loved it!! I especially loved where She describes how the taxpayers (us) are subsidizing the lefties, i.e., gov'mint schools. But if you think about it, our kids are their only audience!LOL I LOVED THIS BOOK, TOO!!!"
4,Inconvenient Truths,"I have read Ms. Coulter's book and found it to be thought provoking and very humourous. Even funnier are the personal attacks and 'hate speech' accusations of the left. 'Hate speech' is the new code word for anything the liberals find objectionable. Ms. Coulter's points are factual and well documented. Her editorializing on some issues could be arguable but she is well within her rights to do so. The 9/11 widows have jumped into the political arena voluntarily and while I sympathize with their loss, they have made themselves fair game. Their opinions (and Sheehan's) do not automatically become valid because they have suffered personal loss. That is a new liberal strategy that Ann skewers in her book. Overall, well worth the read."
2,Disappointment from a Conservative reader,"Ann Coulter has made her name by making radical statements that few would make. Sometimes she comes out the hero, sometimes she sounds like a moron. Unfortunately, this book is is about 80% foolish. She rarely has facts but uses many opinions. She makes outlandish comments that even I, a moral republican and a economic libertarian, believe are unintelligent and creates more harm then good. Unfortunately, no good thought or inspiration comes from this book."
1,Ann Coulter is an idiot... or is she?,"When I first read the summary of the book I thought: surely this woman is crazy. But then it dawned on me: maybe she is an atheist liberal at heart but has figured out there are far more simple-minded Christians out there willing to spend their hard earned money on the kind of mindless crap she writes then there are intelligent people who would buy books about what she really believes. If this is the case, then she is truly a genius. In that case congratulations Ann!"
1,The Godlessness of Factlessness,"I borrowed this book from a friend and read it and was quite disappointed by the lack of fact checking. I know it's supposed to be a book of opinionated jabs at the left, but at the least she could have made her statements backed up by statistics and factual analysis. I'm glad I didn't buy it, I only like to buy analysis from authors who actually do research on their subjects."
1,People actually read this garbage/.?,"I can sum this lady up in one two syllable word, ""SlimeBall"" typical bureaucratic dis-informational scum...save your money and time..."
1,Polemic Nonsense From Cover to Cover,Why a hateful woman like Ann Coulter has not been slapped with the trout of truth before now I don't know. She continues her toxic lies with truly evil intent. This book is propaganda of the most fascist kind. It is utter horsecrap that perpetuates the theory that conservative fascism will save the reader from certain doom. Ann Coulter is obviously a proponent of hateful divisive political rhetoric who castigates others for their belief as she spreads virulent hypocrisy of her own design. We do not need this sort of divisive hate when America is so desperately in need of cooperation between its citizens.
1,Ramblings of a mad woman,"Ann Coulter ia a loud fowl mouthed hypocrite with too much nerve. I was shocked at her audacity in pointing fingers at the 911 widows. For someone who has an obvious cocaine problem and apparent issues of address and voter fraud, Ann Coulter is an ultra-conservative nut job. America should be ashamed."
4,Average Coulter book,"Good, average Ann Coulter book. I was hoping for a more strident critique of the school system, but this time Coulter actually holds back too much. Book doesn't quite live up to its title. Schools are much worse than she says. She should address this topic in yet another book."
1,Piece of TRASH,I was looking forward to this book until I got it last week. It is a piece of propaganda trash aimed at fueling anger and as a result making money. She sh9ould be ashamed of herself for writing such garbage to sell some books. We should have a moral code for authors that get to pollute our children's minds. Don't waste your hard earned dollar on this trash so the author could buy another trashy mini skirt. Worst read of the decade.
2,Yet another troll. Pay no attention and she'll disappear.,"This book is transparent trolling at its finest. Ya gotcher eye candy on the cover, ya gotcher catchy title making it clear who to hate, and ya gotcher ""rallying cry"" for The Righteous (TM). If it weren't such common drivel---you can find the essential arguments on nearly any Internet discussion board---it might be worth reading just for the novelty.I give the book 2 stars instead of 1 because her histrionic rants are grammatically correct and have proper punctuation. At this point, I think it's really all that one could hope for out of ""Hot Legs"" Coulter."
1,United We Stand?,"Ann Coulter is the Madonna of the book world. She doesn't even believe half the tripe that she writes; she very coldly and calculatedly does it for the MONEY! The real sad ones are the people who lap this stuff up like pigs in poop and make her rich. A sucker born every minute? More like every second nowadays. As the son of a Methodist minister I am offended, but I've seen this kind of hipocrisy all my life. I guess I missed the verse in the bible that says HATE your enemies. One thing I know for sure; this country is and will continue to crumble from the inside as long as half of it's citizenry hates and condemns the other half for differing beliefs instead of simply disagreeing with them. This kind of vitriol approaches facism. DIVIDED WE FALL!"
2,Great Act,"Ann gets one star above minimum for persistance in maintaining a clever persona that is making her quite wealthy. I came away from this and earlier books by Ann wondering how an intelligent person can hold such views and present them in such a mean-spirited fashion. Of cource it is obvious, it sells books. Ann is a very distinct part of the political circus. She very much pisses people off and entertains others. You will not be enlightened but you may be entertained. Now if you read this book and say ""hey, this makes sense"", you may just be retarded."
1,Cruella Deville Strikes Again -- A Woman Possessed by the Devil,"No sane human being should buy or read this diatribe. Anne Coulter is possessed by the devil. Her book is filled with filthy, vile invective against the 9/11 widows and widows and families of America's dead servicemen and women. Coulter is a disgrace to herself, her family, her publisher, the Republican left, and her nation. She should be barred from ever being published as a writer or given any air time on radio, TV, or the Internet. She must be insane to write trash such as this."
3,"Riotous and fun, but Conflict of Visions is better","This is a very fun read as it is so polemical and naughty. But I believe other books are more instructive about liberals (and conservatives) and why they believe what they believe. Thomas Sowell's, ""A Conflict of Visions"" is the classic tome on this topic while other books such as ""What's the Matter with Kansas?"" and those by George Lakoff will be relegated to history's dustbin.When Ann talked about crime in a couple of chapters, I felt transported back to the 70's-80's-early 90's. She made that era so real and alive again... it was worth buying the book to remind myself just how bad things were. In my opinion, it is the best part of the book and you will learn something from those chapters... they aren't just preaching to the choir.(By the way, the Amazon page for this book is funnier than the actual book. Y'all look at the tags at the top and the review by Gen. J.H. Christ! With enemies like these, who needs friends!)"
4,Take a drink from the fire hose.,"Reading or listening to Ann Coulter is like trying to drink from a fire hose. Her regimented logic, rapid fire witticisms and cornucopia of facts are entertaining and educational. With her hard hitting, take no prisoners style, Ann Coulter makes an airtight case that liberal secularism is a religion and evolution is its under girding holy writ. She demonstrates that they require fantastic, illogical and unbelievable miracles in their zeal to defend their religion it is the secularists who deny the evidence of true science in order to defend their position. The liberal will be well educated and the conservative well armed for the debate by this resource."
5,"Read it, THEN comment.","I have actually READ the book, unlike those bashing it. The writing is witty and all in all an enjoyable summer book. Even if you don't agree with her, Ann will have you thinking about liberals and their failed policies. Especially Chapter 2 which exposes left-wing judges and the criminals they release on society to strike again. Heavily footnoted.MUCH funnier than Franken's ""The Truth, (with jokes)"" which had virtually no laughs. Ann's book had me laughing out loud at times."
4,A Natural Entertainer,"Ann Coulter is a dedicated performance artist whose writing reflects the style of her performance art. I find her work very entertaining, but not something to be taken seriously. She says what she does because she likes to rattle cages, but mostly because she likes to make a lot of money. Some people may take exception to just how shes makes this money, but they can't put her down for not knowing how to move books. Recommended light comedy reading.Ann Coulter quote regarding the 9/11 widows: ""I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much."" Look in your bank account, Ann. Then tell me honestly, if you can, who's really enjoying those unfortunate mens' deaths."
1,Liberalism as a religion?,"To claim that ""liberalism"" is a religion proves to the educated reader just how obtuse and stilted this book is. Sadly, its people like Coulter who continue to point out the differences between our two major political parties and are responsible for the ever-present split of our nation. The content of this book is stereotypical, offensive, and deceptive. It may as well be a book that examines the differences between African-Americans and Euro-Americans while proclaiming the superiority of the latter."
1,Not very good,"My wife and I were REALLY dissappointed in this book. We finally gave up after the first chapter.She rambles on and on. She uses a lot of words and terms that the average reader won't know. If you have ever heard her speak on TV, then you know what the book is like. She talks fast and that is conveyed into the book.What is really sad is that she curses in it. For being a ""Christian"" she uses a lot of BAD words.We DO NOT recommend this book at all."
1,this book is dull and selfish,"weak-minded people seem to be so easily titilated by the right-wing bigot who talks with aggresive assurance, and patronises nicer people. Well i prefer nicer people, (I think the Christian God does too). Its a shame so many people are weak in themselves to find selfish unkind people and their philosophies so alluring. Gimps buy books like this."
1,An insult to thoughtful conservatives everywhere,"Culturally illiterate bigots shouldn't publish books like this; it's a waste of otherwise useful paper. Being hateful and mean may be a good way to sell books to the idiot-fringe but it's a sad commentary on Amercian society that her books sell as many copies as they do. If I was a ""conservative"" (which, I'm not), I'd be profoundly embarassed to have Ann Coulter claming to speak for me. She's an insult to thoughful conservatives everywhere."
1,Just love that adam's apple.,"Well Coulter has set the bar to a new low for other rabid conservatives to aim for. Malkin are you listening. Maybe in the her next book in six weeks she will attack the children who had parents die in War with Iraq.I could borrow some of the nasty comments by other reviewers but that would make me as sleazy as Ann. Liberal or conservative, plagiarism is just plain wrong.The only good from this book is that reading it in the bathroom is sure cure for constipation."
1,I'm sorry if you believe this meaningless banter...,"I had to read this book in a class titled ""Issues in Modern America."" Why our proffessor chose a book that does not cite quotes and obviously pulls ideas and theories out of thin air is beyond me...Coulterclaims to be a Christian, yet rips people apart using slander (didn't she write a book about this???) and non-factual quotes, comments, etc. If this is what being a Christian means these days, I do not want to be associated with the term anymore...This book generalizes on so many levels it's not even funny! Ann Coulter proves that there is such a thing as a cold hearted ""christian."" Too bad none of her points can be read as truth b/c of lack of credability. Most of the quotes she cites are from New York Times articles and taken out of contects...she is good at that. I truly hope no one takes this book seriously."
1,Common sense ain't enough,"She's a talented writer in her own way, but she really is unable to back up what she's saying in a scholarly way. Sorry, common sense ain't enough. It's a waste of money."
1,Another diatribe from this frothing lunatic,"I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views. I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven. You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want. Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year."
1,Plagiarist Pundit Pumps Political Platitudes,"The freak show continues, minus wit, wisdom, or any originality. The plagiarism within ""Godless"" has been documented, but few seem surprised enough to care. The resurgence of this pathetic mental case at a high-profile conservative political dinner last night was no surprise, either--nor was her latest dull attack on a significant Democrat. This time it was Senator John Edwards targeted by Ms. Coulter's increasingly bizarre homophoboia.Perhaps someone in her inner circle of sycophants should point out to her royal highness of the massive Adam's Apple and larger ego that Senator Edwards and President Clinton (whom she previously called ""gay"") are both married with children. It makes me believe that there might be a Supreme Being when I realize that--like Rush Limbaugh--Ann Coulter is CHILDLESS. For that we can be thankful."
2,bankable babe,"like a tv dinner, coulter's book offers limited substance and little creativity but does get the job done. chef coulter prepares a dinner that is palatable if predictable. palatable in that the book, regardless of one's political views, is entertaining when going thru coulter's 'unique' perspectives. predictable in that while one may not know exactly what she'll be serving, you can bet it will be far right, far christian and far out."
3,Coulter rages on,"I picked this up at the library since Coulter's books are always good for a laugh. It is filled with inaccuracies, particularly when she takes on evolution in the final chapters. A better read would be ""Icons of Evolution"" by Jonathan Wells or even ""The Politically Incorrect Guide to Evolution and Darwinism"". However, she does make some salient points about the sorry state of democracy today and abortion which she defines as ""the precious right that women have come to depend on, the right to have sex with men they don't want to have children with."""
1,Shameful,"Ann Coulter is self-serving, evil and anti-American. At best she will just say anything to make a buck. At worst, if she really believes what she's saying, she's out to destroy democracy.Either way, don't waste your time with this drivel.In an era when our political discourse has degenerated into playground-level emotional ""poopy-head"" insults, she drags us down to a whole new level.Like it or not, this is a big country and we're all in this experiment in self-government together. Coulter's kind of blind hatred, bigotry and division does nothing but hurt our great democracy.I thank God we live in a country where she is free to espouse her hateful drivel, but please exercise your right not to encourage her by refusing to spend money on this waste of good trees."
1,"""Mein Kampf"" for the 21st Century","I am a Christian. A theologically-orthodox Lutheran. Ann Coulter does not represent my views as a Christian or an American. Ms Coulter, you and your ilk (Limbaugh, Savage, O'Reilly) need to realize that being a Christian does not automatically equate to being a Republican.What Coulter and the others mentioned above seem to advocate scares me: a one-party (Republican) theocratic state. There's something similar to that in Iran.Get this, Coulter's other diatribes, Rush Limbaugh's two self-congratulatory puffed-up BS, and you'll have a ""Mein Kampf"" for the 21st century.I only give this one star because the computer won't allow me to give a negative rating."
1,"Too bitter, too mean.","I've enjoyed some of Coulter's books and talks, but reading this book this time just pushed me over the edge. Ms. Coulter goes too far in her venom against democrats. I'm a registered Republican and I find her comments offensive in this book. She comes off as very bitter.Coulter's become a hypocrite not to complain about Lisa Beamer being used as a political billboard by Bush immediately following 9/11. Is it ok for victims to be political billboards, so long as they advertise for Republicans?"
1,Nuts,"Other people have covered the gross inacuracies and silly, provocative claims in this book, so no need to repeat here. I go to church regularly (Methodist - not really a church, Ann?) and I never thought of myself as a liberal until I moved back to my home state of Oklahoma. Now I wear the label proudly, particularly when being a conservative is defined by such bigoted, brainless books as this."
1,A Republican Blowhard Sells,"While I do agree that the republican side of things wouldn't be so enlightening without the hate-mongering, hypocritical savvy, and downright stupidity towards the left, I do find it quite distasteful that anyone would want to slander anyone directly affected by 9/11. I do hope the wives sue Annie for slander, and that she continue showing proof that conservatism does increase profit for heartburn medications~"
3,Funny!,"One knows whether they've shuffled off various viral educational-system induced liberal values and beliefs when one can read this book and just enjoy it. It's rarely more sarcastic and critical than an episode of Saturday Night Live, so I'm not sure what most people are complaining about here. Even Coulter's weaknesses (she doesn't hold a scientific degree or have such training...and Michael Behe, David Berlinski, and William Dembski obviously didn't help her as much as she might believe) are completely forgivable."
5,"A witty, yet powerful analysis on the ironies in liberalism","Coulter presents the double standards, the out-of-balance judgements, and ironies of liberalism: save a plant, abort humans; hinder human progress without analyzing downstream impacts; denounce abstinence and promote sexual promiscuity while trying to end the AIDS epidemic; etc... Coulter cites scenario after scenario of proof that the liberal mindset is absurd and illogical. She explains how the media with its liberal slant has attempted to publicize and spin these ideologies as something beneficial to our society, while in the next breath degrading God, morality, patriotism, pro-family, and decency. Combining the religion of secularism with the religion of liberalism in the Land of the Offended is the theme of this incredibly entertaining read. This is the first Coulter book I've read. While her TV and publicity antics are a bit over the top, she does well as an author."
1,Paranoid Ranting,"Add this to the growing heap of relentless screed, so full of bile it isn't even funny to make fun of. Personally attacking women who lost their husbands on 9/11 is not ""commentary"", it's the most repulsive form of hate mongering for attention.Does this woman have any friends??? I'm waiting for her to implode into a giant gob of seething, green goo from within."
4,"Read it, then decide","Read it for yourself and then decide. Don't be too influenced by the ""one-star"" crowd. Nor should you be fooled by the ""I'm a conservative and am ashamed"" comments. Nothing in this book is new but it does give an interesting perspective on liberalism as a religion. The ""Jersey Girls"" comments are all that you hear about in the mainstream media. There are plenty of other things in this book that should have the liberals hopping mad. It's an easy one-time read that I will sell online and get about half my money back."
4,"Godless, the Movie","This weekend I read Ann Coulter's ""Godless"". I was expecting a tiresome extension of her weekly column. What I got was the makings of a great movie! It was relentless in demonstrating that liberals are emotional and incapable of predicting the consequences of their actions. But better than that, it was hilarious. The asides and editorial comments cast a blinding light on liberal myopia far better than just a presentation of the facts."
1,Like Looking Through A Not So Fun House Mirror,"I don't think that I am even at the point of disagreeing with the tightly clad author: Ms. Coulter's extremist perspective is so evident in her writings that I cannot say with any certainty that she clearly and plausibily sets out a view that any reader---left, right, or in the middle---could get to the point of evaluating."
1,This would be great if she labeled it fiction,"Thumbs up for expressing her views. It would be nice if you verified her facts and did not alter reality so much. Sure liberals can be fanatical. Funny thing is, liberals don't go around committing acts of terrorism in the name God (e.g. abortion dr. assassinatons) and don't preach a philosophy of ""hate those who are different.""I must say that she held my attention through the whole book. Very comical."
1,Now to become a relic of what could have been an interesting career.,"Recent events, which include what might be called Insults, such as ones I cannot myself use in an Amazon review, now make this author's career, I believe, through logic, to be over. This will remain a relic of some interest to those who want to see her climb towards the top, before the fall."
5,"Fun read, but...","Ann Coulter is a wonderfully engaging writer whom you just can't ignore. Please understand that I am not a fan of hers and I'll explain why below. However, I think she had two aims in writing this book. The first was to enrage liberals. The second was to bring joy to the hearts of her supporters. With Godless, she succeeded brilliantly in achieving those two aims.If you enjoy Ann already, you'll love this book. Guaranteed! If you loathe her, then nothing in this book will cause you to change your mind about her. While I find her entertaining, she falls into the old trap of blaming other people or groups for problems. It's a technique that's been used throughout history.Hitler blamed the Jews for Germany's problems. Donald Rumsfeld blames critics of the war in Iraq for the problems there. I could go on, but I think you get the picture. Instead of blaming liberals, I'd far rather see her wit used to develop solutions instead of sarcasm."
1,More divide and conquer...,"As a self-proclaimed moderate I gave this book a shot, just as I did some of the left-wing books of late. Fact is, this is written to be controversial, not accurate. Why? Controversy sells, accuracy doesn't. Liberals aren't any more ""all Godless"" than conservatives are all Nazis. Like all extremist pundits, Coulter pushes hot buttons as she turns vagueries into conclusions that simply aren't true or accurate. If you read it, approach it as you would Jerry Springer...there for entertainment, not enlightenment. And if you actually do buy into this pop-culture tripe that she spews as fact...well, frankly, I'm not sure if I'm more disappointed or simply surprised that you even know how to read. :-)"
5,HardHitting,"Ann Coulter presents her views on Liberalism with rapid-fire, sharp-witted, well-documented barbs. I would be a very humorous book if it weren't so right-on!The attacks are relentless. The wit is sharp. The targets are exposed. It is no wonder liberals are so much up-in-arms about this book.A very good read (unless you're a liberal!)"
5,Godless: The Church of Liberalism,"Ann nails the truth right between the eyes. This book clearly shows example after example of the ""left"" and the ""religion"" they have constructed that is being promulgated and propogated through our public schools and mainstream media. She speaks of the inconsistencies and illogical thinking of ""liberals"" who have dominated the American political and social landscape for much too long. Ann makes the point that conservatives have the right to speak their mind as much as liberals do. Right on!"
5,Enlightening!,"Outstanding, Ms. Coulter! Not only does this book describe the left's counter-productive predilictions for criminals, immunized messengers, schools that do not teach (because they're too busy with political correctness and brainwashing students with left-liberal doctrine), and self-protecting pet ""scientific"" theories, but it also answers the critical question: why? That is the true message: the reason why the left is so insistent on proselytizing its message of secularism above all else is both enlighteningly, shockingly obvious, and just a little scary. I won't spoil the journey for you; it's better to get there yourself. ;-)Read this book, at least once; you'll be pleased you did."
5,An Entertaining Factual Book,"Ann Coulter nails it with this one. Her sense of humor had me laughing out loud at times. Left wingers don't like to be called out. Coulter not only calls them out, she pounds a permanent 'L' into their foreheads. This is definitely a book I'll read again....and again."
3,Ann Doesn't Need Oprah to Sell,"First I would like to express my sadness to see how this forum provided by Amazon is being used to rant, to disqualify and to spread garbage and hate. If you read the reviews you'll see that 90% of the people ""reviewing"" don't talk about the book and have not read it.As for the controversy. Well, people; nothing sells in America better than controversy. Ann knows it, she has it down. Show up in a couple of TV shows, feed some bait to the masses and BOOM!; your face is over the place and your book is an automatic number one. She has done it before and she will do it again, because sadly enough it works every time.If you are mature enough to see thru the controversy and actually read the book. You'll see that despite farfetched. Ann has her points, and boy does she know how to express them is a way that sparks love or hate."
1,"Not Controversial or interesting, just sad--don't waste time/money","I thought this would book might be insightful, telling, amusing, witty...whatever--it is unpleasant uninteresting trash talk about not very exciting stuff. Counlter is disturbed, but that does not make a good book. Don't buy it--if you must, leaf through it at the libaray--it will be available onthe shelf all summer...trust me"
1,crash and burn,"I usually enjoy Ann's speeches and articles, but this book was terrible. The facts/statistics are streched out and inaccurate. Not worth the money and not worth the time."
2,This chick can write!!!,"Oh my lord, this is a piece of crap. Is it really this easy to sell a book to Republicans?? I felt like I was getting dumber as turned each page. The sad thing is that she is a cool chick who gets smokes cigarettes and gets drunk with Bill Maher. I bet she is a slut."
1,thumbs down,"AC has gone overboard with this book. Her premise is ridiculously lame and unsupported. She is simply striving to get a few more bucks out of her non-thinking supporters.She describes herself as a Christian, but there is nothing Christ-like in her effort.[...]"
3,Super Reader,"This might be getting to be too much of the same thing, as the Laughing Magician basically hits the reset button on Cugel, and Cugel has to repeat the journey of the previous book, at least in geographical terms. This annoys him, of course, so he has to try and come up with plots and plans to gain some measure of revenge. Plenty of screwups here, etc.Because of this, I have never gotten around to the last book."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"Cugel's Saga is the sequel to Eyes of the Overworld. Jack Vance's questionable hero, Cugel, struggles southward to avenge himself upon the Laughing Magician, encountering some of the most inventive situations ever put to paper. Always self-centered and vain to a flaw, Cugel nevertheless is possessed of a cruel and delightful sense of justice. As he wreaks havoc, either intentionally or by blind dumb luck, on the deserving of the world, one cannot help but cheer the miscreant on. Jack Vance is the greatest fantasy writer of our time. This book is part of the Dying Earth series, including The Dying Earth, Eyes of the Overworld, and Rhialto the Marvelous."
5,so funny!,"this book is just so funny. i loved it. every page. every sentence. every bizarre character. i loved Cugel, who is not nice, or successfull, but so damn funny. Cugel is swept away far from his home by an evil wizard and tries to get home. and of course he tries to get rich, fool people and other things. i simply can not help finding it so funny. one of the best books i have ever read.hmm. i know this wasn't a very descriptive review. but i'm counting on that you are reading all the other, long, reviews too. and i know that my english is that of a 12-year old swedish child."
3,Dear Kevin:,"Ten years ago I read A Stranger in This World and thought I'd stumbled on the next Raymond Carver. That book hit me with the force of a semi crushing a soda can on the interstate.Ten years and four books later, I keep wondering, what happened? Yes, Winslow in Love (like his other novels) is filled with poetry in prose, razor sharp condemnations and suicide inspiring introspection. It's a good novel. I liked it. I gave it 3 stars. Still, I can't help thinking that the horse so quick out of the gate came up lame. My ticket ain't worth much now.Read Winslow. I recommend it. But go back and reread Stranger. Apples to oranges or not, you'll find a writer in that volume that delivers not only jabs of poetry, he unloads upper cuts that would make Chekhov proud."
2,Uninteresting and monotonous -- a complete bore,"I read about half of the book and couldn't muster up the energy to open it back up again. The book is quite boring - aside from D's tales on the road with Run DMC. I hardly think that Darryl lives up to be the voice of reason he assumes himself to be. Half of the half I read was spent trying to convince the reader of how ignorant we are to today's rap music and how the state of the industry is at an all time low. Give me a break, please....And those pictures of him are all out completely friggin' stupid."
2,Wolverine's big brain,"During a recent, long travel I took every day around 300 pics and copied them every evening over to the Wolverine; after 6 weeks I still had 35GB of memory available!the Wolverine is a tremendous helpful tool, easy to handle; occasionally it would have been useful to see, which pics I had already copied, however it was just a matter of my own too short memory . . .I am very happy to have it, I had no time to work on my pics and did not want to carry my notebook;"
5,Wolverine +++++++++,I bought the Wolverine to download digital photos daily on my recent trip to New Zealand and Australia....it performed flawlessly....battery life was exceptional....it is a very economical way to backup your irreplaceable photos and takes up very little space....I rate it as a 5 star item
4,WOLVERINE DATA,"Recién lo he comprado. Tenia muchas dudas si comprarlo o no. Por que habia leido en los review, que se demoraba mucho para bajar las fotos.A penas lo compré y después de cargarlo, lo primero que hice fue probarlo. Le meti una tarjeta SD que tenia y le baje las fotos. Me pareció que bajo rapidamente, no es lento ni rapido, podria decir que se demora lo que uno se demora cuando bajas la informacion a la computadora.Me gusta por que es pequeño pero algo pesadito.Lo que mas me gusta de esto, es que te sirve para bajar las fotos de tus tarjetas de memoria sin el uso de una computadora. Es muy útil cuando uno sale de viaje o quizás cuando estés en una reunión y un amigo toma una foto que quisieras, simplemente le pides que te preste la tarjeta y lo bajas en tu wolverine.Lo tengo poco tiempo, así que todavía no le he encontrado algo que no me guste (si es que lo tiene)"
5,Copy photos of yours and of others,"I agree with the majority of reviewers who are very satisfied with this product. I too, purchased it to backup photos when I travel and to reuse my camera memory card. For this purpose, it has worked flawlessly. However, I have found another important use for this device. Recently, I was on a trip with other people most of whom had digital cameras. At the end of the trip, I copied their photos from their camera memory cards to my Wolverine FlashPac, and I took home everyone's photos - theirs and mine."
4,Neat Device,"This is a useful device. It is very simple to use - I didn't need to read the instructions. I charged the battery and then used it on a vacation to upload from a memory stick, reformatting the memory stick to use again. I did this several times. On return home I uploaded from the Wolverine to the computer and all my photos were there intact.A couple of points to note. Although it has a screen for instructions, you can't use it to see photos stored on it like a photo i-pod. When uploading to the Mac it doesn't automatically open i-photo. You have to drag the file but it is no great problem. I have been well pleased so far as I won't have to buy too many memory sticks for vacation. Of course , if you are super cautious. you can simply use it as temporary back-up to the camera memory."
2,Save your money,KitchenAid Stainless Steel Utility TongsThese tongs do not grip the food with security. Not good when you are trying to remove hot food from grease. The holes in the blades do help prevent hot liquids from running down the channel and out the top near the locking device. That is the only redeeming quality about these tongs. Am searching for someone I dislike so I can give these tongs to them.
4,A very good R&B Album,I bought this on vinyl in the late seventies.Don't be fooled this is Lonnie Smith(not to be confused with Lonnie Liston Smith) but a terrific album nonetheless. If your a fan of L.L.Smith you'll probably enjoy this as well. I am and I do.
3,it works,"This filter does the job as expected. I am not so found of the attachable base on the bottom. It make the filter sit crooked in my gravel. I also would change the air tube. I like using an aeration stone, added oxygen in tank, but the little tabs that hold the tubing in place are fragile. The sloping lid makes it hard to keep the poly filter material in place while placing the filter into the tank. Otherwise, this is the kind of filter I was looking for to place in my 10 gallon tank."
1,Cheapest plastic junk I have ever seen,I received it today. The boxes were perfect / no damage. I open the box and the item is broken into pieces. No instructions whatsoever. I didnt know they could make plastic so thin and cheap. Dont buy this piece of china junk. Spend a little more and buy a name brand.
4,make it work like a killer !!!!,dump the air stones and air pumps in the trash ...just put a undergravle powerhead on it and boom!!! you may have to take it to the pet store with you to find one that fits it well or put a undergravle tube over outlet tube on the filter but it will be worry free after that and just use the air set up on the power head
4,Good reading,This is a good book to have in your reference library. We felt it was a little difficult to follow in some instances being a new foster parent.
2,baxckpack,I was disapointed at this product because of the size/ It was much smaller than I thought It is made very well.
5,Excellente protection for the Ipod nano,This is an excellente case because it prevents from any scratches that the ipod could suffer. I think is the best case you could get for the ipod.
3,the spoons are fine but the price is WAY off,"Nothing particularly special or defective about these measuring spoons. They will make a small but nice addition to your KithenAid kitchen. However, the price of $19.99 is double the price that you would pay if you ordered from the KitchenAid website. Also, you consistently can find them for less than a third of Amazon's price at various closeout or discount store."
1,Confusing Book.,This book is not for the beginner. I've read through the first three chapters and I'm still confused on what it's explaining. The first book I used was Learning VC++ in 21 days & this explained in better reproducable detail as to how to make workable code. MFC Development does not explicitly tell you where to put code and the code generated by the class wizard does not look anyway like the code in the examples. I've got more use out of my WROX & Learning VC++ in 21 days books than this one.
3,It's Always Something,"In 1999 I bought the Microsoft CD-ROM of the same name but didn't get around to using it until a few days ago.If the book is anything like the software course, it is well laid out, the examples work, etc etc, but, there is no way on Planet Earth that someone who hasn't used MFC recently (like, the last 7 or 8 years) could learn this material.This course (and probably the book) assumes a level of skill with MFC that almost negates the motive to buy the course (and book.)That is all. I'll return to the course when I have time and after I write the software that is my present goal."
4,Good for beginners/intermediate,"I have read Beginning MFC by Wrox and I find that it does not compare to Mastering MFC Development Using Microsoft Visual C++(r) 6.0. I say this because the latter expects you to know some basics relating to C++ and does not ""baby"" you through useless information. It is well structured and the examples are well explained. If you are getting ready for the Microsoft Certification, use this book as a good reference. It will help you with your general questions as well as your preparation."
4,Yes It does work on Win7,For anyone out there that is thinking of picking this up. It does work on Windows 7. The installation is a little tricky but it does work.To install you must do the following:1. Open cd in explorer window.2. Go to Software folder3. Right click on InstallGB.exe and select properties4. Go to compatability tab5. Select run in Windows XP (SP3) and run as admin press ok6. Go to Intervideo folder7. Do the same for setup.exe8. Go back and run InstallGB.exe9. Plug in device when asked and follow install prompts.Should work just fine now. I had no problems with my install. Worked on the first try. I never was able to get this thing to work properly on XP or Vista due to lack of PC power. Runs beautifully on my Win 7 system. Quality of video capture is nothing to write home about but it does the trick.
3,"Works with Windows 7, but not 64-bit","This product does work with windows 7 and vista, but not the 64-bit versions. In a 64-bit environment, the only way to install this is using vmware or another virtual operating system program to install and run a 32 bit system (guest). Install the Gamebridge to the 32-bit guest system and it works at full speed on a relatively new computer."
3,"Device is good, software sucks.","After hooking up my XBox360 on this, the best capture size on the default software is just 360x240. That's just VCD quality. Good thing ULead Movie Factory recognizes this as a capture device so now I capture at better video resolutions. Another one would be DScaler which is free."
1,Artless amateurs,"Ok, many people reviewing this release seem to think this band has some kind of talent. Maybe they do, if they are high-school students. The drums bang repetitively. Every song is completely predictable. And in case you have not listened to it, just hear one track. All the other ones sound the same. It's like going to a TexMex restaurant. It's all the same five ingredients, just mixed up and served a different way. Same guitar, same drums, same same same. I've heard better from small-town college bands who write their own music. Maybe Peach should practice first by doing a cover album."
3,Pretty good,"When I first heard Peach, I was unaware that Chancellorwas in it. Even so, they are not the same music, or anything close to TOOL. The only person who would say that is someone who's just jumping on the TOOL bandwagon. Peach is OK, definately in the top 10% of bands, but they aren't that great. Two kinds of people would like them: those that ""discovered"" TOOL when A Perfect Circle came out with their first CD, and those who could care less about TOOL and just like Peach's style. Definately not music hard-core TOOL fans who see as worthwhile."
4,Great CD,"Im a big Tool fan and thats how I heard about these guys. The dont sound much like Tool, but I still really like this cd."
1,An incredible let down,"From listening to this Cd, you'd never guess that Justin is in Tool now. The singer is terrible, the lyrics are a joke, the instruments are very sub par. Stay very far from this album"
2,It really isn't that good,"I think there may have been a reason Peach broke up, and it may have been because they weren't very good! Seriously though, I think this CD is a waste of money. Terrible production, an awful singer, mediocre music, and lackluster lyrics make this album almost uncomfortable to listen too. The singer can't seem to put any emotion into his singing. Everyone raves about the cover art, and even that's not that great; Adam Jones has done better. I've heard better local bands here in Providence."
